				<td>PHOTO-LABILE PRO-FRAGRANCE CONJUGATES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates, which are capable of releasing a fragrance raw material in a sequence of chemical reaction steps that include a photo-activated release of a nitrogen-containing pro-fragrance compound. The conjugates are useful in formulating fragrance delivery systems. The conjugates of the present invention are capable of delivering any type of fragrance raw material.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pro-fragrances and pro-accords have been used to enhance the delivery of fragrance raw materials and to sustain their duration. Typically pro-fragrances and pro-accords deliver alcohol, ketone, aldehyde, and ester fragrance raw materials via substrates which are hydrolyzed by one or more mechanisms, inter alia, the acidic pH of skin, nascent moisture.<br>
Fragrances or odors not only provide a pleasant aesthetic benefit, but also serve as a signal. For example, foods, which have soured or are no longer edible, may develop smells, which are repulsive and send a signal that they are no longer palatable. Therefore, the delivery of an aroma sensory signal/is also a benefit, which a pro-fragrance can provide.<br>
However, pro-fragrances and pro-accords typically rely on the break down of a chemical species not based on accidental circumstance but on deliberate execution. There are currently no fragrance or odor releasing compounds which involve release of fragrances by way of a controlled chemical cascade initiated by exposure to electromagnetic radiation, inter alia, UV light. The present invention provides a means for delivering a fragrance or an accord wherein the delivery of said fragrance or said accord is instigated by exposure to light.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the aforementioned need in that it has been surprisingly discovered that fragrance raw materials can be delivered by photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates. The photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates of the present invention are activated by the exposure of the conjugates to electromagnetic radiation, which is the initial step in a chemical cascade resulting in the ultimate release of a fragrance raw material. One of the steps in the cascade involves photochemically initiated fragmentation of a chemical bond between a photo-labile unit and a nitrogen atom contained within a pro-fragrance unit.<br>
The conjugates of the present invention comprise:<br>
a)	a photo-labile unit which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation is capable of releasing a pro-fragrance unit; and<br>
b)	a pro-fragrance unit, which when so released is either<br>
i)        a pro-fragrance compound capable of releasing a fragrance<br>
raw material; or ii)       a fragrance raw material. The present invention also relates to a photo-labile fragrance conjugate delivery system comprising:<br>
A)	from about 0.001% by weight, of a photo-labile pro-fragrance<br>
conjugate, said conjugate comprising:<br>
a)	a photo-labile unit which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation is capable of releasing a pro-fragrance unit;<br>
b)	a pro-fragrance unit, which when so released is either<br>
i)        a pro-fragrance compound capable of releasing a<br>
fragrance raw material; or ii)       a fragrance raw material; and<br>
B)	the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.<br>
These and other objects, features, and advantages will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from a reading of the following detailed description and the appended claims. All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All temperatures are in degrees<br>
Celsius (Â° C) unless otherwise specified. All documents cited are in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates, which are stable until activated by exposure to electromagnetic radiation. The conjugates of the present invention are capable of releasing any type of perfume raw material, inter alia, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, via a single- or multi-step process that is initiated by the photo-induced fragmentation of a chemical bond between the photo-labile unit and a nitrogen atom in the pro-fragrance unit.<br>
The conjugates of the present invention can be depicted as compounds having a photo-labile unit and a pro-fragrance unit which are connected to one another directly or optionally by way of a linking unit. The conjugates can be represented by the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the linking unit, L, is present when the index n is equal to 1 and absent when n is equal to 0.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "photo-labile unit" is defined herein as "a unit which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation becomes the photo-fragment compound by fragmenting from the parent photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate." In some embodiments of the present invention it may be advantageous that the photo-fragment compound does not interfere with the aesthetic quality or character of the released fragrance or pro-fragrance compound. In the presence of light, the photo-labile unit serves to trigger the chemical reaction or reaction cascade that ends with the ultimate release of one or more fragrance raw materials.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "pro-fragrance unit" is defined herein as "that portion of the photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate, which<br>
gives rise to the fragrance compound or pro-fragrance compound as a result of exposure of the photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate to electromagnetic radiation or "light."<br>
For the purpose of the present invention the term "pro-fragrance compound" is defined herein as "a chemical species, which by undergoing one or more chemical transformations results in the release of one or more fragrance compounds." Fragrance compounds and fragrance raw materials are terms which refer to the final "perfume" ingredients which are delivered and are used interchangeably herein. What is meant herein by the term "chemical transformation" includes conversion to a species of different molecular formula by any means, inter alia, hydrolysis, photolysis/thermolysis, autoxidation, addition, elimination and substitution reactions, as well as conversion to a species with the same molecular formula, but having an altered chemical orientation, i.e., isomerized.<br>
The chemical cascade, which begins the release of a fragrance raw material, may be controlled by requiring a certain wavelength of electromagnetic radiation to be present to initiate the release sequence. For example, "outside light", which typically comprises the full range of UV light, may be required to initiate the release of the fragrance precursor. In some cases, high temperatures may also initiate the chemical cascade. Photo-labile Pro-fragrance Conjugates<br>
The present invention relates to conjugates, which upon exposure to visible light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, inter alia, UV light, releases a fragrance raw material after a series of chemical transformations, wherein said series involves at least two discrete steps. The photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates of the present invention comprise:<br>
a)	a photo-labile unit, which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation is capable of releasing a pro-fragrance unit; and<br>
b)	a pro-fragrance unit, which when so released is either<br>
i)        a pro-fragrance compound capable of releasing a fragrance raw material; or<br>
i\)       a fragrance raw material. The conjugates of the present invention comprise a chemical species having a photo-activated unit which is bonded to the nitrogen atom of a pro-fragrance compound, a fragrance raw material, or a linking unit which is subsequently bonded to the nitrogen atom of a pro-fragrance compound, or a fragrance raw material, wherein said chemical bond is capable of being broken when said conjugate is exposed to electromagnetic radiation.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "hydrocarbyl" is defined herein as "any unit which comprises carbon and hydrogen atoms, whether linear, branched, cyclic, and regardless of how many of the hydrogen atoms are substituted for with a suitable "substituted" unit as defined herein below." Non-limiting examples of "hydrocarbyr units include methyl, benzyl, 6-hydroxyoctanyl, m-chlorophenyl, 2-(N-methylamino)propyl, and the like.<br>
The terms "unit which can substitute for hydrogen" and "substituted" are used throughout the specification and for the purposes of the present invention these terms are defined as "chemical moieties which can replace a hydrogen atom on a hydrocarbon chain, an aryl ring, and the like, or replacement of a hydrogen atom, two hydrogen atoms, or three hydrogen atoms from a carbon atom to form a moiety, or the replacement of hydrogen atoms from adjacent carbon atoms to form a moiety." For example, a substituted unit that requires a single hydrogen atom replacement includes halogen, hydroxyl, and the like. A two-hydrogen atom replacement includes carbonyl, oximino, and the like. Three hydrogen replacement includes cyano, and the like. The term substituted is used throughout the present specification to indicate that a moiety, inter alia, aromatic ring, alkyl chain, can have one or more of the hydrogen atoms replaced by a substituent. For example, 4-hydroxyphenyl is a "substituted aromatic carbocyclic ring", and 3-guanidinopropyl is a "substituted C3 alkyl unit."<br>

Photo-labile Units<br>
The photo-labile units of the present invention may be any moiety, which is capable of instigating the release of a fragrance raw material by breaking the chemical bond between the photo-labile unit and one of three components:<br>
a)	a fragrance raw material unit thereby directly releasing a fragrance raw material;<br>
b)	a pro-fragrance unit thereby instigating a sequence of one or more chemical transformations which release a fragrance raw material; or<br>
c)	a linking group which further undergoes a sequence of one or more chemical transformations which subsequently release a fragrance raw material or pro-fragrance unit.<br>
A first aspect of photo-labile units according to the present invention relate<br>
to units which are aryl acrylic acid units having the formula:<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R is a fragrance raw material or a unit capable of releasing a fragrance raw material; each R1 is independently hydrogen, a unit which can substitute for hydrogen, C1-C12 substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl unit, each R2 is independently hydrogen, C1-C12 substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl unit, and mixtures thereof; X is selected from the group consisting of -OH, -OC(O)R12, -OC(O)OR12, -NHR12, and mixtures thereof; R12 is H, C1-C12<br>
substituted nsubstituted alkyl, and mixtures thereof. These units are capable of releasing a fragrance raw material unit, a pro-fragrance unit, or a linking group bonded fragrance raw material unit or pro-fragrance unit; the photo-fragment compound having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which can optionally be a fragrance raw material itself, inter alia, coumarin.<br>
Non-limiting examples of photo-labile units included in this first aspect include a pro-fragrance wherein X is -NH2, the R1 unit is hydroxy, and both R2 units are hydrogen which relates to 3-(2-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)-acrylamide fragrance raw materials having the formula:<br>

Another example relates to photo-labile units having the formula:<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein both R1 and X are hydroxy!.<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
Linking Units<br>
Depending upon the structure of the photo-labile unit and the rate at which the formulator desires the final fragrance raw material to be released, the use of an optional linking unit, L, may be desired or necessary. An example of a compound having an L unit present has the formula:<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br><br>
one embodiment of which has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to L units which are -OC(O)-, -NR3C(O)-, -OC(R3R4)-, and -C(O)- carbonyl units. However, any suitable unit which facilitates the breakdown of the released pro-fragrance can serve as a linking unit in the photo-activated pro-fragrance conjugates of the present invention.<br>
When the pro-fragrance unit is released from the photo-labile unit when a linker unit is present, the release of the photo-fragment compound and pro-fragrance or fragrance compound is accompanied by the release of a linker<br>
compound. For example, when the L unit is -OC(O)-, the linker compound is CO2.<br>
When the L unit is -OC(R3R4)- the linker compound released can be an aldehyde or a ketone. In one aspect of the present invention, the aldehyde or ketone released is a perfume raw material.<br>
Non-limiting examples of photo-activated compounds comprising an L unit include:<br>

Pro-fragrance units are released from the parent conjugate molecules when the conjugate is fragmented by a photochemical reaction. The pro-fragrance units of the present invention are attached to the photo-labile units either directly or by way of an optional linking unit, L.<br>
As will be understood by the formulator, not all fragrance raw materials can be released from the same form of pro-fragrance. The two primary aspects of the present invention as it relates to release of a pro-fragrance unit are determined by the type of reaction which ultimately releases the final fragrance raw material.<br>

The following is a non-limiting example of the oxazolidone embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Hydrolysis based release of the fragrance raw material can proceed by way of any hydrolyzabie pro-fragrance compound which is initiated by the release of the pro-fragrance unit from a photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate. For example, the ionone series of ketone fragrance raw materials, unlike the damascone series delivered by Type A Release, are formed into photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates in which the photo-labile unit is connected to a pro-fragrance unit consisting of a pro-fragrance compound that is an imine or an enamine that are themselves formed from the reaction of an aldehyde or ketone fragrance raw material with an amine compound. The imine- or iminium-based pro-fragrance compounds are released upon activation of the conjugate. The following is an example of a photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate that is capable of releasing an enamine-based pro-fragrance compound of the present invention.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The Type B Release photo-activated pro-fragrances can also comprise a suitable linking group for example a compound having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Another type of Type B Release relates to aminals or ketals having, for example, the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
which is capable of releasing an aldehyde or ketone fragrance raw material having the formula R5CHO or R5R6CHO and an alcohol having the formula ROH.<br>
R OH can be a fragrance raw material or not a fragrance raw material depending on the needs of the formulator. A non-limiting example of an aminal according to the present invention has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The formulator when using aminals to deliver two fragrance raw materials can make use of the R3 nitrogen unit to control the release rate of the fragrance raw materials once the photo-labile unit has released the pro-fragrance component. The formulator can make use of the R3 nitrogen unit to control the physical properties of the photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate. Such properties include, but are not limited to, the ability of the conjugate to deposit on a desired surface in an aqueous wash environment.<br>
A further example of Type B Release relates to conjugates which are activated by the breaking of the bond between the photo-labile unit and the pro-fragrance unit, wherein an intramolecular reaction ensues which displaces a pro-fragrance compound which then hydrolyzes to release the fragrance raw material. A non-limiting general example is the amino-amide photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate depicted in the scheme below:<br>

Fragrance Raw Materials<br>
Mixtures of fragrance materials are known by those skilled in the art of fragrances and perfumes as "accords". The term "accord" as used herein is defined as "a mixture of two or more 'fragrance raw materials' which are artfully combined to impart a pleasurable scent, odor, essence, or fragrance characteristic". For the purposes of the present invention "fragrance raw materials" are herein defined as compounds having a molecular weight of at least 100 g/mol and which are useful in imparting an odor, fragrance, essence, or scent either alone or in combination with other "fragrance raw materials". For the purposes of the present invention, fragrance raw materials which comprise an<br>
amino unit can be directly attached to the photo-labile unit and, therefore, released directly without further reaction.<br>
Typically "fragrance raw materials" comprise inter alia alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, esters, ethers, nitriles, and alkenes such as terpenes. A listing of common "fragrance raw materials" can be found in various reference sources, for example, "Perfume and Flavor Chemicals", Vols. I and II; Steffen Arctander Allured Pub. Co.

Odor Detection Threshold<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the term "odor detection threshold" is defined as the level at which a fragrance raw material is perceptible to the average human. The odor detection threshold (ODT) of the compositions of the present invention are preferably measured by carefully controlled gas chromatograph (GC) conditions as described hereinbelow.<br>
Determination of Odor Detection Thresholds is as follows. A gas chromatograph is characterized to determine the exact volume of material injected by a syringe, the precise split ratio, and the hydrocarbon response using a hydrocarbon standard of known concentration and chain-length distribution. The airflow rate in accurately measured and, assuming the duration of a human inhalation to last 0.02 minutes, the sampled volume is calculated. Since the precise concentration at the detector at any point in time is known, the mass per volume inhaled is known and hence the concentration of material. To determine whether a material has a threshold below 10 ppb, solutions are delivered to the sniff port at the back-calculated concentration. A panelist sniffs the GC effluent<br>
and identifies the retention time when odor is notice. The average over all<br>
panelists determines the threshold of noticeability or ODT. The necessary<br>
amount of analyte is injected onto the column to achieve a 10 ppb concentration<br>
at the detector. Typical gas chromatograph parameters for determining odor<br>
detection thresholds are listed below.<br>

FORMULATIONS The present invention relates to a photo-labile fragrance delivery system which delivers a photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate. The pro-fragrance relies upon the photo-initiated cascade to deliver the fragrance raw material. Because it is not necessary that the pro-fragrance compound immediately begins releasing an aldehyde or ketone once the photo-labile unit has released said pro-fragrance compound, the formulator may form a wide array of delivery systems. In general, the systems of the present invention comprise several embodiments having various ranges of pro-fragrance conjugate, for example:<br>
a)       from about 0.001 % to about 5%, another embodiment comprises from about 0.005% to about 1%, a range of from about 0.01% to about 0.2% encompasses yet another embodiment, while a further embodiment comprises from about 0.02% to about 0.1% by weight, of a photo-activated pro-fragrance conjugate, said conjugate comprising:<br>
i)        a photo-labile unit which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation is capable of releasing a pro-fragrance unit as a pro-fragrance compound; and ii)       a pro-fragrance compound, which when so released is capable of releasing a fragrance raw material; and<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to conjugates of the present invention that comprise a photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugate comprising a photo-labile unit which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation is capable of releasing a pro-fragrance unit as a fragrance compound.<br>
b)       the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.<br>
The photo-labile pro-fragrances of the present invention have wide utility in perfumes and fine fragrances. This embodiment of the present invention comprises:<br>
A)	from about 0.001 % by weight, of one or more photo-activated pro-<br>
fragrance conjugates, said conjugates each comprising:<br>
a)	a photo-labile unit which upon exposure to electromagnetic radiation is capable of releasing a pro-fragrance unit;<br>
b)	a pro-fragrance unit, which when so released is either<br>
i)        a pro-fragrance compound capable of releasing a<br>
fragrance raw material; or ii)       a fragrance raw material;<br>
B)	from about 0.01% to about 99% by weight, of an admixture of fragrance raw material; and<br>
C)	the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.<br>
Typically the carrier for fine fragrances and perfumes is ethanol or ethanol/water. In addition to the photo-labile conjugates of the present invention, other pro-fragrances, pro-accords, and the like can be included, especially species which take advantage of the differential pH of skin. For example, acid labile pro-fragrances include orthoesters, acetals, ketals, and the like. Therefore, the combination of a photo-labile pro-fragrance and an acid labile pro-fragrance which releases the same fragrance raw material, inter alia, damascone, citronellal, is one aspect encompassed by the present invention.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the terms "perfume" and "fine fragrance" are essentially synonymous and are used collectively or interchangeably throughout the present specification and are taken to mean the more concentrated forms of fragrance-containing compositions. Aspects of the<br>
present invention which apply to "perfumes" will therefore apply equally to "fine fragrances" and vice versa. Typically, colognes, eau de toilettes, after shaves, and other fragrance-containing embodiments are perfumes or fine fragrances which have a greater degree of dilution, usually by a volatile carrier such as ethanol.<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following are additional non-limiting embodiments of the present invention. Skin Conditioning Lotions<br>
An example of a skin care composition of the present invention comprises an ester having a total number of carbon atoms in excess of about 28, for example lauryl laurate, lauryl myristate, myristyl myristate, behenyl caprate, cetearyl palmitate, behenyl stearate, more preferably cetearyl palmitate and cetyl stearate.<br>
The present compositions in addition to the esters described herein above, contain an emollient material in an amount such that the amount of ester plus emollient is from about 0.2%, preferably from about 4% to about 25%, preferably to about 18% of the total composition. One function of the emollient is to ensure that the ester is plasticized sufficiently to allow it to be in a film-like state on the skin. The emollient in the present compositions is selected from the group consisting of fatty alcohols, esters having fewer than about 24 total carbon atoms (e.g. isopropyl palmitate), branched chain esters having greater than about 24 total carbon atoms (e.g. cetearyl octonate), squalane, liquid or solid paraffins, mixtures of fatty acids and squalane, mixtures of fatty acids and liquid or solid paraffins and mixtures thereof. The aforementioned esters, those having fewer than 24 carbon atoms or branched and having more than 24 carbon atoms, if used as an emollient should preferably be used in an mount equal to about a third of the long chain ester. The particular emollient selected depends in part on the particular ester selected since proper plasticization, as indicated above, is desired. The emollient for the esters having more than 28 carbon atoms is<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of squalane, liquid or solid paraffins and mixtures of fatty alcohols with squalane or paraffins. Typical fatty alcohols and fatty acids useful in the present compositions include those having from 12-22 carbon atoms such as cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, stearic acid and palmitic acid. Paraffins include, for example, mineral oil, petrolatum and paraffin wax. It is preferred that distilled water be used in the present compositions.<br>
Optional Components<br>
Oil Phase Components<br>
In addition to the long chain esters, emollients and emulsifiers described previously, the oil phase of the present compositions may contain a variety of materials including:<br>
(a)	Esters not meeting the requirements for the long chain ester and not present as an emollient, supra, such as oleyl oleate, isostearyl isostearate, isopropyl lanolate, isopropyl myristate, butyl stearate, myristyl lactate and 2-ethyl hexyl palmitate;<br>
(b)	Oils such as castor oil, jojoba oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil and sesame oil;<br>
(c)	Waxes such as ceresin wax, carnuba wax, beeswax and castor wax;<br>
(d)	Lanolin, its derivatives and components such as acetylated lanolin, lanolin alcohols and lanolin fatty acids. Lanolin fatty acids are described in U.S. Pat. No. Re. 29,814, Oct. 24,1978 to W. E. Snyder incorporated herein by reference.<br>
(e)	Polyalkylenes such as hydrogenated polyisobutene and polyethylene; and<br>
(f)	Sterols such as cholesterol and phytosterol.<br>
These optional oil phase materials may comprise up to about 80% of the oil phase, preferably up to about 35%. When used at these levels, the optional components do not impair the occlusive nature of the compositions and add to the composition's total cosmetic performance.<br>
Water Phase Components<br>
The water phase of the compositions may contain many different materials including:<br>
(a)	Humectants, such as sorbitol, glycerine, propylene glycol, alkoxylated glucose and hexanetriol at a level of from about 1% to about 20%.<br>
(b)	Thickening agents such as carboxyvinyl polymers, ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, carboxymethyl cellulose, vegetable gums and clays such as<br>
Veegum.RTM. (magnesium aluminum silicate, R. T. Vanderbilt, Inc.) at a level of from about 0.01 % to about 6%;<br>
(c)	Proteins and polypeptides at a level of from about 0.1 % to about 3%;<br>
(d)	Preservatives such as the methyl, ethyl, propyl and butyl esters of hydroxybenzoic acid (Parabens-Mallinckrodt Chemical Corporation) EDTA and imidazolidinyl urea (Germall 115-Sutton Laboratories) at a level of from about 0.2% to about 2.5%; and<br>
(e)	An alkaline agent such as sodium hydroxide to neutralize, if desired, part of the fatty acids or thickener which may be present.<br>
All of the percentages of these additional water phase components are of the total composition.<br>
The present compositions may also contain agents suitable for aesthetic purposes such as dyes. The compositions of the present invention are preferably substantially free of materials that adversely affect their performance. Therefore, such things as polyethylene glycols are preferably present only at levels below about 1% of the total composition. The pH of the present compositions is preferably in the range of about 7.5-10.<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURE The compositions which comprise the skin lotion embodiments of the present invention generally have a lotion consistency and may be in the form of oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions with the former being preferred because of their more pleasing cosmetic properties. The compositions of the present invention are preferably made by the method comprising the steps of;<br>
a)	preparing the oil phase;<br>
b)	preparing the water phase; and<br>
c)	adding the oil phase to the water phase.<br>
Step (a) is carried out by heating the oil phase materials to a temperature of about 75 C to about 100 Â°C. Step (b) is carried out by heating the water phase materials to a temperature about the same as that of the oil phase. The emulsion is formed by slowly adding the oil phase prepared in step (a) to the water phase prepared in step (b) with stirring. The pro-accords which comprise the fragrance delivery system or other ingredients may be added to the phase in which they are soluble prior to the mixing of the two phases or added directly to the mixed water and oil phases.<br>
In addition to the fragrance-containing compositions for use on human skin, the pro-accords of the present invention are also suitable for use in any odor controlling or fragrance mediating application. An example of this odor control capacity is animal litter and odor control articles useful in lining the cages, stalls, and other living areas of domesticated animals. For example, U.S. 5,339,769 Toth et al., issued August 23,1994 describes a process for making an absorbent composition, which can well accommodate the pro-accord materials of the present invention.<br>
An example of a suitable litter material which comprises the photo-labile pro-fragrance conjugates of the present invention can be formed by the following process.<br>
A Glatt fluid bed granulator is charged with 1,0000 g of bentonite clay (90 % of the particles being greater than 420 microns) and 10 g of a cellulose ether (Methocel â¢ K15M Premium, a cellulose ether having a viscosity of 15,000 centipoise (cps) as a 2% aqueous solution). The granulator is started and the product temperature is brought up to about 40 C (outlet temperature). When the outlet temperature reaches about 40 C, atomized water is sprayed onto the moving powders within the granulator, During the granulation process, inlet air temperature is maintained at 70 Â°C to 80 C; air atomization pressure is 28-35 psi; and the spraying cycle is for 45 seconds with a 15 second shaking time.<br>
The clay/cellulose ether agglomerates swell over time. The water hydrates the cellulose ether polymer, which produces adhesion to form the granule. At this time it is more advantageous to introduce the pro-accord materials and other aesthetic fragrances. The formation of the granule promotes aggregation of the small sized particles of the inert substrate, e.g. clay particles of about 50 to 600 microns. The formation of a granule significantly reduces the quality of dust in the final product while the litter forms an agglomerate when wetted.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the clay-based litter box articles/pro-accord admixture, once the clay particles have been formed, a concentrated solution, or a carrier alcohol-based admixture of the pro-accords may be delivered to the surface of the granule by a suitable means.<br>

dispersion and heated with stirring to 70-80 C. In a separate vessel, the Phase<br>
B ingredients are heated with stirring to 70-80 Â°C. Phase B is then added to<br>
Phase A with mixing to form the emulsion. Next, Phase C is added to neutralize the composition. The Phase D ingredients are added with mixing, followed by<br>
cooling to 45-50 Â°C. The Phase E ingredients are then added with stirring,<br>
followed by cooling to 40 Â°C. Phase F is heated with mixing to 40 C. and added to the emulsion, which is cooled to room temperature. The resulting cleansing composition is useful for cleansing the skin. The emulsion de-emulsifies upon contact with the skin.<br>
