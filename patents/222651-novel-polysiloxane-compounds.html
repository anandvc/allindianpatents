Sunscreens<br>
The present invention relates to novel sunscreens on the basis of polysiloxanes, to their preparation and to their use, especially in formulations for the protection against harmful effects of sunlight.<br>
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population that is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. Repetitive sun exposure can result in skin changes known as photoaged skin. The clinical changes that are seen in photoaged skin differ from those of normally aged skin in sunlight protected sites of the body. Among the damaging results of intensive sun exposure of the skin there is increased wrinkling, elastosis, pigmentary changes, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions.<br>
Many sunscreening chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effects of UVA (320 - 400 nm) and/or UVB (290 - 320 nm) wavelengths. These chemicals have been incorporated either alone or in combination with each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used. However, these is a need for the development of even more potent sunscreening chemicals and preparations containing them as well as of easier and economically more attractive chemical syntheses thereof, especialiy in view of further depletion of the ozon layer of the earth to be expected with concurrent increasing doses of UVA and UVB and even shorter wavelengths (UVC) to be endured.<br><br>
'the present invention, therefore, provides nev.1 p<..l>:a-ne-based sunscreen compounds, a method for their preparation and cormelic or pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
More particularly the new compounds of the present invention are substituted polysiioxanes containing a certain number of the following structural elements per molecule, viz.<br>
one element of formula    (H3C)3-Si-	(1),<br>
one element of formula    -0-Si(CH3)3	(II),<br>
2 to 200, preferably 5 to SO, elements in arbitrary order which are either identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br>
-0-Si(CH;)[CHtCH3)R']-	(Ilia),<br>
-0-Si(CH5)(CH2-CH2-R')-	(IHb),<br>
-O-SKOiOlC^ChWR1]-	(Hie), and<br>
-O-Si(CH.0(CH=CH-R1)-	(Hid);<br>
2 to 200, elements in arbitrary order which are either identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[CH(CH3)R2]-	(IVa),<br>
-0-Si{CH3)(CH2-CHrR2)-	(IVb),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[C(=CH2)R2]-	(IVc),   and<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH=CH-R2)-	(IVd);<br>
optionally 1 to 100, preferably I to 10, elements in arbitrary order which are either identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br><br>
-O- :-itCH-,)|CHlCH;,)f: V	iVaj,<br>
-O-SifCH^O^-CH-R1)-	fVb),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[C(=CH3;K3]-	(Vc),   3nd<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH=CH-R3)-	(Vd);<br>
and optionally 1 - 20 elements in arbitrary order of formula -*0-SiH(CH3)-    (VI)<br>
wherein R is a UV light absorbing group;<br>
R is hydrogen or a lipophilic group;<br>
R" is a group which is able to form ionogenic or hydrogen bonds,<br>
The term "in arbitrary order" means that there is no specific order or sequence of the elements of formulae III a - III d, IV a - IV d, V a - V d and VI in the polysiloxane molecule and that the order or sequence of the elements may vary from molecule to molecule.<br>
Elements may be "identical" or "different from each other". This means that there maybe present only one type of an element of formula Ilia - Hid and/or of formula IVa -IVd and/or of formula V a • V d wherein again each of the substituents R1, R~ and R may be identical or different from each other. Thus, all possible combinations of different elements as defined above are comprised by the present invention. For example the sunscreen molecules of the present invention may contain 1- 200 entities of a single type of UV absorbing groups (chromophores), viz. only one type of UVA or UVB absorbing group. Alternatively, two or more different types of UVA and/or UVB absorbing groups may be present in the same molecule in arbitrary order. If protection against a broad wavelength spectrum is desired the use of different groups with different absorption maxima, including UVC absorbing groups, may be preferable.<br>
Thus, e.g., a polysiioxane compound of formula (H3C)3Si-[-0-Si{CH3)(CHrCHrRI)]3i-[-0-Si(CH3)(C[=CH2]-R2)]I3-0-Si(CH3)3<br>
contains in arbitrary order 44 silyloxy groups, 31 of which being groups of formula [lib with chromophores R {R1 being identical or different from each other), 13 of which Deing groups of formula IVc with hydrogen or lipophilic substitutents R" (R being dentical or different from each other).<br><br>
The polysil-xrane compounds of th-: pres-ent invention an fre prepared by reacting a polymtthylhydrosiloxane of the general formula<br>
CH.,<br>
(H3C)3Si-[-0-SiH|m-0-Si(CH3)j	(VII)<br>
wherein m is an integer of 4 to 520, preferably of 10 to 200 and more preferably of 20 to 60,<br>
with terminally unsaturated compounds of formulae<br>
H:C = CH - R1 (Villa)   and    H2C = CH-R2	(VHIb)<br>
and/orHCHC-Rl(IXa)     and/or  HC=C-R2 (fXb) and optionally H2C = CH - R3 (Xa)     and/or   HCsC- R3 (Xb),<br>
wherein R , R and R are as defined above,<br>
in the presence of a noble metal catalyst.<br>
UV-iight absorbing groups comprise all groups which absorb light in the range of wavelengths 400 - 320 nm (UVA) and 320 - 290 (UVB) or of even shorter wavelengths (UVC) and which are or can be used as chemical UV filters. These groups are, e.g., residues of compounds belonging to the groups of p-aminobenzoates, salicylates, cinnamates, benzophenones, anthranilates, dibenzoylmethanes, camphor derivatives (such as of benzylidene camphor type), phenyl-benzimidazoles, phenyl-benzoxazoles, phenyl-benzotriazoles and others representing state of the art and known to those skilled in the art to be highly active.<br>
The UV-light absorbing groups or compounds mentioned above can be easily modified using methods well-known to a person skilled in the art to yield compounds of formulae Villa and IXa above.<br><br>
Examples of preferred compound:, of formula- Villa and IXa ari:<br><br>
wherein R is hydrogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain Ci_20"alkyl, -alkoxy or Ci-2fl-3lkenyl,<br>
Lipophilic groups are groups with specific affinity to lipids and well-known to persons skilled in the art. Of special interest in the context of the present invention are aromatic, aliphatic and araliphatic hydrocarbon groups. Preferred are straight or branched chain aliphatic hydrocarbon groups with 1 - 20 carbon atoms, one or more isolated methylene groups of which maybe replaced by oxygen. Examples of such groups are methyl, ethyl, propyl, i-propj'l, butyl, i-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, decyl, methoxy, efhoxy, butoxy, methoxymethoxy, ethoxyethoxy, butoxyethoxy, vinyl, alkyl, 2-butenyl, 1,3-butadienyl, etc.<br>
Consequently, examples of compounds of formulae Vlllb and IXb are those wherein R has one of the above-mentioned meanings, viz., ethylene and acetylene (R" = H), 1-propen, 1 propyne, 1-butene, 1-butyne, 1-pentene, 1-pentyne, 1-heptane, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 3-ethyl-1 -pentene, vinyl-methyl-ether, vinyl-ethyl-ether, 1 -vinyloxy-methane, 1 -<br><br>

The presence of groups R , i.e. groups able to form ionogenic or hydrogen bonds, in the polysiloxanes of the present invention may be desirable to increase the adhesion of the polysiloxanes to the objects to be protected from the damaging influence of UV radiation, in case of persons skin or hair. Such groups are well-known to the person skilled in the art. Most of these groups are characterized by the existence of free electron pairs. Representatives of such groups are saturated and unsaturated aliphatic and heterocyclic groups having polar substituents with one or more free electron pairs which substituents maybe integrated in the carbon chain or ring system. Examples of such substituents are hydroxy, oxo, oxa, carboxy, sulfo, amino, imino and glycyl groups including their salts. Examples of preferred compounds of formulae Xa and Xb are<br><br>
Although not desired, the compounds of the present invention may contain 1 to 20 elements of formula VI, viz. unreacted elements from the starting material. This may be the case when sufficient amounts of reactants of formulae VIII and IX and optionally X were lacking in the reaction mixture or did not react quantitatively for whatever reason. Such compounds are undesired by-products and should be eliminated, since due to the reactivity of the Si-H bond they are not very stable. This can be done, e.g., by a further reaction step. Preferably* elements of formula VI are absent from compounds of the present invention.<br><br>
The ratio of groups of formula III to formula IV in the compounds i&gt;r the present invention is not critical. While the preferable mol ratio of the groups is dependent on their molecular weights, the preferable weight ratio of III; IV is about 1:1.<br>
The conditions for the reaction of the polymethylhydrosiloxane of formula VII with the compounds of formulae VIII - X to yield the compounds of the present invention are generally those known to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The reaction is conducted in an organic solvent, e.g., an aliphatic, possibly chlorinated, or aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene; an alcohol such as isopropano!; an ether such as THf; or a polar aprotic solvent, such as DMF, which is preferably part of the solvent as a solubilizer.<br>
The reaction temperature, depending upon the reactants, is in the range of 40 to 150°Cand preferably about $0°C. The reaction time may vary between 2 and 4S hours.<br>
Preferred noble metal catalysts are platinum metal catalysts, viz. Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru, with platinum being especially preferred. The catalyst can be in heterogeneous phase, e.g., on charcoal or, preferably, in homogeneous phase (Karstedt catalyst).<br>
The reactants are reacted in the desired molecular ratios of the substituents R , R" and R in the end product either simultaneously or successively under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably under nitrogen or argon. Typically, the polymethylhydrosiloxane is reacted in a first step with a compound of formula Villa and optionally of formula Xa carrying the chromophore and optionally substituent R in the desired molecular ratio(s), in the presence of an insufficient amount of the lipophilic compound of formula VHIband adding an excess of compound Vlllb in a second step. M the end of the reaction time the still existing excess of compound Vlllb is removed. Jt is evident that the product obtained is a mixture of different polymethvlsiloxanes statistically substituted with residues carrying groups R and R" and optionally RSince the compounds of formulae VIII to Xcan react in 1 - or 2-position {of the terminal double or triple bond) with the polymethylhydrosilane of formula VII a mixture of vicinal (1.2-substitution) and geminal (2.2-substitution) - relative to the terminal double or triple bond of compound VIII toX- reaction products is obtained which can be used as sunscreens without previous separation of its components.<br><br>

The polysiloxane compounds of the present invention can be used as sunscreens. They are suitable for the protection of human sldn and/or hair from damaging effects of UV radiation, as well as for protection o( UV sensitive plastic materials, medicinal products and other objects.<br>
Therefore, the polysiloxane compounds can be converted into compositions, particularly into topical compositions, in combination with pharmaceutical^ and/or cosmetically acceptable excipients.<br>
The compositions comprising the compounds of the present invention are particularly suitable for topical applications onto human skin and/or hair.<br>
If desired, additional UV-A and UV-B screening agents maybe added to the cosmetic and/or dermatological compositions of the present invention. The combination of different UV filters may also show synergistic effects.<br>
