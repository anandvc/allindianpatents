				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of phytosterols from deodourizer distillate from vegetable oils<br>
Phytosterols such as ß-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterols have received scientific attention recently because of their health promotion as feedstock for pharmaceuticals Phytosterols as health food supplement has attributed to their cholesterol lowering effect as evidenced by numerous scientific studies Phytosterols are widely distributed among plants and plant products with oil seeds being very rich source They occur as free sterols and esterified fatty acids and ferulic acids etc Being fat-soluble phytosterols get extracted along with oil when oil seeds are processed for vegetable oil production with concentration ranging from 1 0 to 2 0 % During physical refining of edible oils, sufficient amount of these sterols get distilled along with free fatty acids and other minor constituents in the deodourizer and deacidification process Thus the by- product namely deodourizer distillate (DOD) of vegetable oils, which is rich commercial source for phytosterols, tocopherols, squalene etc, is of secondary importance Consequent to the demand for health food supplements recovery of phytosterols from DOD through commercially feasible process assumes importance Currently products like margarines and shortenings fortified with phytosterols are marketed Phytosterols have been shown to prevent reabsorption of cholesterol from the gut resulting lowering cholesterol<br>
In this new process, phytosterols with more than 97% purity was obtained from DOD by simple estenfication and crystallization method, which is cost effective and commercially adaptable After estenfication excess of the methanol was separated by vacuum distillation and acid catalyst removed by water washing followed by crystallization and filtration that yielded free sterols as crystals The impurities in the crystals could be removed using chilled hexane to obtain 97-99 % pure sterol crystals<br>
The other products obtained are fatty acid methyl esters and residue left after crystal separation nch in tocopherols The fatty acid methyl esters (95%) could be used for oleochemicals or for bio-diesel while the residue could be further processed to recover high purity tocopherols The process presented here is an integrated approach to value addition to DOD through recovery of all the constituents of high purity that otherwise treated as low value product<br>
One of the prior patents [Eastman Kodak Co, Published at the patent office, 25 Southampton Building, London, WC2 Separation of sterols Patent Number GB895145 (1962)] sterols separated after sopaonification, neutralization, and solvent extraction In this<br>
method DOD was saponified with methanolic alkaline medium and acidulated the saponified mixture and separated glycerol-contaimng compounds by water washing and finally sterols extracted with a solvent mixture of methanol, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and water The residue containing fatty acids therefore it is difficult to isolate other components like tocopherols, squalene etc from the mother liquor [Hobman Peter Graeme C O New Ze, Keen Alan Robert C O Neala, Ward David Douglas C New Zeala, New Zealand Dairy Res Inst (NZ) Improvements in or relating to methods of removing sterols and /or other steroidal compounds from edible fats and/ or oil from which such sterols and/or other steroidal Compounds have been removed. European Patent No EP 03293 47 (1989)] in this study a solvent system was used to separate the sterols from fats and/or oils The authors could reduces campesterols 313 ppm to 239 ppm removal is 23 6%, stigmasterols 303 ppm to 217 ppm removal is 28 4%, P-sitosterol 752 ppm to 627 ppm removal is 16 6% from the soy bean oil remaining sterols retained in the oil phase This method is useful to reduce the steroidal compounds from the source not for the complete separation which contains lower range of steroidal compound In yet another patent [Kodah Dharma R (US), Cargill INC (US), Removal of Sterols from fats and oils, US patent No 6303803 (2001)] Sterols were separated from the fats and oils by this method, extraction of sterols from fats and oils to lecithin water phase This method was indented towards for the reduction of sterols in the oils and fats and therefore not for the complete separation of the sterols from the oil and DOD In another patent [Eastman Kodak Co, W P Thopson&amp;Co, 12, Church Street, Liverpool, Charted patent Agents Improvements m high vacuum distillation of materials containing sterols Patent Number GB489623] Sterols concentrated using short path high vacuum distillation and purified by solvent extraction and crystallization or removed the fatty matter by saponification and solvent extraction purity and yield not mentioned, this process was combination of High vacuum distillation and solvent extraction In a recent patent [I P Holdings, LLC [US/US] 12700 west Dodge Road, Omaha, NE 68154(US), Copeland, Dick [US/US] 12929 Seward street, Omaha, NE68154 (US) Belcher, Maurice [US/US] 16124 Dewey Avenue, Omaha, NE 68154[US](2003)] Methods for treating Deodorizer distillate, International patent Number WO 03/080778 A2] sterols and tocopherols in Soybean oil DOD were concentrated for the ftirther purification In this process acetone was used to separate sterols and tocopherols from the residue The purity of the sterols after the fatty acid distillation and acetone separation was only 76% [From the above reports it could be reasonably assumed that an<br>

DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The new process based on SODD is briefly as follows Soya bean oil Deodorizer Distillate contains approximately 5 to 15 % free sterols Free sterols are mixture of ß-sitosterol (35-45 %), campesterol (15-25%), Stigmasterol (35-45%) and Avenasterol (2-8%) (Table 2) The distillate also contains about 2% moisture and other constituents (Table 1) And also it is rich source for tocopherols and tocotrienols (Table 3) The Distillate was first dried under vacuum to remove the moisture content and the residual moisture content was brought down to 
the cooling time the crystals were filtered under vacuum Filtration is usually employed to separate the fractionally crystallized sterols from the mother liquor, although any of the other well-known methods of separating solids from liquids such as decanting, and centrifiigation can also be utilized After filtration chilled hexane 4-10 C was passed through the crystal bed to punfy sterol crystals Finally the crystals were dried at ambient condition until free from residual solvent The phytosterols crystals thus obtained were analyzed for yield and purity using TLC, HPLC, GC-MS, and NMR (Table 4)<br>

funnel under vacuum The crystal collected was washed with chilled hexane at 4 C The crystals were dried, yield and purity were checked (Table 5)<br>
Example 5<br>
1000 g of the SODD was dried under vacuum and mixed with equal volume of 98 2 methanolic sulphunc acid reagents and stirred vigorously for 2 Hrs After the esterification excess of the methanol was distilled out under vacuum To the mixture added 500 ml of brine solution at 80°C and removed the lower layer The mixture washed with 250 ml of hot distilled water until free from acid and salt The esterified mixture was crystallized at 10°C for 8 hrs in a crystallizer After crystallization the mixture was filtered through a Buckner funnel under vacuum and the residue was washed with chilled hexane at 4°C The crystals were dried, purity and yield were checked (Table 5)<br>
Pilot Plant Trials<br>
Example 6<br>
10 Kg of the SODD was Esterified with 98 2 methanolic sulphuric acid reagent and stirred vigorously for 4 Hrs After the esterification excess of the methanol was distilled out To the mixture added hot water at 80°C and removed the lower layer The esterified mixture was crystallized in a crystallization unit Winterized the esterified mass to 10 °C and maintained at this temperature with periodic slow stirring for 15 hrs in a crystallizer After crystallization the mixture was filtered using vacuum filtration system and the residue was washed with chilled hexane at 4°C The crystals were dried and purity and yield were checked (Table 6)<br>
Example 7<br>
In another 10 Kg batch after all the process were carried out as above and filtration was done in a continuous rotary vacuum filter The sterols filtered were scrapped from the surface of the filter and washed the crystals with chilled hexane (4°C) and purity and yield were checked (Table 6)<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are the following<br>
1	This process is effective for the isolation of free sterols from SODD without affecting the nature of the other useful compounds<br>
2	In this process free sterols separated in the beginning of the SODD fractionation, which facilitate further treatment of the SODD<br>
3	In other process like molecular distillation and supercritical fractionation, the fractions contain other impunties requmng further fractionation But here sterols only are separated by crystallization<br>
4	By this process sterols obtained was pure and no need for further purification like solvent extraction, saponification, etc<br>
5	After crystallization of sterols the residue contains methyl esters, steryl esters, Squalene, Tocopherols and traces of unknown compounds Separations of these useful compounds can be integrated to sterol process with minimum additional steps and facilities<br>
6	In this process MeOH H2SO4 mixture was used as reagent for esterification and compared to other enzymatic, molecular distillation, supercntical process and this is simple and cost effective process<br>
7	After simple washing with hexane yields very pure sterol crystals and therefore no recrystallization is required and hence higher yield of sterols<br>
8 After estarification and water washing the excess methanol can be recovered by distillation and reused for esterification<br>
9	The hexane used for washing is also reusable<br>
10	The residue obtained after hexane wash is recycled to recover sterols present in the residue<br>
11	By this process maximum separation of the pure sterols facilitate the further separation of sterylesters, Tocopherols squalene etc<br><br><br>
