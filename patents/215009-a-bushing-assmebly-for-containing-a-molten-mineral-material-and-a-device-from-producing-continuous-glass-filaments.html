				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a bushing assembly/support structure arrangement<br>
wherein the bushing assembly is adapted to receive a molten material and<br>
includes a plurality of nozzles through which the molten material passes prior to<br>
being attenuated into continuous fibers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the manufacture of continuous glass fibers, glass forming batch ingredients<br>
are added to a melter where they are heated to a molten condition. The molten<br>
glass travels from the melter to one or more bushing assemblies by way of a<br>
glass delivery system, example, a channel and a forehearth. Each bushing has a<br>
number of nozzles or tips through which streams of molten glass flow via gravity.<br>
Those streams are mechanically drawn to form continuous glass fibers by way of<br>
a winder or like device.<br>
A prior art bushing assembly is illustrated in Figure 1. It comprises a bushing<br>
main body 10 having a plurality of side walls 11 (only one of which is illustrated)<br>
and a tip plate 12 extending between the side walls 10. The tip plate 12 includes<br>
the nozzles 12a through which the streams of molten glass flow via gravity. A<br>
first support rail 20 is coupled to a first side wall of the bushing main body 10. A<br>
second support rail (not shown) is coupled to a second, opposing side wall of the<br>
main body 10. A plurality of C-shaped support brackets 30 (only one of which is<br>
illustrated in Figure 1) are coupled to the first and second support rails 20 and<br>
the side walls 11 of the main body 10. Each support bracket 30 comprises outer<br>
members 30a and 30b, which are integral with and extend generally orthogonal<br>
to a generally horizontal intermediate member 30c. Ends of the outer members<br>
30a and 30b opposite the ends integral with the intermediate member 30c are<br>
coupled to a corresponding support rail and main body side wall. A like number<br>
of support straps 40 (only one of which is illustrated in Figure 1) are coupled to<br>
and extend from a bushing frame (not shown) and provide upwardly directed<br>
forces for supporting the bushing assembly. To insulate the support straps 40<br>
and the bushing frame from electrical and thermal energy flowing through the<br>
main body 10, an electrically and thermally non-conductive bar 50 is provided<br>
between each support bracket 30 and corresponding support strap 40. Hence,<br>
each support strap 40 applies its upwardly directed holding force against a<br>
corresponding insulator block/support bracket combination.<br>
It is desirable for all bushing assembly nozzles to be positioned in generally the<br>
same horizontal plane. Typically, a plurality of cooling fins (not shown) are<br>
provided below the tip plate and extend between rows of the tip plate nozzles.<br>
Heat is radiantly and convectively transferred from the nozzles and the glass<br>
streams to the fins. If one or more first nozzles are repositioned closer to a<br>
corresponding fin, such as due to deformation of the tip plate, the heat transfer<br>
rate away from those first nozzles increases. An increase in the heat transfer rate<br>
away from a given nozzle results in a decrease in the glass flow rate through<br>
that nozzle. A reduction in glass flow rate through a nozzle results in a<br>
corresponding fiber being formed having a reduced diameter. Fibers formed<br>
having reduced diameters are more likely to break. Breakage of a single fiber<br>
during a fiber forming operation results in the operation failing and being<br>
shutdown. Consequently, operating costs are increased and productively is<br>
decreased.<br>
The bushing assembly illustrated in Figure 1 is typically formed from an alloy of<br>
platinum or a like material and is routinely operated at temperatures exceeding<br>
2200Â°F. At such high operating temperatures and after only a limited amount of<br>
time in production, one or more support brackets 30 either deform or separate<br>
from a corresponding support rail and main body side wall. Deformation or<br>
separation of a support bracket results in a portion of the perimeter of the<br>
bushing assembly main body being inadequately supported. This, in turn, can<br>
result in a portion of the tip plate being distorted. Tip plate distortion results in<br>
one or more nozzles being displaced from a nominal horizontal plane, in which all<br>
nozzles are initially positioned. As noted above, nozzle displacement can result in<br>
glass flow rate changes. Once a significant glass flow rate change has occurred<br>
at one or more nozzles, the bushing assembly must be replaced.<br>
The dimension from the tip plate outer surface to an inner bearing surface on a<br>
support bracket intermediate member 30c should be the same for each support<br>
bracket. If the support brackets are positioned relative to the tip plate<br>
inconsistently, installation of the bushing assembly within the bushing<br>
frame/support strap assembly becomes difficult and time consuming. This is<br>
because one or more support straps must be reconfigured or machined to<br>
compensate for the incorrectly positioned support brackets such that the bushing<br>
assembly tip plate is positioned in a generally horizontal plane. Because each<br>
support bracket is manually positioned and welded to its corresponding support<br>
rail and main body side wall, it is difficult to produce a bushing assembly having<br>
support brackets consistently positioned relative to the tip plate.<br>
It is desirable to have a bushing assembly/support structure arrangement where<br>
adequate support is provided for a bushing assembly main body over an<br>
extended period of time so as to increase the useful life of the bushing assembly.<br>
It is also desirable to have a bushing assembly/support structure arrangement<br>
where the bushing assembly can be easily installed within a bushing<br>
frame/support strap assembly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the present invention, an improved bushing assembly/support structure<br>
arrangement is provided. The bushing assembly comprises a bushing main body<br>
having, in one embodiment, first and second support rails fixedly coupled to<br>
opposing sides of the main body. Each support rail has first and second planar<br>
surfaces, which define a substantially L-shaped body. The support rails are<br>
accurately positioned vis-a-vis an outer surface of a tip plate. A first planar<br>
surface of each support rail is then fixedly coupled to a corresponding side wall<br>
of the main body. The bushing assembly further comprises a plurality of<br>
brackets. Each bracket comprises an intermediate member having a substantially<br>
planar face fixedly coupled along substantially its entire length to a<br>
corresponding main body side wall. Portions of each support rail extending<br>
between first and second leg members of a corresponding bracket function as<br>
bearing surfaces for corresponding support straps extending from a bushing<br>
frame. Because each support rail is fixedly coupled along substantially its entire<br>
length and each bracket is fixedly coupled along substantially the entire length of<br>
its intermediate member, each support strap contact region on the first and<br>
second support rails is robust and unlikely to distort or sag over extended<br>
periods of usage. Accordingly, the time period between bushing assembly<br>
changeovers is increased resulting in lower glass fiber production costs.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a bushing assembly is<br>
provided for containing a molten mineral material from which fibers can be<br>
attenuated. The bushing assembly comprises a bushing main body comprising at<br>
least first and second side walls and a tip plate extending between the side walls.<br>
The tip plate contains a plurality of orifices through which molten mineral<br>
material flows so as to be attenuated into fibers. The bushing assembly further<br>
comprises a first support rail coupled to the main body first side wall and at least<br>
one first bracket having an intermediate member coupled to the main body first<br>
side wall.<br>
The first support rail may comprise first and second substantially planar surfaces<br>
integral with one another and defining a L-shaped body. The support rail first<br>
planar surface may be coupled to the main body first side wall. It is also<br>
contemplated that the first support rail may be configured so as to define other<br>
shapes in cross section, such as, by not limited to, a square, a rectangle, or a<br>
triangle.<br>
The bracket may comprise first and second leg members and an intermediate<br>
member, with the legs members being located on opposing sides of the<br>
intermediate member and extending substantially orthogonal to the intermediate<br>
member.<br>
Preferably, the support rail includes first and second slots. The first and second<br>
bracket leg members are received in the first and second slots and may be<br>
weldably or otherwise coupled to the support rail and the main body first side<br>
wall.<br>
The bracket intermediate member is preferably welded to the main body first<br>
side wall along substantially the entire length of the intermediate member.<br>
The bushing assembly preferably comprises a plurality of first brackets, each of<br>
which includes an intermediate member weldably or otherwise coupled to the<br>
main body first side wall. The bushing assembly also preferably comprises a<br>
second support rail coupled to the main body second side wall. The second side<br>
wall is positioned opposite the first side wall. The bushing assembly also<br>
comprises a plurality of second brackets, each including an intermediate member<br>
weldably coupled to the main body second side wall.<br>
In accordance with a second aspect of the present invention, a bushing<br>
assembly/support structure arrangement is provided. The arrangement<br>
comprises a bushing assembly and a support structure. The bushing assembly<br>
includes a bushing main body comprising at least first and second side walls and<br>
a tip plate extending between the side walls. The tip plate contains a plurality of<br>
orifices through which molten mineral material flows prior to being attenuated<br>
into fibers. The bushing assembly further comprises a first support rail coupled to<br>
the main body first side wall, and at least one first bracket having an<br>
intermediate member coupled to the main body first side wall. The support<br>
structure comprises a bushing frame, and at least one first support strap. The<br>
support strap has a first end fixedly coupled to the bushing frame and second<br>
end extending toward a first location on the support rail adjacent the first<br>
bracket for supporting the bushing assembly.<br>
The arrangement further comprises an insulating member located between the<br>
support rail first location and the support strap second end. The support strap<br>
second end applies a weight-bearing support force against the support rail first<br>
location via the insulating member.<br>
The first support rail may comprise first and second substantially planar surfaces<br>
integral with one another and defining a L-shaped body. The support rail first<br>
planar surface is preferably coupled to the main body first side wall.<br>
The bracket may comprise first and second leg members. The legs members are<br>
located on opposing sides of the intermediate member and extend substantially<br>
orthogonal to the intermediate member.<br>
The first location on the support rail is located between the first and second legs<br>
of the first bracket.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
OF THE INVENTION<br>
A bushing assembly/support structure arrangement 100 constructed in<br>
accordance with the present invention is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. The<br>
arrangement 100 comprises a bushing assembly 110 and a support structure<br>
200. The bushing assembly 110 includes a bushing main body 120 comprising<br>
first, second, third and fourth side walls 122a-122d and a tip plate 124 extending<br>
between the side walls 122a-122d, see also Figures 4-6. The main body 120 is<br>
positioned below a bushing block 300 which, in turn, is positioned beneath a<br>
conventional forehearth 310. A first stream of molten mineral material is received<br>
by the main body 120 from the forehearth 310. The forehearth 310 receives the<br>
molten mineral material from a melter (not shown). A delivery channel (not<br>
shown) may be located between the melter and the forehearth 310 to deliver the<br>
molten material from the melter to the forehearth 310. The forehearth 310 and<br>
bushing block 300 are conventional in construction and are formed from<br>
refractory materials. The mineral material preferably comprises glass but may<br>
also comprise basalt, or other fiberizable minerals or polymers.<br>
The tip plate 124 contains a plurality of nozzles 124a (also referred to herein as<br>
orifices) through which a plurality of second streams of molten mineral material<br>
are discharged, see Figures 2 and 3. The second streams of material are<br>
mechanically drawn to form continuous filaments 125 via a conventional winder<br>
device 400, see Figure 2. In the illustrated embodiment, the filaments 125 are<br>
gathered into a single continuous strand 125a after having received a protective<br>
coating or sizing composition from sizing applicator 410. The strand 125a is<br>
wound onto a rotating collet 402 of the winder device 400 to form a package<br>
125b.<br>
The bushing assembly 110 further comprises a first support rail 130 coupled to<br>
the main body first side wall 122a and a second support rail 132 coupled to the<br>
second side wall 122b, see Figures 4-6. The first support rail 130 comprises first<br>
and second substantially planar surfaces 130a and 130b, which are integral with<br>
one another and define a first L-shaped body 131. The second support rail 132<br>
comprises first and second substantially planar surfaces 132a and 132b, which<br>
are integral with one another and define a second L-shaped body 133. The<br>
height H1 of each first planar surface 130a, 132a may be from about 2.5 mm-13<br>
mm (0.1 inch to about 0.5 inch) and is preferably about 5 mm (0.2 inch), see<br>
Figure 6. The height H2 of each second planar surface 130b, 132b may be from<br>
about 6.3 mm-119 mm (0.25 inch to 0.75 inch) and is preferably about 10 mm<br>
(0.4 inch), see Figure 6. It is further contemplated that the first and second<br>
support rails 130 and 132 may be configured so as to be rectangular, square,<br>
triangular, elliptical in shape or have another geometric shaped cross section.<br>
The first planar surface 130a of the first support rail 130 is fixedly coupled to the<br>
first side wall 122a, such as by welding the first surface 130a to the first side wall<br>
122a along substantially the entire length of the first surface 130a. Likewise, the<br>
first planar surface 132a of the second support rail 132 is fixedly coupled to the<br>
second side wall 122b, such as by welding the first surface 132a to the second<br>
side wall 122b along substantially the entire length of the first surface 132a. Prior<br>
to welding the first and second support rails 130 and 132 to the first and second<br>
side walls 122a and 122b, the support rails 130 and 132 are carefully positioned<br>
relative to the tip plate 124 such that a distance D from an outer surface 124b of<br>
the tip plate 124 to a lower edge 130c, 132c of each support rail 130, 132 is<br>
substantially constant along the entire length of the support rail 130, 132, see<br>
Figures 4-6. It is also contemplated that the first planar surfaces 130a and 132a<br>
of the first and second support rails 130 and 132 may alternatively be coupled to<br>
the side walls 122a and 122b at discrete, spaced-apart locations along the<br>
lengths of the planar surfaces 130a and 132a.<br>
The bushing assembly 110 also comprises a plurality of first brackets 140a (four<br>
in the illustrated embodiment) coupled to the first support rail 130 and the main<br>
body first side wall 122a, see Figures 3, 5 and 6, and a plurality of second<br>
brackets 140b (four in the illustrated embodiment) coupled to the second<br>
support rail 132 and the main body second side wall 122b, see Figures 3, and 4.<br>
Each bracket 140a, 140b includes first and second leg members 140c and 140d<br>
and an intermediate member 140e. The legs members 140c and 140d are<br>
located on opposing sides of the intermediate member 140e and extend<br>
substantially orthogonal to the intermediate member, see Figures 4-6. The<br>
intermediate member 140e of each bracket 140a, 140b is preferably weldably<br>
coupled to its corresponding main body side wall 122a, 122b along substantially<br>
the entire length of the intermediate member 140e. The intermediate member<br>
140e of each bracket 140a, 140b may have a length LB of from about 19 mm-<br>
63.5 mm (0.75 inch to 2.5 inches) and preferably about 38 mm (1.5 inches) and<br>
a height HB of from about 2.5 mm-13 mm (0.1 inch to about 0.5 inch) and is<br>
preferably about 6.3 mm (0.25 inch), see Figures 4 and 5.<br>
Each support rail 130 and 132 includes four sets of first and second slots 133a<br>
and 133b, see Figure 5. The first and second leg members 140c and 140d of<br>
each bracket 140a, 140b are received respectively in the first and second slots<br>
133a and 133b of the bracket"s corresponding support rail 130, 132. The leg<br>
members 140c and 140d are then weldably or otherwise fixedly coupled to the<br>
bracket"s corresponding support rail 130, 132 and the main body side wall 122a,<br>
122b so as to form a rigid support entity 135, see Figures 4-6.<br>
The support structure 200 comprises a bushing frame 210, which is supported by<br>
conventional metal frame apparatus 212, see Figure 3. The support structure<br>
200 further comprises a plurality of first support straps 220 (four in the<br>
illustrated embodiment) and a plurality of second support straps 222 (four in the<br>
illustrated embodiment). Each first support strap 220 has a first end 220a fixedly<br>
coupled to the bushing frame 210 by bolts 230, and a second end 220b<br>
extending toward a corresponding first location 130d on the first support rail<br>
130, see Figures 5 and 6. The first location 130d is positioned between the leg<br>
members 140c and 140d of a corresponding first bracket 140a. Each second<br>
support strap 222 has a first end 222a fixedly coupled to the bushing frame 210<br>
by bolts 230, and a second end 222b extending toward a corresponding second<br>
location 132d on the second support rail 132, see Figure 4. The second location<br>
132d is positioned between the leg members 140c and 140d of a corresponding<br>
second bracket 140b.<br>
The arrangement 200 further comprises a plurality of first insulating members<br>
250 (four in the illustrated embodiment) and a plurality of second insulating<br>
member 252 (four in the illustrated embodiment). Each first insulating member<br>
250 is located between a corresponding first support rail first location 130d and a<br>
corresponding first support strap second end 220b, while each second insulating<br>
member 252 is located between a corresponding second support rail second<br>
location 132d and a corresponding second support strap second end 222b. Each<br>
first support strap second end 220b applies a weight-bearing support force<br>
against a corresponding support rail first location 130d via a corresponding first<br>
insulating member 250. Each second support strap second end 222b applies a<br>
weight-bearing support force against a corresponding support rail second<br>
location 132d via a corresponding second insulating member 252. Hence, each<br>
support strap 220 and 222 applies an upwardly directed holding force against a<br>
corresponding insulating member/support rail combination.<br>
The first and second insulating members 250 and 252 are formed from an<br>
electrically and thermally non-conductive material, such as a mullite refractory,<br>
one of which is commercially available from L. H. Marshall Co. (Columbus, Ohio)<br>
under the product designation "MV-30 Mullite Bars". The members 250 and 252<br>
function to insulate a corresponding support strap 220 and 222 and the bushing<br>
frame 210 from electrical and thermal energy flowing through the main body<br>
120.<br>
As is apparent from Figures 4-6, portions of each support rail 130, 132, that is,<br>
the first and second support rail locations 130d, 132d, extending between the leg<br>
members 140c and 140d of a corresponding bracket 140a, 140b function as<br>
bearing surfaces for corresponding support straps 220, 222 extending from the<br>
bushing frame 210. Because each support rail 130,132 is fixedly coupled to the<br>
main body 120 along substantially its entire length and each bracket 140a, 140b<br>
is fixedly coupled along substantially the entire length of its intermediate<br>
member 140e, each first and second support rail location 130d, 132d is robust<br>
and unlikely to distort, sag or creep over extended periods of usage. Accordingly,<br>
the time period between bushing assembly changeovers is increased resulting in<br>
lower glass fiber production costs.<br>
While a certain representative embodiment and details have been shown for<br>
purposes of illustrating the invention, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
that various changes in the methods and apparatus disclosed herein may be<br>
made without departing from the scope of the invention, which is defined in the<br>
appended claims. For example, the second ends 220b and 222b of the support<br>
straps 220 and 222 may directly contact the support rail first and second<br>
locations 130d and 132d. In such an embodiment, the support straps 220 and<br>
222 may be coated with a ceramic material sufficient to provide adequate<br>
electrical and thermal insulation for the straps 220, 222 and the bushing frame<br>
210 or the straps 220, 222 may be made from an electrically and thermally non-<br>
conductive material.<br>
