				<td>GATHERING RANDOMNESS IN A WIRELESS SMART CARD READER<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
(0001]         In general, wireless communication is insecure and vulnerable to attacks.<br>
Various techniques may be employed to secure a wireless communication link or to make it<br>
less vulnerable to attacks.    For example, cryptographic techniques may be employed to<br>
secure a wireless communication link.   The strength of an encrypted communication link<br>
depends on the quality of the cryptographic keys, which in turn, depends, at least in part, on<br>
the randomness of the keys. It is known to have a device maintain a randomness pool, i.e. a<br>
"pool" of random data, from which the device can extract random data.   The extracted<br>
10   random data may be used in the generation of cryptographic keys.<br>
[0002] US 2004/188519 discloses a biometric device which interacts with a smart card, but it does not disclose a randomness pool on the smart card reader, nor is it concerned with the generation of keys. There is also no discussion in this reference about how to use a randomness pool to secure a communication between the smart card reader and another 15 device.<br>
[0003] US 2004/109567 discloses a system for generating an encryption key in an embedded device, such as a device embedded in a printer, but is not concerned with smart cards or smart card readers.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0004] In a main aspect, the present invention provides a system comprising: a smart card reader having a randomness pool; and a device comprising a source of random data, the device having installed thereon a driver for the smart card reader, wherein the driver is arranged to extract random data from the source and to send the extracted random data securely over a wireless communication link to the smart card reader, and the smart card reader is arranged to incorporate the extracted random data into the randomness pool.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0005] Embodiments of the invention are illustrated by way of example and not limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings, in which like reference numerals indicate corresponding, analogous or similar elements, and in which:<br>
[0006]         Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary system; and [0007]        Figure 2 is a block diagram of the exemplary system of Figure 1.<br>
[0008] It will be appreciated that for simplicity and clarity of illustration, elements shown in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
|0009] In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of embodiments of the invention. However it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments of the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments of the invention.<br>
[0010] Reference is made to Figure 1, which is a schematic diagram of an exemplary system, according to some embodiments of the invention. A system 100 includes a wireless smart card reader 102, a mobile device 104 and a wireless-enabled personal computer 106. Smart card reader 102 and mobile device 104 are able to communicate over a wireless communication link 108. Smart card reader 102 and personal computer 106 are able to communicate over a wireless communication link 110. A non-exhaustive list of examples of wireless local area network standards for wireless communication links 108 and 1 10 includes the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) for Wireless LAN MAC and Physical layer (PHY) 802.11 a, b, g and n specifications or future related standards, the Bluetooth® standard, the Zigbee™ standard and the like.<br>
[0011] A smart card 112 is shown inserted into smart card reader 102. Smart cards are personalized security devices, defined by the ISO7816 standard and its derivatives, as published by the International Organization for Standardization. A smart card may have a form factor of a credit card and may include a semiconductor device. The semiconductor device may include a memory that can be programmed with security information (e.g., a private decryption key, a private signing key, biometrics, etc.) and may include a processor and/or dedicated logic, for example, dedicated decryption logic and/or dedicated signing logic. A smart card may include a connector for powering the semiconductor device and performing serial communication with an external device. Alternatively, smart card functionality may be embedded in a device having a different form factor and different communication protocol, for example a Universal Serial Bus (USB) device. The person whose security information is stored on smart card 112 may use smart card reader 102 for identification, to unlock mobile device 104 and/or personal computer 106, and to digitally sign and/or decrypt messages sent by mobile device 104 and/or personal computer 106. Smart card 112 may also include a random number generator.<br>
[0012] For example, mobile device 104 may be able to send and receive e-mail messages via an e-mail server (not shown). If, for example, the Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) protocol is used, e-mail messages received at mobile device 104 are encrypted using a symmetric algorithm with a random message key generated by the sender of the e-mail message. The e-mail message also includes the message key, encrypted using the public key of the recipient. Upon receipt of an encrypted e-mail message, mobile device 104 may extract the encrypted message key and send it to smart card reader 102 via communication link 108. Smart card reader 102 may send the encrypted message key to smart card 112, and the decryption engine of smart card 112 may decrypt the encrypted message key using the recipient's private decryption key, which is stored in smart card 112. Smart card reader 102 may retrieve the decrypted message key from smart card 112 and forward it to mobile device 104 via communication link 108 so that mobile device 104 can decrypt the received e-mail message. The smart card 112 may prevent unauthorized use of the recipient's private decryption key by requiring that a password or personal identification number (PIN) be supplied before allowing the decryption operation to proceed.<br>
[0013] Similarly, to add a digital signature to an e-mail message being sent by mobile device 104, mobile device 104 may send a hash of the contents of the e-mail message to smart card reader 102 over communication link 108. Smart card reader 102 may pass the hash to smart card 112, which may produce a digital signature from the hash and the sender's private signing key, which is stored in smart card 112. Smart card 112 may then pass the digital signature to smart card reader 102, which may forward it to mobile device 104 via communication link 108 so that mobile device 104 can transmit it along with the e-mail message to the e-mail server. Again, smart card 112 may prevent unauthorized use of the recipient's private signing key by requiring that a password or PIN be supplied before allowing the signing operation to proceed.<br>
[0014] The unencrypted message key should be sent securely over communication link 108 from smart card reader 102 to mobile device 104 to prevent a third party from retrieving the message key from communication link 108. Similarly, the hash to be signed should be sent authentically over communication link 108 from smart card reader 102 to mobile device 104 to prevent a third party from modifying the hash and thereby causing smart card 112 to produce a signature using a hash different from the hash of the intended<br><br>
message. Therefore communication link 108 may need to be secured using cryptographic techniques.<br>
|0015] The person whose security information is stored on smart card 112 may wish to digitally sign outgoing e-mail sent from personal computer 106 or to decrypt incoming encrypted e-mail received at personal computer 106. This will require personal computer 106 to communicate with smart card reader 102 in much the same way as mobile device 104 communicates with smart card reader 102 as described above. For this purpose, or for other security-related measures (e.g. to permit the person to use personal computer 106), communication link 1 10 may need to be secured using cryptographic techniques.<br>
[0016] To secure communication links 108 and 1 10, smart card reader 102 may need to generate various cryptographic keys. For example, if communication links 108 and 110 are Bluetooth® communication links, then a relatively short (up to 16-digits) key may be used for the Bluetooth® pairing procedure. An additional layer of security for communication links 108 and 110 may involve encryption with one or more additional keys. These additional keys may be generated from a shared secret between smart card reader 102 and mobile device 104, or smart card reader 102 and personal computer 106, and one or more symmetric keys based on this shared secret may be generated using known Diffie-Hellman and simple password exponential key exchange (SPEKE) methods and variants thereof. Moreover, random session keys may be generated for each individual communication session over communication link 108 or 110.<br>
[0017] The strength of the encrypted channels between smart card reader 102 and mobile device 104 and personal computer 106 may depend, at least in part, on the quality of the encryption keys. The more random the data used to generate these keys, the less likely that an attacker will be able to figure out the keys, and the more secure the communication link.<br>
[0018] Smart card reader 102 may therefore maintain a "randomness pool", also known as a "random pool" or an "entropy pool". A randomness pool is a "pool" of random data, which is "stirred" as input is incorporated into the pool, to ensure that there is no discernible pattern. Many different implementations of randomness pools and corresponding pseudo-random number generators are known.<br>
[0019] For example, smart card reader 102 may store a 256-byte (2048-bit) long array, which is a list of all numbers from 0 to 255. A function may be used to permute the list based on input. A non-exhaustive list of examples for the function includes techniques of the RC41M encryption algorithm (also known as ARCFOUR), hashing functions and the like. In another example, smart card reader 102 may implement a pseudo-random number generator based on the Yarrow pseudo-random number generator described in J. Kelsey, B. Schneier and N. Ferguson, "Yarrow-160: Notes on the Design and Analysis of the Yarrow Cryptographic Pseudorandom Number Generator", Sixth Annual Workshop on Selected Areas in Cryptography (Springer Verlag, August 1999).<br>
[0020) The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples for methods to gather randomness for smart card reader 102. Any of these methods, or any combination of these methods, may be used.<br>
[0021] (1) Randomness injected at manufacturing. A source of randomness at the manufacturing facility may be used to generate a random value to add to the randomness pool of smart card reader 102. For example, the source of randomness may be a pseudorandom number generator. Although an attacker may know the algorithm used by the pseudo-random number generator, the attacker does not know which value was used to seed the pseudo-random number generator and is unaware of the conditions and circumstances at the time the random value was added to the randomness pool of smart card reader 102.<br>
[0022] (2) Random data injected to the smart card reader via an out-of-band communication link. Smart card reader 102 may include a connector, for example, a connector that accepts a USB cable. Smart card reader 102 may be connectable to personal computer 106 using a USB cable 114, for example, in order to charge a battery of smart card reader 102 and/or to upload software to smart card reader 102. The USB cable is an example of an out-of-band communication link, since it is authentic and secure and not vulnerable to attackers attempting to attack communication link 110. Personal computer 106 may include a randomness pool and may be able to provide smart card reader 102 with random data via the out-of-band communication link, and smart card reader 102 may then incorporate the random data into its randomness pool. Similarly, smart card reader 102 may be connectable to mobile device 104 via an out-of-band communication link, for example, a USB cable. Mobile device 104 may include a randomness pool and may be able<br>
to provide smart card reader 102 with random data via the out-of-band communication link, and smart card reader 102 may then incorporate the random data into its randomness pool.<br>
[0023] (3) Secure transmission of random data over a wireless communication link to the smart card reader. Mobile device 104 may have a smart card reader driver installed thereon. Mobile device 104 may have a source of random data. The smart card reader driver installed on mobile device 104 may extract random data from the source of random data in mobile device 104, and may send the extracted random data securely to smart card reader 102 over communication link 108. Smart card reader 102 may incorporate the extracted random data received securely over communication link 108 into its own randomness pool. Similarly, personal computer 106 may have a smart card reader driver installed thereon. Personal computer 106 may have a source of random data. The smart card reader driver installed on personal computer 106 may extract random data from the source of random data in personal computer 106, and may send the extracted random data securely to smart card reader 102 over communication link 110. Smart card reader 102 may incorporate the extracted random data received securely over communication link 110 into its own randomness pool. This method may be performed periodically.<br>
[0024] (4) Traffic received from the smart card is incorporated into the smart card reader's randomness pool. Smart card reader 102 may incorporate traffic received from smart card 112 into its randomness pool. Although some of the data stored on smart card 1 12 may not be random (e.g. biometrics, a person's name and other identification), the order in which this data is requested by smart card reader 102 may be unpredictable. Random elements may be included in some of the traffic received from smart card 112 by smart card reader 102, for example, the decrypted message key for an S/MIME e-mail message received at mobile device 102 or personal computer 106, and the digital signature produced by smart card 112 from the hash of the contents of an e-mail message and the e-mail sender's private signing key.<br>
[0025] (5) Random data from a random number generator of a smart card inserted in the smart card reader is incorporated into the smart card reader's randomness pool. Smart card 112 may have a random number generator. A device having a driver for smart card reader 102 installed thereon, such as mobile device 102 or personal computer 106, may request random data from smart card 112 via smart card reader 102. Since this random data is traffic received by smart card reader 102 from smart card 1 12,<br>
then if smart card reader 102 implements method (4) above of incorporating traffic received from smart card 112 in its randomness pool, this random data generated by the random number generator of smart card 112 will be incorporated into the randomness pool of smart card reader 102.<br>
[0026] (6) Incorporating into the randomness pool of the smart card reader a random session key generated by another device that is used to encrypt traffic between the device and the smart card reader. Mobile device 102 or personal computer 106 may generate a random session key and use it to encrypt traffic to smart card reader 102 over communication link 108 or 110, respectively. Smart card reader 102 may incorporate the random session key into its randomness pool.<br>

[0028| Smart card reader 102, mobile device 104 and personal computer 106 include antennae 202, 212, and 222, respectively. A non-exhaustive list of examples for antennae 202, 212 and 222 includes dipole antennae, monopole antennae, multilayer ceramic antennae, planar inverted-F antennae, loop antennae, shot antennae, dual antennae, omnidirectional antennae and any other suitable antennae.<br>
[0029] Smart card reader 102, mobile device 104 and personal computer 106 include communication interfaces 204, 214, and 224, respectively, which are coupled to antennae 202, 212, and 222, respectively. A non-exhaustive list of examples for standards with which communication interfaces 204, 214 and 224 may be compatible includes 802.11 a, b, g and n and future related standards, the Bluetooth® standard, the Zigbee™ standard and the like.<br>
[0030] Smart card reader 102 also includes a processor 206 coupled to communication interface 204, and a memory 208, which may be fixed in or removable from smart card reader 102. Memory 208 may be coupled to processor 206 or partly embedded in processor 206. Communication interface 204 and processor 206 may be part of the same integrated circuit or in separate integrated circuits. Similarly, processor 206 and memory 208 may be part of the same integrated circuit or in separate integrated circuits.<br>
[0031] Mobile device 104 also includes a processor 216 coupled to communication interface 214, and a memory 218, which may be fixed in or removable from mobile device 104. Memory 218 may be coupled to processor 216 or partly embedded in processor 216. Communication interface 214 and processor 216 may be part of the same integrated circuit or in separate integrated circuits. Similarly, processor 216 and memory 218 may be part of the same integrated circuit or in separate integrated circuits.<br>
[0032] Personal computer 106 also includes a processor 226 coupled to communication interface 224, and a memory 228, which may be fixed in or removable from personal computer 106. Memory 228 may be coupled to processor 226 or partly embedded in processor 226. Communication interface 224 and processor 226 may be part of the same integrated circuit or in separate integrated circuits. Similarly, processor 226 and memory 228 may be part of the same integrated circuit or in separate integrated circuits.<br>

Furthermore, processors 206, 216 and 226 may be part of an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) or may be a part of an application specific standard product (ASSP).<br>
