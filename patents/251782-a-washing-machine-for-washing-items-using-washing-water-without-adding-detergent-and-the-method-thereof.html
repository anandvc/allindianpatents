AN IMPORVED WASHING MACHINE FOR WASHING ITEMS<br>
USING WASHING WATER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a washing condition for washing machine. More<br>
specifically, this invention relates to a washing method and a washing machine, through<br>
which the efficient: detergeney ratio can been ensured even without adding any<br>
detergent.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Presently, users have to add a large quantity of washing powder into their washing<br>
machines when washing the laundry. Nevertheless, washing powder left on the laundry<br>
may irritate the skin of human body. More than that, the non-degradable detergent<br>
contained in discharging water will cause environmental pollution.<br>
In recent years, washing machine that takes advantage of eleelrolyzed water for<br>
washing or sterilization and disinfection has come into being. In the circumstance of<br>
washing without detergent, users have to intensify the electrolytic efficiency to produce<br>
strong alkaline water with a relatively high PH so as to enhance washing efficiency.<br>
Unfortunately the strongly alkaline water brings more intense causticity to laundry,<br>
though it seems to make them much cleaner.<br>
References relate to washing process with the assistance of electrolytic ionized<br>
water, auxiliary modifying agent, or even use a drastically reduced amount of a<br>
detergent or w ithout the use of a detergent are listed as below:<br>
A washing machine equipped with a water ionizing device was disclosed in<br>
CN9924X529. in which, an outlet pipe for positive ionized water and an outlet pipe for<br>
negative ionized water with valves is connected with each side of the water ionizing<br>
device respectively, and both the outlet pipes are linked to the washing tub to supply for<br>
lessening pollution and saving water.<br>
CNOOH0127 disclosed an electrochemical washing machine and electrochemical<br>
detergent by which the water will be softened, greasy stains are emulsified and<br>
decomposed, color stains are bleached out, sterilization and disinfection is achieved,<br>
and re-adhesion of washed-off dirt on the laundry is prevented by electrophoresis and<br>
electrolysis. In addition, washing process under the softening or sizing procedure will<br>
be more time and money-saving. The specific electrochemical detergent is<br>
comparatively low in manufacturing cost, has less pollution to the environment for less<br>
dosage.<br>
CN01139901 disclosed a water-purifying system for household use, and a washing<br>
machine thereof. The hardening components, organic substances and contaminants can<br>
be separated and removed from the washing water by this system.<br><br>
CN02106217 disclosed an electric washing machine, in which the laundry is<br>
washed by electrolyzed water, in particular, air is supplied into the electrolyzing cell to<br>
generate water streams in order to improve the electrolytic efficiency during electrolysis,<br>
and the washing performance can be improved by electrolyzed water.<br>
CN99800057 disclosed a washing process and washing device. Specifically, a<br>
washing process washes items to be washed simultaneously with softening washing<br>
water comprising alkali metal ion and at least one of carbonate ion and bicarbonate ion.<br>
The washing water before being softened is obtained by electrolyzing an aqueous<br>
solution of sodium hydrogencarbonate having a pH of 9.5 or more and an electric<br>
conductivity of 150mS/m or more. The softened washing water has a total hardness of<br>
40ppm or less. However, in this process or device, an electrolyte is required to be added.<br>
and the influence of hardness described in it is not an essential item for the inventors'<br>
experiments of this invention.<br>
CN96243576.7 disclosed an electrolytic device, comprising a housing, a filter.<br>
electrolyzing cell, AC/DC power supply converter, control buttons, "prompt " switch.<br>
wastewater tank, control circuit etc. This electrolytic device is a dual-purpose<br>
consecutive electrolyzing water supplying device, which can either connect with tap<br>
water tube directly, or can be used with its water storage tank in the absence of tap water<br>
tube.<br>
CN99211396.2 disclosed a washing machine capable of killing off viruses and<br>
germs on the clothes and other washing items. A DC electrolytic device and a DC<br>
regulated power supply inside the housing of current washing machine. The DC<br>
Voltage-stabilized source is linked to the power of the washing machine, so that the DC<br>
Voltage-stabilized source provides direct current to support the DC electrolytic device<br>
as washing machine is working. Water flowing into the DC electrolytic device through<br>
inlet tube of washing machine, chlorine ion contained in water is electrolyzed, and<br>
hypochlorous acid (HCIO) is produced in the water, afterwards kills the viruses and<br>
germs on the laundry in washing machine. This device not only achieves an excellent<br>
washing result, but also enjoys a low cost attributed to its simple structure.<br>
Regarding the electrolytic device performing electrolysis on the water-supply path, a<br>
power supply board with large power should be taken to ensure the electrolytic<br>
efficiency, but it may lead to heat of the board.<br>
Electrolyzed water is sometimes applied for washing, sterilizing and disinfecting<br>
purpose in recent years. One way is to install electrolytic device onto the inside wall of<br>
the outer tub, as disclosed in the electric washing machine of CN02106218.8 in which<br>
electrolytic device is placed onto the inside wall of the outer tub, but its disadvantage is:<br>
the outer tub will sway and vibrate along with the rotating of water streams in the<br>
washing course, and as a result, the electrolytic device projecting forward is likely to be<br><br>
damaged.<br>
It is known from the above prior art that the electrolyzed water generating devices<br>
are ail arranged on the outer tub of washing machine's housing. Nevertheless, noticing<br>
the emergence of customers' new consuming conception nowadays, namely, pursuing<br>
lighter, thinner, smaller, and multi-functional products, the inventor of this invention<br>
have realized that if the electrolyzed water generating means are put between outer tub<br>
and housing, the applicable space left for washing machine shall be smaller; still worse,<br>
it will also place the wiring design under a condition of embarrassment. So, to develop a<br>
new washing machine that can make full use of the applicable place, and to satisfy all<br>
the requirements mentioned above, is the main problem that the inventors of this<br>
invention seek to solve urgently.<br>
Furthermore, it is unrealistic to add electrolyzed water generating means and<br>
modifying agent-feeding device on the double driven washing machine of the prior art.<br>
The reason is that in order to achieve the goal, designers need to re-disassemble the<br>
washing machine, re-design the wiring, and arrange electrolytic device and modifying<br>
agent feeding device inside the washing machine, which undoubtedly, will take too<br>
much time, consume too much recourses, bring about too much manufacturing costs<br>
and other defects, so it may be impossible to retrofit the existing washing machines.<br>
Hence, when seeking to solve the first technical problem, the inventors of this invention<br>
take into account of the second technological problem to provide a simple and<br>
convenient washing machine without addition of a detergent by the users during<br>
washing process.<br>
Making use of electrolysis method according to the prior art to wash clothes<br>
usually has the following disadvantages , particularly when it is asserted washing<br>
without the use of a detergent: (1) Electrolyte, e.g. sodium chloride and other activators,<br>
is put into washing water to enhance the electrolytic efficiency. Though the electrolytic<br>
efficiency is improved by adding the electrolyte, the subsequent change in water quality<br>
will probably result in fabric hardening; moreover, electrolyte has to be added by the<br>
user of washing machine manually, otherwise, the washing effects shall be barely<br>
satisfactory. (2) Bubbles are introduced into washing water to upgrade the detergency<br>
ratio. Apparently, it will make the mechanism more complex and increase the cost; (3)<br>
Some references suggest two times washing operation (re-washing process), but as a<br>
matter of fact, it implies that washing time shall be prolonged.<br>
Furthermore, according to the references disclosed in the prior art, no definite<br>
direction, objective and process of research should be followed on to obtain the best<br>
washing effects and conditions for washing machines. Thus, the inventor of this<br>
invention study the washing conditions and device to solve the technical defects and<br>
disadvantages discussed above, and finally succeeded in finding out the way to attain<br><br>
the best washing effects on the appropriate washing conditions, thanks to their persistent<br>
efforts of countless experiments and testing.<br>
In view of that, this invention has been put forward to overcome the disadvantages<br>
aforesaid.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
With a view of the above-mentioned disadvantages, it is an object of the present<br>
invention to provide a washing method to obtain best washing conditions by make use<br>
of electrolyzed water, and users of washing machine may add a drastically reduced<br>
amount of a detergent (or other auxiliary agents), or even without addition of any<br>
detergent.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide an auxiliary device of<br>
washing machine, which is simple in structure and convenient for installation without<br>
altering the internal structure of current washing machine by hanging and mounting the<br>
auxiliary device on the housing, so that the existing washing machine will be retrofitted<br>
or otherwise utilized to be a washing machine which has no need of adding detergent by<br>
the users.<br>
It is yet another object of this invention to provide a washing machine equipped<br>
with a new washing auxiliary device simple in structure and convenient for installation,<br>
and the users do not need to add detergent during washing.<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that the influence of hardness of<br>
washing liquid on detergency is mainly due to its influence on the chemical structure of<br>
detergent, and the reaction between detergent molecules and contaminant molecules.<br>
However, under the washing conditions of the present invention, this influence hardly<br>
exists, so we infer that the hardness of water will not have any practical negative effect<br>
on detergency. Although inventors of the present invention think water hardness has no<br>
dominating influence on detergency ratio under the washing conditions of the present<br>
invention, the testing results showed that under the washing conditions of this invention,<br>
it is preferable to keep the hardness of washing liquid in a range from 5 to 400ppm,<br>
which could be achieved by the electrolyzing process and addition of modifying agent.<br>
In accordance with the first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a washing<br>
method comprising electrolyzing tap water, or adding a certain dosage of modifying<br>
agent at the same time, The PH of electrolyzed water is maintained in the range from<br>
8.5 to 11. The electric conductivity of washing water after electrolysis, including<br>
modifying agent possibly added, is from 261 us/cm to 875us/cm, while the surface<br>
tension is from 25 to 40 mN/m. The washing water used in the process of this invention<br>
is electrolyzed water or the mixture of electrolyzed water and modifying agent added.<br>
Water temperature of washing is in the range from 5°C to 50°C, preferably fiom 10°Cto<br><br>
30°C.<br>
The PH is preferable from 9.0 to 11, or more preferably 9.8.<br>
The detergency ratio of the washing process is in a range from 0.1 to 0.5 tested<br>
according to GB4288.<br>
In case the pH of washing liquid is lower than 8.5. a proper dosage of washing<br>
powder shall be put into the electrolyzed water, yet the dosage of washing powder shall<br>
not be larger than 0.2% on the basis of the washing water.<br>
As the analysis on current technology indicates, washing conditions are really<br>
complicated, so the change of a single factor barely meets the requirements in modern<br>
washing. No matter it is a selective invention, or an innovative invention, the most<br>
important contribution of this invention consists in controlling a lot of different factors<br>
within a certain scope, and enabling the comprehensive index of the washing liquid<br>
within this scope to stay at a standard level from the beginning of washing to the end.<br>
The tap water supplied into the electrolyzing cell is electrolyzed to get acidic ionized<br>
water and alkaline ionized water respectively. The latter is supplied into the washing tub,<br>
where the water temperature and PH reach the predetermined values, and the alkaline<br>
ionized water comes to the predetermined water level, it is activated by the modifying<br>
agent fed by the modifying agent supply device, and then, normal washing course is<br>
performed.<br>
The washing method comprises the steps of: tap water is supplied to the<br>
electrolyzing cell to be electrolyzed, acidic ionized water and alkaline ionized water are<br>
generated respectively, and alkaline water is supplied into the washing tub, acidic<br>
ionized water is stored up, then the alkaline ionized water which is activated by the<br>
modifying agent fed by the modifying agent supply device reaches the washing water<br>
level, normal washing course starts; the rinsing operation is performed after water is<br>
supplied into the washing tub again, or a proper amount of acidic ionized water is<br>
introduced for rinsing the laundry, and some tap water is introduced to meet the<br>
predetermined water level to fulfill the entire washing process.<br>
The washing process comprises the steps of: tap water is supplied to the<br>
electrolyzing cell to be electrolyzed, acidic ionized water and alkaline ionized water are<br>
generated respectively, and alkaline water is supplied into the washing tub, acidic<br>
ionized water is discharged; then, modifying agent is added to the alkaline ionized water<br>
from modifying agent feeding device, and it will be activated accordingly. As the<br>
alkaline ionized water activated by the modifying agent fed by the modifying agent<br>
supply device reaches the predetermined water level, normal washing process starts.<br>
The rinsing operation is performed after water is supplied into the washing tub again-<br>
electrolytic polarity of the electrolyzing cell is changed to produce acidic ionized water<br>
and alkaline ionized water respectively, acidic ionized water is fed into the washing tub.<br><br>
alkaline ionized water is discharged, and some tap water is introduced to meet the<br>
predetermined water level to fulfill the entire rinsing operation.<br>
The washing process comprises the steps of: tap water is supplied to the<br>
electrolyzing cell to be electrolyzed, acidic ionized water and alkaline ionized water are<br>
generated respectively, and alkaline water is supplied into the washing tub, acidic<br>
ionized water is discharged; then, the alkaline ionized water shall be added with<br>
modifying agent through modifying agent feeding device, and it will be activated<br>
accordingly. Then the alkaline ionized water activated by the modifying agent fed by<br>
the modifying agent supply device reaches the predetermined water level normal<br>
washing process starts; the rinsing operation is performed after water is supplied into<br>
the washing tub again, electrolytic polarity of the electrolyzing cell is changed to<br>
produce acidic ionized water and alkaline ionized water respectively, acidic ionized<br>
water is fed into the washing tub to the predetermined water level to fulfill the entire<br>
rinsing operation, while alkaline ionized water is discharged.<br>

through the second drainpipe connecting to the water drainage tube.<br>
The electrolyzing cell of electrolyzed water generating device, and/or the liquid<br>
storage container of the modifying agent feeding device is hanged externally and<br>
mounted on the housing of washing machine. In a broader sense, it is acceptable to hang<br>
the electrolyzing cell and/or the liquid storage container externally and fixed up around<br>
the washing machine (i.e. on the front panel, at the left/right side, and the rear panel):<br>
however, considering the appearance of the washing machine, hanging externalfy on the<br>
front panel, at the left or the right side of washing machine will impose a negative effect<br>
on the visual image of the washing machine on a whole. What's more, since the<br>
impeller in washing machine always rotates clockwise or counter clockwise, so. when<br>
the impeller starts to rotate or ends rotating, its initial point or the ending point usually<br>
lies at the front or back of washing machine, and the high-speed rotating point often at<br>
the left or right side. It is well known that the rotation of washing machine starts with<br>
one acceleration, ending with another, therefore, only at the initial and the ending points<br>
will the rotary force has a minimum value. In other words, as the impeller is rotating.<br>
the front panel and the rear panel have a slighter impact from rotary force, comparing<br>
with the impact the left and right side endure resulting from rotary force. It is especially<br>
true when the housing is equipped with an electrolyzing cell and/or a liquid storage<br>
container, which has/have a certain weight. For the electrolyzing cell and/or liquid<br>
storage container themselves (itself) undergo(es) a downward gravity, if they (it) are (is)<br>
placed at the left or right side withstanding stronger impact by the rotary force, due to<br>
the impeller rotation, they (it) may affect the smooth rotation of impeller, fray the<br>
impeller axle, or sway the machine body. In this case, it is preferable to hang the<br>
electrolyzing cell and/or the liquid storage container externally and fix them (it) upon<br>
the lateral surface of the housing back of washing machine.<br>
The simplest fix-up method is often applied, namely, first, pegging the electrolyzing cell<br>
and/or liquid storage container on the lateral surface of the housing back of washing<br>
machine with bolts. Next, hooding a cover board onto the lateral surface of the above<br>
cell or container.<br>
It is suggested that the hanged thickness of the electrolyzing cell or liquid storage<br>
container shall be less than 1/4 of that of washing machine, preferably 1/10. Width and<br><br>
height of the electrolyzing cell or liquid storage container shall be less than that of the<br>
washing machine.<br>
The washing machine discussed here can be selected from the double-driven,<br>
impeller, agitator, or drum washing machine.<br>
The advantages of the present invention consist in the following aspects:<br>
This invention adjust the PH value of washing liquid to between 9 and 11, by<br>
virtue of modifying the electrolyzed tap water, and then conducts testing under different<br>
accessional procedures to master a number of experimental data. The method depicted<br>
in this invention helps to realize a washing without detergent, and makes it possible to<br>
reduce expenses and avoids environmental pollution brought about by the use of<br>
detergent otherwise. Meanwhile, the modification of washing water eradicates the<br>

disclosed in details in the series patent applications filed on November 2003 by the<br>
applicant of this invention, for example: application number: 200320121902.8, entitle:<br>
 Additive Supply Device; application number: 200320121903.2, entitle: Electrolyzed<br>
water Feeding Loop; application number: 200320121901.3, entitle: Washing Machine<br>
with Electrolytic Device; application number: 200310113629.9, entitle: Washing<br>
Machine and Washing Method, et al. All these reference are introduced in as<br>
background and prior art for technical details and will not be described in this invention.<br>
 During operation, water supply valve 21 is connected with the tap water tube. The three<br>
outlets of water supply valve are directly connected to the water supply path of washing<br>
tub. water inlet of the softener box and electrolyzed water inlet of electrolytic water<br>
generating device. The control programs are stored in the board computer for current<br>
washing course or washing program with electrolyzed water instead of washing powder.<br>
 If the user chooses a washing course without the use of washing powder, eiectroiytic<br>
water generating device starts to work. Tap water flux is controlled from 1.0 to lOL/min<br>
by water supply valve 21, preferably from 3.5 to 6.0L/min to ensure the efficiency of<br>
eiectroiytic process. Tap water is introduced into electrolyzing cell 31 to be electrolyzed<br>
therein. Alkaline water and acid water will be produced by the cathode and anode, and<br>
 is comparted by the diaphragm. Then alkaline water is introduced into the inner tub<br>
through to the first drainpipe 34 to wash clothes, at the same time the acid water will<br>
(low out through the second drainpipe 35 to sterilize the laundry. Because the ratio of<br>
cross-sectional area of flow passage for cathode chamber 3 31 against anode chamber<br>
3 12 of the said electrolytic chamber is 4:1, the flux of alkaline water is large than that of<br>
 acid water. That is, output flux ratio of alkaline water to acid water is controlled to be<br>
from 3:1 to 6:1 to reduce consumption of waste water, ensure electrolytic efficiency and<br>
achieve the proper PH of 9.8± 1.2.<br>
When the electrolytic water generating device works conversely, acid water is<br>
produced and flowed from the cathode chamber. Because of the predetermined ratio of<br>
 cross sectional area of cathode chamber 311 to anode chamber 312, the flow of alkaline<br>
water from the second drainpipe 35 to the washing tub is less than that of acid water<br>
from the first drainpipe 34, thus it is suitable for rinsing operation due to the function of<br>
sterilization and disinfection.<br><br>
Some washing machines or washing methods with no need of adding detergent, or<br>
even washing the laundry by using electrolyzed water directly, has been disclosed in the<br>
prior art including patent publication.<br>
But what has been brought forward in the prior art is only a concept of improving<br>
 the PH of water through electrolysis. Water with high PH has higher detergcncy ratio in<br>
clothes washing, which is also known in the prior art. However, as to what is the proper<br>
PH, by which a reasonable electrolysis cost and washing time may be obtained, and the<br>
washing operation does not damage to clothing materials, have not been disclosed in the<br>
prior art. In particularly, what is the standard referring to the so-called no need of<br>
 detergent? It does not mean anything without a comparison standard. In fact, washing<br>
with only tape water can achieve certain detergency ratio without specifically limitation<br>
of comparison condition; especially when the dirt is mainly ash, the detergency ratio<br>
may high.<br>
So, a comparison standard is introduced at first, that is, all national standard<br>
washing machine is utilized as part of test standard in the present invention. More<br>
specifically, the test method of washing performance is introduced and described in<br>
detail based on the above-mentioned standard. All the parameters to testify the<br>
nonobviousness of the present invention are obtained on the basis of this standard.<br>
This invention mainly makes comprehensive test on the washing effect (detergency<br>
ratio, PH, electrical conductivity, surface tension etc) achieved with different water<br>
quality (with or without washing powder) under conditions of defined water<br>
temperature, volume and the same washing process to obtain an washing method under<br>
optimum washing condition.<br>
Test procedure and Test condition of this invention are shown in Table ! and Table<br>
2, referring details in Table 1 and Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
The other conditions for the comparative test in Table 1 above include:<br>
(1)	Load of 5.2 Kg;<br>
(2)	Standard course is applied as the washing procedure;<br>
(3)	The experimental data shown is a range obtained from several tests under actual<br>
 water temperature in the range of 9.2°C-15.1°C:<br>
(4)	Double-driven washing machine is taken as the test model. (For the double driven<br>
washing machine refers to CN02110035, CN02110368 etc., and other references<br>
related to double driven washing machine disclosed by applicant of this invention<br>
is introduced as the background.)<br>
	It can be seen from the experiment data in the above Table, under the same<br>
temperature, the same volume capacity and with the same washing procedure, the<br>
detergency ratio will be 0.265, average PH will be 10.57, average surface tension will<br>
be 32mN/m and average electrical conductivity will be 261.5us/cm if electrolyzed water<br>
with water-environment improvement (hereinafter referred to as active electrolyzed<br>
 water) is employed for washing; the average detergency ratio will be 0.16. average PH<br>
will be 10.6, average surface tension' will be 66mN/m and average electrical<br>
conductivity will be 604.5us/cm if only electrolyzed water is employed: the average<br>
detergency ratio will be 0.2768, average PH will be 10.656, surface tension will be<br>
30mN/m and average electrical conductivity will be 283us/cm if electro!} zed water is<br>
 employed in combination with addition of 0.2% washing powder: the average<br>
detergency ratio will be 0.108, average PH will be 7.473, average surface tension will<br>
be 69mN/m and average electrical conductivity will be 222us/cm if tap water is<br>
employed; the average detergency ratio will be 0.2803, average PH will be 7.473.<br>
average surface tension will be 30mN/m and average electrical conductivity will be<br>
 222us/cm if tap water is combined with 0.2% washing powder.<br>
From the data above, it can be concluded that: comparing washing method by<br>
employing only electrolyzed water, or tap water added with washing powder with that<br>
by employing active electrolyzed water, or only electrolyzed water added with washing<br>
powder, the optimum washing condition without washing powder is that the average<br>
	detergency ratio is 0.265, average PH is 10.57, average surface tension is 32mN/m and<br>
the average electrical conductivity is in the range from 261 to 262us/cm.<br><br><br><br>
The other conditions for the comparative test in Table 2 above include:<br>
(1)	Load of 5.0 Kg;<br>
(2)	Standard course is applied as the washing procedure;<br>
(3)	The experimental data shown is a range obtained from several tests under actual<br>
water temperature in the range of 30°C-32°C;<br>
(4)	Double-driven washing machine is taken as the test model.<br>
It can be seen from the experiment data in the Table above that, under the same<br>
temperature, the same volume capacity and with the same washing procedure, the<br>
average detergency ratio will be 0.326, average PH will be 10.19, average surface<br>
tension will be 31mN/m and average electrical conductivity will be 575.5us/cm if<br>
Active electrolyzed water is employed for washing; the average cleaning rate will be<br>
0.36, average PH will be 10.158, average surface tension will be 67mN/m and average<br>
electrical conductivity will be 318us/cm if electrolyzed water added with 0.2% washing<br>
powder is employed; the detergency ratio rate will be 0.1949, average PH will be 7.547.<br>
average surface tension will be 70mN/m and average electrical conductivity will be'<br>
203us/cm if tap water is employed; the average detergency ratio will be 0.326. average<br>
PH will be 7.708, and average electrical conductivity will be 2!4us/cm if tap water<br>
added with 0.2% washing powder is employed.<br>
Comparing washing method by employing electrolyzed water or thai added with<br>
washing powder with the method by employing tap water or that added with washing<br>
powder, the optimum washing condition obtained without washing powder is that the<br>
average detergency ratio is 0.326, average PH is 10.19, average surface tension is about<br>
31mN/m, however, the average electrical conductivity is relatively high.<br>
From the data above, it can be seen that washing performance can be improved by<br>
adding washing powder into the electrolyzed water. PH when employing electrolyzed<br>
water is closer to the standard value of washing machine than that when employing tap<br>
water, moreover, the surface tension of the electrolyzed water is much lower tap water,<br>
hence better washing effect is obtained.<br>
In comprehensive consideration of the two Tables above, it can be concluded that,<br>
without considering capacity and whether washing powder is added, water temperature<br>
of 30QC is more preferable than 10°C under the same washing condition, and will thus<br><br>
achieve optimum washing result.<br>
Example 1<br>
The water temperature is predetermined at 10°C and capacity of 100%, washing<br>
operation is performed by employing active electrolyzcd water under standard course:<br>
During the process of washing: under actual water temperature of 9.2°C, the tap water<br>
flows into the electrolyzing cell, from which alkaline ionized water and acidic ionized<br>
water with steady PH are produced, the former will be used to regulate water quality by<br>
adding modifying agent and then enter into the washing tub after being activated,<br>
while the latter will be drained. PH in the tub at this moment reaches 10.57, which is the<br>
best value for washing, meanwhile, normal washing will begin when the alkaline<br>
ionized water inflow reaches the predetermined water level and terminate after<br>
conducting the standard course for fifteen minutes at least. The surface tension is<br>
31mN/m, electrical conductivity is 261 us/cm and detergency ratio is 0.2258. The<br>
activated alkaline ionized water with steady PH performs the same function as the<br>
washing powder; therefore, detergent is unnecessary for this method.<br>
Example 2<br>
The water temperature is predetermined at 10CC and capacity of 60%, washing<br>
operation is performed by employing electrolyzed water under standard course:<br>
Group 1, During washing under water temperature of 11.5°C, tap water is firstly<br>
electrolyzed in the electrolyzing cell in which alkaline ionized water and acidic ionized<br>
water with steady PH will be generated, the alkaline ionized water flows into the<br>
washing tub while the acidic ionized water will be stored. By adding certain dose of<br>
modifying agent, PH in the tub will be 10.405 that suitable for washing. After the<br>
alkaline ionized water is introduced to the set water level, washing is carried out for<br>
eight minutes, it is measured that the surface tension is 34mN/m, electrical conductivity<br>
is 486us/cm and detergency ratio is 0.2015. ft can be concluded from the experiment<br>
data in this group that: the electrical conductivity is relatively high. Furthermore, rinse<br>
ran be performed along with water inflow for the second time, when the stored acidic<br>
ionized water together with some tap water may be introduced into the washing tub to<br>
the predetermined level. In this embodiment, the water in the tub for rinsing is the acidic<br>
ionized water with certain concentration; laundry can be cleaned and sterilized while<br>
being rinsed.<br>
Group 2, During washing under water temperature of 9.7°C, tap water will be<br>
firstly electrolyzed in the electrolyzing cell in which alkaline ionized water and acidic<br>
ionized water with steady PH will be produced, the alkaline ionized water is introduced<br>
into the washing tub while the acidic ionized water will be stored. By adding certain<br>
quantity of modifying agent, PH in the tub will be 10.625 that suitable for washing.<br>
When the water level in the washing tub reaches a predetermined level, washing is<br><br>
carried out for twenty-five minutes, rinsing is performed for two times and the total<br>
washing period lasts for fifty-seven minutes. It can be eventually measured that the<br>
surface tension of washing water is 32mN/m, electrical conductivity is 273us/cm and<br>
detergcncy ratio is 0.255.<br>
It can be concluded from the experiment data in Group 1 and Group 2 that:<br>
washing efficiency will be improved along with the increase of washing duration when<br>
water temperature is decreased.<br>
Group 3, during washing under water temperature of 12.2°C, tap water will be<br>
firstly electrolyzed in the electrolyzing cell in which alkaline ionized water and acidic<br>
ionized water with steady PH will be produced, the alkaline ionized water is introduced<br>
into the washing tub while the acidic ionized water will be stored. PH in the tub will be<br>
10.468 after certain quantity of modifying agent is added. When the water level in the<br>
washing tub reaches a predetermined level, washing procedure for "jeans" with water<br>
level 10 and in standard course is chosen for washing a period of twenty-five minutes.<br>
The total washing period lasts for fifty-seven minutes. It can be measured that the<br>
surface tension of washing water is 30mN/m, electrical conductivity is 246us/cm and<br>
detergency ratio is 0.2586.<br>
Group 4. Water temperature is 12.2°C during washing operation. Tap water will be<br>
firstly electrolyzed in the electrolyzing cell in which alkaline ionized water and acidic<br>
ionized water with steady PH will be produced, the alkaline ionized water is introduced<br>
into the washing tub while the acidic ionized water will be stored. PH in the tub is<br>
10.468 after certain quantity of modifying, agent is added to soften the water. When the<br>
water level in the washing tub reaches a predetermined level, washing procedure for<br>
"jeans'" with water level 10 and in standard course is chosen for washing a period of<br>
twenty-five minutes, the first rinsing operation is performed by acidic ionized water.<br>
The total washing period lasts for fifty-seven minutes. It can be measured that the<br>
surface tension of washing water is 30mN/m, electrical conductivity is 273us/cm and<br>
detergency ratio is 0.27.<br>
It can be concluded from the experiment data in Group 3 and Group 4 that: along<br>
with increase of washing duration and enhancement of washing water inflow when<br>
water temperature is decreased, washing efficiency with acid water rinsing operation is<br>
better than that of simple washing procedure.<br>
Example 3<br>
Washing is performed at the water temperature of 30°C and capacity of 60% by<br>
employing electrolyzed water and with standard course .<br>
Group 5, during washing under water temperature of 39.0°C, tap water will be<br>
firstly electrolyzed in the electrolyzing cell in which alkaline ionized water and acidic<br>
ionized water with steady PH will be produced, the alkaline ionized water is introduced<br><br>
into the washing tub while the acidic ionized water will be stored. PH in the tub will be<br>
10.103 after the addition of certain quantity of modifying agent. When the water level in<br>
the washing tub reaches a predetermined level, washing is performed with washing<br>
water level 6 and rinsing water level 10 and in standard course for twenty-five minutes,<br>
and the total washing period lasts for fifty-seven minutes. It can be measured that the<br>
surface tension of washing water is 30mN/m, electrical conductivity is 57us/cm and<br>
detergency ratio is 0.3631.<br>

ionized water with steady PH will be produced, the alkaline ionized water is introduced<br>
into the washing tub while the acidic ionized water will be stored. PH in the tub is<br>
10.468 after a certain quantity of modifying agent is added to soften the water. When<br>
the water level in the washing tub reaches a predetermined level, washing is performed<br>
at standard course. It can be measured that the surface tension of washing water is<br>
33mN/m. electrical conductivity is 463us/cm and detergency ratio is 0.3402.<br>
It is shown from the experiment in Group 5 and Group 6 that: under water<br>
temperature of above 30°C, the higher the temperature, the higher the PH. the higher the<br>
detergency ratio will be.<br>
Modifying agent or modifying liquor in this invention refers to the liquid that is<br>
able to increase the surface activity and help to regulate the washing liquid to the<br>
defined washing condition described above, including factors such as surface tension.<br>
hardness, electrical conductivity etc, when washing, and it is not decomposed under<br>
