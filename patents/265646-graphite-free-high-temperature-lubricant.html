				<td>Graphite-free high-temperature lubricant<br>
The present invention concerns a high-temperature lubricant for the hot<br>
processing of metals.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the hot working of metals, in particular steel, in a temperature range of 700 -<br>
1300°C, scale formation occurs at the heated metal surface, at the ambient air. In the<br>
case of hot rolling methods for steel for the production of seamless tubes and pipes, a<br>
solid material is pierced and a hollow block formed, which is then elongated in<br>
subsequent rolling steps. Here the danger of scale formation on the heated metal<br>
surface of the hollow block during transfer to the elongation procedure is particularly<br>
high. In the subsequent rolling steps that occurrence of scale can lead to internal flaws<br>
in the seamless tube or pipe. For that reason the scale involved is blown off for<br>
example with compressed air or inert gas. In addition very widely differing substances<br>
in powder form are applied as lubricants or mordant agents to the inside surface of the<br>
hollow blocks. Examples of such lubricants or mordant agents contain graphite, boron<br>
nitride, molybdenum sulphide, silicates or alkaline earth phosphates and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
Many lubricants for the hot working of metals contain graphite by virtue of its<br>
good lubricating properties. It will be noted however that graphite suffers from<br>
considerable disadvantages such as for example the absorption of graphite carbon into<br>
the worked metal surface, whereby the composition and the properties of the metal<br>
surface can be altered. In addition graphite is undesirable for reasons relating to<br>
working hygiene as the graphite powder is easily atomised into the ambient atmosphere<br>
and represents a health risk by breathing in the graphite powder for people working in<br>
the vicinity.<br>
Furthermore by virtue of their physical properties and grain sizes many known<br>
lubricants do not have good trickle and flow characteristics. A coarse material<br>
involving large grain sizes frequently results in inadequate and irregular covering of the<br>
metal surface and thus poor scale reduction. Known fine-grain materials of small grain<br>
sizes, for example less than 50 μm, frequently have a tendency to form lumps, in<br><br>
particular upon storage, and for that reason it is only with difficulty that they can be<br>
sprayed in powder form onto the metal surface. A finer grain size however would<br>
afford the advantage that better layer formation can be achieved, but that advantage in<br>
known compositions of fine grain size is nullified again by the severe tendency to form<br>
lumps.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the present invention was therefore that of providing a high-<br>
temperature lubricant with good trickle and flow characteristics for dissolving scale on<br>
heated metal surfaces, which permits good covering of the metal surface when applied<br>
in powder form and which even after prolonged storage under production conditions<br>
still has good trickle and flow properties without severe lump formation and which<br>
avoids the use of graphite.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
According to the invention that object is attained by a high-temperature<br>
lubricant for the hot processing of metals comprising a mixture of fine-powder<br>
materials, wherein the mixture includes at least the following constituents:<br>
(a)	a secondary and/or tertiary calcium phosphate compound,<br>
(b)	a fatty acid or a fatty acid salt,<br>
(c)	boric acid, a boric acid salt (borate) and/or a mineral containing boric acid<br>
salt (borate), and<br>
(d)	condensed alkali metal phosphates,<br>
and wherein the constituents of the mixture have a mean grain size of 
lubricant does not contain any addition of graphite.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the mixture according to the invention with<br>
the constituents (a), (b), (c) and (d) is particularly well suited as a lubricant for the hot<br>
processing of metals. It will be appreciated that the lubricant according to the invention<br>
may include further constituents if they do not substantially detrimentally influence the<br>
desired advantageous properties.<br>
Secondary and/or tertiary calcium phosphate compounds have surprisingly<br>
proven to be particularly suitable trickle flow aids in a high-temperature lubricant of the<br>
kind according to the invention for the hot processing of metals. Monocalcium<br>
phosphate is unsuitable as it leads to lump formation in the presence of humidity in the<br><br>
air. The calcium phosphate compound of the high-temperature lubricant according to<br>
the invention is quite particularly preferably selected from hydroxyapatite<br>
[Ca5(PO4)3OH] and tricalcium phosphate [Ca3(PO4)2], with hydroxyapatite being<br>
particularly preferred.<br>
The mixture of the high-temperature lubricant according to the invention further<br>
includes a fatty acid or a fatty acid salt in combination with the other constituents. It<br>
has surprisingly been found that the use of a fatty acid or a fatty acid salt means that<br>
lump formation of the fine-grain powder can be considerably reduced and the capability<br>
of withstanding storage can be improved. Without the applicants hereby feeling<br>
themselves bound down to a theory, it is assumed that the fatty acid or the fatty acid<br>
salt is attached to the grains of one or more further constituents of the mixture and in<br>
that way prevents or reduces lump formation of the grains, keeps moisture away from<br>
the grains and thereby improves the capacity for withstanding storage as well as the<br>
trickle or flow characteristics of the lubricant.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the high-temperature lubricant according to the<br>
invention the fatty acid or the fatty acid salt is selected from saturated and unsaturated<br>
fatty acids with 6 to 26 carbon atoms or salts thereof. Particularly preferably the fatty<br>
acid or the fatty acid salt is selected from capronic acid, caprylic acid, capric acid,<br>
lauric acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, arachic acid,<br>
behenic acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid,<br>
vaccenic acid, icosic acid, erucic acid, nervonic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid,<br>
arachidonic acid, timnodonic acid, clupanodonic acid and salts thereof. Quite<br>
particularly preferably the fatty acid or the fatty acid salt is stearic acid or the salt<br>
thereof, in particular magnesium stearate. A prerequisite for the selection is that the<br>
fatty acid or the fatty acid salt is in the form of a solid at a temperature &gt; 30°C.<br>
As a further constituent the high-temperature lubricant according to the<br>
invention contains boric acid, a boric acid salt (borate) and/or a mineral containing<br>
boric acid salt (borate). Boric acid [H3BO3], borax [Na2B4O5(OH)4 8H2O or<br>
Na2B4O7 10H2O], further sodium borates such as Na2B4O7 5H2O, Na2B4O7 (water-free),<br>
sodium metaborate [Na2BO2 4H20] and boric acid anhydride [B2O3] are particularly<br>
preferred. The use according to the invention of boric acid, a boric acid salt (borate)<br>
and/or a mineral containing a boric acid salt (borate) improves uniform distribution of<br><br>
the lubricant on the metal surface and reduces scale formation. At the high<br>
temperatures of the metal processing operation the high-temperature lubricant forms a<br>
molten material.<br>
As a further constituent the high-temperature lubricant according to the<br>
invention contains condensed alkali metal phosphates, preferably condensed sodium or<br>
potassium phosphates or mixtures thereof, particularly preferably polyphosphates<br>
and/or pyrophosphates and/or metaphosphates or mixtures thereof. Disodium<br>
pyrophosphate [Na2H2P2O7], trisodium pyrophosphate [Na3HP2O7], tetrasodium<br>
pyrophosphate [Na4P2O7], sodium tripolyphosphate [Na5P3O10], sodium<br>
trimetaphosphate [(NaPO3)3], sodium polyphosphate [(NaP03)n], dipotassium<br>
pyrophosphate [K2H2P2O7], tripotassium pyrophosphate [K3HP2O7], tetrapotassium<br>
pyrophosphate [K4P2O7], potassium tripolyphosphate [K5P3O10], potassium<br>
trimetaphosphate [(KPO3)3] and/or potassium polyphosphate [(KPO3)n] are quite<br>
particularly preferred, with sodium tripolyphosphate [Na5P3O10] being most preferred.<br>
It has been found that the use of a polyphosphate and/or a pyrophosphate and/or a<br>
metaphosphate in the mixture of the high-temperature lubricant according to the<br>
invention advantageously contribute inter alia to scale dissolution.<br>
In the high-temperature lubricant according to the invention the constituents of<br>
the mixture have a mean grain size of 
of the mixture of 
particularly preferred. The low mean grain sizes of the constituents of the mixture<br>
according to the invention provide that the trickle and flow characteristics of the high-<br>
temperature lubricant according to the invention are considerably improved in<br>
comparison with known lubricants, spraying onto surfaces in the form of powder is<br>
easier and better and more uniform layer formation or coating on the metal surface is<br>
guaranteed. At the same time the combination of the constituents according to the<br>
invention of the mixture prevents or reduces lump formation which usually occurred in<br>
the case of lubricants in accordance with the state of the art of small grain sizes and<br>
resulted in serious shortcomings.<br>
It is further preferred if the constituents of the mixture of the high-temperature<br>
lubricant according to the invention have a mean grain size of &gt; 3 μm, preferably &gt; 10<br>
urn, particularly preferably &gt; 15 μm. It has been found that excessively small mean<br><br>
grain sizes on the one hand can be produced only with very great difficulty and<br>
complication and at comparatively high costs while on the other hand they also increase<br>
the tendency to lump formation again. A mean grain size in the range of 20 to 50 μm<br>
has therefore proven to be optimum.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the high-temperature lubricant according to the<br>
invention the secondary or tertiary calcium phosphate compound (a) is included in the<br>
mixture in an amount of 0.1 to 15 % by weight, preferably 0.5 to 10 % by weight,<br>
particularly preferably from 1 to 5 % by weight.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the high-temperature lubricant according<br>
to the invention the fatty acid or the fatty acid salt (b) is contained in the mixture in an<br>
amount of 0.1 to 15 % by weight, preferably 1 to 10 % by weight, particularly<br>
preferably from 3 to 7 % by weight.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the high-temperature lubricant according<br>
to the invention boric acid, boric acid salt (borate) and/or a mineral (c) containing boric<br>
acid salt (borate) is contained in the mixture in an amount of 5 to 30 % by weight,<br>
preferably 10 to 25 % by weight, particularly preferably 15 to 20 % by weight.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the high-temperature lubricant according<br>
to the invention polyphosphate and/or pyrophosphate and/or metaphosphate (d) is<br>
contained in the mixture in an amount of 60 to 95 % by weight, preferably 70 to 85 %<br>
by weight, particularly preferably 75 to 80 % by weight.<br>
Storage characteristics, agglomerate formation and moisture absorption<br>
Storage tests in respect of various mixtures were carried out under production<br>
conditions to test the tendency to lump formation under production conditions. For that<br>
purpose 150 g of sample was stored in an air-conditioning cabinet (type 3821/15 from<br>
Feutron) at a constant 30°C and 80 % relative air humidity for 0 h, 67 h and 96 h, and<br>
then its agglomerate formation (trickle flow capability) was determined in a sieve test<br>
and its moisture absorption was determined on the basis of the increase in weight in<br>
comparison to the original weighing.<br>
It is only the overall assessment of combined storage and trickle flow<br>
characteristics of a respective mixture, that permits information to be afforded about its<br>
quality and suitability under production conditions. The results of the investigation on<br>
various mixtures are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Determining grain size<br>
The operation of determining the mean grain size of the mixture or of the<br>
constituents of the mixture of the high-temperature lubricant according to the invention<br>
is effected by means of a laser granulometer Cilas model 715/920 from Cilas U.S. Inc.<br>
About 80 mg of sample is suspended in propan-2-ol and measurement is effected a<br>
minute after production of the suspension in accordance with the manufacturers'<br>
instructions.<br><br><br><br>
