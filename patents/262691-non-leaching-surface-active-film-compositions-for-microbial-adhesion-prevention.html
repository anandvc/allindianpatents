				<td>NON-LEACHING SURFACE-ACTIVE FILM COMPOSITIONS FOR<br>
MICROBIAL ADHESION PREVENTION<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to surface-active, non-leaching antimicrobial<br>
film forming compositions and methods for their application to a surface to provide<br>
the surface with non-leaching anti-microbial properties. The compositions of the<br>
present invention form durable coatings with long-lasting anti-microbial efficacy<br>
without formation of a zone of inhibition. The compositions according to the present<br>
invention are also directed to durable non-leaching coatings which exhibit a reduced<br>
tendency for blood coagulation.<br>
Background<br>
Microorganisms can grow and multiply in the presence of water and suitable<br>
temperature conditions with enormous speed. It is estimated that under favorable<br>
temperature and moisture conditions a microbial, e.g., bacterial, population can<br>
double every 20 minutes. Protection from dangerous levels of microbes by various<br>
methods is a must in our daily life. Infection prevention by rinsing with water or<br>
washing off with soap and water is a common process to reduce the levels of<br>
microbial organisms on our skin. Numerous anti-microbial agents or materials,<br>
having varying water solubility and bioavailability to kill microbes, are also used in a<br>
wide range of concentrations and applications. Examples of such agents or materials<br>
include biocides, preservatives, anti-microbials and antibiotics. The mode of action<br>
for such agents can vary.<br>
One method for controlling the growth and proliferation of microorganisms is<br>
to provide a controlled amount of an anti-microbial agent and have it constantly<br>
available to kill in the vicinity of the agent. The antimicrobial agent can be embedded<br>
or encapsulated in certain media with a specific release mechanism to ensure<br><br>
microbial kill for the protection of an underlying substrate or for the gradual release<br>
into an environment, which needs to be protected from microbial attack over an<br>
extended period of time. From a biological test method point of view the<br>
antimicrobials form a kill zone or area around the media in which they are embedded<br>
or encapsulated that varies according to concentration and strength of efficacy of the<br>
antimicrobial. A certain amount leaches out constantly to provide a zone in which no<br>
organism can survive. The eluted amount must be above the Minimum Inhibiting<br>
Concentration (MIC). Usually a killing potential of around 95% is used to establish<br>
the MIC value of an antimicrobial. MIC values are commonly measured, to compare<br>
efficacy strength between different antimicrobials. The resulting area of no microbial<br>
growth is known as the "Zone of Inhibition."<br>
Other terms used to describe antimicrobial function include bacteriostatic,<br>
fungistatic and biostatic. The definitions were in many cases overlapping with the<br>
terms bactericidal, iungicidal and biocidal. In general, however, the -cidal terms<br>
stand for eradicating or eliminating completely where as the -static terms stand for<br>
keeping the amount just in balance. Thus, -static refers to agents which kill organisms<br>
in an amount substantially equal to newly evolving organisms. From an MIC value<br>
point of view, as discussed above, the value would be about 50% killing strength.<br>
However, the mode of action of an active chemical compound as bacteriostatic and<br>
bacteriocidal ingredient is still considered to be the same. U.S. Patent No. 2,510,428<br>
discloses bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal concentrations ranging from 0.1ppm to 5%<br>
for 2,3 diphenylindol, which relies on a concentration gradient for antimicrobial<br>
efficacy. GB 871228 discloses a biostatic plastic formed by extrusion of<br>
styrene/acylonitril containing chlorophenols. GB871228 states that antimicrobial<br>
efficacy is maintained after repeated washing and after years of use. The<br>
chlorophenols migrate to the surface of the plastic to provide biostatic activity.<br>
However, this forms a zone of inhibition around the surface of the plastic and the<br>
chlorophenols gradually deplete over time.<br>
Wherever there is a free access of surfaces by microbial organisms, adherence<br>
of the organisms to such surfaces occurs and microbial contamination of these<br><br>
surfaces is a consequence. As a further consequence, it would be beneficial for<br>
numerous applications to prevent adherence of such organisms to a surface. Several<br>
methods for accomplishing this have been suggested. One way would be to<br>
constantly heat the surface to a temperature beyond the survival temperature of the<br>
organisms. This is not always practical or economical. Other ways of establishing an<br>
anti-microbial surface property that have been suggested include immobilizing<br>
antimicrobial, antiseptic or antibiotic agents on the surface of interest, for example,<br>
cellulosicsynthetic textile or medical device surfaces, to reduce bacterial adhesion<br>
and subsequently prevent bacterial infection. The surfaces are prepared by<br>
entrapment or embedding of antimicrobial compounds in surface coatings. These<br>
surfaces involve a leaching mechanism and create a zone of inhibition. Chemically<br>
bonding (electrostatic, ionic or covalent) of active ingredients has also been suggested<br>
to achieve microbial adhesion prevention on surfaces of interest. However, in many<br>
cases the toxicological side effects are a concern, for example, in the case of covalent<br>
bonding of pentachlorophenol to a polymeric matrix. In most other cases the<br>
antimicrobial efficacy is lost due to the synthesis of a different molecular entity.<br>
Other attempts at immobilizing active ingredients to provide a non-leaching<br>
anti-microbial property that have been suggested include an ionic quat bonding<br>
mechanism, such as antimicrobial surface active polymers as discussed in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,229,838; 4,613,517; 4,678,660; 4,713,402; and 5,451,424. However, the ionic<br>
bonding drastically limits the longevity of efficacy of such surfaces. Over a relative<br>
short time in an aqueous environment the ionicly bonded antimicrobial moieties will<br>
be washed out. Additional examples of surface active polymers are discussed in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,783,502; 6,251,967; and 6,497,868, as well as in U.S. Published<br>
Application Nos. 2002/0051754,2002/0177828, 2003/0175503 and 2003/117579.<br>
Although these references discuss reduced leaching of the active anti-microbial agent,<br>
they do disclose a covalent bonding mechanism or hydrophilic surface properties<br>
which provide long term efficacy for a non-leaching moiety. Further, there are other<br>
references that suggest the use of non-leaching active anti-microbial agents to provide<br>
an anti-microbial surface, but include a definition of "non-leaching" that would<br>
provide a zone of inhibition.<br><br>
Antimicrobial surfaces employing long-chain antimicrobials with specific<br>
functional groups have also been proposed. As opposed to making antimicrobials<br>
available in solution, where organisms are attacked in free flowing aqueous or less<br>
mobile but moist environments with relative small biocidal molecular entities, it is<br>
suggested that the long chain antimicrobials provide killing surfaces by a different<br>
mode of action. The suggested mode of action involves the long chain molecular<br>
moieties penetrating the microbial cell. The pierced cell dies and the anchored long<br>
chain is ready for the next cell to be pierced. However, the prior art methods utilizing<br>
long chain antimicrobials have drawbacks which include significantly reduced<br>
efficacy over time, due to insufficient bonding to the surface or a build-up of dead<br>
microbial bodies on the surface, and the formation of a zone of inhibition due to<br>
leaching or detachment of the penetrating moieties.<br>
It is an object of this invention to provide compositions which form durable<br>
coatings with long lasting antimicrobial efficacy without formation of a zone of<br>
inhibition and without the drawbacks discussed above.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide surface active antimicrobial film<br>
forming compositions that include long chain molecules that chemically bond with a<br>
polymeric matrix upon drying or curing of the matrix to provide a non-leaching<br>
surface having long lasting antimicrobial efficacy.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide coatings in accordance with the<br>
preceding objects which are optionally hydrophilic and lubricious organic coatings<br>
which have good adherence to substrates, and, for applications involving contact with<br>
blood, to provide such coatings which do not trigger blood coagulation on the coated<br>
surfaces.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is a non-leaching anti-microbial coating composition<br>
which provides surfaces upon drying and evaporation of its carrier solvents with<br>
microbial, e.g., bacterial, adhesion prevention. The present invention also includes a<br>
method of preparing and applying the composition of the invention. The mode of<br>
action is believed to be a microbial cell wall piercing mechanism without forming a<br>
zone of inhibition due to leaching. A polymeric matrix with reactive groups is reacted<br>
with counterparts of reactive groups of specific antimicrobial molecules to form a new chemically; e.g. covalently, bonded, non-leaching polymeric matrix- and converting<br>
the original antimicrobial potential based on leaching into an anti-microbial potential<br>
without leaching.<br>
The piercing moieties of prepared surfaces are immobilized and do not leach<br>
out. The piercing moieties axe preferably covalently bonded so that they are not<br>
subject of easy hydrolysis, which would allow the piercing moieties to be released and<br>
washed away. In terms of MIC, there is preferably no zone of inhibition formed and<br>
the MIC value is far below the 50% value, and is preferably close to or equal to zero.<br>
In praxis surfaces coated with the composition of the present invention, cured and<br>
exposed to micro-organisms, preferably do not exhibit a zone of inhibition, but still<br>
prevent growth or colonization of micro-organisms on treated surfaces.<br>
The resulting non-leaching anti-microbial coated surfaces can be made<br>
optionally highly lubricous. Covalent links of the polymer to the antimicrobial can be<br>
establish by the functions of esters, ethers, thioesters, thioethers, carbamates,<br>
urethanes, ureas, amids or linking mechanisms commonly used in polymerization<br>
such as radical polymerization or converting unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds into<br>
higher molecular branched single carbon-carbon bonds. The polymeric surface<br>
coating on a substrate with microbial adhesion prevention property of the present<br>
invention preferably withstands extensive exposure to a leaching solution without<br>
losing its anti-microbial property. The coated substrates preferably do not form a<br>
zone of inhibition as determined by bioassay. Suitable carrier solvents can include<br><br>
water, methyl ethyl ketones, N-methylpyrrolidones, tetrahydrofurans, ethyl lactates,<br>
dichloromethanes, chloroforms, ethyl acetates, propylene glycol methyl ethers,<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a non-leaching, anti-microbial coating<br>
composition providing surfaces upon drying and evaporation of the carrier solvents of<br>
the composition with a bacteria adhesion prevention surface coating. The present<br>
invention also includes methods for preparing and applying the composition of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
As used in the specification and claims hereof, the following terms have the<br>
particular meanings and definitions set forth below:<br>
The term "chemical bond" as used herein is meant to be interpreted broadly to<br>
encompass not only covalent bonding and ionic bonding but also interactions, such as,<br>
for example, van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding to the degree that they can<br>
not be overcome by hydrolytic interaction-with water so as to cause the originally<br>
linked antimicrobial to become teachable and form a cleaved antimicrobial entity that<br>
creates a zone of inhibition.<br>
The term "antimicrobial" as used herein is meant to include a material that<br>
engages in a biological activity or which is effective against microorganisms.<br>
Antimicrobial moieties suitable for use in the present invention can include anionic,<br>
cationic and non-ionic surfactants that provide, after curing the coating composition,<br>
an antimicrobial, non-leaching durable film, which functions without formation of a<br>
zone of inhibition due to leaching.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention preferably includes a<br>
polymeric matrix containing functional groups that can bond covalently with amine,<br>
thiol, carboxyl, aldehyde or hydroxyl active groups of selected long chain anionic,<br>
cationic and non-ionic surfactant compounds. The length of the selected long chain<br>
compounds are long enough to protrude through organic debris deposited over time<br>
on the resulting coating during use. These long chain compounds become non-<br>
leaching upon curing of the coating composition and are capable of penetrating cell<br>
walls of microbial organisms and disrupting cell functional activities to prevent<br>
microbial colonization on the coated surface.<br>
The long chain antimicrobials can include either an unsubstituted amine<br>
moiety, a hydroxy moiety, an aldehyde or a chemical moiety capable of forming<br>
either a covalent bond with an amine moiety (such as, for example, an aldehyde<br>
moiety, an epoxide moiety or an isocyanate moiety) or a chemical moiety capable of<br>
forming an ionic bond with an amine moiety (such as, for example, a phosphate<br><br>
moiety, a sulphate moiety or a carboxylate moiety), or any possible combination of<br>
any one or more of these moieties alone or in combination. In addition, the term<br>
"antimicrobial molecule" as used herein may mean any one or more of an<br>
antimicrobial molecule alone or a combination of different antimicrobials.<br>
Furthermore the unsubstituted amine function of the antimicrobial may serve as<br>
starting function to modulate into more reactive isocyanate function by known<br>
reaction with phosgene or phosgene derivatives. In general the individual functional<br>
group can either be present at the polymeric backbone, the crosslinker or the<br>
antimicrobial to complement the functional group with out limitation of the position<br>
in the polymeric matrix or in the antimicrobial moiety.<br>
The term non-leachable as used herein means that the coating is no longer<br>
releasing quantities of an original antimicrobial moiety in concentrations that are<br>
biologically active, i.e., they are not biocidal anymore in terms of a zone of inhibition.<br>
The leach-out concentrations are below the actual efficacy levels in an aqueous<br>
solution and therefore do not control microbial growth. Test samples coated with<br>
compositions of the present invention were subjected to extensive leaching in the<br>
presence of saline solution or demineralized water for at least 28 days prior to<br>
biological testing. Coatings according to the invention did not lose their efficacy after<br>
the 28-day leaching cycle, confirming that the antimicrobial moiety was bonded to the<br>
surface. The non-leaching antimicrobial status, after the 28-day leaching cycle, was<br>
confirmed by microbial testing when a.) no zone of inhibition is detected and b.) no<br>
adhesion or growth of microbes was evident after 24 his of microbial exposure and 5<br>
days of incubation time of the leached surfaces which were coated with the<br>
compositions according to the present invention.<br>
The antimicrobial coatings according to the invention, upon drying and curing,<br>
provide a non-leaching antimicrobial surface with long term efficacy against a target<br>
microorganism for, preferably, at least about 3 months. Preferably, the efficacy is<br>
maintained for at least about 6 months, more preferably at least about 9 months and,<br>
most preferably, at least about 1 year. The target microorganisms can include<br>
Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus.<br><br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a polymeric matrix with reactive<br>
groups is reacted with counterparts of reactive groups of specific antimicrobial<br>
molecules to form a new covalently bonded moiety in a non-leaching polymeric<br>
matrix by converting the original anti-microbial into an anti-microbial surface active<br>
polymeric coating which does not have a mode of action based on a leaching. In<br>
another embodiment, the c'ovalent links can be established by crosslinkers. Thus, the<br>
covalent links of the polymer to the antimicrobial can be establish by the functions of<br>
esters, ethers, thioesters, thioethers, carbamates, urethanes, ureas, amids or linking<br>
mechanisms commonly used in polymerization such as radical polymerization or<br>
converting unsaturated carbon-carbon bonds into higher molecular branched single<br>
carbon-carbon bonds or by the use of crosslinkers. The resulting non-leaching antimicrobial<br>
coated surfaces can be made optionally highly lubricous.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for attaching an anti-microbial<br>
polymeric coating to a substrate surface and corresponding medical devices. The<br>
present invention provides methods for making a medical device having at least one<br>
anti-microbial surface forming antimicrobial immobilized on a polymeric surface.<br>
One method of the present invention includes converting an antimicrobial molecule<br>
comprising an amine-functional material (RNH2) and combining the amine-functional<br>
material with an aldehyde moiety, an epoxide moiety, an isocyanate moiety, a<br>
phosphate moiety, a sulphate moiety or a carboxylate moiety, which is capable of<br>
forming a chemical bond with the amine-functional material, to bond the two<br>
materials together to form an immobilized antimicrobial or microbiostatic<br>
biomolecule on a medical device surface with or without lubricous property.<br>
Another method of the present invention includes converting an antimicrobial<br>
molecule comprising an hydroxyl-functional material (ROH) and combining the<br>
hydroxyl-functional material with an epoxide moiety, an isocyanate moiety, a<br>
phosphate moiety, a sulphate moiety or a carboxyl moiety, which is capable of<br>
forming a chemical bond with the hydroxyl-functional material, to bond the two<br>
materials to form an immobilized anti-microbial non-leaching polymer on a medical<br><br>
device surface with or without lubricous property. The invention also includes the use<br>
of such modified antimicrobial polymers to coat sheeting materials made of<br>
polycarbonate, PVC, polyurethane, glass, ceramic and the like. The resulting surface<br>
is not only anti-microbial without forming a zone of inhibition (no leaching), but also<br>
has anti-fog and anti-frost properties. Uses for such coatings include greenhouses,<br>
clean room walls, walls of food handling rooms, freezer doors and the like.<br>
Another method of the present invention includes crosslinking reactive antimicrobial<br>
agents to form non-leaching antimicrobial surface coating polymers, which<br>
immobilize the anti-microbial agent. Crosslinkers suitable for immobilizing the<br>
antimicrobial agent, and capable of forming an anti-microbial polymeric surface,<br>
include multifunctional molecules with at least two functionalities of isocyanates,<br>
carboxyl groups, acrylic acid derivatives, aldehyde groups, alcohol groups, aziridines<br>
or carbodiimid. The semi-crosslinked composition material may be employed as an<br>
antimicrobial polymeric material or as an antimicrobial coating. It becomes fully<br>
crosslinked upon drying and curing. In addition, such crosslinked materials may be<br>
further modified to contain optionally additional antimicrobials, antibiotics or drugs<br>
not subject to complete immobilization, covalent bonding or crosslinking with the<br>
afore mentioned crosslinker for the purpose of an intentional and controlled elusion<br>
for supportive antimicrobial or therapeutic performance.<br>
The preferred method of Unking antimicrobials, suitable for a non-leaching<br>
anti-microbial mode of action, is the formation of a covalent bond by reacting an<br>
available free isocyante group from a polyurethane prepolymer with an amine or<br>
hydroxyl group of specific antimicrobial quaternary ammonium compounds which<br>
have long chain molecular moieties. Ionic bonding or other chemical interaction are<br>
only useful for the compositions of the present invention if microbial free surfaces are<br>
detected according to the afore mentioned definition of "non-leachable."<br>
It has been discovered that not all quaternary ammonium compounds have the<br>
desired property of non-leaching and simultaneously maintaining the non-adhering<br><br>
antimicrobial efficacy. Surprisingly, it was found that a quaternary ammonium<br>
compound having the formula below meets these requirements:<br><br>
wherein at least one of the groups R1, R2 or R3 has a length sufficient to penetrate<br>
cell walls of microbial organisms, so as to kill the cells and prevent microbial<br>
colonization over the surface of the cured compositions; and R4 has a length<br>
sufficient so that at least one of the other R groups protrudes through organic debris<br>
deposited over time on the surface of the cured composition and the OH-functional<br>
group on R4 will covalently bond to the polymeric matrix of the coating composition<br>
upon drying or curing of the composition. Preferably, R4 has a length sufficient so<br>
that N is at or protrudes through any organic debris deposited over time on the surface<br>
of the cured composition. Additionally, the R4 group may contain reaction enhancing<br>
groups in the alpha position to the reactive group in R4. These suitable quaternary<br>
ammonium compounds with reaction groups dissolved in water are used for covalent<br>
bonding to residual isocyanate containing polyurethanes contained in the polymeric<br>
matrix of the composition.<br>
Suitable quaternary ammonium compounds have three important designs: (a)<br>
they contain a functional group such as primary amine, hydroxyl or thiol groups to be<br>
able to react with the residual isocyanate group of the PU prepolymer to form a urea,<br>
carbamate and thiocarbamate respectively; (b) the carbon chain with the isocyanate<br>
reacting functional group is long enough to allow the quaternary compound to<br>
protrude through any proteinacious build-up; and (c) the compound contains at least<br>
one additional carbon chain capable of piercing the cell wall of the microbial<br>
organisms. In one embodiment, the additional carbon chain is 13 carbon atoms or<br>
higher.<br><br>
The at least one quaternary ammonium compound is preferably selected from<br>
the group consisting of an alkyl hydroxyethyl dimethyl ammonium chloride<br>
(Praepagen HY), polyquaternium 11, a quatemized copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone<br>
and dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate, polyquaternium 16, polyquaternium 44<br>
(vinylpyrrolidone and quaternized vinyl imidazol), polyquaternium 55 (quaternized<br>
copolymer of vinylpyrrolidone and dimethylaminoethyl), N,N-Dimethyl-N-dodecyl-<br>
N-(2-hydroxy-3-sulfopropyl) ammonium betaine (Ralufon DL-OH), N-alkyl acid<br>
amidopropyl-N,N-dimethyl-N-(3-sulfopTopyl)-ammonium betaine (Ralufon CAS-<br>
OH) and 3-chloro-2-hydroxvpropyl-alkyl-dmiethylammonium chloride with a long<br>
chain alkyl group. Preferred long chain alkyl groups include dodecyl (e.g., Quab<br>
342), cocoalkyl (e.g., Quab 360) and/or stearyl (e.g., Quab 426).<br>
Preferably, the coating composition contains a combination of at least two of<br>
the above-listed quaternary ammonium compounds. Preferred combinations include<br>
the following: (1) Ralufon DL-OH and Quab 360; (2) Praepagen HY and Quab 426;<br>
(3) Quab 342 and Ralufon CAS-OH; and (4) Praepagen HY and Quab 360. More<br>
preferably, the coating composition contains a combination of 3-chloro-2-<br>
hydroxypropyl-stearyl dimethyl ammonium chloride (Quab 426 fromDegussa) and<br>
alkyl hydroxyethyl dimethyl —R- ammonium chloride (Preapagen HY from Clarient).<br>
Preferably, the combinations of quaternary compounds are included in the ratio of<br>
about 3:1 to about 1:3 relative to each other.<br>
Preferably, the coating composition also includes a hydrophilic organic<br>
monomer, oligomer, prepolymer, polymer or copolymer derived from vinyl alcohol,<br>
N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinyl lactam, acrylamide, amide, styrenesulfonic acid,<br>
combination of vinylbutyral and N-vinylpyrrolidone, hydroxyethyl methacrylate,<br>
acrylic acid, vinylmethyl ether, vinylpyridylium halide, methyl cellulose, ethyl<br>
cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxymethyl ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropymethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate,<br>
cellulose nitrate, starch, gelatin, albumin, casein, gum, alginate, hydroxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, ethylene glycol (meth)acrylates (e.g.<br>
triethylene glycol (meth)acrylate) and meth)acrylamide), N-alkyl (meth) acrylamides<br><br>
(e.g. N-methyl (meth)acrylamide and N-hexyl (meth)acrylamide), N,N-dialkyl<br>
(meth)acrylamides (e.g. N,N-dimethyl (meth)acrylamide and poly-N,N-dipropyl<br>
(meth)acrylamide), N-hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylamide polymers, such as poly-N-<br>
methylol (meth)acrylamide and poly-N-hydroxy ethyl (meth)acrylamide, and N,N-<br>
dihydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylamide polymers, such as poly-N,N-dihydroxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylamide, ether polyols, polyethylene oxide, polypropylene oxide, and<br>
polyvinyl ether), alkylvinyl sulfones, alkylvinylsulfone-acrylates or a combination<br>
thereof.<br>
More preferably, the coating composition includes a hydrophilic polymer,<br>
copolymer or prepolymer selected from the group consisting of polyvinylpyrrolidone,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, alkylpolyol, alkoxypolyol, polysaccharide, polyglucosamid,<br>
polyglucosamine and combinations thereof. Preferably, the hydrophilic polymer,<br>
copolymer or prepolymer is present in an amount from about 0.1% to about 40%, and<br>
more preferably from about 0.2% to about 15%, based on the weight of the<br>
composition in replacement of the carrier solvent. The hydrophilic polymer,<br>
copolymer or prepolymer is most preferably polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP).<br>
In regard to the combination of a polyurethane, a quaternary ammonium<br>
compound and a carrier solvent, as discussed above, it is believed that the hydrophilic<br>
polymers unexpectedly enhance the performance of the antimicrobial coating. It was<br>
discovered that some quaternary ammonium containing coatings required a certain<br>
amount of PVP to assure proper activation when the cured coating is transferred into a<br>
hydrolyzed and activated coating. The amount of PVP required can be at least about<br>
an equivalent amount to the quaternary compound before a noticeable lubricity is<br>
achieved.<br>
The preferred PVP concentration is about 0.1 to about 5% of the coating<br>
composition, where no specific lubricity is intended. The preferred PVP<br>
concentration is about 2 to about 12% of the coating composition, where high<br>
lubricity is intended.<br><br>
While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the dipole-dipole<br>
interaction between the hydrophilic polymer and water is needed to penetrate along<br>
the PVP complex to orient the quaternary ammonium complex into an upright<br>
position. This is believed to enhance the antimicrobial function of the cured<br>
composition by orienting the antimicrobial compound to project away from the<br>
surface of the cured coating.<br>
In one embodiment, the coating composition can also include at least one<br>
auxiliary agent for performance enhancement of the coating composition and/or the<br>
resulting coating on the coated surface.<br>
Preferably, the auxiliary agent is selected from a surfactant or wetting agent,<br>

enhancing is from 0.001% to 10%, preferable from 0.01% to 5%, based upon the<br>
weight of the coating composition.<br>
in one embodiment, the coating composition contains an organic solvent in an<br>
amount of from 0% to 50% and water in an amount of from 0.5% to 95%, preferably<br>
1% to 50% by weight<br><br>

The present invention can be used to prepare, inter alia, agricultural products,<br>
cleaning compositions, antimicrobial sponges, antimicrobial bleaching agents,<br>
antimicrobial fillers for paints, plastics, or concrete, and to treat concrete structures<br>
such as livestock shelters, where microbial infestation is a problem.<br>

Coatings of the present invention can also be suitable in military applications,<br>
such as protection against biological warfare, self-decontamination of war planes,<br>
cargo and shipping boxes, envelopes, uniforms, army ducts and the like.<br>
Moreover, after treating a surface or fabric with the compositions of the<br>
present invention, the surface or fabric may, optionally, be heated to further complete<br>
cross linking and bonding of the composition to the surface or substrate upon<br>
evaporation of carrier solvents.<br>
Treating food crops (e.g., perishables such as vegetables, fruits, or grains) in a<br>
pre or post harvest process with the compositions of the present invention imparts<br>
antimicrobial protection to the outer surface of the food crop. It is believed that such<br>
protection occurs without diffusing, migrating or leaching the antimicrobial agent<br>
from the bonded antimicrobial coating of the food item, and provides prolonged, safe<br>
and non-toxic antimicrobial protection. The method involves treating fruits and<br>
vegetables in the rinse cycle, during or after the normal cleaning/water spraying or<br>
during or after blanching. Thorough cleaning of fruits and vegetables at the<br>
processing plant is preferred for initially removing microorganisms. As one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art would recognize, machines are used initially to remove soil,<br>
chemicals used in growing, spoilage bacteria, and other foreign materials. These<br>
machines also use high velocity water sprays to clean the products. After the<br>
cleaning, raw foods or other crop materials are prepared for further processing such as<br>
blanching (i.e., the food is immersed in water at 190 to 210 °F or exposed to steam).<br>
Treating surgical gloves with the compounds, products and compositions of<br>
the present invention before or during a surgical procedure can prevent colonization<br><br>
and cross contamination. It is believed that the treated gloves provide prolonged<br>
antimicrobial activity with safe and non-toxic antimicrobial protection. Surgical<br>
gloves are treated, preferably, by submerging in a composition of the present<br>
invention. This method will permit doctors to use the gloves with lower risk of cross<br>
contamination.<br>
Moreover, one of ordinary skill in the art would be able to implement<br>
numerous other end uses based upon the disclosure of the compounds, products and<br>
compositions of the present invention. For instance, the following uses, applications<br>
and substrates, are also contemplated in particularly preferred embodiments: treating<br>
orthopedic implants, skin or other tissues (bone, soft tissues) for use in a transplant to<br>
reduce microbial contamination. The composition is likewise useful in any toothpaste<br>
formulation known in the art to enhance the caries-fighting properties of such<br>
compositions through anti-microbial treatment of teeth.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the above-described antimicrobial compounds,<br>
products, compositions, and methods are set forth in the examples below. Other<br>
features of the invention will become apparent from the following examples, which<br>
are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended as a limitation upon the present<br>
invention.<br>
The antimicrobial coating composition of the present invention has a number<br>
of advantages over conventional biocide eluting coatings, as well as over the alleged<br>
bacteriostatic, non-eluting compositions of prior art. The advantageous properties of<br>
the anti-bacterial coating composition of the present invention after curing are:<br>
the resulting coating film does not leach-out any anti-microbial agent; the antimicrobial<br>
agent is immobilized by the coating polymeric matrix; the resulting coating<br>
film has a long lasting efficacy against microbes; the resulting coating film, with its<br>
non-leaching mode of action, has no side effects or secondary toxicity, which is<br>
important for products requiring regulatory approval; and the resulting coating film<br>
can optionally be lubricous for a wide variety of applications in medical, veterinarian,<br><br>
food packaging, textile, polymeric fabric, household, personal care, consumer goods,<br>
anti-fog, construction, agricultural and other applications.<br>
Additional testing of the molecular and cell-biological impact was also<br>
evaluated. The coating according to the present invention did not reveal a<br>
cytotoxicity potential according to standard test method ISO 100993, part 5.<br>
- Exposure to protein solution did not reveal a compromise in long-term, non-leaching<br>
antimicrobial performance. These findings are particularly important when a coating<br>
of the present invention is applied in the medical area where tissue contact is involved<br>
as well as when in contact with food-protein or body protein.<br>
Blood contact tests surprisingly revealed an impact on the coagulation speed<br>
where blood is brought into contact with surfaces, treated according to the present<br>
invention. The blood tends to coagulate slower or not at all when in contact with<br>
treated surface according to the present invention.<br>
With a dynamic test procedure simulating the flow rate of a bile solution<br>
containing microbes, it was discovered that over at least one week there was no slime<br>
or biofilm build up on a surface coated according to the present invention. Uncoated<br>
samples and samples with lubricious coating (without the antimicrobial compound)<br>
showed biofilm formation in this dynamic test, within one week.<br>
Experimental<br>
Leaching Procedure<br>
Compositions according to the present invention were coated onto 2cm by<br>
2cm polyurethane test samples on one side, air-dried for about 10 minutes and then<br>
oven-dried and cured at elevated temperature around 50 to 95 °C for about 30 min.<br>
The cured samples were subject to washing in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) for 1,<br>
7, 14, 21 and 28 days, and for 2 and 3 months and longer at about 23 °C. The samples<br>
were placed in 100ml leaching solution of PBS. After brief shaking the 100ml<br>
leaching solution was replaced once every week. After each time interval the samples<br><br>
were rinsed 3 times in 5ml of demineralized water, dried for 10 min at room<br>
temperature and then subject to microbial testing.<br>
Coating Solution Preparation<br>
Coating solutions containing PU, and optionally PVP, according to the prior<br>
art were prepared. To these solutions was added 10% of a polyurethane prepolymer<br>
containing about 6% free isocyanate groups measured by titration prior to the<br>
addition.<br>
The percentage isocyanate concentration present in the polyurethane<br>
prepolymer was determined with 25ml of a 0.1 N dibutyl amine solution (slight<br>
excess of expected amount) and mixed for 15 minutes. The excess was titrated back<br>
with 0.1 n HCl against a bromophenol blue indicator until faint yellow was seen.<br>
Preparation and Use of Coating Solutions<br>
The free isocyanate containing coating solutions were briefly mixed and then<br>
5% to 15% of the 40 to 90% aqueous solutions of quaternary ammonium compounds<br>
(containing an active group according to the present invention) were added and briefly<br>
mixed again. The mixture was left for observation in a first evaluation for reactivity.<br>
The mixtures were observed to gel in about 2 to 4 hours, indicating a slow reaction<br>
speed, which gives time for the actual coating process.<br>
Further samples of coating solutions with reactive groups containing<br>
antimicrobials and long carbon-carbon chains according to the present invention were<br>
prepared in a similar way. The final coating solution was applied immediately after<br>
mixing of the additional isocyanate containing polyurethane prepolymer and the<br>
reactive group containing antimicrobials for about 15 minutes. The coatings had good<br>
adhesion and did not deteriorate in the presence of water or PBS. Some of the<br>
samples had lubricous properties.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that despite of the presence of water, there is<br>
sufficient interaction with the competition reaction of the residual isocyanate and the<br><br>
primary amine, hydroxyl and thiol function of the antimicrobial. It was also found<br>
that the final composition has a pot life of a few hours, depending on temperature,<br>
reactive group of antimicrobial and possible catalytic interaction. The reactive<br>
coating composition is applied to a variety of substrates, cured and subsequently<br>
washed with water to remove any excess of unreacted antimicrobial. It was repeated<br>
several times with fresh PBS on a weekly basis to assure complete removal.<br>
Microbial Testing<br>
Bacterial suspension of E. coli and Ps. aeruginosa and St. aureus with 1 x 106<br>
cells/ml each in sterile buffer solution were prepared for microbial exposure. 25ul of<br>
the suspension were dropped onto the sample inside a Petri dish and immediately<br>
covered with agar plates. The dish was closed, sealed and incubated at 37 °C for 24<br>
hours. After incubation the bacterial growth of colonies were counted after 5 days in<br>
the closed dish avoiding the agar to get dry. Colony counts were recorded<br>
numerically and by microphotographs to show extent of microbial growth for samples<br>
and controls for each organism after each week of the total leaching period. The<br>
bacteria tests are performed at 37°C and allowed 24 hours to grow on the<br>
polyurethane coated surface. A bacteria pellet supplied by MicroBioLogics (ATCC #<br>
25922 for E. coli and ATCC # 29213 for S. aureus) was cultured in 5 ml of LB Broth<br>
solution and allowed to incubate for 4 hours before 40 l were pipetted onto the<br>
coated polyurethane surface. Results were viewed with a 20X microscope.<br>
Examples:<br>
Controls<br>
Formulations according to patents US 4,467,073, US 4,642,267 and US<br>
6,054,504 were used as controls containing no antimicrobial with and without<br>
additional polyurethane prepolymer containing additional isocyanate groups.<br>
Uncoated Sample<br>
After the leaching procedure described above, primarily 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28<br>
days of leaching, the uncoated polyurethane samples showed significant bacterial<br><br>
overgrowth or colonization with the organisms Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus<br>
aureus according to the described microbial test method.<br>
Example 1 - A typical medical base formulation for the application of the present<br>
invention were prepared using the starting coating solution according to US Patent<br>
4,642,267, Example 1, as follows:<br>
To a mixture of 75 g diacetone alcohol and 25 g methyl ethyl ketone is added<br>
4 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (Kollidon 90, BASF Corp.) and 2 g linear polyurethane<br>
(Estane 5703, B. F. Goodrich Co.). To 10 g of the resulting solution was added 0.5g<br>
of a linear polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2,<br>
Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.) and 0.25g of the quaternary ammonium compound 3-chloro-<br>
2-hydroxypropyl-stearyl-dimethyl ammonium chloride (Quab 426). The resulting<br>
solution was applied to such substrates as polyurethane resins and permitted to dry.<br>
The resulting coating was a highly durable coating, which was slippery when wet and<br>
had antimicrobial property by preventing bacterial colonization without depletion of<br>
efficacy over extended period of leaching. No zone of inhibition was detectable after<br>
the initial burst and release of unreacted quat during initial leaching.<br>
Example 2 - A typical anti-fog base formulation for the application of the present<br>
invention were prepared using the starting coating solution according to US Patent<br>
4,467,073, Example 1, as follows:<br>
2.5 g, Polyvinylpyrrolidone, PVP-K90, was dissolved in 100 ml of a mixture<br>
of 75% diacetone alcohol and 25% cyclohexane, followed by 1.0 g dioctyl sodium<br>
sulfosuccinate surfactant and 5.0 g Tycel 7351 isocyanate prepolymer (Hughson<br>
Chemicals, Lord Corporation). To 10 g of the resulting solution was added 0.5g of a<br>
linear polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2,<br>
Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.) and 0.25g of the quaternary ammonium compound 3-chloro-<br>
2-hydroxypropyl-cocoalkyl-dimethyl ammonium chloride (Quab 360). Coatings<br>
applied according to this composition and cured 24 hours at 72 °F were transparent,<br>
colorless, hard and scratch resistant and did not fog when cooled to 32 °F and then<br>
held over a beaker of boiling water. The coating had excellent adhesion to<br>
polycarbonate, polyester, polymethylmethacrylate and cellulose acetate plastics and<br><br>
had antimicrobial properties by preventing bacterial colonization without depletion of<br>
efficacy over extended period of leaching. No zone of inhibition was detectable after<br>
the initial burst and release of unreacted quat during initial leaching.<br>
Example 3 - A typical medical base formulation was prepared according to US Patent<br>
4,642,267, Example 2, as follows:<br>
To 47 g of water and 10 g N-methylpyrrolidone is added 10 g of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (Kollidon 90, BASF Corp.) and 33 g of linear polyurethane<br>
aqueous dispersion (Neorez R940, Polyvinyl Chemical Industries). Films cast from<br>
the resulting viscous dispersion were lubricious when wet (coefficient of friction 0.08)<br>
and imbibe water forming elastic, transparent films useful as burn and wound<br>
dressings. The solution can also be used to spin fibers which are tough and elastic<br>
when wet and can be used to produce hydrophilic foams via either mechanical<br>
frothing or casting films with added acetone and drying with heat in vacuum.<br>
Example 4 - To a mixture of 75 g diacetone alcohol and 25 g methyl ethyl ketone is<br>
added 4 g polyvinylpyrrolidone (Kollidon 90, BASF Corp.), 2 g linear polyurethane<br>
polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.).<br>
To 10 g of the resulting solution was added 0.5g of a linear polyurethane<br>
polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.) and<br>
0.25g of alkyl hydroxyethyl dimethyl R ammonium chloride (R= C12) Preapagen HY<br>
(Clarient). The resulting solution was applied to a cleaned polyurethane slide by<br>
coating one side, air-dried and cured according to the sample preparation described<br>
above and leached in saline solution at room temperature for 0, 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28<br>
days. Significant growth was observed on the sample after 7 days of leaching and all<br>
following weeks with St. aureus under the conditions of the described microbial test<br>
method, but no growth or colonization respectively was observed after all leaching<br>
periods and exposure to E. coli organisms. Thus, the above composition showed<br>
extensive efficacy against Escherichia coli, but failed after 7 days against<br>
Staphylococcus aureus.<br><br>

Example 15 - The antimicrobial coating was prepared by mixing 48.0% methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, 13.0% tetrahydrofuran, 12.0% ethyl lactate, 25.0% of a 12% PVP solution in<br>
ethyl lactate and 2 g linear polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT<br>
Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.). To 10 g of the resulting solution was<br>
added 0.5g of a linear polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive<br>
34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.) and 0.125g of 3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyl-stearyl<br>
dimethyl ammonium chloride, (Quab 426 fromDegussa) and 0.125g of alkyl<br>
hydroxyethyl dimethyl -R- ammonium chloride (R= C12) (Preapagen HY from<br>
Clarient). The resulting solution was applied to a cleaned polyurethane slide by<br>
coating one side, air-dried and cured according to the sample preparation described<br>
above and leached in saline solution at room temperature according to the method<br>
mentioned above. No growth or colonization respectively was detected on the sample<br>
after all leaching periods up to 3 months with St.aureus and up to 6.5 months with E.<br>
coli individually tested under the conditions of the described microbial test.<br>
Example 16 - Example 15 was repeated with the same formulation and test sample<br>
preparation. Test organism tested was Streptococcus uberis. Leaching was in saline<br>
solution at room temperature according to the method mentioned above. No growth<br>
or colonization respectively was detected on the sample up to 56 days of leaching<br>
under the conditions of the described microbial test.<br>
Example 17 - (Comparative Example from Patent US 6,054,504) To a mixture of<br>
5 grams of a linear polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive<br><br>
34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc), 48.26 grams of methyl ethyl ketone and 0.26 grams<br>
of Hexetidine (Clariant LSM) was added 13.56 grams of tetrahydrofuran, 12.68 grams<br>
of ethyl lactate and 23.57 grams of a 12% PVP K90 solution in ethyl lactate (2.82<br>
grams polyvinylpyrrolidone). This solution was mixed and pipetted onto a<br>
polyurethane film, dried at room temperature for 10 minutes and cured in the oven<br>
between 60 and 70 °C for 45 minutes. These samples were then tested against<br>
bacterial growth of a gram-aegative bacteria, Escherichia coli, and two gram-positive<br>
bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermis. Films were tested<br>
after one day of leaching in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at room temperature.<br>
The results showed rampant bacteria growth for all three types of bacteria. This leads<br>
to the conclusion that using hexetidine as a covalently bonded antibacterial<br>
component is unsuccessful. Further leaching of the coating is unnecessary due to<br>
failure after 24 hours.<br>
Example 18 - The formulation of Example 15 was tested over extended period of<br>
time in a second set-up but under the same leaching conditions as before. Escherichia<br>
coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as test<br>
organisms. For over 3 months no colonization could be detected for all organisms on<br>
the treated surfaces whereas the controls showed growth.<br>
Example 19 - Stainless steel was prepared for testing an antimicrobial coating by<br>
applying an appropriate primer and cured for ten minutes at 80 °C. Then a second<br>
coat of a hydrophilic formulation cured for 12 hours at 80 °C was added on top of the<br>
primer. A third antimicrobial coating of the present invention was coated on top of<br>
the two coatings that was prepared as follows: To a compound of 5 grams of a linear<br>
polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer(NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic<br>
Surfaces, Inc.) was added 46.98 grams of methyl ethyl ketone, 13.20 grams of<br>
tetrahydrofuran, 12.34 grams ethyl lactate, 0.935 grams of Praepagen HY (Clariant),<br>
and 0.935 grams Quad 426 (Degussa). The stainless steel coating showed<br>
antimicrobial activity for at least two weeks.<br><br>
Example 20 - (Comparative example with non-bonding quat) An antimicrobial<br>
coating was prepared by mixing 48.0% methyl ethyl ketone, 13.0% tetrahydrofuran,<br>
12.0% ethyl lactate, 25.0% ethyl lactate-PVP solution and 2 g linear polyurethane<br>
polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.).<br>
To 10 g of the resulting solution was added 0.5g of a linear polyurethane<br>
polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.) and<br>
0.25g of Benzalkonium chloride (CAS # 63449-41-2). The resulting 'solution was<br>
applied to a cleaned polyurethane slide by coating one side, air-dried and cured<br>
according to the sample preparation described above and leached in saline solution at<br>
room temperature according to the method mentioned above. After leaching for three<br>
days in phosphate buffer solution at room temperature, this coating solution shows<br>
limited efficacy against Staphylococcus aureus. By GC analysis it was found that<br>
after 3 days of leaching a concentration of only 1 to 2 ppm of benzalkonium chloride<br>
could be detected, whereas after leaching for one day 300-400 ppm and after leaching<br>
for 2 days 5-10 ppm was detectable. The detection level of day 2 coincides with the<br>
MIC level for this quat of about 7.5ppm. The coating showed efficacy against E. coli<br>
for up to about 3 weeks with slight colonization after that time. St. aureus showed no<br>
growth of up to three days and had significant surface growth thereafter.<br>
Example 21 - An antimicrobial coating was prepared by mixing 48.0% methyl ethyl<br>
ketone, 13.0% tetrahydrofuran, 12.0% ethyl lactate, 25.0% ethyl lactate-PVP solution<br>
and 2 g linear polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2,<br>
Synthetic Surfaces, Inc.). To 10 g of the resulting solution was added 0.5g of a linear<br>
polyurethane polyisocyanate prepolymer (NORDOT Adhesive 34D-2, Synthetic<br>
Surfaces, Inc.), 1.0% Praepagen HY (Clariant), and 1.0% Quab 426 (Degussa, CAS #<br>
3001-63-6, CAS # 57-55-6, CAS # 7732-18-5). The resulting coating solution was<br>
applied to cleaned polyurethane sheets, air dried for 15 minutes at room temperature,<br>
cured at 80°C for one hour and allowed to react for an additional 24 hours at room<br>
temperature before any tests were performed. The coated polyurethane was then<br>
placed in an autoclave. The autoclave cycle conditions were 40 minutes at 121°C and<br>
15psi. This cycle was repeated six times. After each autoclave cycle, two pieces of<br>
polyurethane were cut from the coated and autoclaved sheet. The approximate size of<br><br>
the piece was one inch by one inch. One cut piece was used to test Escherichia coli<br>
and the other for Staphylococcus aureus. A 40l sample of bacteria was pipetted onto<br>
the surface of the coated, autoclaved polyurethane. The inoculated polyurethane was<br>
left in an incubator at 37°C for 24 hours before viewing for growth. The coated<br>
samples still had efficacy against E. coli and S. aureus through 6 cycles of autoclaving<br>
as the method for sterilization.<br>
Example 22 - 10.8 grams of polyvinylpyrrolidone/dimethylacrylic acid (ISP) were<br>
added to 48 grams of water and thoroughly mixed, pH was adjusted with 0. IN HCl to<br>
about 5 and the mix heated and kept at 70 °C for 1 hr. 1.2 grams of the quat QUAB<br>
426 was added, the mix stirred for 2 hrs and adjusted to pH 7 -with a 1N sodium<br>
hydroxide solution. 2.5% of this composition was incorporated together with 2.5%<br>
TWEEN 20 into a standard medical coating formulation according to example 2 of<br>
patent US patent 4,642,267 including a crosslinker. For making the standard medical<br>
coating, 47 g of water and 10 g N-methylpyrrolidone are added to 10 g of<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone (Kollidon 90, BASF Corp.), 33g of linear polyurethane aqueous<br>
dispersion (Neorez R940, Polyvinyl Chemical Industries) and 0.1g aziridine (CX100).<br>
Samples were prepared by coating 1"x2" polycarbonate pieces with the composition<br>
described above, cured at 100 °C for 1hr and tested for long term antimicrobial<br>
efficacy after leaching. The samples were leached in saline solution at room<br>
temperature according to the method mentioned above and exposed to the bacteria E.<br>
coli and St. aureus. No bacterial growth or bacterial colonization was detected after<br>
leaching for at least one week.<br>
Example 23 - A sample coated according to Example 15 was tested for its<br>
cytotoxicity potential by using Murine L929 fibroblast cells. The coated sample was<br>
soaked in media for 24hrs and then removed. Cells in that media survived whereas, in<br>
a control of a leaching biocide, the cells showed almost 100% necrosis.<br>
Example 24 - Polyurethane films were coated with the formula according to Example<br>
15 and tested for anticoagulation. An uncoated sample and coated samples according<br>
to Example 3 were used as control. Fresh titrated human whole blood was<br><br>
reactivated by adding calcium chloride (0.02M). 50l reactivated human blood was<br>
dropped on both coated and non-coated polyurethane facing up. The coated and<br>
uncoated polyurethane samples were put face up on a 10 cm slope with an angle of<br>
about 30 degrees. A drop of reactivated blood drop was put on each top part of the<br>
slope. On the non-coated control, as well as on the sample with a standard lubricious<br>
coating, the drop of blood did not move downwards but developed coagulation<br>
indicated by remaining at the spot where it was placed. The drop put on the<br>
antimicrobial sample coated according to the present Invention moved downwards by<br>
gravity. It continuously ran down reaching the bottom of the sample within 10<br>
minutes. The results show that the non-leaching antimicrobial polymeric coating<br>
composition according to the present invention when coated and cured on a<br>
polyurethane substrate does not cause coagulation on the coated substrate.<br>
Thus, while there has been disclosed what is presently believed to be preferred<br>

Surface-active, non-leaching antimicrobial film forming compositions and methods for their application to preferably<br>
medical device surfaces are provided. The compositions form durable coatings with long-lasting antimicrobial efficacy without<br>
formation of a zone of inhibition. Optionally the films can be hydrophilic. Specific long-chain molecules of certain chemical reactivity<br>
are covalently bonded into a polymeric matrix. They maintain a long-term anti-microbial efficacy without being leached out<br>
into the aqueous environment. The polymeric matrix of the compositions contain functional groups, which covalently bond to an<br>
amine, thiol, carboxyl, aldehyde or hydroxyl active group of selected long chain quaternary ammonium compounds. Upon formation<br>
of a covalent bonding with the polymeric matrix the long chain compounds become immobilized but still maintain antimicrobial<br>
efficacy. They do not leach out over extended period of time into the aqueous environment and maintain an anti-microbial efficacy<br>
against microorganisms. The coating is useful to prevent bacterial colonization on a variety of surface including surfaces of medical<br>
devices.</td>
