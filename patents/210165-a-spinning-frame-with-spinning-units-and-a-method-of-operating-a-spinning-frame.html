The invention relates to a spinning frame with a tube-shaped balloon limiter and to a method to produce yarn which such a frame, similar to the preambles of the corresponding independent claims.<br>
According to the general knowledge, thread tension and traveller wear are limiting factors for increasing the performance of ring spinning frames, since the forces acting on the thread balloon and on the traveller increase exponentially with the speed. Accordingly there is a tendency to produce smaller yarn bobbins which, however, has the disadvantage that the non-productive times of a spinning frame make up a higher proportion of the operating time.<br>
From the German patent applications DE 39 09 673, DE 196 25 940 or DE 197 05 872 it is known to apply tube-shaped balloon limiters in order to reduce the diameter of the thread balloon and thus also the thread tension. Furthermore, by means of the tube-shaped balloon limiter according to DE 196 25 940 with a cone-shaped design, a funnel-shaped air column is being generated which is supposed to result in a further reduction of the air resistance which the thread has to overcome and thus lead to a reduction of the thread tension. The balloon limiter has an inner diameter which in average is smaller than the yarn winding body, so that a division of the balloon limiter with operating elements is necessary in order to have better access to the single spinning units.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a spinning frame which can do without expensive supplemental devices and which makes a further performance increase possible.<br><br>
According to the invention this is made possible by the characteristic features of the independent claims. The depending claims relate to advantageous further embodiments.<br>
The spinning frame according to the invention is equipped with spinning units, each comprising a spindle with a spindle drive, a ring and a traveller rotating thereon as well as a guide enclosing said spindle. The ring, which is preferably being connected with the guide via the ring rail, is arranged shiftably along the axis of the spindle. While in conventional spinning frames at a certain speed of the spindle or at a certain speed of the traveller respectively, a yarn, with a yarn count and with a traveller mass adapted to said specific yarn count, can be produced, that is with value ranges for yarn counts, traveller mass and traveller speed corresponding according to the comparison chart in section 2.10 of the Bracker manual, of the edition dated up to 31.12.1995, with the title â€žWorld of Performance", with a spinning frame according to the invention in comparison with the conventional spinning frames according to the comparison chart of the mentioned manual, the traveller mass is being reduced by a divisor S2, and the speed range of the spindle drive is increased by the factor S. S can assume values of between 1 and 2.5 in particular between 1.5 and 2.5. This means that a spinning frame with ring diameters within the range of between 35 and 55 mm can do with travellers of a mass of only up to 50 mg, whereby, however the spindle drive can be laid out for operating speeds of up to 40'000 r.p.m.. The guide is preferably tube-shaped, which is being arranged on a ring rail, whereat the inner diameter of the guide is preferably larger than the ring diameter. The spinning rings can be T-type flange rings or slanted-type flange rings. The guide can also be a wire spiral concentrically arranged to the spindle.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail in the following according to the schematic drawings, wherein show:<br><br>
fig. 1	partially a cross section through a spinning unit with the basic spinning<br>
elements and<br>
fig. 2	a simplified outline of the arrangement in fig. 1 in a plan view of a<br>
spindle.<br>
In a spinning unit of a ring spinning frame a twist and winding device in the form of a spindle 20 is being arranged several times, whereof in figure 1 only one thread package 22 is being shown schematically which by means of a spindle 20 is being put into rotation. A traveller 14 on a ring 12 serves to guide the thread 30. By means of a ring rail 13 the ring 12 is being moved backwards and fonA^ards in direction of the axis of the spindle 20. A guide 16 in the form of a tube encloses the spinning unit, that means the spindle 20 and the ring 12, so that no free thread balloon 32, dotted line, can develop.<br>
According to the invention together with the guide 16 a traveller 14 is being used with a mass which is considerably smaller than the mass in conventional spinning frames. The traveller 14 can have a form which is being adapted to a T-type flange ring or a slanted-type flange ring.<br>
The following table shows the dimensions of the elements according to the invention in comparison to the ones of conventional frames.<br><br><br><br>
According to design i for instance, by applying a traveller mass of L1 = 10 mg with a ring diameter = 40 mm, a yarn with the count of Ne 60 at a spindle speed of N1 = 3O'OOO r.p.m. can be produced, which in a conventional spinning frame would lead to a collapse of the balloon and thus to a yarn break. The inner diameter of the guide is to be chosen in a size within the range of the ring diameter or up to 10 mm larger or within the range of the tube length, which can be sized up to 30 % longer or shorter.<br>
Other than for the formation of a free thread balloon 32 in a spinning frame without a guide 16, according to the invention the thread 30 contacts the inner wall of the guide or the tube 16 respectively, in the form of a thread spiral 36, whereat only a short thread section between the traveller 14 and the starting-up point P on the tube 16 is freely tensioned. Above this the thread 30 places itself against the inner wall surface of the tube 16 in the form of a spiral. Figure 1 shows the developed view 38 of such a thread spiral on the inner circumference of the tube 16. For comparison a second developed view 34 of a thread at a spinning unit without guide 16 is being illustrated or the projection of the thread balloon 32 onto the surface of the tube 16 respectively, whereat the thread path of the free balloon 32 is considerably steeper than in the thread spiral 36.<br>
The drive 20' of the spindle is preferably an electric motor.<br>
The thread spiral 36 or 38 respectively can extend over more than 360Â° circumferential angle on the inner wall surface of the tube-shaped guide 16.<br>
In figure 2, from outside to inside at first the circumference of the guide 16 can be recognised, further the thread spiral 36 contacting its inner side, which spiral is being<br><br>
diverted inward by the traveller 14 on its running path 12', so that between the traveller 14 and the thread package or cop 22 a straight thread section 39 results.<br>
The turning direction of the rotating parts in the arrangement in figure 2 or 3 respectively is counter clockwise according to the arrows indicated.<br>
In a spinning frame according to the invention, despite considerably higher traveller speed, a basically unchanged force characteristic results in comparison with conventional spinning frames, actually when producing similar yarns, since the centrifugal force Z, which is proportional to the traveller mass and to the square of the traveller speed, remains constant, if the traveller mass is being reduced by an arbitrary divisor S^ and if at the same time the speed is increased by the factor S.<br>
The basic characteristic feature of the invention thus is, that with the application of a guide 16 enclosing the spindle a considerable performance increase by increasing the speed can only be achieved if at the same time lighter travellers are being furnished.<br>
The guide 16, preferably laid out as a tube, is to be arranged at a distance to the ring, that is above the ring. For threading purposes the guide 16 has to be slotted.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention the thread 30 is being led downward on the outside of the tube 16. In this case the ring or the traveller respectively, can be omitted. It can be of advantage if the tube 16 is rotatably mounted or if it is furnished with a drive respectively which allows a circumferential speed of the tube 16 corresponding with the speed of a traveller 14 on a ring 12.<br><br>
