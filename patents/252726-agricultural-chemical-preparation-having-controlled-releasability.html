which a large amount of an agricultural chemical active ingredient is released in a short<br>
period of time immediately after agricultural chemical treatment, namely the<br>
phenomenon in which the initial burst is inhibited and the agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient which should inherently be released remains without the entire amount being<br>
released, or in other words, dead stock, residual efficacy can be maintained, the problem<br>
of an increased amount of agricultural chemical active ingredient remaining in the crop<br>
or causing chemical damage can be solved, and the agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient can be prevented from remaining in the environment. In addition, an<br>
agricultural chemical formulation of the present invention, in addition to the effects<br>

methacrylic acid ester, and impact-resistant (meth)acrylic resins, in which butadiene,<br>
styrene or acrylonitrile has been copolymerized with (meth)acrylic acid ester.<br>
Specific examples of polystyrene-based resins include styrene homopolymers that<br>
are typically used as molding resins, as well as high-impact polystyrene (HIPS), methyl<br>
methacrylate-butadiene-styrene copolymer, styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer,<br><br><br>

polyethylene terephthalate, polypropylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate,<br>
and polyesters obtained by condensation of diols and carboxylic acid that are used in<br>
coating resins and so forth. Particularly preferable examples include aliphatic<br>
polyesters obtained by condensation polymerization of an aliphatic diol and<br>
dicarboxylic acid.<br>
In particular, examples of polyester-based resins include biodegradable resins<br>
such as polyhydroxyalkanoate copolymers represented by 3-hydroxybutyrate •<br>
3-hydroxyvalerate copolymers, homopolymers consisting only of hydroxyalkanoate<br>

and polyester.<br>
Specific examples of polyvinyl chloride-based resins include vinyl chloride<br>
homopolymers, and copolymers of vinyl chloride and ethylene, propylene, acrylonitrile,<br>
vinylidene chloride and vinyl acetate, respectively. <br>
Among these resins, rosin derivatives or polymer derivatives having repeating<br>
units derived from salicylic acid are particularly preferable in consideration of<br>
compatibility with agricultural chemical active ingredients and control of release.<br>
Rosin derivatives refer to abietic acid, which is the main component of pine tar,<br>
and its derivatives, specific examples of which include tall rosin, rosin-modified phenol<br>
and rosin-modified maleic acid.<br>
Polymers having repeating units derived from salicylic acid or its derivatives may<br>
include other structures as repeating units provided they contain salicylic acid or its<br>
derivatives as repeating units within the polymer, specific examples of which include<br><br><br>
polymers in which two or more molecules of salicylic acid, which may be the same or<br>
of two or more types, are condensed, and polymers in which salicylic acid and another<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acid are condensed. A more specific example is the linear<br>
polysalicylate produced by PROVIRON.<br>
The specific mixing ratio of the synthetic resins used is preferably within the<br>
range of 30 to 99% by weight of styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer and 1 to 70% by<br>
weight of a copolymer having repeating units derived from rosin or its derivatives or<br>
from salicylic acid or its derivatives, and more preferably, within the range of 50 to 99%<br>
by weight of the former and 1 to 50% by weight of the latter (these resins may also be<br>
referred to as poorly water-soluble resins).<br>
The hydrophobically-treated silicon oxide used in the present invention refers to<br>
that in which hydrophilic silanol groups (Si-OH) on the surface of the silicon oxide are<br>
hydrophobically treated by chemical modification, heat treatment and so forth. In the<br>
present invention, hydrophobic treatment should be performed at least on the surface of<br>
the silicon oxide, and although all of the silanol groups inside the silicon oxide may be<br>
hydrophobically treated, preferably only the surface is hydrophobically treated. <br>
There are no particular limitations on the method of hydrophobic treatment, and<br>
specific examples include hydrophobic treatment using silicone oil, and alkylation of<br>
the silanol groups, and alkyl groups having 1 to 30 carbon atoms are preferable.<br>
Specific examples of surface hydrophobic groups include (CH3)3Si-, (CH3)2Si-,<br>
(-Si(CH3)2-O-)n and C8H17Si-. In addition, hydrophobic silicon dioxide and so forth<br>
used in the present invention is preferably in the form of extremely minute, amorphous<br>
particles having a primary particle mean particle size of 0.5 to 100 nm. Specific<br>
examples of hydrophobic silicon dioxide include baked white carbon and hydrophobic<br><br><br>
white carbon, and more specifically, products such as Sipernat D17 (Degussa, registered<br>
trademark) and Aerosil R972 (Aerosil, registered trademark).<br>
An agricultural chemical-containing resin composition of the present invention is<br>
characterized by a composition containing the aforementioned (1) agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient, (2) styrene-maleic anhydride copolymer or mixture of styrene-maleic<br>
acid copolymer and a polymer having repeating units derived from rosin or derivative<br>
thereof or salicylic acid or derivative thereof, and (3) hydrophobically-treated silicon<br>
oxide, forming a compatible state or matrix. A compatible state or matrix refers to a<br>
state in which an agricultural chemical active ingredient is dissolved or dispersed in a<br>
non-discontinuous (continuous phase) poorly water-soluble resin. The mixing ratio of<br>
each component is arbitrarily set to maximize gradual release of the agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient, and although there are no particular limitations on this ratio,<br>
the agricultural chemical active ingredient is preferably within the range of 1 to 80% by<br>
weight, the poorly water-soluble resin 19 to 98% by weight, and the hydrophobic silicon<br>
oxide and so forth 1 to 80% by weight, and more preferably the agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient is within the range of 10 to 50% by weight, the poorly water-soluble<br>
resin 45 to 85% by weight, and the hydrophobic silicon oxide and so forth 5 to 50% by<br>
weight.<br>
There are no particular restrictions on the production process of an agricultural<br>
chemical-containing resin composition of the present invention provided it allows the<br>
formation of a compatible state or matrix, specific examples of which include a<br>
production process having a step in which an agricultural chemical active ingredient,<br>
poorly water-soluble resin and hydrophobically- treated silicon oxide are mixed, melted<br>
by heating, kneaded and cooled (to also be referred to as a melting method), or a step in<br><br><br>
which an agricultural chemical active ingredient, poorly water-soluble resin and<br>
hydrophobically-treated silicon oxide are dissolved, dispersed and mixed in an organic<br>
solvent followed by distilling off the organic solvent (to also be referred to as a solvent<br>
method), or a step in which a poorly water-soluble resin is dissolved in an aqueous<br>
alkaline solution, and an agricultural chemical active ingredient and<br>
hydrophobically-treated silicon oxide are added, dissolved, dispersed and mixed, and<br>
the pH value of this mixed solution are changed to acidic by hydrogen chloride to obtain<br>
precipitation followed by filtration and drying (to also be referred to as a pH<br>
precipitation method), or a fine granulation step.<br>
Specific examples of melting methods include a method in which a poorly<br>
water-soluble resin is placed in a kneader and melted by heating followed by<br>
respectively adding an agricultural chemical active ingredient and hydrophobically-<br>
treated silicon oxide, melting and kneading, and then extruding with a single screw or<br>
double screw extruder and forming into pellets with a pelletizer, followed by<br>
pulverizing the resulting pellets and placing in a crusher to form into fine particles; and<br>
a method in which a mixture of an agricultural chemical active ingredient, poorly<br>
water-soluble resin and hydrophobically-treated silicon oxide and so forth is heated,<br>
melted and kneaded in a heated, continuous kneader, and the resulting kneaded product<br>
is cooled and broken up followed by crushing to form fine particles.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the melting temperature in the melting<br>
 method provided the agricultural chemical active ingredient is not decomposed and<br>
 adequately melts or uniformly mixes with the resin. In addition, in the melting method,<br><br>
 although it is desirable to produce the agricultural chemical-containing resin<br>
composition in a short period of time and use as low a temperature as possible to heat<br><br><br>
and melt the resin to avoid decomposition of the agricultural chemical active ingredient<br>
by heat, since there are cases in which it is difficult to obtain a dissolved or uniformly<br>
mixed resin even if adequately stirred due to viscosity increasing at low temperatures,<br>
there are cases in which a uniform composition can be obtained even in a highly viscous<br>
state by adding a surfactant.<br>
A specific example of a solvent method includes placing a solvent in a container<br>
that allows distillation under reduced pressure, respectively adding a poorly<br>
water-soluble resin and agricultural chemical active ingredient, completely dissolving<br>
the resin and agricultural chemical active ingredient by heating and stirring, adding<br>
hydrophobically- treated silicon oxide and so forth and dispersing or dissolving,<br>
followed by completely distilling off the solvent by heating and concentrating under<br>
reduced pressure, and applying the resulting powder to a crusher to form fine particles.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the solvent used in the solvent method<br>
provided it dissolves the resin and agricultural chemical active ingredient used and<br>
allows them to be stable therein, specific examples of which include aromatic or<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, toluene, alkyl naphthalene, phenylxylylethane,<br>
kerosene, gas oil, hexane and cyclohexane, halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
chlorobenzene, dichloromethane, dichloroethane and trichloroethane, alcohols such as<br>
methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, hexanol and ethylene glycol, ethers such<br>
as diethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, esters such<br>
as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate, ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl<br>
isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone, nitriles such as acetonitrile and isobutyronitrile,<br>
acid amides such as dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethylformamide and<br>
N,N-dimethylacetamide, an vegetable oils such as soybean oil and cottonseed oil.<br><br><br>
Particularly preferable examples include dichloromethane, acetone and methanol.<br>
Moreover, although there are no particular limitations on the mixing ratio of<br>
solvent and poorly water-soluble resin provided the amount of solvent is able to<br>
dissolve the agricultural chemical active ingredient and poorly water-soluble resin, it is<br>
preferably within the range of 10 to 20% by weight. Although it is desirable to<br>
dissolve using as little solvent as possible since costs are not wasted on distilling off the<br>
excess solvent, since there are cases in which it is difficult to obtain a dissolved or<br>
uniformly mixed resin by stirring due to viscosity increasing with a small amount of<br>
solvent, there are cases in which a uniform composition can be obtained even in a<br>
highly viscous state by adding a surfactant. The temperature at which the agricultural<br>
chemical active ingredient and resin are dissolved is preferably 20 to 40°C to maintain<br>
the stability of the agricultural chemical active ingredient.<br>
Although an ordinary method can be used to distill off the solvent, specific<br>
examples include vacuum distillation, heated distillation and heated vacuum distillation.<br>
In addition, examples of other methods that can be used include a method in which a<br>
second solvent in which the resin and agricultural chemical active ingredient are<br>
insoluble is added, and the precipitated solid matter is filtered, and a method in which a<br>
spray-drying granulator is used.<br>
In the melting and solvent methods, the order in which agricultural chemical<br>
active ingredient, poorly water-soluble resin and hydrophobic silicon oxide are melted<br>
or dissolved may be simultaneous or in any order, they may be melted or dissolved over<br>
the course of several times, or the melting and solvent methods may be used in<br>
combination according to the composition.<br>
A specific example of a pH precipitation method includes completely dissolving a<br><br><br>
poorly water-soluble resin and agricultural chemical active ingredient in an ammonia<br>
solution, and after adding and dispersing hydrophobic silicon oxide and so forth,<br>
hydrochloric acid is added to form an acidic solution. The resulting precipitate is then<br>
filtered and dried, and the resulting powder is applied to a crusher to form fine particles.<br>
A pulverizer used for extrusion-molded granules or a pin mill or jet mill crusher<br>
used for wettable powders can be used for the pulverizing and granulation methods of<br>
the present formulation even in the case of agricultural chemical-containing resin<br>
compositions produced by any method. In addition, in the case of producing an<br>
agricultural chemical-containing resin composition using the solvent method, in<br>
addition to the methods described above, distilling off the solvent and fine particle<br>
formation can be carried out simultaneously using a spray-drying granulator.<br>
There are no particular limitations on the release control agent provided it is able<br>
to promote or suppress the amount of agricultural chemical active ingredient eluted<br>
from a compatible state or matrix, and control that release, specific examples of which<br>
include water-soluble polymers, silicon oxide and surfactants.<br>
Specific examples of water-soluble polymers include naturally-occurring<br>
water-soluble polymers such as starch and gelatin, semi-synthetic cellulose derivatives<br>
such as carboxymethyl cellulose, methyl cellulose and propoxypropyl cellulose, and<br>
synthetic water-soluble polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylic acid-based<br>
polymers, polyacrylamide and polyethylene glycol.<br>
A specific example of a silicon oxide is white carbon. More specifically,<br>
examples of white carbon include ordinary white carbon, baked white carbon and<br>
hydrophobic white carbon. Ordinary white carbon refers to the generic term for<br>
amorphous silicon dioxide composed of SiO2, and is classified as precipitation method<br><br><br>
silica or fumed silica according to differences in the production process. Baked white<br>
carbon refers to white carbon in which the surface silanol groups have been made to be<br>
hydrophobic by treating ordinary white carbon at a high temperature, while<br>
hydrophobic white carbon refers to that previous described. In order to control the<br>
release of agricultural chemical active ingredient, or eliminate segregation caused by<br>
settling and segregation by uniformly dispersing in a solvent, hydrophobic white carbon<br>
is used particularly preferably, specific examples of which include those previously<br>
described.<br>

necessary to an agricultural chemical formulation of the present invention.<br>
Although there are no particular limitations on the mean particle size of an<br>
agricultural chemical formulation of the present invention, and varies according to the<br>
purpose of use, a range of 200 µm or less is preferable, while a range of 1 to 100 urn is<br>
particularly preferable, for use as a formulation base material, seed powdered coating or<br>
powder. In addition, the release rate of the agricultural chemical active ingredient can<br>
be adjusted by using two or more types of an agricultural chemical formulation of the<br>
present invention having different particle sizes and compositions in combination.<br><br><br>
In addition, in the case active ingredients of an agricultural chemical become<br>
unstable upon contact, or agricultural chemical active ingredients having considerably<br>
differences in physical properties are mixed into a formulation, mixture can be produced<br>
that is ordinarily considered to be difficult by preparing a formulation of the present<br>
invention for each agricultural chemical active ingredient followed by mixing into a<br>
formulation.<br>
In addition, active ingredients of other fungicides and insecticides can be mixed<br>
and formulated with a formulation of the present invention (mixture), other fungicides<br>
and insecticides can be mixed and used with a formulation of the present invention<br>
(tank mixing) or the spraying times can be interchanged for (sequential) treatment in<br>
order to expand the scope of application to biological effects.<br>
There are no particular limitations on active ingredients that can be used in mixed<br>
formulations, tank mixing or sequential treatment provided they are registered<br>
agricultural chemicals, and specific examples include the same active ingredients that<br>
were previously listed. Particularly preferable examples include pyrethroid<br>

produced according to production processes typically used in the production of<br>
agricultural chemical formulation by using an agricultural chemical-containing resin<br>
composition of the present invention as a base material. As a specific example, these<br>
can be produced by adding a formulation base material such as a surfactant or carrier to<br>
an agricultural chemical-containing resin composition prior to pulverizing and crushing<br>
followed by pulverizing, crushing and granulation.<br>
An agricultural chemical formulation of the present invention is able to treat both<br>
arable land and non-arable land. Seed treatment formulation can be applied by<br>
spraying treatment, dust coating, sprinkling treatment or immersion treatment onto seed<br>
potatoes and so forth, post-emergence formulation can be applied by sprinkling<br>
treatment or top dressing treatment, soil treatment formulation can be applied by surface<br>
sprinkling treatment, soil incorporation, soil drench, soil fumigation, pricking-in hole<br>
treatment, plant foot treatment, row treatment, seeding furrow treatment, seeding box<br>
treatment or seedling pot treatment, paddy treatment agents can be applied by granule<br>
application, jumbo granule application or fiowable application, and other treatment<br>
agents can be applied by space fumigation or lawn treatment. Among these, an<br>
agricultural chemical formulation of the present invention is preferably used as a seed<br>
treatment formulation or soil treatment formulation.<br>
A seed treatment agent can be applied by, for example, dissolving and dispersing<br>
a formulation in a sticker solution (solution in which a water-soluble polymer such as<br><br><br>
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and a dye to serve as a<br>
marker for chemical treatment are dissolved in water so as to facilitate adhesion during<br>
seed treatment), mixing this solution or dispersion with the crop seeds and drying to<br>
prepare seed to which the chemical is uniformly adhered. When these seeds are<br>
normally planted in soil, the chemical absorbed through the seeds themselves or through<br>
the roots that have sprouted from the seeds spreads throughout the entire plant, thereby<br>
protecting the plant from illness and pests.<br>
A soil treatment agent can be applied by, for example, by normally seeding or<br>
planting and treating with a formulation diluted with water with a sprinkler or watering<br>
pot from above either before or after covering with soil, or by treating young seedlings<br>
grown in seedling planters or seedling cells with a formulation diluted with water using<br>
a sprinkler or watering pot. In the case of treating by using these methods, the<br>
chemical is absorbed from the roots of a germinated plant thereby protecting the crop<br>
from illness and pests in the same manner as seed treatment.<br>
Moreover, an agricultural chemical-containing resin composition of the present<br>
invention can also be used for an application selected from the group consisting of<br>
pharmaceuticals, veterinary medicines, food preservatives and biocides in addition to<br>
agricultural applications, specific examples of which include applications selected from<br>
the group consisting of soil pest extermination agents, termite extermination agents,<br>
clothing agents, pest extermination agents, wood pest extermination agents, bait agents,<br>
animal external parasite extermination agents, sanitary pest extermination agents, home<br>
disinfectants, marine vessel bottom coatings, fishing net and others algae prevention<br>
agents, and wood and others mildew-proofing agents.<br>
Although the following provides a more detailed explanation of the present<br><br><br>
invention through its examples, the scope of the present invention is not limited to these<br>
examples.<br>

The majority of the solvent was distilled off from this solution with an evaporator<br>
followed by additionally drying for 2 hours at 40°C with a vacuum dryer to obtain a<br>

Co.) instead of SMA17352.<br>
Comparative Example 4<br>
A fine particle composition having a mean particle size of 88 urn was obtained by<br>
carrying out the same method as Example 17 with the exception of using polyethylene<br>
(molecular weight: 4000, Sigma-Aldrich) instead of SMA17352.<br>
Comparative Example 5<br>
72.3 g of acetamiprid, 2.5 of NEWKALGEN RX-B (sodium lignin sulfonate,<br>
Takemoto Oil &amp; Fat), 20.2 g of clay and 5.0 g of Carplex #80 (white carbon, Shionogi<br>
&amp; Co.) were mixed well in a mortar followed by pulverizing with a jet mil to obtain a<br>
wettable powder containing 70% by weight of acetamiprid.<br>
Example 26<br>
Test Example 1 - Water Dissolution Test<br>
Samples of the fine particle compositions, their wettable powders and granules<br>
obtained in Examples 1 to 14 and Examples 17 to 24 along with wettable powder<br>
containing 70% by weight of acetamiprid, each containing about 10 mg of acetamiprid<br>
active ingredient, were accurately weighed out into 100 ml vials followed by the<br>
addition of 80 ml of distilled water at 25°C and 20 ml of an internal standard in the form<br>
of aqueous methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate solution (500 mg/L distilled water), covering,<br>
inverting five times and allowing to stand undisturbed until the time of sampling in a<br><br><br>
constant temperature bath at 25°C. In cases in which the sample was not in the form<br>
of a wettable powder, a surfactant mixture (composed of a pulverized mixture of 30%<br>
by weight of each surfactant and 70% by weight of clay) equal to 10% by weight of the<br>
weighed value obtained after weighing the samples was added and mixed well followed<br>
by adding distilled water and internal standard and dispersing therein. Roughly 0.7 ml<br>
aliquots were sampled predetermined time after inverting five times prior to sampling<br>
(and filtering with a 0.45 µm filter). The concentrations of acetamiprid in the sampled<br>
solutions were measured by HPLC to determine the acetamiprid concentration in water,<br>
and the water dissolution rate was calculated as a percentage of the acetamiprid<br>
concentration in the case the acetamiprid added to the water had completely dissolved in<br>
the water. Since different types of active ingredients are used in Examples 15 and 16,<br>
the active ingredient concentration in water was analyzed without using an internal<br>
standard. Those results are shown in Table 1. In Table 1, in contrast to the water<br>
dissolution rate of the 70% by weight acetamiprid wettable powder used for the control<br>
being 100% after 15 minutes, the water dissolution rates of the fine particle<br>
compositions and their wettable powders of each example were controlled to a low level.<br>
In addition, the fine powder compositions of Comparative Examples 1,2 and 4<br>
demonstrated high water dissolution rates after 15 minutes (initial burst), and<br>
subsequent increases in water dissolution rates were not observed for Comparative<br>
Examples 1 and 2, thereby resulting in dead stock. Although the water dissolution rate<br>
of the fine particle composition of Comparative Example 3 was held to a low level after<br>
15 minutes, an increase in its water dissolution rate was no longer observed starting at<br>
72 hours, thus resulting in dead stock in this case as well.<br><br><br><br>
—: Not measured<br>
On the basis of these results, the release rates of acetamiprid in water of the fine<br>
particle compositions and their wettable powders of Examples 1 to 14 and 17 to 23 were<br>
observed to be controlled to a low level and increase over time without generating dead<br>
stock. In addition, similar trends were demonstrated by the fine particle compositions<br><br>
of Examples 15 and 16 that used an active ingredient ingredient other than acetamiprid.<br>
Moreover, the addition of a release controller in the form of hydrophobic white carbon<br>
or water-soluble polymer, and altering the mean particle size of the fine particle<br>
compositions were determined to allow control of the release rate.<br>
Example 27<br>
Test Example 2 - Soil Stability Test<br>
The wettable powders obtained in Examples 19 to 21 were uniformly mixed into<br>
soil so that 1 mg of acetamiprid was mixed for every 10 g of soil. The soil mixtures<br>
were stored in a constant temperature bath at a temperature of 25°C and relative<br>
humidity of 90%, samples were taken at predetermined times and the acetamiprid in the<br>
soil was extracted with solvent and analyzed by HPLC to calculate the residual<br>
percentage of acetamiprid relative to the initial amount.<br>
A similar test was carried out on the wettable powder containing 70% by weight<br>
of acetamiprid of Comparative Example 5 to measure soil stability (residual percentage).<br>
Those results are shown in Table 2. In Table 2, the half-life in the soil refers to the<br>
amount of time (number of days) required for the amount of acetamiprid initially mixed<br>
into the soil to decrease to half that amount under the test conditions.<br><br>
According to Table 2, the half-lives in the soil of acetamiprid in wettable powders<br>
1, 2 and 3 were longer than the half-life in the soil of acetamiprid in the 70wt%<br><br>
acetamiprid wettable powder, thus demonstrating that wettable powders 1, 2 and 3 have<br>
high soil stability.<br>
Example 28<br>
Test Example 3 - Test of Use as a Seed Treatment Agent<br>
Wettable powders 1 to 3 obtained in Examples 19 to 21 were dispersed in 3 ml of<br>

GL05S, Nippon Synthetic Chemical) and 1% by weight of a surfactant in the form of<br>
sodium lignin sulfonate (NEWKALGEN RX-B, Takemoto Oil &amp; Fat) were dissolved in<br>
94% by weight of water, so as to contain 70 mg of acetamiprid, 0.3 ml of this dispersion<br>
were placed in a vinyl bag provided with a zipper containing 20 g of wheat seeds<br>
(Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries No. 61), immediately after which the<br>
zipper was closed followed by mixing by shaking vigorously for 30 seconds to adhere<br>
the chemical to the wheat seeds. The seeds were then spread out in a thin layer in a vat<br>
and air-dried overnight at room temperature to obtain wheat seeds adhered with 35 g of<br>
acetamiprid per 100 kg of seeds. The resulting seeds were planted in a No. 2 unglazed<br>
flower pot containing Kuroboku soil followed by inoculating with adults and larva of 20<br>
wheat aphids per plant 23 days (or 40 days) later. The number of parasites was<br>
counted at 2, 4 and 7 days after inoculation to evaluate residual efficacy. For the<br>
control, similar tests were carried out in the case of using the 70% by weight<br>
acetamiprid wettable powder of Comparative Example 5 and in the case of<br>
non-treatment. Those results are shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
According to Table 3, the efficacy of the agricultural chemical active ingredient of<br>
wettable powders 1, 2 and 3 persisted longer than that of the wettable powder<br>
containing 70% by weight acetamiprid of Comparative Example 5.<br>

sprinkling planting rows with 18.5 g of wettable powder per 100 m of seeding troughs<br>
from above the seed potatoes during planting of seed potatoes. Chemical effects were<br>
evaluated by investigating the number of adult and larval Colorado potato beetles that<br>
grew in the potatoes 44 days after planting. A treated area in which wettable powder<br>
containing 70% by weight of the same active ingredient in the form of acetamiprid was<br>
used, and an untreated area, were used as controls. Those results are shown in Table 4.<br><br><br>
According to Table 4, wettable powders 1 and 2 were determined to demonstrated<br>
improved control effects in the field as compared with the wettable powder containing<br>
70% by weight acetamiprid of Comparative Example 5.<br>

Test Example 5 - Test of Use as a Seed Treatment Agent by<br>
Combining with Synthetic Pyrethroids<br>
Wettable powder 2 obtained in Example 20 was dispersed in 2.8 ml of a solution<br>
(sticker solution), in which 5% by weight of polyvinyl alcohol (Gohsenol GL05S,<br>
Nippon Synthetic Chemical) and 1% by weight of a surfactant in the form of sodium<br>
lignin sulfonate (NEWKALGEN RX-B, Takemoto Oil &amp; Fat) were dissolved in 94% by<br>
weight of water, so as to contain 400 mg of acetamiprid, 0.35 ml of this dispersion were<br>
placed in a vinyl bag provided with a zipper containing 8 g of rapeseed seeds,<br>
immediately after which the zipper was closed followed by mixing by shaking<br>
vigorously for 30 seconds to adhere the chemical to the rapeseed seeds. The seeds<br>
were then spread out in a thin layer in a vat and air-dried overnight at room temperature<br>
to obtain rapeseed seeds adhered with 500 g of acetamiprid per 100 kg of seeds.<br>
1 g of cypermethrin wettable powder (active ingredient: 6% by weight) was<br>
dispersed in 1.3 ml of distilled water, and 0.65 ml of this dispersion (20 mg as<br>
cypermethrin) were placed in a vinyl bag provided with a zipper containing 8 g of<br><br>
rapeseed seeds adhered with 500 g of acetamiprid per 100 kg of seeds, immediately<br>
after which the zipper was closed followed by mixing by shaking vigorously for 30<br>
seconds to adhere the chemical to the rapeseed seeds. The seeds were then spread out<br>
in a thin layer in a vat and air-dried for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature followed by<br>
again placing in a vinyl bag provided with a zipper, adding 0.65 ml of the<br>
aforementioned dispersion and repeating the same procedure. These seeds were then<br>
spread out in a thin layer in a vat followed by allowing to air dry overnight at room<br>
temperature to obtain rapeseed seeds adhered with 500 g of cypermethrin and 500 g of<br>
acetamiprid per 100 kg of seeds.<br>
In addition, wettable powder 2 obtained in Example 20 was dispersed in 1.1 g of<br>
bifenthrin SC (active ingredient: 7.2% by weight) so as to contain 80 mg of acetamiprid,<br>
and 0.55 ml of this dispersion (40 mg as bifenthrin and 40 mg of acetamiprid) were<br>
placed in a vinyl bag provided with a zipper containing 8 g of rapeseed seeds, followed<br>
immediately by mixing by shaking vigorously for 30 seconds to adhere the chemical to<br>
the seeds. The seeds were then spread out in a thin layer in a vat and air-dried<br>
overnight at room temperature to obtain rapeseed seeds adhered with 500 g of bifenthrin<br>
and 500 g of acetamiprid per 100 kg of seeds.<br>
The resulting seeds were planted in a No. 2 flower pot containing alluvial soil and<br>
cultivated in a greenhouse. Eighteen days after seeding, rapeseed seedlings were<br>
transferred to a cage in which 100 adult yellow striped flea beetles had been released,<br>
and after allowing to stand for 3 days, the number of plant damage scars caused by the<br>
adult yellow striped flea beetles was counted for three plants in each test group. For<br>
the control, similar tests were carried out in the case of treating with 500 g of wettable<br>
powder 2, cypermethrin or bifenthrin alone per 100 kg of seeds, and in the case of<br><br><br>
non-treatment. Those results are shown in Table 5. Control rate (%) = ((no. of scars<br>
of untreated group - no. of scars of treated group)/(no. of scars of untreated group)) X<br>
100.<br><br>
According to Table 5, the combined use of wettable powder 2 with the synthetic<br>
pyrethroids cypermethrm or bifenthrin was determined to demonstrate higher control<br>
effects against yellow striped flea beetles than treating with wettable powder 2 alone,<br>
and synergistic effects were observed between wettable powder 2 and synthetic<br>
pyrethroids.<br>

termite control effects during soil treatment as compared with the water-dispersible<br>
power containing 70% by weight acetamiprid of Comparative Example 5.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
As has been described above, since the use of an agricultural chemical<br>
formulation of the present invention makes it possible to inhibit the phenomenon in<br>
which a large amount of an agricultural chemical active ingredient is released in a short<br>
period of time immediately after agricultural chemical treatment, namely the<br>
phenomenon in which the initial burst is inhibited and the agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient which should inherently be released remains without the entire amount being<br>
released, or in other words, dead stock, residual efficacy can be maintained, the problem<br>
of an increased amount of agricultural chemical active ingredient remaining in the crop<br>
or causing chemical damage can be solved, and the agricultural chemical active<br>
ingredient can be prevented from remaining in the environment. In addition, an<br>
agricultural chemical formulation of the present invention, in addition to the effects<br>
described above, also improves light stability, controls dispersivity, has the effects of<br>
improving residual efficacy of the agricultural chemical active ingredient and reducing<br>
loss into the environment by improving rain resistance, and has effects such as reducing<br>
the total amount of agricultural chemical sprayed, reducing the number of sprayings,<br>
and reducing toxicity to the sprayer, and is particularly useful as a seed treatment agent<br>
and soil treatment agent.<br><br><br>
