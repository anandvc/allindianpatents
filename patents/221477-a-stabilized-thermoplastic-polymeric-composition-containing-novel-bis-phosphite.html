				<td>The   present  invention  relates   to  a   stabilized   thermoplastic  polymeric containing novel bis phophite.<br>
1.       Field of the Invention<br>
This invention concerns certain novel bis-cyclic phosphate compounds and polymeric materials stabilized therewith. More specifically, this invention concerns certain cyclic bis-phosphites, derived from, for example, 4,4'-6J6'-tetra-tert-butyl-2,2'-biphenol or 2,2'-methylene-bis-(4,6-di-tert-butylphenol s well as homologues thereof, and the corresponding chlorophosphite derivative of 1,3-glycol. This invention also includes polymeric materials and articles made from polymeric materials that are stabilized against thermally-induced oxidative degradation by the presence therein of at least one of the cyclic bis-phosphites.<br>
2.       Description of the Prior Art<br>
Synthetic polymeric materials such as polyamides, polyesters, polystyrenes, and polyolefins, particularly polypropylene, require stabilization against thermal degradation to prevent significant changes<br>
in the properties of the polymeric material during melt processing. For example,without adequate stabilization, the melt- flow rate of polypropylene changes significantly during its extrusion in the compounding of various formulations and products. Various cyclic phosphates and the use thereof in polyolefins are well known. See, for example, U,S. Pat Nos. 3,441,633; 3,46,733; 3,488,407; 3,714302; 4,252,750; 4,673,701; 4,956,406 and 5,594,053 as well as EP 0 635 511 Al. The novel cyclic phosphates provided by our invention are non volatile and are effective process stabilizers for polymeric materials. Moreover, the phosphates of the present invention have lower melting points than the corresponding phosphates substituted in 4,4' positions of the bis-aromatic rings.<br>

radiation, or a combination of heat and radiation;<br>
(b)	.001 to 5.0 weight percent by weight of an amount of a cyclic bis-<br>
phosphite effective to reduce the degradation of the polymeric material<br>
upon exposure to heat, radiation, or a combination of heat, radiation, Heat, radiation, wherein the cyclic bis phosphite has the formula:<br><br>
 (FormulaRemoved)<br>
wherein each R1 and R2 is independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl radicals of from 1 to about 17 carbon atoms, or whereinRl and R2 are connected to form a five-mernbered, six-memberedf or seven-membered cycloalkyl ring or substituted five-membered, substituted six-membered, or substituted seven-membered cycloalkyl ring, and R3 is an alkylidene radial of from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms or a direct carbon to carbon bond; and the balance if any comprising<br>
(c )      a hindered phenol compound; and/ or<br>
(d)	calcium stearate, and/or<br>
(e)	conventional additives<br>
The composition of the present invention is neither a. mere admixture nor a product of a chemical process but a synergistic mixture.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The  novel  cyclic  bis-phosphites  provided  by our invention  are  effective hydrolytic and thermal stabilizers for polymeric materials,<br>
The cyclic bis-phosphite is a compound of the formula (1):<br>
wherein each R1 and R2 is independently selected from hydrogen, alkyl radicals of from 1 to about 17 carbon atoms, or whereinRl and R2 arc connected to form a five-membered, six-membered, or seven-rnembered cycloalkyl ring or substituted five-membered, substituted six-membered, or substituted seven-membered cycloalkyl ring, and R3 is an alkylidene radial of from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms or a direct carbon to carbon bond; and<br>

Briefly, a method of preparing the cyclic bis-phosphite compounds of<br>
formula I comprises reacting a chlorophosphite having the formula (II)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1 and R2 are defined above, with bis-phenols such as, for example, 4,4',6,6'-tetra-tert-butyl-2,2'-biphenol, in the presence of stoichiometric quantities of amine, preferably tertiary amine, as acid acceptor. In some embodiments of the present invention, different chlorophosphites of the formula (II) may be utilized to prepare a bis-phosphite wherein the R1's and R2's all vary from one another or where the Rt's match but the R2's differ from one to the other.<br>
Preferred bisphosphires include the following:<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
(CH3)3
C(CH3)3<br><br>
 wherein each R' and R2 is independently methyl, ethyl, or wherein R1 and R2 are connected to form a five-membered, six-membered, or seven-membered <br>
cycloalkyl ring or substituted five-membered, substituted six-membered, or substituted seven-membered cycloalkyl ring, and R3 is a carbon to carbon bond, methylene, ethylene, 1,1-ethyl, or isopropylene residue.<br>
Specific preferred embodiments include the following bisphosphites:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3 is a carbon to carbon bond,<br>
methylene, ethylene, 1,1-ethyl, or isopropylene residue.<br>
An advantage of the present invention is that the hydrolytic stability is improved relative to past teachings due to the unique crystallinity of the molecule and the steric crowd around phosphorous.<br>
Another advantage of the present invention include better thermal stability and reduced volatility. Additionally, the high molecular weight, high phosphorous content, and good symmetry of the molecule is expected to<br>
give good polymer capability.<br>

In one embodiment the bis-phosphite compounds of the present invention are used in combination with an amine compound, preferably a polyamine. This combination utilizing an amine compound improves the hydrolytic stability of the bis-phosphite compounds. When a bis-phosphite compound is isolated as a solid, the present invention contemplates that it may be utilized in solid amorphous form. The amorphous phosphite composition is formed by rapid cooling of melt of the phosphite. Such melt may be a mixture of the bis-phosphite compound and polyamine which is rapidly cooled to form a solid amorphous phosphite composition. The amorphous nature of composition enhances the hydroly tic stability of the solid composition compared to crystalline composition containing the same constituents, such compositions may additionally contain respective amounts of an amine preferably an aliphatic polyamine.<br>
The amorphous composition is prepared by melting the crystalline bis-phosphite compound, or a blend of the crystalline bis-phosphite compound and an amine or other desired ingredients, to form a melt blend. The resulting melt blend is cooled to form an amorphous solid bis-phosphite compound composition. The process may also involve storing the bis-phosphite compound for a period in excess of 10 days (possibly in humid conditions (&gt;60% relative humidity)) at ambient temperature, and then compounding the bis-phosphite compound composition with a thermoplastic polymer such as a polyolefin, for example polypropylene for thermal oxidative stability thereof.<br>
The amorphous stabilizer composition of the present invention preferably comprises at least 50 percent by weight of the bis-phosphite compound based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, more preferably comprises from 80 percent by weight to 99.9 percent by weight of the bis-phosphite compound based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, more preferably from 90 to 99.8 percent by weight thereof, more preferably from 95 to 99.5 percent by weight thereof, and most preferably from 97 to 99 percent by weight thereof.<br>
The amine is preferably present at a level of from 0.1 to 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the stabilizer composition, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 percent by weight thereof, more preferably present at a level of from 0.6 to 5 percent by weight thereof, and most preferably from 1 to 3 percent by weight thereof . Such stabilizer amine compositions are preferably in the form of amorphous (non-crystalline) particles, such as powders and pellets.<br>
The preferred amine additives are polyamines, and more preferably aliphatic polyamines. The aliphatic polyamine preferably has a boiling point of greater than 175°C, more preferably greater than 190°C, and most preferably greater than 200°C. The aliphatic polyamine may contain primary, secondary or tertiary amine groups. Preferably the amine groups are primary amine groups. The polyamine may contain 2,3 or more amine groups, and in other words may be a diamine, triamine or greater polyamine amine. The preferred polyamines are aliphatic primary diamines of the formula<br>
H2N-R10— NH,<br>
wherein R10 is selected from G, to do divalent alkyl groups, and more preferably the diamine is selected from 1,6 diaminohexane and 1,10-diaminodecane. Suitable aliphatic secondary diamines may be represented by the general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R11 is selected from C1 to C10 divalent alkyl groups and R12 is selected from C1 to C30 monovalent alkyl group. Suitable aliphatic tertiary diaminesmay be represented by the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R11 and R12 are defined as above. Most preferably the polyamine is an aliphatic primary diamine. The amines may also be monoamines and<br>
hydroxylamines such as triisopropanolamine, and R12NH2, (R12)2NH, (R12)3N, (R")2NOH.<br>
The concentration of the bis-phosphite compounds in the polymeric material which will effectively inhibit polymer degradation can vary considerably depending on the particular polymer being stabilized and the end use for which the stabilized polymeric material is designed. Generally, concentration in the range of 0.001 to 5.0 weight percent may be used with concentrations of about 0.01 to 0.5 being most common. Polymeric particles may be coated with the present phosphites alone or in combination with other stabilizers for stabilization of the polymeric material. The bis-phosphite stabilizers provided by this invention typically will be used in combination with other conventional stabilizers such as phenolic antioxidants, phosphites, hydroxylamines, 3-arylbenzofuranones, polyvalent salts of organic acids, and thioethers. In addition, any of the aforementioned additives may be present.<br>
Consistent with the invention, the bis-phosphite stabilizer may be incorporated into the polymeric materials any time prior to or during fabrication by any of a variety of means unknown in the art. For example, the stabilizer may be added directly to a melt of the polymer on a roll mill to distribute the phosphite compound uniformly throughout the polymer. Alternatively, the bis-phosphite compound may be dry-blended with a finely-divided form of the polymer such as pellets and then the dry mix can be mixed further in and extruded from an extruder.<br>
It should be clear that the present invention encompasses the bis-phosphite compounds described herein as well as polymeric materials and articles of polymeric materials that contain the bis-phosphite compounds.<br>
All patents cited herein are in incorporated by reference.<br>
The utility of the bis-phosphite compounds as stabilizers for polymeric materials is further illustrated by the following examples.<br><br>

As seen by these data, compositions made with the phosphites of the present invention (i.e., Phos-2 to 5) illustrate remarkably good retention of molecular weight as indicated by the very small shift in the melt flow rate. (MFR) even after as repeated extrusions. Outstanding color retention is also retained with the addition of the phosphites of the present invention. Phos-1 represents the best state of the art phosphite that is presently commercially available, ULTRANOX 641. These data unexpected show that the properties obtained with the present phosphites approaches that of the ULTRANOX 641.<br>
Several illustrative phosphites were analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) to better understand their thermal stability. The results of these studies are found in Table 2.<br>
Table 2.<br>
TGA of butylated phenol based bisphosphites at a heating rate of 20°C/minute from room temperature to 500°C under nitrogen.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As seen by the data within Table 2, the phosphites of the present invention have outstanding thermal stability. The higher the temperature, the less volatile the phosphite and the greater the overall thermal stability.<br>
The hydrolytic stability of several illustrative phosphites of the present invention was measured under a variety of temperatures and relative humidities. The results are summarized in Table 3.<br>
Table 3 Hvdrolvtic Stability Studies<br>
Compound<br>
RT/RH -80%<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The times in hours to gain 1 % in the weight were recorded. It was unexpected for compounds Phos-2, Phos-3, and Phos-5 to have such high stability without the addition of any amines.<br>
The melting points of several of the phosphites of the present invention were compared to the melting points of several other phosphites outside the scope of the present invention. The data is located within Table 4.<br>
Table 4.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Phos-3 and -5 are substituted in the 2,2' positions on the bis-aromatic rings, whereas Phos-7 and -8 are substituted in the 4,4' positions. Also, the structure of Phos-3 corresponds roughly with the structure of Phos-8, and have similar molecular weights. Likewise the structure of Phos-5 corresponds roughly with the structure of Phos-7. As can be seen by these data, substitution in the 2,2' positions unexpectedly affords a lower melting point than that obtained with similar substitution in the 4,4' positions. The lower melting point is desirable for obtaining a better dispersion in many thermoplastic resins. In this respect, phosphites having melting points of about 210°C or lower are especially useful and desired. Thus, the phosphites of the present invention meet the long felt need for phosphites that have melting points within the desired range and have outstanding hydrolytic stability.<br>
