FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved portable infusion pump.<br>
This invention further relates to an improved portable infusion pump for administering fluids into a subject, even when the subject is in moving state.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Ambulatory drug infusion is finding    increased use in the treatment of<br>
different diseases, such as Thalassaemia, Cancer, Kidney trouble and such others. It also finds application in case of pain-relieving injections, insulin injections etc. By providing mobility, it enables the patient to resume a more normal lifestyle while receiving needed medications oyer prolonged periods. The ambulatory infusion has also been adopted for total parental nutrition for patients whose systems cannot tolerate rapid carbohydrate infusions. Out of hospital infusions can also offer considerable financial savings for patients who are otherwise in good physical conditions. Among the most severe and common forms of Thalassaemia is B-thalassaemia which necessitates regular blood infusion (packed cells) to the patients to supplement their low haemoglobin level. However, the body has to get rid<br>
Contd..p/2.<br><br>
of extra iron which gets deposited to the vital organs and this is done by infusing an iron chelating agent called Desferrioxamine into the body. This infusion takes place over 8-20 hours and thus the pumping device has to be portable so that the patient can move around and attend to his/her regular activities. This requires expensive infusion pump equipment. The types of infusion pumps commercially available are the implant type, the ambulatory but fixed interval pulsated type or the micrometer driven type. All these type involve hi-technology and pulsatile intervals and infusion volumes are preset at manufacture. Besides the above, existing devices typically employ long spur gear trains to reduce the speed and therefore all these types are very costly and as a consequence beyond the reach of poor patients.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to propose an improved infusion pump which is light, portable and suitable for administering fluids into a subject even when the subject is in moving state.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to propose an improved infusion pump which is inexpensive, simple to operate and consumes less power.<br>
V<br><br>
3.<br>
Another  object  of  this invention  to  propose  an  improved infusion pump which is reliable and durable-It is yet another abject of this invention to propose an infusion pump which can continuously operate for 10 - 12 hours and regulate the pumping speed.<br>
Thus according to this invention there is provided an improved portable infusion pump comprising an improved portable infusion pump for administering fluid into a subject comprising an electric motor having an output shaft coupled to a toothed belt puller means; an intermediate drive meams; a plurality of bevel gears, and an idle gear for reduction of the rotational output of said output shaft and for supply of power to a bevel gear differential, a screw differential means for causing differential linear movement of its constituent members; a pusher plate transmitting the linear movement of one of the constituent members of said screw differential means to the plunger of a coupleable transfusible means for pumping fluid, a switching circuit for regulating the average speed of said motor, characterized in that saids speed—reduction means comprises an epicyclic gear train, and in that said switching circuit has a timer for incrementing and decrementing an on line and off line of the pulse—feeding of said motor in registration with higher and lower pumping requirement of said transfusible means.<br><br>
3A.<br>
The device comprises a motor connected to a speed reducing mechanism which ultimately supplies power to a screw differential. One of the screw member of said screw differential undergoes a differential linear movement. This slow linear movement is transferred to a pusher plate which ultimately pushes the plunger of a coupleable transfusible means which pumps in fluid drops in a living body continuously and/or intermittently at pre-determined rates and at pre-determined intervals.<br><br>
The device employs epicyclic gear train to drastically reduce the number of moving parts in the speed reducing means and also increases the efficiency of (power consumption) of the device. This advantage makes the developed device simple and easy to maintain. Due to lesser number of components-the price of the device is also expected to be less than the existing ones. The average speed to the set up is controlled by a simple electronic switching circuit.<br>
The motor is provided with pulses of voltage and pulse width modulation control is applied through a timer connected in an electronic circuit. When higher rate of pumping is required the motor is supplied with pulses having small off time and high on time. When low speed is required, on time is made low and off time made high. At the outset of the description which follows,it is to be understood that ensuing description only illustrates a particular form which is only an exemplary embodiment and without intending to implying any limitation on the scope of this invention. The nature of the invention, its objective and further advantages residing in the same will be apparent from the following description made with reference to the non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the invention represented in the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic view of the pump according to the present invention. Fig.2   is the electronic switching circuit for average speed control of the motor.<br><br>
5-<br>
The portable infusion pump (refer Fig.l) comprises an  electrical motor  (1),  preferably a 3 volt dry battery cell  operated  low-voltage motor whose r.p,m on no load condition is in the range of 2500  to  3000.  The  average speed  control  of  the  motor  is regulated by an electronic switching circuit (refer Fig .2) which will  be described herein below while defining Fig.2. The  motor output  shaft  (22) is coupled to a multi-stage  speed  reduction means, advantageously an opicyclic gear train (19) via a  toothed belt  pulley  means (5) , an intermediate drive  means  (6) ,  a plurality  of bevel gear (20,21), a planetary bevel gear (8)  and an idle gear (9)- The rotational output of the motor shaft  (22), is  reduced in the first stage by said toothed belt pulley  means (5) comprising a small toothed pulley (10) mounted rigidly on the motor  output  shaft (22) , a large toothed pulley  (11)  mounted ridigly   on a first shaft (13) disposed parallel to  said  motor shaft, the pulleys (10,11) being operably connected by means  of an  endless  toothed belt (12) having teeth on  its  inner  side. Pitch  of  the inner teeth of the belt (12)  corresponds  to  the pitch  of the toothed pulley (10,11) . In the second  stage,  the rotational  output of said toothed pulley (11) is used  to  drive the first shaft (13) which is supported by a bush bearing  (14). A  first  spur gear (16) is mounted rigidly on said  first  shaft (13) adapted to rotate a second spur gear (17) which is mounted<br>
5<br><br>
6.<br>
loosely  on a second shaft (26) and coupled to a  first  bevel gear (21). A third spur gear (15) is mounted rigidly an the first shaft 
6<br><br>
7.<br>
in mesh with each other. The screws (24,25) are of equal diameter and pitch but opposite hand and mounted on said second and  third shafts  (26,27), wherein right-hand screw (24) is rotated by  the planetary  bevel  gear (8) restricting its linear  movement-  The  spur gear (28) is also rotated along with the right  hand screw  (24) both being mounted rigidly on the same  shaft  (26). The  left hand screw (25) is splined to the third shaft  (27)  so that  It can have independent  linear motion while rotating  with the  third  shaft  (27) - The  spur  gear  (29) ,  which  is rigidly mounted on the third shaft (27), remains in mesh with  the spur gear (28) and thus gets rotated by the  coaxial spur gear 29.  The  spur gear (29) , on being rotated by   gear (28) causes rotation of the third shaft (27) and of the left hand  screw (25). The gear  spur (28) has one  tooth  less than the spur gear (29). Thus, the screws (24,25)  rotate with  rotational  speeds which are very close  but  opposite  in sense. This advantageously causes a 1 inear differential  movement of the left hand screw (25) along with the third shaft (27). A pusher plate (30) is loosely mounted on said left  hand  screw (25)  so  that it can be acted upon by the linear motion  of  the left  hand  screw.  (25). This pusher plate  (30)  transmits  the linear  motion of the left hand scew (25) to a plunger (31) of  a coupleable transfusible means (32), said plunger (31)  generating<br>
7<br><br>
8.<br>
a pumping effect on said transfusible means (32). Advantageously, said coupleable means (32) is s syringe which administers fluid into a subject even in moving state.<br>
Referring  to Figure 2, the linear motion generated at  the  left hand  scriew (25) can  be varied and/or, preset for  example,  by regulating  the average speed of said motor (1) through  applying pulse  width modulation control of pulses of the  input  voltage provided  to the motor (1).  A switching circuit (2) is  provided to  change the average speed of the motor vis-a vis the speed  of pumping which comprises a voltage source (3) generating pulses of voltage  to  said  motor (1) through  a  plurality  of  variable resistances  (Ra ,  Rb )  connected  in  series;  a  timer  (4) operating in a stable multivibrator mode receives voltage  pulses from said resistances (Ra , Rb )5 an intermediate transistor (T1) receives output pulses from said timer (4) which in turn drive  a power transistor (T2) via a resistor (R1 ) which feeds pulses  to the  motor  (1);  a  biasing resistance (R 2); a  plurality  of capacitors  (C1, C2 ); and a diode (D) which are grounded  and connected across the motor terminal, The off time and the on-time of said timer (4) is controlled by said resistances (Ra , Rb), wherein  off-time  is made smal1 and the on-time  is  made  high corresponding  to the requirements of higher zand  lower  pumping respectively-<br>
