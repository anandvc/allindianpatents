METAL-CLADDED METAL MATRIX COMPOSITE WIRE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In general, metal matrix composites (MMCs) are known. MMCs typically include a metal matrix reinforced with either particulates, whiskers, short fibers or long fibers. Examples of metal matrix composites include aluminum matrix composite wires (e.g., silicon carbide, carbon, boron, or polycrystalline alpha alumina fibers embedded in an aluminum matrix), titanium matrix composite tapes (e.g., silicon carbide fibers in a titanium matrix), and copper matrix composite tapes (e.g., silicon carbide or boron fibers embedded in a copper matrix). One use of metal matrix composite wire of particular interest is as a reinforcing member and electrical conductor in bare overhead electrical power transmission cables. One typical need for new cables is driven by the need to increase the power transfer capacity of existing transmission infrastructure.<br>
Desirable performance requirements for cables for overhead power transmission include corrosion resistance, environmental endurance (e.g., UV and moisture), resistance to loss of strength at elevated temperatures, creep resistance, as well as relatively high elastic modulus, low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high electrical conductivity, and/or high strength. Although overhead power transmission cables including aluminum matrix composite wires are known, for some applications there is a continuing desire, for example, for aluminum matrix composite wires having improved strain to failure values and/or size uniformity.<br>
In another aspect, conventional metal matrix composite wires undergo elastic deformation until the applied force is of sufficient magnitude to cause failure. Conventional metal matrix composite wires generally do not exhibit plastic deformation as commonly seen in conventional metal wires. Since conventional metal matrix composite wires do not take a permanent set, additional means must be employed to retain the wires in the cabled state. There is a need in the art for continuous metal matrix composite wire that is able to undergo plastic deformation.<br><br>
400 meters, at least 500 meters, at least 600 meters, at least 700 meters, at least 800 meters, at least 900 meters, or even at least 1000 meters).<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire that exhibits a property of plastic deformation, wherein, in some embodiments, at lengths of at least 100 meters, at least 300 meters, at least 400 meters, at least 500 meters, at least 600 meters, at least 700 meters, at least 800 meters, at least 900 meters, or even at least 1000 meters. The property of plastic deformation means that the wire takes a permanent set by bending the wire.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire effective to dampen recoil effects and prevent secondary fractures, wherein, in some embodiments, when a length of at least 100 meters, at least 300 meters, at least 400 meters, at least 500 meters, at least 600 meters, at least 700 meters, at least 800 meters, at least 900 meters, or even at least 1000 meters) undergoes a primary fracture.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire exhibiting a larger strain to failure as compared to the strain to failure exhibited by the metal matrix composite wire in the absence of the metal cladding.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a cable that includes at least one metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire according to the present invention.<br>

Typically, such fibers have a length on the order of at least 50 meters, and may even have lengths on the order of kilometers or more.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides wire and cable that include metal-cladded fiber reinforced metal matrix composites. The metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire of the present invention comprises a hot worked ductile metal cladding associated with the exterior surface of a metal matrix composite wire. Although not being bound by theory, it is believed that some embodiments of the present invention provide wire with significantly improved properties. At least one metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire according to the present invention may be combined into a cable, (e.g., an electric power transmission cable).<br>
A cross-sectional view of an exemplary metal-cladded fiber reinforced metal matrix composite wire 20 made according to the method of the present invention is provided in FIG. 1. The metal-cladded fiber reinforced metal matrix composite wire 20, hereinafter referred to as metal-cladded composite wire or MCCW, includes ductile metal cladding 22 associated with exterior surface 24 of a metal matrix composite wire 26. Metal matrix composite wire 26 may also be referred to as core wire 26. Ductile metal cladding 22 has an approximately annular shape with a thickness t In some embodiments, metal matrix composite wire 26 is centered longitudinally within MCCW 20.<br><br>
Prior to introduction into cladding machine 30, feedstock 28 for the ductile metal cladding is optionally cleaned to remove surface contamination. One suitable cleaning method is a parorbital cleaning system, available from BWE Ltd. This uses a mild alkaline cleaning solution (e.g. dilute aqueous sodium hydroxide), followed by an acid neutralizer (e.g. dilute acetic or other organic acid in an aqueous solution), and finally a water rinse. In the parorbital system, the cleaning fluid is hot and flows at high velocity along the wire, which is agitated in the fluid. Ultrasonic cleaning with chemical cleaning is also suitable.<br>
The operation of cladding machine 30 is described as follows with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3, and is typically run as a continuous process. First, core wire 26 may be threaded through cladding machine 30, as described above. Feedstock 28 is introduced, in some embodiments as two rods, to a rotating extrusion wheel 34, which in some embodiments contains twin grooves 42 around the periphery. Each groove 42 receives a rod of feedstock 28.<br>
Extrusion wheel 34 rotates, thereby forcing feedstock 28 into die chamber 36. The action of extrusion wheel 34 supplies sufficient pressure, in combination with the heat of die chamber 36, to plasticize feedstock 28. The temperature of the feedstock material within the die chamber 36 is typically below the melting temperature of the material. The material is hot worked such that it is plastically deformed at a temperature and strain rate that allows recrystallization to take place during deformation. By maintaining the feedstock material temperature below title melting point, cladding 22 formed from feedstock 28 has greater hardness than if the feedstock 28 had been applied in a melted form. For example, a temperature of approximately 500°C is typical for aluminum feedstock with a melting point of approximately 660°C.<br>
Feedstock 28 enters die chamber 36 on two sides of core wire 26 to help equalize the pressure and flow of feedstock 28 around core wire 26. The action of extrusion wheel 34 fills die chamber 36 with plasticized feedstock 28 due to re-direction and deformation of feedstock 28 by shoe 32. Cladding machine 30 has typical operating pressures within shoe 32 in the range of 14-40 kg/mm". For successful cladding of core wire 26, the pressure inside of shoe 32 will typically be towards the lower end of the operating range and is customized during operation by adjusting the speed of extrusion wheel 34. The speed of wheel 34 is adjusted until a condition is reached in die chamber 36 such that plasticized feedstock 28 extrudes out of exit die 40 around the core wire 26, without<br><br>
purity and "pure tin"; 99.95% purity). For example, magnesium is available under the trade designation "PURE" from Magnesium Elektron, Manchester, England, Magnesium alloys (e.g., WE43A, EZ33A, AZ81A, and ZE41A) can be obtained, for example, from T1MET, Denver, CO. Copper and alloys thereof are available from South Wire of Carrollton, GA.<br>
MCCW 20 may be formed on a core wire 26 which often includes at least one tow comprising a plurality of continuous;, longitudinally positioned, fibers, such as ceramic (e.g., alumina based) reinforcing fibers encapsulated within a matrix that includes one or more metals (e.g., highly pure, (e.g., greater than 99.95%) elemental aluminum or alloys of pure aluminum with other elements, such as copper). In some embodiments, at least 85% (in some embodiments, at least 90%, or even at least 95%) by number of the fibers in the metal matrix composite wire 26 are continuous. Fiber and matrix selection for metal matrix composite wire 26 suitable for use in MCCW 20 of the present invention are described below.<br>
Fibers<br>
Continuous fibers for making metal matrix composite articles 26 suitable for use in MCCW 20 of the present invention include ceramic fibers, such as metal oxide (e.g., alumina) fibers, boron fibers, boron nitride fibers, carbon fibers, silicon carbide fibers, and combination of any of these fibers. Typically, the ceramic oxide fibers are crystalline ceramics and/or a mixture of crystalline ceramic and glass (i.e., a fiber may contain both crystalline ceramic and glass phases). Typically, this means that the fiber has an aspect ratio (i.e., ratio of the length of Hie fiber to the average diameter of the fiber) of at least 1 x 105 (in some embodiments, at least 1 x 10 , or even at least 1 x 107). Typically, such fibers have a length on the order of at least 50 meters, and may even have lengths on the order of kilometers or more. Typically, the continuous reinforcing fibers have an average fiber diameter of at least 5 micrometers to approximately an average fiber diameter no greater than 50 micrometers. More typically, an average fiber diameter is no greater than 25 micrometers, most typically in a range from 8 micrometers to 20 micrometers.<br>
In some embodiments, the ceramic fibers have an average tensile strength of at least 1.4 GPa, at least 1.7 GPa, at least 2.1 GPa, and or even at least 2.8 GPa. In some embodiments, the carbon fibers have an average tensile strength of at least 1.4 GPa, at<br><br>
Boron nitride fibers can be made, for example, as described in U.S. Pat No. 3,429,722 (Economy) and 5,780,154 (Okano et al.).<br>
Exemplary silicon carbide fibers are marketed, for example, by COI Ceramics of San Diego, CA under the trade designation "NICALON" in tows of 500 fibers, from Ube Industries of Japan, under the trade designation "TYRANNO", and from Dow Coming of Midland, MI under the trade designation "SYLRAMIC".<br>
Exemplary carbon fibers are marketed, for example, by Amoco Chemicals of Alpharetta, GA under the trade designation "THORNEL CARBON" in tows of 2000, 4000, 5,000, and 12,000 fibers, Hexcel Corporation of Stamford, CT, from Grafil, Inc. of Sacramento, CA (subsidiary of Mitsubishi Rayon Co.) under the trade designation "PYROFIL", Toray of Tokyo, Japan, under the trade designation "TORAYCA", Toho Rayon of Japan, Ltd. under the trade designation "BESFIGHT", Zoltek Corporation of St. Louis, MO under the trade designations "PANEX" and "PYRON", and Inco Special Products of Wyckoff, NJ (nickel coated carbon fibers), under the trade designations "12K20"and"12K50".<br>
Exemplary graphite fibers are marketed, for example, by BP Amoco of Alpharetta, GA under the trade designation "T-300" in tows of 1000, 3000, and 6000 fibers.<br>
Exemplary silicon carbide fibers are marketed, for example, by COI Ceramics of San Diego, CA under the trade designation "NICALON" in tows of 500 fibers, from Ube Industries of Japan, under the trade designation "TYRANNO", and from Dow Corning of Midland, MI under the trade designation "SYLRAMIC".<br>
Commercially available fibers typically include an organic sizing material added to the fiber during manufacture to provide lubricity and to protect the fiber strands during handling. The sizing may be removed, for example, by dissolving or burning the sizing away from the fibers. Typically, it is desirable to remove the sizing before forming metal matrix composite wire 26,<br>
The fibers may have coatings used, for example, to enhance the wettability of the fibers, to reduce or prevent reaction between the fibers and molten metal matrix material. Such coatings and techniques for providing such coatings are known in the fiber and metal matrix composite art.<br><br>
embodiments, 45 to 65) percent by volume of the fibers, based on the total combined volume of the fibers and matrix material (i.e., independent of cladding).<br>
The average diameter of core wire 26 is typically between approximately 0.07 millimeter (0.003 inch) to approximately 3.3 mm (0.13 inch). In some embodiments, the average diameter of core wire 26 desirable is at least 1 mm, at least 1.5 mm, or even up to approximately 2.0 mm (0.08 inch).<br>
Making Core Wire<br>
Typically, the continuous core wire 26 can be made, for example, by continuous metal matrix infiltration processes. One suitable process is described, for example, in U.S. Pat No. 6,485,796 (Carpenter et al.).<br>
A schematic of an exemplary apparatus for making continuous metal matrix wire 26 for use in MCCW 20 of the present invention is shown in FIG. 4. Tows of continuous ceramic and/or carbon fibers 44 are supplied from supply spools 46, and are collimated into a circular bundle and for ceramic fibers, heat-cleaned while passing through tube furnace 48. The fibers 44 are then evacuated in vacuum chamber 50 before entering crucible 52 containing the melt 54 of metallic matrix material (also referred to herein as "molten metal"). The fibers are pulled from supply spools 46 by caterpuller 56. Ultrasonic probe 58 is positioned in the melt 54 in the vicinity of the fiber to aid in infiltrating the melt 54 into tows 44. The molten metal of the wire 26 cools and solidifies after exiting crucible 52 through exit die 60, although some cooling may occur before the wire 26 fully exits crucible 52. Cooling of wire 26 is enhanced by streams of gas or liquid 62 that impinge on the wire 26. Wire 26 is collected onto spool 64.<br>
As discussed above, heat-cleaning the ceramic fiber helps remove or reduce the amount of sizing, adsorbed water, and other fugitive or volatile materials that may be present on the surface of the fibers. Typically, it is desirable to heat-clean the ceramic fibers until the carbon content on the surface of the fiber is less than 22% area fraction. Typically, the temperature of the tube furnace 54 is at least 300°C, more typically, at least 1000°C for at least several seconds at temperature, although the particular temperature(s) and time(s) may depend, for example, on the cleaning needs of the particular fiber being used.<br><br>
'U.S. application having Serial No. 09/616,741, filed July 14, 2000; and PCT application having Publication No. WO02/06550, published January 24, 2002.<br>
Typically, the molten metal 54 is degassed (e.g., reducing the amount of gas (e.g., hydrogen) dissolved in the molten metal 54) during and/or prior to infiltration. Techniques for degassing molten metal 54 are well known in the metal processing art. Degassing the melt 54 tends to reduce gas porosity in the wire. For molten aluminum, the hydrogen concentration of the melt 54 is in some embodiments, less than 0.2, 0.15, or even less than 0.1 cm3/100 grams of aluminum.<br>
The exit die 60 is configured to provide the desired wire diameter. Typically, it is desired to have a uniformly round wire along its length. The diameter of the exit die 60 is usually slightly smaller than the diameter of the wire 26. For example, the diameter of a silicon nitride exit die for an aluminum composite wire containing 50 volume percent alumina fibers is 3 percent smaller than the diameter of the wire 26. In some embodiments, the exit die 60 is desirably made of silicon nitride, although other materials may also be useful. Other materials that have been used as exit dies in the art include conventional alumina. It has been found by Applicants, however, that silicon nitride exit dies wear significantly less than conventional alumina dies, and hence are more useful for providing the desired diameter and shape of the wire, particularly over long lengths of wire.<br>
Typically, the wire 26 is cooled after exiting the exit die 60 by contacting the wire 26 with a liquid (e.g., water) or gas (e.g., nitrogen, argon, or air) 62. Such cooling aids in providing the desirable roundness and uniformity characteristics, and freedom from voids. Wire 26 is collected on spool 64.<br>
It is known that the presence of imperfections in the metal matrix composite wire, such as intermetallic phases; dry fiber; porosity as a result, for example, of shrinkage or internal gas (e.g., hydrogen or water vapor) voids; etc. may lead to diminished properties, such as wire 20 strength. Hence, it is desirable to reduce or minimize the presence of such characteristics.<br><br>
'0.5 mm to 3 mm. For example, metal cladding 22 with an approximate wall thickness t of approximately 0.7 mm is suitable for an aluminum composite wire 26 with a nominal 2.1 mm diameter, thereby forming a MCCW 20 with an approximate diameter of 3.5 mm (0.14 inch).<br>
MCCW 20 produced according to the present invention also desirably exhibits the ability to be plastically deformed. Conventional metal matrix composite wires typically exhibit elastic bending modes and do not exhibit plastic deformation without also experiencing material failure. Beneficially, MCCW 20 of the present invention retains an amount of bend (i.e., plastic deformation) when bent and subsequently released. The ability to be plastically deformed is useful in applications where a plurality of wires is to be stranded or coiled into a cable. MCCW 20 may be cabled and will retain the bent structure without requiring additional retention means such as tape or adhesives. Where MCCW 20 is desired to take a permanent set (i.e., plastically deform), cladding 22 will have a thickness t sufficient to counter the return force of core wire 26 to an initial (unbent) state. For core wire 26 with an approximate diameter between 0.07 mm to 3.3 mm, the cladding thickness t will desirably be in the range from 0.5 mm to approximately 3 mm. For example, a metal cladding with an approximate wall thickness of approximately 0.7 mm is suitable for an aluminum composite wire 26 with a nominal 2.1 mm diameter, thereby forming a MCCW 20 with an approximate diameter of 3.5 mm (0.14 inch).<br>
MCCW 20 made according to the methods of the present invention have a length, of at least 100 meters, of at least 200 meters, of at least 300 meters, at least 400 meters, at least 500 meters, at least 600 meters, at least 700 meters, at least 800 meters, or even at least 900 meters.<br>
Cables of metal-cladded metal matrix composite wire<br>
Metal-cladded metal matrix composite wires made according to the present invention can be used in a variety of applications including in overhead electrical power transmission cables.<br>
Cables comprising metal-cladded metal matrix composite wires made according to the present invention may be homogeneous (i.e., including only wires such as MCCW 20) as in FIG. 7, or nonhomogeneous (i.e., including a plurality of secondary wires, such as<br><br>
invention 88. Any suitable number of metal-cladded metal matrix composite wires 88 may be included.<br>
Cables comprising metal-cladded metal matrix composite wires made according to the present invention can be used as a bare cable or can be used as the cable core of a larger diameter cable. Also, cables comprising metal-cladded metal matrix composite wires according to the present invention may be a stranded cable of a plurality of wires with a maintaining means around the plurality of wires. The maintaining means may be, for example, a tape overwrap, with or without adhesive, or a binder.<br>
Stranded cables comprising metal-cladded metal matrix composite wires according to the present invention are useful in numerous applications. Such stranded cables are believed to be particularly desirable for use in overhead electrical power transmission cables due to their combination of relatively low weight, high strength, good electrical conductivity, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high use temperatures, and resistance to corrosion.<br>
Additional details regarding cladded metal matrix composite wires may be found, for example, in copending application having U.S. Serial No. 10/778488, filed February 13,2004.<br>
Advantages and embodiments of this invention are further illustrated by the following examples, but the particular materials and amounts thereof recited in these examples, as well as other conditions and details, should not be construed to unduly limit this invention. All parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise indicated.<br>
EXAMPLES TEST METHODS<br>
Wire Tensile Strength<br>
Tensile properties of MCCW 20 were determined essentially as described in ASTM E345-93, using a tensile tester (obtained under the trade designation "INSTRON"; Model 8562 Tester from Instron Corp., Canton, MA) fitted with a mechanical alignment fixture (obtained under the trade designation "INSTRON"; Model No. 8000-072 from Instron Corp.) that was driven by a data acquisition system (obtained under the trade designation "INSTRON"; Model No. 8000-074 from Instron Corp.).<br><br>
A strain rate of 0.01 cm/cm (0.01 inch/inch) was used in a position control mode. The stain was monitored using a dynamic strain gauge extensometer (obtained under the trade designation "INSTRON", Model No. 2620-824 from Instron Corp.). The distance between extensometer knife edges was 1.27 cm (0.5 inch) and the gauge was positioned at the center of the gauge length and secured with rubber bands. The wire diameter was determined using either micrometer measurements at three positions along the wire or from measuring the cross-sectional area and calculating the effective diameter to provide the same cross-sectional area. Output from the tensile test provided load to failure, tensile strength, tensile modulus, and strain to failure data for the samples. Ten samples were tested, from which average, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation could be calculated.<br>
Fiber Strength<br>
Fiber strength was measured using a tensile tester (commercially available under the trade designation "INSTRON 4201 "from Instron Corp. Canton, MA), and the test described in ASTM D 3379-75, (Standard Test Methods for Tensile Strength and Young's Modulus for High Modulus Single-Filament Materials). The specimen gauge length was 25.4 mm (1 inch), and the strain rate was 0.02 mm/mm. To establish the tensile strength of a fiber tow, ten single fiber filaments were randomly chosen from a tow of fibers and each filament was tested to determine its breaking load.<br>
Fiber diameter was measured optically using an attachment to an optical microscope (commercially available under the trade designation "DOLAN-JENNER MEASURE-RITE VIDEO MICROMETER SYSTEM", Model M25-0002, from Dolan-Jenner Industries, Inc. of Lawrence, MA) at lOOOx magnification. The apparatus used reflected light observation with a calibrated stage micrometer. The breaking stress of each individual filament was calculated as the load per unit area.<br>
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion CCTE)<br>
The CTE was measured following ASTM E-228, published in 1995. The work was performed on a dilatometer (obtained under the trade designation "UNITHERM 1091") using a wire length of 5.1 cm (2 inch).   A fixture was used to hold the sample<br><br>
' Fiber Volume Fraction<br>
The fiber volume fraction was measured by a standard metallographic technique. The wire cross-section was polished and the fiber volume fraction measured by using the density profiling functions with the aid of a computer program called NIH IMAGE (version 1.61), a public domain image-processing program developed by the Research Services Branch of the National Institutes of Health. This software measured the mean gray scale intensity of a representative area of the wire.<br>
A piece of the wire was mounted in mounting resin (obtained under the trade designation "EPOXICURE" from Buehler Inc., Lake Bluff, IL). The mounted wire was polished using a conventional grinder/polisher (obtained from Struers, West Lake, OH) and conventional diamond slurries with the final polishing step using a 1 micrometer diamond slurry obtained under the trade designation "DIAMOND SPRAY" from Struers) to obtain a polished cross-section of the wire. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) photomicrograph was taken of the polished wire cross-section at 150x. When taking the SEM photomicrographs, the threshold level of the image was adjusted to have all fibers at zero intensity, to create a binary image. The SEM photomicrograph was analyzed with the NIH IMAGE software, and the fiber volume fraction obtained by dividing the mean intensity of the binary image by the maximum intensity. The accuracy of this method for determining the fiber volume fraction was believed to be +/- 2%.<br>
Roundness Value<br>
Roundness value, which is a measure of how closely the wire cross-sectional shape approximates a circle, is defined by the mean of the single roundness values over a specified length. Single roundness values for calculating the mean was determined as follows using a rotating laser micrometer (obtained from Zumbach Electronics Corp., Mount Kisco, NY under the trade designation "ODAC 30J ROTATING LASER MICROMETER"; software: "USYS-100", version BARU13A3), set up such that the micrometer recorded the wire diameter every 100 msec during each rotation of 180 degrees. Each sweep of 180 degrees took 10 seconds to accomplish. The micrometer sent a report of the data from each 180 degree rotation to a process database. The report contained the minimum, maximum, and average of the 100 data points collected during the rotation cycle.   The wire speed was 1.5 meters/minute (5 feet/minute).   A "single<br><br>
Example 1<br>
An aluminum matrix composite wire was prepared using 34 tows of 1500 denier "NEXTEL 610" alumina ceramic fibers. Each tow contained approximately 420 fibers. The fibers were substantially round in cross-section and had diameters ranging from approximately 11-13 micrometers on average. The average tensile strength of the fibers (measured as described above) ranged from 2.76-3.58 GPa (400-520 ksi). Individual fibers had strengths ranging from 2.06-4.82 GPa (300-700 ksi). The fibers (in the form of multiple tows) were fed through the surface of the melt into a molten bath of aluminum, passed in a horizontal plane under 2 graphite roller, and then back out of the melt at 45 degrees through the surface of the melt, where a die body was positioned, and then onto a take-up spool (e.g. as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,336,495 (McCullough et al.), Fig. 1). The aluminum (&gt;99.95% Aluminum from Belmont Metals, New York, NY) was melted in an alumina crucible having dimensions of 24.1 cm x 31.3 cm x 31.8 cm (9.5" x 12.5" x 12.5") (obtained from Vesuvius McDaniel of Beaver Falls, Pa.). The temperature of the molten aluminum was approximately 720°C. An alloy of 95% niobium and 5% molybdenum (obtained from PMTI Inc. of Large, PA) was fashioned into a cylinder having dimensions of 12.7 cm (5 inch) long x 2.5 cm (1 inch) diameter. The cylinder was used as an ultrasonic horn actuator by tuning to the desired vibration (i.e., tuned by altering the length), to a vibration frequency of 20.06-20.4 kHz. The amplitude of the actuator was greater than 0.002 cm (0.0008 inch). The tip of the actuator was introduced parallel to the fibers between the rollers, such that the distance between them was 
The die body positioned at the exit side was made from boron nitride and was inclined at 45 degrees to the melt surface and contained a hole with an internal diameter suitable to introduce an alumina thread-guide, which had an internal diameter of 2 mm (0.08 inch). The thread guide was glued in to place using an alumina paste. Upon exiting from the die, the wire was cooled with nitrogen gas to prevent damage to and burning of rubber drive rollers that pulled the wire and fiber through the process. The wire was then spooled up on flanged wooden spools.<br><br>
The extrusion wheel 36 speed was adjusted until aluminum extruded out of the exit die 40 around the ACW 26, and the pressure in the chamber was sufficient to cause some partial bonding between cladding 22 and ACW 26. In addition, extruded aluminum 28 pulled the core wire 26 through exit die 40 such that a take-up drum collecting MCCW 20 product did not apply tension. The line speed of the product exiting the machine was approximately 50m/min. After exiting the machine, the wire passed through troughs of water to cool it, and then was wound on the take-up drum. A sample of clad ACW was made (304 m (1000 ft) length) with a 0.7 mm clad wall thickness.<br>
The MCCW 20 contains a nominal 2.06 mm (0.081 inch) diameter ACW 26 with aluminum cladding 22 to create MCCW 20 of 3.5 mm (0.140 inch) diameter. The irregular shape of ACW 26 was compensated for in the cladding 22 to create an extremely circular product. The area fraction of MCCW 20 is 33% ACW, 67% aluminum cladding. Given the 45% fiber volume fraction in ACW 26, the MCCW 20 has a'net fiber volume fraction of approximately 15%.<br>
Using the wire tensile strength test described above, wire made in Example 1 was tested (3.8 cm (1.5 inch gauge length)):<br><br>
MCCW 20 from Example 1, was tested to measure the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), along the axis of the wire. The results are illustrated in the graph of CTE versus Temperature of FIG. 8. The CTE ranges from -14-19 ppm/°C over the temperature range -75°C to +500°C.<br>
The MCCW 20 of Example 1 was measured for Wire Roundness, Roundness Uniformity Value, and Diameter Uniformity Value.<br><br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
AMC core wires 26, 2.06 nun (0.081 inch) diameter (prepared as described in Example 1), were tested to failure in tension using the Wire Tensile Strength Test described above. The number of breaks were recorded after the test by visual inspection. Multiple breaks were observed for wires with gage lengths equal or longer than 380 mm (15 inches). The number of breaks typically varied from 2 to 4 for gage lengths up to 635 mm (25 inches). A high speed video camera (marketed under the trade designation "KODAK" by Kodak, Rochester, NY (Kodak HRC 1000, 500 frames/sec; placed 61 cm (2 feet) from sample) was used to document the failure mechanism. The video shows the sequence of breaks in each wire; primary (the first) failure was tensile in nature, and all subsequent failures (i.e., secondary fractures) showed general compressive buckling as one of the operative mechanisms. Fractography (SEM) of other fracture surfaces also revealed that compressive micro-buckling was another secondary failure mechanism.<br>
Example 3<br>
AMC core wires 26, 2.06 mm (0.081 inch) diameter cladded with a 0.7 mm (0.03 inch) aluminum cladding 22 (as described for Example 1), were tested to failure in tension. The clad wire (MCCW 20) had a 635mm (25 inch) gage length. The clad wire did not exhibit secondary fractures after primary failure in tension (the load to failure was on average 4900 N). The absence of secondary fractures was verified by re-gripping the longer section of broken wires (MCCW 20) and re-testing them in tension (the gage length was still greater than 38.1 cm (15 inch). Upon re-testing, the clad wires (MCCW 20) exhibited a slightly greater load to failure (-5000N). This result indicated that there were no hidden secondary fracture sites in the clad wire. The load-displacement also clearly indicated the role of the aluminum cladding 22 when the primary tensile failures occur, as shown in the graph of FIG. 10. The sudden drop in load is associated with the primary failure on the ACW 26, however, the load does not drop to zero immediately; some of the load is carried by the aluminum cladding 22 which stretches and dampens the sudden recoil as illustrated by the area of the graph at arrow 90.<br><br>
The ends of coiled sample 92 were then released and the clad wire (MCCW 20) was allowed to relax to a final curved form. The dimensions Y9 and L' were measured on this relaxed wire and the final bend radius Rfmai was calculated. The results for various examples are presented in Table 2 below.<br><br>
The relaxed radius versus the bend radius is plotted in FIG. 12.<br>
Two theoretical models, the Inner Radius Model and the Plastic Hinge Model, were used to predict the thickness of the cladding required for a MCCW to hold a set of 13.0 inches (33.0 cm). The following calculations determine the necessary thickness t of cladding around a core wire with radius r that is necessary to maintain a final relaxed bending radius of p for MCCW.   The models differ in how the ductile metal in the -<br>
cladding yields.<br>
The bending moment of the center core wire is:<br><br>
The moment of area L =wfor a solid circular cross-section is:<br><br><br>
The following parameters are used for the following example: core wire radius r = .040 inch core wire elastic modulus E = 24 MSI MCCW bend radius p = 13 inch<br>
cladding yield stress өx = 9,000 ksi These are solved for the cladding thickness given the measured bend radius of the<br>
wire (13.0 inches, 33.0 cm) and an assumed yield strength of the cladding material (9 ksi)<br>
(62 MPa).<br>
