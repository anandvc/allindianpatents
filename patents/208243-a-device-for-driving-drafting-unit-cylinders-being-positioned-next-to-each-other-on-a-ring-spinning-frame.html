The invention relates to a device for driving drafting unit cylinders, positioned next to each other, in a ring spinning frame in particular, through motors and interconnected gears, whereat a motor is connected through at least one endless driving element with the gear and where the gear on  its output side is being coupled with a drafting unit cylinder.<br>
In drafting units of spinning frames, ring spinning frames in particular, drafting unit cylinders run at different speeds. The drive of said drafting unit cylinders presents a problem of its own. On one hand the space for the drives in such spinning frames is extremely limited, so that they have to be kept as small as possible. Therefore, nowadays the drive is for instance directly coupled with one gear which either drives two or three drafting unit cylinders, whereat the varying speeds of the drafting unit cylinders are being determined through respective transmissions. It is also known that a drive shaft of the motor is being directly coupled to a drafting unit cylinder. This way, however, much space, mainly in longitudinal direction of the ring spinning frame, is required. Furthermore, the connection between motor, gear and drafting unit cylinder is rigid and cannot be varied easily. From a textile technological point of view it is desirable, that the drafting<br>
unit cylinders can be varied in their position towards each<br>
i<br>
other. This can only be achieved through time-consuming reassembly work.<br>
It is the task of the present invention* to improve a device of the above mentioned type and in particular to provide a more variable and more compact drive of the drafting unit cylinders.<br>
The task is solved in that a gear is mounted on a support which is being held by a frame of the machine, that a motor by means of a holder is connected on a gear or on a support and that at least two supports for gears and/or motors are arranged next to each other in longitudinal direction of the cylinders, so that<br><br>
the gears, the motors respectively, are being supported within the ring spinning frame in longitudinal direction of said spinning frame and/or at right angle to it in a staggered manner, in order to obtain an accessible* space-saving arrangement.<br>
i<br>
i<br>
By means of these endless driving elements, which mainly consist of belts and in particular toothed belts, it is possible to arrange gear and motor on one plane, so that only a minimum of the space must be occupied in1longitudinal direction of the ring spinning frame.<br>
be arranged floatingly, whereat a holder is being provided<br>
between the gear and the motor. Thus, th6 motor can be located<br>
in a position, which with regard to the required space, is most<br>
suitable. Fastening of the motor on a part of the machine frame<br>
is not necessary.<br>
In order to adjust the tension of the endless driving element, the holder is to be adjustable. This can be achieved in that the holder is formed as a stripe-type spectacle shaped frame and which is being provided with a recesS, into which the gear is being mounted, furthermore a recess, into which the motor is being mounted, whereat for adjustment in the longitudinal direction an eccentric ring being rotatajsle is being arranged in at least one recess. On the eccentric ring the motor, the gear respectively is being mounted. By turning the eccentric ring, the distance between motor and gear is being changed.<br>
In a further exemplified embodiment the motor and gear are arranged to be mounted on one wall. Thus motor and gear are arranged on the same plane, which results in a very compact arrangement in axial direction.<br>
It is further possible to drive several gears through one motor. For this an auxiliary shaft is being provided between<br><br>
the motor and for instance two gears, which then each, by means of the corresponding driving elements are being connected with the motor and the gears.<br>
The invention is being further described in connection wi th the accompanying figures, in which show,<br>
Figure 1  a schematic partial side view of a ring spinning<br>
frame within the area of the drives for drafting unit cylinders;<br>
Figure 2 a top view onto a holder<br>
Figure 3 a partial section from a side view of a partial area of a ring spinning frame-<br>
In figure 1 are three drafting unit cylinders 1, 2 and 3 indicated. Drafting unit cylinder 1 is an intake cylinder,<br>
drafting unit cylinder 2 is an intermediate cylinder and<br>
â– <br>
drafting unit cylinder 3 is an output cylinder.<br>
On the intake cylinder 1 a gear wheel 4 is mounted, which meshes with a further gear wheel 5 being mounted on a drive shaft 6, whereat said drive shaft 6 extends from a gear 7. Said gear 7 is fastened on a wall 8 of a not further shown machine frame, whereat the drive shaft 6 reaches through this wall 8 and the gear wheel 5 is being mounted on said drive shaft 6 on the other side of the wall. Preferably the gear wheels 4, 5 are arranged in a gear casing and the gear on its output side is being coupled with the intake cylinder.<br>
i To the gear 7 a sleeve 9 is being connected which is partially indicated by a dotted line and onto which a spectacle-shaped frame 10 is being mounted. Said spectacle shaped frame 10 is shown in more detail in figure 2. Roughly it is of stripe-type form and at one end it is being provided with a recess 11 into which an eccentric ring 12 is being placed. Said eccentric ring<br><br>
12 is arranged rotatably in the direction of the double arrow and is being furnished with an eccentrically arranged cylindric bore 13, into which, in operating position, the sleeve 9 extends. The eccentric ring 12 serves for instance to tension the driving element 27.<br>
Fixation is then carried out by means of corresponding fastening elements as for instance screws which are being inserted through holes 14 and which are screwed into the corresponding thread holes in the casing of the gear 7.<br>
On the opposite side of the recess 11 the spectacle shaped frame 10 is provided with a further bearing recess 15, which serves to receive a tensioning wheel 16. Said tensioning wheel 16 presses against the driving element 17 which is preferably a tooth belt.<br>
The belt 17 encloses an auxiliary shaft 18, which is being put into rotational motion by a further belt 19. The belt 19 encloses a corresponding, not further shown drive wheel of a motor 20 which is being fastened onto a further wall 21 of the machine frame.<br>
By means of an auxiliary shaft 18 which also reaches through the wall 21 and thereafter through a bearing housing 22, also a further belt 23 is being driven, which stays in operative connection with an input shaft 24 of a further gear 25. Also to this belt 23 a belt tensioning device in form of a spectacle shaped frame 10 is being arranged, which corresponds with spectacle shaped frame 10.2. By means of a further tensioning wheel 16.1 the belt tension is being adjusted, whereat the spectacle shaped frame 10.1 is being fastened onto a further sleeve 9.1.<br>
The gear 2 5 is also mounted to the wall 21 and, through said<br>
i<br>
wall, it is in driving connection with the intermediate cylinder 2.<br><br>
The output cylinder 3 is also provided with a gear wheel 4.1 just like the intake cylinder 1, said gear wheel meshes with a gear wheel 5.1 on a drive shaft 6.1 of a further gear 26. Said gear 26, like the gear 7, is arranged on the wall 8. Through a further belt 27 the gear 26 stays in operative connection with a motor 28 being supported floatingly on one side. The tension of said belt 27 is being produced by a further spectacle shaped frame 10.2, which is designed similar to the other spectacle shaped frame 10 and 10.1. However, it is not being provided with a tension wheel, but is mounted on a sleeve 9.3 on the gear 26 and supports the motor 28.i By turning the eccentric ring 12 the distance between the two sleeves 9.2 and 9.3 in the recesses 11 and 15 can be changed. Thus the tension of the belts can be adjusted.<br>
Figure 3 shows that the gear 7 is positioned in a slanted recess 30 within the wall 8. Thus, the gear 7 is being supported shiftably in said recess' 30 in the direction of the double arrow x.<br>
In a simple exemplified embodiment two rims 31.1 and 31.2 facing each other serve as rails and thus as guides for the gear 7. The rims 31.1 and 31.2 protrude into grooves 32.1 and 32.2, indicated in dotted lines, within a gear box. For the fixation of the gear 7 suitable not further shown clamping elements, fastening screws or similar parts are being applied.<br>
By choice, the gears 25, 26 too can in the same manner be supported shiftably in a recess on the wall 8, wall 21 respectively.<br>
The walls 8 and 21 are supported in a frame 33 of the spinning frame, as can be seen from figure 1. Accordingly the holder between motor 20 and gear 7 consists of parts of the wall 8, the frame 33 and the wall 21. The walls 8 and 21 do not necessarily need to be of flat shape; they can generally be<br><br>
described as supports. A  support 8 together with gear 26 and motor 28 can be combined into a separate structural unit, which is fastened dismountably within the machine frame 33.<br><br><br><br>
