				<td>Preparation of new Layered Double Hydroxides Exchanged with<br>
Diisopropylamide for C-C Bond forming reactions<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to preparation of layered double hydroxides exchanged<br>
with diisopropylamide (LDH-diisopropylamide) useful as recyclable catalysts for preparing<br>
aldols / a,p-unsaturated nitriles / a,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified products / Pnitroalkanols<br>
/ Michael adducts and epoxides. More particularly the present invention relates<br>
to preparation of layered double hydroxides exchanged with diisopropylamide of the formula<br>
[M1 and /or MII<br>
(1.x) MIH<br>
X (OH)2][NCH(CH3)2"]x/2.zH2O wherein M1 is a monovalent cation<br>
(Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+ or Cs+), M11 is a divalent cation (Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+<br>
or Ca2+); M111 is a trivalent ion (A13+, Cr3+, Mn3+, Fe3+, Co3+, Ni3+, or La3+); x has a value<br>
ranging between 0.10 to 0.50 and more preferably 0.20 to 0.33; z is an integer whose values<br>
depends on the ingredients and reactions conditions used and methods of preparation and use<br>
thereof. The LDH-diisopropylamides of this invention are recyclable catalysts for preparing<br>
aldols / cc,p-unsaturated nitriles / ot,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified products / pnitroalkanols<br>
/ Michael adducts and epoxides.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an eco-friendly process employing recyclable<br>
LDH-diisopropylamide as an heterogeneous catalyst in place of soluble bases for preparing<br>
aldols / a,p-unsaturated nitriles / cc,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified products / Pnitroalkanols<br>
/ Michael adducts and epoxides by reacting with corresponding aldehydes with<br>
acetone (Aldol condensation), aldehydes with activated nitriles or esters (Knoevenagel<br>
condensation), alcohols with p-keto or simple esters (transesterification), aldehydes with<br>
nitro alkanes (Henry reaction), activated methylenes with a,p-unsaturated compounds<br>
(Michael addition), epoxidation of olefins. The obtained products are important intermediates<br>
for the preparations of drugs, Pharmaceuticals, perfumes, cosmetics, oils, paint and fine<br>
chemicals. For example the products of benzylidene derivatives prepared by Knoevenagel<br>
condensation are used to inhibit tyrosine proteinase kinase, fine chemicals such as styrene<br>
oxide, 1-decene oxide, 1-octene oxide, 1-hexene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, cyclopentene<br>
oxide, epoxy chalcones by epoxidation of olefins, can be obtained by this method.<br>
There are serious disadvantages in performing the reactions such as Aldol,<br>
Knoevenagel condensation, transesterification, Henry reaction, Michael addition and<br>
epoxidation of olefins with homogeneous system in the manufacture of aldols / a,punsaturated<br>
nitriles / a,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified products / p-nitroalkanols /<br>
Michael adducts and epoxides due to presence of toxic wastes remnants of neutralization of<br>
soluble base with acid at the end of the reaction, lack of reusability and selectivity, tedious<br>
work-up procedure, higher temperatures and longer reaction times. By employing the<br>
heterogeneous catalytic system, the cost naturally comes down due to easy recovery and<br>
recyclability of the catalyst for number of recycles and very insignificant loss of active<br>
species, when compared with homogenous system. The products thus obtained using<br>
heterogeneous catalyst system are benign in the sense that the presence of minor impurities<br>
due to side reactions is also precluded.<br>

Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to prepare a heterogeneous recyclable<br>
LDH- diisopropylamide and use in catalytic amounts for preparing aldols / a,p-unsaturated<br>
nitriles / a,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified products / p-nitroalkanols / Michael adducts<br>
and epoxides which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is that LDH as synthesized having<br>
interstitial anions such as chloride, nitrate, carbonate, sulfate or calcination of LDH having<br>
the said interstitial anions at temperatures in the range of 350 to 550°C is used as precursors<br>
for the preparation of LDH-diisopropylamide.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to recover the heterogeneous LDHdiisopropylamide<br>
used in C-C bond forming reactions comprising Aldol, Knoevenagel.<br>
Michael,etc , transesterification and epoxidation by simple filtration and reuse for number of<br>
cycles with consistent activity and selectivity.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is the quantity of LDHdiisopropylamide<br>
used in the reaction contains 1 to 10 mol % of diisopropylamide with<br>
respect to the substrate.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the design and preparation of LDHdiisopropylamide<br>
through simple exchange process for the first time and its use in catalytic<br>
amounts for preparing aldols / a,p-unsaturated nitrites / oc,p-unsaturated esters /<br>
transesterified products / p-nitroalkanols / Michael adducts and epoxides. Higher yields were<br>
obtained when LDH-diisopropylamide catalysts are used in the C-C bond forming<br>
epoxidation, and transesterification reactions in organic solvents. The products obtained by<br>
various methods are important intermediates for the preparation of drugs, Pharmaceuticals,<br>
perfumes, cosmetics, oils, paints and fine chemicals. The consistent activity for several<br>
cycles in C-C bond formation reactions makes the processes economical and possible for<br>
commercial realisation. Therefore, LDH-diisopropylamide is better option for the synthesis<br>
of aldols / oc,p-unsaturated nitriles / a,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified products / Pnitroalkanols<br>
/ Michael adducts and epoxides. Thus this invention offers the best technoeconomic<br>
route for the synthesis of intermediates in the preparation of drugs,<br>
Pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. The use of different metals and in varied compositions<br>
used in the preparation of LDH support has showed little impact on its final form of LDHdiisopropylamide<br>

Scientific Explanation:<br>
In the present invention, we prepared LDH-diisopropylamide for the first time and<br>
used in catalytic amounts for the preparation of aldols / a,(3-unsaturated nitriles / a,(3-<br>
unsaturated esters / transesterified products / p-nitroalkanols / Michael adducts and epoxides<br>
in a heterogeneous way.<br>
LDH-diisopropylamide is prepared by anion exchange method from the LDH<br>
containing chloride, nitrate anions or their calcined forms. The diisopropylamide anions in<br>
LDH are responsible for the Aldol and Knoevenagel condensations, transesterification,<br>
Henry reactions, Michael addition and epoxidation reactions. The activity of LDHdiisopropylamide<br>
is similar or higher than the homogeneous counter parts. The higher<br>
activity is ascribed to the support effect. The basic LDH-NCH(CH3)i induces abstraction of<br>
proton from the active methylene group to trigger C-C coupling in epoxidation and<br>
transesterification reactions.<br>
Higher yields are obtained with LDH- diisopropylamide catalysts and the products<br>
are important intermediates for the preparation of drugs and pharmaceuticals, this invention<br>
is timely and appropriate. Therefore, LDH-diisopropylamide is a better option. The LDHdiisopropylamide<br>
catalysts prepared by various metals showed little variation in the catalytic<br>
activity. Albeit, all the metals used in the preparation of LDH offered good to excellent<br>
yields. Thus this invention offers the best techno-economic route for the preparation of<br>
intermediates of drugs, pharmaceuticals, perfumes, cosmetics, oils, paints and fine chemicals.<br>
LDH-diisopropylamides are prepared as exemplified and used in catalytic amounts<br>
for preparing aldols / a,p-unsaturated nitriles / oc,p-unsaturated esters / transesterified<br>
products / p-nitroalkanols / Michael adducts and epoxides in a heterogeneous way as<br>
described in the examples.<br>

hexahydrate (30.8 g, 0.12 mol) and aluminum nitrate nonahydrate (15.0 g, 0.04 mol) which<br>
were dissolved in 100 ml of deionised and decarbonated water. The pH of the solution was<br>
adjusted to -10 by the addition of NaOH (2M). The slurry was stirred for 2 h at room<br>
temperature under nitrogen atmosphere and then filtered under nitrogen atmosphere, washed<br>
thoroughly and dried under vacuum at 80°C.<br>

25 °C to 100 mL of NaOH solution at pH 10 while stirring under a nitrogen flow. The pH of<br>
the reaction mixture was maintained constantly (-10) by the continuous addition of 2 M<br>
NaOH. The suspension thus obtained was stirred overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere at<br>
70°C. The solid product was isolated by filtration, washed thoroughly with deionised water,<br>
