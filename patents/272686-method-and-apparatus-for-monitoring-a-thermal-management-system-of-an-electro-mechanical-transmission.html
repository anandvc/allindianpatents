				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MONITORING A THERMAL<br>
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF AN ELECTRO-MECHANICAL<br>
TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]   This disclosure is related to control systems for electro-mechanical<br>
transmissions, and thermal management systems therefor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]   The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003]    Powertrain architectures comprise torque-generative devices,<br>
including internal combustion engines and electric machines, which transmit<br>
torque through a transmission device to an output. One exemplary<br>
transmission is a two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical transmission<br>
which utilizes an input member for receiving motive torque from a prime<br>
mover power source, for example an internal combustion engine, and an<br>
output member for delivering motive torque from the transmission to a vehicle<br>
driveline. Electric machines, operable as motors or generators, generate a<br>
torque input to the transmission, independently of a torque input from the<br>
internal combustion engine. The electric machines may transform vehicle<br>
kinetic energy, transmitted through the vehicle driveline, to electrical energy<br>
potential that is storable in the electrical energy storage device. A control<br>
system monitors various inputs from the vehicle and the operator and provides<br>
operational control of the powertrain system, including controlling<br><br>
transmission operating state and gear shifting, controlling the torque-<br>
generative devices, and regulating the electrical power interchange between<br>
the electrical energy storage device and the electric machines.<br>
[0004]   During operation of the electric machines, heat is generated in the<br>
various electric power devices, including the electric machines, power<br>
inverters, and electrical energy storage devices, e.g., high voltage batteries.<br>
Heat transfer devices, including heat sinks, heat exchangers, and cooling<br>
systems may be incorporated to manage waste heat in the system. Systems<br>
include closed-circuit cooling systems which flow liquid coolant over heat<br>
sinks and pump the coolant through a heat exchanger to remove the waste<br>
heat. Other systems include fan devices which pass air over the heat sink<br>
devices to remove heat therefrom.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]   A method for thermal management of an electric power device<br>
includes monitoring temperature of the electric power device and an ambient<br>
temperature and determining an electric power flow through the electric power<br>
device. A temperature gradient across the electric power device based upon<br>
the monitored temperature of the electric power device is determined. A flow<br>
rate through the heat transfer circuit is estimated and compared to a threshold<br>
flow rate based upon the temperature gradient, the ambient temperature, and<br>
the electric power flow.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0006]    One or more embodiments will now be described, by way of<br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
[0007]    Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present disclosure; and<br>
[0008]   Figs. 2 and 3 are algorithmic flowcharts, in accordance with the<br>
present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0009]   Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating certain exemplary embodiments only and not for the<br>
purpose of limiting the same, Fig. 1 depicts a vehicle system 12 which has<br>
been constructed in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.<br>
The vehicle system 12 comprises an internal combustion engine 14, electro-<br>
mechanical transmission 10, and driveline 92 adapted to transmit tractive<br>
torque to vehicle wheels 90. An electric power system comprises electric<br>
power components or devices including respective first and second electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, an electrical energy storage device ('ESD') 74, and<br>
power electronics circuit 19. The electric machines 56 and 72 comprise<br>
motor/generators, each of which converts electric power to mechanical torque<br>
via the power electronics circuit 19. The ESD 74 comprises a high-voltage<br>
battery system adapted to store electrical energy and transmit electrical power<br>
to the electric machines 56 and 72 via the power electronics circuit 19. The<br>
ESD 74 and electric machines 56 and 72 are electrically-operatively coupled<br>
for electric power flow therebetween. The engine 14, electric machines 56,<br><br>
72, and the electro-mechanical transmission 10 are mechanically-operatively<br>
coupled to transmit mechanical power therebetween to transmit motive torque<br>
to the driveline 92 and vehicle wheels 90 via output shaft 64, and to transmit<br>
mechanical power to one of the electric machines 56 and 72 for electric power<br>
generation via a power splitting device 16. A distributed control module<br>
('CM') 4 is adapted to monitor inputs from a plurality of sensing devices (not<br>
shown) and execute predetermined algorithms stored therein to control<br>
actuators of the various devices to achieve an operator torque request and meet<br>
other parameters related to performance, fuel economy, and emissions, among<br>
others. The exemplary hybrid powertrain system is configured to execute the<br>
control schemes depicted hereinbelow with reference to Figs. 2 and 3, among<br>
various others required for operation of the vehicle system 12.<br>
[0010]    The exemplary engine 14 comprises a multi-cylinder internal<br>
combustion engine selectively operative in several states to transmit torque to<br>
the transmission 10, and can be either a spark-ignition or a compression-<br>
ignition engine. The transmission 10 comprises an electro-mechanical torque-<br>
transmitting device. The exemplary electro-mechanical transmission 10<br>
operates in one of several operating range states comprising fixed gear<br>
operation and continuously variable operation.<br>
[0011]   The first and second electric machines 56 and 72 comprise three-<br>
phase AC machines and include a stator, a rotor, and a resolver assembly, all<br>
not shown. The motor stator for each machine is grounded to an outer portion<br>
of the transmission case, and includes a stator core with coiled electrical<br>
windings extending therefrom. Each resolver assembly comprises a variable<br>
reluctance device including a resolver stator, operatively connected to the<br><br>
[0014]   A heat transfer circuit 96 preferably comprises a closed fluidic circuit<br>
including a heat transfer or fluid/air radiator device 95 that is preferably<br>
separate from a main vehicle radiator 34 used for cooling the engine 14.<br>
However those skilled in the art will recognize that the fluid air radiator device<br>
95 may be incorporated within the main vehicle radiator 34 while remaining<br>
within the scope of that which is claimed. The fluid/air radiator device 95 is<br>
fluidly connected to, and forms a fluid circuit with, a thermal interface device<br>
94 of the power electronics circuit 19 via coolant lines 93. A pump device 91,<br>
such as an electrically actuated pump, pumps or circulates fluid, e.g., an<br>
ethylene glycol based coolant, within the heat transfer circuit 96. The pump<br>
device 91 preferably comprises a variable flow device having a flow rate<br>
controlled via a pulsewidth-modulated electric circuit. Operation of the pump<br>
device 91, and therefore pump flow rate, is preferably controlled via a<br>
pulsewidth-modulated (PWM) signal output from the control module 4 as a<br>
function of operating conditions, e.g., temperature measured at the inverter,<br>
ambient temperature and electrical load. The high-voltage ESD 74 and the<br>
stators of the electric machines 56 and 72 include the thermal interface device<br>
94 that connects to the heat transfer circuit 96, or, alternatively, are on separate<br>
cooling circuits. The thermal interface device 94 preferably comprises a heat<br>
exchange device thermally connected to a coolant manifold (not shown). The<br>
power electronics circuit 19 includes a multi-sectioned housing (not shown in<br>
detail) having an electrical connection for feedthrough of power, control and<br>
data cables in a first section 21, and a fluidic connection for feedthrough of<br>
liquid coolant to the coolant manifold of the thermal interface device 94 in a<br>
second section. The first section 21 of the housing contains the plurality of<br><br>
semiconductor power switching devices (e.g., the IGBTs), not shown. Each of<br>
the semiconductor power switching devices is thermally coupled to the<br>
thermal interface device 94. The thermal interface device 94 preferably<br>
comprises a fin-type radiant heat exchanger located in the housing in a manner<br>
that the fins are exposed in the coolant manifold of the second section, while<br>
the power switching devices are fluidly sealed therefrom, preventing exposing<br>
the power switching devices to the coolant fluid. There are other electronic<br>
devices in the housing, including a plurality of temperature sensing devices 97<br>
and 97' and electrical current sensing devices. The temperature sensors 97<br>
and 97' each monitor one of the plurality of semiconductor power switching<br>
devices to determine temperature states thereof, referred to hereinbelow as<br>
TNJGBT&gt; with N indicating the specific semiconductor power switching<br>
devices. Signal outputs of the temperature sensors 97 and 97' are input to the<br>
control module 4 for analysis. The second section of the housing comprises<br>
the thermal interface device 94, consisting of the fin-type radiant heat<br>
exchanger and the coolant manifold fluidly sealed in the second section of the<br>
housing. The second section of the housing includes a fluidic inlet and outlet,<br>
and the coolant manifold comprises a fluidic passage which exposes the fin-<br>
type radiant heat exchanger to coolant fluid.<br>
[0015]     The volume and frontal area of the fluid/air radiator device 95 and<br>
the flow capacity of the pump device 91 are determined based upon the<br>
amount of heat rejection from the power electronics circuit 19 through the<br>
thermal interface device 94. The fluid/air radiator device 95 is sized such that<br>
the heat generation of the power electronics circuit 19 operating at a low<br><br>
electrical efficiency point is less than system heat rejection through the<br>
fluid/air radiator device 95 at a maximum ambient temperature, e.g., 35-40°C.<br>
[0016J   The control module 4 comprises a distributed control module<br>
architecture which provides coordinated system control of the powertrain<br>
system described herein, and is a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture. The control module 4 synthesizes pertinent information and<br>
inputs, and executes algorithms to control various actuators to achieve control<br>
targets, including such parameters as fuel economy, emissions, performance,<br>
driveability, and protection of hardwaie, including batteries contained within<br>
the ESD 74 and the first and second electric machines 56 and 72. The<br>
distributed architecture preferably includes an engine control module,<br>
transmission control module, battery pack control module, the power<br>
electronics circuit 19, and a hybrid control module, which provides<br>
supervisory control and coordination ofthe aforementioned control modules.<br>
A user interface, not shown, is operatively connected to a plurality of devices<br>
through which a vehicle operator typically controls or directs operation ofthe<br>
powertrain including the transmission 10. Such operator driven control<br>
signals may include an operator torque request and operator brake. Exemplary<br>
input devices to the user interface include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal,<br>
a transmission gear selector, and a vehicle speed cruise control, all of which<br>
are not shown. Each of the aforementioned control modules communicates<br>
with other control modules, sensors, and actuators via a local area network<br>
which allows for structured communication of control parameters and<br>
commands between the various control modules.<br><br>
[0017]   Each of the control modules is preferably a general-purpose digital<br>
computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central processing unit,<br>
storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM), random access<br>
memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory (EPROM),<br>
high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) circuitry,<br>
and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate signal<br>
conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of control<br>
algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations stored in<br>
ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each computer.<br>
Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using a local area network communications bus. Algorithms for<br>
control and state estimation in each of the control modules are typically<br>
executed during preset loop cycles such that each algorithm is executed at<br>
least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the non-volatile memory<br>
devices are executed by one of the central processing units and are operable to<br>
monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute control and diagnostic<br>
routines to control operation of the respective device, using preset calibrations.<br>
Loop cycles are typically executed at regular intervals, for example each<br>
3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during ongoing engine and vehicle<br>
operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be executed in response to<br>
occurrence of an event.<br>
[0018J   A computer program is executed in the control module 4 to monitor<br>
the temperature sensing devices 97 and 97', ambient temperature, and electric<br>
power flow through one or more electric power components or devices. The<br>
electric power devices comprise one of the power electronics circuit 19<br><br>
(having temperature TIGBT_N for N temperature sensors), the motor stator of<br>
one of the electric machines 56 and 72, and the ESD 74. A temperature<br>
gradient across the electric power component is determined based upon input<br>
from the monitored temperature sensing devices. A flow rate through the heat<br>
transfer circuit 96 is estimated based upon the temperature gradient, the<br>
ambient temperature, and the electric power flow. The estimated flow rate<br>
through the heat transfer circuit 96 is compared to a threshold flow rate.<br>
Embodiments of this are now described in detail with reference to Figs. 2 and<br>
3 and with continued reference to Fig. 1.<br>
[0019]   Fig. 2 depicts a first embodiment, comprising control scheme 200,<br>
executable as program code in the control module 4 preferably during one of<br>
the loop cycles. Temperature(s) of one of the electric power devices is<br>
monitored. In the present embodiment of Fig. 2, the electric power device<br>
monitored is the power electronics circuit 19 which is preferably monitored in<br>
a plurality of locations using temperature sensors 97 and 97'. The motor stator<br>
of one of the electric machines 56 and 72, and the ESD 74 may be similarly<br>
monitored. A device temperature (TDEv) is determined to be the maximum of<br>
the plurality of monitored temperatures, or, alternatively, some calculated<br>
average of the plurality of monitored temperature (Step 202).<br>
[0020]   The temperature of the device (TDEV) is compared to a predetermined<br>
upper threshold temperature (TJHD) (Step 204). When the temperature of the<br>
device is less than the predetermined upper threshold temperature, inputs from<br>
the coolant circuit are monitored (Step 206), including electric power to the<br>
pump 91 (PPUMP)5 typically the commanded PWM duty cycle, the ambient<br>
temperature (TAMB) and the electrical load (LOAD). A temperature gradient<br><br><br>
across the electric power device is also determined (ATDEV), comprising a<br>
temperature difference between a maximum output from one of the<br>
temperature sensors 97 or 97' on the device and a minimum output from one<br>
of the temperature sensors 97 or 97' on the device, at a given point in time. A<br>
first coolant flow rate is estimated, comprising a precalibrated coolant flow<br>
rate determined based upon the temperature gradient across the device,<br>
depicted as CFREST. A calibration array for the first precalibrated coolant flow<br>
rate CFREST is preferably generated during testing of the system described, and<br>
stored as an array in one of the memory devices of the control module 4. A<br>
second, threshold coolant flow rate is determined, referred to as CFRTHR, arid<br>
comprises a precalibrated flow which is determined based upon the electric<br>
power to the pump 91 (PPUMP), the ambient temperature (TAMB), and the<br>
electrical load (LOAD) (step 207). The first and second flow rates CFREST<br>
and CFRTHR, respectively, are compared (Step 208). When the first and<br>
second flow rates, CFREST and CFRTHR, are substantially the same, with<br>
allowance for measurement errors and other sources of variation, operation of<br>
the system continues (Step 210). When the first and second flow rates,<br>
CFREST and CFRTHR, vary by an amount greater than allowable measurement<br>
error (Step 208), or the temperature of the electric power device TDEV is less<br>
than the predetermined upper threshold temperature TTHD (from Step 204), a<br>
fault counter is incremented (Step 212). A fault code is set when there are X<br>
faults out of Y observations, i.e., executions of the algorithm in the loop cycle<br>
(Step 216). Depending upon the conditions and requirements, the operator of<br>
the vehicle is notified of the presence of a fault in the heat transfer circuit 96,<br>
and the control module 4 executes a mitigating action to prevent further harm<br><br><br>
or damage to the hardware.   The mitigating action may include adjusting the<br>
PWM control signal to the coolant pump 91 and limiting power output from<br>
the electric machines 56 and 72.<br>
[0021]   Fig. 3 depicts a second embodiment, comprising control scheme 300<br>
executable as program code in the control module 4 during one of the loop<br>
cycles. Temperatures are monitored in the electric power component being<br>
cooled, which comprises the power electronics circuit 19 in this embodiment.<br>
The power electronics circuit 19 is monitored in N locations to determine<br>
temperatures thereof, via temperature sensors 97, 97' located at or near the<br>
IGBTs of the power electronics circuit 19. Load (LOAD) and ambient<br>
temperature (TAMB) are monitored, with load consisting of the power<br>
conducted through the power electronics circuit, typically measured as current<br>
(I) (Step 302). A temperature gradient across the electric power device (+/-<br>
∆TDEV) is calculated, including both a magnitude and a direction of the<br>
gradient (Step 304). The temperature gradient across the electric power device<br>
is normalized (+/- ∆TDEV(Load, TAMB)), based upon the load and the ambient<br>
temperature (Step 306). The normalization removes influences in the<br>
temperature gradient that are based upon system load and ambient<br>
temperature. An estimate of coolant flow rate (CFREST) is determined based<br>
upon the normalized temperature gradient (Step 308). The estimated coolant<br>
flow rate is preferably determined based upon two predetermined calibrations.<br>
The predetermined calibrations comprise a first calibration when the<br>
temperature gradient (+∆TDEV) across the power electronics circuit is positive,<br>
and a second calibration when the temperature gradient (-∆TDEV) across the<br>
power electronics circuit is negative. Each of the predetermined calibrations<br><br><br>
comprises an array of flow rates (CFREST) corresponding to normalized<br>
temperature gradient (+/- ∆TDEV(Load, TVMB) determined during system<br>
development and testing. The estimated flow rate, CFREST, is compared to a<br>
normalized threshold flow rate, CFRTHR.NORMAL (Step 310). The normalized<br>
threshold flow rate, CFRTHR_NORMAL, preferably comprises a scalar value<br>
determined during calibration based upon the PWM control signal to the<br>
coolant pump 91. When the estimated flow rate, CFREST, exceeds the<br>
normalized threshold flow rate, CFRTHR NORMAL, the control scheme 300<br>
determines the heat transfer circuit 96 is operating as intended. When the<br>
estimated flow rate, CFREST, does not exceed the normalized threshold flow<br>
rate, CFRTHR_NORMAL, the control scheme 300 determines the heat transfer<br>
circuit 96 is not operating as intended. A fault counter is incremented, and<br>
when X faults occur in Y observations, or loops (Step 312), a fault code is set<br>
(Step 314). Depending upon the conditions and requirements, the operator of<br>
the vehicle is notified of the presence of the fault, and the control module 4<br>
executes mitigating action to prevent further harm or damage to the hardware.<br>
The mitigating action may include adjusting the PWM control signal to the<br>
coolant pump 91 and limiting power output from the electric machines 56 and<br>
72. In operation, the control system monitors operation of the heat transfer<br>
circuit 96 to identify faults therein and mitigate damage to system<br>
components.<br>
[0022]   The system set forth hereinabove described a heat transfer circuit 96<br>
related to the power electronics circuit 19; however, one skilled in the art will<br>
readily apply the concepts of the disclosure to monitoring one of the electric<br>
machines 56 and 72, or the high-voltage ESD 74.<br><br><br>
[0023]    The disclosure has described certain preferred embodiments and<br>
modifications thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to<br>
others upon reading and understanding the specification. Therefore, it is<br>
intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular embodiment(s)<br>
disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure, but<br>
