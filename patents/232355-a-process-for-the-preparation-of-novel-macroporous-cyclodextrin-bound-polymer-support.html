				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel macroporous cyclodextrin bound polymer support. More particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of macroporous copolymers with functional groups based on cyclodextrin. These are prepared by the modification of macroporous polymers containing epoxy functional groups. The macroporous polymer bound supports with functional groups prepared by the process of this invention can be used to purify cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase under ambient conditions.<br>
The purification of proteins such as cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase can be effected by using conventional techniques such as expended bed column chromatography or packed bed chromatography.<br>
Purification of proteins involves a series of steps - such as clarification, concentration and separation. The operational difficulties encountered are high viscosity of the crude fermentation broth, particulate matter fouling of the membranes and loss encountered in each step in handling etc. affects the high cost of process economics. Cononventional purification of proteins involves the use of suitable support as alumina, olymer or membranes. The polymer support use involves the additional step of crosslinking the base polymer with a crosslinking agent such as gluraraldehyde . Thus polyacrylamides had been used for such applications and is also marketed under the trade name Bio-Gel by M/s Bio-Rad Laboratory; (S. Hjertein Arch. Biochem. Biophys. Suppl 147, 1962); the use of Agarose has been described Stellen Hjerten Biochim. Biophys. Acta79,393, 1964; Dextran gels have been used<br>
as described by Flodin et.al Gels and their applications in Gel filtration, Thesis, University of Uppasala, 1962; Cellulose and its derivatives have also been reported -U S Patent 4, 055, 510 (1977); German Patents DD 29 5861 (1991)<br>
The above polymers suffer from disadvantages such as mechanical stability during the process of operation; resistance to microbial attack; chemical stability under alkaline conditions etc. Additonally, the affinity of the proteins to the support varies and affects the process economics to a great extent.<br>
The polymeric supports prepared as per the process of this invention have affinity towards a particular protein and used directly for the purification of the protein.<br>
The primary requirements for such applications are -<br>
1.	The support material should contain functional groups that have high<br>
affinity/ion exchange capacity to selectively bind proteins from<br>
mixed stream of crude fermentation broth feed.<br>
2.	The support material should have sufficient mechanical strength so<br>
that during the processing stage, there is no damage.<br>
3.	The support materials have densities high enough to allow stable bed<br>
expansion during operation.<br>
4.	The matrix material should be stable to variation in operating pH<br>
range during use.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of novel macroporous cyclodextrin bound polymer support material with<br>
functional groups that are suitable for purification of cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase by<br>
conventional purification techniques.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
macroporous  polymer  bound  support  with  functional   groups  that  has  sufficient<br>
mechanical strength and resistance to variations in pH.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
macroporous polymer matrix with functional groups that can be used repeatedly for<br>
purification of cyclodextrin glycosyl transferase without further derivatization using the<br>
property of affinity of the proteins to the support.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel<br>
macroporous  cyclodextrin  bound  polymer  support charaterized in that contacting  a<br>
macroporous polymer containing epoxy groups with the reaction product of monotosyl P-cyclodextrin and diamine in a aprotic solvent, and stirring the mixture in the range of 150 to 200 rpm at a temperature in the range of 25 to 80°C, for a period ranging from 24 to 96 hours in presence of inert gas, washing the product with the aprotic solvent, separating the solids by conventional methods, washing with an alkanol and drying the product -by<br><br>
under reduced pressure at a temperalure range 40-60oC  methods to get macroporous polymer support.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the macroporous polymer containing hydroxyl groups may be a copolymer of allyl glycidyl either-ethylene glycol<br>
dimethacrylate prepared as described and claimed in our copcnding application no. 1282/DKL/92, derivatives of polymers synthesized using hydroxy ethyl metiuicrylale derivatives, ion exchange resins with hydroxyl functional groups.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the inert gas used may be such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the diamine used may be such as elhylene diamine, hexamethylene diamine, 1,10-dodecanediamine, 1,4 phenylene diamine, 1,3 phenylene diamine, 1,2 phenylene diamine.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the aprotic solvent used may be such as 1,4-dioxan, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethyl formamide, dimethyl acetamide.<br>
