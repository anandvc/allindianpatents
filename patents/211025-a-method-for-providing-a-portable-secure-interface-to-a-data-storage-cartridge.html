WIRELESS SECURITY ACCESS MANAGEMENT FOR A PORTABLE DATA STORAGE CARTRIDGE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the protection of data stored in portable data storage cartridges, and, more particularly, to providing secure access to the data stored in portable data storage cartridges,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Data storage cartridges are typically employed to store data which may be transported between data storage drives and may be stored separately from the data storage drives between uses.  Much of the data must be secured with respect to outsiders, and much of the data must be secured in favor of some users with respect to other users.  Only certain users should be allowed access to certain data, and certain users should be allowed to define who has access to that data.  An example comprises payroll information, and another example comprises financial account information.  Further, the authorized users tend to change over time.<br>
Thus, it is advantageous to not only provide security for data stored in data storage cartridges, but also to manage the access to that data to particular users, and to different users for different data storage cartridges.<br>
Security of data stored in portable data storage cartridges is typically managed by encrypting the data and providing a key for decrypting the data.  Typically, a data processing system includes or obtains the decryption key, and users which are authorized access to the data are listed in the data processing system.  The data processing system provides the key and decrypts the data of the data storage drive accessing the data storage cartridge.  One example is described in U,S, Patent No. 5,857,021 in which permission data is written into the data storage media of the cartridge which contains an encrypted key that is necessary for decrypting the data.  The key can be decoded only with valid IDs of the equipment of the data processing system.  The data processing system thus provides the decrypting key and the user is authorized access by a table in the data processing system.<br><br>
A difficulty is that the access by a user to the data is not portable even though the data storage cartridge is portable.  The access by a user is limited to a data processing system having the authorization table and having the decryption key.<br>
Data processing systems are continually being updated and the authorization tables must be transferred to the new system, and correlated with the data storage media to which access is required.  The management of the authorization table is typically handled by other organizations, such as IS,   than those responsible for the security of the data.  The changes to the table and correlation to the data and to the various data processing systems become a source of loss of security.<br>
WO 97/41562 discloses a data storage medium in the form of a CD which is writable one or more times, the CD consisting of a disk-shaped CD body with a layer for data storage and a chip and a CD coupling element for contact-free transmission of data between the chip and a data processing device.<br>
US 5,065,429 discloses a method and apparatus for granting selected access to information and material provided on storage media, using information encoded in the storage media. The storage media are included in one or more reading devices associated with a computer. A storage accessing device is used in conjunction with the computer to determine whether to grant access by a particular user to specific storage media-The storage media can be subdivided into a plurality of logical zones and access to all or a portion of the material on the storage media is controlled based upon the logical zones to which the user is granted access. Information provided on the storage media includes and index table listing the security identification code, the logical zones to which a particular user is assigned as well as a personal security key used in conjunction with a personal security key provided in a smart card.<br>
US 5, 630,057 discloses a computer system architecture for preventing unauthorized software copying or alteration- The system comprises an interface unit and an independent computer module and this includes a CPU, RAM, ROM, memory switching means, a communications port and a connectorless interface contained within a sealed cartridge.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
This invention is described in preferred embodiments in the<br>
following description with reference to	the Figures, in which like numbers<br>
represent the same or similar elements.	While this invention is described<br>
in terms of the best mode for achieving	this invention's objectives, it<br>
will be appreciated by those skilled in	the art that variations may be<br>
accomplished in view of these teachings	without deviating from the spirit<br>
or scope of the invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a data storage cartridge 10, such as a magnetic tape cartridge (as illustrated) or an optical disk, is loaded into a data storage drive 11.  An example of a data storage cartridge is an IBM 3590 data tape cartridge.  Another example is an LTO (Linear Tape Open) data tape cartridge.<br>
The data storage cartridge has a storage media 12, such as a magnetic tape, that is stored on a tape reel 15 and may be threaded into the data storage drive 11.  As an example, the magnetic tape 12 is threaded past a read/write head 17 to a take-up reel 18.  A drive<br><br>
controller 20, which includes both read/write electronics and control circuitry for operating the drive, is coupled to the read/write head 17 for reading data from, or writing data to, the storage media 12.  The drive controller is also coupled, via an interface 21, to a host 22.  The host may comprise a data processing system or server, or may comprise a drive subsystem controller, for example, for an automated data storage library.  An example of a data storage drive is an IBM 3590 tape storage subsystem.<br>
The data storage drive 11 is modified so that drive controller 20 is also coupled to a wireless interface 25.  The data storage cartridge 10 is also modified to incorporate a wireless interface 26 and a computer processor 30 with a nonvolatile memory 31.<br>
The cartridge wireless interface 26 receives power and data from, and sends data to, the wireless interface 25 of the data storage drive when the data storage cartridge 10 is mounted in the data storage drive 11.  Preferably, the wireless interface 25, 26 is an RF wireless interface.  An example is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,941,201.  A high frequency inductive wireless interface may also be employed, which is of sufficiently high frequency that the magnetic storage media 12 is not adversely affected by the signal.  Examples are described in U.S. Patents No. 4,650,981, No. 4,758,836, and No. 3,859,624,  Alternatively, the inductive antennae for the wireless interface are shielded from the magnetic storage media 12.<br>
The computer processor 30 comprises a microprocessor chip, for example, an Intel Pentium chip arranged to operate in a low power environment, such as a portable computer, and the associated nonvolatile memory 31 is also arranged to operate in a low power environment.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the wireless interface 26 and the computer processor 30 with the associated nonvolatile memory 31 are mounted in, and provide a portable security system for, the portable data storage cartridge 10.  Specifically, the security system, by being mounted in the portable data storage cartridge, becomes portable, accompanying the cartridge at all times.  Thus, the security is no longer exclusively dependent upon the security of the data storage drive 11 and its host system 22, and is not limited to a particular drive or host.  The cartridge may be used with different drives and host systems at varied locations, and may be used with updated drives and updated data processing<br><br>
systems.  Further, the security system may be managed and updated to change access to the data at any of the drives by users which have previously been granted permission via the user or class tables in the data storage cartridge.  The security system remains portable and within the data storage cartridge.<br>
The wireless interface 26 and computer processor 30 are detailed in FIG. 2.  An antenna 35 receives the RF signal from the RF interface of the data storage drive, and coupler 36 supplies the received signal to a power conversion circuit 40, and to a data demodulator 42.  The power conversion circuit 40 converts the received signal to a power current, supplying the current on line 44 to all of the devices in the data storage cartridge requiring power, including the computer processor 30, the data demodulator 42, and a data modulator 45.  The received signal from antenna 35 is encoded, and data demodulator 42 receives the incoming coded signal from coupler 36 and demodulates the signal to provide data signals to the computer processor 30,  Data signals from the computer processor 30 are provided to the data modulator 45 which encodes the signals for transmission by coupler 36 and antenna 35 to the RF interface of the data storage drive.<br>
The computer processor 30 is a programmable computer processor comprising a microprocessor 37 having computer readable program code embodied therein, including an encryption/decryption algorithm 38 and an authorization/authentication/permitted activities algorithm 39.  The nonvolatile storage 31 is employed to store user and class tables, as will be explained.  The nonvolatile storage may comprise a separate chip attached to the programmable computer processor 30 and its microprocessor 37, or may comprise a portion of the same chip.  The computer readable program code may be stored in a nonvolatile internal memory of the computer processor 30 or may also be stored in the nonvolatile memory 31, and loaded into the computer processor 30.  The algorithms 38 and 3 9 may be preloaded into the programmable computer processor 30, or may be supplied to the computer processor at initialization over the wireless interface 26.<br>
The computer processor 30, employing the algorithm 39, provides a user table in nonvolatile memory 31 comprising at least a unique user identifier for each authorized user, which may comprise a user symbol and a corresponding key, and at least one permitted activity the user is authorized to conduct with respect to the data storage media, and provides<br><br>
a class table in nonvolatile memory 31 which has unique class identifier for each authorized class of users, which may comprise a class symbol and a corresponding key, and at least one permitted activity each class of users is authorized to conduct with respect to the data storage media.<br>
In accordance with the predetermined algorithm 39, the user identifier, when combined with a user authentication message from the authorized user, employing the encryption/decryption algorithm 38, authorizes the user.  The computer processor 30 receives user authentication messages from the data storage drive via the wireless interface 26, and combines the user authentication message with the user identifier from the user table in accordance with the predetermined algorithm 39 and encryption/decryption algorithm 38 to authorize or deny the user activity, and transmits the user authorization or denial to the data storage drive via the wireless interface 26.<br>
Herein, the encryption/decryption algorithm 38 comprises any suitable encryption/decryption algorithm which both provides security and portability.  Examples of algorithms which provide security and portability are the "public key" cryptography algorithms.  U.S. Patent No. 4,405,829 describes a "public key" encryption/decryption algorithm that has become a defacto-standard, often called the "RSA" cryptosystem after the names of the authors.  An implementation that provides authentication and allows authorization as employed herein is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,748,668.  Accordingly, the user identifier comprises a user symbol and a user decrypting sender public key.  When combined with a user authentication message from the authorized user that is encrypted by a receiver public key, the user is authorized.  Additionally, with the use of a sender private key and the receiver public key, the authentication message can be encrypted so that, with the use of a receiver private key and the sender public key, the authentication message is both decrypted and the message is known to have come from the sender.<br>
FIGS. 3, 4 and 5 illustrate examples of cartridge initialization with the user and class tables and the operation of the algorithm 39 employing the cryptography algorithm 38.  FIG. 3 illustrates an uninitialized data storage cartridge 10 either without user and class tables, or which has established user and class tables, but which are empty.  FIG. 4 illustrates the data storage cartridge 10 after the user table 50 and the class table 51 have been initialized in accordance with the present invention,<br><br>
As discussed above, the computer processor 30 provides the user table 50 with at least a unique user identifier for each authorized user and at least one permitted activity the user is authorized to conduct with respect to the data storage media.  Preferably, each user identifier in the user table 50 comprises a user symbol 54 and a user decrypting sender public key 55.  The permitted activities 56 of the user may comprise a separate entry for each user identifier and permitted activity that the user is authorized to conduct.  Alternatively, the user table may comprise a separate entry for each user identifier, the entry comprising all of the permitted activities that the user is authorized to conduct.  The user table 50 additionally comprises any class membership 57 of each user, so that the user may be authorized with respect to the class table 51 by the user authorization.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the class table 51 is provided that has an unique class identifier for each authorized class of users, and at least one permitted activity 64 that each class of users is authorized to conduct.  Preferably each class identifier in the class table 51 comprises a class symbol 62 and a class decrypting sender public key 63.  The class identifier, when combined with a user authentication message from a user of the authorized class of users in accordance with the predetermined algorithm, authorizes the user.  Thus, the user u\ay be authorised with respect to the class table either by the class authorisation or by the user authorization 57.<br>
The permitted activities 64 of the members of the class may comprise a separate entry for each class identifier and permitted activity that the user/class member is authorized to conduct.  Alternatively, the class table may comprise a separate entry for each class identifier, the entry comprising all of the permitted activities that the user/class member is authorised to conduct.<br>
The permitted activities 56 in the user table 50 may comprise 1) read access to data stored in the data storage media, 2) write access to data stored in the data storage media, 3) read user entry of the user table, 4) read all entries of the user table, 5) add entries to the user table, 6) change/delete entries to the user table, 7) read class entry of the class table, 8) read all entries of the class table, 9) add entries to the class table, 10) change/delete entries to the class table, and 11) change the receiver private key-<br><br>
The permitted activities 64 in the class table 51 may comprise 1) read access to data stored in the data storage media, 2) write access to data stored in the data storage media, 3) read the user's class entry of the class table, 4) read all entries of the class table, 5) add entry to the class table, 6) change/delete entries to the class table, 7) read all entries of the user table, 8) add entries to the user table, 9) change/delete entries to the user table and 10) change the receiver private key.<br>
The operation of a public key algorithm for authorizing access is illustrated with respect to FIG. 5.  The preferred implementation is one as described above which both allows an authentication message to be decrypted, and also provides a "signature" assuring that the authentication message has come from the sender.  In one example, the user/class symbol will have been sent.  A user/class member generates an authentication message 70.  Preferably, the authentication message includes the request for access to conduct the desired activity, saving a need for a second message.  The user/class member has a sender private key 71 which is employed, together with a receiver public key 72, to encrypt the authentication message.  The receiver public key 72 is made known to the users and class members and is mathematically related to the sender private key, as discussed in the '668 patent, but the message cannot be decrypted with the same keys.  The message instead is only readable by the intended receiver because of the use of the receiver public key.  When decrypted, the message must have therefore been intended for the receiver. Thus, at the cartridge, the algorithm of the computer processor decrypts the message employing a receiver private key 73 and a sender public key 74.  As discussed above, the sender public key has been made available and is kept in the user table or in the class table.  Thus, if the keys decrypt the encrypted authentication message, the message is known to have come from the sender who is the user/class member.  This is known as providing an authentication "signature".<br>
As the result, the user/class member may rely on the security of the portable security system, method, and computer readable program code of a computer program product, of the present invention, which resides in a portable data storage cartridge for managing access to the portable data storage cartridge.<br>
A state diagram of the operation of the computer processor in accordance with the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 6, and flow<br><br>
charts of the method of the present invention are depicted in FIGS. 7 and<br>
Referring to FIGS, 1 and 1,   the initialization of an uninitialized cartridge 10 is initiated at step 80.  The cartridge is loaded into a drive 11 having a wireless interface 25, and, in step 81, the initialization information is transmitted to the cartridge.  The initialization information is not encrypted, and is provided when in a secure situation.  The cartridge wireless interface 26 receives the initialization information in step 82 and provides the information to the cartridge processor 30.  As discussed above, the initialization information comprises the user and class tables.  The cartridge processor 30, in step 83, recognizes that the input from the wireless interface is initialization information, and determines whether the cartridge is uninitialized.  If the cartridge has been initialized previously, a message is sent to the drive 11 over the wireless interface, in step 84, denying the initialization.<br>
If the cartridge is uninitialized, an initializing drive or host computer provides the user table to the cartridge computer processor 30 in step 85 and provides the class table in step 86, both via the wireless interface.  The receiver private key may have been provided previously, or, as an optional step 87, may be provided in the initialization load. The initialization is then complete, and the drive is informed of the completion in step 89.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1, 6 and 8, an authentication or an access request is initiated in step 90, e.g., by sending the user symbol, and the cartridge computer processor 30 is initially in an idle state 91.  In step 93, the request is received at the wireless interface 26 and is provided to the computer processor.  The computer processor moves to state 94 and, in step 95, determines whether the requesting user or class member is in the list of the user or class table.  If not in the table/ the computer processor 30, in step 96, moves to state 97 and denies access to the user/class member via the wireless interface 2 6.<br>
If the user or class member is in the respective table, the computer processor, in step 98, moves to state 99 and requests the authentication message from the user or class member.  The computer processor moves to state 100 while awaiting the authentication message, and, if the message is not received in a time out period, denies access in state 97.  In step 102, the authentication message is received by the wireless interface 26<br><br>
and forwarded to the computer processor 30.  As discussed above, the authentication message is encrypted by the sender private key and the receiver (cartridge) public key.  The computer processor moves to state 103, receiving the message and beginning the authentication.  In step 105, the computer processor conducts the decryption of the authentication message employing the receiver private key and employing the sender public key from the user or class   table.  In step 106, the computer processor determines whether the user or class member is authorized.  If not, the computer processor 30 moves to state 97 and, in step 96,   denies access.<br>
If the user or class member is authorized, the computer processor moves to state 98 and, in step 110, reads the user or class table for the permitted activities for the user/class member.  As discussed above, the authentication message preferably includes a request to conduct one  or more activities.  Based on the permitted activities of the user or class table and the request, the computer processor moves to state 111 or to state 112 to grant the permitted activity.  The permission to change the receiver private key will be very limited to a particular user or to a particular class.  Thus, the grant of the permitted activities of state 111 are transmitted in step 114 to the drive 11 over the wireless interface.  As an example, the requested access from state 111 does not require a decrypting key for the data, such as changing an entry to the user table.  State 112 is entered only in response to a specific request by  the user/class member, and, in step 114, the decrypting key for the data on the cartridge data storage media is transmitted to the drive 11 from the cartridge 10 over the wireless interface 26.  The computer processor then moves back to the idle state 91, and the data may be read.<br>
As specific security examples, read access to the data stored in the data storage media is controlled by the computer processor 30 in the portable cartridge through the decrypting key; table access is enforced by the computer processor 30 in the portable cartridge; and write access is controlled logically in the drive, which may be under the logical control of the processor.
