During the last four decades, there has been tremendous increase in the frequency of fungal infections. Current drugs for the treatment of fungal infections include amphotericin B and a variety of azoles. Amphotericin B is reported to be toxic to humans and clinical resistance to azoles is increasing. Therefore there is need to screen for new drugs with high efficacy, low toxicity and to which microbes are unlikely to develop resistance.<br>
Since the compounds having structural formula (1) and (2) have not been reported in the literature, there is no known process at present for their synthesis. The inventors are reporting a new process for the synthesis of these novel dimeric steroids having structural formulae (1) and (2) for the first time.<br>

Example 3<br>
This example illustrates the antifungal activity of the compounds of the present invention. PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION<br>
Antifungal Activity. Materials and Methods: Candida albicans (5 isolates), Benjaminiella poitrasii and Yarrowia lipolytica maintained on Difco Yeast extract peptone glucose agar slants at 28 °C for 7 days. C albicans and Y. lipolytica were inoculated in YPG broth at 28 °C and B. poitrasii at 37 ° C for 24 hours. Compounds (1) and (2) were solubilized in DMSO and stock solution of 1 mg/ml was prepared. Cycloheximide, a standard inhibitor, was also dissolved in DMSO and varying concentrations were added on to the filter paper discs.<br>
Antibiotic inhibition assay using disc method: 100 µL of the yeast cell suspensions for all five C. albicans isolates, B. poitrasii and Y. lipolytica were spread plated on sterile YPG agar plates separately. Five sterile whatman filter paper discs were placed on each plate. To the central disc, DMSO was added as the control and to other four discs, different concentrations of the compounds were added. The plates were then incubated at 28 °C for 24 hours and were observed for the zone of inhibition around the disc. The minimum concentration that gave the zone of inhibition was determined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the compound for that fungal culture. All the experiments were done in triplicates. Similar procedure was followed to determine the MIC of cycloheximide.<br>
Antifungal Activity. Compounds (1) and (2) were examined for antifungal activity. The MIC for compound (1) is 11.32 nM for all five C. albicans isolates, B. poitrassi and Y. lipolytica, the MIC values for the compound (2) ranged between 10-25 nM. However, in case of cycloheximide, the MIC value is much higher and ranged between 250-500 nM for isolates of C. albicans. In a microtitre dilution broth assay, the MIC of cycloheximide against a clinical isolate of C. albicans was reported to be greater than 900 nM. MIC of cycloheximide was 71 nM in B. poitrasii and 106 nM in Y. lipolytica.<br>
Table 1. In Vitro antifungal activities of compounds (1), (2) and cycloheximide.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The difference in the toxicity of cycloheximide towards C. albicans, a pathogenic fungus and B. poitrasii and Y. lipolytica, non-pathogenic fungi can be attributed to the differences in their cell wall composition that affects the passage of the compound through the fungal cell wall. DMSO did not show any zone of inhibition. The results suggest that the compounds (1) and (2) have potential as antifungal agents when compared to the standard inhibitor cycloheximide, when tested against both the pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic fungi.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
