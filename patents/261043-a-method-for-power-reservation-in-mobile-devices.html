				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates in general to the field of mobile and other handheld devices. Further, this invention is applicable to power management in mobile handsets, smart phones and other similar handheld devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a system and method for power reservation in mobile and other handheld devices.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There is always a high need for on demand power for the mobile users who travel to the locations where battery charging facility is not available.<br>
When the low battery warning comes, after that, power rich features like Camera, Music player, FM Radio etc., will not be started due to power constraint.<br>
There is no way currently to identify when the low battery will occur, so that before hand we can use power rich features.<br>
Currently user gets the battery-low indication when the battery's remaining power goes below the threshold value set by the manufacturer. Even though Ul Bars (battery annunciators) indicate the power remaining, they are not reliable.<br><br>
Even though currently there is no way to reserve the battery power for future use, as a part of efficient power management process, 'Power save' mode is employed wherein the mobile enters the low power profile by temporarily turning off LCD, keypad backlights.<br>
There is no way currently to identify when the low battery will occur, so that before hand we can use power rich features.<br>
'Power save' mode as its name implies, it is only for preserving the power, not to reserve it. So user always has to have an eye on the battery level. If the user does not monitor the battery level, occasional moments may be missed from being captured.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Even though today's available mobiles provide a way to preserve the battery power by 'Power Save Mode', they don't have the facility to reserve the battery power for future use.<br>
This invention provides the user with the ability to reserve the battery power for his/her future use. This system will ensure that the user does not miss his/her occasional moments because of sudden unavailability of battery power.<br><br>
The proposed system provides the user with a means to reserve the battery power for future use as follows:<br>
{Throughout this document the terms 'Power rich feature' and 'Device' are interchangeably used-)<br>
At any point of time the user can specify which power rich feature for how long to be used in future.<br>
Then mobile will calculate the threshold value required to use these power rich feature for the specified duration based on the device (power hch feature) power profile. If this is lower than the current available power, then this will be set.<br>
Otherwise mobile helps the user in power reservation by providing guidance.<br>
Mobile will advise the user that his/her power need can be reserved only for x seconds or to try changing his/her device profile<br>
Upon setting, other power rich features can be optionally turned off by the user.<br><br>
2<br>
After this when the mobile reaches the threshold value of the reserved power, it will alert the user about the reserved power rich features usage. Now user can decide his/her usage.<br><br>
According to this invention, user is ensured of the power availability for important features at important times<br>
©  User gets the don't-miss opportunity<br>
©  Unique user controlled power usage<br>
®  User gets guidance from mobile for power reservation during crucial power situations<br>
©  Device profiles for optimum power usage<br>
©  User customizable device profiles<br>
Unique product differentiator Extensibility<br>
^  This feature can be extended/applied for normal use also, to reserve the<br>
power for later use. I.e. User can reserve the battery power for specific<br>
duration from the available power for future use. ^  This can be done on low-end phones also Keep in touch As a value added feature, user can be provided with the current battery level in a more accurate way.<br>
i.e. Current battery level value scaled to 100 can be displayed as one of the annunciators so that user also can keep a tab on the battery level to know when to reserve<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for power reservation in a mobile<br>
device comprising the steps of:<br>
giving the input for power reservation by the user;<br><br>
calculating the required power to reserve by the mobile device with regard to the<br>
given inputs;<br>
reserving the calculated power based on the availability by the mobile device;<br>
providing guidance to the user to facilitate the power reservation by the mobile<br>
device;<br>
optionally allowing the user to   turn off other power rich features by the mobile device;<br>
alerting the user of reserved power by the mobile device; and<br>
taking a decision on the reserved power by the user as per the alert from the mobile<br>
device.<br>
Giving the input for power reservation by the user involves selecting the power rich feature and specifying the length of duration in seconds for use by the user. To get the input from the user, a new menu 'Power Reservation' is provided in the Ul which list down the power hch features. The user interface for the said 'Power reservation' feature has multiple menu levels which indicate Power Reservation, Devices, Profiles and submenu for entering the duration in seconds. For calculating the required power to reserve by the mobile device the mobile uses 'Device Profiles' for various devices with regard to the given inputs by the user. For optimum power usage of a device, the said device's various settings levels are organized into 'Profiles'. For calculating the required power to reserve by the mobile device a Device_Profile_Power_Calibration_Procedure is performed.<br>
Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure involves<br><br>
reading the current battery power; starting the mobile device with the selected profile; reading the current battery power after 1 second; and calculating the difference between these two readings ,<br>
wherein, for the device, with the current device profile, the power need for the specified length of duration X seconds is given by<br>
Device_run_power_Xsec	=	Device_start_power<br>
(Device_settings_power_1sec * X)<br>
If the calculated power is lower than the current available power, then mobile stores this power reservation data in memory. If the calculated power is higher than the current available power, then the mobile guides the user through the alert where to provide the said alert information, mobile calculates the power requirement for different profiles when user selects them.<br>
Available_power_for_reservation (in seconds) =<br>
Current_available__power / Device_settings_power_1sec<br>
Where<br>
DeviCe_SettingS_pOWer_1SeC = P0Wer_1seC Device current profile<br>
When the mobile reaches the threshold value of the reserved power the said mobile alerts the user to use the remaining power with the power reservation data. The<br><br>
user either uses the reserved power for the reserved purpose or switch off the mobile to use the reserved power later.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for power reservation in a<br>
mobile device comprising:<br>
means for giving the input for power reservation by the user;<br>
means for calculating the required power to reserve by the mobile device with regard to the given inputs;<br>
means for reserving the calculated power based on the availability by the mobile device;<br>
means for providing guidance to the user to facilitate the power reservation by the mobile device;<br>
means for optionally allowing the user to turn off other power rich features by the mobile device;<br>
means for alerting the user of reserved power by the mobile device; and<br>
means for taking a decision on the reserved power by the user as per the alert from the mobile device.<br><br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the<br><br>
claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed system reserves the battery power of a mobile for future use as per the following mechanism described:<br>
Step 1:<br>
User gives the input for power reservation<br>
Input from user:<br>
1.Selecting the power rich feature<br>
2.Specifying the length of duration in seconds for use<br>
^  To get the input from the user, a new menu 'Power Reservation' will be<br>
provided in the Ul. ^   This menu will list down the power rich features<br>
User interface for this 'Power reservation' feature will have the form as follows Menu level 1: Power Reservation<br>
Menu level 2: Devices 1.Camera 2.Music player<br><br>
3.FM Radio<br>
(Will include other power rich features in future)<br>
Menu level 3: Profiles<br>
List of profiles for the selected device<br>
Menu level 4:<br>
Enter the duration In seconds<br>
Step 2:<br>
Mobile calculates the required power to reserve<br>
For calculation of power, mobile uses 'Device Profiles' for various devices.<br>
Device Profile<br>
For optimum power usage of a device, its various settings levels are organized into 'Profiles'<br>
Ex: For Camera device, the profiles are<br>
?	Indoor<br>
?	Sunlight<br>
?	Cloudy<br>
?	Night<br><br>
To start with the calculation, we take the case of Camera device.<br>
After the low battery warning comes, then camera cannot be started.<br>
So it is assumed that the minimum power required to start the camera is the low<br>
battery threshold itself.<br>
camera_start_power = low_battery_thresold<br>
So the power need is calculated based on the camera profile user selects.<br>
Initially, these profiles will have default values. At any time, user can update these profiles by modifying the following attributes:<br>
?	Quality (High, Medium, Low)<br>
?	Image size (640:480, 320:240,160:120, 128:96)  P'Flash (On, Off)^ Zoom (On, Off)<br>
?	Co/or (High, Medium, Low)<br>
?	Shutter sound<br>
So first to keep the camera on (running) for 1 sec, the power need is calculated<br>
as follows<br>
For ex: PoweMsecjndoor is the battery power calculated<br>
by running the camera in indoor profile for 1 second<br><br>
Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure:<br>
IRead the current battery power<br>
2.Start the camera with the Indoor profile<br>
3.After 1 second, read the current battery power<br>
4. Difference between these two readings is the Power_1secindoorEffectlvely<br>
the Power_1sec|ndoor becomes<br>
Power_1sec|ndoor   =<br>
Power_1secqualityJndoor        +<br>
Power_1secimage_size_indoor +<br>
Power_1secfiashJndoor<br>
Power_1seczoomJndoor<br>
Powerjseccolorjndoor<br>
Power_1secshutter_soundJndoor<br>
The     same     way     Power_1secsunlight     ,      Power_1seccloudy<br>
Power_1secnight are also calculated.<br>
With default setting, these will be the factory set values.<br>
But whenever user updates any of these profiles by modifying the<br>
attributes values, then<br>
the mobile will perform self power calibration for the updated profile bv the<br>
Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure, So to keep the camera on<br>
(running) for 1 sec the<br>
power need is<br><br>
Camera_settings_power_1sec	=   Power_1seccurrent_camera_profile<br>
where<br>
Power_1seccurrent_camera_profile   =<br>
Power_1secindoor	or<br>
Power_1secsunlight        or<br>
Power_1seccloudy	or<br>
Power_1secnight<br>
Camera_run_power_Xsec	=	Camera_start_power<br>
(Camera_settings_power_1sec * X)<br>
So the generalized form for all the devices is<br>
Device_run_power_Xsec	=	Device_start_power<br>
(Device_settings_power_1sec * X)<br>
Step 3:<br>
Mobile reserves the calculated power based on the availability<br>
If the calculated power is lower than the current available power, then mobile stores this power reservation data in memory.<br>
Step 4:<br><br>
Mobile provides guidance to the user to facilitate the power reservation If<br>
the calculated power is higher than the current available power, then the mobile guides the user thro' the alert saying that<br>
With the current device profile, power can be rese/ved|<br>
only for X seconds from now on.<br>
Otherwise try with other profile.<br>
To provide this alert information, mobile calculates the power requirement for different profiles when user selects them.<br>
Available_power_for_reservation (in seconds) =<br>
Current_available_power / Device_settings_power_1sec<br>
Where<br>
Device,settings_power,1sec = Powerjsec peyjce current profii.<br>
Step 5:<br>
Mobile allows the user to optionally turn off other power rich features<br>
For this mobile prompts the user saying that<br>
Vo you want to turn off other power rich featuresTlf 'Yes', then the list of other<br>
power rich features is shown to turn off.<br>
The user interface for this will have the form as follows<br>
Turn off power rich features<br>
□   Camera<br><br>
n<br>
Music player<br>
D<br>
FM Radio (Will list other devices in future) Now user can check the device to turn it off.<br>
Step 6:<br>
Mobile alerts the user of reserved power<br>
When the mobile reaches the threshold value of the reserved power i.e. only the reserved power is remaining,<br>
It will alert the user to use the remaining power with the power reservation data as follows<br>
Use the remaining power for <device> for X seconds<br>
Step 7:<br>
User takes decision on the reserved power<br>
Now the user can either use the reserved power for the reserved purpose or switch off the mobile to use the reserved power later. All the cases, the power is made available without fail.<br>
STRUCTURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention introduces the concept of calculation of power need for a device to<br><br>
run for a specified length of duration.<br>
Here device refers to power rich features in a mobile like Camera, Music Player, FM Radio etc.<br>
To calculate the device run power, first the low battery threshold value is taken as the device start power as after the low battery warning came, power rich features cannot be started.<br>
After that, device settings power for a second, with a particular profile is calculated. For the length of the length to use, this device settings power is multiplied by X seconds.<br>
Then the final device run power is arrived by adding the device start power with device settings power for the specified length of the period.<br>
Also this invention introduces the concept of 'Device Power Profile Calibration' to determine the power need of a device profile.<br>
With default setting, these device profiles will have the factory set values.<br>
But whenever user updates any of these profiles by modifying the attributes values, then the mobile will perform self power calibration for the updated profile by the Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure.<br><br>
Also this invention introduces the concept of calculating the available power for reservation in terms of seconds with the current device profile. When the user selects a different profile of a device, mobile automatically calculates the available power for reservation in terms of seconds by dividing the available power by power need of the current device profile for 1 second.<br>
OPERATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1a is a flow chart explaining the operation of the present invention.<br>
1 Start.<br>
2. User selects the power rich feature and specifies the duration of use.<br>
S.Mobile calculates the threshold value power required to use it.<br>
4.A check is made to confirm if threshold power is lower than the current power.<br>
Figure lb is the continuation of the flowchart.<br>
If the threshold power is lower<br>
1.A check is made to confirm to Turn off other power rich feature(s)?<br>
2. If turn off required the user selects other power rich feature(s) to turn off.<br>
S.Mobile turns off the selected power rich feature(s).<br>
4. Mobile stores this power reservation data in memory.<br><br>
Figure 1c is the continuation of the flowchart.<br>
If the threshold power is high<br>
1.Mobile calculates the power available for reservation (in seconds).<br>
2. Mobile provides guidance to user thro' alert: With current power profile, power<br>
can be reserved only for X seconds Or Try changing.<br>
Figure 2 shows the way of mobile providing the user with alert for the use of the reserved power for the reserved purpose<br>
1. Start<br>
2.Every second, Mobile checks the current battery level against the threshold<br>
power in the power reservation data.<br>
3. Check if Current power = Threshold power.<br>
4.Mobile alerts the user to use the reserved power: Use the reserved power for<br>
Power rich feature for X seconds Or Switch off the mobile for later use.<br>
5. Now User decides the usage.<br>
Figure 3 shows the way of mobile performing the self-power calibration for the updated profile by the Device Profile Power Calibration procedure.<br>
1. Start<br><br>
2. User updates a device profile by modifying its attributes values S.Mobile performs the self power calculation for the updated profile by the<br>
'Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure' 4.End<br>
The operation of this invention is as follows:<br>
When the user wants to use any power rich feature available on the mobile for some time in future and not sure about when exactly to use, then the user can avail of this power reservation facility on the mobile to reserve the battery power for his/her future use of a power rich feature.<br>
First the user gives his/her input by selecting the power rich feature to use and the length of the duration in seconds for future use. The power rich feature can be Camera, Music player, FM Radio etc..<br>
Now the mobile calculates the threshold value of power required to run this power hch feature in future.<br>
For the optimum power usage of a device (power rich feature), different settings levels have been organized into 'Profiles'. For example, for Camera device, the profiles are Indoor, Sunlight. Cloudy and Night. Here each profile will have different power consumption based on the device settings.<br><br>
With default setting, tliese profiles will have the factory set values.<br>
But whenever user updates any of these profiles by modifying the attributes values, then the mobile will perform self power calibration for the updated profile by the Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure.<br>
For ex: Power_1secindoor is the battery power calculated by running the camera in indoor profile for 1 second<br>
Device Profile Power Calibration Procedure;<br>
I.Read the current battery power<br>
2.Start the camera with the Indoor profile<br>
S.After 1 second, read the current battery power<br>
4.Difference between these two readings is the Power_1secindoor<br>
So the mobile, for the selected power rich feature (device), with the current device profile, will calculate the power need for the specified length of duration.<br>
Device_run_power_Xsec	=	Device_start_power<br>
(Device_settings_power_1sec * X)<br>
If this power need is lower than the current available power, then power reservation request is successfully stored with the power reservation data in mobile's memory.<br>
Otherwise mobile provides guidance to the user through the alert message saying<br><br>
that<br>
'With the current device profile, power can be reserved only for X seconds,<br>
otherwise try changing the device profile'.<br>
When the user selects different profile for this device (power rich feature), the mobile provides information to the user through the alert saying that<br>
'With the current device profile, power can be reserved only for X seconds, otherwise try changing the device profile'.<br>
To provide this information, mobile calculates the available power for reservation with the current profile as follows<br><br>
Current_available_power Devlce_settings_power_1sec<br>
Where<br>
Device_settings_power_1sec = Power_1secDevice_current profile<br>
Now onwards every second, the mobile will be checking the current battery power against the threshold power in the power reservation data.<br>
If the current battery power is equal to the threshold power in the power reservation<br><br>
data then the mobile alerts the user about his/her power reservation as follows<br>
Use the remaining power for <device> for X seconds<br>
EFFECTS / ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
This feature will make the 'World's first' mobile with the capability of power reservation.<br>
As of now, no phone in the world is capable of reserving the battery power but only of preserving the battery power.<br>
User will find an immense use of this feature on high-end phones, which boast of power rich features like Camera, Music player, FM Radio and a plenty of video games.<br>
Also the user is ensured of power availability for important features at important times.<br>
Hence this feature will surely make the phone a key product differentiator thereby bringing a record profit to the manufacturer<br>
ALTERNATIVES<br><br>
Instead of reserving the power for power rich feature only, alternatively power can be reserved for normal use also.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br>
