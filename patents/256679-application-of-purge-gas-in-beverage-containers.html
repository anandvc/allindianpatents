Application of Purge Gas in Beverage Containers<br>
The invention relates to a device for applying a purge gas or flushing gas in containers (2),<br>
particularly beverage containers, which are to be filled with foodstuff.<br>
In case of bottles to be filled with comestibles, e.g. beverages, it is known, that O2-containing air<br>
is to be purged by evacuation and subsequent rinsing with CO2. If one applied this known<br>
technology in beverage cans that are to be filled, this had led to evacuation step, in which the<br>
very thin-walled beverage cans would be imploded and would thus become useless.<br>
Another method consists of the fact that the cans are effectively rinsed with CO2. This leads to<br>
the desired rinsing results; however this method has the great disadvantage that in direct<br>
vicinity of the corresponding unit a concentration of CO2 arises, so that the machine operator is<br>
exposed to a very high MAK-value (threshold limit value).<br>
Here the object of the invention is to create a device, with which an optimum rinsing effect can<br>
be achieved in case of cans to be filled with comestibles, without exposing the environment to<br>
high CO2-values.<br>
With a device of the type as described before, this task can be achieved by the characterizing<br>
features of claim 1, namely through a socket, which can be raised or lowered, attached to the<br>
upper edge of can by means of a seal, in which a purge gas pipe is designed that can be raised<br>
and lowered, and which is fitted with a gas discharge line.<br><br>
The advantage of the present invention lies in enabling the application of purge gas in the<br>
ground level of the can in a stationary, open can filled with ambient air by means of purge gas<br>
pipe that can be raised and lowered, whereby this purge gas/air mixture can be removed via a<br>
gas discharge line.<br>
There is also the possibility to regenerate, if necessary the purge gas/air mixture again and to<br>
recycle the purge gas into the cycle. In addition, it is possible to dispose of the purge gas/air<br>
mixture through the hall roof. In both cases, the surrounding area of the operator is<br>
considerably improved by a suitably equipped machine, since it is not charged with CO2 or<br>
purge gas smog.<br>
The atmosphere within the can is essentially improved, thus the possibility of oxygen intake<br>
and/or foreign gas intake is minimized during the subsequent filling procedure, which leads to<br>
an improvement of the quality of the final product.<br>
Embodiments of the invention result from the subordinate claims.<br>
The cylinder carrying the purge tube is suitably surrounded from outside by a socket sealed<br>
opposite this cylinder, which is laid on the upper edge of socket during purging with its sealing<br>
edge. If the cylinder shows two areas with different diameter, then a ring collar results in such a<br>
manner that this area can be used to form the starting of the discharge gas line.<br>
The end region of the cylindrical valve body tapered in diameter is arranged in such a way that<br>
an annular gap between the end region of the socket carrying the edge seal and the valve<br>
cylinder is formed for removing the purge gas/air mixture as discussed above.<br>
In order to improve the purging and accelerate a vacuum pump foreseen at the discharge gas<br>
line.<br>
The appropriate method of purging according to the invention consists of the fact that a socket<br>
provided with an edge seal is lowered on to the top edge of a can to be rinsed and positioned<br>
against this seating; subsequently a valve cylinder supporting the purge gas supply pipe and a<br>
discharge gas line is lowered so far into the can that the outlet of the purge tube is located<br>
within the can base where a gas outlet area is left open and subsequently the purge gas supply<br>
and the discharge gas line is kept open till the can is completely filled with purge gas.<br>
A further improvement can consist of the fact that the purge gas air mixture is drawn off during<br>
purging with the help of a vacuum pump synchronized with purge gas supply.<br>
Further characteristics, details and advantages of the invention result in based on the following<br>
description as well as the drawing. This shows a partially simplified diagram of said device in<br>
purging position.<br>
The device generally designated with Iserves for bringing in a purge gas or flushing gas in<br>
cans 2 to be filled with comestibles. In order to fill the can 2 with purge gas, socket 4 provided<br>
with a lower ring seal 3 is pressed on the edge of the can designated with 2a, whereby the can<br><br>
rests on an appropriate support 5. The lowering and lifting of the socket 4 is characterized with<br>
a lifting and lowering mechanism shown with a double arrow 6, though not clearly represented.<br>
A socket 4 that can be lifted and lowered is guided at the cylinder 7, which is sealed gas-tight<br>
sealed vis-a-vis cylinder 7 by means of seals 8.<br>
In the cylinder 7 a purge gas pipe 9 is centrically positioned. On the outer edge-side, one or<br>
more discharge gas lines 10 are positioned, which are provided with a vacuum pump 11. The<br>
purge gas pipe 9 is lowered into the bottom region 2b of can 2, so far that CO2 can escape from<br>
there.<br>
The valve as foreseen in the purge gas pipe is designated with 12 in the figure; the valve in the<br>
discharge gas line is marked with 13. The double arrow characterizing the lifting and lowering is<br>
marked with 14 in the purge gas pipe 9.<br>
The mode of working of said device is as follows:<br>
Can 2 to be filled with comestibles is mounted to the position of said device via a support and/or<br>
a transport element 5. If the can 2 is located in the concerned position, socket 4 is lowered<br>
(double arrow 6) via a device, not shown clearly, over the can till it seizes the upper edge of can<br>
2a with its ring seal 3 and seals the latter this against the environment.<br>
Synchronous with or separated by this downward movement as per the double arrow 6 the<br>
purge gas pipe 9 led in the cylinder 7 is lowered into the can 2 (double arrow 14). The cylinder<br>
7 is equipped at its end pointing in the direction of the can 2 with a range 7a of smaller<br>
diameter, so that the gas escaping during purging from the can in functional position of the<br>
cylinder 7 can be drawn off by means of the vacuum pump 11 through the discharge gas line<br>
10.<br>
For charging the can inside with purge gas, valve 12 is opened, at the same time, valve 13 of<br>
the discharge gas line and if necessary, vacuum pump 11 are operated.<br>
The purging method is time-controlled and ends with discharge of the pre-selected time<br>
interval. In addition, the purge gas pipe valve 12 and the discharge gas line valve are closed,<br>
on which further process steps follow for the purpose of filling the can. Upon completion of<br>
filling of the can, socket 4 is taken off the can, the can, filled now, can be further guided into<br>
other process steps, e.g. locking.<br>
In addition to time-controlled termination of purging, a sensor-controlled steering of purging can<br>
be foreseen. Thus, sensors can be provided for gas pressure or for determining the purge gas<br>
concentration, which upon reaching the specified setpoint trigger the completion of purging.<br><br>
