RADIO FREQUENCY TRANSCEIVER SYSTEM FOR DIGITAL<br>
COMMUNICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to wireless telecommunications. More particularly, the present invention relates to a radio frequency transceiver system for interfacing radio frequency signals with digital modems used for wireless telecommunication.<br>
II.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Wireless telephone systems provide telephone service via the use of a subscriber unit and base station that communicate with each other using radio frequency (RF) signals. The subscriber unit provides an individual, called a "subscriber", with an interface to the base station and the base station provides the subscriber unit with an interface to a call processing center. Cellular wireless telephone systems incorporate the use of multiple base stations scattered over a given area thereby allowing the subscriber unit to be used in a highly mobile fashion. The subscriber unit often resembles a compact telephone hand-set having an antenna, and is normally carried by the subscriber during operation to make and receive telephone calls in a completely mobile fashion.<br>
Digital wireless telephone systems process and transmit the data associated with a communication session or phone call in various specialized maimers in order to utilize the available RF bandwidth more efficiently than analog wireless telephone systems. In order to accomplish this processing the subscriber unit for a digital wireless telephone system includes a modem that converts both voice and data information between analog and digital signal formats, and an RF transceiver system including an antenna and RF signal processing circuitry. The modem is configured to properly demodulate signals provided by the transceiver system that are within a range of decibel (dB) levels that correspond to the range of distances from the base station in which the subscriber unit is expected to operate.<br>
Code division multiple- access.... (CDMA) digital wireless telecommunication systems, well known in the art, place the RF signals<br><br>
used for communication in a spread spectrum waveform via the use of a spreading code in order to further increase RF bandwidth efficiency of the system. Within some CDMA digital wireless telecommunication systems the strength of the outgoing signal is varied substantially over time in a tightly controlled manner to reduce the interference between RF signals generated by the various subscriber units. This allows the maximum number of communication sessions to be carried out over a given amount of RF bandwidth. Because of this substantial amount of power variation, however, power limiting is also performed to ensure that the transceiver system is not damaged from overloading. One implementation of such power limiting is described in US patent application serial number 08/203,151 entitled "Reverse Link, Transmit Power Correction and Limitation in a Radiotelephone System" filed March 3, 1993 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Both the power limiting functions and the power control functions require that the modem and the RF transceiver system interface via various control signals since both play a part in the determining the strength of the outgoing RF signal.<br>
The transceiver system and modem that make up a subscriber unit for a digital wireless telephone system are generally kept in close proximity to each other during operation. This is done primarily to4 keep the subscriber unit compact for purposes of nobility, which has traditionally been the main advantage of wireless telephone systems. Other advantages are also provided by the compact configuration, however. One advantage is that keeping the length of the connections between the systems that make up the subscriber unit small reduces the sensitivity to environmental variations of the subscriber unit. This reduces the concern that these environmental parameters will affect the performance of the subscriber unit. Another advantage is that the signal processing circuitry within the transceiver system is located in close proximity to the antenna. This allows the incoming, or receive (Rx), signal to be processed after reception by the antenna with as little signal loss and noise introduction as possible. Finally, keeping the subscriber unit compact facilitates the exchange of control signals between the modem and the transceiver system. This allows the two systems to cooperate when performing various functions including the power limiting function described above within the context of a CDMA wireless telephone system.<br>
Compact configuration of the subscriber unit does not necessarily provide for optimal transmission and reception of the RF signals used to conduct wireless communication, however.   This is because the subscriber<br><br>
unit is normally located near the subscriber during use, and the subscriber is often in a poor location for the reception and transmission of RF signals including within a building or behind a hill. This less than optimal placement of the transceiver systems is tolerated, however, because of the various benefits created by compact configuration of the subscriber unit described above, including mobility.<br>
In some wireless telecommunications systems, however mobility is not a primary concern.    Such a system is described in co-pending US patent<br>
application serial number  entitled  "Concentrated  Subscriber<br>
System for Wireless Local Loop" filed on January 31, 1995 and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The concentrated subscriber system provides wireless telephone service at a reduced cost when compared to previous wireless telephone systems by allowing multiple subscribers to interface with a base station via RF signals using a set of shared modems and a transceiver system. In the preferred embodiment the modems used within the subscriber system are the same or similar to those used in prior art mobile subscriber units so that the development cost of the concentrated subscriber system is reduced. The concentrated subscriber system is placed in a fixed location during use that can be within as great or greater range of distances from the base station than those experienced by the prior art mobile subscriber unit. This is because the concentrated subscriber unit is intended to provide inexpensive non-mobile telephone service both in areas where mobile telephone service is and is not available, and therefore in areas where a base station may or may not be close by. In the preferred embodiment the concentrated subscriber system incorporates the use of CDMA wireless telephone system technology.<br>
Because the concentrated subscriber system is not mobile during use there is no need for compactness as with the prior art mobile subscriber unit. Therefore, the reception of the concentrated subscriber system can be improved by positioning the antenna away from the subscriber in a location having improved RF signal transmission and reception capability. In order for such a configuration to operate properly within a digital wireless environment, however, it is desirable to have the various additional benefits provided in the compact systems to also be provided within this less compact configuration. These benefits include the simplified exchange of control signals between the transceiver system and the modem system, the close placement of the RF signal processing circuitry to the antenna within the transceiver system, and the ability to operate under varying environmental conditions.   Therefore, it is desirable to provide a transceiver<br><br>
[QCPA194PA]<br>
system that can provide these benefits while also allowing for optimal placement of the antenna. Additionally, since the concentrated subscriber system utilizes the digital modems from a standard mobile subscriber unit in the preferred embodiment to reduce cost, but can be located at a greater range of distances from the base station during use, it is also desirable to have that transceiver system adjust the strength of the Rx signal to the range of decibel levels in which the modems were originally designed to operate, so that processing of the signals by the modems may proceed properly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Based on the forgoing, a transceiver system for a wireless telephone concentrated subscriber system that allows an antenna to be placed in a location having optimal reception and that can interface with existing or minimally modified digital modems is described. The transceiver system includes an antenna, an antenna interface system and modem interface system separated by a coaxial cable. The antenna is placed in a location having optimal reception such as the roof of a building and in close proximity to the antenna interface system. The coaxial cable couples the antenna interface system to the modem interface system which is placed within the building so that it may be easily accessed for service and configuration, and so that it may be coupled to the rest of the concentrated subscriber system.<br>
In order to allow modems designed for use in existing mobile subscriber units to be used to demodulate the RF signal received by the antenna, the modem interface system includes a two state variable attenuator and an attenuation register that are configured to either reduce the strength of the incoming signal when the concentrated subscriber system is located near a base station, or to pass the incoming signal without attenuation when the concentrated subscriber unit is at a more distant location. Once the concentrated subscriber system is put in place a signal loss detection system fixes the amount of signal loss experienced by the "receive" (Rx) signal before being supplied to the modems and the transmit (Tx) signal before being provided to the antenna as the environmental conditions change. The signal loss detection systems includes a detector located in the modem interface system that receives an oscillating signal transmitted from the antenna interface system through the coaxial cable and an attenuator controlled by the detector. A differential integrator within the signal loss detection system determines the difference between oscillating signal and a<br><br>
reference value accordingly so the loss experienced by the Rx and Tx signals remains constant or is "normalized."<br>
Additionally, DC power is transmitted from the modem interface system to the antenna interface system through the coaxial cable so that the antenna interface system may be easily installed and positioned with consideration only to optimal reception and not the availability of power. The antenna interface system allows multiple modems to generate a signal using a single power amplifier circuit by including a maximum power limiting system that detects when the signal being generated exceeds the capacity of the transmit power amplifier, and that transmits an alarm signal to the modem interface system in response so that the modem interface system can signal the rest of the concentrated subscriber system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
A method and apparatus for providing radio frequency interface to a concentrated subscriber system is described. In the following description the invention is described within the context of a code division multiple access digital cellular telephone system. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the invention may be practiced within a variety of radio based wireless telecommunication systems using digital or .analog modulation using single or multiple base stations, or satellite based gateways. Also, while a coaxial<br><br>
cable is used in the following description, the use of other wire based transmission media will be apparent. In various other instances variable attenuation of certain signals is performed in order to achieve desired decibel level. It will be understood that variable amplification of these signals may be used to provide similar results. Also in the following description, various well known systems and interfaces are provided in block form. This is done in order to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the disclosure of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a cellular telephone system configured in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Base transceiver station 102 transmits and receives radio frequency (RF) signals to and from remote communication units 100 and 112. In the preferred embodiment these RF signals are modulated in accordance with the CDMA spread spectrum techniques described in US Patent Number 4,901,307 ('307 ) entitled "Spread Spectrum Multiple Access Communication System Using a Satellite or Terrestrial Repeater", and US Patent Number 5,103,459 ('459] entitled "System and Method for Generating Signal Wave forms in a CDMA Cellular Telephone System" assigned to QUALCOMM™ Incorporated as well as in specification IS-95 from the Telecommunication Industry Association (2001 Pennsylvania Avenue, Suite 800, Washington, DC 20006; entitled "Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" (IS-95). Additionally, base transceiver station 102 interfaces with base station controller (BSC) 104 ir any one of a variety of manners including microwave link, ground basec wire connections, fiber optic cable, or a combination thereof. BSC 104 interfaces with public telephone switching network (PSTN) 106 through mobile switching center (MSC) 105 allowing various communicatioion sessions or telephone calls to be delivered between base transceiver statioion 102, base transceiver station 110, and other base transceiver stations 108.<br>
Base transceiver station 110 interfaces with BSC 104 in a simila manner as base transceiver station 102 and communicates with remot communication unit 112 and concentrated subscriber system (CSS) 113 vi; RF signals modulated in accordance with above referenced patent '459 an
 <br>
microphone and speaker. While CSS controller 114 is shown coupled directly to subscriber units 116, alternative methods for exchanging information are contemplated including a simplified form of radio wave based communication. Additionally, alternative numbers of subscriber units 116 may be coupled to CSS controller 114 other than the fifty units indicated.<br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of CSS controller 114 of Fig. 1 configured in accordance with the described embodiment of the invention. Antenna interface system 270 transmits and receives spread spectrum modulated RF signals to and from base transceiver station 110 of Fig. 1 through antenna 250. The received signals are supplied through coaxial cable 251 and modem interface system 252 to modem bank 260 which is comprised of modems 262(1) through (16). The transmitted signals are generated by modem bank 260 and transmitted through modem interface system 252 and coaxial cable 251 to antenna interface system 270 which supplies the signals to antenna 250. Multiplexer system 266 couples subscriber lines 256(1) through (50) to modems 262(1) through (16) of modem bank 260. Control system 254 receives and provides information to modem bank 260 and controls multiplexer system 266 using information stored in memory sub-system 253. The operation and configuration of control system 254 as well as modems 262 and multiplexer system 266 is described in the above referenced copending application "Concentrated Subscriber System for Wireless Local Loop." While sixteen modems are shown the use of different numbers of modems is consistent with the operation of the invention.<br>
Fig. 3 is a block diagram of antenna interface system 270 when configured in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. Duplexer 302 is coupled to the input of low noise amplifier 304 and the output of coupler 305 as well as to antenna 250. Duplexer 312 is coupled to the output of low noise amplifier 304 and the input of variable attenuator 313 as well as to coaxial cable 251. Transmit power amplifier 306 is placed between coupler<br>
305	and variable antenuator 313. Detector 307 is coupled via coupler 305 to<br>
the output of transmit power amplifier 306 and to the input of differential<br>
integrator 309 which has a reference voltage applied to the other input. The<br>
output of differential integrator 309 is applied to the control input of<br>
variable antenuator 313 and to low frequency oscillator 316. Inductor 322<br>
connects low frequency oscillator 316 and power distribution system 300 to<br>
coaxial cable 251. High frequency oscillator 325 is couple4 to coaxial cable 251<br>
through capacitor 321, resistor 329 and lowpass filter 330.    Power amplifier<br>
»* -<br>
306	and low noise amplifier 304 may be formed by a series of amplifier and<br><br>
filter circuits placed in various locations within the signal path but are shown as a single system for ease of drawing.<br>
During operation a receive (Rx) signal received by antenna 250 is passed to duplexer 302 which directs the carrier signal to low noise amplifier 304. Low noise amplifier 304 amplifies the relatively weak Rx carrier signal to a decibel level range greater than the decibel level range properly demodulated by one of modems 262 by an amount that is at least as much as the maximum expected signal loss introduced by co-axial cable 251 and any other intermediate circuitry. The amplified Rx carrier signal is then transmitted through duplexer 312 and coaxial cable 251 to modem interface system 252 (Fig. 2). Outgoing or transmit (Tx) signals transmitted from modem interface system 252 through coaxial cable 251 are directed by duplexer 312 to variable attenuator 313 which passes the signal to power amplifier 306. The resulting amplified signal generated at the output of power amplifier 306 is passed through coupler 305 and duplexer 302 to antenna 250 from which it is transmitted to base transceiver station 110 of Fig. 1.<br>
Detector 307 receives a signal from coupler 305 that is substantially proportional to the Tx carrier signal at the output of power amplifier 306 and asserts a proportional DC voltage that is applied to differential integrator 309. While the use of a proportional relationship between the signals at the input and output of detector 307 is preferred, other relationships that are indicative of the power being generated by power amplifier 306 may also be used and will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Differential integrator 309 generates another DC voltage signal based on the difference between the DC voltage from detector 307 and the reference voltage. If the voltage from detector 307 is less than the reference voltage, the second DC voltage from differential integrator 309 is placed at a first level which in the preferred embodiment is eleven volts, although any other voltage level may be easily substituted. Once the DC voltage from detector 307 exceeds the reference voltage the DC voltage from differential integrator 309 begins to decrease in proportion to the difference between the DC voltage from detector 307 and the reference voltage. Once again the use of a proportional relationship between the inputs and the output the system, in this case differential integrator 309, is preferred, but not necessary as other relationships between the inputs and outputs of differential integrator 309 that provide similar results will be apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
Variable attenuator 313 responds to this decrease in the voltage asserted by differential integrator 309 by introducing attenuation into the<br><br>
transmit signal received from duplexer 312, This attenuation is increased in proportion to the amount the voltage asserted by differential integrator 309 decreases. Additionally, when the DC voltage from differential integrator 309 begins to decrease below eleven volts, low frequency oscillator 316 begins to generate a low frequency signal that is transmitted through inductor 322 and coaxial cable 251 to modem interface system 252. This low frequency signal forms a power alarm signal that is used by modem interface system 252 and control system 254 to perform further power control functions. Various alternative methods of performing this feedback loop other than using a decrease in the DC voltage from differential integrator 309 to cause an increase in the amount of attenuation introduced by variable attenuator 313 will be apparent to one skilled in the art. Thus, the power of the output signal from power amplifier 306 is held at a predetermined maximum and therefore power amplifier 306 is prevented from generating an output power level beyond this predetermined maximum.<br>
High frequency oscillator 325 constantly generates a signal loss detection signal that has a frequency close to the frequencies of the Rx and Tx signal over which the various telephone calls and other communication sessions are carried. In the preferred embodiment, this frequency should be sufficiently close to the Rx and Tx signals that the frequency loss detection signal experiences a signal loss that is similar to that experienced by the Rx and Tx signals when transmitted over coaxial cable 251. However, the use of signal loss detection signals having a frequency that are not close to the frequency of the Tx or Rx signals is also consistent with the operation of the invention. Additionally, the strength of this signal loss detection signal is tightly controlled so that the amount of loss it experiences from transmission through the coaxial cable can be measured. The signal loss detection signal is transmitted through lowpass filter 330, capacitor 321 and resistor 329 to coaxial cable 251 which passes the signal to modem interface system 252. Power distribution system 300 receives a DC voltage from modem interface system 252 over coaxial cable 251 and distributes the power to the various other systems that make up antenna interface system 270 through connections that are not shown for ease of drawing.<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram of modem interface system 252 when configured in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. The amplified Rx signal from antenna interface system 270 of Fig. 3 is passed by coaxial cable 251 to variable antenuator 350 through capacitor 352. The signal from attenuator 350 then passes through coupler 355, attenuator 354, duplexer 356, to low noise amplifier 358.  Low noise amplifier 358 amplifies<br><br>
the signal and supplies it to splitter 360 which splits it into four signals that are provided to four modem systems (not shown), each of which has four modems that make up the sixteen modems of modem bank 260. Tx signals from the four modem systems that make up modem bank 260 of Fig. 2 are combined by summer 362 and passed through power amplifier 364, which amplifies them, duplexer 356, variable attenuator 354, coupler 355, and antenuator 350. The resulting Tx signal is then passed through capacitor 352 and coaxial cable 251 to antenna interface system 270. Power generation system 380 is coupled to coaxial cable 251 through inductor 382.<br>
Bandpass filter 366 receives a signal from coupler 355 that is proportional to the signal at the output of attenuator 350 and filters out most of the noise and signal not at the frequency of the signal generated by high frequency oscillator 325 of Fig. 3. This causes the signal from high frequency oscillator 325 to pass to detector 368 which generates a corresponding DC voltage that is applied to the input of differential integrator 370. Differential integrator 370 generates a DC voltage based on the difference between the voltage from detector 368 and the reference voltage applied to its other input that is applied to variable attenuator 350. The signal from differential integrator 370 causes variable attenuator 350 to reduce the strength of the carrier signal from antenna interface system 270 accordingly such that the loss introduced by coaxial cable 251 will be normalized and the signal can be placed within a decibel range that can easily and properly demodulated by one of the modems 262 of modem bank 260. The reference voltage is applied to differential integrator 370 such that the attenuation introduced by variable attenuator 350 is reduced as the signal loss introduced by coaxial cable 251 increases thereby fixing the amount of signal loss introduced into the signal as it travels between the antenna interface card and the modem interface card. In the preferred embodiment the amount of signal loss is set to the maximum amount of loss expected from coaxial cable 251 alone placed in the least optimal configuration and conditions. This allows the signal strength applied to the modems to remain constant despite varying lengths of coaxial cable 251 and varying operating environments and temperatures. Power generation system 380 provides DC through coaxial cable 251 and inductor 382 to antenna interface system 270.<br>
Bandpass filter 372 allows the low frequency signal generated by low frequency oscillator 316 of Fig. 3 to pass to detector 374 after being transmitted through inductor 377 and capacitor 378. When detector 374 receives this low frequency signal, it generates a power alarm signal that is applied to control system 254 of Fig. 2. UHF adjust register 376 is set to either<br><br>
activate or deactivate attenuator 354 depending on the distance concentrated subscriber system 113 of Fig. 1 is from base transceiver station 110 of Fig. 1. If the concentrated subscriber system is located in close proximity to the base transceiver station the register is set to activate attenuator 354 so that the strength of the signal received by duplexer 356 is reduced. If the CSS is located a significant distance away from bases station transceiver 110, UHF adjust register 376 is set to deactivate attenuator 354 so that the signal strength applied to duplexer 356 is not reduced. This provides the concentrated subscriber system with increased dynamic range for receiving and transmitting signals, and therefore increases the range of distances in which it can properly interact with base transceiver station 110. The transmit carrier signal from modem bank 260 of Fig. 2 and summer 362 of Fig. 4 is also transmitted through attenuators 354 and 350 which helps ensure that the difference between the decibel level of the receive and transmit carrier signals remains within a predetermined range which in the preferred embodiment is that proscribed by the IS-95 specification. However, it is also contemplated that the Tx carrier signal could bypass antenuator 354 if such a configuration was desirable.<br>
By providing a transceiver system that couples the antenna to a concentrated subscriber system through a coaxial cable as described above; a concentrated subscriber system can be implemented that has improved transmission and reception capability. This is because when such a transceiver system is incorporated into a concentrated subscriber system, the antenna can be placed in a remote location where the RF signals used for communication can be transmitted and received more easily while the subscriber units remain in close proximity to the subscribers. The ability to use the coaxial cable to connect the antenna to the concentrated subscriber system is made possible by the self regulating signal loss control capability provided via the use of an antenna interface system that generates a high frequency signal transmitted through the coaxial cable and a modem interface system that adjusts the amount of attenuation introduced into the carrier signal based on the loss experienced by that high frequency signal. This allows the signal loss to be normalized over a variety of cable lengths and configurations, and over a variety of environmental conditions including temperature, so that the decibel level of the signal applied to the modems will be within a desired range. The ability to place the antenna in an optimal location is further enhanced by the transmission of power from the modem interface system to the antenna interface system through the<br><br>
coaxial cable which eliminates the need to place the transceiver system in close proximity with a power source.<br>
Additionally, the use of the UHF adjust register within the modem interface system increases the range of distances from the base station within which the concentrated subscriber system can operate properly using prior art standard digital modems by allowing the modem interface system to be configured for additional signal attenuation. This allows prior art digital modem to be utilized within the concentrated subscriber system thereby reducing the cost of developing and implementing the concentrated subscriber system. The use of a power output detect circuit placed in the antenna interface system that signals the modem system with a low frequency signal transmitted through the coaxial cable provides power control and limiting functionality within the transceiver system. This power control and limiting functionality allows a concentrated subscriber system incorporating the described transceiver system to utilize CDMA digital cellular modems which must vary the power output significantly in order to conduct a phone call as described above. The use of CDMA digital cellular modems is desirable because of the improved bandwidth utilization and communication quality they provide.<br>
Thus a transceiver system for interfacing with digital cellular modems is described. Various alternative embodiments of the invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art. The exemplary embodiment provided above is merely for purposes of illustration and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
