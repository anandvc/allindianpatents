				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an analysis system, in<br>
particular for medical analysis work for carrying out<br>
clinico-chemical and immunological analyses.<br>
Wet-chemical analysis systems, in which liquid reagents<br>
are provided in reagent containers which are held in<br>
suitable holders of a rotatable reagent rotor, are<br>
known. Furthermore, these known wet-chemical analysis<br>
systems have a sample rotor into which the samples<br>
contained in corresponding sample tubes are inserted.<br>
The reagent rotor is assigned a reagent pipettor, and<br>
the sample rotor is assigned a sample pipettor. A third<br>
rotor, a reaction rotor, is fitted with reaction<br>
cuvettes.<br>
These known wet-chemical analysis systems operate as<br>
follows: the reagent pipettor is used to remove a<br>
predetermined amount of an analysis-specific reagent<br>
from the reagent containers contained in the reagent<br>
rotor and introduce this into a reaction cuvette,<br>
whereupon the sample pipettor removes a specified<br>
amount from a predetermined sample and introduces it<br>
into the reaction cuvette which has been filled with<br>
the reagent. The reaction cuvette, which in this way<br>
has been fed with a reagent and a sample, is moved from<br>
the reaction rotor to a measurement position, where,<br>
for example, a photometric measurement of the reaction<br>
solution is carried out, which is then evaluated on the<br>
basis of stored comparison values.<br>
Wet-chemical analysis systems of this nature are<br>
suitable in particular for extensive series of tests or<br>
for a high incidence of analysis, as arises, for<br>
example, in clinical laboratories. Since the wet-<br>
chemical reagents contained in the open reagent vessels<br>
in the reagent plate have only a limited shelf life, a<br>
wet-chemical analysis system of this nature can only be<br>
operated if a certain minimum number of examinations<br>
are carried out in the system, since otherwise<br>
excessively frequent exchanging of reagents which have<br>
not been used but have expired is required, and this<br>
increases the operating costs.<br>
As an alternative, a dry-chemical analysis system, in<br>
which reaqentsare applied to a carrier material in the <br>
solid state, is known. These reagent carriers are<br>
wetted with a predetermined amount of the sample, and<br>
the reagent carrier to which the sample has been<br>
applied is then examined in a detector device, for<br>
example by means of photometric measurement. However,<br>
these dry-chemical analysis systems have the drawback<br>
that the development costs for the reagent carriers are<br>
very high and that the samples generally have to be<br>
applied manually to the reagent carrier, so that these<br>
analysis systems are only suitable for single<br>
measurements or measurements with small numbers of<br>
samples or tests.<br>
DE 33 18 573 A1 has disclosed an analysis appliance in<br>
which two concentrically rotatable rotors, i.e. an<br>
inner rotor for sample cuvettes and an outer rotor for<br>
measuring cuvettes, are provided, which rotors can be<br>
rotated independently of one another. Furthermore, in<br>
this appliance there is a pivotable working arm which,<br>
at its free end, is provided with a pipette. The pivot<br>
path of the pipette intersects the two rotors, so that<br>
in each case one measuring cuvette of the outer rotor<br>
and one samgle cuvette of the inner rotor lie in the<br>
pivot path of the pipette Furthermore, a measuring<br>
station, reagent bottles and a device for drying the<br>
pipette, as well as, if appropriate, a cleaning station<br>
for the pipette are provided on the pivot path of the<br>
pipette, outside the outer rotor.<br>
This known device operates as follows:<br>
The arm with the pipetting device is pivoted over a<br>
sample cuvette located in the inner rotor, the pipette<br>
tip is immersed in the sample, and the sample is drawn<br>
into the pipette. The arm then pivots from the inner<br>
rotor to the outer rotor, above a measuring cuvette,<br>
and releases the sample into the measuring cuvette.<br>
Then, the measuring cuvette is taken hold of by a<br>
gripper situated on the arm, is lifted together with.<br>
the arm, removed from the rotor and pivoted over the<br>
stationary measuring station, whereupon the measuring<br>
cuvette is lowered into the measuring station and<br>
released by the gripper. After this, the arm executes<br>
one or more further sequences of movements and, if<br>
1 appropriate after the pipette has first been cleaned,<br>
picks up one reagent or a plurality of reagents from<br>
the stationary reagent bottles, which are then injected<br>
into . the measuring cuvette located in the measuring<br>
station. After the measurement has taken place, the<br>
measuring cuvette is returned to its position in the<br>
outer rotor by the arm.<br>
A drawback of this known device is that the measuring<br>
cuvettes have to be transported out of and back to the<br>
rotor by the arm, making it necessary to provide the<br>
arm with a gripper, and consequently the arm structure<br>
becomes complex. Furthermore, transporting the<br>
measuring cuvette from the outer rotor to the measuring<br>
station by means of the arm requires a certain time,<br>
during which the analysis appliance is not available<br>
for its actual task, i.e. for analysis.<br>
DE 41 28 698 Al has disclosed an analysis system in<br>
which sample vessels, reagent vessels and reaction<br>
vessels are arranged on a common rotor. This analysis<br>
system is equipped with a lifting grp ettpr which is<br>
arranged above the rotor edge and is able, by being<br>
lowered and raised, to pipette samples and reagent to<br>
and fro between different positions on the rotor, which<br>
rotates for this purpose. A photometric measuring<br>
station, which is able to carry out measurements on a<br>
fluid contained inside a reaction vessel in the rotor,<br>
is provided radially outside the rotor. The reagent<br>
vessels on the rotor of this known analysis system are<br>
formed by storage containers which are provided with<br>
dispensing openings, which the pipette tip of the<br>
pipetting arm can enter. Owing to the arrangement of<br>
the reagents on the rotor, and in particular within<br>
relatively large storage containers on the rotor, the<br>
number of reagents which can be used and/or the number <br>
of samples which can be analysed is limited by the<br>
space available on the rotor, so that an analysis<br>
system of this nature can be used primarily for<br>
standardized, recurring tests which always use the same<br>
reagents.<br>
EP 0,223 ,002 A2 has disclosed an automatic analysis<br>
system in which reagent carriers which are each<br>
provided with a plurality of holders are used. One of<br>
these holders serves as a measuring cuvette, one serves<br>
as a sample holder, and the other holders contain<br>
reagents. A plurality of reagent carriers are held next<br>
to one another in a magazine which can move in<br>
translation, it being possible to move the reagent-<br>
carrier holders of the magazine to in front of the<br>
entrance to a transfer station. The exit of the<br>
transfer station is directed towards spoke-like<br>
reagent-carrier holders of a rotary wheel. A system-<br>
reagent carrier which has been moved out of the<br>
magazine into the transfer station is processed in the<br>
transfer station, for which purpose pipetting and<br>
suction devices are connected to the transfer station.<br>
A sample which has been dealt with in the transfer<br>
station and is contained in an associated reagent<br>
carrier, after it has been dealt with in the transfer<br>
station, is transferred to the rotatable wheel, by<br>
which it is pivoted to in front of an optical analysis<br>
station, where the sample which is to be analysed,<br>
which is located in the radially outer holder, is<br>
analysed. The rotatable wheel of this known device therefore serves only as a means of<br>
transporting the reagent carriers.<br>
WO 93/02364 discloses an automated analytical instrument including two fluid<br>
dispensing units for dispensing the fluid to be tested. It does not have a reading device<br>
for reading machine-readable identification code (S) of the system reagent carrier.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an analysis system in which both the<br>
appliance costs and the costs of the individual tests are low compared to the prior art<br>
and which has an extensive test menu and a simple work-flow concept, so that variable<br>
single sample or mufti-sample profiles can be carried out inexpensively.<br>
The object is achieved by means of the analysis system as specified in claim 1, which<br>
comprises an analysis appliance and one or more system-reagent carrier (s) the<br>
analysis appliance having: at least one rotor which can be driven in controlled rotation,<br>
first holding devices for reagent vessels, second holding devices for sample vessels, a<br>
lifting/pivoting device which is provided with a pipetting device, can be driven in a<br>
controlled manner and can move towards and away from the rotor along a pivot path, a<br>
washing station for the pipetting device, a detector device and a control device for<br>
controlling the drive of the rotor and the drive of the lifting/pivoting device, and for<br>
controlling the operation of the pipetting device and the detector device it being<br>
possible to place at least one sample vessel on the pivot path of the pipetting device,<br>
and the first holding devices being provided in the rotor, which forms a reaction rotor<br>
and being designed to hold measuring cuvettes, the detector device being situated in<br>
the area of a comer position of the reaction rotor, so that the analysis takes place in a<br>
measuring cuvette which is located in the rotor, and the system-reagent carrier having<br>
at least one cuvette which is prefilled with a test-specific, preformulated, wet-chemical<br>
system reagent, as well as the measuring cuvette.<br>
The analysis system as claimed in claim 1 with the analysis appliance according to<br>
claim 17 and the system reagent carrier according to claim 28 enable a<br>
comparison of the first identification code and the second identification code and<br>
decides whether the system reagent carrier is allowed for use in the analysis<br>
appliance or not. The general inventive concept of the present application is to<br>
process both identification codes in order to obtain a decision whether a system<br>
reagent carrier may be used in the analyzer.<br>
Preferably, the system-reagent carrier has a plurality of cuvettes which are arranged<br>
next to one another and are connected to one another, at least one of the cuvettes<br>
being prefiiied with a test-specific, preformulated, wet-chemical system<br>
reagent.<br>
Preferably, further cuvettes are arranged on two opposite sides of a central<br>
measuring cuvette, the opposite sides preferably being the radially inner and<br>
radially outer sides of the measuring cuvette which has been placed in a holding<br>
device, with reference to the radius of the reaction rotor. This design of a system-<br>
reagent carrier is advantageous in that the central measuring cuvette is used to<br>
hold the sample which is to be analysed, to which the reagents, which are held in<br>
the side cuvettes, are added by pipetting. The sample which is contained in the<br>
measuring cuvette and has been mixed wi th the reagents can then be analysed<br>
after the reaction rotor has been rotated to in front of the detector device.<br>
The combination of an analysis appliance which is of relatively simple and<br>
inexpensive structure and the system-reagent carrier, which has one or more<br>
cuvettes which are filled individually, and in a test-specific manner, with system<br>
reagents, each cuvette being designed to carry out a single analysis operation,<br>
forms the basis of the inexpensive, flexible analysis system which allows the work to<br>
be carried out economically and inexpensively even for small to medium numbers<br>
of samples.<br>
The cuvettes or the measuring cuvettes of each system reagent carrier may in this<br>
case all be prefiiied with the same reagent, resulting in a system-reagent carrier<br>
which is suitable for series testing of a multiplicity of different samples with regard<br>
to an analysis parameter. However, it. is also possible to provide system-reagent<br>
carriers in which the cuvettes or<br>
measuring cuvettes are prefilled with different<br>
reagents, in order to carry out analyses on a single<br>
sample with regard to a multiplicity of analysis<br>
 parameters.<br>
Advantageously, the detector device has a photometric<br>
detector. In this embodiment, it is possible to carry<br>
out photometric measurements on the reaction solution, <br>
comprising sample and reagent, which is contained in<br>
the measuring cuvette to be tested.<br>
Preferably, the second holding devices are formed by<br>
stationary holders which are arranged on a circular<br>
path which lies concentrically with respect to the<br>
pivot path of the lifting/pivoting device. This allows<br>
a very inexpensive design of the analysis appliance, in<br>
which only a sinsle rotatable rotor, i.e. the reaction<br>
rotor, has to be provided, while the second holding<br>
devices are provided in a stationary position in the<br>
analysis appliance.<br>
In an advantageous refinement, the second holding<br>
devices are provided on a second rotor which can be<br>
driven in controlled rotation, is of annular design and<br>
is arranged concentrically with respect to the reaction<br>
rotor. This configuration produces an analysis<br>
appliance with a higher throughput capacity, and allows<br>
the individual analyses to be carried out more<br>
flexibly.<br>
Preferably, the second holding devices and the control<br>
device are designed in such a way that reagent<br>
containers can be inserted into the second holding<br>
devices. For certain cases, it is not only the<br>
mechanical insertion of the reagent containers into the<br>
second holding devices, but also the ability of the<br>
control unit to recognize a reagent container which has<br>
been inserted and to include this in the test process<br>
sequence, which make it possible to use specially<br>
prepared reagents which have been added to a reagent<br>
container or to use larger stores of a reagent, which<br>
is then provided in the reagent container, if the same<br>
reagent can be used, for example, for a plurality of<br>
tests.<br>
Furthermore, it is particularly advantageous if reagent<br>
containers are provided, which are essentially<br>
compatible with the sample vessels, so that they can<br>
likewise be held by the second holding devices. This<br>
makes it possible to realize reagent containers with<br>
reagents which have been specially prepared for one<br>
analysis or various analyses (universal reagent) and<br>
which are not, or cannot be, produced at the level of<br>
system-reagent carriers. It is also possible for<br>
reagent containers of this nature to contain, for<br>
example, a dry-chemical reagent, should this be<br>
necessary for special analyses. The dry-chemical<br>
reagent should be dissolved manually or automatically<br>
prior to use. If a reagent container of this nature is<br>
inserted into one of the second holding devices<br>
together with sample vessels which are contained in<br>
other holding devices, it is preferable to provide an<br>
empty measuring cuvette in the first holding device for<br>
system-reagent carriers, for analysis purposes.<br>
Preferably, a washing device for cleaning measuring<br>
cuvettes is provided. This washing device is<br>
advantageous in particular if the analysis uses empty<br>
measuring cuvettes into which both the sample and an<br>
externally supplied reagent are introduced, in which<br>
case the washed measuring cuvette can be used a number<br>
of times.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment, the analysis<br>
appliance has a bound/free separation station. In this<br>
station, detectable substances which are not bound to<br>
the solid phase are separated off from the reagent,<br>
which is necessary when carrying out heterogeneous<br>
immunological tests, in which case a suitable specific<br>
solid phase is provided in the reagent, to which solid<br>
phase detectable substances are bound as a function of<br>
the analyte and in interaction with further reagent<br>
constituents.<br>
In this case, it is particularly advantageous if the<br>
detector device has a photomultiplier for chemi-.<br>
luminescence measurement. This photomultiplier for<br>
chemiluminescence measurement may be provided in<br>
addition or as an alternative to a photometric<br>
detector, depending on the type of measurement or<br>
analyses for. which the analysis system is to be<br>
designed.<br>
Preferably, an evaluation unit, which evaluates the<br>
data recorded by the detector device using reference<br>
data which are stored in a memory device, is provided<br>
in the analysis system. However, the evaluation unit<br>
may also be formed by an external, commercially<br>
available computer, which is provided with suitable<br>
data and programs for evaluation and is connected to<br>
the analysis appliance of the analysis system via an<br>
interface.,<br>
If the analysis system is provided with an evaluation<br>
unit, a display device for displaying the results<br>
supplied by the evaluation device is preferably<br>
provided.<br>
It is also possible to provide a printer device for<br>
printing out the results supplied by the evaluation<br>
device.<br>
In a preferred configuration, the cuvettes are each<br>
closed off by means of a pierceable membrane. This<br>
ensures that the cuvettes are hermetically sealed until<br>
the analysis begins, with the result that the shelf<br>
life of the reagents contained in the cuvettes is<br>
increased noticeably, and therefore the storability of<br>
the system-reagent carriers is improved. Furthermore,<br>
it becomes possible to assess the condition of the<br>
reagent prior to measurement, making a subsequent<br>
diagnostic assessment even more certain.<br>
The cuvettes or the system-reagent carrier may be<br>
provided with a machine-readable identification code<br>
for the respective reagent contained therein, and the<br>
analysis appliance may have a device for reading this<br>
identification code. This results in a higher level of<br>
automation when carrying out analyses, since each<br>
measuring cuvette which is to be filled with the<br>
sample, or the system-reagent carrier of this cuvette,<br>
is automatically detected, and the control device of<br>
the analysis appliance, as well as the evaluation<br>
device, are able to further process the data obtained<br>
from the reading device concerning the nature of the<br>
reagent contained in the corresponding measuring<br>
cuvette or in the corresponding system-reagent carrier<br>
and therefore . concerning the test which is to be<br>
carried out with this reagent.<br>
It is also particularly advantageous if the system-<br>
reagent carrier or the measuring cuvettes are in each<br>
case provided with a manufacturer identification coding<br>
or a manufacturer identification code, and if a<br>
recognition and decoding device is provided for this<br>
coding or code, the reading device advantageously being<br>
designed so that it can also read the manufacturer<br>
identification coding. In this way, it is possible to<br>
prevent system-reagent carriers or measuring cuvettes<br>
which are unsuitable for this analysis system from<br>
being used, since under certain circumstances this<br>
could lead to incorrect analysis results, and<br>
consequently the reliability of the analysis is<br>
increased further. Suitable coding may, for example, be<br>
effected mechanically (key-lock principle),<br>
electrically, electronically or optically, in which<br>
case the coding may also comprise an element which is<br>
protected in a different way, such as for example a<br>
trade mark or a protected design element.<br>
If the measuring cuvettes of a system-reagent carrier<br>
or individual system-reagent carriers are in each case<br>
connected to one another by means of desired breaking<br>
points, it is possible, when required, to separate<br>
individual or a plurality of measuring cuvettes from<br>
the system-reagent carrier or to separate system-<br>
reagent carriers from one another if, for example, only<br>
a few measuring cuvettes or system-reagent carriers are<br>
required for the tests which are to be performed.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to an analysis<br>
appliance, in particular for an analysis system<br>
according to the invention, having at least one rotor<br>
which can be driven in controlled rotation, first<br>
holding devices for reagent vessels, second holding<br>
devices for sample vessels, a lifting/pivoting device<br>
which is provided with a pipetting device, can be<br>
driven in a controlled manner and can move towards and<br>
away from the rotor along a pivot path, a washing<br>
station for the pipetting device, a detector device and<br>
a control device for controlling the drive of the rotor<br>
and the drive of the lifting/pivoting device and for<br>
controlling the operation of the pipetting device and<br>
the detector device, it being possible to place at<br>
least one sample vessel on the pivot path of the<br>
pipetting device, and the rotor being designed to hold<br>
at least one measuring cuvette, in which analysis<br>
appliance the first holding devices are provided in the<br>
rotor, which forms a reaction rotor, and are designed<br>
to hold measuring cuvettes, and the detector device is<br>
situated in the area of a corner position of the<br>
reaction rotor, so that the analysis takes place in a<br>
measuring cuvette located in the rotor.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the analysis appliance,<br>
which correspond to the appliance-specific advantageous<br>
refinements of the analysis system, are given in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a system-reagent<br>
carrier,, in particular for an analysis system according<br>
to the invention, having at least one cuvette which is<br>
prefilled. with a test-specific, preformulated, wet-<br>
chemical system reagent, the cuvette being provided<br>
with a machine-readable identification code for the<br>
reagent contained in the particular cuvette, and the<br>
analysis appliance having a device for reading the<br>
identification code, in which system-reagent carrier<br>
the cuvette or the system-reagent carrier is provided<br>
with a manufacturer identification coding which can be<br>
read and evaluated by a reading device of an associated<br>
analysis appliance.<br>
An alternative system-reagent carrier is distinguished<br>
by the fact that a plurality of cuvettes, which are<br>
arranged next to one another and are connected to one<br>
another, are provided, at least one of the cuvettes<br>
being prefilled with a test-specific, preformulated,<br>
wet-chemical system reagent.<br>
Preferably, a system-reagent carrier according to the<br>
invention is designed in such a way that a central<br>
cuvette, which is designed as a measuring cuvette, is<br>
provided, and that at least one further cuvette is<br>
provided in the system-reagent carrier at least on one<br>
side of the central cuvette, next to the top opening<br>
thereof, which further cuvette forms a holding chamber<br>
for a system reagent, the central cuvette and the<br>
further cuvette(s) forming a cuvette arrangement.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the system-reagent carrier,<br>
which correspond to the refinements of the analysis<br>
system which are specific to the system-reagent<br>
carrier, are given in the subclaims.<br>
The invention will now be explained in more detail on<br>
the basis of an example and with reference to the<br>

Fig. 6 shows a perspective view of an alternative<br>
system-reagent carrier.<br>
The analysis system which is shown in Fig. 1 and is<br>
used for medical analysis work comprises an analysis<br>
appliance 1 with a housing 10 and at least one system-<br>
reagent carrier 2.<br>
The principal components of the analysis appliance 1<br>
are a reaction rotor 12, a holding part 14 with second<br>
holding devices 3 8 for sample vessels 40 a<br>
lifting/pivoting device 18 which is provided with a<br>
pipetting device (16) a washing station 43 for the<br>
pipetting device 16 a detector device 20 and a control<br>
device 22 (Fig. 2).<br>
The reaction rotor 12 comprises a rotating holding part 24 which, in the<br>
embodiment shown in Figs. 1 and 2, is designed as a rotatable disc, but may also<br>
be designed as a rotatable ring. The rotation plane in which the rotating holding<br>
part 24 rotates is horizontally oriented.<br>
The rotating holding part is driven in controlled rotation by means of a drive 26, the<br>
drive 26 having a stepper motor 28 which advances the rotating holding part 24 by<br>
a predeterminable angle of rotation at each rotation step. Via a motor shaft 30, the<br>
stepper motor 28 is connected to the centre of the rotating holding part 24. The<br>
motor shaft 30 can rotate about an axis 25" which runs vertically through the centre<br>
25. As an alternative to the stepper motor 28, it is also possible to provide any<br>
other kind of drive which is provided with a control unit which allows accurate<br>
angular orientation of the rotating holding part<br>
in the case which is not shown in the figures, in which the rotating holding part is<br>
designed as a ring, the motor shaft may be provided with a pinion which meshes<br>
with a gear wheel on the external or internal circumference of the annular<br>
rotating holding part or of an annular gearwheel which is connected to the holding<br>
part.<br>
The rotating holding part 24 is provided with first holding devices 32 for one or<br>
more system-reagent carriers 2, the first holding devices 32 lying on a circular path<br>
34 which is concentric with respect to the rotating holding part 24, and the first<br>
holding devices 32 lie close to the circumference of the rotating holding part 24.<br>
The carriers 2 are inserted into the first holding devices 32 which can be formed by<br>
recessed in the holding part 24. On its top side, the housing 10 of the analysis<br>
appliance 1 is also provided with the holding part 14 for the sample vessels 40,<br>
which is likewise <br>
horizontally oriented. In the embodiment shown in Figs. I and 2, the contour of the<br>
holding part 14 is substantially in the form of a sector of a circle. As an alternative, the<br>
holding part 14 may also be designed in the form of a circle, of a ring or of a<br>
segment of a circle. The holding part 14 is arranged at a higher level than the rotating<br>
holding part 24. The holding part 14 is provided with the second holding devices 38,<br>
which are arranged on a circular, path 36, having the centre 15, which is concentric<br>
with respect to the holding part 14, which is in the form of a sector of a circle. Sample<br>
vessels 40 are inserted in the second holding device 38. The centre 15 is at a<br>
distance from the centre 25 of the rotating holding part 24, the distance between<br>
these two centres or middle points 15 and 25 being less than or equal to the sum of<br>
the radius of the circular path 34 and the radius of the circular path 36, so that the<br>
circular paths 34 and 36 intersect one another.<br>
In the area of an intersection between the two circular paths 34 and 36, the holding<br>
part 14 is provided with a radially inwardly directed cutout 42 on the circumference<br>
which, in the plan view shown in Fig I, allows vertical access to the measuring cuvette<br>
44, to access which is located at the position of this intersection of the circular paths<br>
34 and 36, of the system-reagent carrier 2 which is held in the rotating holding part<br>
24 or to further cuvettes of this system-reagent carrier 2.<br>
The pipette-washing station 43, by means of which the pipetting device 16, and in<br>
particular the pipette tubes 16, can be rinsed, so that they are cleaned and ready for<br>
a further analysis operation, is provided at the location of a holding device 38" which<br>
is adjacent to the cutout 42 in the holding part 14. The pipette washing station 43<br>
may, for example," comprise a washing vessel 43" which can be filled or emptied with<br>
a washing liquid via an inlet and outlet (not shown).<br>
In the centre 15 of the circular path 36, the<br>
lifting/pivoting device 18 is mounted in such a way<br>
that it can pivot about the pin 15 and can be moved<br>
vertically along the vertical axis 15" located in the<br>
centre 15.<br>
The lifting/pivoting device 18 comprises a<br>
lifting/pivoting drive 46, which has a motor 48 which<br>
is preferably designed as a stepper motor, in order to<br>
pivot the lifting/pivoting device 18 about the axis<br>
15", preferably in equidistant steps, each step<br>
corresponding to an angle b which corresponds to the<br>
arc distance between two adjacent second holding<br>
devices 38.<br>
The lifting/pivoting device 46 furthermore has a<br>
piston/cylinder unit 50, which allows the<br>
lifting/pivoting device 18 to move vertically. In Fig. 2,<br>
by way of example, the cylinder 52 is driven to make<br>
the pivoting movement by a motor shaft of the motor 48.<br>
The piston 54, which projects upwards out of the<br>
housing 10 and passes through the centre 15 of the<br>
holding part 14, is thus made to pivot by the motor 48<br>
and is driven vertically by the piston 52.<br>
At its upper, free end, the piston 54 is provided with<br>
an arm 56 which extends substantially horizontally and<br>
away from the axis 15" substantially in the radially<br>
outward direction. The arm 56 extends in the radial<br>
direction to approximately as far as the circular path<br>
36, or slightly beyond this path. At the point where<br>
the arm 56 intersects the circular path 36 (as seen in<br>
the plan view shown in Fig. 1) , there is a pipette<br>
 holder 58 which extends downwards from the arm 56,<br>
towards the surface of the holding part 14, and a<br>
pipette tube 60, which is preferably exchangeable, is<br>
fitted at the bottom free end of this pipette holder.<br>
At its bottom, free end, the pipette tube 60 is<br>
narrowed so as to form a tip 62. The pipetting device<br>
16 is provided with a suction device (not shown) , <br>
which, inside the pipette tube 60, is able to generate<br>
a subatmospheric pressure or a superatmospheric<br>
pressure in order to suck in or eject fluid into or out","<br>
of the pipette tube 60.<br>
Fig. 1 also diagrammatically depicts a washing device<br>
72 for the measuring cuvettes 44, 44"44 by means<br>
of which device used measuring cuvettes can be emptied<br>
and rinsed when required. To this end, the washing<br>
device 72 has a vertically displaceable washing tube<br>
74, which is designed in a similar way to the pipetting<br>
tube 60 and is provided with a bottom tip in order to<br>
pierce the membrane 47 The washing device 72 can be<br><br>
used in particular to clean empty measuring cuvettes 44<br>
which are used to carry out analyses with reagents<br>
which are removed from an External reagent container<br>
41.<br>
The analysis appliance 1 shown in Fig. 1 also has a<br>
bound/free separation station 76, which is only<br>
diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 1. The bound/free<br>
separation station may be designed in a similar way to<br>
the washing device 72 and may likewise be provided with<br>
a vertically displaceable tube (not shown), which<br>
introduces a special washing solution into a measuring<br>
cuvette and removes the solution therefrom in order to<br>
carry out a bound/free separation process. In a<br>
bound/free separation process, molecules of a substance<br>
contained in the solution to be analysed are bound to<br>
binding partners which are specific for this substance<br>
and are on particles or on the wall of the sample<br>
vessel (bound phase) and are separated from such<br>
molecules, which float around freely in the solution<br>
(free phase). A bound/free separation process therefore<br>
represents a washing process in which the washing<br>
solution is replaced sufficiently often for essentially<br>
only bound molecules to remain in the measuring<br>
cuvette.<br>
The analysis appliance 1 shown in Figs. 1 and 2 also<br>
has an evaluation device 23, which is diagrammatically<br>
depicted in Fig. 2 and evaluates the data recorded by<br>
the detector device 2 0 using reference data which are<br>
stored in a memory device _2&gt;3" , which is likewise only<br>
diagrammatically depicted in Fig. 2. The detector<br>
device 20, the evaluation device 23 and the memory<br>
device 23" are (to this) end connected to one another in<br>
order to exchange data, in a manner which is not shown.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 1, the analysis appliance is<br>
provided with a terminal 78, which has a control panel<br>
80 for operating the analysis appliance 1 and, in<br>
particular, for inputting data to the control device<br>
22. Furthermore, a display device 82, which is used to<br>
display the results supplied by the evaluation device<br>
23, is provided in the terminal 78. The results<br>
supplied by the evaluation device 23 may also be<br>
printed out via a printer device 84 which is likewise<br>
provided in the terminal 78.<br>
The analysis appliance 1 furthermore has a reading<br>
device 64, which is located in. the area of and outside<br>
the circumference of the reaction rotor 12. The reading<br>
device 64 may be designed as a plain text reader, as a<br>
pixel code reader and/or as a bar code reader, in a,<br>
known way, the sensor device 66iof the reading device<br>
64 being directed towards the reaction rotor 12. The<br>
reading direction of the sensor device 66 is directed<br>
substantially radially inward with respect to the<br>
reaction rotor 12, and the vertical position of the<br>
sensor device 66 is selected to be below or above the<br>
reaction rotor 12, in such a way that the sensor device<br>
66 is able to read corresponding markings 68, 70 on the<br>
system-reagent carriers 2 or on the individual cuvettes<br>
or measuring cuvettes 44, 44", 44"", as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 3. The markings may comprise, an identification<br>
code 68 for the respective reagent and/or a<br>
manufacturer identification code 70 for identifying the<br>
manufacturer of the system-reagent carrier 2, Fig. 3<br>
showing, purely by way of example, the identification<br>
code 68 for the particular reagent in plain text and<br>
the manufacturer identification code 70 as a bar code.<br>
The measuring cuvettes 44, 44", 44"", which are<br>
arranged next to one another in the shape of an are<br>
corresponding to the circular path 34, of a first<br>
variant of a system-reagent carrier 2 are connected to<br>
one another at their top end section, which is of<br>
substantially rectangular design, so as to form a<br>
desired breaking point 45, in such a way that the<br>
measuring cuvettes 44, 44", 44" can be separated from<br>
one another when required and can thus be split into<br>
individual cuvettes. This allows the user to remove<br>
only the number of measuring cuvettes required for the<br>
planned analysis from this system-reagent carrier 2.<br>
Fig. 3 furthermore shows that two of the measuring<br>
cuvettes of the system-reagent carrier 2 shown in that<br>
figure, i.e. the measuring cuvettes 44" and 44"", have<br>
been prefilled, in each case to a different level, with<br>
a reagent 45" or 45"", while the measuring cuvette 44<br>
is empty and is ready for analysis of samples by means<br>
of a reagent which is not provided in the system-<br>
reagent carrier 2, which reagent is contained in an<br>
external reagent container 41, the shape of which is<br>
substantially compatible with the sample vessels 40, so<br>
that it can likewise be held by the second holding<br>
devices 38.<br>
In the case of the system-reagent carrier 2 which is<br>
shown in Fig. 3 and in which the respective reagents<br>
are provided in individual measuring cuvettes 44",<br>
44"", it is possible to validate the reagents before<br>
carrying out an analysis on the sample which is to be<br>
introduced into the empty measuring cuvette 44. During<br>
this validation of a reagent, the reagent is measured<br>
by the detector device 20, and the measured value is<br>
compared with a reference value, making it possible to<br>
assess the condition of the reagent before the sample<br>
is analysed.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a longitudinal section through a measuring<br>
cuvette 44" which has been prefilled with the reagent<br>
45" . Like all the other measuring cuvettes in the<br>
system-reagent carrier 2, the measuring cuvette 44" is<br>
hermetically sealed on its top side by means of a<br>
membrane 47. The membrane 47 comprises an elastically<br>
soft material which can be pierced by the tip 62 of the<br>
pipetting tube 60, and after the pipetting tube 60 has<br>
been withdrawn again, the pierced opening which is<br>
formed is substantially sealed again, to a sufficient<br>
extent for it to be impossible for any foreign bodies<br>
to penetrate into the interior of the measuring cuvette<br>
44" .<br>
Fig. 5 shows a second embodiment of the analysis system<br>
of the present invention, those components of the<br>
analysis system which correspond to those of the first<br>
embodiment being denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals.<br>
In the second embodiment, the reaction rotor 12 is<br>
designed in the same way and is provided with first<br>
holding devices 32 for system-reagent carriers 2, as<br>
has been described with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. The<br>
reaction rotor 12 is surrounded by an annular second<br>
rotor 86, which has holders 88 for the sample vessels<br>
4 0 and for the reagent containers 41, which are of<br>
compatible design. The annular second rotor 86 is<br>
arranged concentrically with respect to the reaction<br>
rotor 12, so that its centre of rotation likewise lies<br>
in the centre of rotation 25 of the reaction rotor 12.<br>
On its external circumference, the annular second rotor<br>
86 is provided with toothing 90 which engages with the<br>
toothing 92 of a drive pinion 94 of a drive unit (not<br>
shown) for the second rotor 86. The drive unit for the<br>
pinion 94, like the drive 26 of the reaction rotor 12,<br>
preferably has a stepper motor which advances the<br>
second rotor 86 by an angle g each time. The angle g in<br>
this case corresponds to the arc distance between two<br>
adjacent holders 88, the centre points of the holders.<br>
88 lying on a circular path 89 around a vertical axis<br>
running through the centre 25. In the embodiment shown<br>
in Fig. 5, the reaction rotor 12 and the second annular,<br>
rotor 86 lie in a single plane (the plane of the<br>
drawing in Fig. 5) ; however", they may also be offset in<br>
the vertical direction with respect to one another.<br>
In this embodiment, the lifting/pivoting pipettor 18 is<br>
mounted outside the circumference of the second annular<br>
rotor 86, in such a manner that it can pivot about an<br>
axis 15 The technical design of the lifting/pivoting<br>
pipettor 18 corresponds to that of the first exemplary<br>
embodiment. As in the first embodiment, the pipetting<br>
tube 60 of the lifting/pivoting pipettor 18, during<br>
pivoting, runs on a circular path 36,<br>
The circular path 36 intersects both the circular path<br>
89, on which the holders 88 of the annular second rotor<br>
86 lie, and the circular path 34, on which the first<br>
holding devices 32 for the system-reagent carriers 2<br>
are provided. The locations of the intersections<br>
between the circular path 36 and the circular paths 89<br>
and 34 each form stopping points for the stepper drive<br>
of the annular second rotor 86 or of the reaction rotor<br>
12, in such a manner that a sample vessel 40 or a<br>
reagent container 41, or a measuring cuvette 44, can<br>
come to rest at these intersection points when the<br>
respective drive comes to a standstill.<br>
The pipette-washing station 43, which is designed as<br>
described in the first embodiment, lies on the circular<br>
path 36, outside the circumference of the annular<br>
second rotor 86.<br>
The detector device 20, which is only diagrammatically<br>
depicted in Fig. 5, and the cuvette-washing station 72,<br>
which is likewise only diagrammatically depicted, are<br>
designed in a similar way to the first embodiment,<br>
their respective positions being adapted to the changed<br>
spatial details of the second embodiment, as can be<br>
seen from Fig. 5. The diagrammatically depicted reading<br>
device 64 is arranged outside the external<br>
circumference of the annular second rotor 86, and its<br>
sensor device 66 is directed radially inwards, so that<br>
the code information 68, 70 which is provided on the<br>
system-reagent carriers 2 can be read from outside the<br>
annular second rotor 86.<br>
Since, in the second embodiment, the lifting/pivoting<br>
device 18 has to cover significantly shorter pivot<br>
paths, i.e. generally only has to cover pivot paths<br>
between a position above the centre of a holder 8 8 on<br>
the annular second rotor 86 and the adjoining position<br>
above a measuring cuvette 44 of the system-reagent<br>
carrier 2 or the adjoining position above the pipette-<br>
washing station 43, it is possible for the individual<br>
analyses to proceed more flexibly than in the analysis<br>
system of the first embodiment.<br>
One method of operation of the analysis system<br>
according to the invention will now be explained in<br>
more detail with reference to Figs. 1 and 2. The<br>
lifting/pivoting device 18 moves out of its at-rest<br>
position, which is shown in solid lines, to a sample<br>
vessel 4 0 which contains the sample to be analysed, in<br>
that the lifting/pivoting device initially moves<br>
vertically upwards (arrow A) and is then pivoted<br>
anticlockwise, in the direction of arrow B, into the<br>
position 18" which is shown in dashed lines. Then, the<br>
lifting/pivoting device 18 is lowered in the direction<br>
of arrow C, the pipetting tube 60 entering sufficiently<br>
far into" the sample vessel 4 0 for the opening 61<br>
provided at the free end of the pipetting tube 60 to<br>
dip into the sample contained in the sample vessel 40.<br>
Then, by means of the suction device (not shown in the<br>
figures), of the pipetting device 16, a predetermined<br>
amount of sample is sucked into the pipetting device<br>
16, this suction operation being controlled by the<br>
control device 22 . <br>
After this, the lifting/pivoting pipettor 18 is raised<br>
again in the opposite direction to the arrow C and is<br>
pivoted back clockwise, in the opposite direction to<br>
the arrow B, until the pipetting tube 60 is located<br>
above the measuring cuvette 44, which lies at the<br>
intersection of the. circular paths 34 and 36, of the<br>
system-reagent carrier 2. Then, the lifting/pivoting <br>
pipettor 18 is lowered back in the direction of arrow<br>
C, the tip 62 of the pipetting tube 60 piercing the<br>
membrane 47 of the measuring cuvette 44, so that the<br>
opening 61 of the pipetting tube is situated inside the<br>
measuring cuvette 44. Then, the predetermined amount of<br>
sample which has been sucked in is ejected from the<br>
pipetting device 16 through the opening 61, into the<br>
measuring cuvette 44, so that the sample and the<br>
reagent located in the measuring cuvette 44 come into<br>
contact with one another.<br>
The lifting/pivoting pipettor 18 is then raised again<br>
in the direction of the arrow A and is pivoted to the<br>
pipette-washing station 43, where the pipetting device<br>
16 is cleaned as a result of the pipetting tube 60<br>
being lowered into the washing fluid situated in the<br>
pipette-washing station 43 and as a result of the<br>
washing fluid being sucked up and ejected a number<br>
times by means of the suction device. Then, the<br>
lifting/pipetting device 18 moves back into the at-rest<br>
position which is represented by solid lines.<br>
After the pipetting tube 60 has been removed from the<br>
measuring cuvette 44, the sample and the reagent<br>
situated in the measuring cuvette 44 are mixed with one<br>
another in a known way and then the reaction rotor 12<br>
rotates anticlockwise in the direction of the arrow D,<br>
until the measuring cuvette 44 has reached the detector<br>
device 20, where the photometric analysis of the<br>
mixture of reagent and sample contained in the<br>
measuring cuvette 44 takes place in a known way.<br>
The data recorded by the detector device 20 is then<br>
transmitted to the evaluation device 23, where it is<br>
evaluated in a manner known per se using calibration<br>
data stored in the memory device 23", whereupon the<br>
data recerded by the evaluation device 23 are<br>
transmitted to the display device 82 and/or the printer<br>
84.<br>
The information concerning the reagent contained in the<br>
measuring cuvette 44 is passed to the evaluation device<br>
23 by the reading device 64 which, when the measuring<br>
cuvette 44 moves past the reading device 64, reads the<br>
identification code which has been applied to the.<br>
measuring cuvette 44 and transmits it to the memory<br>
device 23". Since the angle of rotation between the<br>
reading device 64 and the location of analysis (the<br>
lower intersection of the two circular paths 36, 34 in<br>
Fig. 1) is known, a step counter, which adds or<br>
subtracts (depending on the direction of rotation) the<br>
movement steps of the reaction rotor 12, can be used to<br>
continuously record the precise position of each<br>
measuring cuvette which is held in the reaction rotor,<br>
so that in this way it is possible to accurately<br>
identify the measuring cuvette 44 which is located at<br>
the analysis site (in the detector device 20).<br>
In the case of analysis using bound/free separation, by<br>
way of example a finely dispersed magnetic particle<br>
solution as the solid phase, together with first<br>
antibodies, is used as the first reagent. A second<br>
reagent contains a label with a second antibody. A<br>
third reagent contains a substrate or a detection<br>
solution. Should it be necessary, it is also possible<br>
to provide a pretreatment solution as a further<br>
reagent. The abovementioned reagents are each contained<br>
in. a measuring cuvette of a system-reagent carrier 2.<br>
As an alternative., one of the cuvettes, instead of<br>
being prefilled with the first reagent (e.g. coated<br>
magnetic particles), may also be directly coated with a<br>
suitable binding partner. A universal reagent may also<br>
be . provided as the third reagent (substrate or<br>
detection solution). The detector (e.g. photomultiplier<br>
for chemiluminescence measurement) is to be selected as<br>
a function of the label used.<br>
The above-described method of operation of the analysis<br>
system according to the invention serves only to<br>
explain the theoretical principles of operation.<br>
Fundamentally, however, other methods of operation are<br>
also possible, such as for example pipetting from<br>
measuring cuvette to measuring cuvette, which is<br>
carried out, for example, in the case of a test which<br>
uses a plurality of reagents, the sample initially<br>
being pipetted into a first reagent, then mixed and<br>
subsequently subjected to photometric measurement, and<br>
then, for example, a second reagent from another<br>
measuring cuvette is pipetted into the first measuring<br>
cuvette containing the sample and the first reagent,<br>
and then these substances are mixed again and<br>
subsequently subjected to photometric measurement once<br>
again. Other methods of operation include, for example,<br>
pipetting a reagent from a reagent container which is<br>
situated in a holding device for sample vessels into an<br>
empty measuring cuvette, and then adding a sample by<br>
pipetting. It is also possible to provide a universal<br>
reagent which can be used for a large number of<br>
different tests.<br>
Fig. 6 shows an alternative configuration of a system-<br>
reagent carrier 102, which comprises a plurality of<br>
chambers or cuvettes 144, 144", 144"", 144""". In this<br>
case, there is a central cuvette 144 which is longer<br>
than the further cuvettes 144", 144"", 144""" and which<br>
projects downwards beyond these further cuvettes. The<br>
central cuvette 144 serves as the measuring cuvette and<br>
is designed to be held by a first holding device 32 of<br>
the reaction rotor 12. The further cuvettes 144" 144"",<br>
144""" are arranged on two opposite sides of the<br>
measuring cuvette 144, next to its opening.<br>
The individual cuvettes 144, 144", 144"", 144""" are<br>
connected to one another by means of a frame 104 which,<br>
at the same time, forms a top surface in which the<br>
openings of the cuvettes are formed. In plan view, the<br>
frame 104 is essentially in the shape of a trapezium,<br>
i.e. the two longitudinal sides 104", 104"" of the<br>
