				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a novel amine compound and an organic electroluminescence device (electroluminescence will be referred to as EL, hereinafter) using the amine compound and  more particularly, to an amine compound useful as a material constituting an organic EL device and an organic EL device which uses the amine compound and has a long life.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Organic EL devices are studied widely since the organic EL devices are completely shod devices and hghtly weight thin displays driven under a low voltage and planar light sources can be prepared by using such devices.<br>
In the application to displays, the organic EL devices have a drawback in that luminance of light emission decreases in a short time. To overcome the drawback, improvements in a hole transporting material have been attempted.<br>
For example, as disclosed in United States Patent No. 5,061,569, it is known that the half-life of emission can be improved by using an amine derivative having a condensed aromatic ring such as N,N"-di(naphthyl-l-yl)-N,N"-diphenyl-4,4"-benzidine (referred to as NPD, hereinafter) as the<br><br>
hole transporting material.<br>
However, since the above material has a glass transition temperature (Tg) as low as 100°C, an organic EL device using this material has a drawback in that the organic EL device has a short life time when the organic EL device is stored or used at a high temperature. In other words, the organic EL device has insufficient heat resistance. As another example, it is disclosed in the specification of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. Heisei 8(1996)-48656 that an aromatic diamine derivative having at least biphenyl group as a substituent is used as the hole transporting material.<br>
However, the above material has a drawback in that purification of the material is not easy since biphenyl group is too rigid and solubility of the diamine derivative having biphenyl group in organic solvents is poor. As the result, a material containing a great amount of impurities is obtained in industrial production of the aromatic diamine derivative and an organic EL device using the diamine derivative has insufficient heat resistance.<br>
Moreover, an organic EL device using the above amine derivative has insufficient properties other than the heat resistance such as insufficient luminance of light emission and life time of luminance.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made under the above circumstances and has an object of providing a novel amine compound which has excellent solubility in organic solvents and can be produced easily,  an organic EL device using the amine compound which has<br><br>
excellent heat resistance and an organic EL device using the amine compoimd which exhibits an excellent luminance of light emission and has a long life of luminance.<br>
As the result of extensive studies by the present inventors to achieve the above object, it was found that the object can be achieved by an amine compound having a specific structure. The present invention has been completed based on the knowledge.<br>

As the process for forming the light emitting layer using the above material, for example, a conventional process such as the vapor deposition process, the spin coating process and the LB process can be used. In particular, it is preferable the light emitting layer is a molecular deposition film. The molecular deposition film is a film formed by deposition of a material compound in the gas phase or a film formed by sohdification of a material compound in a solution or in the liquid state.

The material which is mixed with the amine compound represented by general formula (I) of the present invention and forms the hole injecting and transporting layer is not particularly limited as long as the material has the desirable properties described above.

electron injecting layer using the above materials in accordance with the above process, followed by forming the cathode. The organic EL device may be prepared in the reverse order, i.e., by preparing the cathode first and the anode last.<br>
As an embodiment, preparation of an organic EL device having the construction in which an anode, a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer, an electron injecting layer and a cathode are formed on a substrate transmitting light in this order will be described in the following.<br>
The anode is formed first, A thin film of an anode material is formed on the substrate transmitting light in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process so that the formed thin film has a thickness of 1 \im or smaller and preferably in the range of 10 to 200 nm. The hole injecting layer is then formed on the anode. As described above, the hole injecting layer may be formed in accordance with a process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process and the LB process. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be obtained and the formation of pin holes can be suppressed. When the hole injecting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process are different depending on the compound used (the material of the hole injecting layer) and the crystal structure and the recombination structure of the hole injecting layer to be formed. In general, it is preferable that the temperature of the source of the vapor deposition is selected in the range of 50 to 450""C, the degree of vacuum is selected in the range of 10""^ to 10-3 torr, the rate of vapor deposition is selected in the range of 0.01 to<br><br>
50 nm/second, the temperature of the substrate plate is selected in the range of -50 to 300*0 and the thickness of the film is selected in the range of 5 nm to 5 [im.<br>
The light emitting layer is formed on the hole injecting layer. Using a desired organic light emitting material, a thin film of the organic light emitting material is formed in accordance with a process such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process and the LB process. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since a uniform film can be obtained and the formation of pin holes can be suppressed. When the light emitting layer is formed in accordance with the vacuum vapor deposition process, the conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process is different depending on the compound used. In general, the conditions can be selected in the same ranges as those described above in the formation of the hole injecting layer.<br>
The electron injecting layer is formed on the light emitting layer formed above. Similarly to the formation of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer, it is preferable that the vacuum vapor deposition process is used since the formation of a uniform film is necessary. The conditions of the vacuum vapor deposition process can be selected in the same ranges as those described in the formation of the hole injecting layer and the light emitting layer.<br>
The present invention may be used in various manners in accordance with the type of the layer in the hole transporting area in which the compound is used. When the vacuum deposition process is used, the compound can be vacuum vapor deposited simultaneously with other materials.   When the spin coating process is used, the compound<br><br>
can be used as a mixture with other materials.<br>
The cathode is laminated in the final step and the organic EL device can be obtained. The cathode is constituted with a metal and the vacuum vapor deposition process or the sputtering process can be used for the formation. The vacuum vapor deposition process is preferable since formation of damages in the organic layers formed in previous steps during the formation of the cathode can be prevented.<br>
It is preferable that the steps for preparing the organic EL device fi-om the formation of the anode to the formation of the cathode are conducted after the pressure in the apparatus for the preparation is reduced and while the pressure is maintained at the reduced pressure.<br>
When the organic EL device is used, the Hght emission can be observed when the anode is connected to the positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to the negative electrode (-) and a voltage of 5 to 40 V is applied. When the anode is connected to the negative electrode (-) and the cathode is connected to the positive electrode (+), the light emission is not observed at all. When an alternating voltage is applied, a uniform emission of light is observed only when the anode is connected to the positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to the negative electrode (-).   The wave form of the applied alternating voltage is not limited.<br>
The present invention will be described more specifically with reference to examples in the following. However, the present invention is not limited to the examples.<br>
