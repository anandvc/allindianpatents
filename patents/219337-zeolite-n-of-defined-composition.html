				<td>This invention describes a process for the production of crystalline aluminosilicate zeolites<br>
having the N structure. The products of this process are novel compositions of matter with<br>
exceptional selectivity for ion exchange of certain species from solutions. These novel<br>
products demonstrate physical and chemical characteristics attributable to the method of<br>
production. Zeolite N materials of this invention maybe used as components of ion-exchange<br>
processes; as adsorbents; as molecular sieves or as catalytic materials. Modification of the<br>
surface of zeolite N with surfactants allows the material to adsorb anionic species. Thus, this<br>
novel material can be used in numerous industrial, agricultural, environmental, health and<br>
medical applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolites are three-dimensional, microporous, crystalline solids with well-defined structures<br>
that typically contain aluminium, silicon, and oxygen in a regular framework; cations and<br>
water are located within the framework pores. A representative formula for a zeolite is:<br>
MzAAAIzOa-X SiO2.Y H2O<br>
where M ~ the exchangeable cation, n represents the cation valence, x is equal to or greater<br>
than 2 and Y is the level of hydration. Zeolites are classified in terms of their framework<br>
structure type.<br>
Zeolites with Si:AI ratio between 1.0 and 2.0 such as zeolite A, zeolite P, zeolite X and zeolite<br>
F have been synthesized at industrial scale. General descriptions of the zeolite groups are<br>
detailed in texts by Breck (1974) and Szosak (1998) and prior art referred to in the attached<br>
Bibliography is fully incorporated Into this specification by way of reference.<br>
The crystal structure of hydro-thermally synthesised zeolite N has been determined by<br>
Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) using synchrotron X-ray powder diffraction. This work and a<br>
subsequent study (Christensen and Fjellvag, 1999), used laboratory-scale quantities of<br>
zeolite 4A, sodium aluminosilicate gel and potassium chloride heated in an autoclave at<br>
300°C for 7 days to crystallise zeolite N from a static solution. Structural studies show that<br>
zeolite N is orthorhombic with space group I222. Cell dimensions for hydro-thermally<br>
synthesised zeolite N are a = 9.9041(2), b = 9.8860(2), c = 13.0900(2) with the composition<br>
Ki2AlioSi1004oC!z.8H20 (Christensen and Fjelivag, 1997).<br>
Potassium exchanged aluminosilicates have received little attention in the prior art compared<br>
to the commonly available sodium exchanged zeolites. Barrer identified a group of potassic<br>
zeolites including zeolite F and a form which is now known as zeolite N. Synthetic zeolite K-F<br><br>
2<br>
described by Barrer et a/., (1953) and Barrer and Baynham (1956) was structurally defined by<br>
Baerlocher and Barrer (1974) in the sodium exchanged form. Further work on potassium-<br>
derived zeolites by Barrer and Marcilly (1970) defined salt-bearing forms of zeolites within the<br>
K-F structure type. These aforementioned syntheses were generally via hydrothermal<br>
crystallisation or re-crystallisation of minerals or gels at temperatures greater than 100°C in<br>
an autoclave.<br>
Low yields of zeolite K-F(CI) by hydrothermal recrystallisation of analcite and leucite with<br>
excess KCI is described by Barrer and Marcilly (1970). Barrer and Marcilly (1970) obtained<br>
good yields of zeolite K-F(CI) by hydrothermal synthesis from crystalline Linde Na-X at<br>
temperatures between 200°C and 400°C. Higher yields are obtained at temperatures close to<br>
400°C. Barrer and Marcilly (1970) found that this synthesis procedure using the clay mineral<br>
kaolinite yields kaliophyllite at T &gt; 200°C. Barrer and Marcilly (1970) used X-ray diffraction<br>
data to suggest that these hydro-thermally synthesised zeolites are a tetragonal zeolite K-F<br>
structure. However, more recent work by Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) shows that the<br>
product synthesised under these conditions in the presence of excess KCI is orthorhombic<br>
zeolite N.<br>
A process for the production of X-ray amorphous aluminosilicates or kaolin derivatives<br>
obtained by the chemical modification of clay minerals and other aluminium-bearing minerals<br>
is described in US 6,218,329 and US 5,858,081. In these disclosures, the modification of<br>
clay minerals to form alumlnosilicate or kaolin derivatives involves the mixing of a caustic<br>
reactant in the form of an alkali halide, alkali metal halide, alkali hydroxide or alkali m9tal<br>
hydroxide, or combinations of these reactants, with a clay such as kaolin in the presence of<br>
water at temperatures less than 200°C and preferably less than 100°C. As disclosed in US<br>
6,218,329 and US 5,858,081, for certain reactions trace amounts of zeolite and other<br>
crystalline aluminosilicates such as kalsilite and kaliophyllite may form in addition to the<br>
amorphous aluminosilicate. However, the primary phase is an amorphous (i.e. non-<br>
crystalline) aluminosilicate.<br>
The nomenclature for zeolites has evolved over a period of decades since the early discovery<br>
of hydrothermal synthesis routes by Barren The term "zeolite N" as disclosed in US<br>
3,414,602 and US 3,306,922 was initially used to designate an ammonium or alky!<br>
ammonium substituted cationlc species. However, this nomenclature to describe alkyl<br>
ammonium or ammonium substituted species is no longer practised In order to avoid<br>
confusion (Szostak,1998). Sherman (1977) describes the confusion at the time with<br>
nomenclature for eleven zeolites synthesised in the K2O-AI2O3-SiO2-H2O system and clarifies<br>
relationships for Linde F and zeolite K-F. However, zeolite N is not described in this work by<br>
Sherman (1977).<br><br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the surprising discovery of a process using caustic solutions and<br>
. aluminosilicates such as kaolin and/or montmorillonite which results in the production of<br>
zeolite N by a non-hydrothermal synthesis route. The invention also relates to manufacture of<br>
zeolites with the N structure of many different compositions and in forms characterized by<br>
physical properties not previously known.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for making aluminosilicates<br>
of zeolite N structure including the steps of:<br>
(i) combining a water soluble monovalent cation with a solution of hydroxyl<br>
anions and an aluminosilicate to form a resultant mixture having a pH greater than 10 and a<br>
H2O/AI203 ratio in the range 30 to 220;<br>
(ii) heating the resultant mixture to a temperature of between 50°C and the<br>
boiling point of the mixture for a time of between 1 minute and 100 hours until a crystalline<br>
product of zeolite N structure is formed as determined by X-ray diffraction or other suitable<br>
characteristic; and<br>
(iii)       separating the zeolite N product as a solid from the mixture.<br>
Preferably the water soluble monovalent cation used in step (i) comprises an alkali m9tal<br>
such as potassium or sodium or ammonium ion or mixtures of these ions such as sodium<br>
and potassium. However it will be appreciated that the alkali metal may also comprise Li, Rb<br>
or Cs. Preferably the alkali metal is potassium. The solution of suitable anions may have a<br>
pH greater than 13.<br>
If desired the resultant mixture of step (i) may also include haiide ion such as chloride and in<br>
this embodiment the haiide may have an alkali metal cation or monovalent soluble cation<br>
which may include potassium, sodium or ammonium or mixtures thereof such as sodium and<br>
potassium. It will also be appreciated that the alkali metal may also comprise Li, Rb or Cs.<br>
Preferably the alkali metal is potassium.<br>
In step (i) the aluminosilicate may have an Si:AI ratio in the range 1.0 to 5.0 and more<br>
preferably in the range 1.0 to 3.0.<br>
In step (ii) the heating step is preferably carried out at temperatures in the range 80°C to -<br>
95°C. Preferably the reaction time is in the range 2 to 24 hours.<br>
In step (iii) the solid product may be separated from the caustic liquor by suitable means such<br>
as, for example, by washing or filtration.<br><br>
■	4<br>
Surprisingly, zeolites of N structure are formed at low temperature (less than 100°C) and<br>
without use of potassium chloride as an essential starting reactant as taught in the prior art.<br>
Contrary to prior art, zeolite N may be formed in the presence of caustic solutions such as<br>
KOH or NaOH although alkali halides such as NaCI may also be present.<br>
The disclosed process enables the production of many varieties of zeolite with the N<br>
. structure, in general, the compositions of zeolite N achievable by the synthesis process can<br>
be described by the formula:<br>
(ML,. P,)i2(Ali,Sle)10O«(Xw, Yd)2 nH2O Where<br>
M = alkali metal or ammonium (e.g. K, Na, NH4); P = alkali metal, ammonium or<br>
metal cations exchanged in lieu of alkali metal or ammonium ion, X = Cl or other<br>
halide and Y = OH, hafide or other anion;<br>
fbrO^a 
Therefore the above formula equates to the term "zeolite N structure" as used herein.<br>
As exemplified below, the method of the invention may give rise to potassium-only,<br>
potassium and sodium, potassium and ammonium and potassic high silica forms of zeolite N.<br>
Surprisingly, other forms of zeolite N produced by the disclosed invention include a<br>
potassium-only form with hydroxyl ion as the anion rather than chloride. These compositional<br>
variants have common properties arising from the method of production as described below.<br>
Other compositional variations to the forms described below are possible as will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Zeolites of this invention display a characteristically high proportion of external surface area<br>
(with values greater than 5m2/g),.a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern as shown in Figures 2,<br>
5 and 6 and a high selectivity to ammonium and certain metal ions in the presence of alkali<br>
metal and alkaline earth ions in solution. In a powder X-ray diffraction pattern, the product of<br>
this process to make zeolite N shows a high background between the region 25° 
This high background intensity which ranges between 5% and 15% of the maximum peak<br>
height, may extend beyond 28 = 35° up to 20 = 70°. This high background intensity is not<br>
observed in prior art on hydro-thermally synthesised zeolite N and suggests the presence of<br>
nano-sized crystals and/or amorphous aluminosilicate in association with zeolite N.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, the attributes of zeolite N formed by the process of<br>
this.invention and the proximity of amorphous aluminosilicates (as described in US 6,218,329<br><br>
5<br>
and US 5,858,081) to zeolite N in the phase diagram shown in Figure 1 suggest that<br>
amorphous aluminosilicate derivatives of kaolin (or of montmorillonite) are an intermediate or<br>
transitory phase in the production of zeolite N by this process and thereby imparts physical<br>
properties that cannot be developed through conventional hydrothermal synthesis.<br>
The disclosed process results in aluminosilicates of zeolite N structure possessing the<br>
following properties:<br>
(a)	high selectivity for exchange of ammonium ions (ranging from 75% to 100%) in the<br>
presence of alkali metal and/or alkaline earth ions in aqueous solutions with a wide<br>
range of pH values, especially in comparison to other zeolites with Si:AI ~ 1.0<br>
(b)	high selectivity for exchange of metal ions (ranging from 30% to 100 %) such as<br>
copper, cadmium, zinc, nickel, cobalt and lead in the presence of alkali metal and/or<br>
alkaline earth ions in aqueous solutions with a wide range of pH values, especially in<br>
comparison to other zeolites with Si:AI ~ 1.0<br>
(c)	BET surface area values greater than 1 m2/g, preferably greater than 5 m2/g and<br>
less than 150m2/g<br>
(d)	a high proportion of external surface area to internal surface area especially<br>
compared with other zeolites with SiAl ~ 1.0<br>
(e)	capacity to absorb ammonia gas between 0°C and 300°C<br>
(f)	absorption capacity for oil ranging from 50g/100g to 150g/100g,<br>
(g)	compositions with ratios of silicon to aluminium ranging from 1.0 to 5.0 preferably<br>
from 1.0 to 3.0,<br>
(h) cation exchange capacity ranging from 100meq/100g to 700meq/100g, preferably<br>
greater than 200meq/100g for ammonium ions in solution with concentrations<br>
between less than 1 mg/L to greater than 10,000mg/L,<br>
(i) when in an ammonium-exchanged form, capacity to re-exchange alkali metal ions<br>
from caustic solutions (e.g. NaOH or KOH) ranging in concentration from 0.1 M to<br>
2.0 M, preferably between 0.4 M and 1.5 M<br>
0')   removal rate of ammonium ranging between 50 % and 100 %, preferably between<br>
90 % and 100 %, from ammonium-loaded zeolite N using a caustic only regenerant<br>
solution and<br>
(k)  capacity to re-exchange ammonium ions and/or retain high selectivity for ammonium<br>
ions after regeneration with a caustic only solution.<br>
Many of these properties, having been disclosed for zeolite N of this invention, may also be<br>
attributable to zeolite N of the prior art or zeolite N formed by other processes. However<br>
properties (c), (d) and (f) are believed to be only applicable to zeolite N of the present<br>
invention.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Zeolite N Synthesis<br>
Table 1 refers to a comparison of reaction conditions for selected zeolites produced by prior<br>
art. Table 1 shows that Barrer etal. (1953) did not produce high yields of zeolite N, but rather,<br>
produced mixtures of kalsilite and zeolite N or leucite and zeolite N. In their work, Barrer et<br>
al. (1953) used high temperatures (450°C), long times (1 -2 days) and high quantities of<br>
water and potassium salt to produce a potassium-only zeolite N. Barrer and Marcilly (1970)<br>
used a stoichiometric amount of KOH and a high excess of KCI but did not produce a zeolite<br>
N from a kaolin starting material. Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) use an excess of KCI with<br>
a sodium aluminosilicate zeolite to produce zeolite N of composition KuAlioSiwO^Cb.SHaO.<br>
In particular, the present invention produces a form of zeolite N which is broader in scope<br>
that that produced by Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) as will be apparent from the foregoing.<br>
The present invention surprisingly produces a form of zeolite N by mechanical mixing of<br>
different reactants, individually or in combination, over a wide range of concentrations at<br>
ambient pressures below 'IOO°C. The present invention offers many starting reactants to<br>
produce many different compositions of zeolite with the N structure. Examples of starting<br>
compositions for specific reaction conditions to produce zeolite N in accordance with the<br>
invention are given in Table 2. Aluminosilicates such as kaolin or montmorilionite are<br>
preferred starting materials for the present invention.<br>
Once the product is formed, additional procedures for manufacture may comprise<br>
i.   washing of the zeolite N product to remove excess salts followed by subsequent drying<br>
of the solid product<br>
ii.   re-use of the caustic liquor as part of a caustic solution for subsequent production of<br>
additional zeolite N by the same process and<br>
iii.   re-use of the washing solution for subsequent production of zeolite N by the same<br>
process.<br>
In contrast, prior art teaches the use of hydrothermal synthesis in a static mixture using an<br>
autoclave to enhance crystallisation from an aluminosilicate gel or zeolite A. Zeolite N of a<br>
specific composition is formed by one specific ratio of reactants in the prior art (Christensen<br>
and Fjellvag, 1997).<br>
In Table 2, specific examples of the present invention (Examples 1,4,5,6,7,9,1 o, 11 and<br>
12) are compared with prior art for production of zeolite N (Christensen and Fjellvag, 1997).<br>
Table 2 shows that reaction parameters by which this synthesis procedure are described<br><br>
9<br>
such as K2O/AI2O3, KCI/AI2O3, H2O/AI2O3, Na2O/AI2O3) NaCI/A!2O3, CI/SiO2, K/(K+Na) and<br>
(K+Na-AI)/Si (i.e. in their totality), are markedly different from prior art.<br>
Preferred ratios of reagents for the potassic and sodic compositions of zeolite N by the<br>
disclosed process over the temperature range 80°C to 95°C may comprise<br>
(a)	K2O/AI2O3 between 0.3 and 15.0,<br>
(b)	KCI/AI2O3 between 0.0 and 15.0,<br>
(c)	Na2O/Al2O3 between 0.0 and 2.5,<br>
(d)	NaCI/AI2O3 between 0.0 and 2.8,<br>
(e)	CI/SiO2, between 0.0 and 6.5,<br>
(f)	K/(K+Na) between 0.5 and 1.0 and<br>
(g)	(K+Na-AI)/Si between 2.0 and 18.0, preferably between 3.0 and 11.0.<br>
Similar ratios of other reagents may also be used under similar circumstances to produce the<br>
appropriate compositional form of zeolite N.<br>
In contrast, Examples 15 and 16 (also summarised in Table 2) show the outcome for<br>
synthesis conditions using the methods of the present invention (i.e. mechanical agitation at<br>
ambient pressure at T 
Fjellvag (1997; Example 15) and for similar H2O/AI2O3 ratio used to define the phase diagram<br>
in Figure 1 (Example 16). In both cases, the product is zeolite A rather than zeolite N.<br>
Phase Diagram<br>
Systematic evaluation of reaction variables for a spscific temperature (e.g. 95°C) and water<br>
content (e.g. 48 
formation of zeolite N by the present invention may be described by the ratios of reagents in<br>
the mixture. Figure 1 shows a ternary phase diagram for zeolite N production defined by the<br>
major components K, Na and Cl. The data in Figure 1 are for a reaction temperature of 95°C<br>
for 6 hours.<br>
The stability field for zeolite N formation will vary with temperature and water content but over<br>
a range of values will remain substantially as described in Figure 1. For example, at lower<br>
temperature of reaction, the phase field broadens in comparison to that shown in Figure 1.<br>
Evidence for this is given in Example 10 in which the formation of zeolite N occurs at K=1.0 at<br>
a temperature of 90°C. For comparison, the prior art process by Christensen and Fjellvag<br>
(1997) cannot be plotted on this ternary diagram.<br>
As exemplified in Figure 1, other phases may form if the conditions differ from the broad<br>
process of the present invention. For example, if the sodium content in a reaction mix is high,<br>
sodalite may form. Alternatively, potassium-rich phases such as kaltophyllite or kalsilite may<br><br>
10<br>
form outside the conditions delineated for the present invention. The formation of<br>
aluminosilicate derivatives or kaolin amorphous derivatives - as described in US 6,218,329<br>
and US 5,858,081 (designated "KAD" in the ternary diagram) - may also occur outside the<br>
conditions for formation of zeolite N of this invention.<br>
The relationships between these phases - sodalite, zeolite N and KAD - are demonstrated in<br>
Figure 1. A representative X-ray powder diffraction pattern for zeolite N of the present<br>
Invention is shown in Figure 2 (data for Example 7). Note the relatively high background<br>
intensity (between 5% and 10% of maximum peak height) common to these forms of zeolite<br>
N.<br>
The region between the dotted and solid lines in Figure 1 defines approximately the formation<br>
conditions for materials previously described in US 6,218,329 and US 5,858,081. Example 18<br>
demonstrates that - in comparison to the form of zeolite N of this invention - amorphous<br>
aluminosificates form in that segment of the phase diagram shown in Figure 1 as "KAD". For<br>
reference, an X-ray diffraction pattern of this amorphous aluminosilicate as described in<br>
Example 18 is shown in Figure 3.<br>
Figure 4 is a phase diagram showing H20/Al203 versus cation ratio for the formation of<br>
zeolite N and sodalite for reaction temperature of 95°C and time of six hours. In this figure,<br>
data from the present invention are plotted as diamonds, sodalite as squares and the prior art<br>
from Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) as a triangle. Reaction parameters for zeolite N of the<br>
present invention are significantly different to that of prior art and lies at higher cation ratio<br>
values compared with sodalite. Figure 4 highlights the wide difference in water content<br>
between conventional hydrothermal synthesis and the method described in this disclosure for<br>
zeolite N production.<br>
Zeolite N Structure and Compositions<br>
Zeolite N is classified within the EDI type framework as defined by the international zeolite<br>
association (www.zeolites.ethz.ch/zeolites). The composition of Zeolite N according to the<br>
study by Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) is K12AlioSi1004oCI2.8H20. Compositional variations<br>
on this formula defined by Christensen and Fjellvag (1997) have not been disclosed for<br>
zeolite N in the prior art.<br>
The products of the present Invention include a wide variety of compositions which are<br>
determined by the starting compositions represented, for example, by the phase diagrams<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 4. Another aspect of the invention is the surprising production of<br>
different compositional forms of zeolite N through the procedure of the present invention. The<br>
com positional forms produced by this novel non-hydrothermal synthesis route include those<br><br>
11<br>
described in Table 3 and thus, extend the suite of zeolite N materials formed by hydrothermal<br>
and non-hydrothermal synthesis routes. Specific examples of synthesis related to each<br>
compositional form are given in Table 3.<br>
An X-ray powder diffraction pattern for zeolite N of the present invention with high Si:AI ratio<br>
derived from montmorillonite (Example 9) is shown in Figure 5. Bulk chemical analysis and<br>
calculation of product stoichiometry suggest that Mg and/or Fe may be incorporated into the<br>
structure. As noted in Table 3, stoichiometric evaluation of bulk chemical analyses for<br>
products of this process suggest the presence of other ions (such as OH and/or NO) within<br>
the zeolite N structure. A form of zeolite N of the present invention in which OH ion replaces<br>
the Cl ion within the structure is given in Example 10. An X-ray powder diffraction pattern for<br>
this zeolite N is shown in Figure 6.<br>
A set of indexed reflections for Examples 9,10 and 11 are compared with indices determined<br>
by Christensen and Fjellvag (1 997) in Table 4. Variations in the intensity of key reflections in<br>
the regions 11.0° 
compositional variants compared to the potassium-only form identified by Christensen and<br>
Fjellvag (1997).<br>
X-ray powder diffraction patterns for all examples identified as zeolite N in this description<br>
follow the type patterns shown in Figures 2,5 and 6 and the data shown in Table 4. Materials<br>
produced with these characteristic X-ray diffraction patterns are encompassed within this<br>
invention.<br>
Recycling of Caustic Solution during Synthesis<br>
For the present invention, recycled caustic reagent may be repeatedly used to produce high<br>
yield of zeolite N. The quantity of caustic liquor available for recycling after the initial reaction<br>
is dependent upon the efficiency of solid-liquid separation technique used. The efficiency of<br>
filter pressing, centrifugation or other such separation techniques will be appreciated by<br>
those skilled in the art.<br>
Comparison of the caustic usage for the production of an equivalent mass of zeolite N as a<br>
result of (a) no recycle of caustic and (b) caustic recycle is summarised in Table 5. For<br>
Example 1 and the use of caustic recycle shown in Example 2, the quantity of caustic used<br>
with recycled liquor to produce 783 kg of zeolite N Is reduced to 61 % of the quantity used in<br>
reactions without recycle. The caustic to product ratio is reduced to the values shown in<br>
Table 6 when up to eight times recycle of the liquor is included in the manufacturing process.<br>
A greater or lesser number of recycling steps can be implemented with similar outcome(s) to<br>
that provided in the examples below.<br><br>
12<br>
Such high proportions of caustic liquor recycle are. not evident for hydrothermal synthesis<br>
methods of zeolites, particularly those with 1 
Re-use of the separated caustic liquor after reaction to form zeolite N of this invention is not<br>
limited to potassic forms of caustic reagents or their mixtures inasmuch as sodic or other<br>
suitable forms of caustic reagent, their mixtures (for example, sodium hydroxide and sodium<br>
chloride) and mixtures with potassic or other alkali forms are suitable candidates.<br>
Properties of Zeolite N<br>
A summary of bulk properties for zeolite N of the present invention is shown in Table 6. This<br>
table shows that cell dimensions, bulk composition, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and<br>
BET surface area will vary depending on the starting chemistry of the disclosed process.<br>
However, all properties remain within the broad range of values for each parameter defined<br>
in the claims of this invention. For example, with a higher Si/AI ratio, the CEC value for<br>
Example 9 is lower than achieved for zeolite N formed by the processes described in<br>
Examples 1 and 4. This difference in CEC value Is related to the Si/AI ratio of the resulting<br>
product. In both cases, the CEC value approaches the theoretical limit for an aluminosilicate<br>
of the respective Si:AI ratio.<br>
The ion-exchange behaviour in zeolites is complex and not completely understood<br>
(Weitkamp and Puppe, 1999) and without wishing to be bound by theory, ion-exchange<br>
kinetics and selectivity is related to a combination of factors including zeolite pore size, zeolite<br>
pore shape, the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the zeolite framework and the electrostatic<br>
potential in zeolite channels.<br>
Yet another aspect of this invention is the production of compositional varieties of zeolite N by<br>
room temperature ion-exchange in an aqueous solution, ion-exchanged forms produced from<br>
the present invention Include those described in Table 3.<br>
Element substitution via exchangeable cations in the zeolite N structure of the present<br>
invention include: sodium, ammonium, copper, zinc, nickel, cadmium and silver for<br>
potassium and/or sodium and/or ammonium (Examples 19,20,33 and 35). X-ray diffraction<br>
patterns of these exemplifications demonstrate that zeolite N is formed by the methods<br>
described herein.<br>
The proportion of external or internal exchange sites present in an aluminosilicate framework<br>
influences exchange behaviour in small pore zeolites. Conventional zeolites comprising<br>
micrometre-sized particles typically contain the majority of exchange sites in the internal<br><br>
13<br>
channels with only a small percentage of the exchange sites present on the external surface.<br>
For example, for a spherical zeolite particle of 1 micron diameter the external surface area is<br>
approximately 3 m2/g whereas the Internal surface area may be 500 mz/g or more. In this<br>
case, the external surface area represents less than 1 % of the internal surface area. This is<br>
generally the case for hydro-thermally synthesised zeolites of small Internal pore size (/.e. 
0.38nm) and, it Is speculated, applies to the form of zeolite N of the prior art.<br>
Alternatively, nano-crystalline zeolites contain a much greater fraction of external surface<br>
sites and, for zeolites of small internal pore size, this is reflected In the surface area<br>
measurements determined by conventional BET methods. For example, 100 nm-sized<br>
zeolite particles have an external surface area approximately 30 m2/g.<br>
The small internal pore sizes for zeolite N {ranging from 0.28 to 0.30 nm in effective<br>
diameter) preclude the measurement of internal surface area by conventional adsorption of<br>
nitrogen gas at liquid nitrogen temperatures (the standard BET method) as the kinetic<br>
diameter of nitrogen gas is 0.368 nm. Thus, the surface area for zeolite N measured by the<br>
BET method is the area of the external zeolite surface. The external surface areas for zeolite<br>
N of the present invention are listed for Examples 1 to 20 in Table 6.<br>
The BET surface area for zeolite 4A, a structure also with a small internal pore size, Is less<br>
than 2.5 mz/g. A comparison with products of the present invention shows that in all cases,<br>
the external surface area for zeolite N is greater than hydro-thermally synthesised zeolite 4A.<br>
For zeolite N of the present invention, surface area values are greater than 5m2/g and In<br>
some cases are significantly higher at 55m2/g and 100mz/g. These surface area values imply<br>
that the primary particle size is sub-micrometer in dimension and that the bulk of the products<br>
formed by the disclosed process are nano-crystaliine. Electron microscopy on the products<br>
of the present invention confirms that primary particle sizes range between 50 nm and 500<br>
nm in two dimensions. Zeolite N of the present invention commonly forms laths although<br>
other morphologies are possible.<br>
A possible link between the amorphous aluminosilicate represented by the X-ray diffraction<br>
pattern in Figure 3 and the zeolite N of this invention is summarised by the three patterns<br>
shown in Figure 7. The three X-ray diffraction patterns show (a) amorphous aluminosilicate<br>
as described in Example 18, (b) a combination of amorphous aluminosilicate and minor<br>
amounts of zeolite N of this Invention and (c) zeolite N of this invention as described in<br>
Example 8. Each material in Figure 7 has been prepared by the methodology described in<br>
this invention but with starting compositions that represent three different positions on the<br>
phase diagram in Figure 1.<br><br>
14<br>
In this figure, residual (un-reacted kaolin) peaks are marked "K". A close relationship<br>
between the key basal spacings of the starting clay (e.g. the (001) reflection of kaolin) and<br>
key peaks (e.g. the (110) reflection) of zeolite N of this invention is apparent. Similarly, the<br>
(002) reflection for kaolin at d~3.57A is closely related to the (220) reflection of zeolite N of<br>
this invention.<br>
While not wishing to be bound by theory, these similarities in d-spacings for key reflections<br>
imply a re-arrangement of atoms within a Si-AI network resulting in key spacings within the<br>
zeolite N structure. In addition, the similarity of structural data implies a transformation to the<br>
zeolite N structure from kaolin (or montmorillonite or other aluminosilicate) via an<br>
intermediate phase which may be the amorphous aluminosilicate described in US 6,218,329<br>
B1 and US 5,858,081 and reproduced in Example 18.<br>
Indirect support for this interpretation is revealed in the higher than expected background<br>
intensity for X-ray powder diffraction patterns when normalised against a calibration standard<br>
such as quartz. With normalisation, background intensities range from 5% to 15% of<br>
maximum peak height in powder X-ray diffraction patterns of zeolite N of the present<br>
invention. In comparison, the diffraction pattern described byChristensen and Fjellvag (1997)<br>
shows background intensity less than 1% of the peak height as is common for hydro-<br>
. thermally crystallised zeolites.<br>
As disclosed in Example 21, the ammonium exchange capacity for zeolite N is higher than<br>
other zeolitic materials. Thus, zeolite N is a suitable material for the removal of ammonium<br>
ions in water or wastewaters. Comparisons of ammonium removal using other zeolites with<br>
Si:AI - 1.0 and with natural zeolites such as clinoptilolite demonstrate that zeolite N Is a<br>
superior material for this purpose.<br>
Examples 22 and 23 show that zeolite N as disclosed In Examples 1 and 19 shows higher<br>
ammonium ion selectivity than zeolite A or clinoptilolite in the presence of a single alkaline<br>
earth or alkali metal ion (e.g. Ca2+ or Na+ as disclosed in Example 22) or mixtures of alkaline<br>
earth ions (e.g. Ca2+ and Mg2* as disclosed in Example 23). Surprisingly, zeolite N has a<br>
much higher selectivity for ammonium in the presence of a high sodium ion concentration<br>
than zeolite A.<br>
Other instances of higher selectivity for ammonium in the presence of many competing ions<br>
(such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium) are described in Examples 27,28,29<br>
and 30. Granulated forms of zeolite N similarly show higher loading capacity and higher<br>
selectivity for ammonium Ions compared with granulated forms of zeolite A or clinoptilolite (as<br><br>
15<br>
disclosed in Examples 25,26 and 27) over a wide range of ammonium ion concentrations.<br>
Furthermore, Examples 27 and 28 show that zeolite N is an effective material for the removal<br>
of ammonium ion in sewage treatment plants and Example 38 shows that anions may be<br>
absorbed from wastewaters using zeolite N. Data from Example 29 show that zeolite N<br>
removes ammonium from landfill leachate. Examples 24,26 and 29 show that the capacity of<br>
zeolite N for ammonium removal is retained or higher than the first loading cycle after<br>
regeneration using a caustic only solution.<br>
Example 39 shows that zeolite N absorbs oil at capacities greater than other aluminosilicates<br>
such as attapulgite, zeolites X and P and toentonite.<br>
If zeolite N is loaded with ammonium tons, removal of the ammonium species and<br>
regeneration of material can be achieved by re-exchange with a solution comprising alkali<br>
ions such as sodium. However, the use of salt solutions may not be chemically efficient for<br>
many zeolite types and the resultant brine solution can be difficult to dispose or re-use in an<br>
environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner.<br>
Zeolite N of this invention can be regenerated by any of the known means in the prior art and,<br>
as shown in Examples 24, 26 and 29, is amenable to regeneration by means of solutions<br>
comprising only sodium hydroxide. This latter behaviour is in contrast to previously disclosed<br>
literature which advocates the use of sodium chloride based solutions. Furthermore, a 1.2M<br>
NaOH regenerant solution provides high efficiency of ammonium capture when used on<br>
ammonium-loaded zeolite N. In contrast, and as disclosed in Example 26, cfinoptilolile<br>
ammonium removal performance is degraded substantially after regeneration with a 1.2M<br>
NaOH solution.<br>
Zeolite N exchanges with a range of cationic species such as transition metals (including but<br>
not limited to Cu, Zn, Ni, Co) and heavy metals (including but not limited to Cd, Ag and Pb) as<br>
described in Examples 33 and 37. Similar exchange will occur for lanthanides and actinides<br>
with zeolite N of this invention. Zeolite N may be In the form of a powder or as a pellet or<br>
granule. Any soluble salt of the cation to be exchanged with zeolite N can be employed;<br>
examples include metal chlorides, nitrates or sulphates.<br>
This invention relates to use of zeolite N (prepared as disclosed in Example 1) through<br>
exchange with anti-microbiologically active ions such as zinc, copper and silver (as described<br>
in Example 33). The method of preparation of the zeolite N material with antimicrobial ions<br>
can be varied in accord with the following limitations. The identity of the silver, copper or zinc<br>
precursor species is not critically important provided the precursor salt is soluble in water.<br><br>
16<br>
For instance, nitrate salts are very soluble and easy to use and other salts are available for<br>
use.<br>
Co-exchange of silver and/or copper and/or zinc and/or ammonium ions together with zeolite<br>
N can provide an effective multi-purpose antibacterial material as disclosed in Example 35.<br>
Zeolite N has exceptional capacity for ammonium ions and, without wishing to be bound by<br>
theory, it is proposed that the ammonium ions may help avoid discoloration of the zeolite<br>
when in use. Drying of the co-exchanged material is performed at a temperature less than<br>
400 °C, preferably less than 250 °C and more preferably at a temperature less than 150 °C.<br>
The loading rates for ammonia gas absorption for Zn- and Ag-exchanged zeolite N are<br>
described in Example 37. In these examples, ammonia gas is absorbed in the presence of<br>
water and other gases at temperatures greater than 50°C. The loading of ammonia gas onto<br>
metal-exchanged zeolite N is effective at a range of temperatures from 0°C to 350°C. Data in<br>
Table 13 for Example 37 show that loading rates greater than 30g NH3 per kg of zeolite N can<br>
be achieved at temperatures higher than 80°C for gas streams containing between 8% and<br>
30% water, between 10% and 15% CO2 and 1,000 ppm NH3.<br>
Similarly, proton-exchanged zeolite N of this invention absorbs ammonia gas. Alkali*<br>
exchanged zeolite N is exchanged with a solution of ammonium species until approximately<br>
100 % exchange is achieved. Subsequently, the ammonium-exchanged zeolite N is heated to<br>
decompose the ammonium species to protons without loss of zeolite N structure. A<br>
temperature of 300 °C for a period of at least several minutes is sufficient to decompose the<br>
majority of the ammonium species while minimising the extent of dehydroxylation and<br>
maximising the formation of proton-exchanged zeolite N.<br>
If zeolite N Is loaded with adsorbed ammonia gas, a means of regeneration is by thermal<br>
swing desorption. This regeneration involves heating ammonia-loaded zeolite N material in<br>
an atmosphere such as air or inert gas to a temperature sufficient to desorb the ammonia.<br>
The temperature required for desorption depends upon the identity of the exchangeable ion<br>
on the zeolite N framework and can be found by techniques such as, but not limited to,<br>
temperature programmed desorption (TPD), differential thermal analysis (DTA) or<br>
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA).<br>
Preparation of surfactant modified zeolite N can be achieved by any of the known methods in<br>
the prior art. The basic principle involves contacting zeolite N with an aqueous solution of the<br>
surfactant species for sufficient time to obtain optimum exchange of the surface sites on the<br>
zeolite. Quaternary amine salts are species of choice and examples of these compounds<br>
include hexadecyltrimethylammonium (HDTMA), benzyltrirnethylarnmonium chloride (BTMA),<br><br>
17<br>
tetraethylammonium bromide (TEA), benzyldimethyltetradecylammonium (BDTMA), tert-butyl<br>
ammonium bromide, hexadecylpyridinium (HDPY), tetramethylammonium (TMA),<br>
trimethylphenylammonium (TMPA) and dioctodecyldimethyiammonium (DODMA). Naturally,<br>
there exist many other suitable surfactants to modify the surface of the zeolite N material.<br>
The present invention relating to the process to make zeolite N offers the following<br>
advantages:<br>
1.	high yields of zeolite N (achieves &gt;90%) in large volume production<br>
2.	temperature of reaction is low (i.e. 
3.	volumes of solution required are low<br>
4.	feed liquor can be supplemented by recycled liquor from a previous batch of zeolite<br>

the presence of alkali metal and alkaline earth ions compared with existing<br>
aluminosilicates<br>

from solutions compared with other existing aluminosilicates<br>
3.	capacity to be formed into granules suited to fixed bed exchange columns for<br>
ion exchange of alkali metal, alkaline earth, ammonium, transition metal, rare<br>
earth and actinide metal ions<br>

granules and/or as powders) using a caustic only solution such as NaOH or<br>
KOH or mixtures thereof<br>

existing aluminosilicates such as zeolites 4A, clinoptilolite and bentonite<br>
6.	improved capacity to remove metal ions from solutions compared with existing<br>
aluminosilicates such as zeolites 4A, clinoptiiolite, bentonite and kaolinite<br>

zeolites 4A, X, P, bentonite and kaolinite<br>

selectively exchangeable material useful for agricultural, antibacterial and other<br>
applications<br>

ammonia gas<br>

11.	capacity to adsorb complex compounds to impart a hydrophobic character<br>

While the invention has been described in connection with a preferred embodiment, it is not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the invention to the particular form setforth, but on the contrary,<br>
it is intended to cover such alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as maybe included<br>
within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
STANDARD PROCEDURES<br>
For zeolite N reactions at bench and pilot plant scale, stainless steel reactors equipped with<br>
(i) a mixing blade, (Ii) an external heating coil with thermocouple and (iii) a loose-fitting.cover<br>
have been employed. For many reactions at scales &gt; 600 g, samples of the mix are<br>
extracted during the reaction in order to measure standard parameters. Measurements of<br>
pH for these reaction mixtures are obtained from samples held between 60°C and 65°C.<br>
Methods for characterisation of solid products include X-ray powder diffraction, surface area<br>
analysis, bulk elemental analysis and cation exchange capacity for ammonium ion. X-ray<br>
data were collected on a Bruker automated powder diffractometer using CuKct radiation<br>
(X=1.5406) between 5° and 70° 20 at a scan speed of 1° 28 per minute using quartz as a<br>
calibration standard. The International Centre for Diffraction Data files were used to identify<br>
major phases in all samples. Cell dimensions for zeolite N samples were obtained by least-<br>
squares refinement from X-ray powder diffraction patterns. Least-squares refinements on<br>
cell dimensions require a two-theta tolerance of ±0.1° (i.e. difference between observed and<br>
calculated reflections) for convergence.<br>
Surface area measurements were obtained on a Micrometrics Tri-Star 3000 instrument using<br>
the BET algorithm for data reduction and standard procedures for adsorption and desorption<br>
of nitrogen. Bulk elemental analyses for major elements were obtained by inductively coupled<br>
plasma spectroscopy (ICP) using standard peak resolution methods.<br>
Cation exchange capacities were determined experimentally for equilibrium exchange of<br>
ammonium ion in a 1M NH4CI solution. The procedure for determination of experimental CEC<br>
values described in this work is as follows:<br>
0.5 g of the material is dispersed into 25 ml of RO water and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes. After decanting the supernatant for measurement of potassium ions, 30 ml of 1M<br>
NH4CI is added in solution to the samples, shaken to disperse particles and allowed to agitate<br><br>
19<br>
for a period of 16 hours. The equilibrated solution is then centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10<br>
minutes and the supernatant solution discarded. Yet again, 30 ml of 1M NH4CI solution is<br>
added and the solids dispersed by shaking and agitated for two hours. Repeat this process<br>
for ammonium exchange a further time.   Following the third centrifuge event 30 ml of<br>
absolute ethanol is added to wash the sample, mixed and then centrifuged for 10 minutes.<br>
The ethanol wash process is repeated using an additional 30 ml of absolute ethanol a further<br>
two times. Subsequently, 30 ml of 1M KCI solution is added to the samples and agitated for<br>
a period of 16 hours. The samples are then centrifuged for 10 minutes and the supernatant<br>
decanted into a clean 100 mL volumetric flask. Again, 30 ml of 1M KCI solution is added to<br>
the solid sample, shaken and agitated for two hours. Repeat centrifuge, decant into clean<br>
100 mL flasks, add KCI solution and agitate a further two times.  Make up each of the<br>
volumetric flasks with decanted supernatant to 100 ml with 1M KCI solution.  Finally, all<br>
samples are analysed for ammonium ion concentration using the method by Kjeldahl (steam<br>
distillation). The cation exchange capacity for each sample is then calculated from these<br>
data.<br>
This method for CEC determination when used on a well-known clay material (Cheto<br>
montmorfllonite, AZ, Clay Minerals Society Source Clays SAz-1; van Olphen and Fripiat,<br>
1979) as an internal calibration standard gives a CEC value of 98.1 ± 2.5 meq/100g (54<br>
analyses over a period of eighteen months). This value is consistent with the value for<br>
potassium exchange on SAz-1 of 100 + 2 meq/100g determined by Jaynes and Bingham<br>
(1986). If not identified to the contrary, CEC values determined for the material(s)<br>
exemplified in this work are on a "wet weight" basis {i.e. no correction for dry weight of the<br>
material). CEC values determined on a dry weight basis use the same protocol as given<br>
above but with samples dried at 105°C overnight prior to dispersion in water for<br>
measurement of potassium ions.<br>
For applications of zeolite N in practice, it may be necessary to granulate the powder into a<br>
form which is amenable for use in, for example, a fixed bed configuration in a column. The<br>
granulation process includes mixing zeolite powder with a suitable binder material,<br>
subsequent forming into a viable shape such as a spherical or elongate granule and then<br>
calcining the material to impart physical strength. Those skilled in the art will be aware of<br>
many methods and approaches to form granules of zeolitic material. The identity of the<br>
binder is not particularly limited and common materials such as clays, polymers and oxides<br>
may be used. For example, sodium silicate ("water glass") addition at levels up to 20 % is an<br>
effective means to produce granules with suitable mechanical properties. It is desirable to<br>
use the least amount of binder suited to the purpose so that the cation exchange capacity of<br>
zeolite granules is maximised. Calcination of zeolite N is preferably carried out at<br>
temperatures below 600°C and it is more preferable to calcine at temperatures less than<br><br>

The success of ion exchange methods in a fixed bed depends upon a range of engineering<br>
criteria which should be considered when using zeolite N. The size distribution of zeolite<br>
granules and the bulk density have an impact upon trie effective ammonium ion exchange<br>
capacity (Hedstrom, 2001). In addition, hydraulic residence time (or flow rate) and inlet water<br>
composition (e.g. pH, TDS, ammonium ion concentration) influence the outcome of fixed bed<br>
exchange reactions. In the comparative examples used for this disclosure, similar sized<br>
granules (typical range between 1.6mm and 2.5mm) and similar operating conditions have<br>
been used in order to provide clear evidence for the superior performance of zeolite N for<br>
wastewater treatment.<br>
The test for linseed oil absorption is described as follows: 5g of material is kneaded by hand<br>
on a glass plate using a spatula with boiled linseed oil. The linseed oil is added drop-wise<br>
from a burette and the amount required to achieve the end point is measured. The end point<br>
is determined as the point at which the 5g of material is completely saturated with oil and has<br>
a consistency of putty. The volume of oil required to achieve the end point is converted to<br>
weight of oil per weight of material (I.e. g/100g).<br>
EXAMPLES AND ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT<br>
Example 1: Production of zeolite N with KOH and KCI.<br>
75kg of 98% solid potassium hydroxide (Redox Chemicals, caustic potash Capota45, QLD<br>
Australia), 75kg of 98% solid potassium chloride (Redox Chemicals, POCHLO16, QLD<br>
Australia) and 250 litres of water supplied by a conventional domestic reticulated system are<br>
placed in a 500L stainless steel reactor tank. This caustic solution is stirred and heated to<br>
95°C. While the solution is at this temperature, 75kg of kaolin (Kingwhite 65, supplied by<br>
Unimin Pty Ltd, Kingaroy, QLD Australia) is added to the reaction mix while stirring the<br>
solution. The reaction mix experiences a slight drop in temperature (to ~90°C) during the<br>
loading of kaolin. Depending on the quality of heating process employed, the reaction mixture<br>
may show temperature fluctuations of up to 5°C without significant loss of product quality.<br>
Small quantities of solid materials (approximately 50g) from the reaction mix are sampled at<br>
half-hourly intervals during this reaction and are characterised by conventional methods.<br>
The reaction tank is partially covered with a stainless steel lid to aid with retention of heat and<br>
vapour(s). The reaction tank is maintained at ambient pressure during the production<br>
process. The pH of this reaction mix is generally greater than 14.0 and during the course of<br>
the reaction may reduce to approximately 13.5. During the reaction process -approximately<br><br>
21<br>
1.5 hours to 3.5 hours after the kaolin has been added to the reactor - the viscosity of the<br>
mixture increases. Addition of small amounts of water at this time to aid mixing of the slurry<br>
may be undertaken though it is not necessary to achieve production of zeolite N.<br>
After 6.0 hours of reactant mixing at temperatures 95°C ± 5°C, the reaction is stopped by<br>
reduction of the temperature to less than 50°C via cooling coils, addition of water or both<br>
methods and the resulting slurry is separated using a filter press into solid and liquid<br>
components. The solid aluminosilicate - zeolite N - is washed with water and then dried<br>
using conventional drying methods (such as a spray dryer) to form the final product with<br>
properties listed in Table 6. The weight of zeolite N from this reaction is 98.3kg which<br>
represents a volume yield of greater than 90% for the reaction.<br>
Characterisation of the material using standard methods such as X-ray diffraction, bulk<br>
chemical analysis, surface area analysis and cation exchange capacity will be known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Example 2: Recycle of mixed caustic liquor from Example 1 reaction.<br>
120kg of the liquor containing both KOH and KCI and any un-reacted kaolin from the process<br>
described in Example 1 is retained for transfer back to the reaction tank. The reaction tank is<br>
topped up with 254kg of caustic (comprising 59.1kg of KOH, 54.2kg of KCI and 141.4L of<br>
water) and pre-heated to 95°C. 75kg of kaolin is added to the caustic liquor, mixed thoroughly<br>
for 6.0 hours while maintaining the reaction temperature at 95°C ± 5°C. After 6.0 hours, the<br>
reaction tank is cooled to less than 50cC and the resulting slurry is separated into solid and<br>
liquid components using a filter press. The solid is washed with water and then dried using<br>
conventional drying methods (such as a spray dryer) to form the final product with properties<br>
listed in Table 6.<br>
The same procedure given above is repeated for the next seven reactions using appropriate<br>
masses of caustic recycle and caustic make-up for each run. The properties of the resultant<br>
zeolite N from selected batch reactions using recycled liquor are listed in Table 6. Figure 8<br>
shows cation exchange capacities determined for each zeolite N batch produced by the<br>
recycling of caustic liquor and the evolution of CEC values as each reaction proceeds to<br>
completion.<br>
Example 3: Variation of process for zeolite N production - time and method of reaction.<br>

22<br>
in a 500L stainless steel reactor tank. This reaction mix or viscous slurry is stirred and heated<br>
to 95°C over a period of seven hours. Once the slurry is at 95°C, the reaction is maintained at<br>
95°C ± 3°C for a further nine hours and then cooled to less than 50°C to stop the reaction.<br>
The resulting slurry is separated using a filter press into solid and liquid components. The<br>

stirred and heated to 95°C. While the solution is at this temperature, 60kg of kaolin is added<br>
to the reaction mix while stirring the solution.<br>
After 6 hours of mixing at temperatures 95°C + 5°C, the reaction is stopped by reduction of<br>
the temperature to less than 50°C via cooling coils, addition of water or both methods and the<br>
resulting slurry is separated using a filter press into solid and liquid components. The solid<br>

Example 16: Comparative synthesis using Christensen and Fjeilva'g (1997) reactant ratios<br>
and lower water content<br>
The reagents - zeolite 4A and potassium chloride - used by Christensen and Fjellvag (1997)<br>
are combined in the same ratios and subjected to process conditions described in this patent<br>

mixture is the same as described in Example 10.<br>
The reaction is undertaken substantially as described in Example 1 fora period of 24 hours<br>
at 95°C. Sampling of the reaction mix at 6 hours and 12 hours indicated the formation of<br>
kaliophyllite only. The solid aluminosilicate is washed with water and then dried using<br>

Example 19: Exchange of potassium zeolite N to sodium zeolite N form.<br>
20kg of zeolite N formed by the process described in Example 1 are placed in a stainless<br>
steel reaction tank and thoroughly mixed with 2M NaOH solution for two hours at room<br>
temperature (~25°C). The solid and liquid are separated via conventional means (e.g. a filter<br>
press or by sedimentation/decanting). The solid is washed thoroughly in water and then dried<br>
by conventional means (e.g. spray dryer). The solid shows partial exchange of potassium<br>
Ions for sodium ions and the properties listed in Table 6. X-ray powder diffraction confirms<br>
the sodium exchange form is zeolite N. Further exchange of potassium and sodium ions in<br>
zeolite N is effected by additional exchanges of the type described in this example.<br><br>
28<br>
Example 20: Exchange of potassium zeolite N to ammonium zeolite N.<br>
20kg of zeolite N formed by the process described in Example 3 are placed in a stainless<br>
steel reaction tank and thoroughly mixed with 5M NH4NO3 solution held at 70°C for two<br>
hours. The solid and liquid are separated via conventional means (e.g. a filter press or by<br>
sedimentation/decanting), the solid is washed thoroughly in water and then subjected to a<br>
second exchange using 5M NH4NO3 solution held at 70°C for two hours. The solid is washed<br>
thoroughly in water and dried by conventional means (e.g. spray dryer). The solid shows<br>
exchange of potassium Ions for ammonium ions and the properties listed in Table 6. X-ray<br>
diffraction shows the phase has zeolite N structure. Almost complete exchange of potassium<br>
ion is demonstrated by the bulk analysis (K2O=2.0 wt%) and high value for loss-on-ignition<br>
determination (LOI=23.4 wt%).<br>
Example 21;     Comparative Cation Exchange Capacities for Ammonium Ions on a mass<br>
and volume basis<br>
Zeolite 4A (PQ Corporation), Clinoptilolite (Australian Zeolites), montmorillonite (Activebond<br>
23) and kaolinite (Kingwhite 65; Unimin Australia Pty Ltd) are compared with zeolite N<br>
prepared by methods as disclosed in Examples 1.<br>
Cation exchange capacities are determined experimentally for equilibrium exchange of<br>
ammonium ion as described in the Standard Procedures. Table 7 shows that the highest<br>
ammonium ion CEC value, by mass or volume, is for zeolite N described in this invention.<br>
Zeolite A also exhibits good capacity for ammonium ions in accord with a low Si/AI ratio.<br>
However, as shown beiowzeolite A does not satisfy commercial criteria such as ammonium<br>
ion selectivity.<br>
Example 22:     Selectivity of Zeolite N for Ammonium Ions in the Presence of Alkaline Earth<br>
or Alkali Metal Ions Compared to Zeolite A and Clinoptilolite<br>
Zeolite N, zeolite A and clinoptilolite are compared in this example. Amounts of 0.2 g of<br>
zeolite material are placed in 200 mL of aqueous solutions of ammonium ions (prepared from<br>
ammonium chloride) and constantly agitated for a period of 2 hours at ambient temperature.<br>
To evaluate the selectivity of zeolites N, A and clinoptilolite in the presence of alkaline ions,<br>
different amounts of calcium ions (prepared from calcium chloride precursor) are added to<br>
the ammonium ion solution. Figure 9a shows the effect of calcium ion concentration upon<br>
the ammonium loading of zeolites N, A and Clinoptilolite when a constant ammonium ion<br><br>
29<br>
concentration of 50 mg/L is present in the solution.<br>
The capacity for ammonium ion uptake by zeolite N is not significantly influenced by<br>
concentrations of competing calcium ions up to 200 mg/L. In contrast, the capacity for<br>
ammonium ion uptake by zeolite A in the presence of competing calcium ions is significantly<br>
reduced. For example, the loading of ammonium ions changes from 23.5 g/kg when no<br>
calcium ions are present to 7.1 g/kg when 200 mg/L calcium ions are present. The<br>
ammonium loading for zeolite A in the presence of high calcium concentration is similar to<br>
that for clinoptilofite. Clinoptilolite shows low capacity for ammonium ions under all testing<br>
conditions.<br>
To evaluate the selectivity of zeolites N, A and clinoptilolite in the presence of alkali metal<br>
ions, different amounts of sodium ions are added to the ammonium ion solution. Figure 9b<br>
shows the effect of sodium ion concentration upon the ammonium loading of zeolites N, A<br>
and Clinoptilofite when a constant ammonium ion concentration of 50 mg/L is present in the<br>
solution.<br>
The capacity for ammonium ion uptake by zeolite N is not significantly influenced by<br>
concentrations of competing sodium ions up to 400 mg/L. Surprisingly, the capacity for<br>
ammonium ion uptake by zeolite A in the presence of competing sodium ions is significantly<br>
reduced. For example, the loading of ammonium ions changes from 23.5 g/kg when no<br>
sodium ions are present to 8.7 g/kg when 400 mg/L sodium ions are present. Clinoptilolite<br>
shows low capacity for ammonium ions under all testing conditions.<br>
Example 23: Comparative selectivity for ammonium ion in aqueous solutions with Ca2* and<br>
Mg2*ions.<br>
Zeolite 4A (PQ Corporation) and clinoptilolite (Australian Zeolites) are compared with zeolite<br>
N prepared by methods disclosed in Examples 1 and 19. Approximately 0.2 g of zeolite<br>
material is equilibrated at room temperature for 1 hour with 200mL of an aqueous solution<br>
comprising ammonium, calcium and magnesium ions at the concentrations indicated in Table<br>
8. The comparative results determined as equivalent cation exchange capacities for each<br>
zeolite in each solution are tabulated in Table 9.<br>
Table 9 shows that both forms of zeolite N are characterized by a high loading capacity for<br>
ammonium ions in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions. In contrast, zeolite A is not<br>
selective towards ammonium ions in the presence of calcium and magnesium ions.<br>
Furthermore, the data for clinoptilolite shows that calcium and magnesium ion concentration<br><br>
30<br>
actually increases when this material is added to the test solution. The CEC value for<br>
clinoptilolite for ammonium ions is considerably lower than the value recorded for zeolite N.<br>
For solutions containing 1,000 mg/L ammonium Ions, the loading values for ammonium ion<br>
are 444 meq/100g and 451 meq/100g forzeolite N (Examples 1 and 19), respectively, when<br>
50 mg/L calcium ions are present and 475 meq/100g and 434 meq/100g for zeolite N,<br>
respectively, when 120 mg/L calcium ions are present. Consequently, zeolite N is an<br>
excellent material for ammonium ion exchange capacity and ammonium ion selectivity for a<br>
wide range of ammonium and alkaline earth ion concentrations.<br>
In contrast, the performance of zeolite 4A is detrimentally affected by the presence of<br>
additional calcium ions in solution. For solutions containing 1,000 mg/L ammonium ions, the<br>
loading value for zeolite 4A is 261meq/100g when 50mg/L calcium ions are present and<br>
192meq/100g when 120 mg/L calcium ions are present. This represents a drop of over 25%<br>
in the performance of zeolite 4A in the presence of competing Ca and Mg ions.<br>
Clinoptilolite did not show any appreciable exchange for ammonium in the presence of<br>
calcium and magnesium ions with an increased concentration of calcium ions to 120 mg/L.<br>
However, the loading value for ammonium ions is low under all conditions (over 4 times lower<br>
than for zeolite U). Clinoptilolite does not offer properties suited to commercial treatment of<br>
wastewaters for removal of ammonium ions in the presence of Ca*2 and Mg+2.<br>
Example 24:     Regeneration of ammonium-loaded Zeolite N<br>
A series of caustic solutions have been compared for regeneration of an ammonium-loaded<br>
zeolite N. The regenerant solution compositions include industrial grade NaOH (only), NaOH<br>
and NaCI, NaOH and Na2CO3 in a range of concentrations. Ammonium loading of zeolite N<br>
on each cycle is with 1M NH4CI solution.<br>
For regeneration cycles, 20g of ammonium loaded zeolite N is contacted with 80ml of<br>
regenerant solution in a 250mL Nalgene bottle with constant shaking for two hours. The<br>
solution is centrifuged at 3,000rpm forfive minutes and the amount of ammonium and pH of<br>
the supernatant is measured. For second and subsequent regenerations, the same<br>
procedure is used on re-loaded ammonium zeolite N. The removal rate of ammonium ton for<br>
each regenerant solution is determined by measurement of ammonium in the regenerant<br>
solution and on the solid sample before regeneration.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show the effective ammonium removal rate as a percentage of total<br>
ammonium on the material for solutions with different ratios of NaOH+NaCI and<br><br>
31<br>
NaOH+Na2CO3. The data in Figures 10 and 11 show thatfor both combinations of solutions<br>
as a regenerant, removal of ammonium can be achieved at all ratios of NaCI or Na2CO3 to<br>
NaOH. This outcome is consistent with teachings from prior art.<br>
However, for zeolite N of the present invention, a higher removal rate (I.e. &gt; 75%) for<br>
ammonium ion occurs for ratios in which NaOH is present at concentrations equivalent to or<br>
more than 0.4M. Furthermore, these data show that the highest removal rate occurs for<br>
NaOH only solutions. Thus, ammonium-loaded zeolite N is suited to regeneration by NaOH<br>
solutions held at high pH (I.e. greater than 12) without degradation of the material.<br>
The range of NaOH concentrations for which an effective removal rate can be achieved from<br>
ammonium-loaded zeolite N is shown in Figure 12. At low molarify (0.1 M), the removal rate is<br>
low at 40%. However, at higher molarity and, specifically above 0.4M NaOH, the removal rate<br>
is greater than 85% for the first regeneration and higher for the second regeneration. In this<br>
instance, the form of zeolite N is potassic for the first cycle of loading/regeneration and sodic<br>
for the second cycle of loading/regeneration. For subsequent regenerations, removal rates of<br>
&gt;90% are maintained when the molarity is &gt; 0.4M.<br>
This comparison of regeneration solutions shows that ammonium-loaded zeolite N is ideally<br>
suited to regeneration by sodium-rich solutions and, in particular, by NaOH solutions with<br>
molarity greater than 0.4. This result is in contrast to that of Breck (US 3,723,308) who<br>
showed that a saturated lime solution with sodium chloride and calcium chloride is a suitable<br>
regeneration solution for zeolite F and Sherman and Ross (US 4,344,851) who used 1 .ON<br>
NaCI with NaOH (adjusted to pH '12.0) to regenerate zeolites W and F. The data in Figure 10<br>
show that for NaCI/NaOH solutions with pH - 12.0 at high NaCI molarity. the ammonium<br>
removal rate is significantly less than a NaOH only solution (i.e. 32% vs 84% on first cycle;<br>
62% vs 94% on second cycle).<br>
Example 25:     Comparative example of ammonium exchange by Zeolite N and Zeolite A in<br>
a fixed bed column<br>
Granules of test material(s) are loaded into glass columns (<j>~52mm; packed bed height<br>
~750mm) with inlet and outlet openings suited to flow of test solutions and analysis of<br>
samples. The configuration of column arrangements for fixed bed treatment and the<br>
determination of bed volume for each material type are known to those skilled in the art. A<br>
synthetic solution (pH = 7.25) containing 1,020 mg/L NH/ is introduced to the columns via<br>
variable speed pumps at flow rates ranging from 1.2 l/hr to 10.5 l/hr. The solutions are<br>
pumped in a down-flow direction for ammonia loading and in an up-flow direction during<br>
regeneration. Use of regenerant solution(s) for ammonium-loaded zeolite N is described in<br><br>
32<br>
Example 24.<br>
The concentration of ammonium ion in the outflow after pumping through the column and the<br>
volume of solution treated is measured. Test solutions are pumped at a constant bed volume<br>
flow of 4.5 bed volumes per hour or 2.25 bed volumes per hour for each test sample. In each<br>
case, a similar mass of zeolite material is used in each column.<br>
Comparative data for ammonium exchange of zeolite N (as described in Example 1) and<br>
zeolite A are shown in Figures 13 and 14 for the two different flow rates. In both cases, the<br>
"breakthrough" point - for this experiment taken as 50mg/L ammonium concentration in the<br>
treated water - is achieved after a much longer period of time (or volume of water treated) by<br>
zeolite N than by zeolite A. For example, In Figure 13 breakthrough is achieved by zeolite A<br>
after 12 bed volumes while zeolite N achieves breakthrough after 100 bed volumes. Data in<br>
Figure 14 show that zeolite A achieves breakthrough in 14 bed volumes while zeolite N has<br>
not reached breakthrough after 120 bed volumes. Those skilled in the art will recognise that<br>
the performance of zeolite N under these conditions is superior to that of zeolite A.<br>
Example 26:     Comparative ammonium exchange by Zeolite N and Clinoptilolite in a fixed<br>
bed column<br>
Granules of test material(s) are loaded into glass columns ((j&gt;~52mm; packed bed height<br>
~750mm) with inlet and outlet openings suited to flow of test solutions and analysis of<br>
samples as noted in Example 25. A synthetic solution (pH = 7.6) containing 30 mg/L MH4+ is<br>
introduced to the columns and the concentration of ammonium ion in the outflow after<br>
pumping through the column and the volume of solution treated is measured. Test solutions<br>
are pumped at a constant flow of 28 bed volumes per hour for each test sample. In each<br>
case, a similar mass of zeolite material is used in each column. For this test, clinoptilolite is<br>
pre-treated by the methods described in Komarowski and Yu (1997) to optimise ammonium<br>
loading capacity.<br>
Comparative data for ammonium exchange of zeolite N (as described in Example 1) and<br>
clinoptilolite are shown in Figure 15. Two cycles of loading are represented for each zeolite<br>
tested. Each zeolite is regenerated after the first loading using 1.2M NaOH solution as<br>
described in Example 24.<br>
The "breakthrough" point for this experiment is 5 mg/L ammonium concentration in the<br>
treated water. Clinoptilolite shows capacity to remove ammonium from the synthetic solution<br>
for approximately 5 bed volumes In the first loading cycle, but does not achieve ammonium<br>
levels below 5mg/L in the treated solution on the second loading cycle.<br><br>
33<br>
In contrast, zeolite N of the present invention reduces ammonium levels to well-below<br>
breakthrough for at least 3,000 bed volumes in the first loading cycle and for more than 3,750<br>
bed volumes in the second loading cycle after regeneration.<br>
Loading capacity for each zeolite can be determined by simple measurement of ammonium<br>
in the regenerant solution or by integration of ammonium concentration for a full loading cycle<br>
{i.e. to a point where outlet ammonium concentration is 
concentration). Using these methods, the loading capacity for clinoptilolite in this example is<br>
2.3 g NlV per kg of zeolite. This value is consistent with data previously obtained by<br>
Komarowski and Yu (1997) for clinoptilolite. For zeolite N, the loading capacity is 65 g NH4+<br>
per kg of zeolite.<br>
Example 27: Comparative ammonium exchange by zeolite N and clinoptilolite in wastewater<br>
solution containing multiple divalent and univalent ions.<br>
Granules of test materials) are loaded into glass columns (
~750mm) with inlet and outlet openings suited to flow of test solutions and analysis of<br>
samples as noted in Example 25. Wastewater at pH 8.0 produced by an anaerobic digester<br>
side stream in a sewage treatment plant is introduced into the columns after a sand filtration<br>
step to remove suspended solids. Solutions are pumped at a constant flow rate of 2 bed<br>
volumes per hour for each test material. The mass of test material in all columns is<br>
equivalent for zeolite N and clinoptilolite. The digester side stream wastewater shows typical<br>
concentrations for Ca2+ and Mg2+ (43 mg/L and 13 mg/L, respectively), Na+ and lC(320 mg/L<br>
and 230 mg/L, respectively) as well as high levels of alkalinity, BOO, COD and total dissolved<br>
solids (4,500 mg/L, 94 mg/L, 1,300 mg/L and 2,100 mg/L, respectively). The inlet ammonium<br>
ion concentration is 1,528 mg/L.<br>
Comparative data for ammonium exchange using zeolite N (as described in Example 1) and<br>
clinoptilolite are shown in Figure 16. For these experiments, a breakthrough point of 35 mg/L<br>
ammonium ion is achieved by zeolite N after more than 50 bed volumes are treated. In<br>
comparison, the same mass of clinoptilolite does not achieve an outflow concentration less<br>
than 35 mg/L under the same operating conditions. Clinoptilolite only reduces the outflow<br>
ammonium ion concentration to -130 mg/L in the first loading cycle shown in Figure 16.<br>
The poor performance of clinoptilolite In this instance is not only due to a low cation exchange<br>
capacity, but also due to poor selectivity for ammonium ions in the presence of Ca2+, Mgz+,<br>
Na+ and K+. However, zeolite N clearly removes ammonium ion from digester side stream<br>
which contains competing ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ and K* and trace levels of transition<br><br>
34<br>
metals (e.g. Cu2*, Zn2+ and Fe2+).<br>
Example 28: Ammonium ion removal from primary fbw at a sewage treatment plant.<br>
Granules of test material are loaded into glass columns (<j>~52mm; packed bed height<br>
~750mm) with inlet and outlet openings suited to flow of test solutions and analysis of<br>
samples as noted in Exam pie 25. Wastewater at pH ~7.0 collected from the exit of a primary<br>
ciarifier in a large sewage treatment plant is introduced into the columns without a pre-<br>
filtration step to remove suspended solids. Solutions are pumped at constant flow rates of 5<br>
bed volumes per hour and 10 bed volumes per hour. The wastewater shows a typical primary<br>
treated sewage composition for Ca2+ and Mg2+ (30 mg/L and 22 mg/L, respectively), Na+ and<br>
K*(160 mg/L and 18 mg/L, respectively) as well as typical levels of alkalinity, BOD, COD,<br>
suspended solids and total dissolved solids (560 mg/L, 87 mg/L, 100 mg/L, 54 mg/L and 628<br>
mg/L, respectively). The inlet ammonium ion concentration Is 44 mg/L.<br>
Data on the removal of ammonium ion using these exchange columns at two flow rates are<br>
shown in Figure 17. Figure 17 shows that for a breakthrough point of 1 mg/L ammonium ions,<br>
zeolite N is an excellent medium for removal of ammonium at high flow rates. At 10BV/hr<br>
(equivalent to a hydraulic residence time of 6 minutes), zeolite N reduces outflow ammonium<br>
concentrations to less than 1mg/L for more than 650 bed volumes. At lower flow rates (e.g.<br>
5BV/h), ammonium ion concentrations in the treated water remain well below breakthrough<br>
after 1,200 bed volumes. Those skilled in the art will recognise that improved performance of<br>
zeolite N for ammonium ion removal will be achieved with pre-filtration of the inlet column<br>
flow.<br>
Example 29:     Ammonium ion removal from landfill leachate by Zeolite N.<br>
Granules of test material are loaded into glass columns (<j>~52mm; packed bed height<br>
~750mm) with inlet and outlet openings suited to flow of test solutions and analysis of<br>
samples as noted in Example 25. Wastewater at pH ~ 8.2 collected from a landfill is<br>
introduced into the columns without a pre-filtration step to remove suspended solids. The<br>
leachate is pumped at a constant flow rate of 4 bed volumes per hour. The leachate shows<br>
concentrations typical for a mature landfill with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (62 mg/L and 38 mg/L,<br>
respectively), Na* and K* (1,100 mg/L and 340 mg/L, respectively) as well as typical levels of<br>
alkalinity, suspended solids and total dissolved solids (2,200 mg/L, 18 mg/L and 3,700 mg/L,<br>
respectively). The inlet ammonium ion concentration is 205 mg/L.<br>
Data for two successive loadings of ammonium onto the pre-treated zeolite N fixed bed<br><br>
35<br>
columns are shown in Figure 18. Regeneration of the ammonium-loaded zeolite N using<br>
1.2M NaOH solution only follows the methods outlined in Example 24, For this wastewater,<br>
the concentration of sodium and potassium ions is many times the concentration of<br>
ammonium ions (a factor of ~6 times). However, data in Figure 18 show clearly that<br>
ammonium ion concentration is reduced to less than 1 mg/L in the treated outflow for many<br>
bed volumes (e.g. greater than 230 bed volumes at 4 BV/h). Furthermore, the ammonium<br>
loading capacity after regeneration of zeolite N granules is equivalent to, or better than, the<br>
ammonium loading capacity on the first cycle.<br>
Example 30: Use of Zeolite N for ammonium ion removal from an aqueous solution in the<br>
presence of calcium, potassium and sodium ions at typical levels for ruminal fluid.<br>
Zeolite 4A and clinoptilolite are compared with zeolite N as described in Examples 1 and 19.<br>
An amount of 0.2 g of zeolite material is equilibrated at room temperature for 1 hour with 200<br>
mL of an aqueous solution comprising 1,000 mg/L ammonium, 100 mg/L calcium, 2,000<br>
mg/L potassium and 2,000 mg/L sodium ions. Results on treatment of this solution with<br>
zeolite A, zeolite N and clinoptilolite are shown in Table 10.<br>
The data in Table 10 reveal that zeolite N is characterized by a high loading capacity for<br>
ammonium ions in the presence of calcium, sodium arid potassium ions (a positive value for<br>
loading shows that ions are adsorbed by the material of interest, whereas a negative value<br>
shows that ions are released into the solution by the material of interest). In contrast, zeolite<br>
4A, with a theoretical high loading for ammonium ions, was found to be non-selective towards<br>
ammonium ions in the presence of calcium, sodium and potassium ions. Furthermore, the<br>
data for clinoptilolite is unusual in that calcium and magnesium ion concentration actually<br>
increases when this material is added to the tested aqueous solution. For clinoptilolite, the<br>
CEC value for ammonium ions is considerably lower than the value recorded for zeolite N.<br>
The percentage selectivity for ammonium, for example, is defined as:<br>
% selectivity = (CECNH4+ /CEC(ot of zeolite)x100	(1)<br>
where total CEC|Ot = CEC for calcium + CEC for ammonium + CEC for sodium (+/- CEC for<br>
potassium) and CECNH4+.= CEC for ammonium ion. The choice of sodium or potassium ions<br>
in equation (1) depends upon which of these ions is adsorbed by the material of interest.<br>
Table 10 also shows data for the excess ions in solution. This value is calculated from the<br>
measured concentrations of ions in solution'after the material of interest has been added.<br>
The low value for excess ions in all cases indicates that ion exchange (rather than<br>
precipitation of insoluble phases) occurs under these experimental conditions.<br><br>
36<br>
The values presented in Table 10 clearly show the higher selectivity of zeolite N for<br>
ammonium over alkali metal and alkaline earth ions compared to zeolite 4A and clinoptilolite.<br>
This selectivity is a critical property for commercial application for ammonia concentration<br>
control in ruminant animals.<br>
Example 31:     Use of Zeolite Nasa Component of Pet Utter<br>
The effectiveness of zeolite N for reduction of odours associated with ammonia from cat litter<br>
is evaluated at six professional veterinary practices. Approximately 10 % of conventional cat<br>
fitter is substituted with zeolite N granules and the modified litter is placed in animal cages<br>
following standard procedure at each veterinary practice. Subjective responses from staff<br>
regarding the degree of odour reduction are then compiled. In all cases, zeolite N is<br>
considered to successfully reduce ammonia odours. Animals - specifically cats - are not<br>
detrimentally affected by its use.<br>
Example 32:     Use of Zeolite N in aquaria to maintain low ammonium concentrations<br>
Zeolite N is applied to separate aquaria (fresh or saline water) for ten different fish species to<br>
reduce ammonium ion accumulation due to natural causes. The zeolite is presented in<br>
several different configurations: either located (i) in an air driven corner filter, (ii) in a nylon<br>
mesh bag in the filter, or (Hi) in a floating nylon mesh bag. Each aquarium contained between<br>
3 and 300 fish, depending on the species. For each aquarium, water ranged between pH 7.0<br>
and 7.2. Zeolite N is held in the aquaria for periods ranging from 12 weeks to 48 weeks<br>
without detrimental impact on the fish. During this time, the ammonium levels in all aquaria<br>
remained below 0.2 mg/L<br>
Example 33: Comparative exchange for copper, zinc, nickel, cobalt, cadmium or lead ion<br>
from an aqueous solution in the presence of calcium Ions.<br>
Zeolite 4A (PQ Corporation) and clinoptilolite (Australian Zeolites) are compared with zeolite<br>
N as disclosed in Examples 1 (a potassium form) and 19 (sodium-potassium form).<br>
Approximately 0.2 g of zeolite material was equilibrated at room temperature for 1 hour with<br>
200 mL of an aqueous solution comprising 50 mg/L of the appropriate metal ion (e.g. copper,<br>
zinc, nickel, cobalt, cadmium or lead) and 200 mg/L calcium ions. The relative cation<br>
loadings for each zeolite on each solution containing a metal ion with calcium ions are given<br>
in Table 11. Percentage selectivity for the specific metal ion is also summarised in Table 11.<br>
Table 11 reveals that, for example, zeolite N is characterized by a high loading capacity for<br>
copper ions in the presence of calcium ions (a positive value for loading shows that ions are<br>
adsorbed by the material of interest, whereas a negative value shows that Ions are released<br><br>
37<br>
into the solution by the material of interest). Similarly, zeolite 4A shows a comparable value<br>
for loading capacity for copper ions. Clinoptilolite is a very poor material for exchange of<br>
copper ions from aqueous solution.<br>
However, the calcium ion uptake for each zeolite varies significantly. Zeolite 4A exchanges<br>
large quantities of calcium ions and clinoptilolite loads fewer calcium ions. For both zeolite A<br>
and clinoptilolite, the calcium ion uptake is approximately twice the amount of ammonium ion<br>
uptake. However, the performance of zeolite N which exhibits the lowest exchange of calcium<br>
ions in the presence of copper ions shows that the material has the highest selectivity for<br>
small-sized metal ions such as copper. Table 11 compares the copper selectivity values for<br>
zeolite N relative to zeolite 4A and clinoptilolite. The data in Table 11 show that zeolite N is<br>
highly selective towards copper ion in the presence of excess amounts of competing calcium<br>
ions in solution.<br>
Similar data are obtained for the zinc/calcium, nickel/calcium, cobalt/calcium,<br>
cadmium/calcium and lead/calcium systems and are shown in Table 11. The values for<br>
cadmium loading onto zeolite N are lower than for copper ion loading, but again, the<br>
selectivity of zeolite N for cadmium ions over calcium ions is high (&gt; 80%) as shown in Table<br>
11. These selectivity values for cadmium are significantly higher than the value for zeolite 4A.<br>
The selectivity value for clinoptilolite - whilst 100% - has little practical value as the loading<br>
capacity is extremely poor (
Table 11 lists data for nickel and shows that zeolite N of Example 1 is lower in loading<br>
capacity than zeolite N of Example 19 but both are significantly higher than zeolite 4A. The<br>
selectivity for nickel ions over calcium ions is significantly higher for zeolite N than for zeolite<br>
4A or clinoptilolite. Similarly, the selectivity of zeolite N for cobalt and lead is higher that the<br>
selectivity determined for zeolite A or clinoptilolite. A summary of the selectivity data for these<br>
metal ions against calcium is shown in Figure 19 for the zeolites used in this example.<br>
Table 11 also shows the excess ions in solution for each metal/alkali ion system. This value<br>
is calculated from the measured concentrations of ions in solution after the material of<br>
interest has been added. The low value for excess ions in all cases indicates that ion<br>
exchange (rather than precipitation of insoluble phases) occurs under these experimental<br>
conditions. While not wishing to be bound by theory, similarly high selectivity for other metal<br>
ions such as silver over calcium Ions is anticipated for zeolite N.<br>
Example 34: Reduced nitrogen leaching with zeolite Nasa soil supplement<br>
A sandy soil is thoroughly mixed with zeolite N (prepared as disclosed in Example 1 at the<br><br>
38<br>
• rate 0,1,2,4 and 8 g/kg. The soil mixtures are packed into columns and treated with water<br>
obtained from a natural underground bore. The leading 20 ml of water treatment is fertilised<br>
with ammonium sulphate fertiliser at the rate of 25 mg N per kg of soil. A flow rate of 10<br>
millilitres per min is maintained through the soil column. Samples of leachate are collected in<br>
10 mL vials and analysed for ammonium and total nitrogen content. Data on analysed<br>
nitrogen in the leachate samples are plotted in Figure 20 for pore volumes treated (i.e.<br>
equivalent to volume flow of bore water).<br>
In Figure 20, the control sample, in which no zeolite N is mixed with the soil column,<br>
demonstrates typical nitrogen leachate rates for sandy soils. For example, within one pore<br>
volume of solution treatment, more than 50% of the available nitrogen is leached from the<br>
column. However, with addition of zeolite N in the soil mixture, nitrogen leaching is reduced<br>
significantly. At one pore volume, less than 5% of the available nitrogen has leached from<br>
the column. At four pore volumes with the lowest zeolite N application rate, less than 10% of<br>
the nitrogen has leached from the column.<br>
Example 35:    Antimicrobial activity of zeolite N<br>
Zeolite N prepared according to the method disclosed in Example 1 is co-exchanged with<br>
zinc, silver and ammonium ion. A co-exchanged version of zeolite A is also prepared for<br>
comparison with zeolite N. Zeolites co-exchanged with silver, zinc and ammonium ions are<br>
prepared as follows: 0.1 kg of zeolite is mixed with 375 mL of an aqueous solution<br>
comprising 0.05 M silver nitrate, 0.454 M zinc nitrate and 0.374 M ammonium nitrate salts.<br>
Following addition of water to make a total volume of 1000 mL of solution, the sample is<br>
stirred and heated at approximately 50°C overnight After filtering and drying at 110°C, the<br>
exchanged zeolite sample contained 2 wt % silver, 11 wt % Zn and 2.5 wt % ammonium.<br>
A bacterial cell suspension of approximately 106 cells is made up in 100 mL of sterile, distilled<br>
water in a sterile flask. 100 mg of antimicrobial zeolite powder is added to the test<br>
suspensions. The control sample is a 100 mL bacterial suspension of ca. 106 cells without<br>
the presence of antimicrobial zeolite material. Three separate strains of bacteria are<br>
prepared for evaluation: ACM 1900 Escherichia coli, ACM 5201 Pseudomonas aeruginosa<br>
and ACM 1901 Staphylococcus aureus. E. coli and P. aeruginosa are common gram<br>
negative strains while S. aureus is gram positive.<br>
The flasks are placed on a shaker at 150 rpm in an incubation room at 28°C under light<br>
conditions. At contact times of 0,4 and 24 h, 1 mL of culture are taken and serial dilution is<br>
performed. The dilutions are plated on spread plates of PYEA in order to determine the<br>
bacterial concentration.   Viable counts of bacteria are performed after the plates are<br><br>
39<br>
incubated at 37°C overnight.<br>
Results of the plate counts for each bacterial strain are listed in Table 12. Plate counts show<br>
that 100% of the three bacterial strains are destroyed at 4 hours contact and at 24 hours<br>
contact for both zeolite N and zeolite A.<br>
Example 36:     Comparative uptake of alkaline earth Ions in the presence of active<br>
antimicrobial ion-exchanged zeolites.<br>
Silver-exchanged zeolite N and zeolite A for comparison are prepared by the following<br>
procedure. 20 g of zeolite is added to a 5 L beaker containing 1.5 L of water. 33.97 g of silver<br>
nitrate is dissolved in 0.5 L of water and then added to the beaker containing the zeolite<br>
slurry. After 2 hours stirring at ambient temperature, the solution is decanted and the zeolite<br>
powder dried at 110°C.<br>
Silver-exchanged zeolites are then contacted with an aqueous solution containing 100 mg/L<br>
calcium ions and 20 mg/L magnesium ions to determine the degree of alkaline earth ion<br>
uptake by the exchanged zeolite. The test solution is made by adding appropriate amounts of<br>
calcium chloride and magnesium sulphate salts to deionized water. 0.2 g of zeolite is then<br>
added to 200 ml_ of the alkaline earth test solution for a period of 1 hour at ambient<br>
temperature. Atomic Adsorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is employed to measure the<br>
concentration of calcium and magnesium ions in solution both before and after contact with<br>
the silver zeolite material. The amount of calcium or magnesium ion exchanged in terms of<br>
millimotes is then calculated from the measured concentrations. The uptake of Ca and Mg<br>
ions (as meq/100g of zeolite) for zeolite N and zeolite A is 47 g/kg and 348 g/kg, respectively.<br>
These CEC values show that Ca and Mg ions are readily exchanged by zeolite A - as<br>
previously described and known in prior art. The low uptake for Ca and Mg ions<br>
demonstrated by zeolite N suggests that silver ion is released to the test solution in a more<br>
controlled manner com pared with zeolite A. Extensive re-use applications of Ag-exchanged<br>
zeolite A may result in loss of antimicrobial activity more rapidly than Ag-exchanged zeolite N.<br>
Example 37: Ammonia gas adsorption using zeolite N<br>
Silver-exchanged zeolite N is prepared by the following procedure: 20 g of zeolite is added to<br>
a 5 L beaker containing 1.5 L of water. 33.97 g of silver nitrate is dissolved in 0.5 L of water<br>
and then added to the beaker containing the zeolite slurry. After 2 hours of stirring at ambient<br>
temperature the solution is decanted and the zeolite dried at 110°C.<br><br>
40<br>
Zinc-exchanged zeolite N is prepared as follows: 500 mL of 0.454M zinc nitrate solution is<br>
mixed with 50 g of zeolite N, stirred and heated at 50°C for a period of 5 hours. After<br>
decanting the solution, a second exchange is performed with fresh zinc nitrate solution.<br>
Finally, the zinc-exchanged zeolite N is washed and dried at 110GC.<br>
Approximately 0.25g samples of silver-exchanged and zinc-exchanged zeolite N (zeolite Ag-<br>
N and zeolite Zn-N) are placed in a temperature-controlled reactor vessel and subjected to<br>
air flows of composition listed in Table 13 using mass-flow controllers. The space velocity<br>
maintained for all experiments is 50,000 hr'1. The reactor vessel is subjected to a controlled<br>
heating and cooling sequence to measure the adsorption of ammonia gas over a fixed period<br>
of two hours at two operating temperatures - 80°C and 120°C. The ammonia gas content on<br>
the adsorbers is measured by distiliative removal of ammonia species. Data for ammonia gas<br>
adsorption at 80°C and 120°C are provided in Table 13.<br>
Example 38: Absorption ofanions from wastewater using zeolite N<br>
Granules of test materials) are loaded into glass columns (<j>~52mm; packed bed height<br>
~750mm) with inlet and outlet openings suited to flow of test solutions and analysis of<br>
samples as noted in Example 25. Wastewater at pH 8.0 produced by an anaerobic digester<br>
side stream circuit in a sewage treatment plant Is introduced into the columns after a sand<br>
filtration step to remove suspended solids. Solutions are pumped at a constant flow rate of 2<br>
bed volumes per hour for each test material. The digester side stream wastewater shows<br>
typical concentrations for Caz+ and Mg2+ (43 mg/L and 13 mg/L, respectively), Na+ and l
(320 mg/L and 230 mg/L, respectively) as well as high levels of ammonium, alkalinity, BOO,<br>
COD and total dissolved solids (1,528 mg/L, 4,500 mg/L, 94 mg/L, 1,300 mg/L and 2,100<br>
mg/L, respectively). The inlet phosphate ion concentration is 265 mg/L.<br>
Data for this exam pie are listed in Table 14 for treatment of the wastewater at 5 bed volumes<br>
and at 50 bed volumes of flow, respectively. Table 14 shows that total phosphorus is reduced<br>
from 230mg/L to 120mg/L and 190mg/L, respectively at 5 bed volumes and 50 bed volumes<br>
of treated wastewater. Under these conditions, which include many competing ions, reduction<br>
of iron, manganese and zinc also occurs as shown in Table 14.<br>
Example 39: Comparative oil absorption<br>
Samples of zeolite N (Examples 1 r 4,7-11,13 and 20) are subjected to a standard linseed oil<br>
absorption test and compared with the following commercially available materials: (a)<br>
Alumina Hydrate (AS303 supplied by Commercial Minerals Ltd.), (b) Activebond 23<br>
Bentonite (supplied by Commercial Minerals Ltd); (c) Zeolite 4A (supplied by PQ<br><br>
41<br>
Corporation), <d trubond mw bentonite by commercial minerals ltd.></d>
Kingaroy kaolin (Kingwhite 65, Unimin Aust.Ry Ltd), (f) attapulgite (Clay Minerals Society<br>
Source Clays: PF1-1 from Gadsen County FL). The results of these standard oil absorption<br>
tests on zeolite N samples from Examples 1,4, 7 to 11,13 and 20 as well as commercially<br>
available materials are shown in Table 15.<br>
Table 15 shows that zeolite N has high oil absorption capacity and significantly higher values<br>
than bentonites and zeolite 4A. Oil absorption capacity for zeolite N is better than that for<br>
zeolite X (for which property this material Is used in detergents) or zeolite A and, is similar to,<br>
or better than that for attapulgite, bentonife, kaolin and alumina hydrate.<br><br>

A process for making  aluminosilicates of zeolite N structure comprising the steps of: (i) combining a water soluble<br>
monovalent cation, a solution of hydroxyl anions and an  aluminosilicate to form a resulant mixture having a  pH greater than 10 and<br>
a H2O/Al2O3  ratio in the range 30 to 220; (ii) heating the resultant mixture to a temperature of between 50oC and  the boiling point of<br>
the mixture for a time between 1 minute and 100 hours until a crystalline product of zeolite N structure is  formed as determined by<br>
X-ray diffraction or other suitable characteristic; and (iii) separating the zeolite N product as a solid  from the mixture. <br></asi></j></j></j></j></td>
