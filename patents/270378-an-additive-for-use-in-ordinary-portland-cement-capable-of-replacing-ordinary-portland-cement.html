FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an additive for use in ordinary portland cement.<br>
The additive of the present invention constitutes a part replacement of<br>
ordinary portland cement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is generally known that ash can be generated from coal, and the ash<br>
normally comprises a hard coal ash. Hard coal ash also consists of two<br>
portions, namely a first portion of lighter particles and taken out in a dry<br>
form through electrostate precipitators. Such a portion is normally the<br>
major portion and may comprise in as much as 80% of the flyash. The<br>
other portion comes from the bottom of the furnace and is referred to as<br>
slag or bottom ash and consists of bigger particles.<br>
Yet another ash known in the art is generated from wood and has<br>
different chemical constituents to that of fly ash generated from furnaces<br>
or boilers.<br>
The ash used in the present invention is flyash from furnaces or boilers.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Fly ash, a by-product of the combustion of pulverized coal was hitherto<br>
considered as a waste material but having excellent pozzolanic<br>
properties. This pozzolanic property of fly ash has been utilized for quite<br>
some time in construction activities such as ready mix concrete.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an additive for use in ordinary<br>
Portland cement.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an additive for use in<br>
ordinary portland cement which provides an increase in strength by 25<br>
to 30% beyond 28 days of curing at low cost.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an additive for use in<br>
ordinary portland cement which lowers the initial curing time and hence<br>
reduces the de-shuttering time<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose an additive for use in<br>
ordinary portland cement which utilizes the waste fly ash of power plant<br>
for a more useful purpose.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose an additive for use in<br>
ordinary portland cement which is efficient.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention be more apparent from<br>
the ensuing description.<br><br>
-4-<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an additive for use in<br>
ordinary portland cement capable of replacing upto 30% of ordinary<br>
Portland cement comprising flyash and at least a plasticizer.<br>
Further, according to this invention there is provided a process for the<br>
preparation of an additive for use in ordinary portland cement and<br>
capable of replacing upto 30% of ordinary portland cement which<br>
comprises in the steps of:<br>
1.) introducing flyash into a blender<br>
2)	adding at least a plasticizer thereto and ensuring a proper blending<br>
3)	said polymer being added in an amount of 0.25 to 0.5% by weight<br>
of fly ash.<br>
In accordance with this invention, a dry powder form of flyash is added<br>
as an admixture to ordinary portland cement in conjunction with a super<br>
plasticizer. If flyash and super platicizer is added separately to ordinary<br>
portland cement, the required results are not achieved. Thus, flyash and<br>
super plasticizer is added in the form of an admixture, which has<br>
synergism.<br><br>
-5-<br>
The flyash is introduced into a blender, such as a ribbon blender, and<br>
the plasticizer is added thereto in incremental doses. The quantity of<br>
each dose is not of importance, as such as introduction in dose form is<br>
only to ensure a proper blending of the plasticizer with flyash. The<br>
admixture contains 0.25 to 0.5% by weight of plasticizer to that of flyash.<br>
The plasticizer comprises a sulphonic based polymer, such as napthaline<br>
sulphonatic based polymer. The admixture may by way of another<br>
embodiment also contains 0 to 0.75 of red oxide by weight of flyash.<br>
The function of red oxide is limited only to impart a colour.<br>
The blending is carried out for a period 30 to 60 minutes. During the<br>
process of blending the temperature rises which is responsible for the<br>
synergism effect of the admixture.<br>
The fly ash used in the additive conforms to IS: 3812-2003 which<br>
underlines the limiting value for some specific parameters such as: Loss<br>
on ignition: 5.0% (Max); Fineness: 3200 cm2/gm (Min.) Lime reactivity:<br>
45Kg/cm2 (Min.) etc.) of fly ash to be used for mixing with Ordinary<br>
Portland Cement (OPC). Laboratory test indicates that when fly ash alone<br>
is mixed with OPC early strength of 3 and 7 days is lower than the<br>
strength of OPC alone. To improve upon the strength of 3 and<br><br>
-6-<br>
7 days chemical admixtures arc to be added in fly ash. For this purpose,<br>
admixtures (super plasticizers) in powder form is developed for making<br>
homogenous mixture with fly ash. Fly ash used is of ASTM class F type.<br>
The studies were conducted on M-25 and M-30 grade concrete cubes of<br>
1) plain OPC 2) plain OPC replaced with 40% fly ash 3) OPC replaced<br>
with varying percentages of developed product. All these cubes were<br>
tested for compressive strength as per India standard. Optimization<br>
study of product mix with OPC were carried out and found that strength<br>
in 3,7,28 and 90 days is increased when 20-30% of OPC is replaced with<br>
product and conforms to be cement standard.<br>
The advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the<br>
various examples as representated in Table 1.<br><br>
-8-<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to<br>
modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such<br>
variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this<br>
invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention,<br>
which is further set forth under the following claims:-<br><br>
