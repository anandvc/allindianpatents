DIONE, L(+) TARTRATE SALT OR A SOLVATE THEREOF AND<br>
ITS METHOD OF PREPARATION".<br>
SMITHKLINE BEECHAM P.L.C., a British company, of 980 Great West Road, Brentford, Middlesex TW8 9GS, United Kingdom,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to compound 5-[4-[2-(n-methyl-n-(2-pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl] thiazolidine-2,4-dione, 1(+) tartrate salt or a solvate thereof and its method of preparation.<br>
This invention relates to a novel pharmaceutical, to a process for the preparation of the pharmaceutical and to the use of the pharmaceutical in medicine.<br>
European Patent Application, Publication Number 0,306,228 relates to certain thiazolidinedione derivatives disclosed as having hypoglycaemic and hypohpidaemic activity. The compound of example 30 of EP 0,306,228 is 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)amino)emoxy]benzyl]thiazohdine-2,4-dione (hereinafter also referred to as "Compound (I)").<br>
International Patent Application, Publication Number WO94/05659 discloses certain salts of the compounds of EP 0,306,228 one of which is the tartrate salt. The preferred salt of WO94/05659 is the maleic acid salt.       ;'<br>
It has now been discovered that Compound (I) forms a novel tartrate salt (hereinafter also referred to as the "L(+) Tartrate") that is particu, arly stable and hence is suitable for bulk preparation and handling. The L(+) Tartrate also has a high melting point and possesses good bulk flow properties. The L(+) Tartrate is therefore surprisingly amenable to large scale pharmaceutical processing and especially to large scale milling.<br>
The novel form can be prepared by an efficient, economic and reproducible process particularly suited to large-scale preparation.<br>
The novgliartrate also has useful pharmacy uncial properties and in particular it is  _ indicated to be useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diabetes mellitus, conditions associated with diabetes mellitus and certain complications thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-pyridyl)atnino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione, L(+) tartrate salt or a solvate thereof.<br>
Suitably, the L(+) Tartrate is a mono-tartrate salt.<br>

(iii) an X-Ray powder diffraction pattern (XRPD) substantially in accordance with Table 1 or Figure 3; and (iv) a Solid State 13C NMR spectrum substantially in accordance, with Figure 4.<br>
The present invention encompasses the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof isolated in pure form or when admixed with other materials. Thus in one aspect there is provided the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof in isolated form.<br>
In a further aspect there is provided the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a purified form.<br>
In yet a further aspect there is provided the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof in crystalline form.<br>
Also, the invention provides the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a solid pharmaceutically acceptable form, such as a solid dosage form, especially when adapted for oral administration.<br>
Moreover, the invention also provides the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, especially in bulk form, such form being particularly thereof in a milled form.<br>
Furthermore, the invention provides the L(+) Tartrate or solvate thereof in a pharmaceutically acceptable form, especially in bulk form, such form having good flow properties, especially good bulk flow properties. A suitable solvate is a hydrate.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing the L(+) Tartrate or a solvate thereof, characterised in that 5-[4-[2-(N-methyl-N-(2-<br>
pyridyl)amino)ethoxy]benzyl]thiazolidine-2,4-dione (Compound (I)) or a salt thereof, preferably dispersed or dissolved in a suitable solvent, is reacted with a source of L(+) tartrate ion and thereafter, if required, a solvate of the resulting L(+) Tartrate is prepared; and the L(+) Tartrate or a solvate thereof is recovered.<br>
A suitable reaction solvent is an alkanol, for example propan-2-ol, or a hydrocarbon, such as toluene, a ketone, such as acetone, an ester, such as ethyl acetate, an ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a nitrile such as acetonitrile, or ahalogenated hydrocarbon<br>
2<br><br>
WO 02/12231<br><br>
PCT/GB 01/03506<br><br>
such as dichloromethane or water, or an organic acid such as acetic acid; or a mixture thereof.<br>
Conveniently, the source of L(+) tartrate ion is L(+) tartaric acid. The L(+) tartaric acid is preferably added as a solid or in solution, for example in water or a lower alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, or propan-2-ol, or a mixture of solvents. An alternative source of L(+) tartrate ion is provided by a suitably soluble base salt of L(+) tartaric acid for example ammonium L(+) tartrate, or the L(+) tartaric acid salt of an amine, for example ethylamine or diethylamine.<br>
The concentration of Compound (I) is preferably in the range 2 to 25% weight/volume, more preferably in the range 5 to 20%. The concentration of tartaric acid solutions are preferably in the range of 5 to 130% weight/volume.<br>
The reaction is usually carried out at ambient temperature or at an elevated temperature, for example at the reflux temperature of the solvent, although any convenient temperature that provides the required product may be employed.<br>
Solvates, such as hydrates, of the L(+) Tartrate are prepared according to conventional procedures.<br>
Recovery of the required compound generally comprises crystallisation from an appropriate solvent, conveniently the reaction solvent, usually assisted by cooling. For example, the L(+) tartrate may be crystallised from an alcohol such as ethanol or propan-2-ol or a nitrile such as acetonitrile or a mixture thereof.   An improved yleld of the salt may be obtained by evaporation of some or all of the solvent or by crystallisation at elevated temperature followed by controlled cooling, preferably in stages. Careful control nf precipitation temperature may be used to improve, the reproducibility of the product form.<br>
Crystallisation can also be initiated by seeding with crystals of the L(+) Tartrate or a solvate thereof but this is not essential.<br>
When the mono tartrate salt comprises another monovalent salting ion such as an alkali metal or ammonium cation the said ion is conveniently formed by reacting the mono tartrate salt with a solution of the chosen monovalent salting ion for example a metal or ammonium ion. Alternatively Compound (T) may be treated with a mono tartrate salt of the said monovalent salting ion.<br>
Compound (I) is prepared according to known procedures, such as those disclosed in EP 0,306,228 and WO94/05659. The disclosures of EP 0,306,228 and WO94/05659 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>

The solid-state NMR spectrum of the product (Figure 4) was recorded on a Bruker AMX360 instrument operating at 90.55 MHz: The solid was packed into a 4 mm zirconia MAS rotor fitted with a Kel-F cap and rotor spun at ca.10 kHz.  The I3C MAS spectrum was acquired by cross-polarisation from Hartmarm-Hahn matched protons (CP contact time 3ms, repetition time 15 s) and protons were decoupled during acquisition using a two-pulse phase modulated (TPPM) composite sequence.  Chemical shifts were externally referenced to the carboxylate signal of glycine at 176.4 ppm relative to TMS and were observed at: 181.0, 179, 177.2, 174.7, 173.0, 158.2, 150.3, 144.7, 141.6, 139.2, 136.1, 131.7, 118.1, 113.8, 111, 110, 74.6, 73.7, 73.0, 64.6, 55.8, 50.7, 40.5, 38.7, 36.7, 34.9 ppm.<br>
Properties of the L(+) tartrate, recorded for the product of Example 4<br>
Solid State Stability of the L(+) Tartrate<br>
The solid state stability of the drug substance was determined by storing approximately<br>
1.0 g of the material in a glass bottle at i) 40°C / 75 % Relative Humidity (RH), open<br>
exposure, for 1 month and b) at 50°C, closed, for 1 month. The material was assayed by HPLC for final content and degradation products in both cases.<br>
a)	40°C / 75 % RH: No significant degradation observed (HPLC assay 97% initial).<br>
b)	50°C:	No significant degradation observed (HPLC assay 98_% initial)<br>
Flow Properties of the L(+) Tartrate:<br>
The ratio between the bulk density and the tapped bulk density (Hausner Ratio) of the<br>
L(+) Tartrate was determined using standard methods ("Pharmaceutics - The Science<br>
of Dosage Form Design", editor M. Aulton, 1988, published by:Churchill<br>
Livingstone).<br>
Hausner Ratio: 1.2<br>
Melting Point of the L(+) Tartrate<br>
The melting point of the L(+) Tartrate was determined according to the method described in<br>
the U.S. Pharmacopoeia, USP 23, 1995,  "Melting range or temperature, Procedure<br>
for Class la", using a Buchi 545 melting point instrument.<br>
Melting Point: 182.1 °C<br>
Tonset of the L(+) Tartrate<br>
The Tonset of the drug substance was determined by Differential Scanning Calorimetry<br>
using a Perkin-Elmer DSC7 apparatus.<br>
