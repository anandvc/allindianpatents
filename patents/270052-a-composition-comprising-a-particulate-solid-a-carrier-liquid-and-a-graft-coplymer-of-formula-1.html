				<td>GRAFT COPOLYMER AND COMPOSITION THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]      The invention relates to a graft copolymer with a polyester side chain and at least one quaternised tertiary amine group.  The tertiary amine may be aliphatic, aromatic or heterocyclic. The invention further relates to the use of the compound as a dispersant, particularly for pigments.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
[0002] Many coating properties often generically referred to as tinctorial properties (including, for example, colour intensity, opacity and gloss) depend upon the extent of aggregation or flocculation of pigment particles (or other particulate materials) within the coating. Colour is normally introduced into a coating formulation by addition of a pigment dispersion in solvent containing a high concentration of pigment.<br>
[0003] The pigment dispersion is generally produced by one of a variety of milling techniques to break up the aggregates of pigment particles and reduce the average particle size. Milling is often carried out in the presence of some polymeric material which is present to stabilise the dispersion and minimize flocculation of the dispersed particles. However, some pigment dispersions disperse poorly in solvent based systems.<br>
[0004] European Patent 0 458 479 discloses a coating composition containing a dispersant and a graft copolymer of an acrylic polymer component having a tertiary amino group and/or a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring and a particular polyester component.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent 5,319,045 (and JP 4-161415 A) discloses ester-type copolymers useful for resin modifiers.<br>
[0006] U.S. Patent 6,362,274 discloses graft copolymers containing at least three sequences of distinct chemical nature. The three sequences include an anchoring group, a hydrophilic group, and a hydrophobic group. The graft copolymers are useful for preparing pigment dispersions in aqueous and/or organic media.<br>
[0007] International Patent Application WO 01/44330 discloses a composition suitable for a pigment dispersant, which contains a graft copolymer having a macromonomer grafted onto the polymeric backbone. The graft copolymer contains an amide functional group as a pigment anchoring group. The backbone may also have attached to the backbone an additional pigment anchoring group selected from an aromatic ester, an aromatic amine, an aliphatic amine, a quaternary ammonium group, or mixtures thereof.<br>
[0008] European Patent application EP 1 182 218 Al and U.S. Patent Application 2003/00225207, both disclose graft copolymers for pigment dispersants.<br>
[0009] Examples of pigment types that are known to disperse poorly in solvent based systems include perylene-based pigments, anthraquinone-based pigments or quinacridone-based pigments. Attempts to disperse these pigments in solvent based systems include utilising caprolactone:polyethylene imine copolymer dispersants (EP 632 108 A), Novolak resin dispersants (JP 09291249 A), alkylene oxide based graft copolymer dispersants (disclosed in both JP 10046050 A and JP 10060360 A), and specific acrylic graft copolymers that interact with carbon black (JP 2004091610 A). [0010] However, it is believed that none of the dispersants provide good tinctorial properties (including at least one of acceptable dispersancy, acceptable transparency, acceptable viscosity, and acceptable shock seeding) in a final coating. Thus, there is a need to disperse a pigment in solvent based systems that is capable of providing acceptable properties to a coating. The present invention provides a composition capable of dispersing a pigment in a solvent based system.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0011]      In one embodiment, the invention provides a composition comprising a particulate solid, a carrier liquid and a graft copolymer of Formula (1):<br>

Examples of the moiety A are represented by the Formulae<br>
(2)	to (9):<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein<br>
R.2 is independently an alkylene group that may be linear or branched having a carbon number of 1-25;<br>
R3 and R4 are independently linear or branched alkyl groups having carbon number of 1-4 (typically R3 and R4 are the same);<br>

Z is a core residue of any diisocyanate compound i.e., Z can be considered to be the residue of the diisocyanate compound minus the two (NCO) isocyanate groups.  Formula (8) illustrates this.<br>
[0028] Moiety A of Formula (1) may be quaternised before or after polymeR1sation. Typically, moiety A is quaternised after the graft copolymer has been synthesised.<br>
[0029] In one embodiment, the graft copolymer is a (meth)acrylic graft<br>
copolymer. Typically, the (meth)acrylic graft copolymer may be deR1ved from a<br>
dialkylaminoalkyl (meth) acrylate, or mixtures thereof. Examples of a suitable<br>
dialkylaminoalkyl (meth)acrylate include dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,<br>

Particularly useful quaternising agents for the graft copolymer of Formula (1) include benzyl chloR1de, dimethyl sulphate, propylene oxide, or styrene oxide. Often epoxides are used in the presence of equal molar quantity of acid (such as acetic acid). [0031] The degree of quaternising may be from greater than 1%, or greater than 10%, or greater than 20% and or 40% or more of the amine moieties. The degree of<br>
quaternising may be as high as 100%, or 95% or 90% of the amine moieties. In different embodiments, the degree of quaternising ranges from greater than 1 % to 100%, or greater than 10% to 95%, or greater than 20% to 95%, or 40% to 90%. [0032] B is a moiety which contains at least one polymer chain compR1sing of a polyester Yi or Y2 with a number average molecular weight of at least 200. The number average molecular weight may also be in the range of 300 to 5000, or 500 to 3000, or 1000 to 2500.<br>
[0033] In one embodiment, Moiety B compR1ses of a polyester chain deR1ved from a lactone or a hydroxycarboxylic acid, or mixtures thereof by at least one of the following Formulae (10)-(17):<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
[0034]      In one embodiment, Yi is represented by at least one of the Formulae: (FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
[0035]      In one embodiment, Y2 is represented by at least one of the Formulae:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein for Formulae (10) to (23)<br>

Yi or Y2 may be obtained/obtainable from a lactone or hydroxy carboxylic acid, typically containing 1 to 26 carbon atoms.<br>
[0036] Examples of suitable lactones include (3-propiolactone and optionally Ci-6-alkyl substituted 5-valerolactone and e-caprolactone such as P-methyl-8-valerolactone, 8-valerolactone, e-caprolactone, 2-methyl-e-caprolactone, 3-methyl-e-caprolactone, 4-methyl-e-caprolactone, 5-tert butyl-e-caprolactone, 7-methyl-e-caprolactone, 4,4,6-e-caprolactone tR1methyl-e-caprolactone 4,6,6-tR1methyl-e-caprolactone, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, B is a moiety that contains at least one polyester chain deR1vable from 8-valerolactone and e-caprolactone. [0037] The hydroxy carboxylic acid may be saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched. Examples of suitable hydroxy carboxylic acids are glycolic acid, lactic acid, 5-hydroxy valeR1c acid, 6-hydroxy caproic acid, R1cinoleic acid, 12-hydroxy steaR1c acid, 12-hydroxydodecanoic acid, 5-hydroxy dodecanoic acid, 5-hydroxydecanoic acid 4-hydroxydecanoic acid, or mixtures thereof [0038] C is any non-functional moiety, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment non-functional with respect to the C moiety means that the atoms of that moiety are generally carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in structures unlikely to be involved in chemical condensation reactions involved in polymer chain extension of polymer functionalization. Examples of moieties that compR1se of component C are aliphatic or aromatic esters (e.g. of carboxylic acids) and/or aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbons. Examples of suitable non-functional moiety may be represented by Formulae (24)-(33).<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein<br>
R.2, R3, R4 are as previously descR1bed; and<br>
R5 represents H,-CH3 or alkyl groups typically having 1 to 20 carbon atoms, and the alkyl groups may be linear or branched (typically linear). [0039] In different embodiments, the non-functional moiety may be represented by phenyl moieties of Formula (24), phenyl esters Formula (27) and alkyl moieties Formula (28) (e.g., a butyl acrylate or 2-ethylhexyl acrylate). In one embodiment, the phenyl moieties of Formula (21) where R5 = H are useful. [0040] In one embodiment, the moiety M (including the definitions of R1 and C) may be styrene.<br>
[0041] D is any functional or polar moiety or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the functional groups of the D moiety compR1se groups that react in condensation type reactions common to polymeR1zation reactions. Examples of moieties that compR1se component D include any alcohol group, acid group, epoxide group, isocyanate group, ketone group, aldehyde group, P-diketoester group, acid chloR1de group, acetate group, nitR1le group, ester group, vinyl group, acetyl group, or lactam group. Examples of suitable moieties for D may be represented by Formulae (34) to (51).<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein R1 and R2 are as previously descR1bed.<br>
[0042]      In one embodiment, D includes an alcohol or acid functional moiety. Typically, D is a hydroxyl functional moiety. Grafting<br>
[0043] In one embodiment, the graft copolymer may be produced by polymeR1sing together monomers (e.g., ethylenically unsaturated) represented by Formulae (a), (b), (c), and (d), wherein a portion of the tertiary amine moiety-containing monomer represented by Formula (a) is quaternised.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein R1, A, B, C, and D are the same as defined above.<br>
[0044] One method used for generating the graft copolymer is to polymeR1se monomer (a) and (b), optionally in the presence of (c) and/or (d). In one embodiment, the amount of (c) and (d) combined is less than 10 wt.%, more desirably less than 5 wt.% and preferably less than 1 wt.% of the resulting graft copolymer of Formula 1.   In other embodiments, (c) and (d) are present in more<br>
significant amounts. The tertiary amine moiety of monomer (a) is then quaternised with a quaternising agent. Examples of suitable tertiary amine monomer (a) include dialkylaminoakyl (meth)acrylates. Particularly useful tertiary amine monomers include dimethylaminoethyl acrylate and dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate. [0045] The macromonomer (b) may typically be prepared before copolymeR1sation with (a) and optionally (c) and/or (d). One example is the reaction of a hydroxyl functional polyester with a compound compR1sing of a vinyl group and an isocyanate group is shown in the following reaction scheme:<br>
(SCHEME REMOVED)<br>
wherein R1, R2 R5, and P are defined above.<br>
[0046] Alternatively, a polyester based macromonomer may be synthesised by polymeR1sing a lactone or a mixture of lactones using a hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate as shown in the following reaction scheme for a single lactone.<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
wherein R1, R2 and P are defined above.<br>
[0047] The consequence of this reaction is that the polymer chain end typically contains a hydroxyl group. In such a reaction scheme, the ratio of hydroxyl functional moiety to lactone determines the molecular weight of the product. [0048] In the reaction scheme shown in above, the number average molecular weight of the product may be typically less than 20,000, or less than 10,000, or less than 5000. In one embodiment, the reaction utilises a tin chloR1de catalyst. [0049] Another method for generating the graft copolymer is to copolymeR1se (d) or mixtures of (d) with (a), and (b) and optionally (c). A polyester chain is then introduced that has one chain end reactive to (d). A proportion of (d) from 1-99% may remain unreacted, although 100% of (d) typically reacts. The resulting polymer is then quaternised. In one embodiment, an unsaturated isocyanate is polymeR1sed with a tertiary amine functional monomer. The resulting isocyanate functional copolymer is then reacted with a hydroxyl functional polyester chain. [0050] For example, isopropenyl-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate (commercially available from Cytec under the trademark TMI®) is copolymeR1sed with dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate (and optionally a monomer that meets the definition of (c) and/or (d), e.g., butyl (meth)acrylate) to form an isocyanate functional polymer. This polymer is then reacted with one or more hydroxyfunctional polyesters to form a graft copolymer. Up to 100% of the tertiary amine groups on the graft copolymer may then be quaternised with benzyl chloR1de or dimethyl sulphate.<br>
[0051] In another example, isopropenyl-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate (commercially available from Cytec under the trademark TMI®) is copolymeR1sed with dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate to form an isocyanate functional polymer. This polymer is then reacted with one or more hydroxyfunctional polyesters to form a graft copolymer. Up to 100% of the tertiary amine groups on the graft copolymer may then be quaternised with benzyl chloR1de or dimethyl sulphate.<br>
[0052] In another example, isopropenyl-dimethylbenzyl isocyanate is copolymeR1sed with dimethylaminoethyl (meth)acrylate and styrene to form an isocyanate functional polymer. This polymer is then reacted with one or more hydroxyfunctional polyesters to form a graft copolymer. Up to 100% of the tertiary amine groups on the graft copolymer may then be quaternised with benzyl chloR1de or dimethyl sulphate. [0053] The graft copolymer may be synthesised by any known polymeR1sation technique or a combination of polymeR1sation techniques using a bulk, solution, suspension or emulsion process. The polymeR1sation may compR1se of a radical, anionic, cationic, atom transfer or group transfer polymeR1sation process or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the graft copolymer is polymeR1sed by a free radical polymeR1sation in the presence of a chain transfer agent. Examples of a free radical chain transfer agent include catalytic cobalt chain transfer agents or mercaptans. Mercaptans are particularly useful. In another embodiment, the graft copolymer is polymeR1sed by a free radical polymeR1sation in the presence of a RAFT agent (a reversible addition, fragmentation chain transfer agent). [0054] Examples of mercaptans include 2-mercaptoethanol, 3-mercaptopropanol, thiopropyleneglycol, thioglyceR1ne, thioglycolic acid, thiohydracrylic acid, thiolactic acid and thiomalic acid, isooctyl thioglycolate, n-butyl 3-mercaptopropionate, n-butyl thioglycolate, glycol dimercaptoacetate, tR1methylolpropane tR1thioglycolate, or mixtures thereof. If the polymeR1sation is performed in solvent preferred examples of mercaptans include isooctyl thioglycolate, n-butyl 3-mercaptopropionate, n-butyl thioglycolate, glycol dimercaptoacetate, tR1methylolpropane tR1thioglycolate, or mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the mercaptan is butyl 3-mercaptopropionate.<br>
[0055] Examples of a RAFT chain transfer agent include benzyl<br>

[0056] PolymeR1sation in the presence of RAFT chain transfer agents is descR1bed in more detail in the Handbook of Radical PolymeR1zation, edited by Krzysztof Matyjaszewski and Thomas P. Davis, 2002, Chapter 12, pages 629 to<br>
690, published by John Wiley and Sons Inc. (hereinafter referred to as "Matyjaszewski et al."). A discussion of the polymer mechanism of RAFT polymeR1sation is shown on page 664 to 665 in Section 12.4.4 of Matyjaszewski et al.<br>
[0057] If a solvent is used in the polymeR1sation process, suitable solvents include alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, butanol, butoxyethanol; ketones, such as acetone, butanone, pentanone, hexanone and methyl ethyl ketone; alkyl esters of acetic, propionic and butyR1c acids, such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, amyl acetate, methoxy propyl acetate; ethers, such as tetrahydrofuran, diethyl ether, and ethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol monoalkyl and dialkyl ethers such as cellusolves and carbitols; and, glycols such as ethylene glycol and propylene glycol; and mixtures thereof. Esters and/or ketones and mixtures of esters and/or ketones with alcohols are particularly useful. In one embodiment, butyl acetate and methoxypropyl acetate and mixtures of butyl acetate or methoxypropyl acetate with alcohols are used as the solvent. [0058] PolymeR1sation may be carR1ed out at any suitable temperature for the solvent selected. Typically, polymeR1sation may be carR1ed out in the presence of solvent at a temperature in the range of 50°C to 150°C, or 60°C to 120°C. [0059] Any polymeR1sation initiator may be used. In one embodiment, the polymeR1sation initiator is any free radical polymeR1sation initiator; and the choice of initiator will be influenced by the polymeR1sation temperature and polymeR1sation process. The polymeR1sation initiators used in this process are known in the art and are selected from the conventional free radical initiators such as organic peroxides and azo compounds. The particular free radical initiator employed will depend upon the monomeR1c mateR1al(s) being polymeR1sed and the process conditions. Typically, the amount of initiator may be in the range of 0.005 parts by weight to 5.00 parts by weight, based on 100 parts by weight of the monomer. However, 0.01 parts by weight to 2.00 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of monomer(s) is particularly useful.<br>
[0060] Examples of suitable peroxide initiators include diacyl peroxides, dialkylperoxydicarbonates,       t-alkyl       peroxyesters,       monoperoxycarbonates,<br>
diperoxyketals, diaklyperoxides, t-alkyl hydroperoxides, ketone peroxide. Examples<br>
of diacyl peroxides are dibenzoyl peroxide, di(2,4-dichlorobenzoyl) peroxide,<br>
diacetyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, didecanoyl peroxide, diisononanoyl peroxide,<br>
succinic acid peroxide. Examples of suitable azo initiators include 2,2'-azobis(4-<br>
methoxy-2,4-dimethylvaleronitR1le), 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethyl-valeronitR1le, 2,2'-<br>
azobisisobutyronitR1le, dimethyl 2,2'-azobisisobutyrate, 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl-<br>
butyronitR1le),	l,r-azobis(l-cyclohexanecarbonitR1le),	2-(carbamoylazo)-<br>
isobutyronitR1le, 2,2'-azobis(2,4,4-tR1methyl-pentane.<br>
[0061] The polymeR1sation temperature depends on the type of initiator used. In one embodiment, the initiator is selected so that polymeR1sation may be performed at a temperature of 50°C and 100°C, or between 60°C and 90°C. Typically, the initiators for use in the current invention include lauroyl peroxide, benzoyl peroxide, l,l'-azobis(l-cyclohexanecarbomtR1le), or 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitR1le.

[0063]      The graft copolymer of Formula (1) in different embodiments is present in the composition of the invention in a range selected from 0.1 wt. % to 50 wt. %, or 0.25 wt. % to 35 wt. %, and 0.5 wt. % to 15 wt. % of the composition. [0064]      The particulate solid present in the composition may be any inorganic or organic solid mateR1al which is substantially insoluble in the carR1er liquid e.g., an organic medium. In one embodiment, the particulate solid is a pigment. [0065]      In one embodiment, the composition of the invention provides a paint or ink including a particulate solid, a carR1er liquid (may be an organic medium, or aqueous medium), a binder and a graft copolymer of Formula (1), or salts thereof. [0066]      In one embodiment, the solid is an organic pigment from any of the recognised classes of pigments descR1bed, for example, in the Third Edition of the Colour Index (1971) and subsequent revisions of, and supplements thereto, under the chapter headed "Pigments".

[0070] In one embodiment, the pigment includes perylene-based pigments, quinacR1done-based pigments or anthraquinone-based pigments. [0071] Perylene-based pigments include Pigment Black 32 (CAS No. 83524-75-8), Pigment Black 31 (CAS No. 67075-37-0), Pigment Red-Violet Perylene (CAS No. 51731-80-7), Pigment Red 123 (CAS No. 24108-89-2), Pigment Red 190 (CAS No. 6424-77-7), Pigment Red 179 (CAS No. 5521-31-3), Pigment Red 149 (CAS No. 4948-15-6), Pigment Red 178 (CAS No. 3049-71-6), Pigment Red 189 (CAS No. 2379-77-3), Pigment Red 224 (CAS No. 128-69-8), Pigment Green 47 (CAS No. 128-58-5), Pigment Blue 65 (CAS No. 116-71-2), and Pigment Violet 29 (CAS No. 81-33-4). Typically, perylene-based pigments include Pigment Red 149, Pigment Red 178 or Pigment Red 179.<br>

[0074] The organic medium present in the composition of the invention in one embodiment is a plastics mateR1al and in another embodiment an organic medium. The organic medium may be a non-polar or a polar organic medium, although a polar organic medium is typically used. By the term "polar" in relation to the organic medium, it is meant that an organic medium is capable of forming moderate to strong bonds as descR1bed in the article entitled "A Three Dimensional Approach to Solubility" by Crowley et al. in Journal of Paint Technology, Vol. 38, 1966, at page 269. Such organic medium generally have a hydrogen bonding number of 5 or more as defined in the above mentioned article.<br>
[0075] Examples of suitable polar organic medium are amines, ethers, especially lower alkyl ethers, organic acids, esters, ketones, glycols, alcohols and amides. Numerous specific examples of such moderately strongly hydrogen bonding liquids are given in the book entitled "Compatibility and Solubility" by Ibert Mellan (published in 1968 by Noyes Development Corporation) in Table 2.14 on pages 39-40 and these liquids all fall within the scope of the term polar organic medium as used herein.<br>
[0076] In one embodiment, polar organic medium include dialkyl ketones, alkyl esters of alkane carboxylic acids and alkanols, especially such liquids containing up to, and including, a total of 6 or 8 carbon atoms. As examples of the polar organic medium include dialkyl and cycloalkyl ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, di-isopropyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, di-isobutyl ketone, methyl isoamyl ketone, methyl n-amyl ketone and cyclohexanone; alkyl esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl formate, methyl propionate, methoxy propylacetate and ethyl butyrate; glycols and glycol esters and ethers, such as ethylene glycol, 2-ethoxyethanol, 3-methoxypropylpropanol, 3-ethoxypropylpropanol, 2-butoxyethyl acetate, 3-methoxypropyl acetate, 3-ethoxypropyl acetate and 2-ethoxyethyl acetate; alkanols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol and isobutanol and dialkyl and cyclic ethers such as diethyl ether and tetrahydrofuran. In one embodiment, solvents are alkanols, alkane carboxylic acids and esters of alkane carboxylic acids.<br>
[0077] Examples of the organic medium, which may be used as polar organic medium are film-forming resins such as inks, paints and chips for use in vaR1ous applications such as paints and inks. Examples of such resins include polyamides, such as Versamid™ and Wolfamid™, and cellulose ethers, such as ethyl cellulose and ethyl hydroxyethyl cellulose, nitrocellulose and cellulose acetate butyrate resins, including mixtures thereof. Examples of paint resins include short oil alkyd/melamine-formaldehyde, polyester/melamine-formaldehyde, thermosetting acrylic/melamine-formaldehyde, long oil alkyd, polyether polyols and multi-media resins such as acrylic and urea/aldehyde.<br>
[0078] The organic medium may be a polyol, that is to say, an organic medium with two or more hydroxy groups. In one embodiment, polyols include alpha-omega diols or alpha-omega diol polyoxyethylenes (or polyethylene oxides). [0079] In one embodiment, non-polar organic medium includes compounds containing aliphatic groups, aromatic groups or mixtures thereof. The non-polar organic medium include non-halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene and xylene), halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene,<br>
chlorotoluene), non-halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., linear and branched aliphatic hydrocarbons containing six or more carbon atoms both fully and partially saturated), halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., dichloromethane, carbon tetrachloR1de, chloroform, tR1chloroethane) and natural non-polar organics (e.g., vegetable oil, sunflower oil, linseed oil, terpenes and glyceR1des). [0080] In one embodiment, the organic medium includes at least 0.1% by weight, or 1% by weight or more of a polar organic medium based on the total organic medium.<br>
[0081] The organic medium optionally further includes water. In one embodiment, the organic medium is free of water.<br>
[0082] When the organic medium contains water the amount present in one embodiment is not greater than 70%, or not greater than 50%, or not greater than 40% by weight of the organic medium.<br>
[0083] The resin may also be an unsaturated polyester resin including the so-called sheet moulding compounds and bulk moulding compounds which may be formulated with reinforcing fibres and fillers. Such moulding compounds are descR1bed in DE 3,643,007 and the monograph by P F Bruins entitled "Unsaturated Polyester Technology", Gordon and Breach Science publishers, 1976, pages 211 to 238.<br>
[0084] If desired, the dispersions may contain other ingredients, for example, resins (where these do not already constitute the organic medium) binders, fluidising agents (such as those descR1bed in GB-A-1508576 and GB-A-2108143), anti-sedimentation agents, plasticisers, levelling agents and preservatives. [0085] The composition typically contains 2.5 to 95% by weight of the particulate solid, the precise quantity depending on the nature of the solid and the relative densities of the solid and the organic medium. For example, a composition in which the solid is an organic mateR1al, such as an organic pigment, typically contains 5% to 40% by weight of the solid whereas a composition in which the solid is an inorganic mateR1al, such as an inorganic pigment, filler or extender, typically contains 40% to 90% by weight of the total of composition.<br>
[0086] In one embodiment, the composition is prepared by milling the particulate solid in the organic medium at a temperature which is not greater than 40°C, or not greater than 30°C. However, when the solid is a crude phthalocyanine pigment such as copper phthalocyanine, it is sometimes useful to carry out the milling in an organic liquid at a temperature between 50 and 150°C since greener and bR1ghter shades may be obtained. This is particularly the case where the organic liquid is a high boiling aliphatic and/or aromatic distillate. [0087] The composition may be obtained by any of the conventional methods known for prepaR1ng dispersions. Thus, the solid, the organic medium and the graft copolymer of Formula (1) may be mixed in any order, the mixture then being subjected to a mechanical treatment to reduce the particles of the solid to an appropR1ate size, for example by ball milling, bead milling, gravel milling or plastic milling until the dispersion is formed. Alternatively, the solid may be treated to reduce its particle size independently or in admixture with either, the organic medium or the graft copolymer of Formula (1), the other ingredient or ingredients then being added and the mixture being agitated to provide the dispersion. [0088] If the composition is required in dry form, the liquid medium is typically volatile so that it may be readily removed from the particulate solid by a simple separation means such as evaporation. In one particularly useful composition, the composition compR1ses the liquid medium.<br>
[0089] If the dry composition contains the graft copolymer of Formula (1) and the particulate solid, it may contain at least 0.2%, or at least 0.5%, or at least 1.0% of the graft copolymer of Formula (1) based on weight of the dry composition. In different embodiment, the dry composition contains not greater than 100%, or not greater than 50%, or not greater than 20%, or not greater than 10% by weight based on the weight of the particulate solid.<br>
[0090] As descR1bed hereinbefore, the compositions are particularly suitable for prepaR1ng mill-bases where the particulate solid is milled in a liquid carR1er in the presence of both a particulate solid and a film-forming resin binder.<br>
[0091]      Thus, according to a still further aspect of the invention there is provided<br>
a mill-base compR1sing a particulate solid, the graft copolymer of Formula (1) and a<br>
film-forming resin.<br>
[0092]      Typically, the mill-base contains from 5% to 70% or 10% to 50% by<br>
weight particulate solid based on the total weight of the mill-base.<br>
[0093]      The amount of resin in the mill-base can vary over wide limits but is<br>
typically not less than 10%, or not less than 15% by weight of the continuous/liquid<br>
phase of the mill-base. In different embodiments, the amount of resin is not greater<br>
than 50% or not greater than 40% by weight of the continuous/liquid phase of the<br>
mill-base.<br>
[0094]      The amount of the graft copolymer of Formula (1) in the mill-base is<br>
dependent on the amount of particulate solid but is may be a range of 0.1% to 10%,<br>
or 0.5% to 7.5% by weight of the mill-base.<br>
[0095]      Binders   are   polymeR1c   mateR1als   including   natural   and   synthetic<br>
mateR1als.   In one embodiment, binders include poly(meth)acrylates, polystyrenics,<br>
polyesters, polyurethanes, alkyds, polysacchaR1des such as cellulose, or natural<br>
proteins (such as casein).   In different embodiments, the binder may be present in<br>
the composition at more than 50%, at more than 100%, or more than 200%, or more<br>
than 300%, or more than 400% based on the amount of particulate solid.<br>
[0096]      The amount of optional binder in the mill-base can vary over wide limits<br>
but is typically not less than 10%, and often not less than 20% by weight of the<br>
continuous/liquid phase of the mill-base. In one embodiment, the amount of binder<br>
is not greater than 50% or not greater than 40% by weight of the continuous/liquid<br>
phase of the mill-base.<br>
[0097]      In one embodiment, the composition of the invention further includes<br>
one or more additional known dispersants.<br>
[0098]      The following examples provide illustrations of the invention.   These<br>
examples are non exhaustive and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
