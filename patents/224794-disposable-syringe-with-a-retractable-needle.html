				<td>DISPOSABLE SYRINGE WITH A RETRACTABLE NEEDLE<br>
This invention relates to a disposable syringe, more<br>
particularly toadisposable syringe with a friction diminishing<br>
means to facilitate retraction of a needle into a barrel for<br>
safe disposal.<br>
Conventional syringes, especially those with a sharp needle,<br>
have to be disposed safely after injection. Although a tip<br>
protector is used to shield the needle, the user is exposed<br>
to the risk of being stuck by the needle when sleeving the tip<br>
protector back on the syringe. There are many syringes with<br>
a retractable needle that is retracted into a barrel by pulling<br>
a plunger backward. However, it is desirable to improve the<br>
steady retraction movement of the needle and to reduce defective<br>
products during manufacture.<br>
The object of the present invention is toprovide a disposable<br>
syringe which permits steady and successful retraction of a<br>
needle, and which can reduce failure in production.<br>
According to this invention, the disposable syringe<br>
includes a barrel, a tubular needle seat and a plunger. The<br>
barrel has an axially extending surrounding barrel wall which<br>
defines a passage with front and rear open ends. An inner wall<br>
surface of the surrounding barrel wall includes front and rear<br>
surface segments and an intermediate surface segment disposed<br>
therebetween. The intermediate surface segment has a retaining<br>
region axially distal from the front surface segment, and first<br>
and second friction diminishing regions respectively<br>
interposed between the retaining region and the front surface<br>
segment, and between the retaining region and the rear surface<br>
segment.<br>
The tubular needle seat is insertable into the passage from<br>
the rear open end, and includes a front engaging portion in<br>
fluid-tight engagement with the front surface segment to fix<br>
a needle cannula, a retaining portion which is disposed<br>
rearwardly of the front engaging portion, and which is retained<br>
at the retaining region by virtue of a first frictional force<br>
when the needle seat is in a position of use, a rear engaging<br>
portion which extends rearwardly from the retaining portion<br>
to terminate at a rearwardly facing wall, and a surrounding<br>
sealing flange which extends from the rearwardly facing wall<br>
radially and outwardly to be in fluid-tight engagement with<br>
the rear surface segment, and which extends forwardly to<br>
terminate at a surrounding flange surface that is movable<br>
towards the second friction diminishing region. The rear<br>
engaging portion has an inner tubular wall surface defining<br>
a cavity which extends from the rearwardly facing wall to<br>
terminate at a ceiling wall. The ceiling wall has an axial hole<br>
which establishes a fluid communication between the needle<br>
cannula and the cavity. A radially yieldable catch is disposed<br>
on the inner tubular wall surface distal from the ceiling wall,<br>
and is yieldable radially and outwardly in response to a kinetic<br>
frictional force.<br>
The plunger is movable in the passage, and has a front end<br>
wall, an engaging head opposite to the front end wall, and a<br>
neck interposed therebetween and of a dimension such that a<br>
rearwardly facing shoulder wall is formed between the engaging<br>
head and the neck. The kinetic frictional force is generated<br>
as a result of axial movement of the engaging head relative<br>
to the radially yieldable catch towards the ceiling wall. A<br>
deformable sealing member is sleeved on the engaging head and<br>
the neck, is in frictional engagement with the engaging head<br>
with a second frictional force, and is sealingly slidable<br>
relative to the rear surface segment.<br>
In the position of use, the deformable sealing member is<br>
moved forward by virtue of forward movement of the plunger to<br>
abut against the rearwardly facing wall, while the engaging<br>
head is extended into the cavity.<br>
When the plunger is to be placed in a disposal position,<br>
the engaging head is kept moving towards the ceiling wall by<br>
a pushing force which is applied to the plunger, and which,<br>
when the deformable sealing member is blocked by the rearwardly<br>
facing wall from moving with the engaging head, overcomes the<br>
second frictional force, thereby exposing the neck so as to<br>
permit the rearwardly facing shoulder wall to be forced to slip<br>
over the radially yieldable catch and to be prevented from moving<br>
rearwardly by the radially yieldable catch.<br>
After the rearwardly facing shoulder wall has slipped over<br>
the radiallyyieldable catch, continued movement of the engaging<br>
head towards the ceiling wall, against the first frictional<br>
force, forces the retaining portion and the surrounding sealing<br>
flange to move past the first and second friction diminishing<br>
regions, respectively, so as to facilitate a subsequent pulling<br>
action of the plunger whereby the needle seat is brought towards<br>
the rear open end by virtue of the retaining engagement of the<br>
rearwardly facing shoulder wall and the radially yieldable catch,<br>
thereby retracting the needle cannula into the passage.<br>

Before the present invention is described in greater detail,<br>
it should be noted that same reference numerals have been used<br>
to denote like elements throughout the specification.<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the first preferred embodiment<br>
of a disposable syringe according to the present invention is<br>
shown to comprise a barrel 1, a tubular needle seat 2, a needle<br>
assembly 3 including a needle cannula 31 and a tip protector<br>
32, and a plunger 4.<br>
The barrel 1 has a surrounding barrel wall 12 which surrounds<br>
an axis (X) in a longitudinal direction and which defines a<br>
passage 11 therein that has front and rear open ends 123, 124<br>
opposite to each other. The surrounding barrel wall 12 has inner<br>
and outer wall surfaces 121, 122. The inner wall surface 121<br>
includes a smaller-diameter front surface segment 126 and a<br>
larger-diameter rear surface segment 12 5 proximate to the front<br>
and rear open ends 123, 124, respectively, and an intermediate<br>
surface segment 12 7 disposed therebetween and converging from<br>
the rear surface segment 125 to the front surface segment 126.<br>
The intermediate surface segment 12 7 has a retaining region<br>
14 which is axially distal from the front surface segment 12 6<br>
and which extends radially and outwardly to form an annular<br>
recess 14. An annular shoulder abutment 13 is formed on the<br>
intermediate surface segment 127 rearwardly of the retaining<br>
region 14. Moreover, the intermediate surface segment 127<br>
defines first and second friction diminishing regions 1271,<br>
1272 which are respectively interposed between the retaining<br>
region 14 and the front surface segment 126, and between the<br>
retaining region 14 and the rear surface segment 125 to be<br>
described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
The outer wall surface 122 of the barrel 1 has a rib portion<br>
12 9 extending in the longitudinal direction and disposed<br>
adjacent to the front open end 123. The tip protector 32 of<br>
the needle assembly 3 is disposed to sleeve on the outer wall<br>
surface 122 from the front open end 123, and is frictionally<br>
retained by the rib portion 129 for shielding the needle cannula<br>
31.<br>
The needle seat 2 is insertable into the passage 11 from<br>
the rear open end 124 to surround the axis (X) . The needle seat<br>
2 includes a front engaging portion 22, a retaining portion<br>
23, a rear engaging portion 25, a surrounding sealing flange<br>
251, a plurality of radially yieldable catches 263, and a<br>
plurality of axially extending ribs 262.<br>
The front engaging portion 22 is configured to be in<br>
fluid-tight engagement with the front surface segment 126, and<br>
is disposed to fix the needle cannula 31 of the needle assembly<br>
3 along the axis (X) . Specifically, the front engaging portion<br>
22 has a filling hole 292 filled with an adhesive to affix a<br>
secured segment 311 of theneedle cannula 31 to the front engaging<br>
portion 22 (see Fig. 3) . In this embodiment, the front surface<br>
segment 126 of the barrel 1 is configured to converge toward<br>
the front open end 123 to form a narrow opening 128 in the front<br>
open end 123 for passage of a sharp segment 312 of the needle<br>
cannula 31, thereby preventing removal of the needle seat 2<br>
from the front open end 123.<br>
The retaining portion 23 is disposed rearwardly of the front<br>
engaging portion 22, and is retained at the retaining region<br>
14 by virtue of a first frictional force when the needle seat<br>
2 is in a position of use. In particular, the retaining portion<br>
23 has a plurality of fins 272 which are angularly displaced<br>
from one another about the axis (X) , and which are spaced apart<br>
from the first diminishing region 1271 radially so as to form<br>
a first movement space 273 therebetween. Each fin 272 is<br>
configured such that a contour constituted by the fins 272 about<br>
the axis (X) serves as a protrusion 28. The protrusion 28 is<br>
retained in the annular recess 14 by virtue of the first<br>
frictional force.<br>
The rear engaging portion 2 5 extends rearwardly from the<br>
retaining portion 23 to terminate at a rearwardly facing wall<br>
212. The surrounding sealing flange 251 extends from the<br>
rearwardly facing wall 212 radially and outwardly to be in<br>
fluid-tight engagement with the rear surface segment 125, and<br>
extends forwardly to terminate at a surrounding flange surface<br>
253. The surrounding flange surface 253 is spaced apart from<br>
the shoulder abutment 13 by the second friction diminishing<br>
region 1272 so as to forma second movement space 252 therebetween.<br>
Furthermore, the rear engaging portion 25 has an inner tubular<br>
wall surface 2 61 which surrounds the axis (X) to define a cavity<br>
26 that extends from the rearwardly facing wall 212 towards<br>
the front engaging portion 22 and that terminates at a ceiling<br>
wall 24. The ceiling wall 24 has an axial hole 291 which is<br>
in fluid communication with the filling hole 292 to establish<br>
a fluid communication between the needle cannula 31 and the<br>
cavity 26.<br>
The radially yieldable catches 263 and the axially extending<br>
ribs 262 are formed on the inner tubular wall surface 261 distal<br>
from and proximate to the ceiling wall 24, respectively, and<br>
are angularly displaced from one another about the axis (X) .<br>
The radially yieldable catches 2 63 are yieldable radially and<br>
outwardly in response to a kinetic frictional force to be<br>
described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
The plunger 4 is disposed to be movable in the passage 11<br>
along the rear surface segment 125, and has a front end wall<br>
41, an engaging head 43 which is opposite to the front end wall<br>
41 in the longitudinal direction and which has a plurality of<br>
axially extending grooves 432, a neck 44 which is interposed<br>
between the engaging head 4 3 and the front end wall 41, and<br>
which is of a dimension such that a rearwardly facing shoulder<br>
wall 431 is formed between the engaging head 43 and the neck<br>
44, and such that the aforesaid kinetic frictional force is<br>
generated as a result of axial movement of the engaging head<br>
43 relative to the radially yieldable catches 2 63 towards the<br>
ceiling wall 24, and an axially extending stem 42 which is<br>
interposed between the neck 44 and the front end wall 41. A<br>
deformable sealing member 4 5 is sleeved on the engaging head<br>
43 and the neck 44 , is in f rictional engagement with the engaging<br>
head 43 with a second f rictional force, and is sealingly slidable<br>
relative to the rear surface segment 125. Furthermore, the<br>
deformable sealing member 45 is spaced apart from the front<br>
end wall 41 so as to permit relative movement of the deformable<br>
sealing member 45 towards the front end wall 41 when a pushing<br>
force is applied to the plunger 4 to overcome the second<br>
frictional force to be described in greater detail hereinafter.<br>
Referring to Fig. 4, in the position of use, i.e., during<br>
an injection procedure, as shown in Fig. 4, the deformable<br>
sealing member 45 is moved forward by virtue of forward movement<br>
of the plunger 4 to abut against the rearwardly facing wall<br>
212, while the engaging head 43 extends into the cavity 26.<br>
The syringe is thus placed in an injection completed state.<br>
Referring to Fig. 5, when the plunger 4 is to be placed<br>
in a disposal position, the engaging head 43 is kept moving<br>
towards the ceiling wall 24 by a pushing force which is applied<br>
to the plunger 4, and which, when the deformable sealing member<br>
45 is blocked by the rearwardly facing wall 212 from moving<br>
with the engaging head 4 3 and is moved rearwardly towards the<br>
front end wall 41, overcomes the second frictional force,<br>
thereby exposing the neck 44 to permit the rearwardly facing<br>
shoulder wall 431 to be forced to slipover the radial lyyieldable<br>
catches 2 63 and to be retained thereby such that the rearwardly<br>
facing shoulder wall 431 is prevented from moving rearwardly.<br>
Meanwhile, the axially extending grooves 432 are brought to<br>
mate with the axially extending ribs 262 so as to put the needle<br>
seat 2 into splined engagement with the engaging head 43.<br>
Thereafter, continued movement of the engaging head 43<br>
towards the ceiling wall 24 , against the first f rictional force,<br>
i.e. the f rictional retention of the protrusion 28 in the annular<br>
recess 14 , forces the fins 2 72 and the surrounding sealing flange<br>
251 to move past the first and second friction diminishing<br>
regions 1271, 1272, respectively, until the surrounding flange<br>
surface 2 53 abuts against the shoulder abutment 13. Subsequent<br>
turning of the plunger 4 by the user to turn the needle seat<br>
2 relative to the barrel 1 further diminish the friction<br>
therebetween to facilitate a subsequent pulling action of the<br>
plunger 4 whereby the needle seat 2 is brought towards the rear<br>
open end 124 by virtue of the retention of the rearwardly facing<br>
shoulder wall 431 by the radiallyyieldable catches 263 , thereby<br>
retracting the needle cannula 31 into the passage 11, as shown<br>
in Fig. 6. Finally, the plunger 4 can be broken at a weakened<br>
part for convenient disposal of the syringe.<br>
Fig. 7 shows the second preferred embodiment of a disposable<br>
syringe according to this invention. In addition to the<br>
components of the first preferred embodiment described above,<br>
the disposable syringe of this embodiment further comprises<br>
an o-ring 5 which is sleeved tightly on the front engaging port ion<br>
22 of the needle seat 2, and which surrounds the axis (X) so<br>
as to enhance fluid-tightness of the engagement between the<br>
front surface segment 126 and the front engaging portion 22.<br>
In the third preferred embodiment of a disposable syringe<br>
shown in Fig. 8, an o-ring 5 is disposed on the rear engaging<br>
portion 25 so as to enhance fluid-tightness of the engagement<br>
between the rear surface segment 12 5 and the surrounding sealing<br>
flange 251.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, the fourth preferred embodiment of<br>
a disposable syringe according to this invention is similar<br>
to the first preferred embodiment in construction. The<br>
differences reside in that the intermediate surface segment<br>
127 has a plurality of fins 131 which are angularly displaced<br>
from one another about the axis (X) and which extend rearwardly<br>
to be spaced apart from the surrounding sealing flange 251 by<br>
the second friction diminishing region 1272 . In addition, each<br>
of the fins 131 extends radially and inwardly to terminate at<br>
a distal end 1311. The distal ends 1311 of the fins 131 are<br>
configured such that a contour constituted by the distal ends<br>
1311 about the axis (X) serves as the annular recess 14 . Moreover,<br>
the retaining portion 23 is formed with an annular protrusion<br>
28 to be retained in the recess 14 by virtue of the first<br>
frictional force. Furthermore, a plurality of fins 272 are<br>
formed on the ceiling wall 24 , and are angularly displaced from<br>
one another.<br>
Fig. 10 shows the fifth preferred embodiment of a disposable<br>
syringe according to this invention, which is substantially<br>
similar to the fourth preferred embodiment. In this embodiment,<br>
an 0-ring 5 is further sleeved tightly on the front engaging<br>
portion 22 of the needle seat 2, and is disposed to surround<br>
the axis (X) so as to enhance the fluid-tightness of the<br>
engagement between the front surface segment 12 6 and the front<br>
engaging portion 22.<br>
Referring to Figs. 11 to 12, the sixth preferred embodiment<br>
of a disposable syringe is shown to include a selected one of<br>
the needle seats 2 of the above embodiments . In this embodiment,<br>
the outer wall surface 122 of the barrel 1 has an annular step<br>
portion 120 that faces forwardly, and that is distal from the<br>
front open end 123, and a surrounding front segment 1221<br>
interposed between the front open end 123 and the annular step<br>
portion 120. The ribs 129 are formed rearwardly of the<br>
surrounding front segment 1221 so as to retainingly engage the<br>
tip protector 32 . In addition, the disposable syringe further<br>
comprises a catheter hub 33 and a tubular catheter 34 for<br>
performing an intravenous catheter introducing process.<br>
Specifically, the catheter hub 33 includes a surrounding hub<br>
wall which has a sleeve portion that is sleeved on the surrounding<br>
front segment 1221 and that has a terminal edge abutting against<br>
the step portion 120, and a tip portion opposite to the sleeve<br>
portion along the axis (X) . The tubular catheter 34 includes<br>
a proximate segment which is disposed in the tip portion and<br>
which extends along the axis (X), and a distal segment which<br>
extends from the proximate segment along the axis (X) to project<br>
outwardly of the tip portion. As such, after the tubular catheter<br>
34 is introduced into a patient' s vein by insertion of the needle<br>
cannula 31, the barrel 1 is separated from the catheter hub<br>
33 so as to complete the intravenous catheter introducing<br>
process . The needle cannula 31 is then retracted into the barrel<br>
1 in the same manner as described above, as shown in Fig. 12.<br>
Referring to Figs. 13 and 14, the seventh preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe is shown to be similar to<br>
the sixth preferred embodiment in construction and function,<br>
except that the barrel 1 and the needle seat 2 are the same<br>
as those of the fourth and fifth preferred embodiments shown<br>
in Figs. 9 and 10. Furthermore, the front engaging portion 22<br>
of the needle seat 2 is filled with an adhesive to affix a secured<br>
segment 311 of the needle cannula 31 to the front engaging portion<br>
22.<br>
Referring to Figs. 15 and 16, the disposable syringe of<br>
the eighth preferred embodiment is adapted for injecting<br>
medication of an extremely small volume, such as 1 ml. That<br>
is, the barrel 1 and the plunger 4 have relatively smaller<br>
diameters. The needle seat 2 may have an 0-ring 5 or fins 272<br>
disposed on the ceiling wall 24.<br>
Referring to Figs . 17 and 18, the ninth preferred embodiment<br>
of a disposable syringe according to this invention is shown<br>
to be similar to the first preferred embodiment in construction.<br>
The differences therebetween are as follows . The front engaging<br>
portion 22 of the needle seat 2 has a seat segment which is<br>
configured to extend outwardly of the barrel 1 from the front<br>
open end 123 when the needle seat 2 is in the position of use.<br>
With reference to Fig. 19, the intermediate surface segment<br>
127 has a plurality of barriers 15 which are angularly displaced<br>
from one another about the axis (X) so as to define a recessed<br>
access 151 between two adjacent ones of the barriers 15. With<br>
reference to Fig. 20, the retaining region 14 has a plurality<br>
of recesses 141 which are angularly displaced from one another<br>
about the axis (X) and which are spaced apart from one another<br>
by protrusions 142, and a plurality of bumps 143 respectively<br>
extending from the recesses 141 inwardly and radially.<br>
The retaining portion 23 of the needle seat 2 has a plurality<br>
of partitions 272 in the form of fins 272 which are angularly<br>
displaced from one another about the axis (X) , and a plurality<br>
of blocking segments 2 9 which respectively extend from the<br>
partitions 2 72 radially and outwardly. As mentioned above, when<br>
the needle seat 2 is brought to be inserted into the passage<br>
11 from the rear open end 124 during assembly, and immediately<br>
after each of the partitions 272 is brought to pass the<br>
corresponding recessed access 151 between two adjacent ones<br>
of the barriers 15, as shown in Fig. 19, each of the partitions<br>
272 is turned a predetermined angle in one of clockwise and<br>
counterclockwise directions such that each of the blocking<br>
segments 2 9 is received in and is engaged with a respective<br>
one of the recesses 141 by virtue of the first frictional force,<br>
as shown in Fig. 20, while being prevented by the corresponding<br>
barrier 15 from axial movement relative to the second<br>
diminishing region 1272, thereby placing the needle seat 2<br>
firmly in the position of use.<br>
Moreover, when the plunger 4 is placed in the disposal<br>
position and the needle seat 2 is retained onto the plunger<br>
4, the user can rotate the needle seat 2 so that the partitions<br>
272 are turned the predetermined angle in a corresponding one<br>
of the counterclockwise and clockwise directions, as indicated<br>
by dotted lines in Fig. 21 so that the blocking segments 29<br>
slip over the bumps 143, respectively (as indicated by solid<br>
lines in Fig. 21) . Thus, the user can be aware of the approaching<br>
of the blocking segments 29 to a position where the blocking<br>
segments 2 9 are unrestrained by the barriers 15 and are permitted<br>
to perform the axial movement. Therefore, the needle seat 2<br>
is allowed to be pulled rearwardly so as to retract the needle<br>
cannula 31 into the passage 11, as shown in Fig. 22.<br>
Furthermore, in addition to having the partitions 272 formed<br>
on the retaining portion 23, the needle seat 2 has a plurality<br>
of fins 272 formed on the ceiling wall 24 and on the seat segment<br>
of the front engaging portion 22 . The tip protector 32 is disposed<br>
to sleeve on and is f rictionally retained onto the seat segment<br>
of the front engaging portion 22 for shielding the sharp segment<br>
312 of the needle cannula 31.<br>
Referring to Fig. 23, the tenth preferred embodiment of<br>
a disposable syringe according to this invention is similar<br>
to the ninth preferred embodiment, and further comprises an<br>
O-ring 5 which is disposed on the front engaging portion 22<br>
of the needle seat 2 so as to enhance fluid-tightness of the<br>
engagement between the front engaging portion 22 and the front<br>
surface segment 12 6 of the barrel 1.<br>
Referring to Figs. 24 and 25, in the eleventh preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this invention,<br>
a catheter hub 33 and a tubular catheter 34 are further provided<br>
for performing an intravenous catheter introducing process.<br>
The catheter hub 33 includes a surrounding hub wall which has<br>
a sleeve portion that is sleeved on the seat segment of the<br>
front engaging portion 22, and a tip portion opposite to the<br>
sleeve portion along the axis (X). The tubular catheter 34<br>
includes a proximate segment which is disposed in the tip portion<br>
and which extends along the axis (X) , and a distal segment which<br>
extends from the proximate segment along the axis (X) and<br>
outwardly of the tipportion. Moreover, since the sleeve portion<br>
of the catheter hub 33 is sleeved on the seat segment of the<br>
front engaging portion 22, there is no need to form fins on<br>
the seat segment.<br>
Referring to Figs. 26 and 27, the twelfth preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this invention<br>
is shown to be similar to the ninth preferred embodiment. In<br>
this embodiment, the needle seat 2 further includes a hub segment<br>
35 which is configured to fix the secured segment 311 of the<br>
needle cannula 31 along the axis (X) , and which is sleeved on<br>
the seat segment of the front engaging portion 22 to establish<br>
fluid communication between the needle cannula 31 and the axial<br>
hole 2 91 through the fill ing hole 2 92 which is free from adhesive .<br>
The hub segment 35 has a rib portion 353 formed on an outer<br>
surface 3 51 thereof so as to retain the tip protector 32 for<br>
shielding the sharp segment 312 of the needle cannula 31.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 8 and 29, the thirteenth preferred<br>
embodiment of a disposable syringe according to this invention<br>
is shown to be similar to the twelfth preferred embodiment in<br>
construction, and further comprises a catheter hub 33 and a<br>
tubular catheter 34 for performing an intravenous catheter<br>
introducing process. That is, the catheter hub 33 includes a<br>
surrounding hub wall which has a sleeve portion sleeved on the<br>
hub segment 3 5 , and a tip portion opposite to the sleeve portion<br>
along the axis (X) . The tubular catheter 34 includes a proximate<br>
segment which is disposed in the tip portion and which extends<br>
along the axis (X), and a distal segment which extends from<br>
the proximate segment along the axis (X) and outwardly of the<br>
tip portion. The tip protector 32 is sleeved retainingly on<br>
the surrounding hub wall of the catheter hub 33.<br>
Referring to Fig. 30, in the fourteenth preferred embodiment<br>
of a disposable syringe according to this invention, which has<br>
a construction similar to that of the eleventh preferred<br>
embodiment, an 0-ring 5 is additionally disposed on the front<br>
engaging portion 22 of the needle seat 2. Moreover, any forms<br>
of the needle assembles 3, such as that including the catheter<br>
hub 33 and the tubular catheter 34 , that including the hub segment<br>
35, and that including the catheter hub 33, the tubular catheter<br>
34 and the hub segment 35, can be provided for use with the<br>
needle seat 2 as required.<br>
The advantages of the disposable syringe of this invention<br>
are as follows:<br>
1. The retaining portion 23 and the surrounding sealing<br>
flange 251 are moved past the first and second friction<br>
diminishing regions 1271,1272, respectively, when the plunger<br>
4 is to be placed in the disposal position so as to diminish<br>
the friction between the needle seat 2 and the inner wall surface<br>
121 of the barrel 1, thereby facilitating a subsequent pulling<br>
action of the plunger 4 for retracting the needle cannula 31<br>
into the barrel 1. Moreover, by virtue of the splined engagement<br>
between the axially extending ribs 262 and the grooves 432,<br>
the needle seat 2 is rotated with the plunger 4 to thereby further<br>
diminish the friction between the needle seat 2 and the inner<br>
wall surface 121 of the barrel 1. Therefore, the retraction<br>
of the needle cannula 31 can be successful and steady.<br>
2. The provision of angularly displaced fins 272 on the<br>
needle seat 2 helps prevent contraction and deformation of the<br>
needle seat 2 during plastic injection molding due to the<br>
cohesion property of the plastic material, thereby reducing<br>
failure in production.<br>
3 . Since the front engaging portion 22 and the surrounding<br>
sealing flange 251 of the needle seat 2 are in fluid-tight<br>
engagement with the front and rear surface segments 126, 125<br>
of the barrel 1, the engagement being enhanced by the provision<br>
of O-rings 5 andby virtue of the first f rictional force generated<br>
between the retaining portion 23 (the protrusion 28) and the<br>
retaining region 14 (the annular recess 14) , the needle seat<br>
2 can be firmly retained in the passage 11 of the barrel 1 with<br>
a fluid-tight engagement therebetween.<br>
