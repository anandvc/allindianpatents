				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to substituted azabicyclo [3.1.0] hexane derivatives.<br>
The compound of this invention can function as muscarinic receptor antagonists, and can be used for the treatment of various diseases of the respiratory, urinar&gt; and gastrointestinal systems mediated through muscarinic receptors.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the present invention and the methods of treating the diseases mediated through muscarinic receptors.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Muscarinic receptors as members of the G Protein Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) are composed of a family of 5 receptor sub-types (M1, M2. M3, M4 and M5) and are activated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. These receptors are widely distributed on multiple organs and tissues and are critical to the maintenance of central and peripheral cholinergic neurotransmission. The regional distribution of these receptor sub-types in the brain and other organs has been documented. For example, the M| subtype is located primarily in neuronal tissues such as cereberal cortex and autonomic ganglia, the M2 subtype is present mainly in the heart where it mediates cholinergically induced bradycardia, and the M3 subtype is located predominantly on smooth muscle and salivary glands (Nature, 1986; 323: 411; Science. 1987; 237: 527).A review in Current Opinions in Chemical Biology, 1999; 3: 426, a* well as in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001; 22: 409 by Eglen et. al., describe the biological potentials of modulating muscarinic receptor subtypes by ligands in different disease conditions like Alzheimer's disease, pain, urinary disease condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease etc.<br>
A review in J. Med. Chem., 2000; 43: 4333 by Christian C. Felder et. al. describes therapeutic opportunities for muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system and elaborates on muscarinic receptor structure and function, pharmacology and their therapeutic uses.<br>
The pharmacological and medical aspects of the muscarinic class of acetylcholine agonists and antagonists are presented in a review in Molecules, 2001, 6: 142.<br>
N..I.M. Birdsall et al. in Trends in Pharmacological Sciences, 2001; 22: 215 have also summarized the recent developments on the role of different muscarinic receptor subtypes using different muscaranic receptors of knock out mice.<br><br><br>
Muscarinic agonists such as muscarine and pilocarpine and antagonists such as atropine have been known for over a century, but little progress has been made in the discovery of receptor subtype-selective compounds making it difficult to assign specific functions to the individual receptors. Although classical muscarinic antagonists such as atropine are potent bronchodilators, their clinical utility is limited due to high incidence of both peripheral and central adverse effects such as tachycardia, blurred vision, dryness of mouth, constipation, dementia, etc. Subsequent development of the quarterly derivatives of atropine such as ipratropium bromide are better tolerated than parenterally administered options but most of them are not ideal anti-cholinergic bronchodilators due to lack of selectivity for muscarinic receptor sub-types. The existing compounds offer limited therapeutic benefit due to their lack of selectivity resulting in dose limiting side-effects such as thirst, nausea, mydriasis and those associated with the heart such as tachycardia mediated b\ the M2 receptor.<br>
Annual review of Pharmacological Toxicol.. 2001; 41: 691, describes the pharmacology of the lower urinary tract infections. Although anti muscarinic agents such as oxybulynin and tolterodine that act non-selectively on muscarinic receptors have been used for many years to tieat bladder hyperactivity, the clinical effectiveness of these agents has been limited due to the side effects such as dry mouth, blurred vision and constipation. I'ollerodine is considered to be generally better tolerated than oxybutynin. (W.D.Steers, et. al. in C'urr. Opin. Invest. Drugs, 2: 268, C.R. Chappie et al. in Urology, 55: 33), Steers WD, Barrot DM, Wein AJ, 1996, Voiding dysfunction: diagnosis classification and management. In "Adult and Pediatric Urology." ed. JY Gillenwatter, JT Grayhack, SS Howards. JW Duckell, pp 1220-1325, St. Louis, MO; Mosby. 3rd edition).<br>
Despite these advances, there remains a need for development of new highly selective muscarinic antagonists which can interact with distinct subtypes, thus avoiding the occurrence of adverse effects.<br>
Compounds having antagonistic activity against muscarinic receptors have been described in Japanese patent application Laid Open Number 92921/1994 and 135958/1994; WO 93/16048; U.S. Patent No. 3,176.019; GB 940,540; EP 0325 571; WO 98/29402: EP 0801067: EP 0388054; WO 9109013; U.S. Patent No. 5,281,601. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,174.900, 0.130.232 and 5,948,792; WO 97/45414 are related to 1,4-disubstituted piperidine derivatives: WO 98/05641 describes fluorinated, 1,4-disubstitued piperidine derivatives; W096/33973 are other close art references.<br><br><br>
A report in J. Med. Chem., 2002; 44:984, describes cyclohexylmethyl piperidinyl triphenylpropioamide derivatives as selective M3 antagonist discriminating against the other receptor subtypes.<br>

Biological Activity<br>
Radioligand Binding Assays:<br>
The affinity of test compounds for M2 and M3 muscarinic receptor subtypes was determined by [3H]-N-methylscopolamine binding studies using rat heart and submandibular gland respectively as described by Moriya et al.. (Life Sci.. 1999; 64 (25): 2351-2358).<br><br><br>
Membrane preparation: Submandibular glands and heart were isolated and placed in ice cold homogenising buffer (HEPES 20mM, 10mM EDTA, pH 7.4) immediately after sacrifice. The tissues were homogenised in 10 volumes of homogenising buffer and the homogenate was filtered through two layers of wet gauze and filtrate was centrifuged at 500g for 10min. The supernatant was subsequently centrifuged at 40, 000g for 20 min. The pellet thus obtained was resuspended in same volume of assay buffer (HEPES 20mM, EDTA 5mM, pH 7.4) and were stored at -70°C until the time of assay.<br>
Ligand binding assay: The compounds were dissolved and diluted in DMSO. The membrane homogenates (150-250 µg protein) were incubated in 250 µl of assay buffer (HEPES 20 mM, pH 7.4) at 24-25°C for 3h. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 µM atropine. The incubation was terminated by vaccum filtration over GF/B liber filters(Wallac). The filters were then washed with ice cold 50mM Tris HCI buffer (pH 7.4). The filter mats were dried and bound radioactivity retained on filters was counted. The IC50 &amp; Kd were estimated by using the non-linear curve fitting program using G Pad Prism software. The value of inhibition constant Ki was calculated from competitive binding studies by using Cheng &amp; Prusoff equation (Biochem Pharmacol, 1973,22: 3099-3108), Ki = K50 /(1 +L/Kd), where L is the concentration of [3H]NMS used in the particular experiment. pKi = -log Ki<br>
Functional Experiments using isolated rat bladder: Methodology:<br>
Animals were euthanized by overdose of urethane and whole bladder was isolated and removed rapidly and placed in ice cold Tyrode buffer with the following composition (mMol/L) NaCl 137; KC1 2.7; CaCl2 1.8: MgCl2 0.1; NaHC03 11.9, NaH2PO4 0.4; Glucose 5.55 and continuously gassed with 95% O2 and 5% CO2<br>
The bladder was cut into longitudinal strips (3mm wide and 5-6 mm long) and mounted in 10 ml organ baths at 30°C, with one end connected to the base of the tissue holder and the other end connected to a polygraph through a force displacement transducer. Each tissue was maintained at a constant basal tension of 2 g and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour during which the PSS was changed every 15 min. At the end of equilibration period, the stabilization of the tissue contractile response was assessed with 1 µmol/L of Carbachol consecutively for 2-3 times.    Subsequently, a cumulative concentration response curve to<br><br><br>
carbachol (10-9 mol/L to 3 X 10° mol/L) was obtained.    After several washes, once the<br>
baseline was achieved, cumulative concentration response curve was obtained in presence of<br>
NC1- (NICE added 20 min prior to the second C1-C).<br>
The contractile results were expressed as % of control E max. ED50 values were calculated<br>
by lilting a non-linear regression curve (Graph Pad Prism) PKB values were calculated by the<br>
formula pKB = - log [(molar concentration of antagonist/ (dose ratio-1))]<br>
whercdose ratio = ED50 in the presence of antagonist/ED50 in the absence of antagonist.<br>
