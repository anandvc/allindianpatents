THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
1<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a location information sharing method based on wired and wireless internet using location ©(Identification). More particularly, the present invention relates to a location information sharing method based on wired and wireless internet using location ID, which can input location information including a location coordinate and a location ID corresponding to the location coordinate through a wired and wireless Internet terminal to register the inputted location ID into one or more location information domain servers, share the registered location ID between the wired and wireless Internet terminals, and search and utilize location information corresponding to the location ID.<br>
Background Art<br>
Recently, with an increase in the demand for using an Internet, products of various kinds combining a wired and wireless Internet function and a GPS(Global Positioning System) function have been developed and utilized. Additionally, the GPS function is also embedded in mobile telephones. According to the above current, application fields of location information is increasing, and especially, services for providing location information to or through Internet terminals have been increased rapidly. In general, to provide a location information service through the Internet terminals, a method that searches a specified location by utilizing an identifier capable of representing the location to be searched, such as an address, a trade name, a telephone number, a zip code, or others, and indicates the searched result on an electronic map has been used mainly.<br>
2<br><br>
However, the conventional method for providing the location information has several problems that it is occasionally impossible to search a desired location at places where there is no identifier, such as mountains, seas, or others, and that it is inconvenient in use because a user must find a desired trade name using additional information, such as an address, in the case where there are lots of the same trade names even though it is possible to search. Furthermore, the conventional method for providing location information has another problem that it is difficult to apply single software because the addresses are formed in different way by countries. Especially, in case of Korean addresses based on lot numbers, the conventional method for providing.location information has a restriction that one position cannot be mdicated by address, because the lot numbers represent not a spot location but a field location.<br>
Moreover, the conventional method for providing the location infonnation has a further problem that it is difficult to share location information databases in the case where service providers provide services through their own software and data format in a state that there is no standardized international format for indicating the same location information or in the case where the trade names stored in the databases by the service providers are different from one another.<br>
Additionally, the conventional method for providing location information has other problems that ■ it is difficult to share location information because the location information through the Internet terminal is transferred in an image type after being copying from a map view screen or in a text type for explaining the location. Furthermore, the conventional method for providing location information can not inform easily and simply the specific location using the location ID, and perform a navigation function by indicating the corresponding location or utilizing as location information of the user's destination using the received location ID without reinput<br>
3<br><br>
of the same location ID through the Internet terminal receiving the location ID.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in detail in connection with preferred<br>
embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings.   For reference, like<br>
reference characters designate corresponding parts throughout several views.<br>
FIG. 1 is a system block diagram for briefly explaining a method for sharing location<br>
information based on wired and wireless Internet using location ID according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
First, users input location mformation including a desired location coordinate and a<br>
3<br><br>
location ED(Identification) corresponding to the location coordinate using one or more wired or wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn, and register the location information into one or more location information domain servers 20a to 20n (see a flow chart of FIG. 4). Here, it is preferable that the format of the location ID inputted through the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn is combination of a user ID determined by each location by the user when the location information is registered, a location ID symbol selected to discriminate from an E-mail ID symbol, and a location information domain server address for storing and managing the registered location information.<br>
That is, the location ID symbol maybe #, !, $, %, &amp;, * or others excepting @, which is the E-mail ID symbol. For an example, in the case where the user wants to decide the user ID corresponding to the desired location coordinate as "szeelee" and register the location information including the location coordinate and the location ID into a location information domain server of www.gg21.co.kr, the location ID may be indicated as "szeelee#gg21.co.kr".<br>
After the location information including the location coordinate and the location ID is registered into the location information domain servers 20a to 20n, in the case where the location ID is transmitted and received through the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn or included in various documents, when the user selects the location ID, the user's terminal is connected to the location information domain servers 20a to 20n in which the location ID is registered, the location information corresponding to the location ID is searched and transmitted to the wired and wireless Internet terminal 10a to lOn requesting the location information, so that the location information is indicated on an electronic map or can perform a navigation function by designating the location information as a destination. It is preferable that the wired and wireless Internet terminals  10a to  lOn include<br>
9<br><br>
computers, notebooks, cellular phones, PDAs(Personal Digital Assistants), GPSs(Global Positioning Systems) and telematics terminals. The location information domain servers 20a to 20n are wired or wireless Internet servers. Additionally, it is preferable that the location information domain servers 20a to 20n include database systems and/or database management systems (not shown in drawings) for storing and managing the location information including the location coordinate and the corresponding location ID inputted from the users' wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow chart for showing the method for sharing location information based on wired and wireless Internet using location ID according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, the user checks whether or not a desired location information is registered (S100), and registers the desired location information if not registered. A process for registering the location information will be described referring to FIG. 4. That is, the user inputs location coordinate, to be registered, through the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn (S300). At this time, if the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn include the GPS receiver, the present location coordinate received through the GPS receiver are inputted automatically. The user directly inputs a value of the location coordinate hi letters or figures through the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn if the user knows the value of the location coordinate to be registered. If the user does not know the value of the location coordinate, when the user designates the desired location or area, which is indicated on the electronic map on the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn using an address, a trade name, a telephone number or an index map, the location coordinate corresponding to the location designated by the user are inputted automatically.<br>
IP<br><br>
When the location coordinate is inputted, the user inputs the location ID corresponding to the location coordinate in the same way as in FIG. 1 (S301). When the location information including the location coordinate and the location ID corresponding to the location coordinate is transferred to the location information domain servers 20a to 20n corresponding to the location ID, the terminals are connected to the location information domain servers 20a to 20b (S302). After that, it is checked whether or not the location ID is duplicated (S303), and if not, the location ID is registered to the corresponding location information domain server 20a to 20n (S304). Of course, if the location ID is duplicated (namely, if the user ID corresponding to the location coordinate is duplicated), duplication message is transmitted to the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn. Then, the users must return to the step 301, and inputs a new location ID.<br>
After the location information is registered, when the users input the location ID registered to the location information domain servers 20a to 20n through the wired an wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn, the location ID is transmitted to other wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn, so that a number of wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn can transmit and receive the location ID between them (SI01). The wired and wireless Internet terminal 10a to lOn of a receiving side selects the received location ID to request the location information (SI02). The location ID can be selected by cursor control units of various types, such as a mouse of the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn, a button of all directions, an input pen of a touch screen, a track ball, or others.<br>
When the user selects the location ID to request the location information, the terminal is automatically connected to the corresponding location information domain server 20a to 20n in which the location information is registered (SI03), and searches the registered  location information through    the location ID (SI04). The user checks<br>
H<br><br>
the searched result (S105), and if the search is carried out normally, the searched location information is transmitted to the wired and wireless Internet terminal 10a to lOn requesting the location information (SI06). If the search is failed, an error code of cause of the search failure is transmitted to the wired and wireless Internet terminal 10a to lOn requesting the location information (SI07). The searched location information includes the location ID and the location coordinate corresponding to the location ID.<br>
Furthermore, the searched location information may be indicated as a symbol on the electronic map through a GIS(Geographical Information System) software of the wired and wireless Internet terminals 10a to lOn (SI08), or perform the navigation function by designating the searched location information as the destination (SI09). FIG. 3 is a flow chart for showing the method for sharing location information based on wired and wireless Internet using location ID according to another preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
First, as in the embodiment of FIG. 2, the user checks whether or not the location information is registered (S200), and registers the location information if the location information is not registered. The process for registering the location information is the same as in FIG. 4. After the location information is registered, the user inputs the location ID into contents of various documents of the wired and wireless Intemet terminals 10a to lOn (S201), or loads various documents containing the location ID. As described above, the location ID is inputted as the format (for example, "szeeless#gg21.co.kr"), in which the user ID, the location ID symbol and the location information domain server address are combined. The various documents include documents made by a PM(Personal Information Management) software having an address book, a calendar, a note pad, and others, documents made by writing function in    bulletin    board    on    Web-pages,    documents made by various document<br>
12<br><br>
writing machines or editors, documents made as an E-mail, documents made by messengers, and documents made by a SMS(Short Message Service) of cellular phones.<br>
When the location ID is inputted in the various documents, the format of the location ID is checked (S202). After that, the location ID has an underline automatically formed by smart tag or other similar way and is converted to a predetermined color to allow the user to easily discriminate the location ID (S203). If the location ID does not conform to the predetermined form, an error message is outputted (S204), and the step is returned to the step 201.<br>
As described above, when the user selects the location ID to request the location information corresponding to the location ID (S205) after inputting the location ID into the contents of the various documents or loading the various documents containing the location ID, the terminal is connected to the corresponding location information domain server 20a to 20n (S206), and searches the registered location information through the location ID (S207). The searched location information is transmitted to the wired and wireless Internet terminal 10a to lOn requesting the location information, and can be indicated as a symbol on the electronic map through the GIS software (S208). The searched location information includes the location ID and the location coordinate corresponding to the location ID. The step 207 includes a searched result checking step for checking whether or not the search of the registered location information is carried out normally, and if the search is not carried out normally, the error code of the cause of failure is transmitted to the wired and wireless Internet terminal 10a to lOn requesting the location information. As described in the embodiment of FIG. 2, the location ID can be selected by cursor control units of various types, such as a mouse of the wired and wireless Internet terminals  10a to  lOn, a button of all    directions,  an input pen of a  touch<br>
*3<br><br>
screen, a track ball, or others. Furthermore, the searched location information may perform the navigation function for guidance of the road by being designated as a destination.<br>
As described above, according to the embodiments of the present invention, through the steps of inputting the location information including the location coordinate and the location ID corresponding to the location coordinate through the wired and wireless Internet terminals, registering the location information to one or more location information domain servers, commonly sharing the registered location ID between the wired and wireless Internet terminals, and automatically searching the location-information corresponding to the location ID when the user selects the location ID received between the wired and wireless Internet terminals or the location ID contained in various documents, the searched location information is received and indicated on the electronic map and can perform the navigation function for guidance ofroad.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
As described above, by the method for sharing location information based on wired and wireless Internet using location ID, the location information including the location coordinate and the location ID corresponding to the location coordinate is inputted through the wired and wireless Internet terminals, registered to one or more location information domain servers, and commonly shared between the wired and wireless Internet terminals, so that the users can search and utilize the location information corresponding to the location ID.<br>
Additionally, according to the present invention, when the user selects the location ID received between the wired and wireless Internet terminals or the location ID contained   in   various   documents,   the    terminal is automatically connected to<br>
14<br><br>
the location information domain servers. Therefore, the present invention can search the location information through the location ID, receive and indicate the searched location information on the electronic map, and perform the navigation function by designating the location information as the destination.<br>
