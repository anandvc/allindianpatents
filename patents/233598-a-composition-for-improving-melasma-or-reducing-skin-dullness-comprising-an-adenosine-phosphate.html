The present invention relates to a composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness comprising an adenosine phosphate"<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition that can effectively improve melasma. The present invention also relates to a method for improving melasma. Further, the invention relates to a composition that can effectively reduce skin dullness. The invention also relates to a method for reducing skin dullness.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Melasma is a disorder that occurs mainly in women, and produces light - brown symmetrie areas of pigmentation on both sides of the face unaccompanied by inflammation. The cause of the disorder has not yet been fully elucidated, however melasma may develop primarily due to polyendrocrine abnormalities by estrogen, adrenal cortex hormone, ACTH, etc., in association with sunlight irradiation, pregnancy, dysfunction of the ovaries, the taking of oral contraceptives, the taking of antiepileptics, etc.<br>
Conventionally, melasma is treated by methods for ellminating endogenous and exogenous causes of the disorder by (1) oral administration of vitamin C or a reduced glutathione<br><br><br>
agent, (2) elimination of causative agents such as drugs, etc., and (3) avoidance of sunlight irradiation by use of sunscreen (Hyojun Hifukagaku, 4th edition, pp 212-213, edited by Yoshio SATO, issued by Igaku-Shoin). However, the conventional treatment methods do not produce satisfactory effects and are thus unsatisfactory.<br>
Skin dullness is a serious aesthetic problem particularly for women and specifically denotes skin conditions such as loss of skin clarity, skin muddiness due to body waste accumulation, and uneven skin color. Skin dullness may be caused by a combination of various factors, such as skin muddiness or skin shading due to a thickened horny cell layer accompanied by aging, reduced f lushness in the skin, pigmentation, lowered skin resilience, yellowing of the skin, dirt such as sweat and sebum, etc.<br>
As described above, since skin dullness is caused by the involvement of various factors, skin dullness cannot be effectively reduced even by substances that have been considered as useful for removing chloasma. Various substances useful for reducing skin dullness have been examined to date, however, at the present time, a substance that can satisfactorily reduce skin dullness has not developed.<br>
It has been reported that purine nucleic acid-related substances exhibit various physiological functions, however it is not known that such substances can improve melasma and reduce<br><br>
skin dullness.<br>
It is known that purine nucleic acid-related substances are hard to formulate. When the substance concerned is blended in a composition to be a concentration such that its effects can be exhibited, the prepared composition is inferior in feeling of use, stability, etc. In particular, the substance is very difficult to add it into an emulsion due to its property of reducing the strength of membranes formed at the oil-water interfaces. Therefore, in order to formulate the substance into an emulsion, such as a milky lotion or cream, it is necessary to develop a method for improve the stability of the emulsion.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a composition that can effectively improve melasma, and a composition in the form of an O/W emulsion with favorable emulsif ication stability that can effectively improve melasma. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for effectively improving melasma.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a composition that can effectively reduce skin dullness, and a composition in the form of an O/W emulsion with favorable emulsification stability that can effectively reduce skin dullness. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for effectively reducing skin dullness.<br><br>
The present inventors carried out intensive research to solve the above-described problems, and found that purine nucleic acid-related substances present in the living body, in particular adenosinemonophosphates, i.e., amonophosphoric acid ester of adenosine, or salts thereof are excellent at improving melasma and reducing skin dullness. Further, the inventors found that an excellent emulsif ication stability can be given to such purine nucleic acid-related substances, which hitherto have been difficult to emulsify without losing the effects thereof, by preparing an O/W emulsion by blending the above-mentioned purine nucleic acid-related substance with a polyglyceryl fatty acid ester, an alkanoyl lactic acid or salts thereof, an acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer, water, and an oily component. The inventors conducted further research and accomplished the present invention based on these findings.<br>

(1)	The polyglyceryl fatty acid ester and the alkanoyl lactic<br>
acid or a salt thereof are mixed with the oil and preferably<br>
with a polyhydric alcohol. The mixture is stirred while being<br>
heated. After the mixture is uniformly dissolved, it is cooled<br>
to give a nonaqueous emulsion.<br>
(2)	The nonaqueous emulsion thus obtained is blended with an<br>
aqueous solution (aqueous composition) that is separately<br>
prepared and contains the purine nucleic acid-related<br>
subusutance, water and the acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate<br>
copolymer. The composition for improving melasma in the form<br>
of an 0/W emulsion is then prepared according to a conventional<br>
method.<br>
It is preferable to use the polyhydric alcohol in Process (1) for preparing the nonaqueous emulsion in order to further improve the development of the emulsifying ability of the polyglyceryl fatty acid ester, the alkanoyl lactic acid, etc.<br>
Polyhydric alcohols usable herein are not limited.

The particles of the resulting emulsion can be further refined by a homogenizer as required.<br>
The proportion of the nonaqueous emulsion to the aqueous solution (aqueous composition) is not limited. It is usually desirable to control the proportion of the nonaqueous emulsion to 1 to 40 wt.%, preferably 1 to 30 wt.%, based on the total amount of the composition for improving melasma, to thereby give a composition for improving melasma in the form of a more stable 0/W emulsion composition.<br>
The viscosity of the composition for improving melasma of the invention in the form of the O/W emulsion composition is not limited. It is usually desirable to prepare the O/W emulsion composition to have a viscosity of 30000 cps or less, preferably 500 to 20000 cps, at a temperature of 20° C (Viscometer: B-type viscometer. Rotor: No. 1 to 4, Rotation rate: 6, 12, 30, or 60 rpm).<br><br>
The above-described composition for improving melasma of the invention exerts the effect of improving melasma, when applied in the form of the externally-applied compositions to a melasma lesion, due to the effect of the purine nucleic acid-related substances included in the composition.

In view of low irritation to the skin and mucosa and pleasant skin feeling upon use, it is preferable to have a pH in the range of 2 to 7, more preferably 3 to 7, and further more preferably a weakly acidic pH of 5 to neutral pH of 7.<br>
The composition for improving melasma of the invention can exert the effect of improving melasma by being<br><br>
attached, sprayed or directly applied to a melasma lesion of the skin. The amount and frequency of application of the composition for improving melasma may be determined according to the types and concentrations of the purine nucleic acid-related substances used, the age of the user, the gender, the condition of the affected part of the skin, the application form, the effect intended, etc. The composition for improving melasma of the invention may be applied to the melasma lesion in a suitable amount once or several times per day.<br>

Test Example 1 Melasma improving test<br>
The following tests were conducted to evaluate the effect of improving melasma of a purine nucleic acid-related substance.<br><test method><br>
A suitable amount (an amount that can be uniformly applied to an entire face: about five drops) of the emulsion prepared according to the formulation of Example 1 was applied over the entire face of 27 patients with melasma, twice per day, after washing of the face, and this was continued for 16 weeks (except for one person who stopped by 12 weeks). Before initiation of the application, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after initiation of the application, a dermatologist made an overall evaluation of the color intensity and the range of melasma, and classified the condition of the melasma of each patient into five grades, "no melasma", "slight", "mild", "moderate", and "severe", according to the criteria of the following table 1.<br>
The dermatologist-diagnosed melasma grades of the patients were compared before and after initiation of the application to evaluate the degree of melasma improving according to the following criteria.<br>
Evaluation criteria of the degree of melasma improvement<br><br>
Cured Improvement<br>
(TableRemoved)<br>
Slight improvement<br>
No change or aggravationAll symptoms disappeared<br>
Improvement of two grades or better by the criteria of Table 1 achieved<br>
Improvement was observed: less than two grades by the criteria of Table 1<br>
No improvement<br>
Test results<br>
The obtained results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 shows the number of patients that met each of the above evaluation criteria of the melasma improving grade, the proportion of "slight improvement" or better (the proportion (%) of patients that showed "slight improvement" or better),<br>
and the 95% confidence interval of the percentage of patients with "slight improvement" or better, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after initiation of the application.<br>
(TableRemoved)<br>
As is evident from Table 2, the remarkable effect of improving melasma was exhibited by the use of emulsions comprising AMP2Na. More specifically, 12 weeks after initiation of the external application, 74.1% of the patients, and 16 weeks after initiation of the application, 92.3% of the patients showed improvement of melasma, and it was found that the effect of improving melasma was statistically significant.<br>
The above test results showed that the purine nucleic acid-related substance, when applied to the melasma lesion.<br>
exhibited an excellent melasma improving effect, and thus it was found that the substance is useful for improving melasma.<br>
Test example 2 Test for reducing skin dullness<br>
The following tests were conducted to evaluate the skin dullness reduction effect of apurine nucleic acid-related substance.<br>
Test Method<br>
A suitable amount (an amount that can be uniformly applied to the entire face: about five drops) of the emulsion prepared according to the formulation of Example 1 was applied over the entire face of 27 females with skin dullness, twice per day, after washing of the face, and this was continued for 16 weeks. Before initiation of the application, and 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after initiation of the application, the skin color tone of the subjects was measured using a color difference meter (OFC-300A, Nippon Denshoku Industries Co., Ltd.). The measurement value was obtained by measuring a L* value indicating lightness of the skin, an a* value indicating redness of the skin, and a b* value indicating yellowness of the skin of the evaluation target region of each patient 11 times, and calculating the mean of 7 measurement values of 11 values, excluding the 2 maximum and 2 minimum values.Test Results<br>
The obtained results are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows the mean average of the variation, AL* of the L* value indicating skin lightness, the mean average of the variation, Aa* of the value a* indicating redness, and the variation, AE*ab indicating color difference of the skin, (E*ab), 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks after initiation of the application as compared to the L* value, the a* value and the b* value of the subjects before application of the composition. The AE*ab value was calculated by formula 1. Formula 1<br>
AE*ab = [(AL*)2+ (Aa*)2 + (Ab*)2]1/2<br>
By the application of the emulsions comprising AMP2Na to the skin, the L* value of the skin (skin lightness) was significantly increased 4 weeks after initiation of the application, while the b* value indicating yellowness was significantly reduced 4 weeks after initiation of the application. The a* value indicating redness started to increase about 8 weeks after initiation of the application, and the Increase was significant 12 weeks after the initiation. The trend in the change of the a* value indicating redness showed that the change in the skin redness was not caused by the transient<br>
improvement in blood flow. It is known that the AE*ab value as an index for showing a change in color difference represents a total change in the skin with respect to lightness, redness.<br><br>
and yellowness, and in general the change in the skin can be subjectively and objectively observed when the A value generally reaches 2 or higher. Since the AE*ab value 4 weeks after initiation of the application was already above 2, it was found 5 that the skin color tone had already notably changed.<br>
The above test results showed that the purine nucleic<br>
acid-related substance exhibits an excellent skin dullness<br>
reduction effect when applied to the dullness region of the<br>
skin, and thus it was found that the substance is useful for<br>
10  reducing the skin dullness.<br>
Test Example 3 An emulsion stability test for the composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness in an O/W emulsified state:<br>
The following tests were conducted to evaluate the emulsion stability of a composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness in an O/W emulsified state.<br>
Test Method<br>
For evaluation of the emulsion stability test for a composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness in an O/W emulsified state, a composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness was prepared according to the formulation shown in Table 3. First, a polyglyceryl fatty acid ester, an alkanoyl lactate, an oil, and a polyhydric alcohol<br><br>
were blended, dissolved while being heated, and cooled, to prepare a uniform nonagueous emulsion. Mixed therewith was an aqueous composition (aqueous solution) that was separately prepared by dissolving in distilled water (pure water) an electrolyte, an acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer, a polyhydric alcohol, a lower alcohol, a pH adjuster, and an antiseptic. The mixture was stirred by a homomixer to give a composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness in an 0/W emulsified state (Examples 2 to 5). For comparison, a composition for improving melasma comprising no alkanoyl lactate (Comparative Example 1), and a composition for reducing skin dullness comprising no acrylic acid-alkyl methacrylate copolymer (Comparative Example 2) were prepared in the same manner as in Examples 2 to 5 (Table 4 shows the ingredients for these emulsion compositions).<br>
The ten compositions for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness (Examples 2 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2) thus prepared were each placed in two transparent glass bottles. One bottle was left to stand at a temperature of 60° C for 2 weeks, and the other bottle was subjected to a 14-cycle test at temperatures ranging from -5°C to 40°C (1 cycle: 24 hours). The appearance (separation, oil floating, presence/absence of gel formation) of each emulsion composition after the test was visually observed and evaluated according to the following criteria.<br><br><evaluation criteria><br>
A: Neither separation, oil floating, nor gel formation was<br>
observed.<br>
B: Separation, oil floating, or gel formation was observed.<br>
(TableRemoved)<br>
Test Results<br>
Tables 3 and 4 show the results of the emulsion stability test for the compositions for improving melasma of Examples 2 to 5 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2.<br>
As can be seen from the tables 3 and 4, the compositions for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness in an O/W emulsified state of Examples 2 to 5 inhibit water/oil phase separation, oil floating and gel formation and stably maintains their emulsified state under conditions in which the emulsion compositions are likely to be affected by long-term storage and temperature change, even when they contain a relatively large amount of AMP2Na. In contrast, as the<br>
comparative examples show, the emulsion composition in an 0/W emulsified state comprising no acrylic acid-alkylmethacrylate copolymer (Comparative Example 2) lacked long-term emulsion stability, and the emulsion composition comprising no alkanoyl lactate (Comparative Example 1) gelatedwith temperature change, thus failing to maintain a stable emulsified state.<br>
As is clear from the above, when formulated into an O/W emulsion composition as previously described, the composition for improving melasma or reducing the skin dullness can be provided in the form of emulsions or creams in a stable manner.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The composition for improving melasma of the invention exhibits an excellent melasma improving effect due to the action of the purine nucleic acid-related substance when applied to a melasma lesion.<br>
The composition for reducing skin dullness of the invention exhibits an excellent effect of reducing the skin dullness due to the action of the purine nucleic acid-related substance when applied to a dullness region of the skin.<br>
The purine nucleic acid-related substance included as an active ingredient in the composition for improving melasma or for reducing skin dullness is highly safe to the human body since such a substance is intrinsically present in the living<br>
body. Thus, the substance can be included in cosmetics in addition to externally-applied medical or quasi-medical drugs. Therefore, the present invention provides a means for improving melasma or skin dullness which can be carried out by the daily use of a cosmetic comprising the substance, and thus is easy for patients to use.<br>
Further, the composition for improving melasma or reducing skin dullness in an O/W emulsified state of the invention has a favorable emulsion stability in addition to an excellent effect for improving melasma or reducing the skin dullness, and thus is useful as an externally-applied agent for the skin in the form of a cream or emulsion.<br>
