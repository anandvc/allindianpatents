FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to stable salts of S-adenosyl-L-methionine, which in turn is synthesized by a novel chemical method. The novel compounds of the invention are found to be more stable compared to the commonly available SAMe disulfate monotosylate and SAMe butane- 1,4-disulfonate salts. The acute toxicity studies on the said salts have been successful and therefore, the salts are potential therapeutic agents.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
S-adenosyl-L-methionine, known as SAMe, is the main biological donor of methyl groups and it has several important therapeutic applications. As a substance existing in the living body, SAMe has been found to possess various pharmacological actions such as improvement of energy state of ischemic brain, improvement of cerebral energy metabolism and acidosis of the model with recirculated blood tlow following ischemia, etc. SAMe is an important molecule in normal cell function and its survival. SAMe is utilized by three key metabolic pathways: trans-methylation, trans-sulfuration and polyamine synthesis. Given the importance of SAMe in tissue function, it is not surprising that this molecule is being investigated as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of various clinical disorders (Int. J, Biochem. Cell Biol. (2000), 32 (4), 391-395).<br>
The main problem associated with the large-scale use of S-adenosyl-L-methionine is its thermal instability even at ambient temperature, and its preparation and purification complexity. Thus, the said product has been the subject of numerous patents aimed at providing new stable salts as well as process for preparation of these salts.<br>
While numerous salts of SAMe have been repotted, most of them suffered the disadvantage of stability at accelerated temperature and the practicability for the large scale manufacturing. In some of the disclosures, use of various organic &amp; inorganic stabilizers were reported but most of them could not give the required effect or they are not suitable for the large scale manufacturing. SAMe butane-1, 4-disulphonate as disclosed in US Patents 3954726 &amp; 4028183 has shown better stability &amp; is being produced on large scale: Hence it was taken as the referral point for the comparison of stability.<br>
Some of the known salts of SAMe &amp; the stabilizers used in the process are as under.<br>
The data published in Res. Disclo. (1991), 332, 927-933 has reported the carboxylic acid salts of SAMe like gallic acid, ascorbic acid &amp; maleic acid. EP 73376 &amp; 72980 discloses the hydrochloride, phosphate, sulfide &amp; methane sulfonate salts. In JP 53107485 salts of SAMe adsorbed on the resin were prepared by eluting with various organic acids originating from ethane, bromoethane, benzene, naphthalene, p-toluene, etc. FR 2275220 discloses the citrate, tartarate, maleate &amp; ascorbate salts of SAMe.<br>
US patent 5128249 disclosed the SAMe salts of dioctylsulphosuccinic acid, or of sulphonic acids or esters of sulphuric acids wherein the sulphonic acids or the esters of sulphuric acids are derived from long-chain linear or branched alkyl moiety containing 8-18 carbons atoms, and as a consequence of such a high molecular weight and high mole ratio, the content of these organic acids in the said salt goes upto 62-76%.<br>
JP 58049398 has reported the hydrochloride &amp; sulfate salt which are stabilized by using magnesium salts as additive.<br><br>
wo 89/03389 reported SAMe salts with high molecular weight oleyl and arachidonyl derivatives of taurine in a molar ratio of 1; &gt;4.2 which therefore results in a very low content of SAMe in the said salt.<br>
JP 59051213 has reported lactose as stabilizer while JP 5204869] has reported the use of lithium salts as stabilizer.<br>
JP 60181095 8i JP-Sho 61-91125 have reported the use of cyclodextrins as a stabilizer &amp; clearly reported the poor stability of the common haloacid salts of SAMe (like chloride, bromide, iodide, etc.) as well as the SAMe base. It has further disclosed the irritating characteristics of the salts reported so far, their high moisture sensitivity, poor storage stability, cost of the acids and their availability for commercial use, and the manufacturing difficulties due to which none of them are used as a therapeutic agents.<br>
Thus, there exists a need in the prior art to develop non-toxic new salts of SAMe which are stable at accelerated temperatures and further are equally or more stable as compared to butane-1,4- disulfonic acid salt. The applicants of the present invention, therefore, carried out intense investigation on a variety of systems in order to improve the storage stability of S-adenosyl-L- methionine. The study includes the effect of different type of acids, particularly, the sulphinic acids, and sulphonic acids-mono-, di-, tri sulphonic acids on aromatic or aliphatic systems, and the effect of the relative positions between them, like ortho-, meta-, or para-. Also, studies are the effects of the position of these acid functions with respect to other funtional groups in the aromatic ring which could be ortho-, meta-or para-. The applicants also studied the effect of different types of one or more substituents on the aromatic ring at various positions relative to the sulphonic acid functionality. The applicants found the involvement of the nature and type of the substituent pattern of the protonic as well as aprotic functional groups in influencing the stability of the SAMe salt. The extensive study on a wide range of molecular systems led finally to improve the stability of the SAMe, and the features which form the subject matter of the present invention are discussed below.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the stable salts of SAMe of the formula, SAMe. a R(S03X) b. c H2S04, wherein a varies between 0.6 and 1.3; b varies between 2 to 4; c varies between 1.4 to 2.5; X can be H or sodium; R is selected from a group of aromatics containing one or more hydroxy moieties.<br>
The present invention also relates to the process for preparing stable salts of SAMe as claimed in claim 1, said process comprising: i) converting S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine into (S-S)-isomer enriched-S-adenosyl-L-methionine; ii) producing S-adenosyl-L-methionine as a S-adenosyl-L-methionine sulfate salt; and iii) converting the S-adenosyl-L-methionine sulfate salt into a S-adenosyl-L-methionine mixed sulfate salt and spray drying with an inlet air temperature of 120 °C to 200 °C.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides three novel salts of SAMe, which are highly stable even at accelerated temperatures.<br><br>

However, the SAMe disulfate salt with analogous hydroquinone-2,3-disulphonic acid or its sodium salt was found to have poor stability at accelerated temperatures. The process for the preparation of SAMe is disclosed in the Applicants' co-pending US Patent<br>
Application No.	. The said process is a first ever report on the chemical synthesis of SAMe<br>

45oC with 70-75 % Relative Humidity and an improved HPLC method has been employed which<br>
resolves all the impurities formed on degradmg SAMe (Table I). This method of HPLC analysis is<br>
the best method known so far to study stability of SAMe and has been validated as per the ICH<br>
guidelmes. The details of the HPLC method followed and the accelerated stability report arc as<br>
under:<br>
