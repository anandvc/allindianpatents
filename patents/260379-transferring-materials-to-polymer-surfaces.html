				<td>TRANSFERRING MATERIALS TO POLYMER SURFACES<br>
This application concerns methods for applying a material to the surface of a polymer article and to polymer articles so produced.<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method of applying a heat-sensitive material to the surface of a polymer article manufactured from polymer heated to a sufficient temperature to destroy or at least adversely affect the heat sensitive material, whilst maintaining the integrity of the heat sensitive material-<br>
In certain embodiments, the invention provides a method of applying a material to defined areas of a textured surface of a polymer article, which may be a mass-produced article.<br>
Typical methods used in the mass production of polymer articles are injection moulding .and calendering, the latter process being frequently combined with extrusion.<br>
Injection moulding is performed by heating a suitable polymer until molten, injecting the molten polymer into a mould, allowing the polymer to cool and harden, and removing the moulded article from the mould.  This process may be automated and therefore used to produce a rapid succession of identical articles.  The mould used may have means for cooling, in order to increase the speed of hardening of the polymer.  A removable shim may be incorporated into the mould, and this shim may bear surface structure and/or texture that is transferred to the polymer article during the moulding process.  Alternatively, such structure may be present on the mould.<br>
Calendering is a process used to manufacture polymer sheeting,  A suitable polymer in pellet form is heated and forced through a series of heated rollers until the polymer sheet reaches the desired dimensions.  The sheeting is then<br><br>
passed through cooling rollers in order to cool and set the polymer.  Frec[uently, texture is applied to the polymer sheet during the process, or a strip of fabric is pressed into the back of the polymer sheet to fuse the two together.<br>
The calendering process may be used in combination with extrusion - the extruded polymer form may be passed through the heated rollers of the calender as above until the required dimensions are obtained, and then passed over cooling rollers to set the form of the polymer.<br>
In biotechnological applications, it is desirable to apply functional coatings to defined areas of articles for laboratory use, for example, multi-well plates, in order to reduce the likelihood of cross-contamination of samples.  A method of producing such articles at low cost would be particularly desirable as many such articles must be used only once.  It may be envisaged that the functional coating may be a coating to increase the affinity of defined regions of a surface for a reagent of interest, or for a biological marker or binding agent, such as an antibody or suitable fragment thereof. Alternatively, such a biological molecule may be applied directly to the polymer article as the functional coating.<br>
Microfluidic channels, an example of a micro total analysis system, in which fluids are brought together to react and are subsequently monitored, may be mass-produced by moulding channels into a polymer surface.  One method of introducing the ability to influence and monitor the state of the system is to integrate electronic circuits on the polymer surface, which may be connected to external electronics.  The introduction of means for producing these integrated electronics during the process for producing the polymer channels is desirable.<br>
It has been discovered by the applicants that modelling the temperature of the mould in an injection moulding apparatus during injection of the molten polymer indicates that the molten polymer cools from around 300 oC to 5-10 oC above the mould<br><br>
temperature within 1 Î¼s of contact between the mould and the molten polymer.  The possibility of applying a heat-sensitive material to the surface of a mould, or other cooled shaping surface of a polymer-forming device, and transferring that material intact to the surface of the polymer article, is therefore raised.<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect/ the invention provides a method of providing at least one heat sensitive material on at least part of the surface of a polymer article formed from a heated polymer whose temperature is sufficient to adversely affect the at least one heat sensitive material, wherein: a shaping surface is provided having a smooth surface or an at least partly textured surface;<br>
the at least one heat sensitive material is applied to at least part of the shaping surface, the shaping surface being at a temperature at which the heat sensitive material is not adversely affected;<br>
the heated polymer is brought in contact with the shaping surface;<br>
the heated polymer is formed by the surface shape of the shaping surface; and<br>
the at least one heat sensitive material is transferred from the shaping surface to the polymer surface; and the temperature of the shaping surface is maintained sufficiently low that the at least one heat sensitive material is not substantially adversely affected by heat upon or after contact with the heated polymer.<br>
The at least one heat sensitive material is maintained at a temperature such that it is not more than 30% degraded or denatured by contact with the heated polymer, for example not more than 20% degraded or denatured, or not more than 10% degraded or denatured.  Preferably, the at least one heat sensitive material is not detectably degraded or denatured by the heated polymer.  Preferably, the at least one heat sensitive material has selective binding properties.  Preferably, the<br><br>
selective binding affinity of the at least one heat sensitive material is maintained after contact with the heated polymer.<br>
According to a preferred practice of the invention, the polymer article is formed by injection moulding, said shaping surface forming an internal surface of the mould. Alternatively, a different shaping process is used such as compression moulding or calendering.  The melting temperature for the polymers typically used in injection moulding or calendering processes is generally between 100 oC and 250oC.  A suitable temperature for a melt for injection moulding may therefore be up to 300oC, for example 250oC.  A suitable temperature for a melt to be formed by calendering may be up to 300oC, for example 250oC.<br>
Preferaibly, cooling means cooling the shaping surface maintains the temperature of the shaping surface at or below 30 'C.  This may for instance be a cooling fluid passed through cooling channels in a mould or chilling a calendering roller.<br>
The at least one heat sensitive material is preferably applied to the shaping surface by contact printing, for which one may use a smooth or at least partly textured stamp. Preferred materials for such a stamp include polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).  The stamp may have a smooth stamping surface or this may be textured with a random or systematic pattern of elevated and depressed areas.  Preferably, such texture includes formations having at least one relatively small dimension, such as width.  Such a dimension may for instance be less than 1mm, more preferably less than 100 Î¼m, more preferably less than 10 Î¼m, e.g. less than 1 Î¼m, possibly less than 100 nm.  Such features may form lines or spots, reticulated networks, islands, islands connected by lines, or mixtures thereof.  Spacing between elevated features may be less than 1 mm, more preferably less than 100 Î¼m, more preferably less than 10 Î¼m, e.g. less than 1 Î¼m,   possibly less than 100 nm.<br><br>
Optionally, the at least one heat sensitive material is applied to the shaping surface having an at least partly textured surface such that only elevated parts of at least part of the textured surface are coated with the heat sensitive<br>
material.<br>
A first heat sensitive material may be applied to the whole of the shaping surface-  The first heat sensitive material may be applied by exposing the shaping surface to a solution of the heat sensitive material.  After application of the first heat sensitive material, at least part of the first heat sensitive material may be removed from the shaping surface, suitably by contact of those parts of the first heat sensitive material with a stamp-  The stamp may be similar to the stamps described herein for selective application of materials.<br>
The shaping surface may be at least partly textured, and the at least part of the first heat sensitive material may be removed from at least some elevated parts of the textured shaping surface.<br>
The texturing of the shaping surface may be as described above in relation to stamps.  Accordingly, the surface may be textured with a random or systematic pattern of elevated and depressed areas.  Preferably, such texture includes formations having at least one relatively small dimension, such as width. Such a dimension may for instance be less than 1mm, more preferably less than 100 Î¼m, more preferably less than 10 Î¼m, e.g. less than 1Î¼m, possibly less than 100 nm.  The heights of such features, which may be defined in terms of the distance between the highest and lowest point of the feature, may for<br>
instance be less than 1 Î¼m, preferably less than 500 nm, more preferably less than 250 nm, e.g. less than 220 nm, possibly less than 100 nm.  Such features may form lines or spots, reticulated networks, islands, islands connected by lines, or mixtures thereof.<br><br>
At least a second heat sensitive material may be applied to at least some of the parts of the shaping surface from which the first heat sensitive material has been removed.<br>
Methods are included wherein the shaping surface is at least partly textured, a material that modifies the hydrophilicity of the shaping surface is applied to coat elevated parts of at least some of the textured parts of the shaping surface, and a heat sensitive material is applied to at least part of the shaping surface and adheres selectively to those parts of the shaping surface having the more compatible hydrophilicity.<br>
The at least one heat sensitive material is preferably at least one biomolecule, which may for instance be selected from the group consisting of proteins, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, lipoproteins, polypeptides, polynucleotides, oligopeptides, oligonucleotides or may be an antibody or binding fragment thereof, or may be a cell adhesion promoting reagent such as polylysine.<br>
The biomolecule may include a component of the extracellular matrix or a component of blood, interstitial fluid, or other bodily fluids of mammals, such as fibrinogen, fibrin, fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, members of the collagen family of proteins, albumin, complement factors, or platelets.<br>
Alternatively, the at least one biomolecule includes a component of the cell walls of mammals, plants, bacteria, or fungi, which may be selected from the group consisting of members of the integrin family, members of the<br>
lipopolysaccharide family, S. aureus Protein A and Protein G and their derivatives.<br>
In a second aspect, the invention provides a method of providing at least one material on at least part of the surface of a polymer article formed from a heated polymer, wherein: a shaping surface is provided which is at least partly textured;<br><br>
the at least one material is selectively applied to elevated<br>
parts of the shaping surface by contact printing;<br>
the heated polymer is brought in contact with the shaping<br>
surface;<br>
the heated polymer is formed by the surface shape of the shaping<br>
surface; and<br>
the at least one material is transferred from the shaping<br>
surface to the surface of the polymer article whilst the shaping<br>
surface and the heated polymer are in contact.<br>
All of the features described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention may be used in relation to this second aspect also in so far as they are not incompatible therewith.  Thus, once again, injection moulding, compression moulding and calendering may be used.<br>
The topographical replication efficacy may be modulated by choice of replication process parameters, such as by varying the speed of injection of the molten polymer into the mould, or by spatially selectively varying the heat transport properties of the shaping part surface.  The microscopic topography of the shape part may be replicated with different detail from the macroscopic topography.<br>
The at least one material may comprise a catalytically-active substance, such as a palladium colloid. Catalytically active substances such as this may be suitable for electroless plating of conductive paths or islands.<br>
Preferably, cooling means is provided acting on the shaping surface to maintain the temperature of the shaping surface substantially below that of the polymer being shaped, e.g. at or below 100oC, e.g. at or below 30oC.<br>
The at least one material is preferably applied to the shaping surface by contact printing as described above in relation to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
In preferred methods the at least one material comprises a catalytically active substance, and the method further comprises<br><br>
exposing the catalytically active substance on the polymer article to at least one reagent in order that the catalytically active substance catalyses a reaction.  Preferably, the at least one reagent is in solution.  The catalytically-active substance may be a palladium colloid.<br>
Optionally, the solution of reagents spatially selectively deposits an insoluble product on exposure to the palladium colloid.  The insoluble product may be contained within recessed surface regions of the polymer article formed by contact with the elevated parts of the shaping surface, and may be such that the insoluble product is not recessed from the surrounding surface regions of the polymer article.<br>
The solution of reagents may comprise an inorganic complex which is catalytically decomposed to form an insoluble metal product, such as copper.<br>
The catalytically active substance and the at least one reagent may interact to generate a controlled quantity of a product in a localized area.  Such a product may be toxic, corrosive, or otherwise potentially harmful.<br>
As in connection with the first aspect of the invention, the material applied to the polymer may be at least one biomolecule and all the above description in connection with such biomolecules applies here also.  However, the at least one material may also be a molecule of non-biological origin but exhibiting biologically active properties, such as a non-biological molecule is selected from the group consisting of poly(ethylene glycols), polyacrylamides, and fluorinated polymers.<br>

The invention will be described in more detail with reference to the Figures and Examples.<br>
The contact printing - injection moulding procedure according to an embodiment of the invention is shown schematically in Figure 1.<br><br>
A flexible stamp, made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or other suitable materials, is prepared having desired surface structure.  For example, the material of the stamp may be formed around a silicon master whose surface has been patterned using UV lithography.  Alternatively, an unstructured flat stamp may be formed using a convenient flat surface such as a Petri dish in place of the silicon master.  After curing of the stamp in the desired form, it may be peeled from the master and cut to the required size, for example with a razor blade.<br>
The surface of the flexible stamp may then be coated with the desired material for transfer.  For structured stamps, the structured face of the stamp is immersed in a solution of the desired material; the stamp is left in the solution for a period of time sufficient for transfer of the material to the stamp, typically 10-30 min, before washing with water and drying in a stream of air.  For flat stamps, a suitably-sized drop of the solution of the desired material is placed on the face of the stamp and allowed to remain there for a period of time sufficient for transfer of the material to the stamp, typically 10-30 min.  The stamp is then washed and dried by adding water and spinning the stamp, for example at 2500 rpm.<br>
The stamp is now coated with the desired transfer material, as illustrated in Figure lA, and is ready to be brought into contact with the shim, as in Figure IB.<br>
The shim may be textured or flat, and may form a removable or a permanent part of the mould.  The shim and/or the mould may additionally have macroscopic surface structure, in addition to the surface texture.  For example, the shim and/or mould may be shaped to form a multi-well plate from the polymer, in which the bottoms of the wells are smooth or textured.  In this example, the shaping forming the wells is the macroscopic structure, and the texture of the shim forms the texture of the bottom of the wells, and may be termed the microscopic structure.<br><br>
The face of the stamp bearing the transfer material and the shim are brought into contact for a period of time sufficient for the transfer of the material from the stamp to the shim, typically one minute.  When a structured stamp is used, the material is transferred from the raised parts of the structure only.  When a textured shim is used, the material is transferred only to the raised parts of the shim in contact with the stcimp.  This is illustrated in Figure ID. Examples of combinations of stamp and shim for use in the invention are illustrated in Figure 2: Figure 2A shows a textured stamp in combination with a flat shim, Figure 2B shows a flat stamp in combination with a textured shim, and Figure 2C shows a textured stamp in combination with a textured shim.<br>
Other methods of coating the shim with the desired material may be envisaged.  For example, the whole of the topography of all or part of the shim could be coated in the material by exposing the shim to a solution of the material for an appropriate time period, followed by washing and drying.  The recessed parts of the shim may be coated by coating the whole surface as above, followed by application of a flat adhesive surface to the shim to which the material adheres in preference to the shim.  This removes the material coating the elevated parts of the shim in contact with the adhesive surface.  An example of such an adhesive surface may be a PDMS stamp whose surface has been oxidized by an oxygen-containing plasma; this may be left in contact with the shim for an appropriate time period, for example 1 min.  It may subsequently be desirable to coat the elevated parts of the shim with a second material, for exainple using a structured or flat stamp as described above.  It may be envisaged that a plurality of materials may be applied to the shim in different areas and at different elevations of the surface topography by combination of these techniques.<br>
Once the desired combination of materials has been applied to the shim, the shim is inserted into the mould.  A molten polymer is then introduced into the mould according to the usual<br><br>
injection moulding technique.  This is shown in Figures IE and IF; a schematic diagram of the mould is shown in Figure 3.  The molten polymer adopts the form of the shim at least to an extent.<br>
The extent to which the molten polymer adopts the form of the shim may be varied by altering the injection speed of the molten polymer into the mould.  It is found that the polymer article produced using low injection speeds exhibits low or no microscopic replication of the surface texture of the shim, whilst at higher injection speeds full replication was observed. In both cases, the macroscopic replication was complete.  It may be desirable to alter the microscopic replication, for example to form multi-well plates having a pattern of functional material at the bottom of each well, but no texture on the bottom surface of the well.<br>
The molten polymer is allowed to remain in the mould until it has cooled and set.  This time may be of the order of a minute or less.  After setting, the materials have transferred from the shim to the surface of the polymer according to the pattern and topography with which the materials were placed on the shim.  The polymer article is removed from the mould, and the materials deposited on its surface may be detected by appropriate methods.<br>
It may also be encompassed in the present invention to use a method of forming the polymer other than injection moulding. For example. Figure 4 shows an apparatus for incorporation into a calender, preferably between the heated rollers and the cooling rollers.  The desired material may be transferred to the surface of a shaping roller by an intermediate transfer roller. The transfer roller B may be made from similar materials to those used for the flexible stamps described above, for example PDMS.  Immersion of the surface of the transfer roller B in a solution of the desired material A, followed by contact between the coated surface of the transfer roller B and the shaping roller C, transfers the material to the surface of the shaping<br><br>
roller.  The surfaces of either or both of the shaping roller and the transfer roller may be textured, and so different patterns of the material may be obtained, as described for the injection moulding shim above*<br>
Examples of materials for use in the invention may be biologically active molecules, of either biological or non-biological origin. As many biologically-active molecules' biological activity is destroyed by exposure to high temperatures - for example, proteins are denatured at temperatures above 40oC - the shaping part must be maintained at a temperature of at or less than 30 oC during contact with the heated polymer.  Such compounds may be used to promote or reduce cell adhesion, or may be present in wells used for a particular assay as an assay component.<br>
Alternatively, compounds that modify the surface characteristics of the polymer may be used, such as polymer coatings that reduce or enhance the residence time of a substance on the polymer surface without reacting with that substance.<br>
A catalytic substance may be used as the transfer material, in order to allow further functionalisation of the polymer surface in defined areas, for example electroless deposition of metals catalysed by colloidal particles of tin and/or palladium, or to allow localized production of a desired substance, for example a toxic substance.<br>
A reactive substance may be used as the transfer material, in order to further functionalise the surface in defined areas, such as ferric tosylate deposition for use as a reducing agent to form conducting polymers.<br>
Example 1 - General procedure for injection moulding<br>
Injection moulding was performed on an Engel 25 tonnes machine fitted with a water-cooled mould with a replaceable shim.  The dimensions of the shim were 39 mm x 44 min, with a<br>
300 Î¼.m thickness.  The shim was supported by a highly heat-<br><br>
conducting backplate.  The nickel shims used contained flat areas and 25 1 mm x 1 mm areas having grids of protruding lines spaced equidistantly.  The line width and line spacing were<br>
varied from 3,1 pm to 100 nm.  Lines were elevated 220 nm above the base of the shim.  After application of the media to be transferred, the shim was mounted in the mould and the polymer injected into the mould.  The water cooling was set to the minimum temperature, yielding a mould temperature of 26oC before injection of the molten polymer.  The mould temperature was monitored via a thermistor in the backplate and increased to approximately 30oC during injection of the molten polymer.  The polymer article was removed from the mould after a cooling time of 60 s.<br>
Example 2 - General procedure for contact printing of a shim<br>
The contact printing of a material on to the shim was carried out using flexible stamps made from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) .  Flat PDMS stamps were fabricated by casting and curing the prepolymer components of PDMS (Sylgard 184, Dow Corning, Midland, MI) against a Petri dish.  Structured PDMS stamps were fabricated by casting and curing the prepolymer components of PDMS against a silicon master prepatterned with photoresist. The silicon master was manufactured by spin coating of a negative photoresist (SU-8, MicroChem) onto a silicon wafer followed by UV lithography.  After curing, the stamps were peeled off the master and cut to the required size using a razor blade.  The surface chemistry of the stamps was not modified prior to use.<br>
The desired material was adsorbed on to the surface of the structured stamps by immersion in a solution of the required material for between 10 and 30 min.  The stamps were then rinsed in Millipore water and dried in a stream of air.  Flat stamps were coated by placing a 300 Î¼l drop on the stamp for 10-30 min, followed by washing and drying by spinning off the solution at<br><br>
250 rpm with the addition of 2 ml of Millipore water at the onset of spinning.<br>
After washing and drying, the stamps were carefully placed on the nickel shims and left for 1 min before removal.<br>
Example 3 - Procedure for coating the entire shaping surface with protein<br>
The shape generating surface was defined on a metallic inlay of the mould cavity.  The metallic inlay, made from nickel, was removed from the cavity and immersed in a solution of the material.  Coating by proteins, namely fibronectin or bovine serum albiomin, proceeded by immersion in a 10Î¼g/ml solution of the respective protein in phosphate buffered saline for 30 minutes, followed by immersion of the resulting coated surface three times in phosphate buffered saline.  The final step of the procedure involved drying of the surface in an argon flow.  Other experiments undertaken suggest that the incubation time of 30 min may be reduced to 1 minute with only slight reductions in the amount of protein transferred to the shape generating surface.<br>
Example 4 - Procedure for removing the material selectively from the elevated parts of the shaping surface<br>
A flat material adhesive towards the material coating the shaping surface is brought in contact with that surface and removed again to leave the elevated parts uncoated.  In one example, the shaping surface was made from nickel and coated with fibronectin using immersion deposition.  The flat material used was a poly (dimethylsiloxane) rubber pretreated in an oxygen plasma at 0.5 mbar for 1 min.  The flat r\ibber material was brought in contact with the coated surface for 1 min.  After peeling off the rubber material, no measurable amounts of fibronectin could be detected on the elevated areas of the shaping surface.  In another example, the shaping surface was made from nickel which had been surface modified by the vapour phase of tridecafluorotetrahydrooctyltrichlorosilane at 1 mbar for 1 hour before being homogeneously coated with fibronectin<br><br>
using immersion deposition.  The flat material used for removal of protein from the elevated surface areas was untreated poly (dimethylsiloxane) rubber.  The flat rubber material was left to contact the shaping surface for 1 min, and no measurable amounts of fibronectin could be detected on the elevated surface parts afterwards.<br>
Example 5 - Procedure for applying different media to different elevations of the shaping surface<br>
A shaping surface, for example made from nickel, is homogeneously coated by immersion into solution of one material, for example bovine serum albumin dissolved in phosphate buffered saline. A flat material adhesive, for example<br>
poly(dimethylsiloxane) rubber oxidized in a oxygen-containing plasma, is brought in contact with the coated surface, left for 1 min, and removed.  The uncoated elevated surface parts are subsequently coated by a second material using contact printing with a flat coated staimp using for example fibronectin coated on untreated poly(dimethylsiloxane).<br>
Example 6 - Procedure for modulating the replication efficacy at the microscopic length scale<br>
The replication efficacy was modulated by varying the injection speed of the molten polymer.  A range of microscopic topographical surface patterns were employed. One of the configurations used a shaping surface consisting of 3.1 Î¼m x 3.1 Î¼m 200 nm tall squares separated by 3.1 Î¼m along both perpendicular surface dimensions.  The shaping surface was made of nickel.  In one experimental series, the polymer was Digital Versatile Disc grade polycarbonate with a glass transition temperature of 145 Â°C.  The shaping surface had a temperature of 95Â°Cand the polymer melt was injected into the mould cavity at a temperature of 320 Â°C.  The injection speed was varied from 0.05 m/s to 0.5 m/s.  The resulting polymer replica did not exhibit measurable microscopic replication at the lowest speed, being determined as height differences of less than 1 nm between elevated and recessed areas.  The replication efficacy improved<br><br>
gradually with increasing injection speed until fully replicated structures were found at speeds of more than 0.3 m/s.  In contrast, full replication of the macroscopic shape of the mould cavity into the polymer objects was observed at all investigated injection speeds.<br>
Example 7 - Transfer of fluorescently-labelled IgG to PMMA<br>
The transfer of fluorescently labelled IgG was carried out according to the general procedure using a flat stamp coated<br>
using a solution of 25-50 Î¼g/ml fluorescently labelled IgG (Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Molecular Probes, in Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline) and a shim patterned with<br>
a grid of perpendicular lines of width 3.1 |xm separated by<br>
10 Î¼m,  Injection moulding using the shim printed with IgG was carried out according to the general procedure, with the replica being removed from the mould after a cooling time of 60 s. Fluorescence CLSM microscopy (Zeiss LSM5 Pascal confocal laser scanning microscope, 543 nm excitation line) was used to determine the presence and position of transferred IgGs; the micrograph obtained is shown in Figure 5a. This micrograph clearly illustrates the formation of a pattern of IgGs corresponding to the printed areas of the shim.<br>
Example 8 - Transfer of fluorescently labelled IgG to PMMA<br>
Transfer was carried out as for Example 7 above except<br>
that the lines on the shim were 310 nm wide, spaced by 10 Î¼m. The micrograph obtained is shown in Figure 5b, an AFM image of the surface is shown in Figure 5c, and an AFM line profile is shown in Figure 5d. Again, it is seen that the pattern of IgGs formed on the polymer surface corresponds to that printed onto the shim.<br>
Example 9 - Transfer of fibronectin to polystyrene<br>
The transfer of fibronectin was carried out according to the general procedure using a flat stamp coated using a solution<br>
of 100Î¼g/ml fibronectin (from human plasma, Sigma-Aldrich, in<br><br>
Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline) and a shim patterned with<br>
a grid of perpendicular lines having a width of 1 Î¼m and a<br>
spacing of 10 Î¼m. Injection moulding was carried out as for the general procedure, with the polymer being removed from the mould after 60 s.  The polymer surface was then blocked with human<br>
serum albumin (HSA; 20 Î¼g/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) , stained with a<br>
primary antibody (25-50 Î¼g/ml monoclonal anti-fibronectin antibody produced in mouse, Sigma-Aldrich) and then a fluorescently labelled secondary antibody (10-20Î¼g/ml Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L), Molecular Probes).  A fluorescence CLSM micrograph of the labelled transferred fibronectin is shown in Figure 6a.  This indicates that fibronectin is transferred according to the pattern printed on the shim and is able to bind the primary antibody after transfer.<br>
Example 10 - Transfer of fibronectin to polystyrene<br>
Transfer, moulding and staining were carried out as for Example 9, except that the shim used was patterned with a grid<br>
of lines of width 100 nm and spacing 10 Î¼m. The fluorescence micrograph of the polymer surface is shown in Figure 6b. Again, the fibronectin is transferred according to the shim pattern and is able to bind the primary antibody.<br>
Example 11 - Transfer of fibronectin to polystyrene<br>
Transfer, moulding and staining were carried out as for Example 9, except that the shim used was patterned with a grid<br>
of lines of width 100 nm and spacing 3.1 Î¼m. The fluorescence micrograph is shown in Figure 6c. Again, the fibronectin is transferred according to the pattern of the shim and is able to bind the primary antibody.<br>
Example 12 - Transfer of fibronectin to polycarbonate<br>
Transfer was carried out according to Example 9, except that the stamp was structured with protruding 40Î¼m.  squares<br><br>
separated by 40 Î¼m, elevated by 16 Î¼m relative to the base of the stamp, and the stamping was carried out partially on the patterned section of the shim and partially on the flat section of the shim.  Injection moulding was carried out according to the general procedure, with the polymer being removed from the mould after a cooling time of 60 s.  The polymer surface was blocked for 4 days with HSA at 4 C according to the method of Example 9.  The fibronectin was stained as in Example 9, and the fluorescent micrograph of the polymer surface is shown in Figure 7a.  Bright squares are seen where the squares of fibronectin were printed onto the flat areas of the shim; substructure of gridlines is visible where the squares of fibronectin were printed on to the patterned areas of the shim.  The proteins are shown not to be mobile on the surface as the pattern is clear after 4 days in HSA.  The pattern obtained also shows that.the grid patterns of Figure 6 were not obtained as a result of an artefact of the topography of the shim or polymer, such as preferred binding in the grooves.<br>
Example 13 - Transfer of fibronectin to polystyrene<br>
Transfer, moulding and staining were carried out according to Example 12, except that the stamp was printed only onto the patterned regions of the shim, and the polymer surface was not blocked with HSA for 4 d before immunostaining.  The fluorescence micrograph of the polymer surface is shown in Figure 7b.<br>
Example 14 - Cell adherence of HaCat on polystyrene influenced by fibronectin<br>
Transfer of a 20:1 mixture of fibronectin and fluorescently-labelled IgG was carried out according to the<br>
general procedure, using a stamp structured with 100 Î¼m squares<br>
separated by 100 Î¼m and elevated 16 Î¼m relative to the base of the stamp, and a flat shim.  The stamp was coated in a solution<br>
of 20:1 fibronectin:IgG containing 100 Î¼g/ml fibronectin. Injection moulding was carried out using the printed shim as in<br><br>
the general procedure, and the polymer replica was removed from the mould after a cooling time of 60 s.  The surface of the polymer replica was then treated with HaCat cells.  A fluorescence micrograph of the polymer surface after cell culturing is shown in Figure 8a {dark areas correspond to fluorescently labelled IgG) and a reflection micrograph of the surface is shown in Figure 8b (dark spots correspond to HaCat cells).  94% of the adhered cells were located within the protein coated areas, and so transferred fibronectin was shown to retain the ability to induce cell adhesion.<br>
Example 15 - Transfer of Pd colloid on to polypropylene<br>
Transfer was carried out using a flat PDMS stamp onto which was dripped a palladium colloid suspension whilst the stamp was spun at 10000 rpm.  The shim was patterned with the pattern of an interdigitated array by electron beam lithography:<br>
a 300Î¼m thick blank nickel shim was spin coated with FOx-14 (Dow Corning) ,   pre-exposure baked at 180 Â°C  for 1 h, and the pattern written on using a scanning electron microscope<br>
(modified Zeiss DSM 960, 100 Î¼C/cm2) and developed.  The stamp and shim were brought into contact, and an AFM image of a flat part of the shim and a corresponding line profile is shown in Figure 9.  The polypropylene melt (Inspire H-710, Dow Plastics) is injected into the mould containing the shim, and the polymeric replica released from the mould 15 s after injection. The replica is then placed in a bath of copper sulphate, Rochelle salt and water, and metallic copper is deposited from the solution on the areas of the polymer onto which the Pd colloid has been transferred.  A reflection microscopy image of the replica is shown in Figure 10, wherein the light areas are copper coated and the dark areas are uncoated polymer.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
