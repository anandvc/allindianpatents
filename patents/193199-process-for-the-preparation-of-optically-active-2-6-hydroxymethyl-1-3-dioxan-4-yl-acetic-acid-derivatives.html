The present invention relates to a process for producing optically active 2-[6-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-dioxan-4-yl]acetic acid derivatives which are of value as intermediates of drugs, particularly intermediates of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.<br><br>
For the production of a 2-[6-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-dioxan-4-yl]acetic acid derivative, the following processes are known.<br>
(1)	A process starting with 3-hydroxy-y-butyrolactone to<br>
synthesize a 3,5,6-trihydroxyhexanoic acid ester derivative<br>
via a 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid ester derivative (Japanese<br>
Kokai Publication Hei-4-173767).<br>
(2)	A process starting with 3,4-dihydroxybutyronitrile<br>
acetonide to synthesize a 3,5,6-trihydroxyhexanoic acid ester<br>
derivative via a 3,5-dihydroxyhexanoic acid ester derivative<br>
(Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-2-262537).<br>
(3)	A process starting with a 4-chloroacetoacetic acid ester<br>
to synthesize a 3, 5, 6-trihydroxyhexanoic acid ester derivative<br>
via conversion to a benzyloxy derivative, reduction and chain<br>
extension (Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-6-65226).<br>
(4)	A process starting with a 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyric acid<br>
ester to synthesize a 3,5,6-trihydroxyhexanoic acid ester<br>
derivative through chain extension, reduction, etc. (USP<br>
5278313).<br>
(5)	A process starting with malic acid to synthesize a<br>
3, 5, 6-trihydroxyhexanoic acid ester via a 2, 4-dihydroxyadipic acid derivative (Japanese Kokai Publication Hei-4-69355).<br>
However, those processes involve reactions at a super-low temperature in the neighborhood of -80°C (1, 2, 4, 5) or a<br><br>
hydrogenation reaction at a high pressure of 100 kg/cm2 (3), thus requiring the use of special reaction equipment. Moreover, the processes involve the use of costly reagents in some stage or other and, therefore, none of them is an efficient process for commercial-scale production.<br>
The prior art process (4), for instance, comprises reacting a 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutyric acid ester with an enolate of tert-butyl acetate using costly lithium hexamethyl disylazide at a super-low temperature of -78°C in the first step and performing a stereoselective reduction using costly diethylmethoxyborane and sodium borohydride, again at a super-low temperature of -78°C, in the second step.  This process further involves an acetoxylation reaction with costly tetra-n-butylammonium acetate in the costly solvent 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention, developed in the above state of the art, has for its object to provide an expedient process for producing an optically active 2-[6-(hydroxymethyl)-1,3-dioxan-4-yl]acetic acid derivative of the following general formula (I) from inexpensive starting materials without using any special equipment such as that required for super-low temperature reactions.<br><br>

of 6 to 12 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group of 7 to 12 carbon atoms, and R4 and R5 may be conjoined each other to form a ring. As the result of intensive investigations made in light of the above state of the art, the inventors of the present invention have developed an expedient process for producing an optically active 2-[6- (hydroxymethyl)-1,3-dioxan-4-yl]acetic acid derivative of the following general formula (I):<br><br>

wherein R1 and X1 are respectively as defined above,<br>

In this step, an enolate prepared by permitting either a base or a metal having a valency of 0 to act upon an acetic ester derivative of the following general formula (II):<br>

at a temperature of not less than -30oC to produce a (5S)-configured hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative of the following general formula (IV):<br><br>
Generally when a reaction involving the enolate of an acetic ester or the like is conducted under non-super-low-temperature condition, e.g. at not less than -30°C, the self-condensation of the enolate proceeds predominantly to considerably detract from the conversion rate of the objective reaction. However, by the following procedure developed by the<br><br>
present inventors, the self-condensation of the acetic ester enolate can be minimized so that the objective reaction can be conducted with good yield.<br>
In the hydroxybutyric acid derivative to be used in step (1)  namely a compound of the following general formula (III) :<br><br>
the configuration of the 3-position is (S) and R2 is, for example, an alkyl group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, an aryl group of 6 to 12 carbon atoms or an aralkyl group of 7 to 12 carbon atoms, thus as a specific example, there can be mentioned methyl, ethyl, i-propyl, tert-butyl, n-octyl, phenyl, naphthyl, p-methoxyphenyl and p-nitrobenzyl, among others.

The metal having a valency of 0 which can be used in the preparation of said enolate in step (1) includes zinc, magnesium, tin, etc. and is preferably zinc or magnesium.<br>
The amount of use of the metal having a valency of 0 in step (1) is 1 to 20 molar equivalents, preferably 2 to 8 molar equivalents, relative to the hydroxybutyric acid derivative.<br>
The solvent which can be used in step (1) may for example be an aprotic organic solvent. The organic solvent mentioned above includes hydrocarbon series solvents, such as benzene.<br><br>
toluene, n-hexane, cyclohexane, etc.; ether series solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,4-dioxane, methyl t-butyl ether, dimethoxyethane, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, etc.; halogen-containing solvents such as methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, etc.; and aprotic polar solvents such as dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, hexamethylphosphorotriamide, etc., among others. These solvents can be used each alone or in a combination of two or more species.

Polyether series solvents may each be used as a sole solvent or an additive to a different reaction solvent. The addition amount in the latter case may be 1 to 10 molar equivalents relative to the hydroxybutyric acid derivative. The solvent which is particularly preferred is dimethoxyethane.<br>
The reaction temperature for step (1) is preferably -30°C to 100°C, more preferably -10°C to 60°C.<br>
In step (1) , while the order of addition of reactants may be arbitrary, the hydroxybutyric acid derivative may be treated with the base beforehand. Preferably, it is treated with the base and the magnesium compound beforehand.<br>
As the preferred base, there can be mentioned metal hydrides and lithium amides.<br>
As the preferred magnesium compound, there can be mentioned magnesium chloride and magnesium bromide.<br>
The base and the magnesium compound need not be independent compounds but a magnesium-containing base can be employed.<br>
As the preferred magnesium-containing base, there can be mentioned Grignard reagents such as methylmagnesium bromide.<br><br>
i-propylmagnesium chloride, tert-butylmagnesium chloride, etc. and magnesium amides such as magnesium chloride diisopropylamide, magnesium bromide diisopropylamide, magnesium iodide diisopropylamide, magnesium chloride dicyclohexylamide and so forth.<br>
At the pretreatment of the hydroxybutyric acid derivative, a pretreatment of a mixed solution of the hydroxybutyric acid derivative and acetic ester derivative is allowed. After this pretreatment, the reaction can be advantageously carried out by adding the base, such as a lithium amide, e.g. lithium amide, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium dicyclohexylamide or lithium hexamethyldisilazide, or a magnesium amide, or a solution of the base dropwise.<br>
The proportion of the base for use in the pretreatment is 0.01 to 3 molar equivalents, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 molar equivalents, relative to the hydroxybutyric acid derivative.<br>
The proportion of the magnesium compound for use in the pretreatment is 0.1 to 10 molar equivalents, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 molar equivalents, relative to the hydroxybutyric acid derivative.<br>
The proportion of the magnesium-containing base for use in the pretreatment is 0.01 to 3 molar equivalents, preferably 0.5 to 1.5 molar equivalents, relative to the hydroxybutyric acid derivative.<br>
The proportion of the base to be reacted after the pretreatment is 1 to 20 molar equivalents, preferably 2 to 8 molar equivalents, relative to the hydroxybutyric acid-<br>
Thus, this step (1) can be advantageously carried out by treating the hydroxybutyric acid derivative with a base and a magnesium derivative in the first place and then causing a base to act on the same in the presence of an acetic ester derivative.<br>
As an alternative, the hydroxybutyric acid derivative may be pretreated with a Grignard reagent and, then, reacted with an enolate prepared by permitting a metal having a valency of 0 to act on an acetic ester derivative.<br><br>
After completion of the reaction in step (1) , the reaction product can recovered from the reaction mixture by the routine after-treatment. For example, the reaction mixture after completion of reaction is mixed with the common inorganic or organic acid, e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid or citric acid, and the mixture is then extracted with the common extraction solvent, e.g. ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, methylene chloride, toluene or hexane. From the extract obtained, the reaction solvent and extraction solvent are distilled off by heating under reduced pressure etc. isolate the objective compound. The product thus obtained is a substantially pure compound but may be further purified by a conventional technique such as recrystallization, fractional distillation, column chromatography or the like. Step (2)<br>
In this step, the hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative obtained in step (1), namely a (5S)-configured hydroxyoxohexanoic derivative of the following general formula (IV) ;<br><br>
, is subjected to the reduction with a strain of microrganism to provide a (3R,5S)-configured dihydroxyhexanoic acid derivative of the following general formula (V).<br><br>
In the case of the stereoselective reduction of the<br><br>
carbonyl group of such a hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative, the technique is generally adapted in which the reduction reaction is carried out with a hydride series reducing agent such as sodium borohydride in the presence of an alkylborane at a super-low temperature (e.g. US 5278313).<br>
The inventors of the present invention developed a microbiological reduction technology by which a hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative can be reduced at low cost with good stereoselectivity at a non-super-low temperature.<br>
The microorganism capable of reducing a hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative to a dihydroxyhexanoic acid derivative, which is for use in this step (2) , can be selected by the method described below.  For example, a 500-mL Sakaguchi flask is charged with 50 mL of Medium A (pH 6.5) comprising 5% of glucose, 0.5% of peptone, 0.2% of potassium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.1% of dipotassium hydrogen phosphate, 0.02% of magnesium sulfate and 0.1% of yeast extract. After sterilization, the flask is inoculated with a strain of microorganism and incubated under shaking at 30°C for 2 to 3 days.  The cells are harvested by centrifugation and suspended' in 25 mL of a phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 to 0.5% of tert-butyl (5S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate and 5% of glucose, and the resulting suspension is shaken in a 500-mL Sakaguchi flask at 30°C for 2 to 3 days. After completion of the conversion reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted with one volume of ethyl acetate and the extract is analyzed for tert-butyl 6-chloro-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate by high performance liquid chromatography [column: Nakalai Tesque's Cosmocil 5CN-R (4.6 mm x 250 mm), eluent: 1 mM phosphoric acid/water:acetonitrile = 5:1, flow rate: 0.7 mL/min., detection at 210 nm, column temperature 30°C, elution time [tert-butyl (3S,5S)-6-chloro-3, 5-dihydroxyhexanoate: 12.5 min.; terty-butyl (3R,5S)-6-chloro-3, 5-dihydroxyhexanoate: 13.5 min., tert-butyl (5S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate: 17 min.].<br><br>
The bacterial strain capable of reducing a hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative to a dihydroxyhexanoic acid derivative, which can be used in step (2), can be selected by the method described below.  For example, a large-sized test tube is charged with 7 mL of Medium B (pH 7.0) comprising 1% of meat extract, 1% of polypeptone, 0.5% of yeast extract and 0.5% of glucose. After sterilization, the test tube is inoculated with a test strain and shake culture is carried out at 30°C for 1/2 day. The cells are harvested by centrifugation and suspended in 0.5 mL of a phosphate buffer solution containing 0.1 to 0.5% of tert-butyl (5S)-6-chloro-5-hydroxy-3-oxohexanoate and glucose. This suspension is shaken in a 10-mL stoppered test tube at 30°C for 1-2 days. After completion of the conversion reaction, the reaction mixture is extracted by adding one volume of ethyl acetate and the extract is analyzed for tert-butyl 6-chloro-3,5-dihydroxyhexanoate by high performance liquid chromatography.<br>
As the strains of microorganism which can be used in the practice of this invention, there can be mentioned those<br><br><br><br>
others. Those microorganisms can be generally obtained, free of cost or at cost, from culture collections which are readily accessible. Or they may be isolated from the natural kingdom. Furthermore, those microorganisms may be subjected to mutation to derive strains having the more favorable characters for the present reaction.<br><br>

For example, as sources of carbon, there can be used various sugars such as glucose, sucrose, maltose, etc.; organic acids such as lactic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, propionic acid, etc.; alcohols such as ethanol, glycerol, etc.; hydrocarbons such as paraffin etc.; oils such as soybean oil, rapeseedoil, etc.; and various mixtures thereof. As sources of nitrogen there can be used a variety of nitrogenous substances such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, urea, yeast extract, meat extract, peptone, and corn steep liquor, among others. The culture medium may be further supplemented<br><br>
with inorganic salts, vitamins and other nutrients.<br>
Culture of microorganisms can be generally carried out under routine conditions, for example within the range of pH 4.0 to 9.5 at a temperature 20 to 45°C aerobically for 10 to 96 hours. In permitting a strain of microorganism to act on the hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative, generally the culture broth obtained can be submitted as it is to the reaction but a concentrate of the broth can also be employed. Moreover, in case some component in the culture broth is suspected to adversely affect the reaction, the cells separated by, for example, centrifugation of the broth can be used as such or after further processing.<br>
The product available after said further processing is not particularly restricted but there can be mentioned dried cells which can be obtained by dehydration with acetone or diphosphorous pentoxide or drying over a desiccant or with the draft air of a fan, the product of surfactant treatment, the product of bacteriolytic enzyme treatment, immobilized cells, and a cell-free extract obtainable from disrupted cells. A still further alternative comprises purifying the enzyme catalyzing a chiral reduction reaction from the culture broth and employ the purified enzyme.<br>
In conducting the reduction reaction, the substrate hydroxyoxohexanoic acid derivative may be added ^n bloc at initiation of the reaction or in several installments as the reaction proceeds.<br>
The reaction temperature is generally 10 to 60°C, preferably 20 to 40°C, and the reaction pH is 2.5 to 9, preferably 5 to 9.<br>
The concentration of the microbes in the reaction system can be judiciously selected according to the ability of the strain to reduce the substrate. The substrate concentration of the reaction system is preferably 0.01 to 50% (w/v), more preferably 0.1 to 30%.<br>
The reaction is generally carried out under shaking or<br><br>
under aeration and stirring. The reaction time setting is selected according to the substrate concentration, the concentration of the microbes, and other reaction conditions. It is generally preferable to set various conditions so that the reaction will go to completion in 2 to 168 hours.<br>
For the purpose of accelerating the reduction reaction, an energy source, such as glucose or ethanol, can be added at the amount of 1 to 30% to the reaction mixture with advantage. Moreover, the reaction can be accelerated by adding a coenzyme, such as reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) or reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), which is known to be generally necessary for biological reduction systems in general. Thus, such a coenzyme may be directly added to the reaction mixture or, alternatively, a reaction system giving rise to NADH or NADPH and an oxidized-form coenzyme may be added together to the reaction mixture.  For example, a reaction system in which formate dehydrogenase reduces NAD to NADH when carbon dioxide and water are produced from formic acid or a reaction system in which glucose dehydrogenase reduces NAD or NADP to NADH or NADPH when gluconolactone is produced from glucose can be utilized.  It is also useful to add a surfactant such as Triton (Nakalai-Tesque) , Span (Kanto Chemical) or Tween (Nakalai-Tesque) to the reaction system. Furthermore, for the purpose of obviating the inhibition of the reaction by the substrate and/or the reduction product alcohol, a water-insoluble organic solvent such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, isopropyl ether, toluene or the like can be added to the reaction system. Moreover, for enhancing the solubility of the substrate, a water-soluble organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran or dimethyl sulfoxide can be added.<br>
The reduction product dihydroxyhexanoic acid derivative can be harvested directly from the culture broth or isolated from harvested cells by extraction with a solvent such as ethyl acetate, toluene or the like, followed by removal of the solvent.<br><br>
The product may be further purified by recrystallization^ silica gel column chromatography or the like procedure to provide the dihydroxyhexanoic acid derivative of higher purity. Step (3)<br>
