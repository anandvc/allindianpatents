If according to the invention a compound of general formula I is obtained which contains an amino, alkylamino or imino group, this may be converted by acylation, cyanation or sulphonylation into a corresponding acyl, cyano or sulphonyl compound of general formula I, the acylating agents being for example isocyanate, carbamoyl chloride, carboxylic acid halide, carboxylic acid anhydride and carboxylic acids with activating agents such as N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or O-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-N,N,N'N'-tetramethyluronium-tetrafluoroborate, the sulphonylating agents being sulphonyl halides and the cyanating agents being chlorine or bromocyanogen, and/or<br>

In the reactions described hereinbefore, any reactive groups present such as hydroxy, carboxy or imino groups may be protected during the reaction by conventional protecting groups which are cleaved again after the reaction.<br>
For example, a protecting group for a hydroxy group may be a trimethylsilyl, acetyl, trityl, benzyl or tetrahydropyranyl group.<br>
Protecting groups for an amino, alkylamino or imino group may be a formyl, acetyl, trifluoroacetyl, ethoxycarbonyl, tert.butoxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, benzyl, methoxybenzyl or 2,4-dimethoxybenzyl group, for example.<br>

' Moreover, the compounds of general formula I obtained may be resolved into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers, as mentioned hereinbefore. Thus, for example, cis/trans mixtures may be resolved into their cis and trans isomers, and compounds with at least one optically active carbon atom may be separated into their enantiomers.<br>
Thus, for example, the cis/trans mixtures may be resolved by chromatography into the cis and trans isomers thereof, the compounds of general formula I obtained which occur as racemates may be separated by methods known per se (cf. Allinger N. L. and Eliel E. L. in "Topics in Stereochemistry", Vol. 6, Wiley Interscience, 1971) into their optical antipodes and compounds of general formula I with at least 2 asymmetric carbon atoms may be resolved into their diastereomers on the basis of their physical-chemical differences using methods known per se, e.g. by chromatography and/or fractional crystallisation, and, if these compounds are obtained in racemicform, they may subsequently be resolved into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
The enantiomers are preferably separated by column separation on chiral phases or by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent or by reacting with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives such as e.g. esters or amides with the racemic compound, particularly acids and the activated derivatives or alcohols thereof, and separating the diastereomeric mixture of salts or derivatives thus obtained, e.g. on the basis of their differences in solubility, whilst the free antipodes may be released from the pure diastereomeric salts or derivatives by the action of suitable agents. Optically active acids in common use are e.g. the D- and L-forms of tartaric acid or dibenzoyltartaric acid, di-o-tolyltartaric acid, malic acid, mandelic acid, camphorsulphonic acid, glutamic acid, aspartic acid or quinic acid. An optically active alcohol may be for example (+) or (-)-menthol and an optically active acyl group in amides, for example, may be a (+)-or (-)-menthyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Furthermore, the compounds of formula I may be converted into the salts thereof, particularly for pharmaceutical use into the physiologically acceptable<br>
salts with inorganic or organic acids. Acids which may be used for this purpose include for example hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
The compounds of general formulae II to I used as starting materials are known from the literature in some cases or may be obtained by methods known from the literature (cf. Examples I to XXII) or the methods described hereinbefore, optionally with the additional use of protecting groups (e.g. compounds of formula IV or VII and VIII).<br>
As already mentioned hereinbefore, the compounds of general formula I according to the invention and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof have valuable pharmacological properties, particularly an inhibiting effect on signal transduction mediated by the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGF-R), whilst this may be achieved for example by inhibiting ligand bonding, receptor dimerisation or tyrosine kinase itself. It is also possible that the transmission of signals to components located further down is blocked.<br>
The biological properties of the new compounds were investigated as follows:<br>
The inhibition of human EGF-receptor kinase was determined using the cyto-plasmic tyrosine kinase domain (methionine 664 to alanine 1186 based on the sequence published in Nature 309 (1984), 418). For this the protein was expressed in Sf9 insect cells as GST fusion protein using the Baculovirus expression system.<br>
The enzyme activity was measured in the presence or absence of the test compounds in serial dilutions.   The polymer pEY (4:1) obtained from SIGMA was used as the substrate. Biotinylated pEY (bio-pEY) was added as the tracer substrate. 100 ul of reaction solution contained 10 ul of the inhibitor in 50% DMSO, 20 pi of the substrate solution (200 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM magnesium acetate, 2.5 mg/ml poly(EY), 5 ug/ml bio-pEY) and 20 ul of enzyme preparation. The enzyme reaction was started by the addition of 50 ul<br>
of a 100 uM ATP solution in 10 mM of magnesium chloride. The dilution of the enzyme preparation was adjusted so that the incorporation of phosphate in the bio-pEY was linear in terms of time and quantity of enzyme. The enzyme preparation was diluted in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 130 mM common salt, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT and 10% glycerol.<br>
The enzyme assays were carried out at ambient temperature over a period of 30 minutes and ended by the addition of 50 ul of a stopping solution (250 mM EDTA in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4). 100 ul were placed on a streptavidine-coated microtitre plate and incubated for 60 minutes at ambient temperature. Then the plate was washed with 200 ul of a wash solution (50 mM Tris, 0.05% Tween 20). After the addition of 100 ul of an HRPO-labelled anti-PY antibody (PY20H Anti-PTyr:HRP made by Transduction Laboratories, 250 ng/ml) the preparation was incubated for 60 minutes. Then the microtitre plate was washed three times with 200 ul of wash solution. The samples were then combined with 100 ul of a TMB-peroxidase solution (A:B = 1:1, Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories). After 10 minutes the reaction was stopped. The extinction was measured at OD45onm with an ELISA reader. All the results were measured three times.<br>
The data were adapted by iterative calculation using an analytical pogramme for sigmoidal curves (Graph Pad Prism Version 3.0) with a variable Hill pitch. All the iterative data produced had a correlation coefficient of more than 0.9 and the upper and lower values of the curves showed a spread of at least a factor of 5. The active substance concentration which inhibits the activity of EOF receptor kinase by 50% (IC50) was derived from the curves.<br>
The following results were obtained:<br>

I ne compounds of general formula I according to the invention thus inhibit signal transduction by tyrosine kinases, as demonstrated by the example of the human EGF receptor, and are therefore useful for treating pathophysiological processes caused by hyperfunction of tyrosine kinases. These are e.g. benign or malignant tumours, particularly tumours of epithelial and neuroepithelial origin, metastasisation and the abnormal proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (neoangiogenesis).<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also useful for preventing and treating diseases of the airways and lungs which are accompanied by increased or altered production of mucus caused by stimulation by tyrosine kinases, e.g. in inflammatory diseases of the airways such as chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis, allergic or non-allergic rhinitis or sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, a1-antitrypsin deficiency, or coughs, pulmonary emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis and hyperreactive airways.<br>
The compounds are also suitable for treating diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and bile duct and gall bladder which are associated with disrupted activity of the tyrosine kinases, such as may be found e.g. in chronic inflammatory changes such as cholecystitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and ulcers in the gastrointestinal tract or such as may occur in diseases of the gastrointestinal tract which are associated with increased secretions, such as Menetrier's disease, secreting adenomas and protein loss syndrome.<br>
In addition, the compounds of general formula I and the physiologically acceptable salts thereof may be used to treat other diseases caused by abnormal function of tyrosine kinases, such as e.g. epidermal hyperproliferation (psoriasis), benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH), inflammatory processes, diseases of the immune system, hyperproliferation of haematopoietic cells, the treatment of nasal polyps, etc.<br>
By reason of their biological properties the compounds according to the invention may be used on their own or in conjunction with other pharmacologically active compounds, for example in tumour therapy, in monotherapy or in conjunction with other anti-tumour therapeutic agents, for example in combination with topoisomerase inhibitors (e.g. etoposide), mitosis inhibitors (e.g. vinblastine), compounds which interact with nucleic acids (e.g. cis-platin, cyclophosphamide, adriamycin), hormone antagonists (e.g. tamoxifen), inhibitors of metabolic processes (e.g. 5-FU etc.), cytokines (e.g. interferons), antibodies, etc. For treating respiratory tract diseases, these compounds may be used on their own or in conjunction with other therapeutic agents for the airways, such as substances with a secretolytic (e.g. ambroxol, N-acetylcysteine), broncholytic (e.g. tiotropium or ipratropium orfenoterol, salrneterol, salbutamol) and/or anti-inflammatory activity (e.g. theophylline or glucocorticoids). For treating diseases in the region of the gastrointestinal tract, these compounds may also be administered on their own or in conjunction with substances having an effect on motility or secretion. These combinations may be administered either simultaneously or sequentially.<br>
These compounds may be administered either on their own or in conjunction with other active substances by intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal or intranasal route, by inhalation or transdermally or orally, whilst aerosol formulations are particularly suitable for inhalation.<br>
For pharmaceutical use the compounds according to the invention are generally used for warm-blooded vertebrates, particularly humans, in doses of 0.01-100 mg/kg of body weight, preferably 0.1-15 mg/kg. For administration they are formulated with one or more conventional inert carriers and/or diluents, e.g. with corn starch, lactose, glucose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, citric acid, tartaric acid, water, water/ethanol, water/glycerol, water/sorbitol, water/polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, stearyl alcohol, carboxymethylcellulose or fatty substances such as hard fat or suitable mixtures thereof in conventional galenic preparations such as plain or coated tablets, capsules, powders, suspensions, solutions, sprays or suppositories.<br>
