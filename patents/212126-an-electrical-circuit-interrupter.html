BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The subject matter of this invention is related to circuit interrupters generally<br>
and more particularly to accessory modules.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
The present invention provides an improvement over the invention of<br>
U.S. patent 4,503,408 issued March 5, 1985 to Mrenna et al entitled "Molded<br>
Case Circuit Breaker Apparatus Having Trip Bar With Flexible Armor<br>
Interconnection" which is assigned at this time to the assignee of the present<br>
application and which is incorporated by reference herein. Accessories for<br>
molded case circuit breakers have been known for a long time. Generally in the<br>
past the accessories have been mounted externally of the internal portion of the<br>
circuit breaker. An example of such an accessory is found in U.S. patent<br>
4,595,812 issued June 17, 1986 to Tamaru et al entitled "Circuit Interrupter With<br>
Detachable Optional Accessories" An example of an internally mounted<br>
 accessory can be found in co-pending application serial number 08/864,104 (96-<br>
PDC-547).<br>
However, when circuit interruption takes place, the gases generated could<br>
tend to propel the accessory away from its static location within the case, thus<br>
threatening the structural integrity of the circuit interrupter. It would be<br>
advantageous, therefore, if means could be found to secure the module in the<br>
housing in a manner which would allow easy removable when desired.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention an electrical circuit interrupter has a<br>
housing base having a first locking opening therein. A module useful for performing<br>
a desirable function is deposed within that housing base. The module has a second<br>
locking device which is complimentary with the first locking opening. The first and<br>
second locking devices cooperate with each other to secure the module to the<br>
housing base. The circuit breaker also has an operating mechanism and first and<br>
second main contacts disposed therein for opening and closing. In another<br>
embodiment of the invention that housing base has a recess therein, the recess<br>
having a locking opening therein. The aforementioned module has a locking<br>
protrusion which is complimentary with the locking opening. The other parts of the<br>
circuit breaker interrupter are basically the same. In another embodiment of the<br>
invention, the locking protrusion is flexible and may contain a longitudinal slot to<br>
accommodate flexion. In still another embodiment of the invention, the module may<br>
have a tab attached thereto which may be tugged upon to pull the module from the<br>
case when it is desired to remove the module. In still another embodiment of the<br>
invention, a secondary cover is placed over the module once it is locked in place<br>
within the housing base.<br>

Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring now to the drawings and Figures 1 and 2 in particular, there is<br>
shown a prior art molded case circuit breaker 10. Molded case circuit breaker 10<br>
includes a lower base portion 14 mechanically interconnected with a primary<br>
cover 18. Disposed on top of the primary cover 18 is an auxiliary or secondary<br>
cover 22. The secondary cover 22 may be removed from the circuit breaker rendering some internal portions of the circuit breaker available for maintenance<br>
and the like without disassembling the entire circuit breaker. In particular, the secondary cover 22 may shield auxiliary devices or modules such as under-<br>
voltage relays, bell alarms, shunt trips and auxiliary switches. Holes or openings<br>
26 are provided in the secondary cover 22 for accepting screws for fastening the<br>
auxiliary or secondary cover 22 to the primary cover 18. Additional holes 30<br>
which feed through the auxiliary cover 22, the primary cover 18 and the base 14<br>
are provided for bolting the entire circuit breaker assembly onto a wall, into a<br>
DIN rail back panel or into a load center or the like. The primary cover has a<br>
recess 18 therein for receiving a drop-in module as will be described hereinafter.<br>
The auxiliary cover 22 includes an auxiliary cover handle opening 34. The<br>
primary or main cover 18 includes a primary cover handle opening 38. There is<br>
provided a handle 42 which protrudes through the aforementioned auxiliary cover<br>
handle opening 34 and the primary cover handle opening 38. The handle 42 is<br>
utilized in the normal manner to open and close the contacts of the circuit breaker<br>
manually and to reset the circuit breaker when it has been tripped. It may also be<br>
provided as an indication of the status of the circuit breaker, that is whether the<br>
circuit breaker is ON, OFF or TRIPPED disposition. There are also shown three<br>
load conductor openings 46 which shield and protect load terminals 50 (not<br>
shown). The circuit breaker depicted is a three-phase circuit breaker. However,<br>
the invention is not limited to three-phase operation.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3 there is shown a drop-in module 50. Drop-in<br>
module 50 may comprise two or more snap together portions 52 and 54. The<br>
bottom most portion of modular element 50 comprises a locking protrusion 56.<br>
Locking protrusion 56 may include a widened base 58 which is integral with the<br>
bottom portions 59A and 59B of the sections 52 and 54 respectively. There is<br>
also provided on the locking protrusion 56 a central locking bulge 60 which<br>
tapers downwardly to a leader 62. In one embodiment of the invention the<br>
locking protrusion 56 is made flexible to accommodate insertion into a locking<br>
opening as will be described hereinafter. The flexibility may be provided by the<br>
inherit resiliency of the material of the protrusion 56 and one or more<br>
longitudinal slots 64 in the protrusion 56. In this embodiment of the invention<br>
there are four non-limiting slots 64, two of which 64A and 64B, roughly align<br>
with the dividing line region 59C between the case portion 52 and the case<br>
portion 54.<br>
In that manner half of the locking protrusion 56 may be constructed when<br>
the module or case portion 52 is being constructed and the other half may be<br>
constructed as part of the construction of the modular case portion 54. There<br>
may also be provided a pull tab 68 having a region 70 for attachment to the<br>
module 50 and a region 72 which may be tugged upon or pulled in order to<br>
remove the shunt trip case or module 50 from its locked-in position in the circuit,<br>
breaker in a manner which will be described hereinafter. Pull tab 68 may be<br>
attached to the module 50 by way of holes or opening 74 in region 70 through<br>
which protrusions 74A in the section 52 of the module 50 may protrude. In this<br>
embodiment of the invention the module 50 represents a case for a shunt trip<br>
apparatus of the kind described in co-pending application serial no 08/864,104<br>
(96-PDC-547).<br>
Referring now to Figure 4 the combination auxiliary switch bell alarm<br>
module 90 is depicted. In particular, it may comprise two or more joinable<br>
sections 326 and 94 which are joined together to form the module 90 and which<br>
are lockably inserted into the circuit breaker 10 a manner which will be described<br>
hereinafter. In this embodiment of the invention a pull tab 68, similar to that<br>
shown with respect to Figure 3, having two sections 70 and 72 is also depicted.<br>
Pull tab 68 may be conveniently attached to the case 90 in a manner similar to<br>
that shown in Figure 3. The locking protrusion 56 is shown depending from the<br>
bottom of the case of the auxiliary module 90. In this embodiment of the<br>
invention, locking protrusion 56 may be exactly the same as shown with respect<br>
to the module 50 shown in Figure 3. Protruding there through is an auxiliary<br>
switch rider 328 which may move up and down in a manner to be described with<br>
respect to the description associated with Figure 6. As is also described with<br>
respect to Figure 6 a cradle follower 332 which protrudes at a right angle relative<br>
to the cam follower 328 from the other side of the enclosure 326 interacts with a<br>
bell alarm device 324 as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Referring now to Figure 5 in conjunction with Figures 1, 4 and Figure 6<br>
which will be described in greater detail hereinafter, the interlocking operation of<br>
the module 90 with respect to the circuit breaker 10 is described and depicted. In<br>
particular the module 90 is shown with its two sides 94 and 326 as described<br>
previously with respect to Figure 4, but with the cam follower 328 and cradle<br>
follower 332 deleted for simplicity. The locking protrusion 56 is clearly shown.<br>
Locking protrusion 56 may be insertable into a complimentary locking opening<br>
100 in an intermediate base or floor 102 of the upper circuit breaker case or cover<br>
section 18. Once locked into place the module 90 may be disengaged or<br>
extracted from the opening 100 by utilization of the tab arrangement 68 shown in<br>
Figure 4, but deleted here for purposes of simplicity of illustration. The case<br>
module 90 is pulled upwardly as a result of tugging on its tab 68 so that that the<br>
flexible protrusion 56 flexes inwardly at the slots or opening 64 to disengage it<br>
from the locking opening 100. In the insertion process the tabs of the locking<br>
member 56 are depressed or flexed inwardly during the insertion process so that<br>
the enlarged region 60 is made circumferentially smaller so that the locking<br>
opening 100 may capture the locking protrusion 56 between its enlarged portion<br>
60 and its base portion 68 such as is shown in Figure 3 for example.<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, the disposition of an auxiliary switch 320 and a<br>
bell alarm 324 is shown. In particular there is the module 90 shown partially broken<br>
away inside of which the auxiliary switch 320 is shown. Alternatively, a pair of<br>
auxiliary switches 320 or a pair of bell alarms 324 may be disposed within the<br>
enclosure 326 or the disposition of the auxiliary switch 320 and bell alarm 324 may<br>
be reversed. The bell alarm 324 is disposed in the same housing 326 on the other<br>
side of an insulating auxiliary wall 325. Switch 320 has protruding from the bottom<br>
thereof the axially movable cam follower 328 which follows the upper cam surface<br>
100A of a cross bar assembly 100 of the circuit breaker. When the contacts of the<br>
circuit breaker are closed, the assembly 100 is in one disposition and when the<br>
contacts are open, the assembly is in a second disposition. The difference between<br>
the dispositions is tracked by the cam follower 328. The cam follower 328<br>
interconnects with contacts (not shown) in the auxiliary switch 320 such that<br>
normally open contact 320A is in one disposition when the contacts are open and in<br>
the opposite disposition when the contacts are closed. The complimentary set of<br>
contacts 320B are in the opposite dispositions at these times. Appropriate power for<br>
causing certain desirable functions as a result of the status and/or change of status of<br>
the auxiliary switch 320 may be provided by a set of wires. There is also provided<br>
the cradle follower 332 which protrudes at a right angle relative to the cam follower<br>
328 from the other side of the module 90 for interacting with or actuating the bell<br>
alarm 324. This arrangement may be used to alert operating personnel that the<br>
circuit breaker has tripped and the contacts are opened. Both the auxiliary switch<br>
320 and alarm 324 are contained within one enclosure 326 - 94 (see Fig 4) which is<br>
independently removable from the circuit breaker mechanism without complete<br>
disassembly thereof by removal of the aforementioned secondary or auxiliary cover<br>
22 (not shown) and subsequent removal of the module 90. Insertion of the module<br>
90 may occur in a similar but reverse manner.<br>
It is to be understood with respect to the embodiments of this invention that<br>
although the modules 50and 90, for example, may be utilized to show casings for<br>
shunt trip apparatus, auxiliary switches and bell alarms, such cases may be also be<br>
used for under voltage relays and the like. In fact there is no limitation to the<br>
apparatus which may be disposed within the case depending upon the desirability of<br>
the electrical function to be performed and the availability of space.<br>
The apparatus taught with respect to the embodiments of this invention has<br>
many advantages. One advantage lies in the fact that the locking arrangement<br>
shown herein provides a secure way to affix or maintain an auxiliary module or the<br>
like within a circuit breaker case so as to prevent ejection therefrom by the build up<br>
of hot gases which may permeate the circuit breaker case under pressure during a<br>
circuit interrupting operation. In one embodiment of the invention, were it not for<br>
the locking arrangement the gases, which are permitted to reach the accessories due<br>
to the conflicting need to seal the breaker yet still permit access to the operating<br>
mechanism to actuate the accessories, could propel the module outwardly against the<br>
secondary or auxiliary cover 22 shown in Figure 1, thus perhaps causing damage to<br>
the cover or destroying its structural integrity.<br>
