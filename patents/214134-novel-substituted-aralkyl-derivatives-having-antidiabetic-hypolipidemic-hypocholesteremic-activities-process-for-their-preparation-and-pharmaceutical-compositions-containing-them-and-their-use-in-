plasma levels and hence are useful in combating different medical conditions, where such lowering (and raising) is beneficial. Thus, it could be used in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of obesity, hyperlipidaemia, hypercholesteremia, hypertension, atherosclerotic disease events, vascular restenosis, diabetes and many other related conditions .<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) &amp; (Ilia) are useful to prevent or reduce the risk of developing atherosclerosis, which leads to diseases and conditions such as artereosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, stroke, coronary heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, peripheral vessel diseases and related disorders.<br>
These compounds of general formula (I) &amp; (Ilia) are useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of metabolic disorders loosely defined as Syndrome X. The characteristic features of Syndrome X include initial insulin resistance followed by hyperinsulineima, dyslipidemia and impaired glucose tolerance. The glucose intolerance can lead to non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, Type 2 diabetes), which is characterized by hyperglycemia, which if not controlled may lead to diabetic complications or metabolic disorders caused by insulin resistance. Diabetes is no longer considered to be associated only with glucose metabolism, but it affects anatomical and physiological parameters, the intensity of which vary depending upon stages/duration and severity of the diabetic state. The compounds of this invention are also useful in prevention, halting or slowing progression or reducing the risk of the above mentioned disorders along with the resulting secondary diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, like arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis; diabetic retinopathy, diabetic neuropathy and renal disease including diabetic nephropathy, glomerulonephritis, glomerular sclerosis, nephrotic syndrome, hypertensive nephrosclerosis and end stage renal diseases, like microalbuminuria and albuminuria, which may be result of hyperglycemia or hyperinsulinemia.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be useful as aldose reductase inhibitors; for improving cognitive functions in dementia, and in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of disorders such as psoriasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), cancer, osteoporosis, leptin resistance, inflammation and inflammatory bowel diseases, xanthoma, pancreatitis, myotonic dystrophy, endothelial cell dysfunction and hyperlipidemia.<br>

The compounds of the present invention are useful in the treatment of the diseases mentioned herein, alone or in combination with one or more hypoglycemic, antihyperglycemic, hypolipidaemic, hypolipoproteinemic agents. antioxidants, antihypertensives, such as HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, fibrate. statins, glitazones, sulfonyl ureas, insulin, a-glycosidase inhibitors, nicotinic acid, cholestyramine, cholestipol or probucol, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hyperlipidaemia has been recognized as the major risk factor in causing cardiovascular diseases due to atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis and other such peripheral vascular diseases affect the quality of life of a large population in the world. The therapy aims to lower the elevated plasma LDL cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and plasma triglycerides in order to prevent or reduce the risk of occurrence of cardiovascular diseases. The detailed etiology of atherosclerosis and coronary artery diseases is discussed by Ross and Glomset [New Engl. J. Med., 295, 369-377 (1976)]. Plasma cholesterol is generally found esterified with various serum lipoproteins and numerous studies have suggested an inverse relationship between serum HDL-cholesterol level and risk for occurrence of cardiovascular disease. Many studies have suggested an increased risk of coronary artery diseases (CAD) due to elevated LDL and VLDL-cholesterol levels [Stampfer et al., N. Engl. J. Med., 325, 373-381(1991)]. The other studies illustrate protective effects of HDL against progression of atherosclerosis. Thus. HDL has become a crucial factor in treating diseases with increased levels of cholesterol [Miller et. al., Br. Med. J. 282, 1741-1744(1981); Picardo et al.. Arteriosclerosis, 6, 434-441 (1986); Macikinnon eta/.. J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2548-2552 (1986)].<br>
Diabetes is associated with a number of complications and also affect a large population. This disease is usually associated with other diseases such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and angina, ft is well established that improper treatment can aggravate impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, thereby leading to frank diabetes. Further, patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes often have raised triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol concentrations and therefore, have greater risk of cardiovascular diseases. The present therapy for these diseases includes sulfonylureas and<br>

biguanides along with insulin. This type of drug therapy may lead to mild to severe hypoglycemia, which may lead to coma or in some cases may lead to death, as a result of unsatisfactory glycaemic control by these drugs Recent addition of drugs in the treatment of diabetes are the thiazolidinediones, drugs having insulin-sensitizing action. Thiazolidmediones like troglitazone, rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are prescribed alone or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents.<br>
These are useful iii treating diabetes, lipid metabolism but are suspected to have ■tumor-inducing potential and cause hepatic dysfunction, which may lead to liver failure. Further, serious undesirable side-effects have occurred in animal and/or human studies which include cardiac hypertrophy, hema dilution and liver toxicity in a few glitazones progressing to advanced human trials. The drawback is considered to be idiosyncratic. Presently, there is a need for a safe and an effective drug, to treat insulin resistance, diabetes and hyperlipidemia.f Exp. Clin. Endocrinol. Diabetes: 109(4), S548-9 (2001)]<br>
Obesity is another major health problem being associated with increased morbidity and mortality. It is a metabolic disorder, in which excess of fat is accumulated in the body. Although, its etiology is unclear, the general feature includes excess of calorie intake than it is consumed. Various therapies such as dieting, exercise, appetite suppression, inhibition of fat absorption etc. have been used to combat obesity. However, more efficient therapies to treat this abnormality is essential as obesity is closely related to several diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, gout, osteoarthritis, hyperhpidaemia and reduced fertility. It also leads to social and psychological problems [Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery: 1(4), 276-86 (2002)].<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR) is a member of the steroid/ retinoid/ thyroid hormone receptor family. PPARcc, PPARy and PPAR5 have been identified as subtypes of PPARs. Extensive reviews regarding PPAR, their role in different diseased conditions are widely published [Endocrine Reviews, 20(5), 649-688 (1999); J. Medicinal Chemistry, 43(4), 58-550 (2000); Cell, 55, 932-943 (1999); Nature, 405, 421-424 (2000); Trends in Pharmacological ScL, 469-473 (2000)]. PPARy activation has been found to play a central role in initiating and regulating adipocyte differentiation [Endocrinology 135, 798-800, (1994)] and energy homeostasis, [Cell, 83,<br>
5<br><br>
ZRC-MC-009<br>
803-812 (1995); Cell, 99, 239-242 (1999)]. PPARy agonists would stimulate the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors and cause morphological and molecular changes characteristic o\' a more differentiated, less malignant state. During adipocyte differentiation, several highly specialized proteins are induced, which are being involved in lipid storage and metabolism. It is accepted that PPARy activation leads to expression of CAP gene [Cell Biology, 95, 14751-14756, (1998)], however, the exact link from PPARy activation to changes in glucose metabolism and decrease in insulin resistance in muscle has not been clear. PPARa is involved in stimulating P-oxidation of fatty acids [Trends Endocrine. Metabolism, 4, 291-296 (1993)] resulting in plasma circulating free fatty acid reduction [Current. Biol., 5, 618-621 (1995)]. Recently, role "of PPARy activation in the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors has been implicated in the treatment of cancer. [Cell, 79, 1147-1156 (1994); Cell, 377-389 (1996); Molecular Cell, 465-470 (1998); Carcinogenesis, 1949-1953 (1998); Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 94, 237-241 (1997); Cancer Research, 58, 3344-3352 (1998)]. Since PPARy is expressed in certain cells consistently, PPARy agonists would lead to nontoxic chemotherapy. There is growing evidence that PPAR agonists may also influence the cardiovascular system through PPAR receptors as well as directly by modulating vessel wall function [Med. Res. Rev.. 20 (5), 350-366 (2000)].<br>
PPAR a agonists have been found useful in the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). Dual PPAR a and y agonists have been suggested to be useful for Syndrome X (WO 97 25042). PPAR y agonists and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have exhibited synergism and indicated the usefulness of the combination in the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma (EP 0753 298).<br>
Leptin is a protein when bound to leptin receptors is involved in sending satiety signal to the hypothalamus. Leptin resistance would therefore lead to excess food in-take, reduced energy expenditure, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes [Science, 269, 543-46(1995)]. It has been reported that insulin sensitizers lower plasma leptin concentration [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 93, 5793-5796 (1996): WO 98/02159)].<br>

A mixture of Ethyl (2S)-ethoxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propanoate (1.9 g), and potassium carbonate (1.51 g) in toluene (15 mL) was heated at 80 °C for lhr. The mixture was cooled to 50 °C and Methyl 2-[5-methyl-2-thiophen-2-yl-oxazol-4yl]-ethylsulfonate (2.56 g) was added. The reaction mixture was continued heating at 80 °C for 16 hrs. Later it was cooled to 20 °C - 25 °C, water (20 mL) was added and the crude product was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 25 mL). The organic extract was washed with water (2 x 20 mL), brine (25 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure to obtain an oily product. The crude oily product was chromatographed over silica gel using ethyl acetate: petroleum ether (60-80) (1:9) as an eluent to afford the title product as a yellow oil.<br>

Lithium aluminium hydride (465 mg) was added to an ice cold solution of Ethyl(2S)-ethoxy-3- |4-[2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol-4-yl)-ethoxy]-phenyl}-propanoate (2.7 g) in tetrahydrofuran (30 mL) in portions over a period of 15 minutes and the reaction mixture was stirred for further 15 minutes at the same temperature. The reaction was quenched by carefully adding saturated solution of sodium sulfate in water dropwise. Solids were filtered off and washed with hot ethyl acetate. Combined filtrate was dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated. Crude product was chromatographed over silicagel using 5 to 25 % ethyl acetate in petroleum ether to yield 2.6 g of title compound. In like manner following compounds in the table 3&amp;4 were prepared following the procedure described in preparation 4.<br>

ZRC-MC-009<br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) were bred in Zydus animal house. All these animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25±1 °C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water ad libitum. SAM of 20-30 g body weight range were used.<br>
The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.001 to 50 nig / kg/ day dose for 6 days. The compound was administered after suspending it in 0.25 % CMC or dissolving it in water, when compound is water-soluble. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% of Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected on 0th day and in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 6th day of the treatment. The blood was collected in non "heparinised capillary and the serum was analyzed for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergermeyer, H., O., Ed., 1963. 211-214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6: 24-27). Measurement of serum triglyceride and total cholesterol was done using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India). Formula for calculation :<br>

ii)        Cholesterol, lowering activity in hypercholesterolemic rat models<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats stock bred in Zydus animal house were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25±1 °C. Rats of 100-150 g body weight range were used for the experiment. Animals were made hypercholesterolemic by feeding 1 % cholesterol and 0.5 % sodium cholate mixed with standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water ad libitum for 5 days. The animals were maintained on the same diet throughout the experiment [Petit D.. Bonnefis M. T., Rey C and Infante R., Effects of ciprofibrate on liver lipids and lipoprotein synthesis in normal and hyperlipidemic rats, Atherosclerosis, 74, 215-225(1988)].<br>
The test compounds were administered orally at a dose 0.03 to 50 mg/ kg/ day for 4 days, after suspending it in 0.25 % CMC or dissolving it in water when compound is water-soluble. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25% of Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state on 0th and I hour after drug administration on 6th  day of the treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through non-heparinised capillary and the serum samples were analyzed for triglyceride and total cholesterol using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India). LDL and HDL by commercial kits (Point Scientific, USA). LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride.<br>
The reduction in VLDL cholesterol is calculated according to the formula. VLDL cholesterol in mg/dl = Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol - LDL cholesterol<br>

iii)       Serum glucose lowering activity in db/db mice models<br>
Homozygous animal CsyBL/KsJ-db/db mice are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., 85, 962-967, 1990), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic. The homozygous animals very closely mimic the human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are not sufficiently controlled. Since this type of model resembles human type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the invention were tested for their antidiabetic activity in this model.<br>
The compounds of the present invention showed serum glucose and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
Male Cs? BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 40 to 60 grams, procured from the Jackson Laboratory, USA, were used in the experiment.<br>
Test compounds were suspended on 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose or dissolved in water when the compound is water soluble and administered to test group containing 6 animals at a dose of 0.001 mg to 50 mg/kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml/kg). On the 6th day, one hour after the drug dosing, blood was collected from retro-orbital sinus and the serum was analyzed for glucose and triglycerides were measured using commercial kits (Zydus-Cadila, Pathline, Ahmedabad, India). The serum glucose and triglyceride lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according of the formula: Serum glucose lowering activity (%) =<br><br><br><br>
