The compounds of the formula (1) according to the present invention are particularly suitable as UV filters, i.e. for protecting ultraviolet-sensitive organic materials, in particular the skin and hair of humans and animals, from the harmful effects of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as sunscreens in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medical preparations. These compounds can be used both in dissolved form and in the micronized state.<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved state (soluble organic filters, solubelized organic filters) or in the micronised state (nano-scalar organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles can be used for the preÂ¬paration of the micronised UV absorbers, for example wet-mifling,wet-kneading, spray-drying from a suitable solvent, by the expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) by re precipitation from suitable solvents.<br>
The micronised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2, preferably from 0.03 to 1.5, and more especially from 0,05 to 1.0 micrometer.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a UV absorber dispersion, comprising<br>
(a)	a micronised UV absorber of formula (1), each of them having a particle size from 0,02 to<br>
2 urn, and<br>
(b)	a suitable dispersing agent.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invenÂ¬tion may additionally contain one or more than one further conventional UV filter.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, alÂ¬coholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations,<br><br>
powders or ointments. In addition to the above-mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaÂ¬ceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or mi-croemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especÂ¬ially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuÂ¬vants.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) may also be used as as an anti-wrinkle perception modifier (see Example 29). This is a futher object of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the following combinations comprising UV absorbers are of special interest:<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick prepaÂ¬rations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or microemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preÂ¬ferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water,<br><br>
and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuvants.<br>

The compounds of the formula (1) according to the present invention are particularly suitable as UV filters, i.e. for protecting ultraviolet-sensitive organic materials, in particular the skin and hair of humans and animals, from the harmful effects of UV radiation. These compounds are therefore suitable as sunscreens in cosmetic, pharmaceutical and veterinary medical preparations. These compounds can be used both in dissolved form and in the micronized state.<br>
The UV absorbers according to the present invention can be used either in the dissolved state (soluble organic filters, solubelized organic filters) or in the micronised state (nano-scalar organic filters, particulate organic filters, UV-absorber pigments).<br>
Any known process suitable for the preparation of microparticles can be used for the pre-paration of the micronised UV absorbers, for example wet-milling,wet-kneading, spray-drying from a suitable solvent, by the expansion according to the RESS process (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions) by re precipitation from suitable solvents.<br>
The micronised UV absorbers so obtained usually have an average particle size from 0.02 to 2, preferably from 0.03 to 1.5, and more especially from 0,05 to 1.0 micrometer.<br>
A further object of the present invention is a UV absorber dispersion, comprising<br>
(a)	a micronised UV absorber of formula (1), each of them having a particle size from 0,02 to<br>
2 urn, and<br>
(b)	a suitable dispersing agent.<br>
The cosmetic formulations or pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may additionally contain one or more than one further conventional UV filter.<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, al-coholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations,<br><br>
powders or ointments. In addition to the above-mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or mi-croemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water, and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmetically acceptable adjuvants.<br>
The compounds of formula (1) may also be used as as an anti-wrinkle perception modifier (see Example 29). This is a futher object of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the following combinations comprising UV absorbers are of special interest:<br>
The cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may be, for example, creams, gels, lotions, alcoholic and aqueous/alcoholic solutions, emulsions, wax/fat compositions, stick preparations, powders or ointments. In addition to the above mentioned UV filters, the cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations may contain further adjuvants as described below.<br>
As water- and oil-containing emulsions (e.g. W/O, O/W, O/W/O and W/O/W emulsions or microemulsions) the preparations contain, for example, from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15 % by weight and especially from 0.5 to 10 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of one or more UV absorbers, from 1 to 60 % by weight, especially from 5 to 50 % by weight and preferably from 10 to 35 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one oil component, from 0 to 30 % by weight, especially from 1 to 30 % by weight und preferably from 4 to 20 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of at least one emulsifier, from 10 to 90 % by weight, especially from 30 to 90 % by weight, based on the total weight of the composition, of water,<br><br>
and from 0 to 88.9 % by weight, especially from 1 to 50 % by weight, of further cosmeticaily acceptable adjuvants.<br>
