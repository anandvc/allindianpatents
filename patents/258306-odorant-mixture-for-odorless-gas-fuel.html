				<td>ODORANT MIXTURE FOR AN ODOURLESS GASEOUS FUEL<br>
5 [0001] The present invention relates to the field of odorants for gaseous fuels,<br>
in particular odourless gaseous fuels, and has nnore especially as subject<br>
matter a composition comprising at least one alkyl sulphide and at least two<br>
alkyl acrylates which makes possible the detection of gas leaks and the<br>
prevention of the risks of explosion which result therefrom.<br>
10 [0002] Town gases and coke oven gases, which were obtained by thermal<br>
processes, were used for a long time in the past as gaseous fuels, both for<br>
public lighting and for domestic requirements. These gases comprised highly<br>
odoriferous components. Consequently, they had a strong specific odour, so<br>
that a gas leak could be easily detected.<br>
15 [0003] In contrast, the gaseous fuels currently used, whether natural gas,<br>
propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas (or LPG) or even oxygen (for example<br>
for welding operations), are essentially odourless, either because of their origin<br>
or because of the purification treatment which they have received.<br>
[0004] Thus, if leaks are not noticed in time, the rapid formation occurs of<br>
20 mixtures of gaseous fuels and of air which can explode, with consequently a<br>
high risk potential.<br>
[0005] For these safety reasons, the natural gas moving in gas pipelines is<br>
odorized by injection (in specialized stations) of appropriate additives known as<br>
odorants.<br>
25 [0006] Natural gas is generally conveyed odourless, after an appropriate<br>
purification treatment, from the production sites to the consuming countries,<br>
either via gas pipelines or (in liquid state) in specialized ships (methane<br>
carriers). In France, for example, natural gas is thus received in a limited<br>
number of injection stations where the odorant is injected, so that the natural<br>
30 gas, both that which moves through the French gas pipeline network and that<br>
which is stored in underground tanks, is odorized, which makes possible easy<br>
detection in the event of a leak, wherever in the network it occurs.<br>
- 3 -<br>
[0007] In other countries, natural gas may be distributed over the area of the<br>
^ country by a network of pipelines in which it moves without odorant, the natural<br>
gas then being odorized as it enters the towns in which it is consumed, which<br>
requires an even higher number of injection stations.<br>
5 [0008] Storage tanks are generally maintained under an atmosphere of<br>
nitrogen or of natural gas in order to limit, at this stage, the risks of explosion.<br>
[0009] Alkyl sulphides, used as odorants, alone or as a mixture, are known.<br>
Mention may be made, for example, of diethyl sulphide, dimethyl sulphide,<br>
methyl ethyl sulphide or tetrahydrothiophene, which are widely used for their<br>
10 excellent properties, in particular which are capable of triggering a feeling of<br>
alarm in people in the event of an accidental leak of natural gas thus odorized<br>
and of initiating the necessary protective operations.<br>
[0010] However, during the combustion of natural gas, these products<br>
generate an amount of sulphur dioxide which, however low it might be,<br>
15 becomes not insignificant when an overall balance is carried out on the scale of<br>
a country or of a region, in particular with a high level of industrialization or<br>
urbanization. Thus, by way of example, the combustion of a natural gas<br>
odorized with tetrahydrothiophene at a concentration of 10 mg/Sm^ (or number<br>
of m^ of the gas, measured under standard temperature and pressure<br>
20 conditions) generates 7.3 mg/Sm^ of sulphur dioxide.<br>
[0011] In the general context of better consideration of environmental<br>
constraints, it is therefore desirable to reduce the amounts of SO2 discharged to<br>
the ecosphere via odorants based on alkyl sulphides present in natural gas<br>
during the combustion of the latter.<br>
25 [0012] Furthermore, the use of alkyl acrylates as components of gas odorant<br>
mixtures is disclosed in the literature.<br>
[0013] As an example, Patent Application DE 19837066 mentions a process<br>
for the odorization of natural gas by addition of a mixture comprising an alkyl<br>
acrylate, a nitrogenous compound of pyrazine type and an antioxidant.<br>
30 However, this mixture exhibits the disadvantage of not having an odour<br>
characteristic of gas and is thus capable of being misinterpreted in the event of<br>
a gas leak. The risk is, of course, the non-detection of this leak and an<br>
explosion, if the concentration of gas in the air reaches its lower explosive limit.<br>
[0014] Patent JP 55-137190 also discloses an odorant mixture combining ethyl<br>
acrylate with a specific sulphur compound, in this instance tert-butyl mercaptan<br>
5 (or TBM). However, the major disadvantage of this mixture is that, because of<br>
the chemical reactivity of TBM with ethyl acrylate, the 2 components of the<br>
odorant mixture have to be stored in the various injection stations in separate<br>
tanks and also require separate injection pumps and heads for introduction into the gas pipeline. This results, in view of the complex logistics for the odorization ^ ^<br>
10 of natural gas set out above, in a considerable increase in the costs of the<br>
injection stations resulting from the necessary multiplication in the storage tanks<br>
and injection pumps and heads.<br>
[0015] Furthermore, Patent Application WO 2004/024852 discloses an odorant<br>
consisting of four components, including an aikyi acrylate, an alkyl sulphide and<br>
15 an antioxidizing stabilizing agent, such as fert-butylhydroxytoluene,<br>
hydroquinone, and the like.<br>
[0016] It is an aim of the present invention to provide a novel odorant mixture<br>
which overcomes in particular the disadvantages of the odorant mixtures of the<br>
prior art set out above.<br>
20 [0017] A subject-matter of the present invention is thus a composition which<br>
can be used in particular as odorant for a gaseous fuel, more particularly<br>
natural gas, comprising:<br>
from 0.1 to 49.9 parts by weight of at least one alkyl sulphide (I) of<br>
formula:<br>
25 R^-S-R2<br>
in which R^ and R^, which are identical or different, represent:<br>
an alkyl radical comprising from 1 to 4 carbon atoms; or<br>
R^ and R^, taken with the sulphur atom to which they are<br>
attached, represent a saturated or unsaturated ring comprising from 3 to 5<br>
30 carbon atoms which is optionally substituted by a C1-C4 alkyl or C1-C4 alkenyl<br>
radical;<br>
— 6 —<br>
" " • ~ ^^^ "^' " " ""<br>
from 50 to 99.8 parts by weight of at least two alkyl acrylates (II), the<br>
" alkyl radicals of which comprise from 1 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 1 to<br>
8;<br>
from 0.001 to 0.1 part by weight of at least one compound {III) which<br>
5 inhibits the polymerization of the alkyl acrylates (II) and which is active in the<br>
presence or in the absence of oxygen, preferably comprising a stable nitroxide<br>
radical of formula (IV):<br>
R4<br>
\ .<br>
N O<br>
R3<br>
in which:<br>
10 - R^ and R^, which are identical or different, each represent a<br>
tertiary or secondary hydrocarbon radical comprising from 2 to 30 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably from 4 to 15, and optionally one or more heteroatoms chosen<br>
from sulphur, phosphorus, nitrogen or oxygen; or<br>
R^ and R^, taken with the nitrogen atom to which they are<br>
15 attached, represent a cyclic hydrocarbon radical comprising from 4 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, preferably from 4 to 6, the said radical optionally being substituted.<br>
[0018] The composition according to the invention confers on gaseous fuels, in<br>
particular on natural gas, after its injection into the latter, a high odorant power<br>
comparable to that obtained with the odorants based on alkyl sulphide of the<br>
20 prior art, allowing any person present in the vicinity of a leak to recognize the<br>
latter and to take the appropriate safety measures. This high odorant power is<br>
obtained at the same time as a significant reduction in the amounts of SO2<br>
discharged to the ecosphere after combustion lof the gas thus odorized.^ Finally, this composition, because'of the absence of reactivity between the compounds<br>
25 (I) and (II), can be employed in injection stations using a single storage tank, a<br>
single injection pump and a single injection head, which results in considerably )<br>
simplified logistics. \.<br>
[0019] According to a preferred alternative fomri of the composition according<br>
^ to the invention, the composition comprises from 5 to 14.95 parts by weight of<br>
compound(s) (I), from 85 to 94.95 parts by weight of compounds (II) and from<br>
0.005 to 0.05 part by weight of compound(s) (III).<br>
5 [0020] Preference is given to the use, as alkyl sulphide(s) (I), of<br>
tetrahydrothiophene (THT), methyUethyl sulphide (MES), dimethyl sulphide<br>
(DMS) and/or diethyl sulphide (DES).<br>
[0021] The acrylic acid esters (II) are chosen in particular from methyl, ethyl, npropyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl and<br>
10 dodecyl acrylaies.<br>
[0022] According to a preferred embodiment of the composition according to<br>
the invention, use is made of a combination of alkyl acrylates comprising in<br>
particular ethyl acrylate and advantageously of a combination of alkyl acrylates<br>
comprising in particular methyl acrylate and ethyl acrylate. The preferred<br>
15 combinations of alkyl acrylates comprising ifi particular methyl acrylate and<br>
ethyl acrylate generally comprise 20 to 40 parts by weight of methyl acrylate per<br>
100 parts by weight of the methyl acrylate + ethyl acrylate total.<br>
[0023] According to a very particularly preferred alternative form of the<br>
invention, use is made of a composition comprising tetrahydrothiophene, methyl<br>
20 acrylate and ethyl acrylate.<br>
[0024] The presence in the composition according to the invention of<br>
compound(s) (III) has the effect of inhibiting the polymerization of the acrylates,<br>
which are very reactive monomers which can spontaneously polymerize. Such<br>
an uncontrolled polymerization is capable of placing in danger people found<br>
25 close to injection stations, such as residents or workers in charge of<br>
maintenance, due to the risk of explosion. If this polymerization occurs during<br>
storage, including, for example, in storage tanks or vessels of injection stations,<br>
it can also result in rapid fouling, indeed even blocking, of the pipes between<br>
the storage tank and the injection point. Such a phenomenon can result in an<br>
30 uncontrolled fall in the concentration of the odorant in the natural gas, which<br>
increases the risk related to an undetected gas leak.<br>

"~— - ^ ^ - ^ - -<br>
[0025] The compounds of formula (IV) are known per se and their preparation<br>
W is, for example, described in the work "Synthetic Chemistry of Stable Nitroxides"<br>
by L. B. Volodarsky et aL, CRC Press. (1993), ISBN: 0-8493-4590-1.<br>
[0026] Inhibitors of formula (IV) exhibit the advantage, in contrast to other<br>
5 inhibitors, such as radical inhibitors belonging to the family of the<br>
hydroquinones, of not requiring storage of the odorant mixture under air. This is<br>
because storage under air is rendered necessary for radical inhibitors of<br>
hydroquinone type owing to the fact that the active form of the inhibitor is a<br>
molecule comprising a radical which is formed following reaction with oxygen.<br>
10 [0027] In point of fact, it is highly advantageous, in designing injection stations,<br>
to be able to store the odorant mixture in the appropriate vessel under natural<br>
gas pressure. Such an embodiment makes it possible advantageously to<br>
increase the efficiency of the injection pumps.<br>
[0028] The inhibitors of formula (IV) also offer the advantage, for the same<br>
15 reason, of being able to be used in tanks for storage under nitrogen,<br>
encountered in some stations for the injection of natural gas.<br>
[0029] According to a particularly preferred alternative form, use is made, as<br>
inhibitor of formula (IV), of a compound derived from tetramethylpiperidine oxide<br>
(also denoted by the term TEMPO) of formula (IVa):<br>
CH3<br>
/ ^ ^ " ' .<br>
R5 ( N—O<br>
CH3<br>
20<br>
in which R^ represents a hydroxyl, amino, R^COO- or R^CON- group<br>
where R^ is a C1-C4 alkyl radical.<br>
[0030] It is preferable advantageously to choose the compound of formula (III)<br>
from at least one of the following compounds:<br>
25 - compound (A), known as N-(tert-butyl)-N-(1-[ethoxy(ethyl)-<br>
phosphino]propyl)nitroxide, of formula:<br>

\ = = : / \ CH3<br>
H3C<br>
[0031] Another subject-matter of the invention is a process for the odorization<br>
of an odourless gaseous fuel comprising the addition of an effective amount of v<br>
10 the composition comprising at least one alkyl sulphide, at least two alkyl acrylates and at least one compound (III) which inhibits the polymerization of 1<br>
alkyl acrylates and which is stable in the presence and in the absence of oxygen, preferably of formula (IV). The amount of the said composition can be<br>
determined by a person skilled in the art by means of systematic tests, taking<br>
15 into account the specific characteristics of the gaseous fuel and of the<br>
distribution networks. Purely by way of indication, this effective amount can be<br>
" between 1 and 500 mg/Sm^, preferably between 2 mg/Sm^ and 50 mg/Sm^.<br>
[0032] Tlie composition according to tlie invention described above can be<br>
used as is or else can be diluted in a solvent or a mixture of solvents which is<br>
5 inert with regard to acrylates. Mention may be made, as examples of solvents,<br>
of cyclohexane or n-hexane.<br>
[0033] The dilution of the composition can reach 85%, i.e. 15 parts by weight<br>
of the composition according to the invention are diluted in 85 parts by weight of<br>
solvent.<br>
10 [0034] The gaseous fuels to which the process according to the invention<br>
applies comprise: natural gas, propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas (or<br>
LPG) or even oxygen or also hydrogen, such as that generated by fuel ceils.<br>
[0035] Natural gas is a preferred gaseous fuel according to the present<br>
invention due to its very widespread use and to the scale of the distribution<br>
15 networks, making it particularly desirable to reduce any danger resulting from<br>
the risk of leakage.<br>
[0036] As regards natural gas, the composition which can be used as odorant<br>
is added by injection in specialized stations according to conventional<br>
techniques employedis this field.<br>
20 [0037] Finally, a subject-matter of the invention is a gaseous fuel, preferably a<br>
natural gas, comprising an amount of between 1 mg/Sm^ and 500 mg/Sm^,<br>
preferably between 2 mg/Sm^ and 50 mg/Sm^, of the composition comprising at<br>
least one alkyl sulphide, at least two alkyl acrylates and at least one compound<br>
(III), preferably of fomnula (IV).<br>
25 [0038] The following examples are given purely by way of illustration of the<br>
invention and should not under any circumstances be interpreted as limiting the<br>
scope thereof.<br>
