				<td>AEROGEL CONTAINING BLANKET<br>
INVENTION [0001]      The present invention relates to a blanket that contains aerogel particles and fibers, a process of making the same, and uses thereof<br>
[0002] Aerogels have a very low density high porosity, and small pore diameters. Aerogels, in particular those with porosities of greater than about 60% and densities of less than about 0.4 g/cc, exhibit very low thermal conductivity. Therefore, aerogels are used as thermal insulating materials as is described, for example, in EP-A-0 171 722, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein.<br>
[0003] However, aerogels can have several disadvantages. For instance, aerogels can have poor mechanical stability, can be dusty, and, when in particulate form, can be prone to settling over time. In addition, aerogels can be brittle, non-flexible, and fracture when compressed. Generally, any attempt to compress or flex large pieces'made of aerogel will result in breaking them. Also, transportation, handling, and installation can be difficult with aerogels due to their lack of shod: resistance and flexibility.<br>
[0004] Accordingly, there is a need for composites that avoid one or more of the above-described disadvantages.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0005]      A feature of the present invention is to provide a process of making a blanket or mat that contains aerogel particles and fibers, wherein the blanket preferably has low thermal conductivity, is mechanically stable, and/or is easy to manufacture.

[0014]      All patents, applications and publications mentioned throughout the application<br><br>
ait incorporated in their entirety by reference herein and form a part of the present application<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESBM INVENTION [0015] The present invention relates to a blanket and to the process of making the blanket More particularly, the present invention relates to an aerogel containing blanket or mat which overcomes many of the above-described disadvantages and can be utilized in a number of applications involving insulation and the like, including as a material to be located between glass or plastic layers to form an overall panel which is preferably translucent and can be used in a number of applications, such as walls, curtains, floors, windows, and the like, The blanket can be mechanically stable, dust-free, and easy to manufacture, and/or can have a low<br><br>
thermal conductivity for use as an insulative material.<br>
[0016] The present invention also relates to a blanket containing aerogel, such as in the form of aerogel particles and fibers. Topically, the blanket is a fibrous matrix which is preferably a non-woven fibrous matrix or febric which contains or has dispersed therein or amongst the fibers aerogel particles. Typically, the aerogel particles are pre-fonned and uniformly dispersed amongst the fibers. Thus, the present invention, in. at least one embodiment, relates to a blanket containing at least one wetlaid non-woven layer, wherein the wetlaid non-woven layer contains a uniform mixture of fibers and aerogel, and optionally, a binder.<br>
[0017] In the preferred process of making the blanket of the present invention, an aqueous shiny of hydrophobic aerogel particles, fibers, and at least one wetting agent is prepared. Preferably, the hydrophobic aerogel particles, at least temporarily, form an intimate mixture<br>
with the fibers. Tbe mixture can then be substantially dewafered, compressed dried and can be in the form of a web, and, if desired to form a more dense structure, can then be<br><br>
calendared to form a blanket of the present invention. In the present invention, the terns "aerogel particles" and "aerogels" are used interchangeably.<br>
[0018] Any aerogel particles can be used m the present invention. The preferred aerogel particles for use in the present invention are those that are based on metal oxides that are suitable for a sol-gel technique (C. I Brinker, G. W, Schercr, Sol-Gel Science. 1990, Chaps. 2 and 3), such as Si or Al compounds, or those based on organic substances that are suitable for the sol-gei technique, such as melamine-fcmaldebyde condensates (U.S. Pat No. 5,086,085) or resorcinol-&amp;nnalddiyde condensates (U.S. Pat, No, 4,873,21S), They can also be based on mixtures of the above-mentioned materials. Preferably, aerogels containing silicon (Si) compounds and, more preferably, SiOj are used. To reduce the radiative contribution to thermal conductivity, the aerogel can contain IR opacifiers, sue as carbon black, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, or zirconium dioxide, or mixtures thereof [0019] The aerogels can have any particle size that allows them to be dispersed within the slurry. The aerogels can have various particle size distributions. The aerogels can be in the form of comminuted powders or larger chunks. The larger pieces can have a diameter of from about 1 mm to sizes approaching the blanket fludmess, and the comminuted aerogels can have an average particle size diameter of 1 mm or less. The large pieces can be in the shape of spheres, although the aerogel chunks can have any shape. Preferably, the particle diameter of the aerogel particles is less than about 05 mm and, more preferably, less than about 0.2 mm. A suitable range is 0.01 mm to 1 mm, or 0.05 mm to 0.9 mm.<br>
[0020] Essentially, any commercially available hydrophobic aerogel can be used in the present invention. Examples include, but are not limited to, aerogels commercially available from Cabot Corporation. Particular commercially available types include, but are<br>
not limited to, NanogefcS) aerogels. AJ\ advantage of the present invention, and in particular<br>
the preferred process used with the present invention, is that the aerogel is pre-formed and<br><br>
therefore any desirable structure, morphology, or other characteristic can be chosen, and this characteristic is essentially present in the final product (e.g., blanket). [002X1 the aerogel particles used in the present invention have hydrophobic surface groups. In order to avoid any subsequent collapse of the aerogels by the condensation of moisture within the pores, it is preferred that hydrophobic groups be covaleotiy bonded on at least the inside surface of the aerogel Preferred groups for permanent hydrophobization are mono-, di-, or tri~substitated silyl groups of the formulas:<br><br>
where R1 is hydrogen or a non-reactive linear, branched, cyclic, aromatic, or heteroaromatic organic radical, preferably, a linear, branched, or cyclic Ci - Cn -alkyl radical or a C - Cu ~ aryl radical R2 and R3, yMck can be the same or different^ can be hydrogen or a non-reactive linear, branched, cyclic, aromatic, or heteroaromatic organic radical, preferably, a linear, branched, or cyclic C1 - C18 -alkyl radical, a C6 - C14 -aryl radical, an OH or OR'  group, wherein R is a linear or branched C1-C6 -alkyl radical; preferably trialkyi and/or triarylsDyl groups.<br>
[0022]      More preferably, R1 R2, and R3, which can be the same or different; are C1-C6 -alkyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl. [0023]      The use of trimethyl- and dimetfcylsttyl groups for pemianent.hydrophobizatian<br>
of the aerogel can. be particularly advantageous. These groups can be introduced as described in WO 94/25149 (incorporated in its entirety by reference herein) or by gas-phase reaction between the aerogel and, for example, an activated trialkylsilane derivative, such as<br><br>
a ohloratrialkylsilane or a hexaalkyldisilazane (of. R, Her, The Chemistry of Silica, Wiley &amp; Sons, 1979).<br>
[0024] Furthermore and within certain limits, the thermal conductivity of the aerogels can decrease as porosity increases and density decreases. For this reason, aerogels with porosities of greater than about 60% and densities of less than about 0.4 g/cc are preferred-More preferably, the aerogels of the present invention have densities of from about 0.05 to about 015 g/cc. The thermal conductivity of the awogel particles can be less than about 40 mW/m°K- preferably, less than about 25 mW/m°K, and, more preferably, the thermal conductivity of the aerogel particles is from about 12 to about 18 mW/m% or lower. (0025] As stated above, the aerogel particles of the present Invention are hydrophobic and/or have hydrophobic surface groups. However, hydrophobic aerogel particles cannot be wetted by water. In general, when hydrophobic aerogel particles are added to water they simply float on the surface, even under vigorous agitation- In order to achieve a homogeneous distribution of the hydrophobic aerogel particles and fibers in an aqueous slurry, at least one wetting agent, such as at least one surface active agent (e.g., surfactant), and/or at least one dispersant can be used to more easily permit the wetting of the hydrophobic aerogel particles with water. The dispersant may be selected from ionic (anionic and cationic) surfactants, amphoteric surfactants, nonionic surfactants, high molecular surfactants, and high molecular compounds, for example The anionic surfactants include alkyi sulfates and higher alkyi ether sulfites, more specifically, ammonium lauiyl sulfate, and sodium polyoxye&amp;yiene lauryi ether sulfate, for example. TTie cationic surfactants include aliphatic ammonium salts and amine salts, more specifically, alkyi trimefliylammonhim, and polyoxyethytene alkyi amine, for example.<br>
Tlie amphoteric surfactaats may be of betaux type, such as alkyi dimethyl beiain, or of oxido<br>
type, such as alkyi dimethyl amine oxide, for example.<br><br>
[0026] The nonionic surfactants include glycerol fetty acid ester, propylene glycol fitly acid ester, sorbitan fetty acid ester, polyoxyeihylene sozbitan fetty acid ester/tetraoleic acid polyoxyethylcne sorbitol, polyoxysthylene alkyl ether, polyoxyetbylene alkyi phenyl ether, polyoxyetbylene polyoxypropylene glycol, polyoxyefoylene polyoxypropylene alkyl ether, polyethylene glycol fatty acid ester, higher fatty acid alcohol ester, poiyhydric alcohol fetty acid ester, and others. A homogeneous distribution of the hydrophobic aerogel particles and fibers can provide the composite material wto<br>
[00271 Topical wetting agents thai can be used include, for example, AEROSOL OT (sodium di-2-ylhcxyisulfosuccirute), BARLOX 12i (a branched alkyldmefeylamine oxide), TRITON 100 (octylphenoxypolyedioxy(9-10)dhanol), TWEEN surfectants like TWEEN 100 surfactant, and BASF plttronic surfectants, A general class is glycols, alkoxylates polyoxyalkylene fatty etfcers, such as polyoxyefhylenc fetty ethers, soibitan esters, mono and diglycerides, polyoxyethyiens sorbitol esters, polymeric surfectants like Hypennen polymer surfectants, sodium coco-PG-dimonium chloride phosphate and coamidopropyl PO-dimonium chloride phosphate, phosphate esters, polyoxyethytene (POE) fatty acid esters, Renex nonionic surfectants (nonionic esters formed by reaction of ethylene oxide and unsaturated fetty acids and heterocyclic resin acids.), alcohol ethoxylaies, alcohol alkoxylates, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymers, polyoxyefoylene derivatives of sorbitan esters or combinations thereof The preferred wetting agent is capable of volatilizing during the drying and/or hot calendaring to allow suitable recovery of the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic aerogel particles. If the wetting agent remains on the surface of the aerogel particles, the remaining wetting agent can contribute to the overall thermal conductivity of the composite material Thus, the preferred wetting agent is one<br>
that is removeable, such as by volatilization with or witiiout decomposition or other means.<br>
Generally, any wetting agent thai is compatible whh the aerogel can be used.<br><br>
[0028] In general, hydrophobic aerogel particles can include a large surface area, such as, for example, about 700 m2/g. Accordingly, the amount of surfactant or dispersant that would allow complete wetting of the aerogel may be large. Generally, complete wetting is considered to take place when a sufficient amount of wetting agent has been added to allow the water to penetrate the interior of lie aerogel particles so that they sink in the aqueous medium. Topically, the addition of more than about 06 to 0.8 parts by wt wetting agent to about 1 part by wt aerogel can result in full wetting of the hydrophobb aerogel particles. However, when the aqueous slurry is substantially dried, the fully wetted particles can exhibit a targe increase in particle bulk density. As a consequence, the thermal conductivity of the composite material made with felly wetted aerogel particles tends to have higher thermal conductivities,<br>
(0029] In order to satisfactorily recover the hydrophobic- and low density of the hydrophobic aerogel particles, it is preferable to use an amount of wetting agent to only wet the outer surface layers of the hydrophobic aerogel particles, Tbus, a sufficient amount of wetting agent can be present to be adsorbed on the outer surface of the aerogels particles. When the outer surface layers of the aerogel particles are only wetted, there may be a negligible increase in the bulk density of the aerogel particles on drying. As a consequence, the hydrophobicity of the hydrophobic aerogel particles is relatively unaffected and the composite material tends to have a low thermal conductivity. Thus, preferably about 0.6 parts by wt or less wetting agent to about 1 part aerogel by wt is used. For instance, 0,05 partto about 0.5 parts by wt wetting agent can be used to about 1 part by wt aerogel The wetting agent can be pre-applied to the aerogel, or can be introduced into the shiny preferably prior to, at the same time, or after the aerogel is added,<br>
[0930] The amount of wetting agent required to only cause the wetting of the outer surface layers of the aerogel particles can depend an the size of the hydrophobic aeroge]<br><br>
particles. In general, particles of smaller size require more wetting agents. Preferably, the wetting agent is in an amount sufficient to allow substantial recovery of the hydrophobictty and low density of the hydrophobic aerogels after diying. More preferably, the wetting agent is in an amount sufficient for the final composite material to have a thermal conductivity of le$s than about 40 mW/m% and, most preferably, to have a thermal conductivity of fiora about 10 to about 30 mW/m°K, such as from about 12 to about 25 mW/meK. [0031] Typically? -- ab01- °-l to a 0.4 parts by wt wetting agent (added to water or other aqueous solution) to one part of aerogel can provide, after optional vigorous shaking and/or stirring, an aqueous slurry that can be substantially free of floating particles while bring stiired. However, upon standing, the slurry can separate into two layers, a bottom aerogel-free aqueous layer and a top layer of surface wetted aerogel particles. [0032] The rase at which the separation takes place can depend on the wetting agenMo-aerogel weight ratio, the aerogel particle size and on the viscosity of the slurry, which, in turn, can depend on its solids contort. The higher the solids content the longer the time it takes for the separation process to occur When a minimum amount of wetting agent is employed and the solids content of an aerogel/fiber shirty approaches about 5 to about 10 wt% solids, the slurry can be sufficiently viscous that the separation process can either be inhibited or take place over many hours. As the amount of wetting agent employed is increased, the rate of separation decreases. Accordingly, fiber/aerogel separation can be minimized by adjusting-solids, aerogel particle size and wetting agent levels so thai the time of separation is long compared to the dewatering time required to form a dried mixture [0033] Tbe fibers can be natural fibers, synthetic fibers, or both. The fibrous formation can contain at least one thermoplastic fibrous material with which the aerogel particle can be attached and by which the fibers can be connected to each other in the formation in such a way that the theimoplastiic fibers at the surface arc fused and, on cooling, result in a joining<br><br><br>
wherein R represents an alkyiene or polymethylene having 2 to 6 carbon atoms or phenyl, and R1 represents an alkyi group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, aiyl, or aralkyl. Preferably, in the fommla above, R represents ethylene and R1 represents methyl, ethyl, phenyl, or o-, m-, or p-methyl-phenyl, and, mare preferably, methyl.<br>
[0039] With respect to the fibers in general, the diameter of the Shears that are used fa the blanket can be any size. Preferably, the diameter of the fibers is smaller than the mean diameter of the aerogel particles, so that a high proportion of aerogel can be bound into the blanket The selection of very fine diameter fibers in place of larger diameter fibers makes it possible to produce mats of comparble strength at reduced fiber levels. Preferred fibers are those that have diameters of less than about 20 microns (e.g- from about 1 microns to about 18 microns) and have lengths that axe much laiger than the particle diameter (e.g., from about 200 microns to about 10,000 microns).<br>
[0040] The choice of fiber diameter and/or fiber material can reduce the radiation contribution to the thermal conductivity and can achieve increased mechanical strength. [0041] The individual fiber denier of the fibers can be selected within very wide limits. Preferably, the denier is below about 16 dtex, and, more preferably, below about 6 dtex. Most preferred fibers are the bicomponent fibers of deniers below 4 and cut lengths in excess of 4 mm.<br>
[0042]      The fibers can have any shape. The fibers can be round, triloba!, pentalobal, octalobal, in the fonn of strips, or be shaped Iflee fir trees, dumb bells, or otherwise- Hollow fibers can also be used. Additionally, the fiber materials can be smooth or crimped. [0043]      The fibers can be modified by conventional additives; for example, anti-static<br><br>
agents such as carbon blade The fibers can also contain IR opacifies such as carbon black, titanium dioxide, iron oxide, or zirconium dioxide, as well as mixtures of these, in order to reduce the radiation contribution to thermal conductivity. The fibers may also be dyed to have a color. [0044]      The radiation contribution to the thermal conductivity can be further reduced by<br>
w<br>
using blackened fibers, such as polyester fibers blackened with carbon black or simply carbon fibers. Carbon black can also be added to the composition. The mechanical strength of the article obtained after drying can also be influenced by the length and distribution of the fibers in the composition.<br>
[0045} In order to reduce the increase in thermal conductivity caused by the added fibers, the proportion (by weight) of the fibers must be held to the smallest amount required to achieve the desired blanket strength. The amount of fiber required depends on its density, diameter, length and, especially, its bonding properties and can be from about 15 % to about 70% and, preferably, from about 20% to about 60%. The thermal conductivity of the fiber material can be from about 0,1 to about 1 WAtfK and, preferably, less than about 1 WfmJL [0046] in one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention relates to a slutry containing aerogel and at least one type of wetting agent with or without fibers. In a farther embodiment of the presort invention, the present invention relates to an aerogel coated or wetted with at least one wetting agent or dispersant The aerogel particles can be fully wetted, partially wetted (e-, surface wetting), or be present in a slurry. The details of die components and amounts are as described above. The slurry or aerogel coated with a wetting agent can be useful as a way to easily introduce hydrophobic aerogel into a variety of materials, such as wet cement, concrete, or other aqueous-containing fluids, slurries, or materials, which can optionally harden to fonn solid materials. The aexogel wetted with at<br>
least one wetting agent or the sluny containing the aerogel with at least one wetting agent<br><br>
permits the easy introduction and uniform distribution of hydrophobic aerogel. The types, amounts, and the like of the aerogel and wetting agent, as described above, apply equally here to these embodiments.<br>
[0047] The preferred process for making the composite material of the present invention is an aqueous based nonwoven (e.g- wetlaid) process. The composition can be prepared by mixing the aerogel particles, the fibers, at least one wetting agent and/or any additional additives with the aqueous solution (e.g., water). This mixing can be earned out in any desired manner. Thus, the components can be introduced simultaneously into the mixing apparatus, or sequentially or in. any order. Additionally, an aqueous dispersion of a.suitable fiber that was previously made can be added to a stirred slurry of the surface-wetted aerogels that was previously made to yield an intimate mixture of the two components There is also no restriction on the mixing apparatus necessary for the mixing. Any mixing apparatus known for this purpose to a person skilled in the art can be used. [0048] The mixing operation preferably provides distribution of the aerogel particles amongst the fibers preseaat in the composition. The distribution can be uniform. The mixing duration can vary depending on the speed of the stirring device, the size of fibers and aerogel particles, the amount of wetting agent present, and other variables, such as temperature.<br>
[0049] To create a relatively dust-free blanket with lew thennal conductivity, it is preferable that the proportion by weight of the fibers be as anal! as possible but sufficient to hold the aerogeL Accordingly, the weight of fiber required can depend on its density, self-bonding characteristics, diameter, length, and the Kke, and can, typically, be greater than 15%, Preferably, the proportion by weight of the fibers is from about 20% to about 70% by<br>
weight Other amounts can be used. More preferably, for bicomponent fibers the weight of the fibers is about 30% for glass fibers is about 50% and about 40% for an equal weight<br><br>
mixture of the two. Additionally, the proportion by weigttt ot me aerogels is preieraoiy irom about 30% to about 80%. Other amounts can be used<br>
[0050] The slurry can then be dewatered by any known method such as a wire screen, filtering, and the like. To ensure minimal fiber/aerogel separation because of density differences, geitie stirring can be continued during dewaiaring. Preferably, the slurry is dewatercd by filtering on a wire using a wetlaid technique which is known to those skilled in the art For instance, see ILS Patent No. 5,399,422, incorporated in its entirety by reference herein,<br>
[0051] The blanket of the present invention can optionally include two or more layers to form a multi-layered or "sandwich" structure, which can include three or more layers. Each layer can have any thickness and/or aerogel-to-fiber weight ratio The structure can include a relatively thin top and bottom layers having a relatively lower aerogeMo-fiber weight ratio ' than Hie intermediate layer, and a relatively thick intermediate layer having a large aerogel-to-fiber weight ratio than the top and bottom layers. Such structures can be readily made " using cylinder machines of the type used in making cardboards. [0052] A multi-layered or sandwich structure can be made any way, such as pre-fanning each layer and then laninaffag ihem together. Or, the layers can be formed in sequence by in situ methods.

can be-prepared and filtered to form a first layer. A second shiny having a different aerogel-to-fiber weight ratio can ftca be prepared- intoduced, and filtered through the first filtered mixture to form a second layer on file first layer. After the second slurry is at least filtered through the first filtered mixture, a third slurry having the same or different aerogel~to-fiber weight ratio from the first slurry can be prepared and introduced through the first and<br>
second filtered mixtures to form a third layer on either the first or second layer side.<br>
[0053]      Hie resulting filtered mixture or mixtures can then be pressed to remove water<br><br>
and increase web density, dried at a predetermined temperature and pressure and be calendared at a predetermined temperature and/or pressure to form the blanket of the present invention. The filtered mixture of aerogel particles and fibers can be pressed and dried at a predetermined temperature by any known method and/or instrument Rotary presses can be used for web dewatering and compression. Drying can be accomplished by steam-heated cylinders or by high velocity air drying or by radiant heat Preferably, the filtered mixture is dried at a temperature at which the wetting agent volatizes or decomposes so that the hydrophobic- of the hydrophobic aerogel particles is satisfactorily recovered Additionally, the drying process can also cause some or all of the fibers to bond to one another and/or to the aerogels Preferably, the filtered mixture is further dried at a temperature of at least about 100 °C and, more preferably, at a temperature of at least about 120 °C. [0054] The dried mixture, which can be in the form of a web, can then be, at least partially, further thermally bonded wife a hot calendar preferably a hot calendar roll, to form a strong and relatively dust-free blanket or composite material. The dried mixture/web can also be calendared to a predetermined density at a predetermined temperature and lime. Preferably, sufficient temperature and pressure is applied during the calendaring process to form a blanket having a density of from about 0,07 g/cc to about 0.16 g/cc. Depending on the desired density of the blanket, the temperature and time of the hot calendaring can vary, [O055J Jh the present invention, typically, the blanket containing the fibers and aerogel has significant fiber-fiber contact due to the preferred process of making the blanket containing the aerogel and fibers, hi addition, the aerogel that is present in the blanket or distributed throughout the matrix of fibers in the blanket substantially maintains its shape and other morphology characteristics. In other words, using the preferred process of the present Invention, one can start with an aerogel of known structure of known morphology, and other properties, and substantially maintain these properties once present in the blanket<br><br>
containing the aerogel and fibers. This is different ftom forming the aerogel irb-situ with the fibers, thus not being able to control or obtain desirable structure or other characteristics. [0056] As stated above, preferably, the blanket of the present invention contains non-woven fibers-with aerogel, such as aerogel particles. Another way to describe the present invention is a blanket of non-woven fabric containing aerogel particles. Typically, the fabric is matif from staple lengths of cotton, rayon, glass, or thermoplastic synthetic fibers which are mechanically positioned, preferably, in a random manner. Hie fibers can be bonded with an adhesive, such as synthetic adhesive or rubber latex. One or more sheets of the non-woven fabric can be formed and can be pressed together along with the aerogel particles to form mats. Generally, permanent bonds are formed when the fibers touch each other as a result of heat treatment, especially when the fibers are thermoplastics or permanent bonds can be achieved by use of a binder or adhesive such as a high-polymer binder. The non-woven fabric can be or can contain more than one type of fiber, such as a combination of two different polymers or glass and polymeric fibers.<br>
[0057] The blanket of the present invention can optionally have, on at least one sidey at teast one covering layer to form a laminate in order to improve the properties of the surface, such as increasing its wear resistance, providing the surface with a vapor barrier, or protecting 1he surface from becoming soiled Covering layers can also improve the mechanical stability of the articles made from the composite material. If covering layers are used on both surfaces, these may be the same or different Suitable coveting layers can be any of the materials known to the person skilled in the art The covering layers may be non-porous and, thus, effective as a vapor bairier; examples are plastic films, metal foils or metallized plastic films that reflect heat radiation. Porous covering layers, which permit the ingress of air into the material can also be used. Examples of porous covering layers are porous films, papers, fabrics, and webs. The matrix material Itself can also be used as a<br><br>
covering layer. Preferably, the covering layer is a polymeric film, such as a polyester, polymethane, and the like, or a thin fiberglass mat or blanket The covering layer(s) can be applied to the blankets by a variety of methods, in addition to the in situ methods already mentioned, these methods include the following: 1. Forming the blanket on a scrim and/or placing a scrim on the wet blanket followed by<br>
compression and drying  The scrim may be composed of a polymeric or a fiberglass<br>
mat 1 Placement of a porous or non-porous thermoplastic film on the surface of the dried<br>
blanket followed by hot calendaring at temperatures sufficient to cause bonding of the<br>
covering layers) to the blanket Bonding can be further facilitated by use of hot-melt<br>
adhesives. [0058}      Since the covering layers) is/arc typically more thermally conductive than the aerogel containing matrix, the thickness of the covering 3ayer(s) should be much smaller than that of the matrix- Preferably, the oovering layer® have a thickness of about 0,04 mm or less, such as 0.005 mm to 0.04 mm.<br>
[0059] la several embodiments of the present invention, the present invention relates to a panel structure having at least two layers of glass wherein the layers of glass are separated by a gap. The aerogel blanket or mat of the present invention at least partially fills or is located in this gap to provide numerous benefits including thermal insulation. The aerogel blanket or mat generally can have a tMfcctor of .35 or less and a solar heat gain coefficient of ,4 or less- The visible transmittance (VT) can be 0.90 or less or 0.75 or less. Thus, m at least one embodiment of the present invention, the present invention relates to double-glazed windows or structures wife glass as the inner and outer layers and the air gap in between being replaced at least in part wife the aerogel blanket or mat of the present invention. The gap can be any conventional size such as -from about 2 mm to about 10 mm<br><br>
or more The size of the panel structure can be any conventional size for instance, from 1 m or less to 5 m or more in. length or in width or both. The layers of glass that are used can be clear glass, tinted glass, high-perfbnnance tinted glass, bigh-solar-gain low-E glass, or other variations. The panel structure can have three or more glazing layers, and one or more gaps can contain the aerogel blanket or mat of the present invention. The three or more or triple glazed panel structure can have layers of plastic or other polymer layers or fibers as one of the layers, such as the middle glazing layer.<br>
[0060] With respect to the aerogel blanket or mat, more than one aerogel blanket or mat can be used in the gap to form multiple layers of aerogel blankets or mats or a single blanket or mat can be used. The aerogel blanket or mat thickness can be a thickness that is the same thickness as the gap or it can be smaller. In other words, the blanket or mat can fill in the entire gap or some space can be left for air or other gases, such as krypton gas or argon gas or other materials.<br>
[0061] The use of the aerogel mat or blanket offers numerous advantages. For instance, if aerogel particles were simply poured into the gap between the two layers of glass, there are numerous problems created by this use of aerogel. First, the particulate aerogel is difficult to handle. Second, the aerogel particles are difficult to introduce in between two layers of glass during the manuthcturing process. Also, when particulate aerogel is located between two layers of glass in a window structure, when the glass expands, the aerogel can be subjected to pressures which can break the aerogel particulates and therefore degrades the insulating value of the aerogeL Ike present invention overcomes these difficulties by using an aerogel blanket or mat which provides a stable carrier for the aerogeL Unlike particulate aerogel which would need to be entirely introduced into the gap and one would need to ensure that sufficient aerogel particulate is present to totally fill the gap top to bottom, the aerogel blanket or mat of the present invention provides a structure wherein the aerogel<br><br>
particulates are substantially uniformly distributed throughout the mat such feat aerogel is<br>
present throughout the gap and is adequately suspended in the blanket or mat lius, the<br>
suspended aerogel, along wife the fibers presort in the blanket or met, ofier enough room<br>
and flexibility such that when the glass layers expand or contract, the aerogel present in the<br>
blanket or mat is not crushed and therefore is not subjected to breakage. In other words,<br>
there is sufficient room or "give in the blanket or mat such that the aerogel does not break.<br>
In addition, the use of the blanket or mat offers an easy means to introduce the aerogel in<br>
between two layers of glass or other material during the manufectotang process. Also, there<br>
are no problems wife the settling of aerogel since the aerogel is suspended in a blanket or<br>
mat<br>
[0062]      In addition, the blanket or mat can be clamped with a combination of materials<br>
such as spacers, festners and/or adhesives, or other materials or elements to add rigidity to<br>
the blanket or mat so feat the blanket or mat does not bend once it is present in the gap<br>
between the layers of glass or other material.<br>
[0063]      In lieu of layers of glass, certainly it is within the embodiments of the present<br>
invention, to use other layers of material which are adequate substitutes for glass, such as<br>
polymers and the like-<br>
[0064]     For purposes of the embodiments of the present invention, the aerogel blanket or<br>
mat can be prepared in any feshioa, including the methods described above relating to the<br>
use of an aqneous sluny. However, other means can be used to prepare the aerogel mat or<br>
blanket<br>
[0065]      The blanket located between the two layers of glass or other material is then<br>
hermetically sealed wife the two layers of glass to fonn an overall panel structure.  The<br>
means to hermetically seal the structure are conventional and known to those skilled in the<br>
art  The panel structure of the present invention can be used for a variety of different<br><br>
windows and doors and alter structures which require some light transmission. The framing<br>
of the structure can be with any conventional material, such as metal wood, polymer, and<br>
the like. As with conventional window frames, the shape of the panel structure can be in any<br>
conventional window or door shape.<br>
[0066]     In general, the blanket of the present invention can be used for a variety of uses<br>
including insulation uses including applications requiring thermal insulation, such as at<br>
temperatures of 1000°C to 1200 °C or higher. For instance, and merely as examples, the<br>
blanket of the present invention can be used as an insulating material for pipes, such as a<br>
double-casing pipe, insulation for aircraft and parts thereof building insulation, aerospace<br>
insulation, automotive insulation, clothing insulation, footwear insulation, and the like.<br>
Essentially, the present invention can be used in the same manner as aerogel mats or where a<br>
plurality of aerogels are used. .<br>
[0067]      In addition, with respect to the aerogel containing a wetting agent with or<br>
without fibers, the present invention can be used in construction materials, such as in<br>
cement, concrete, and foam, such as syntactic foams. Generally, conventional amounts of<br>
these materials can be used in these various applications. The aerogel can be present in<br>
amounts to achieve desired insulation properties.<br>
(0068]     The present invention will be fimher clarified by the following examples which<br>
are intended to be purely exemplary of the present invention,<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
[0069]     The weights of given volumes of aerogel of two mean particle sizes were<br>
determined from which their bulk densities were evaluated The particles were then either<br>
fully or partially (Lex, primarily the outer surface layers) wetted by vigorous overnight shaking with water containing Bariox 12i surfectanL Full and partial wetting were<br><br>
accomplished by addition to each part of aerogel 0,8 and 0.2 parts by wight of the wetting agent, respectively The slurries were dried and the volumes of the resulting dry powders werth determined The bulk densities of the aerogel particles before and after wetting are summarized in Table L The data indicates that there is a considerable increase in bulk density when the particles are wetted with 08 parts of wetting agent In contrast, when a reduced amount of wetting agent (0.2 parts) was employed, the particle bulk densities were only slightly larger than those of the initial samples. The result indicates that the density of the hydrophobic aerogel is recovered/restored wheal the slurries are substantially dried. Experimental woric has shown that use of 0.1 parts by weight of Barlox 12i surfactant is sufficient to cause wetting of aerogel particles with mean sizes larger than about 30 ftm. As such, with just small levels of wetting agent, fall recovery of the hydrophobic characteristics of the aerogel particles can be expected on drying of the surface-wetted aerogel particles.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
[0070] The sarfece layers of aerogel particles of two mean sizes were wetted with water containing Barlox 12i surfactant The resulting slurries were then combined with an aqueous dispersion of Kosa type 105 Wcomponent fibers (3 denier, 0.64 mm cut length sheath melting temperature of 128 -C), and then vacuum filtered through a 0.203 by 0203 m2 (8-iash by 8-inch) fennel. Aerogel mean particle size and weights of aerogel, fiber, and Barlox 12i employed axe listed in Table 2. The aerogel was dispersed in about 750 ml of water/Bariox 12i solution by shaking and then stirring until complete wetting took place<br><br>
(determined when no powder floated on the surface of the vigorously stirred shiny). The Kosa fibers were dispersed in about 1.5 liters of water by gentle stirring. These were then added to the aerogel slurry, stirred for about a minute and then filtered. To ensure minimal fiber/aerogel separation because of density differences, gentle stirring was continued during filtration until about 13 liters of filtrate was obtained, after which stirring was discontinued.<br><br>
[0071] Several mats were made at each composition. Hot pressing the mats to a specified thickness at 140 QC for 15 minutes resulted in a considerable gain in strength. The tendency for the aerogel to M out of the mat increases as its fiber content is reduced. Mats containing 33 wt% fiber were relatively dust-free.<br>
[0072] The top and bottom sides of the dried mats were covered with 25 -m thick polyester films. The mats were then either hot-pressed at 140 °C for 15 minutes to differing thicknesses, or the same mat was hot-pressed to successively smaller thicknesses. A good bond was fonned between the mat and the polyester films so that the mats became dusHree. The thermal conductivities of the mats were evaluated at a mean temperature of 12i °C using a Lasercomp Fox 200 heat flow instrument (0 °C cold side and 25 °C warn side). The bulk densities of the samples, together with their thermal conductivities, are listed in Table<br><br><br>
[0073] The data in the table indicates that for each composition there is an optimum blanket density for minimum thermal conductivity. Although there is some scatter in the data, at the same blanket density thermal conductivity decreases as the blanket aerogel content and mean aerogel particle size increase. However, the differences in performance between compositions containing 29 and 25 wt% fiber are small. The data suggests that, for<br><br><br>
[0074] 22-5 g of aerogel was vigorously shaken and then stirred wife 400ml of water containing 52S g of 30 wt% Barlox 12i wetting agent until a uniform slurry that did not separate on standing was formed This slurry was added to a dispersion of 33.75 g of Johns Manville Q-fibers in 3 liters of water. The combined slurry was filtered on a 13-inch diameter Budmer. The resulting nutt was then dried and theahested to 130 CC to remove the wetting agent A OJ203 by 0.203 m2 (8-inch by JMnch) section was cut out of the mat for thermal conductivity evaluation. Additional mats having the same composition were formed and pressed to differing densities. The thermal conductivities of the various blankets and their densities are listed in Table 4. The thermal conductivities of these mats, regardless of mat density, are much larger than those listed in Table 3. Since the volume of the Q fibers to aerogel employed was not substantially larger than the volume of Kosa fiber to aerogel, the increased thennal conductivity is attributed to the effect increased density of fully wetted<br><br><br><br>
[0077]      2) A second slurry having the composition of step #1 was prepared [0078]      3) 24.75 g of aerogel was dispersed in 750 ml of water curtaining 825 g of 30 wttt Barlox by vigorous shaking and subsequent stirring. The product was then combined with a slurry consisting of 825 g of the Kosa type 255 fiber in 15 liters of water that was formed by gentle stirring.<br>
[0079] Slurry #1 was mixed weD and then vacuum filtered through a 0203 by 0203 m2 (8-inch by 8-mch) funnel until a mat that was free of surface water was formed. Slurry #3 was mixed well and then filtered through the mat of slurry #1, Finally, well-mixed slurry #2 was filtered through the mat of slurry #3- Tlius, a three-layered structure was fanned. The mat was dried at 100 °C and then hot pressed at 140 6C to various densities. The resulting mats had good strengdis. Their thermal conductivities at the various mat densities are listed in Table 5. It is expected that further optimization of the mat structure, such as by reducing the thickness of the bottom and top layers, increasing their aerogel contents, and increasing the aerogel content of the intermediate layer, would form blankets with even smaller thermal conductivities.<br><br><br>
(0081J 1) 22 g of aerogel with a mean particle size of 65 μmwas dispersed in 750 ml of water containing 2 g of the Barlox dispersant (100 % basis) by vigorous shaking and stirring. Separately, 22 g of Laoscha B06F fiber (6 nm diameter) was dispersed in 3 liters of water by a dispersator. The fiberglass stony was first gently stirred, and then stirring speed was progressively increased (to about 10,000 RPM) after about 30 minutes. The aerogel/glass fiber dispersions were then combined and gently stirred The resulting slurry was filtered throttgh a 0.203 by 0.203 m2 (8-iach by 8-inck) fimneL Very rapid dewatemg took place. The mat was dried overnight at 120° C, weighed and then hot-pressed to successively higher densities (determined from blanket weight and thickness). The thermal conductivities of the mats were determined at each density.<br>
[0082]     2) Experiment 1 was repeated, except thai the fiber dispersion consisted of the<br>
LauschaB26R glass fibos.<br>
[0083]      3) Experiment 1 was repeated, except that the fiber dispersion consisted of 20 g<br>
of Lauscha B06F fibers and 2 g of Mraifibers EST8 polyethylene fibers. The polyethylene<br>
fibers were first dispersed by means of a Warring Blender in about 300 ml of water before<br>
being added to the glass fibers.<br>
[0084]      4)   Experiment 1 was repeated, except that the aerogel was replaced by an<br>
aerogel having a mean particle size of 1mm,<br>
[0085]      Tlie densities, thermal conductivities, and some characteristics of the mats are<br>
summarized in Table 6.<br><br><br>
Example 6<br>
10086]      Three separate slurries of Lauscha B06F glass fibers and partially wetted aerogel<br>
of mean particle size of 65 μmwas prepared using the following procedures:<br>
[00871       1) 25 g of aerogel was dispersed in 250 ml of water containing 0.83 g of 30<br>
wt% Barfox by vigorous shaking and subsequent stirring. The product was ttea combined<br>
(by stirring) with a shiny of 3 g of the Lauscha B06F fibers dispersed by dispereator ia 500<br>
ml of water.<br>
[0088]      2) A second slurry having the <br>
[0089]      3) 9 g of aerogel was dispersed in 750 ml of water containing 3 g of 30 wt%<br>
Barlox by vigorous shaking and subsequent stilling. This was then combined (by stirring)<br>
with a slurry consisting of 6 g of Lauscha B06F fibers in 1.5 liters of water dispersed by<br><br>
dispersator.<br>
[0090]       Slurry #1 was mixed well and then vacuum filtered through a 0.203 by 0.203 m2<br>
(8-inch by 8-inch) ftnnel until a mat that was free of surface water was formed. Slurry #3<br>
was mixed well and then filtered through the mat of stony #1, Finally, the well mixed slurry<br>
#2 was filtered through the mat of shiny #3, Thus, a three-layered structure was formed. The<br>
wet mat was compacted to a tbidkness of 0.635 cm (1/4) and dried at 125 °C Its thennal<br>
conductivity was evaluated and then hot-fressed at 140 C to various densities. The<br>
resulting mats had good strengths and ware essentially dust-free.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0091]      Three separate slurries of Lauscba B06F glass fibers, polyethylene, and partially<br>
wetted aerogel of mean particle size of 65 fira were prepared using the following<br>
procedures:<br>
[0092]      1) 2.5 g of aerogel was dispersed in 250 ml of water containing 0.83 g of 30<br>
wt% Barlox by vigorous Asking and subsequent stirring. The product was then combined<br>
(fay stirring) with a slurry of 1 g polyethylene, which was initially dispersed in a Warring<br>
Blender, and then added to 2 g of the Lauscha B06F fibers and subsequently dispersed by<br>
dispersator in 500 ml of water<br>
[0093]      2) A second slurry having the composition of slurry #1 was prepared,<br>
[0094]      3) 9 g of aerogel was dispersed in 750 ml of water containing 3 g of 30 wt%<br>
Barlox by vigorous shaking and subsequent stirring. The product was then combined (by<br>
stirring) with a slurry consisting of 6 g of Lauscha B06F fibers in 15 liters of water<br>
dispersed by dispersator.<br>
 [0095] Slurry #1 was mixed wfl and then vacuum filtered ftoough a 0203 by (X203 m2 (8-inch by 8-inch) funnel until a mat that was free of surface water was formed. Slurry #3 was mixed well and then filtered through the mat of slurry #L Finally, the well mixed slimy<br><br>
#2 was filtered through the mat of slurry #3 Thus, a three-layered structure was fonned. The wet mat was compacted to a thickness of 0.635 cm (1/4") and dried at 125 °C. Its thermal conductivity was evaluated and then hot-pressed at 140 CC to various densities. The resulting mats had good strengths and were essentially dust-free. The mats of Experiment 7 were somewhat stronger than those of Experiment 6. The mat thicknesses, densities, and thermal conductivities are summarized in Table 8.<br><br>
[0096) It is expected that father optimization of the mat structure, such as by reducing the thickness of the bottom and top layers, increasing their aerogel contents, and increasing the aerogel content of the intermediate layer, would form blankets with even smaller thermal conductivities at given overall blankest densities.<br>
