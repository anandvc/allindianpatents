population not presented with such a compound, if the treated population has a<br>
comparatively greater period of functionality than the non-treated population. As a further<br>
example, and again not by way of limitation, with respect to the function of, e.g., a sensory<br>
neuron, a compound of the present invention would evidence enhancement of the function<br>
(e.g. neurite extension) of a sensory neuronal population when compared to a sensory<br>
neuronal population not presented with such a compound, if the neurite extension of the<br>
treated population is comparatively greater than the neurite extension of the non-treated<br>

transmitters and/or singular or multiple functions; preferably, these are cholinergic and<br>
sensory neurons. As used herein, the phrase "cholinergic neuron" means neurons of the<br>
Central Nervous System (CNS) and Peripheral Nervous System (PNS) whose<br>
neurotransmitter is acetylcholine; exemplary are basal forebrain and spinal cord neurons.<br>

As used herein the terms "trophic factor activity" and "trophic factor-induced<br>
activity", refer to both endogenous and exogenous trophic factors, where "endogenous"<br>
refers to a trophic factor normally present and "exogenous" refers to a trophic factor added<br>
to a system. As defined, "trophic factor induced activity" includes activity induced by (1)<br>
endogenous trophic factors; (2) exogenous trophic factors; and (3) a combination of<br>
endogenous and exogenous trophic factors.<br>
As used herein, the term "at risk of dying" in conjunction with a biological<br>
material, e.g., a cell such as a neuron, refers to a state or condition which negatively<br>
impacts the biological material such that the material has an increased likelihood of dying<br><br>
due to such state or condition. For example, compounds disclosed herein can '"rescue" or<br>
enhance the survival of motoneurons which are naturally at risk of dying in an in ovo<br>
model of programmed cell death. Similarly, for example, a neuron may be at risk of dying<br>
due to the natural aging process which occasions the death of a neuron, or due to an injury,<br>
such as a trauma to the head, which may be such that neurons and/or glia, for example,<br>
impacted by such trauma may be at risk of dying. Further, for example, a neuron may be<br>
at risk of dying due to a disease state or condition, as in the case of neurons at risk of<br>
dying as occasioned by the disease ALS. Thus, by enhancing the survival of a cell at risk<br>
of dying by use of a compound of the claimed invention is meant that such compound<br>
decreases or prevents the risk of the death of the cell.<br>
As used herein the term "contacting" refers to directly or indirectly causing<br>
placement together of moieties, such that the moieties directly or indirectly come into<br>
physical association with each other, whereby a desired outcome is achieved. Thus, as<br>
used herein, one can "contact" a target cell with a compound as disclosed herein even<br>
though the compound and cell do not necessarily physically join together (as, for example,<br>
is the case where a ligand and a receptor physically join together), as long as the desired<br>
outcome is achieved (e.g., enhancement of the survival of the cell). Contacting thus<br>
includes acts such as placing moieties together in a container (e.g., adding a compound as<br>
disclosed herein to a container comprising cells for in vitro studies) as well as<br>
administration of the compound to a target entity (e.g., injecting a compound as disclosed<br>
herein into a laboratory animal for in vivo testing, or into a human for therapy or treatment<br>
purposes).<br>
As used herein, a "therapeutically effective amount" refers to an amount of a<br>
compound of the present invention effective to prevent or treat the symptoms of a<br>
particular disorder.<br>
As used herein, the term "subject" refers to a warm blooded animal such as a<br>
mammal, preferably a human, or a human child, which is afflicted with, or has the<br>
potential to be afflicted with one or more diseases and conditions described herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable" refers to those compounds,<br>
materials, compositions, and/or dosage forms which are, within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgment, suitable for contact with the tissues of human beings and animals<br><br>
without excessive toxicity, irritation, allergic response, or other problem complications<br>
commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio.<br>
As used herein, "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refer to derivatives of the<br>
disclosed compounds wherein the parent compound is modified by making acid or base<br>
salts thereof. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral or organic acid salts of basic residues such as amines; alkali or organic salts of<br>
acidic residues such as carboxylic acids; and the like. The pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include the conventional non-toxic salts or the quaternary ammonium salts of the<br>
parent compound formed, for example, from non-toxic inorganic or organic acids. For<br>
example, such conventional non-toxic salts include those derived from inorganic acids<br>
such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric, nitric and the like; and<br>
the salts prepared from organic acids such as acetic, propionic, succinic, glycolic, stearic,<br>
lactic, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, pamoic, maleic, hydroxymaleic, phenylacetic,<br>
glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, sulfanilic, 2-acetoxybenzoic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic,<br>
methanesulfonic, ethane disulfonic, oxalic, isethionic, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the present invention can be prepared<br>
from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by conventional<br>
chemical methods. Generally, such salts can be prepared by reacting the free acid or base<br>
forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in<br>
water or in an organic solvent, or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media<br>
like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, or acetonitrile are preferred. Lists of<br>
suitable salts are found in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 17th ed., Mack<br>
Publishing Company, Easton, PA, 1985, p. 1418, the disclosure of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
As used herein, the term "unit dose" refers to a single dose which is capable of<br>
being administered to a patient, and which can be readily handled and packaged,<br>
remaining as a physically and chemically stable unit dose comprising either the active<br>
compound itself, or as a pharmaceutically acceptable composition, as described<br>
hereinafter.<br>
As used herein, "prodrug" is intended to include any covalently bonded carriers<br>
which release the active parent compound as defined in the present invention in vivo when<br><br>
such prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject. Since prodrugs are known to<br>
enhance numerous desirable qualities of pharmaceuticals (e.g.. solubility, bioavailability,<br>
manufacturing, etc.) the compounds of the present invention may be delivered in prodrug<br>
form. Thus, the present invention contemplates prodrugs of the claimed compounds,<br>
compositions containing the same, and methods of delivering the same. Prodrugs of a<br>
compound of the present invention may be prepared by modifying functional groups<br>
present in the compound in such a way that the modifications are cleaved, either in routine<br>
manipulation or in vivo, to the parent compound. Accordingly, prodrugs include, for<br>
example, compounds of the present invention wherein a hydroxy, amino, or carboxy group<br>
is bonded to any group that, when the prodrug is administered to a mammalian subject,<br>
cleaves to form a free hydroxyl, free amino, or carboxylic acid, respectively. Examples<br>
include, but are not limited to, acetate, formate and benzoate derivatives of alcohol and<br>
amine functional groups; and alkyl, carbocyclic, aryl, and alkylaryl esters such as methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, cyclopropyl, phenyl, benzyl,<br>
and phenethyl esters, and the like.<br>
It is recognized that compounds of the present invention may exist in various<br>
stereoisomeric forms. As such, the compounds of the present invention include their<br>
respective diastereomers or enantiomers. The compounds are normally prepared as<br>
racemates and can conveniently be used as such, but individual diastereomers or<br>
enantiomers can be isolated or synthesized by conventional techniques if so desired. Such<br>
racemates and individual diastereomers or enantiomers and mixtures thereof form part of<br>
the present invention.<br>
It is well known in the art how to prepare and isolate such optically active forms.<br>
Specific stereoisomers can be prepared by stereospecific synthesis using enantiomerically<br>
pure or enantiomerically enriched starting materials. The specific stereoisomers of either<br>
starting materials or products can be resolved and recovered by techniques known in the<br>
art, such as resolution of racemic forms, normal, reverse-phase, and chiral<br>
chromatography, recrystallization, enzymatic resolution, or fractional recrystallization of<br>
addition salts formed by reagents used for that purpose. Useful methods of resolving and<br>
recovering specific stereoisomers described in Eliel, E. L.; Wilen, S.H. Stereochemistry of<br>
Organic Compounds; Wiley: New York, 1994, and Jacques, J, et al. Enantiomers,<br><br>
Racemates, and Resolutions: Wiley: New York, 1981, each incorporated by reference<br>
herein in their entireties.<br>
It is further recognized that functional groups present on the compounds of the<br>
present invention may contain protecting groups. For example, the amino acid side chain<br>
substituents of the compounds of the present invention can be substituted with protecting<br>
groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl or t-butoxycarbonyl groups. Protecting groups are<br>
known per se as chemical functional groups that can be selectively appended to and<br>
removed from functionalities, such as hydroxyl groups and carboxyl groups. These<br>
groups are present in a chemical compound to render such functionality inert to chemical<br>
reaction conditions to which the compound is exposed. Any of a variety of protecting<br>
groups may be employed with the present invention. Preferred groups for protecting<br>
lactams include silyl groups such as t-butyldimethylsilyl ("TBDMS"),<br>
dimethoxybenzhydryl ("DMB"), acyl, benzyl ("Bn"), and methoxybenzyl groups.<br>
Preferred groups for protecting hydroxy groups include TBS, acyl, benzyl,<br>
benzyloxycarbonyl ("CBZ"), t-butyloxycarbonyl ("Boc"), and methoxymethyl. Many<br>
other standard protecting groups employed by one skilled in the art can be found in<br>

Synthesis<br>
The general routes to prepare the examples shown in Tables 1-3 of the present<br>
invention are shown in the Schemes 1-18. The intermediates used to prepare the examples<br>
and their mass spectra] data are shown in the Table B. The reagents and starting materials<br>
are commercially available, or readily synthesized by well-known techniques by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the arts. All processes disclosed in association with the present invention<br>
are contemplated to be practiced on any scale, including milligram, gram, multigram,<br>
kilogram, multikilogram or commercial industrial scale. All substituents in the synthetic<br>
schemes, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The general procedures to prepare the pyrrolocarbazoles of the present invention<br>
are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,705,511 ("the '511 patent") and 6,630,500, PCTPubl.<br>
No. WO 00/47583, /. Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2001. 38, 591, and J. Heterocyclic<br>
Chemistry, 2003, 40, 135. In general, the lactam nitrogen or intermediate alcohol groups<br>
of the intermediates outlined in Table B may be protected with such groups as acetyl,<br>
substituted silyl, benzyl, Boc, or dimethoxybenzhydrol.<br>
Intermediate 1-20 containing a 2-methyl-pyrazole F-ring, used to prepare examples<br>
in Table 2, was prepared from the (3-ketone, 2-methyl-l,4,6,7-tetrahydro-5#-indazol-5-<br>
one (Peet, N. P.; LeTourneau, M. E.; Heterocycles, 1991, 32, 41) using methods described<br>
in the '511 patent and in /. Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2003, 4(&gt;, 135.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme 1, the Nl-methyl pyraz jk derivatives in Table 3 were<br>
prepared from the 1-methyl cc-ketone (J. Chem. Re. ., 1986, 1401). The N2-methyl<br>
pyrazole intermediates were prepared according to procedures in J. Heterocyclic Chem.<br>
1992,19, 1355.<br><br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 2, Examples 1-6 may be prepared from intermediate 1-1 by<br>
converting the hydroxymethyl group, using trifluoroacetic anhydride, to an activated per-<br>
trifluoroacetate intermediate. This intermediate may be further reacted in situ with an<br>
alcohol, amine or amide to produce the appropriate product. In certain cases the alcohol<br>
may serve as the solvent, otherwise suitable solvents also include methylene chloride,<br>
dichloroethane or toluene. The hydroxymethyl intermediates may be readily prepared by<br>
reduction of the corresponding aldehyde or ester intermediate as described in U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,630,500 and herein. Alternatively the derivatives may be prepared by treating the<br>
hydroxymethyl intermediate 1-1 with an acid catalyst, such as camphor sulfonic acid,<br>
trifluoroacetic acid or p-toluene sulfonic acid, in the presence of the appropriate alcohol in<br>
a suitable solvent such as methylene chloride or dichloromethane.<br><br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 3, the heterocycloalkyl derivatives may be prepared by<br>
reacting the ester intermediate 1-2 with ethanolamine. Longer chain amino alcohols, such<br>
i.', 3-aminopropanol and 4-aminobutanol, produce the corresponding ring-expanded six or<br>
seven-membered heterocycloalkyl groups. Ethylene diamine and longer alkyl chain<br>
diamines may be used to produce the analogous imidazoline and ring-expanded diamine<br>
heterocycloalkyl derivatives.<br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 4, Examples 9-11 and 328-329 were prepared by reacting<br>
an appropriate keto-ester intermediate, prepared using standard Friedel-Crafts acylation<br>
reactions (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,630,500 and herein) with a hydrazine or an N-<br>
substituted hydrazine derivative.<br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 5, Example 8 was prepared from the cc, (3-unsaturated ester<br>
(prepared by a Heck reaction with ethyl acrylate, described in the '511 patent) with<br><br>
hydrazine. An N-substituted hydrazine derivative may be used to produce the N-<br>
substituted derivative.<br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 6, the cyclic acetal and cyclic thioacetal Examples 12-28<br>
and 232-235 were prepared by reacting an aldehyde or alkyl-ketone intermediate with a a&gt;-<br>
diol, di-thiol or hydroxyl-thiol reagent and an acid catalyst such as CSA or p-toluene<br>
sulfonic acid in a suitable aprotic solvent such as toluene, benzene, or NMP. The diol or<br>
dithiol reagent may have substitutions on the alkyl chain such as in Examples 14, 15, 18-<br>
24, and 28. The thioether derivatives may be converted to sulfoxides or sulfones using<br>
standard oxidizing reagents such as hydrogen peroxide or mCPBA.<br><br><br>
As outlined in Scheme 7, cycloalkyl and heterocycloalkyl ketone derivatives and<br>
cycloalkyl alkyl and heterocycloalkyl alkyl derivatives, such as in examples 32-38 may be<br>
prepared by treating the appropriate pyrrolocarbazole with an appropriate acid chloride,<br>
carboxylic acid, mixed carboxylic sulfonic anhydride or mixed carboxylic acid anhydride,<br>
in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as AICI3, or FeCl3 in a solvent such as<br>
methylene chloride, dichloroethane, nitromethane, nitrobenzene or carbon disulfide. The<br>
resulting ketone can be reduced to the alcohol using standard reducing agents such as<br>
sodium borohydride (as in Example 37) or LiAlHU. The hydroxy group of the cycloalkyl<br>
or heterocycloalkyl alcohols may be replaced with hydrogen by treatment with<br>
trifluoroacetic acid and triethyl silane (as in Example 38 and 309) in methylene chloride.<br><br><br>
Scheme 8 outlines a route to heterocycloalkenyl derivatives, such as Examples 39-<br>
42. The alkene may be further reduced by standards chemical or catalytic hydrogenation<br>
methods to the corresponding heterocycloalkyl derivative.<br><br><br>
Scheme 9 outlines a route for the preparation of substituted or unsubstituted 2-, 3-,<br>
or 4-piperdinyl derivatives, such as Example 43. From intermediate I-12? the pyridyl ring<br>
may be catalytically reduced to the saturated piperidyl using a Raney nickel catalyst.<br>
Alternatively, using methods described for Examples 44 and 45, the piperidinyl may be<br>
incorporated by Stille or Suzuki coupling reactions using the appropriate piperidinyl<br>
stannane or borate and followed by a reduction to the saturated piperidinyl. The<br>
piperidinyl nitrogen may be alkylated by standard alkylation reactions as described for<br>
Examples 46-48. Standard aryl or heteroaryl Stille and Suzuki coupling techniques may<br>
also be used to prepare fused heterocycloalkyl-aryl derivatives.<br><br><br>
Scheme 10 outlines routes for the preparation of Examples 49-51 using standard<br>
methodologies.<br><br>
Scheme 11 outlines the route to prepare carbamate-type derivatives, such as<br>
Examples 52-53, and 404-422. An alternate method to preparing N, N-di-substituted<br>
carbamates utilized a nitrophenyl carbonate intermediate which may be treated with<br>
various primary or secondary amines. Similarly urea, O-carbamate, and N-carbamate<br>
derivatives may be prepared from reaction of the appropriate amine or phenol intermediate<br>
with an isocyanate or chloroformate or from the appropriate nitrophenyl carbonate,<br>
nitrophenyl carbamate, or trichloromethylcarbonyl (see J. Org. Cheni. 2003, 68, 3733-<br>
3735). Ether derivatives, such as Examples 60-67, may be prepared from the phenol<br>
intermediates using standard alkylation techniques known to those skilled in the art of<br>
organic synthesis.<br><br><br>
Scheme 12 shows a process for preparation of heterocycloalkyl lactone derivatives,<br>
such as Examples 68, 70-74. The intermediate keto-ester was reduced to a hydroxyl-ester<br>
intermediate, which cyclizes to the lactone.<br><br><br><br>
Schemes 13-15 outline preparations for cyclic ether derivatives. The cyclic ether<br>
group was installed by formation of a keto-ester intermediate prepared through a standard<br>
Friedel-Crafts type acylation reaction (described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,630,500 and herein).<br>
The alkyl spacer between the chlorocarbonyl and ester may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted. The keto-ester was then reduced to the diol intermediate using LiBHU in<br>
THF or NaBHU in ethanol. The ring may be closed by treatment with an acid such as<br>
trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane or dichloroethane. As shown in Scheme 14, the R2<br>
group could be incorporated after installation of the cyclic ether using a base and an<br>
electrophile, or as shown in Scheme 15, the R2 group may be installed first, followed by<br>
formatioi of the cyclic ether ring.<br><br><br>
Scheme 16 outlines preparation of oxime and hydrazone derivatives (such as<br>
Examples 29, 169, 236-286, and 277-300) from the appropriate aldehyde or ketone using<br>
standard procedures known in the art.<br><br><br>
Scheme 17 shows preparation of arylamine derivatives, such as Examples 287-306.<br>
The aryl amine reagent is coupled with the bromo intermediate followed by lactam<br>
formation using RaNi and hydrogen in DMF/MeOH.<br><br>
Scheme 18 shows a route for the preparation of heteroarylamine derivatives, such<br>
as Examples 309-318. Amino intermediates 1-29 and 1-37 were prepared by alkylation of<br>
the appropriate cyano-esters with the appropriate alkyl iodide or bromide followed by<br>
nitration, and subsequent RaNi reduction to provide the amino-lactam. Reaction of the<br>
amino lactam intermediate with an appropriate heteroaryl bromide or chloride produced<br>
the desired compounds.<br>

and are not intended to be limiting thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
General Procedure for Examples 1-3.<br>
To a suspension of the diol intermediate 1-1 (1 equivalent) in either the appropriate<br>
alcohol, or the appropriate alcohol with either methylene chloride or chloroform, at room<br>
temperature in a reaction tube was slowly added trifluoroacetic anhydride (1-2 equiv).<br>
The tube was flushed with nitrogen and sealed tightly. The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 1-2 hours then heated to 80 °C for 2-60 h and monitored for disappearance<br>
of starting material by HPLC. Upon completion the reaction was allowed to cool to room<br>
temperature, concentrated and worked up by either triturating the residue with ether or<br>
collecting the resulting precipitate by filtration or extraction of the product from the<br>
reaction mixture with a suitable organic solvent. The solid product was purified by<br><br>
triturating with ether or bv flash chromatographv on silica gel using ethvl acetate or a<br>
mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane.<br>

General method for Examples 4-6<br>
To a well-stirred suspension of intermediate diol 1-1 (0.150 g, 0.37 mmol) in 7 mL<br>
of methylene chloride were added sequentially trifluoroacetic anhydride (0.395 g, 1.88<br>
mmol) and N-methyl morpholine (0.152 g, 1.5 mmol) at 5 °C and under argon<br>
atmosphere. The resulted suspension was further stirred at room temperature for 3 h and<br>
the low boiling solvents were removed under vacuum. The solid was suspended in 70 mL<br>
of acetonitrile and the excess amine or amide was added then refluxed for 18 h and<br>
acetonitrile was removed under vacuum. The crude material was dissolved in a mixture of<br>
THF and MeOH (1:1 ratio, 7 mL) and treated with 10 mL of 0.5 M solution of NaOMe in<br>
MeOH. The reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h and the low boiling<br>
solvents were removed under vacuum and the reaction mixture was quenched with water.<br>
The solid was filtered, washed with water and dried to provide the crude solid. The crude<br>
material was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 5% MeOH in methylene<br>
chloride to obtain pure product.<br><br>

Utility<br>
The compounds of the present invention are useful, inter alia, as<br>
therapeutic agents. Particularly, the compounds are useful for kinase inhibition, such as,<br>
for example, trk, VEGFR, PDGFR, PKC, MLK, DLK, Tie-2, FLT-3, and CDK1-6.<br>
Various compounds of the present invention show enhanced pharmaceutical properties<br>
over those disclosed in the art and improved pharmacokinetic properties in mammals. The<br>
compounds of the present invention show enhanced pharmaceutical properties over those<br>
disclosed in the art, including increased MLK and DLK dual inhibition activity, or<br>
increased VEGFR and Tie-2 dual inhibition activity, along with improved<br>
pharmacokinetic properties in mammals. For example, compounds of the present<br>
invention, including those in which at least one of R3, R4, R5, and R6 is NR1 'R32 or<br>
optionally substituted -(alkylene)x-heterocycloalkyl, wherein the heterocycloalkyl does not<br>
include unsubstituted N-morpholinyl, N-piperidyl, or N-thiomorpholinyl, wherein said<br>
alkylene group is optionally substituted with one to three R10 groups, have been shown to<br>
increase MLK and DLK inhibition activity. In another example, compounds of the present<br>
invention, including those in which at least one of RJ, VC, R3, and R° is NR1 'RJJ, show<br>
increased VEGFR and Tie-2 inhibition activity.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
preventing diseases and disorders, such as those disclosed herein, which comprises<br>
administering to a subject in need of such treatment or prevention a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a compound of the present invention.<br>
In an additional embodiment, the present invention provides a method for<br>
inhibiting trk kinase activity comprising providing a compound of the present invention in<br>
an amount sufficient to result in effective inhibition. Particularly, inhibition of trk implies<br>
utility in, for example, diseases of the prostate such as prostate cancer and benign prostate<br>
hyperplasia, as well as for the treatment of inflammation, such as neurological<br>
inflammation and chronic arthritis inflammation. In a preferred embodiment, the trk<br>
kinase receptor is trk A.<br><br>
The majority of cancers have an absolute requirement for angiogenesis, the<br>
process by which new blood vessels are formed. The most potent angiogenic cytokine is<br>
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and there has been substantial research into the<br>
development of VEGF/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) antagonists. Receptor tyrosine kinase<br>
(RTK) inhibitors could have broad spectrum antitumor activity in patients with advanced<br>
pre-treated breast and colorectal carcinoma and Kaposi's sarcoma. Potentially these agents<br>
may play a role in the treatment of both early (adjuvant) and advanced cancer. The<br>
importance of angiogenesis for the progressive growth and viability of solid tumors is well<br>
established. Emerging data suggest an involvement of angiogenesis in the<br>
pathophysiology of hematologic malignancies as well. Recently, authors have reported<br>
increased angiogenesis in the bone marrow of patients with acute myeloid leukemia<br>
(AML) and normalization of bone marrow microvessel density when patients achieved a<br>
complete remission (CR) after induction chemotherapy. Tumor angiogenesis depends on<br>
the expression of specific mediators that initiate a cascade of events leading to the<br>
formation of new microvessels. Among these, VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor),<br>
FGF (fibroblast growth factor) play a pivotal role in the induction of neovascularization in<br>
solid tumors. These cytokines stimulate migration and proliferation of endothelial cells<br>
and induce angiogenesis in vivo. Recent data suggest an important role for these<br>
mediators in hematologic malignancies as well. Isolated AML blasts overexpress VEGF<br>
and VEGF receptor 2. Thus, the VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway can promote the growth of<br>
leukemic blasts in an autocrine and paracrine manner. Therefore, neovascularization and<br>
angiogenic mediators/receptors may be promising targets for anti-angiogenic and anti-<br>
leukemic treatment strategies. Thus, in other embodiments, the present invention provides<br>
a method for treating or preventing angiogenic disorders where VEGFR kinase activity<br>
contributes to pathological conditions, the method comprising providing a compound of<br>
the present invention in an amount sufficient to result in the vascular endothelial growth<br>
factor receptor being contacted with an effective inhibitory amount of the compound.<br>
Inhibition of VEGFR implies utility in, for example, angiogenic disorders such as cancer<br>
of solid tumors, endometriosis, macular degeneration, retinopathy, diabetic retinopathy,<br>
psoriasis, hemangioblastoma, as well as other ocular diseases and cancers.<br><br>
FLT3, a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) class in, is preferentially<br>
expressed on the surface of a high proportion of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and B-<br>
lineage acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) cells in addition to hematopoietic stem cells,<br>
brain, placenta and liver. An interaction of FLT3 and its ligand has been shown to play an<br>
important role in the survival, proliferation and differentiation of not only normal<br>
hematopoetic cells but also leukemia cells. Mutations of the FLT3 gene was first reported<br>
as an interna] tandem duplication (LTD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding<br>
sequence, subsequently as a missense mutation of D835 within a kinase domain. ITD- and<br>
D835-mutations are essentially found in AML and their frequencies are approximately 20<br>
and 6% of adults with AML, respectively. Thus, mutation of the FLT3 gene is so far the<br>
most frequent genetic alteration reported to be involved in AML. Several large-scale<br>
studies in well-documented patients published to date have demonstrated that 1'1'D-<br>
mutation is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. An inhibitor<br>
compound of FLT3 tyrosine kinase have an application in treatment of leukemia. The<br>
present invention provides a method for treating disorders characterized by responsiveness<br>
to FLT3 inhibition, the method comprising providing a compound of the present invention<br>
in an amount sufficient to result in the inhibition of FLT3.<br>
Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) was one of the first polypeptide growth<br>
factors identified that signals through a cell surface tyrosine kinase receptor (PDGF-R) to<br>
stimulate various cellular functions including growth, proliferation, and differentiation.<br>
Since then, several related genes have been identified constituting a family of ligands<br>
(primarily PDGF A and B) and their cognate receptors (PDGF-R alpha and beta). To date,<br>
PDGF expression has been shown in a number of different solid tumors, from<br>
glioblastomas to prostate carcinomas. In these various tumor types, the biologic role of<br>
PDGF signaling can vary from autocrine stimulation of cancer cell growth to more subtle<br>
paracrine interactions involving adjacent stroma and even angiogenesis. Thus, in<br>
additional embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
preventing disorders where PDGFR activity contributes to pathological conditions, the<br>
method comprising providing a compound of the present invention in an amount sufficient<br>
to result in the platelet derived growth factor receptor being contacted with an effective<br>
inhibitory amount of the compound. Inhibition of PDGFR implies utility in, for example,<br><br>
various forms of neoplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic arthritis, pulmonary fibrosis,<br>
myelofibrosis, abnormal wound healing, diseases with cardiovascular end points, such as<br>
atherosclerosis, restenosis, post-angioplasty restenosis, and the like.<br>
In further embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating or<br>
preventing disorders where MLK activity contributes to pathological conditions, such as<br>
those listed above, wherein the method comprises providing a compound of the present<br>
invention in an amount sufficient to result in the MLK receptor being contacted with an<br>
effective inhibitory amount of the compound. Inhibition of MLK implies utility in, for<br>
example, forms of cancer where MLKs play a pathological role as well as in neurological<br>
disorders.<br>
In still other embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating<br>
disorders characterized by the aberrant activity of trophic factor responsive cells, the<br>
method comprising providing a compound of the present invention in an amount sufficient<br>
to result in the trophic factor cell receptor being contacted with an effective activity<br>
inducing amount of the compound. In certain preferred embodiments, the activity of the<br>
trophic factor responsive cells is ChAT activity.<br>
Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) are members of a family of<br>
polypeptides synthesized by a variety of cell types during the processes of embryonic<br>
development and in adult tissues. FGFR have been detected in normal and malignant cells<br>
and are involved in biological events that include mitogenic and angiogenic activity with a<br>
consequent crucial role in cell differentiation and development. To activate signal<br>
transduction pathways, FGFR are coupled to fibroblast growth factors (FGF) and heparan<br>
sulfate (HS) proteoglycans to form a biologically fundamental ternary complex. Based on<br>
these considerations, inhibitors able to block the signaling cascade through a direct<br>
interaction with FGFR could have antiangiogenesis and subsequent antitumor activity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for treating disorders characterized<br>
by the aberrant activity of FGF responsive cells, the method comprising providing a<br>
compound of the present invention in an amount sufficient to result in the FGFR being<br>
contacted with an effective activity inducing amount of the compound.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can also have positive effects on the<br>
function and survival of trophic factor responsive cells by promoting the survival of<br><br>
neurons. With respect to the survival of a cholinergic neuron, for example, the compound<br>
may preserve the survival of a cholinergic neuronal population at risk of dying (due to,<br>
e.g., injury, a disease condition, a degenerative condition or natural progression) when<br>
compared to a cholinergic neuronal population not presented with such compound, if the<br>
treated population has a comparatively greater period of functionality than the non-treated<br>
population.<br>
A variety of neurological disorders are characterized by neuronal cells which are<br>
dying, injured, functionally compromised, undergoing axonal degeneration, at risk of<br>
dying, etc. These neurodegenerative diseases and disorders include, but are not limited to,<br>
Alzheimer's disease; motor neuron disorders (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis);<br>
Parkinson's disease; cerebrovascular disorders (e.g., stroke, ischemia); Huntington's<br>
disease; AIDS dementia; epilepsy; multiple sclerosis; peripheral neuropathies including<br>
diabetic neuropathy and chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy, AID related<br>
peripheral neuropathy; disorders induced by excitatory amino acids; and disorders<br>
associated with concussive or penetrating injuries of the brain or spinal cord.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the compounds of the present invention are useful<br>
for treating or preventing multiple myeloma and leukemias including, but not limited to,<br>
acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphocytic<br>
leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.<br>
In additional embodiments, the present compounds are also useful in the treatment<br>
of disorders associated with decreased ChAT activity or the death, injury to spinal cord<br>
motoneurons, and also have utility in, for example, diseases associated with apoptotic cell<br>
death of the central and peripheral nervous system, immune system and in inflammatory<br>
diseases. ChAT catalyzes the synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and it is<br>
considered an enzymatic marker for a functional cholinergic neuron. A functional neuron<br>
is also capable of survival. Neuron survival is assayed by quantification of the specific<br>
uptake and enzymatic conversion of a dye (e.g., calcein AM) by living neurons. The<br>
compounds described herein may also find utility in the treatment of disease states<br>
involving malignant cell proliferation, such as many cancers.<br>
Additional embodiments of the invention are directed to the use of any compound<br>
described herein, and stereoisomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, in the<br><br>
treatment and/or prevention of any of the conditions, diseases and disorders described<br>

The compounds of the present invention have important functional<br>
pharmacological activities which find utility in a variety of settings, including both<br>
research and therapeutic arenas. For ease of presentation, and in order not to limit the<br>
range of utilities for which these compounds can be characterized, the activities of the<br>
compounds of the present invention can be generally described as follows:<br>
A.	Inhibition of enzymatic activity<br>
B.	Effect on the function and/or survival of trophic factor responsive cells<br>
C.	Inhibition of inflammation-associated responses<br>
D.	Inhibition of cell growth associated with hyperproliferative states<br>
E.	Inhibition of developmentally programmed motoneuron death<br>
Inhibition of enzymatic activity can be determined using, for example, VEGFR<br>
inhibition (e.g., VEGFR2 inhibition), MLK inhibition (e.g., MLK1, MLK2 or MLK3<br>
inhibition), PDGFR kinase inhibition, NGF-stimulated trk phosphorylation, PKC<br>
inhibition, or trk tyrosine kinase inhibition assays. Effect on the function and/or survival of<br>
trophic factor responsive cells, e.g., cells of a neuronal lineage, can be established using<br>
any of the following assays: (1) cultured spinal cord choline acetyltransferase ("ChAT")<br>
assay; (2) cultured dorsal root ganglion ("DRG") neurite extension assay; (3) cultured<br>
basal forebrain neuron ("BFN") ChAT activity assay. Inhibition of inflammation-<br>
associated response can be established using an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase ("EDO")<br>
mRNA assay. Inhibition of cell growth associated with hyperproliferative states can be<br><br>
determined by measuring the growth of cell lines of interest, such as an AT2 line in the<br>
case of prostate cancer. Inhibition of developmentally programmed motoneuron death can<br>
be assessed in ovo using embryonic chick somatic motoneurons, which cells undergo<br>
naturally occurring death between embryonic days 6 and 10, and analyzing inhibition of<br>
such naturally occurring cell death as mediated by the compounds disclosed herein.<br>

A description of assays that may be used in connection with the present invention<br>
are set forth below. They are not intended, nor are they to be construed, as limiting the<br>
scope of the disclosure.<br>
Inhibition of trkA Tyrosine Kinase Activity<br>
Selected compounds of the present invention were tested for their ability to inhibit<br>
the kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed human trkA cytoplasmic domain using an<br>
ELISA-based assay as previously described (Angeles et al., Anal. Biochem. 236: 49-55,<br>
1996). Briefly, the 96-well microtiter plate was coated with substrate solution<br>
(recombinant human phospholipase C- yl/glutathione S-transferase fusion protein (Rotin<br>
et al., EMBO J., 11: 559-567, 1992). Inhibition studies were performed in 100 \i\ assay<br>
mixtures containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,40u,M ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.1% BSA, 2%<br>
DMSO, and various concentrations of inhibitor. The reaction was initiated by addition of<br>
trkA kinase and allowed to proceed for 15 minutes at 37°C. An antibody to<br><br>
phosphotyrosine (UBI) was then added, followed by a secondary enzyme-conjugated<br>
antibody, alkaline phosphatase-labelled goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad). The activity of<br>
the bound enzyme was measured via an amplified detection system (Gibco-BRL).<br>
Inhibition data were analyzed using the sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation<br>
in GraphPad Prism. The concentration that resulted in 50% inhibition of kinase activity is<br>
referred to as "IC50".<br>
Inhibition of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor Kinase Activity<br>
Selected compounds of the present invention were examined for their inhibitory<br>
effects on the kinase activity of baculovirus-expressed VEGF receptor (human flk-1,<br>
KDR, VEGFR2) kinase domain using the procedure described for the trkA kinase ELISA<br>
assay described above. The kinase reaction mixture, consisting of 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4,<br>
40 |iM ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.1% BSA, 2% DMSO, and various concentrations of<br>
inhibitor, was transferred to PLC-y/GST-coated plates. VEGFR kinase was added and the<br>
reaction was allowed to proceed for 15 min. at 37 °C. Detection of phosphorylated<br>
product was accomplished by addition of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (UBI). A<br>
secondary enzyme-conjugated antibody was delivered to capture the antibody-<br>
phosphorylated PLC-y/GST complex. The activity of the bound enzyme was measured via<br>
an amplified detection system (Gibco-BRL). Inhibition data were analyzed using the<br>
sigmoidal dose-response (variable slope) equation in GraphPad Prism.<br>
Inhibition of Mixed Lineage Kinase-1 Activity<br>
The kinase activity of MLK1 was assessed using the Millipore Multiscreen TCA<br>
"in-plate" format as described for protein kinase C (Pitt &amp; Lee, J. Biomol. Screening, !_:<br>
47-51, 1996). Briefly, each 50-u,l assay mixture contained 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.0, 1 mM<br>
EGTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 25 mM p-glycerophosphate, 60 uM ATP, 0.25 u.Ci [y-<br>
32P]ATP, 0.1% BSA, 500 ng/ml myelin basic protein (UBI #13-104), 2% DMSO, 1 uM of<br>
test compound, and 1 ng/ml of baculoviral GST-MLKIKD- Samples were incubated for 15<br>
min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by adding ice cold 50% TCA and the proteins<br>
were allowed to precipitate for 30 min at 4°C. The plates were then washed with ice cold<br><br>
25% TCA. Supermix scintillation cocktail was added, and the plates were allowed to<br>
equilibrate for 1-2 hours prior to counting using the Wallace MicroBeta 1450 PLUS<br>
scintillation counter.<br>
Dual Leucine Zipper Bearing Kinase Assay<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity of<br>
recombinant baculoviral human DLK, containing the kinase domain and leucine zipper.<br>
Activity was measured in 384-well FluoroNunc plates (Cat#460372) using a time-resolved<br>
fluorescence readout (PerkinElmer Application Note 1234-968). Plates were coated with<br>
30 u.1 of the protein substrate MKK7 (Merritt et al. 1999) at a concentration of 20 u.g/ml in<br>
Tris buffered saline (TBS). Each 30 u.1 assay contained 20 mM MOPS (pH 7.2), 15 mM<br>
MgCl2, 0.1 mM Na3V04, 1 mM DTT, 5 mM EGTA, 25 mM P-glycerophosphate, 0.1%<br>
BSA, 100 uM ATP, and 2.5% DMSO. Reactions were started by the addition of 10 ng/ml<br>
GST-hDLKjcD/LZ- For IC50 determinations, a 10-point dose response curve was generated<br>
for each compound. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes, and the reactions<br>
stopped by the addition of 100 mM EDTA. Product was detected using Europium-labeled<br>
anti-phosphothreonine (Wallac#AD0093; diluted 1:10000 in 3%BSA/T-TBS). Following<br>
overnight capture at 4°C, 50 u.1 enhancement solution (Wallac #1244-105) was added and<br>
the plate gently agitated for 5 min. The fluorescence of the resulting solution was then<br>
measured using the time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) mode in the Multilabel Reader<br>
(Victor2 Model # 1420-018 or Envision Model # 2100). Inhibition data was analyzed<br>
using GraphPad PRISM. See also Merritt, S.E., Mata, M., Nihalani, D., Zhu, C., Hu, X.,<br>
and Holzman, L.B. (1999) The Mixed Lineage Kinase DLK utilizes MKK7 and not<br>
MKK4 as Substrate. J. Biol. Chem. 274, 10195-10202.<br>
Tie-2 Tyrosine Kinase Assay<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the kinase activity of<br>
recombinant baculoviral human His6-Tie2 cytoplasmic domain using a modification of the<br>
ELISA described for trkA (Angeles et al., 1996). A 384-well plate format was used for<br>
single-point screening while IC50S were performed on 96-well plates. For single-point<br>
screening, each barcoded 384-well Costar High Binding plate (Cat # 3703) was coated<br><br>
with 50 ^I/well of 10 u.g/ml substrate solution (recombinant human GST- PLC-y; Rotin et<br>
al., 1992) in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). The Tie2 activity was measured in 50-ul assay<br>
mixtures containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 40 \iM ATP, 10 mM MnCl2, 2.5% DMSO,<br>
0.05% BSA, and 200 ng/ml His6-Tie2CD- For IC50 determinations, the assays were run as<br>
described above but in 96-well Costar High Binding plates (Cat # 3703) and with the<br>
volumes doubled. A 10-point dose response curve was generated for each compound. The<br>
kinase reaction was allowed to proceed at 37°C for 20 minutes. The detection antibody,<br>
Nl-Eu anti-phosphotyrosine (PT66) antibody (Wallac #AD0041), was added at 1:2000<br>
diluted in block buffer [3% BSA in TBS with 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST)]. After one-hour<br>
incubation at 37°C, 50 ^il of enhancement solution (Wallac #1244-105) was added and the<br>
plate was gently agitated. The fluorescence of the resulting solution was then measured<br>
using the time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) mode in the Multilabel Reader (Victor2 Model<br>
# 1420-018 or Envision Model # 2100). Inhibition data were analyzed using ActivityBase<br>
and IC50 curves were generated using XLFit. The cited references are as follows:<br>
