TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to compounds useful as inhibitors of protein kinases.<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutically acceptable compositions comprising the<br>
compounds of the invention and methods of using the compositions in the treatment of<br>
various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by a<br>
better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with<br>
diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is<br>
protein kinases.<br>
[0003] Protein kinases constitute a large family of structurally related enzymes that are<br>
responsible for the control of a variety of signal transduction processes within the cell. (See,<br>
Hardie, G. and Hanks, S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book, I and II, Academic Press, San<br>
Diego, CA: 1995). Protein kinases are thought to have evolved from a common ancestral<br>
gene due to the conservation of their structure and catalytic function. Almost all kinases<br>
contain a similar 250-300 amino add catalytic domain. The kinases may be categorized into<br>
families by the substrates they pbosphorylate (e.g., protein-tyrosine, protein-serine/threonine,<br>
lipids, etc.). Sequence motifs have been identified that generally correspond to each of these<br>
kinase families (See, for example, Hanks, S.K., Hunter, T, FASEB J. 1995, 9, 576-596;<br>
Knighton et ai, Science 1991, 253, 407-414; Hiles et al, Cell 1992, 70, 419-429; Kunz et al,<br>
Cell 1993, 73, 585-596; Garcia-Bustos et ai, EMBOJ. 1994,13, 2352-2361).<br>
[0004] In general, protein kinases mediate intracellular signaling by effecting a<br>
phosphoryi transfer from a nucleoside triphosphate to a protein acceptor that is involved in a<br>
signaling pathway. These phosphorylation events act as molecular on/off switches that can<br>
modulate or regulate the target protein biological function. These phosphorylation events are<br><br>
ultimately triggered in response to a variety of extracellular and other stimuli. Examples of<br>
such stimuli include environmental and chemical stress signals (e.g., osmotic shock, heat<br>
shock, ultraviolet radiation, bacterial endotoxin, and H2O2), cytokines (e.g., .interleukin-1<br>
(H-l) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a)), and growth factors (e.g., granulocyte<br>
macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)). An<br>
extracellular stimulus may affect one or more cellular responses related to cell growth,<br>
migration, differentiation, secretion of hormones, activation of transcription factors, muscle<br>
contraction, glucose metabolism, control of protein synthesis, and regulation of the cell cycle.<br>
[0005] Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by<br>
protein kinase-mediated events as described above. These diseases include, but are not<br>
limited to, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, bone diseases, metabolic diseases,<br>
neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and<br>
asthma, Alzheimer's disease, and hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, -there has been a<br>
substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as<br>
therapeutic agents.<br>
[0006] The Tec family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases plays a central role in signalling<br>
through antigen-receptors such as the TCR, BCR and Fee receptors (reviewed in Miller A, et<br>
al. Current Opinion in Immunology 14;331-340 (2002). Tec family kinases are essential for<br>
T cell activation. Three members of the Tec family, Itk, Rlk and Tec, are activated<br>
downstream of antigen receptor engagement in T cells and transmit signals to downstream<br>
effectors, including PLC-y. Deletion of Itk in mice results in reduced T cell receptor (TCR)-<br>
induced proliferation and secretion of the cytokines EL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10 and IFN-y<br>
(Schaeffer et al, Science 284; 638-641 (1999)), Fowell et al, Immunity ll;399-409 (1999),<br>
Schaeffer et al Nature Immunology 2,12; 1183-1188 (2001))). The immunological<br>
symptoms of allergic asthma are attenuated in Itk-/- mice. Lung inflammation, eosinophil<br>
infiltration and mucous production are drastically reduced in Itk-/- mice in response to<br>
challenge with the allergen OVA (Mueller et al, Journal of Immunology 170: 5056-5063<br>
(2003)). Itk has also been implicated in atopic dermatitis. This gene has been reported to be<br>
more highly expressed in peripheral blood T cells from patients with moderate and/or severe<br>
atopic dermatitis than in controls or patients with mild atopic dermatitis (Matsumoto et al,<br>
International archives of Allergy and Immunology 129; 327-340 (2002)).<br>
[0007] • Splenocytes from Rlk-/- mice secrete half the IL-2 produced by wild type animals<br>
in response to TCR engagement (Schaeffer et al, Science 284; 638-641 (1999)), while<br><br>
combined deletion of Itk and Rlk in mice leads to a profound inhibition of TCR-induced<br>
responses including proliferation and production of the cytokines IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IFN-y<br>
(Schaeffer et al Nature Immunology 2,12; 1183-1188 (2001)), Schaeffer et al, Science 284;<br>
638-641 (1999)). Intracellular signalling following TCR engagement is effected in Itk/Rlk<br>
deficient T cells; inositol triphosphate production, calcium mobilization, MAP kinase<br>
activation, and activation of the transcription factors NFAT and AP-1 are all reduced<br>
(Schaeffer et al, Science 284; 638-641 (1999), Schaeffer et al Nature Immunology 2,12;<br>
1183-1188(2001)).<br>
[0008] Tec family kinases are also essential for B cell development and activation.<br>
Patients with mutations in Btk have a profound block in B cell development, resulting in the<br>
almost complete absence of B lymphocytes and plasma cells, severely reduced Ig levels and a<br>
profound inhibition of humoral response to recall antigens (reviewed in Vihinen et al<br>
Frontiers in Bioscience 5:d917-928). Mice deficient in Btk also have a reduced number of<br>
peripheral B cells and greatly decreased levels of IgM and IgG3. Btk deletion in mice has a<br>
profound effect on B cell proliferation induced by anti-IgM, and inhibits immune responses<br>
to thymus-independent type II antigens (Ellmeier et al, J Exp Med 192:1611-1623 (2000)).<br>
[0009] Tec kinases also play a role in mast cell activation through the high-affinity IgE<br>
receptor (FceRJ). Itk and Btk are expressed in mast cells and are activated by FceRI cross-<br>
linking (Kawakami et al, Journal of Immunology; 3556-3562 (1995)). Btk deficient murine<br>
mast cells have reduced degranulation and decreased production of proinfllammatory<br>
cytokines following FceRI cross-linking (Kawakami et al. Journal of leukocyte biology<br>
65:286-290). Btk deficiency also results in a decrease of macrophage effector functions<br>
(Mukhopadhyay et al, Journal of Immunology; 168,2914-2921 (2002)).<br>
[0010] Accordingly, there is a great need to develop compounds useful as inhibitors of<br>
protein kinases. In particular, it would be desirable to develop compounds that are useful as<br>
inhibitors of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) protein kinases,<br>
particularly given the inadequate treatments currently available for the majority of the<br>
disorders implicated in their activation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0011] It has now been found that compounds of this invention, and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions thereof, are effective as inhibitors of protein kinases. In certain<br><br>
embodiments, these compounds are effective as inhibitors Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk,<br>
Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) protein kinases. These compounds have the general formula I:<br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, G, Cy1, and X<br>
are as defined below.<br>
[0012] These compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions thereof are<br>
useful for treating or preventing a variety of diseases, disorders or conditions, including, but<br>
not limited to, an autoimmune, inflammatory, proliferative, or hyperproliferative disease or<br>
an immunologically-mediated disease. The compositions are also useful in methods for<br>
preventing thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.<br>
[0013] The compounds provided by this invention are also useful for the study of kinases<br>
in biological and pathological phenomena; the study of intracellular signal transduction<br>
pathways mediated by such kinases; and the comparative evaluation of new kinase inhibitors.<br>

[0032] As detailed above, in some embodiments, two independent occurrences of R° (or<br>
R+, or any other variable similarly defined herein), are taken together together with the<br>
atom(s) to which each variable is bound to form a 5-8-membered heterocyclyl, aryl, or<br>
heteroaryl ring or a 3-8-membered cycloalkyl ring having 0-3 heteroatoms independently<br>
selected from nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur. Exemplary rings that are formed when two<br>
independent occurrences of R° (or R+, or any other variable similarly defined herein) are<br>
taken together with the atom(s) to which each variable is bound include, but are not limited to<br>
the following: a) two independent occurrences of R° (or R+, or any other variable similarly<br>
defined herein) that are bound to the same atom and are taken together with that atom to form<br>
a ring, for example, N(R°)2, where both occurrences of R° are taken together with the<br>
nitrogen atom to form a piperidin-1-yl, piperazin-1-yl, or morpholin-4-yl group; and b) two<br>
independent occurrences of R° (or R+, or any other variable similarly defined herein) that are<br>
bound to different atoms and are taken together with both of those atoms to form a ring, for<br>
example where a phenyl group is substituted with two occurrences of OR0 <br>
these two occurrences of R° are taken together with the oxygen atoms to which they are<br>
bound to form a fused 6-membered oxygen containing ring:  It will be<br><br>
appreciated that a variety of other rings can be formed when two independent occurrences of<br>
R° (or R+, or any other variable similarly defined herein) are taken together with the atorn(s)<br>
to which each variable is bound and that the examples detailed above are not intended to be<br>
limiting.<br>
[0033] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to include all<br>
isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational)) forms of the<br>
structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, (Z) and (E)<br>
double bond isomers, and (Z) and (E) conformational isomers. Therefore, single<br>
stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or<br>
conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within<br>
the scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein<br>
are also meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more<br>
isotopically enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except<br>
for the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a<br>
13C- or 14C-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are<br>
useful, for example, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays.<br>

[0111] 5. Uses, Formulation and Administration<br>
[0112] Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
[0113] As discussed above, the present invention provides compounds that are inhibitors<br>
of protein kinases, and thus the present compounds are useful for the treatment of diseases,<br>
disorders, and conditions including, but not limited to an autoimmune, inflammatory,<br>
proliferative, or hyperproliferative disease or an immunologically-mediated disease.<br>
Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
compositions are provided, wherein these compositions comprise any of the compounds as<br>
described herein, and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant or<br>
vehicle. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally further comprise one or more<br>
additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[0114] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can<br>
exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of<br>
such esters, or any other adduct or derivative which upon administration to a patient in need<br>
is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as otherwise described herein, or a<br>
metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts which are,<br>
within the scope of sound medical judgement, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of<br>
humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like,<br>
and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. A "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt" means any non-toxic salt or salt of an ester of a compound of this invention that, upon<br>
administration to a recipient, is capable of providing, either directly or indirectly, a compound<br>
of this invention or an inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof. As used herein, the<br>
term "inhibitorily active metabolite or residue thereof means that a metabolite or residue<br>
thereof is also an inhibitor of a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)<br>
protein kinases kinase.<br>
[0115] Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well known in the art. For example, S. M.<br>
Berge et at, describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical<br>
Sciences, 1977, 66,1-19, incorporated herein by reference. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
of the compounds of this invention include those derived from suitable inorganic and organic<br>
acids and bases. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are<br>
salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic<br>
acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by<br>
using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate,<br>

persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate,<br>
sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.<br>
Salts derived from appropriate bases include alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium<br>
and N*(Ci.talkyl)4 salts. This invention also envisions the quaternization of any basic<br>
nitrogen-containing groups of the compounds disclosed herein. Water or oil-soluble or<br>
dispensable products may be obtained by such quaternization. Representative alkali or<br>
alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and the<br>
like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when appropriate, nontoxic<br>
ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using counterfoils such as<br>
halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl<br>
sulfonate.<br>
[0116] As described above, the pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of the present<br>
invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, adjuvant, or vehicle,<br>
which, as used herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle,<br>
dispersion or suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or<br>
emulsifying agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the<br>
particular dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E.<br>
W. Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in<br>
formulating pharmaceutically acceptable compositions and known techniques for the<br>
preparation thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with<br>
the compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or<br>
otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other components) of the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of<br>
this invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers include, but are not limited to, ion exchangers, alumina, aluminum stearate, lecithin,<br>
serum proteins, such as human serum albumin, buffer substances such as phosphates, glycine,<br>
sorbic acid, or potassium sorbate, partial glyceride mixtures of saturated vegetable fatty acids,<br>
water, salts or electrolytes, such as protamine sulfate, disodium hydrogen phosphate,<br>
potassium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, zinc salts, colloidal silica, magnesium<br>
trisilicate, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylates, waxes, polyethylene-polyoxypropylene-<br><br>
block polymers, wool fat, sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn<br>
starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc;<br>
excipicnts such as cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil;<br>

such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water;<br>
isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as<br>
other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate,<br>
as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and<br>
perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition,<br>
according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[0117] Uses of Compounds and Pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
[0118]	In yet another aspect, a method for the treatment or lessening the severity of a<br>
Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated diseases is provided<br>
comprising administering an effective amount of a compound, or a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable composition comprising a compound to a subject in need thereof. In certain<br>
embodiments of the present invention an "effective amount" of the compound or<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable composition is that amount effective for a Tec family (e.g.,Tec,<br>
Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease. The compounds and compositions,<br>
according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and<br>
any route of administration effective for treating or lessening the severity of a Tec family<br>
(e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease. The exact amount required<br>
will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general condition of the<br>
subject, the severity of the infection, the particular agent, its mode of administration, and the<br>
like. The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease<br>
of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein<br>
refers to a physically discrete unit of agent appropriate for the patient to be treated. It will be<br>
understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the<br>
present invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any particular patient or organism<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of<br><br>
the disorder, the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition<br>
employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound<br>
employed; the duration of the treatment; drags used in combination or coincidental with the<br>
specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The term<br>
"patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a<br>
human.<br>
[0119] The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be<br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally,<br>
intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an<br>
oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In<br>
certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or<br>
parenterally at dosage levels of about 0.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from<br>
about 1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to<br>
obtain the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[0120] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert<br>
diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing<br>
agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,<br>
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide,<br>
oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils),<br>
glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants<br>
such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and<br>
perfuming agents.<br>
[0121] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile<br>
injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium<br>
chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or<br><br>
suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including ^<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
[0122] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br>
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable<br>
medium prior to use.<br>
[0123] In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is often<br>
desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular<br>
injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or<br>
amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then<br>
depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline<br>
form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot<br>
forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the compound in biodegradable<br>
polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon me ratio of compound to<br>
polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can<br>
be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the<br>
compound in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0124] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which<br>
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the<br>
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[0125] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at<br>
least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose,<br>
mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulose, alginates,<br>
gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d)<br>
disintegrating agents such as agar—agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic<br>
acid, certain silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f)<br><br>
absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as,<br>
for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and<br>
bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid<br>
polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[0126] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and<br>
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,<br>
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may<br>
optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the<br>
active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally,<br>
in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include<br>
polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed<br>
as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar<br>
as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0127] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more<br>
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as is normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting<br>
aids such a magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets<br>
and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally contain<br>
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s)<br>
only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances and<br>
waxes.<br>
[0128] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of this<br>
invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays,<br>
inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile conditions with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be<br><br>
required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being<br>
within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of<br>
transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a<br>
compound to the body. Such dosage forms can be made by dissolving or dispensing the<br>
compound in the proper medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux<br>
of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate<br>
controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0129] As described generally above, the compounds of the invention are useful as<br>
inhibitors of protein kinases. In one embodiment, the compounds and compositions of the<br>
invention are inhibitors of one or more of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx,<br>
Txk/Rlk) kinase, and thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular theory, the<br>
compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the severity of a<br>
disease, condition, or disorder where activation of one or more of a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk,<br>
Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder.<br>
When activation of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) is implicated in a<br>
particular disease, condition, or disorder, the disease, condition, or disorder may also be<br>
referred to as a "Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)-mediated disease" or<br>
disease symptom. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method<br>
for treating or lessening the severity of a disease, condition, or disorder where activation or<br>
one or more of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) is implicated in the<br>
disease state.<br>
[0130] The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as an inhibitor of a Tec<br>
family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or<br>
in a cell line. In vitro assays include assays that determine inhibition of either the<br>
phosphorylation activity or ATPase activity of activated Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk,<br>
Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase. Alternate in vitro assays quantitate the ability of the<br>
inhibitor to bind to a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase.<br>
Inhibitor binding may be measured by radiolabelling the inhibitor prior to binding, isolating<br>
the inhibitor/Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk), complex and<br>
determining the amount of radiolabel bound. Alternatively, inhibitor binding may be<br>
determined by running a competition experiment where new inhibitors are incubated with a<br>
Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase bound to known radioligands.<br><br>
[0131] The term "measurably inhibit", as used herein means a measurable change in a<br>
Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase activity between a sample<br>
comprising said composition and a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk)<br>
kinase and an equivalent sample comprising a Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx,<br>
Txk/Rlk) kinase in the absence of said composition.<br>
[0132] The term "Tec family tyrosine kinases-mediated condition", as used herein means<br>
any disease or other deleterious condition in which Tec family kinases are known to play a<br>
role. Such conditions include, without limitation, autoimmune, inflammatory, proliferative,<br>
and hyperproliferative diseases and immunologically-mediated diseases including rejection of<br>
transplanted organs or tissues and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).<br>
[0133] For example, Tec family tyrosine kinases -mediated conditions include diseases of<br>
the respiratory tract including, without limitation, reversible obstructive airways diseases<br>
including asthma, such as bronchial, allergic, intrinsic, extrinsic and dust asthma, particularly<br>
chronic or inveterate asthma (e.g. late asthma airways hyper-responsiveness) and bronchitis.<br>
Additionally, Tec family tyrosine kinases diseases include, without limitation, those<br>
conditions characterised by inflammation of the nasal mucus membrane, including acute<br>
rhinitis, allergic, atrophic thinitis and chronic rhinitis including rhinitis caseosa, hypertrophic<br>
rhinitis, rhinitis purulenta, rhinitis sicca and rhinitis medicamentosa; membranous rhinitis<br>
including croupous, fibrinous and pseudomembranous rhinitis and scrofoulous rhinitis,<br>
seasonal rhinitis including rhinitis nervosa (hay fever) and vasomotor rhinitis, sarcoidosis,<br>
farmer's lung and related diseases, fibroid lung and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.<br>
[0134] Tec family tyrosine kinases -mediated conditions also include diseases of the bone<br>
and joints including, without limitation, (pannus formation in) rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
seronegative spondyloarthropathis (including ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and<br>
Reiter's disease), Behcet's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, and systemic sclerosis.<br>
[0135]	Tec family kinases-mediated conditions also include diseases and disorders of<br>
the skin, including, without limitation, psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, atopical dermatitis,<br>
contact dermatitis and other eczematous dermatitis, seborrhoetic dermatitis, Lichen planus,<br>
Pemphigus, bullous Pemphigus, epidermolysis bullosa, urticaria, angiodermas, vasculitides,<br>
erythemas, cutaneous eosinophilias, uveitis, Alopecia, areata and vernal conjunctivitis.<br>
[0136] Tec family tyrosine kinases-mediated conditions also include diseases and<br>
disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, including, without limitation, Coeliac disease, proctitis,<br>
eosinophilic gastro-enteritis, mastocytosis, pancreatitis, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis,<br><br>
food-related allergies which have effects remote from the gut, e.g. migraine, rhinitis and<br>
eczema.<br>
[0137] Tec family tyrosine kinases-mediated conditions also include those diseases and<br>
disorders of other tissues and systemic disease, including, without limiation, multiple<br>
sclerosis, artherosclerosis, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), lupus<br>
erythematosus, systemic lupus, erythematosus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, myasthenia gravis,<br>
type I diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, eosinophilia fascitis, hyper IgE syndrome, lepromatous<br>
leprosy, sezary syndrome and idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura, restenosis following<br>
angioplasty, tumours (for example leukemia, lymphomas), artherosclerosis, and systemic<br>
lupus erythematosus.<br>
[0138] Tec family tyrosine kinases-mediated conditions also include allograft rejection<br>
including, without limitation, acute and chronic allograft rejection following for example<br>
transplantation of kidney, heart, liver, lung, bone marrow, skin and cornea; and chronic graft<br>
versus host disease.<br>
[0139] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies, that is, the<br>
compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered concurrently<br>
with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures.<br>
The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a<br>
combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or<br>
procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that<br>
the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an<br>
inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the<br>
same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As<br>
used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a<br>

[0142] The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of this<br>
invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a<br>
composition comprising that therapeutic agent as the only active agent. Preferably the<br>
amount of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range<br>
from about 50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition comprising that<br>
agent as the only therapeutically active agent.<br>
[0143] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices,<br>
such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device<br>
comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes<br>
and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still<br>
another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a<br>
composition comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above,<br>
and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable<br>
device.<br>
[0144] Vascular stents, for example, have been used to overcome restenosis (re-<br>
narrowing of the vessel wall after injury). However, patients using stents or other<br>
implantable devices risk clot formation or platelet activation. These unwanted effects may be<br>
prevented or mitigated by pre-coating the device with a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
composition comprising a kinase inhibitor. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of<br>
coated implantable devices are described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121.<br>
The coatings are typically biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer,<br>
polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl<br>
acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable<br>
topcoat of fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations<br>
thereof to impart controlled release characteristics in the composition.<br>
[0145] Another aspect of the invention relates to inhibiting Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk,<br>
Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) activity in a biological sample or a patient, which method<br>
comprises administering to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound<br>
of formula I or a composition comprising said compound. The term "biological sample", as<br>
used herein, includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material<br><br>
obtained from a mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or<br>
other body fluids or extracts thereof.<br>
[0146] Inhibition of Tec family (e.g.,Tec, Btk, Itk/Emt/Tsk, Bmx, Txk/Rlk) kinase<br>
activity in a biological sample is useful for a variety of purposes that are known to one of<br>
skill in the art. Examples of such purposes include, but are not limited to, blood transfusion,<br>
organ-transplantation, biological specimen storage, and biological assays.<br>

all of the reagents listed above, with the exception of ATP and the test compound of interest.<br>
50 uL of the stock solution was placed in a 96 well plate followed by addition of 1.5uL of<br>
DMSO stock containing serial dilutions of the test compound (typically starting from a final<br>
concentration of 15uM with 2-fold serial dilutions) in duplicate (final DMSO concentration<br>
1.5%). The plate was pre-incubated for 10 minutes at 25°C and the reaction initiated by<br>
addition of 50uL [y-33P]ATP (final concentration 15uM).<br>
[0060] The reaction was stopped after 10 minutes by the addition of 50uL of a TCA /<br>

concentrations in the assay were lOOuM ATP (Sigma Chemicals) and 2\iM peptide<br>
(Biotinylated SAM68 A332-443). Assays were carried out at 25°C and in the presence of Itk<br>
(30nM). An assay stock buffer solution was prepared containing all of the reagents listed<br>
above, with the exception of ATP and the test compound of interest. 25 u-L of the stock<br>
solution was placed in each well of a 96 well plate followed by luL of DMSO containing<br>
serial dilutions of the test compound (typically starting from a final concentration of 15|*M)<br>
in duplicate (final DMSO concentration 2%). The plate was preincubated for 10 minutes at<br>
25°C and the reaction initiated by addition of 25uL ATP (final concentration lOOuM).<br>
Background counts were determined by the addition of 5uL 500mM EDTA to control wells<br>
containing assay stock buffer and DMSO prior to initiation with ATP.<br>
[0200] The reaction was stopped after 30 minutes by diluting the reaction 225-fold into<br>
MOPS buffer (20mM MOPS (pH 7.0), ImM DTT, lOmM MgCl2, 0.1% BSA) containing<br>
50mM EDTA to bring the final concentration of Biotin-SAM68 to 9nM.<br>
[0201] AlphaScreen™ reagents were prepared according to the manufacturers<br>
instructions (AlphaScreen™ phosphotyrosine (P-Tyr-100) assay kit, PerkinElmer catalogue<br>
number 6760620C). Under subdued lighting, 20uL of AlphaScreen™ reagents were placed<br>
in each well of a white half area 96 well plate (Corning Inc. - COSTAR 3693) with 30\iL of<br>
the stopped, diluted kinase reactions. Plates were incubated in the dark for 60 minutes prior<br>
to reading on a Fusion Alpha plate reader (PerkinElmer).<br>
