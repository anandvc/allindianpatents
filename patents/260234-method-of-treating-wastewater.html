DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF TREATING WASTEWATER<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method of treating organic<br>
wastewater by the membrane separation activated sludge process.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] The membrane separation activated sludge process is a method<br>
of treating wastewater, which process is conducted by immersing a<br>
membrane cartridge in an activated sludge tank, thus performing<br>
filtration to execute solid-liquid separation to obtain the activated sludge<br>
and the treated liquor. The process can conduct solid-liquid separation<br>
after increasing the activated sludge concentration (mixed liquor<br>
suspended solid, hereinafter referred to as MLSS) to an extremely high<br>
level of 5000 to 20000 mg/1. With that high MLSS level, the process<br>
has an advantage of decreasing the capacity of the activated sludge tank<br>
or of shortening the reaction time in the activated sludge tank.<br>
Furthermore, since the filtration is conducted by membrane, no<br>
suspended solid (hereinafter also referred to as SS) enters the treated<br>
liquor. Being free from SS eliminates the final sedimentation tank and<br>
can decrease the installation area of the treatment facilities. In addition,<br>
since the filtration can be performed independent of the<br>
easiness/difficulty of sedimentation of the activated sludge, the control<br>
work of the activated sludge can be also decreased. Owing to these<br>
advantages, the membrane separation activated sludge process has<br>
shown rapid propagations in recent years.<br>
[0003] The membrane cartridge adopts flat membrane or hollow fiber<br><br>
membrane. In particular, since the hollow fiber membrane has high<br>
strength of the membrane itself, the membrane surface suffers small<br>
damages caused by the contact with foreign substances entering from<br>
the organic wastewater, and endures long period of use. Furthermore,<br>
the hollow fiber membrane has also an advantage of allowing<br>
backwashing by ejecting a medium such as filtrate to inverse direction<br>
to the filtration direction, thus removing the substances adhered to the<br>
membrane surface. However, the activated sludge or the biopolymers<br>
formed by the metabolism of microorganisms in the activated sludge<br>
adhere to the membrane surface to decrease the effective membrane<br>
surface area, thus decreasing the filtration efficiency. As a result, the<br>
hollow fiber membrane is required to receive frequent backwashing,<br>
which raises a problem of failing to attain stable filtration over a long<br>
period.<br>
[0004] To those problems, for example Japanese Patent Laid-Open No.<br>
2000-157846 (Patent Document 1) discloses a method of aeration using<br>
air and the like from beneath the hollow fiber membrane cartridge.<br>
According to the method, the membrane vibration effect and the<br>
agitation effect of ascending bubbles separate the coagulated activated<br>
sludge adhered to surface of and gap between the membranes and<br>
separate the foreign substances carried by the raw water, and prevent the<br>
accumulation of them. Specifically, for example, a lower ring is<br>
located beneath the hollow fiber membrane cartridge, and a plurality of<br>
throughholes is provided at the attached fixed layer on the lower ring<br>
side, thus creating an air pocket within the lower ring utilizing the<br>
aeration from below the cartridge, thereby generating bubbles uniformly<br><br>
from the plurality of throughholes.<br>
[0005] However, if the variations of concentration of organic substances<br>
in the organic wastewater are significant, or if an oxidant, an acidic<br>
liquor, a basic liquor and the like enter the activated sludge tank,<br>
microorganisms discharge abnormally large quantities of metabolic<br>
products (referred to as the biopolymers) therefrom, in some cases.<br>
When the state of abnormally high concentration of the biopolymers is<br>
sustained, the aeration fails to fully separate the biopolymers adhered to<br>
the outer surface of membrane, resulting in the increased membrane<br>
filtration resistance.<br>
[0006] Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-40747 (Patent Document<br>
2) discloses a method of preventing the adhesion of excess quantity of<br>
polymers to the membrane surface by measuring the quantity of<br>
biopolymers in the biological treatment tank (aeration tank), and by<br>
decreasing the quantity of biopolymers in the biological treatment tank<br>
at an adequate timing. According to the method, the chemical oxygen<br>
demand (COD) value is determined as the substitution of the quantity of<br>
biopolymers. The COD value, however, includes- the quantity of<br>
organic substances which can pass through the micropores of the<br>
membrane. Therefore, there is a possibility that the risk of decreasing<br>
the membrane area caused by adhesion of the biopolymers to the<br>
membrane is evaluated excessively higher than as is, which adds the<br>
work of unnecessarily decreasing the quantity of biopolymers to<br>
deteriorate the work efficiency of wastewater treatment.<br>
[0007] Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-1333 (Patent Document 3)<br>
discloses a method to decrease the quantity of filtration-inhibiting<br><br>
components composed of polymer organic compounds existing in the<br>
biological treatment tank. According to the method, the filtration-<br>
inhibition components are separated by a filter medium after adding a<br>
coagulant, or they are centrifugally separated after adding a coagulant,<br>
thus discarding them. The method is therefore a highly troublesome<br>
one.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0008] An object of the present invention is to provide a method of<br>
efficiently treating wastewater, which method adequately evaluates the<br>
risk of decreasing the membrane area caused by the adhesion of<br>
biopolymers to the membrane, thus preventing the increase in the<br>
membrane filtration resistance.<br>
Means to Solve the Problems<br>
[0009] The inventors of the present invention conducted detail studies,<br>
and found that the substances which adhere to the outer surface of<br>
membrane to inhibit the filtration are sugar, specifically biopolymers<br>
composed mainly of uronic acid, having several hundreds of thousands<br>
to several millions of molecular weight, and further found that the<br>
increase/decrease in the quantity of the organic substances to the<br><br>
quantity of the activated sludge allows controlling also the biopolymers<br>
in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge. That is, the method of<br>
treating wastewater according to the present invention is the following.<br> A method of treating wastewater contains: the flow-in step of<br>
flowing an organic wastewater into an activated sludge tank holding an<br>
activated sludge containing microorganisms therein; and the separation<br>
step of biologically treating the organic wastewater in the activated<br>
sludge tank and then subjecting thus treated liquor to solid-liquid<br>
separation with the use of a separation membrane device located in the<br>
activated sludge tank, wherein the sugar concentration in the aqueous<br>

by solid-liquid separation in the separation membrane device, being<br><br>
discharged from the sludge tank.<br> The method of treating wastewater according to , wherein<br>

Effect of the Invention<br>
[0010] According to the method of treating wastewater of the present<br>
invention, monitoring the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid<br>
concentration in the activated sludge tank allows grasping the quantity<br>
of biopolymers causing the clogging of membrane, and, when the sugar<br>
concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration increase, decreasing<br>
the BOD-SS load allows preventing the clogging of separation<br>
membrane and allows conducting stable solid-liquid separation for a<br>
long period. On the other hand, when the sugar concentration and/or<br>
the uronic acid concentration are excessively lower than those of the<br><br>
respectively specified values, the BOD-SS load can be increased until<br>
the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration increase to<br>
near the respectively specified values. As a result, the work efficiency<br>
of wastewater treatment can be increased.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0013] The method of treating wastewater according to the present<br>
invention is composed of: the flow-in step of flowing an organic<br>
wastewater into an activated sludge tank holding an activated sludge<br>
containing microorganisms therein; and the separation step of<br>
biologically treating the organic wastewater in the activated sludge tank<br>
and then subjecting thus treated liquor to solid-liquid separation with the<br>
use of a separation membrane device located in the activated sludge<br>
tank.<br>
[0014] The flow-in step has a preliminary treatment device which<br>
removes foreign substances from the organic wastewater entering the<br>
activated sludge tank, a flow equalization tank which adjusts the flow<br><br>
rate of organic wastewater entering the activated sludge tank, and the<br>
like. The separation step has the activated sludge tank which treats the<br>
wastewater biologically, a membrane separation device which conducts<br>
solid-liquid separation of the treated liquor, a suction pump which<br>
withdraws the filtrate, and the like.<br>
[0015] The flow-in step supplies the organic wastewater which roughly<br>
removed coarse solid matter and the like to the activated sludge tank<br>
while equalizing the flow rate thereof to a constant level. In the<br>
activated sludge tank, organic substances (BOD components) in the<br>
organic wastewater are decomposed by the microorganisms in the<br>
activated sludge. The size of the activated sludge tank and the<br>
retention time of the organic wastewater in the activated sludge tank are<br>
determined by the discharge rate of the organic wastewater and the<br>
concentration of organic substances in the organic wastewater. The<br>
concentration of activated sludge in the activated sludge tank can be set<br>
to about 5 to about 15 g/L. In the separation step, the separation<br>
membrane device conducts the solid-liquid separation, separating into<br>
the activated sludge and the organic wastewater in the activated sludge<br>
tank. The immersion type separation membrane device positioned in<br>
the activated sludge tank is composed of a separation membrane and a<br>
water-collecting section, and further has a skirt. A blower supplies a<br>
gas to the skirt, thus oscillating the membrane, and further the<br>
membrane surface is hit by a water stream to receive shearing force,<br>
thus preventing clogging of the membrane. The water-collecting<br>
section in the separation membrane device is connected to the suction<br>
pump by a pipe, and the suction pump generates a pressure gradient<br><br>
between the inner face and the outer face of the membrane, thus<br>
achieving the solid-liquid separation.<br>
[0016] The membrane cartridge used for the separation membrane may<br>
use a known separation membrane such as flat membrane and hollow<br>
fiber membrane. Among them, the hollow fiber membrane is<br>
preferred owing to the high strength of the membrane itself, to the<br>
generation of less damages on the surface of membrane caused by the<br>
contact with foreign substances in the organic wastewater, and to the<br>
endurance to long period of use. In addition, the filter membrane can<br>
be backwashed by ejecting filtrate and the like to inverse direction to the<br>
filtration direction, thus removing the substances adhered to the<br>
membrane surface. The separation membrane device may not only be<br>
positioned by immersing thereof in the activated sludge tank but also be<br>
positioned by connecting with the activated sludge tank. The method<br>
of the present invention therefore is applicable not only to the<br>
immersion type membrane separation activated sludge process but also<br>
to the case of mounting the separation membrane device in a tank<br>
different from the activated sludge tank, and further to the case of<br>
pressure-type separation membrane device. For these cases, the<br>
activated sludge is recycled between the activated sludge tank and the<br>
separation membrane device, and the concentrate is returned to the<br>
activated sludge tank. The separation membrane may be prepared in a<br>
plurality of rows, as needed. Since the plurality of rows allows<br>
conducting separation operation in each row, or allow stopping the<br>
separation operation in each row, the wastewater treatment speed can be<br>
adjusted.<br><br>
[0017] The device which is applied to the above wastewater treatment<br>
process includes, for example, the one shown in Fig. 1.<br>
[0018] An organic wastewater 1 entering the activated sludge tank is<br>
treated by a preliminary treatment device 2 to remove the foreign<br>
substances, and then is temporarily stored in a flow equalization tank 3.<br>
After that, the organic wastewater is supplied to an activated sludge tank<br>
(aeration tank) 4 from the flow equalization tank 3 at a constant flow<br>
rate.<br>
[0019] In the activated sludge tank 4, the microorganisms in the<br>
activated sludge held in the tank decompose to remove the organic<br>
substances (BOD components) in the organic wastewater 1. The solid-<br>
liquid separation of the activated sludge mixed liquor in the activated<br>
sludge tank 4 is conducted in the separation membrane device 5<br>
immersed in the tank. A skirt 6 and a blower 7 are positioned beneath<br>
the separation membrane device 5, and the blower feeds a gas to the<br>
skirt. A filtrate 9 separated in the separation membrane device 5 is<br>
sucked by a suction pump 8, and is discharged as a treated liquor 11,<br>
after, as needed, sterilized in a sterilization tank 10. In the activated<br>
sludge tank 4, the microorganisms decompose the BOD components<br>
and discharge the metabolic products therefrom. Regarding the<br>
biopolymers composed mainly of sugar and proteins, as the metabolic<br>
products of the microorganisms, specifically for the case that organic<br>
substances excessively enter the activated sludge tank, and for the case<br>
that the variations of concentration of organic substances in the inflow<br>
water are significant, if an oxidant, an acidic liquor, a basic liquor, or the<br>
like enters the activated sludge tank, excess quantity of biopolymers is<br><br>
discharged from the microorganisms to enhance the clogging of the<br>
separation membrane. According to the present invention, however,<br>
the measurement of sugar concentration, preferably the uronic acid<br>
concentration, in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge held in the<br>
activated sludge tank 4 allows adequately evaluating the risk of<br>
clogging the separation membrane caused by the biopolymers.<br>
[0020] The wastewater which can receive the effect of the treatment of<br>
the method according to the present invention includes food factory<br>
wastewater, sugar factory wastewater, detergent factory wastewater,<br>
starch factory wastewater, and tofti factory wastewater, and higher effect<br>
is expected for wastewater having BOD of 100 mg/L or more.<br>
[0021] According to the present invention, the sugar concentration in<br>
the aqueous phase of the activated sludge is required to be maintained at<br>
or below a specified value. The upper limit of the specified values of<br>
the sugar concentration is required to be 100 mg/L or less. If the value<br>
exceeds the upper limit, the clogging of separation membrane caused by<br>
the biopolymers and the activated sludge becomes significant, and the<br>
filtration pressure increases. Preferred sugar concentration is 80 mg/L<br>
or less, more preferably 50 mg/L or less, and most preferably about 30<br>
mg/L.<br>
[0022] Lower sugar concentration is more preferable because the<br>
clogging of the membrane becomes less. However, lower sugar<br>
concentration decreases the capacity of wastewater treatment,<br>
accordingly. Considering the balance between the capacity of<br>
wastewater treatment and the clogging, the lower limit of the sugar<br>
concentration has to be specified to 5 mg/L, preferably to 10 mg/L, and<br><br>
more preferably to about 20 mg/L.<br>
[0023] It is more preferable that the uronic acid concentration, instead<br>
of the sugar concentration, is maintained within the above specified<br>
values, which allows further accurately grasping the risk of clogging of<br>
the membrane. Particularly when the organic wastewater entering the<br>
activated sludge tank contains a large quantity of sugar, use of the sugar<br>
concentration as the index of clogging substances gives the<br>
measurement of sugar originated from the organic wastewater, adding to<br>
the measurement of the target sugar as the biopolymers, which may lead<br>
to the evaluation of excessively large quantity of clogging substances.<br>
In that case, measurement of uronic acid concentration provides more<br>
accurate evaluation of the clogging. More preferable upper limit of the<br>
uronic acid concentration is 50 mg/L or less, further preferably 30 mg/L<br>
or less, still further preferably 20 mg/L or less, and most preferably 10<br>
mg/L. Preferred lower limit of the uronic acid concentration is 3 mg/L<br>
or more, and more preferably 5 mg/L or more.<br>
[0024] Furthermore, each concentration is preferably determined<br>
depending on the filtration flux. According to the present invention,<br>
the filtration flux is normally in a range from 0.1 to 1.0 m/D, and 0.4 to<br>
0.8 m/D is preferred in view of allowing efficient wastewater treatment.<br>
As a target level of sugar concentration in that case, the following<br>
ranges are the most preferable:<br>
80 mg/L or less for 0.2 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device;<br>
50 mg/L or less for 0.4 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device;<br><br>
30 mg/L or less for 0.6 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device; and<br>
10 mg/L or less for 0.8 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device.<br>
The filtration flux of 0.6 m/D signifies the operation allowing<br>
the filtrate of 0.6 m to pass 1 m of filtration area in 24 hours.<br>
[0025] Although the method for measuring the sugar concentration is<br>
not specifically limited, there is a method, for example, in which the<br>
phenol-sulfuric acid method is applied for the measurement, and the<br>
working curve prepared by glucose is used to determine the sugar<br>
concentration.<br>
[0026] For measuring the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid<br>
concentration, it is preferable that the activated sludge is filtered by a<br>
filter medium such as filter paper which has larger pore size than that of<br>
the separation membrane of the separation membrane device to obtain<br>
the sludge filtrate, and then by measuring the sugar concentration and/or<br>
the uronic acid concentration of thus obtained filtrate. By the<br>
operation, the filter medium captures only the suspended solids in the<br>
activated sludge, while allowing the sugar components to pass through<br>
the filter paper. Consequently, by measuring the sugar concentration<br>
and/or the uronic acid concentration in the filtrate, the concentration of<br>
biopolymers which become the clogging substance to the membrane can<br>
be more accurately determined.<br>
[0027] The pore size of the filter medium is preferably 5 times the pore<br>
size of separation membrane mounted on the separation membrane<br>
device, and more preferably 10 times or more. It is preferable that the<br><br>
pore size of the filter medium has the upper limit of about 100 times or<br>
less the pore size of the separation membrane mounted on the separation<br>
membrane device, and that the upper limit of the pore size of the filter<br>
medium is 10 urn. Furthermore, a hydrophilic material is preferable<br>
owing to the less adsorption of the sugar components. That type of<br>
filter medium includes a filter paper made from cellulose, for example.<br>
[0028] The concentration of uronic acid can be determined on a<br>
working curve prepared using polygalacturonic acid which is a<br>
polyuronic acid, in accordance with the method described in "New<br>
Method for Quantitative Determination of Uronic Acid", Nelly<br>
Blumenkrantz and Gustav Asboe-Hansen, ANALYTICAL<br>
BIOCHEMISTRY, vol. 54, pp. 484-489, (1973). The method follows<br>
the steps of:<br>
(1)	putting 0.5 mL of sludge filtrate and an aqueous solution of<br>
polygalacturonic acid at a known concentration in separate test tubes,<br>
respectively, and adding 3.0 mL of 0.0125M Na2B4O7 conc.sulfuric acid<br>
solution to each test tube;<br>
(2)	fully shaking each liquid in each test tube, and warming the<br>
liquid in a boiling bath for 5 minutes, and then cooling the liquid in ice<br>
water for 20 minutes;<br>
(3)	adding 50 µL of 0.5% NaOH solution of 0.15% m-<br>
hydroxydiphenyl to each liquid; and<br>
(4)	after fully agitating the liquid, allowing the liquid to stand for 5<br>
minutes, and determining the 520 nm absorbance of the liquid, and then<br>
comparing the determined absorbance between that of the aqueous<br>
solution of polygalacturonic acid of the known concentration and that of<br><br>
the sludge filtrate to derive the concentration of polygalacturonic acid.<br>
[0029] The changes in the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid<br>
concentration with time can be determined by measuring regularly the<br>
sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration once every<br>
several hours or several days, for example.<br>
Regular measurement of the sugar concentration and/or the<br>
uronic acid concentration gives indication of increase in the sugar<br>
concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration, or of increase in the<br>
concentration of biopolymers, which allows applying preventive<br>
measures before clogging the membrane. It is most preferable that the<br>
sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration are monitored<br>
always to adjust their concentration level within a specified range.<br>
[0030] To cause the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge to be within<br>
the specified range, there is applied, for example, a method to<br>
increase/decrease the quantity of organic substances [kg] to the quantity<br>
of activated sludge in the activated sludge tank. The quantity of<br>
organic substances to the quantity of activated sludge is called the<br>
"BOD-SS load". As an index of the quantity of organic substances,<br>
there is applied BOD [kg/day] entering the activated sludge tank per day.<br>
The inventors of the present invention found that the BOD-SS<br>
load has a close relation to the sugar concentration and/or the uronic<br>
acid concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge. High<br>
BOD-SS load indicates the state in which larger quantities of organic<br>
substances as the feed to microorganisms exist compared with the<br>
quantity of microorganisms. Once that state is established, the<br><br>
microorganisms actively perform metabolic activity, thus discharging<br>
excess quantity of biopolymers, or sugar, acting as the clogging<br>
substances. Inversely, if the microorganisms are brought into a<br>
starvation state, the metabolic activity decreases to stop discharging the<br>
biopolymers, and furthermore, the sugar concentration becomes further<br>
low because the microorganisms presumably consume sugar.<br>
[0031] Consequently, if the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid<br>
concentration increase, the BOD-SS load is decreased, and if the sugar<br>
concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration decrease, the BOD-<br>
SS load is increased as the respective counter actions. These actions<br>
prevent the adhesion of biopolymers to the membrane, and allow stable<br>
continuation of solid-liquid separation without clogging the membrane.<br>
[0032] A method to increase/decrease the BOD-SS load is the<br>
increase/decrease of the quantity of organic substances in the activated<br>
sludge tank. Specific methods thereof include: (1) a method to<br>
increase/decrease the quantity of organic wastewater entering the<br>
activated sludge tank; (2) a method to increase/decrease the quantity of<br>
organic wastewater entering the activated sludge tank and<br>
increase/decrease the quantity of filtrate discharged from the activated<br>
sludge tank, which filtrate is prepared by solid-liquid separation in the<br>
separation membrane device; and (3) a method to increase/decrease the<br>
filtration flux.<br>
[0033] The methods to increase/decrease the quantity of organic<br>
substances are not limited to the ones given above, and other methods<br>
can be applied. For example, there are: a method to remove the<br>
organic substances from the organic wastewater by separating the solid<br><br>
organic substances using a filter medium; a method to increase the<br>
concentration of activated sludge by decreasing the quantity of<br>
withdrawing excess sludge, or a method to increase/decrease the<br>
concentration of activated sludge by controlling the quantity of<br>
withdrawing excess sludge; a method to decrease the quantity of<br>
activated sludge in the activated sludge tank by lowering the liquid level<br>
in the activated sludge tank, or a method to increase/decrease the<br>
quantity of activated sludge by controlling the volume of activated<br>
sludge through the control of liquid level in the activated sludge tank;<br>
and a method to add water to the activated sludge tank.<br>
[0034] Among these methods, the method to increase/decrease the<br>
quantity of organic wastewater entering the activated sludge tank is the<br>
simplest one, and is preferred. Specifically, decrease in the quantity of<br>
organic wastewater entering the activated sludge tank can decrease the<br>
sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration. On the other<br>
hand, if the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration are<br>
lower than the respectively specified values, increase in the quantity of<br>
organic wastewater entering the activated sludge tank can increase the<br>
sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration. By this<br>
operation, the efficiency of wastewater treatment can be increased while<br>
preventing clogging of separation membrane.<br>
[0035] The quantity of increase/decrease of the organic wastewater<br>
entering the activated sludge tank and the quantity of increase/decrease<br>
of the BOD-SS load are required to be determined for each organic<br>
wastewater to be treated. For example, if the quantity of organic<br>
wastewater entering the activated sludge tank is decreased by half, or<br><br>
the BOD-SS load is decreased by half, the trend of magnitude of<br>
variations of increase/decrease in the sugar concentration and/or the<br>
uronic acid concentration is grasped. Then, based on thus grasped<br>
trend, the degree of increase/decrease of the quantity of organic<br>
wastewater is decided.<br>
[0036] Although the detail quantity of increase/decrease in the organic<br>
wastewater depends on the size of the activated sludge tank, the kind of<br>
the activated sludge, and the like, when, for instance, the sugar<br>
concentration and/or the uronic acid concentration increased, the<br>
decrease in the BOD-SS load to an approximate level of 0.02 kg-<br>
BOD/(kg-day) allows the sugar concentration and/or the uronic acid<br>
concentration to decrease to about half the original concentration in<br>
about one week.<br>
[0037] As described above, among the biopolymers such as sugar,<br>
proteins, and nucleic acids, the biopolymers adhered to the surface of<br>
separation membrane to induce clogging are mainly polymers having<br>
sugar, specifically uronic acid, as the major component. Therefore, as<br>
described in the present invention, maintaining the sugar concentration<br>
and/or the uronic acid concentration within the respectively specified<br>
ranges can prevent the biopolymers from adhering to the membrane<br>
surface and increasing the membrane filtration resistance. The<br>
separation membrane comes to clog after a certain period of use, and<br>
needs to undergo cleaning. According to the method of the present<br>
invention, however, the frequency of cleaning can be minimized. In<br>
addition, since the method of the present invention evaluates the risk of<br>
decreasing the membrane area using the sugar concentration and/or the<br><br>
uronic acid concentrations, there can be avoided the overvaluation of<br>
the risk to detect also the biopolymers which can pass through the<br>
separation membrane. As a result, the prevention of adhesion of the<br>
biopolymers to the separation membrane is conducted at a necessary<br>
and sufficient level, and the decrease in the work efficiency of<br>
wastewater treatment can be also prevented.<br>
Examples<br>
[0038] The examples of the present invention are described below.<br>
The present invention, however, is not limited to these examples.<br>
[0039] (Specifying biopolymers adhering to the separation membrane)<br>
For the case that an organic wastewater discharged from a sugar<br>
factory and a detergent factory, respectively, is treated by the membrane<br>
separation activated sludge process, the substances that clog the<br>
separation membrane were specified by the following method.<br>
[0040] First, an activated sludge containing organic wastewater was<br>
filtered using a filter paper (5C (trade name), made of cellulose,<br>
manufactured by Advantech Co., Ltd.) having 1 urn of pore size. The<br>
obtained filtrate (hereinafter referred to as the "sludge filtrate") was<br>
filtered using a hollow fiber membrane (made of PVDF, 0.02 m2 of<br>
membrane area, 15 cm of effective membrane length, 0.6/1.2 mm of<br>
inner diameter/outer diameter, manufactured by Asahi Chemicals<br>
Corporation) having 0.1 urn of pore size, for total 7 cycles, each cycle<br>
being composed of 9 minutes of filtration and 1 minute of backwashing.<br>
[0041] The filtration resistance Rc has a relation given by the formula<br>
(I). By plotting the values (pressure difference across the membrane,<br>
viscosity, and flux) obtained by the above membrane filtration<br><br>
experiment, an approximation line of the relation between Pn/(µJ) and n<br>
was drawn. From the inclination of the line, Rc was determined.<br><br>
where, n is the number of filtration cycles; Pn is the average value of the<br>
pressure difference across the membrane at n-th cycle, [Pa]; µ is the<br>
viscosity of water [Pa-s]; and J is the flux [m/D].<br>
The sugar concentration in the filtrate was determined by the<br>
phenol-sulfuric acid method. On drawing the working curve, the<br>
concentration was determined using glucose. As a result, as shown in<br>
Fig. 2, there was confirmed the existence of a proportional relation<br>
between the calculated filtration resistance and the sugar concentration<br>
in the filtrate.<br>
[0042] As for the concentration of uronic acid, the concentration of<br>
polygalacturonic acid was determined in accordance with the method<br>
described in the above-given "New Method for Quantitative<br>
Determination of Uronic Acid", ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY, vol.<br>
54, pp. 484-489, (1973). The method follows the steps of:<br>
(1)	putting 0.5 mL of sludge filtrate and an aqueous solution of<br>
polygalacturonic acid at a known concentration in separate test tubes,<br>
respectively, and adding 3.0 mL of 0.0125M Na2B4O7 conc.sulfuric acid<br>
solution to each test tube;<br>
(2)	fully shaking each liquid in each test tube, and warming the<br>
liquid in a boiling bath for 5 minutes, and then cooling the liquid in ice<br>
water for 20 minutes;<br>
(3)	adding 50 µL of 0.5% NaOH solution of 0.15% m-<br>
hydroxydiphenyl to each liquid; and<br><br>
(4) after fully agitating the liquid, allowing the liquid to stand for 5<br>
minutes, and determining the 520 nm absorbance of the liquid, and then<br>
comparing the determined absorbance between that of the aqueous<br>
solution of polygalacruronic acid of the known concentration and that of<br>
the sludge filtrate to derive the concentration of polygalacruronic acid.<br>
[0043] The result showed, as given in Fig. 4, that the sugar<br>
concentration in the above sludge filtrate has nearly proportional<br>
relation to the concentration of uronic acid which is a sugar.<br>
[0044] Furthermore, the molecular weight distribution of the liquor<br>
before membrane filtration and of the permeate after membrane<br>
filtration, respectively, was determined by high-performance liquid<br>
chromatography, which result is given in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, respectively.<br>
Varieties of PVAs, each of which molecular weight was known, were<br>
analyzed by the high-performance liquid chromatography to determine<br>
the relation between the generated holding time and the molecular<br>
weight, and the relation was applied to convert the holding time into the<br>
molecular weight, which derived molecular weight was adopted as the<br>
horizontal axis of Fig. 5 and Fig. 6. As seen in these figures, the peak<br>
height appeared in a range from several hundreds of thousands to<br>
several millions of molecular weight, in Fig. 5, became small in Fig. 6,<br>
which showed the decrease in the quantity of substances having that<br>
molecular weight caused by the membrane filtration.<br>
[0045] The above result suggests that the substances clogging the<br>
membrane in the membrane separation activated sludge process are the<br>
uronic acid-containing polymers composed mainly of sugar and having<br>
molecular weights ranging from several hundreds of thousands to<br><br>
several millions.<br>
[0046] Separately, a liquor prepared by dissolving polygalacturonic acid<br>
in the sludge filtrate, at four respective concentrations of 40 mg/L, 60<br>
mg/L, 80 mg/L, and 100 mg/L, was used to determine the filtration<br>
resistance. The result is, as shown in Fig. 2, that the liquor dissolving<br>
polygalacturonic acid showed larger inclination of the resistance curve<br>
than that of the filtrate of activated sludge passed through a filter paper.<br>
That is, among sugars, the liquor containing larger quantity of uronic<br>
acid gave larger filtration resistance.<br>
[0047] Separately, conforming to the method of Japanese Patent Laid-<br>
Open No. 2005-40747, (Patent Document 2), an activated sludge was<br>
filtered by the filter paper same to that of above case. The difference<br>
between the COD of thus obtained filtrate and the COD of permeate<br>
obtained by further filtering the above filtrate using the above hollow<br>
fiber membrane was determined to adopt as the COD difference value,<br>
which COD difference values were plotted on Fig. 3. Since the COD<br>
difference values include the values based on the components capable of<br>
passing through the membrane, the comparison with the sugar<br>
concentration in terms of the filtration resistance showed that the<br>
adoption of COD difference value gave larger error.<br>
[0048] Therefore, the measurement of sugar concentration in the<br>
aqueous phase of the activated sludge, preferably the measurement of<br>
uronic acid concentration showed to give more accurate evaluation on<br>
the quantity of substances adhering to the surface of the separation<br>
membrane among the biopolymers.<br>
[0049] (Confirming capability of controlling the sugar concentration)<br><br>
Conforming to the following method, it was confirmed that the<br>
increase/decrease in the BOD-SS load can control the sugar<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge.<br>
[0050] First, three respective kinds of organic wastewater, namely the<br>
wastewater of sugar factory, the wastewater of detergent factory, and the<br>
wastewater of tofu factory, were subjected to membrane separation<br>
activated sludge treatment in continuous operating mode in accordance<br>
with the process shown in Fig. 1. Each wastewater was diluted by<br>
water to vary the BOD-SS value, and the sugar concentration and the<br>
uronic acid concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge<br>
under various BOD-SS loads were determined. As for the sugar<br>
concentration, the filtrate obtained by filtering the activated sludge<br>
using a filter paper (5C (trade name), made of cellulose, manufactured<br>
by Advantech Co., Ltd.) was analyzed by the phenol-sulfuric acid<br>
method, and the working curve prepared by glucose was used to<br>
determine the sugar concentration. The uronic acid concentration was<br>
derived using a working curve of polygalacturonic acid using the<br>
procedure similar to that given above. The membrane separation<br>
treatment was conducted using the hollow fiber membrane same to that<br>
of above case as the separation membrane.<br>
[0051] The result is given in Fig. 7. When the BOD-SS load in the<br>
activated sludge tank was high, the sugar concentration and the uronic<br>
acid concentration increased. Conversely, when the BOD-SS load<br>
therein was set to a low level, the sugar concentration and the uronic<br>
acid concentration became low.<br>
[0052] As a result, it was confirmed that an extremely simple process of<br><br>
controlling the BOD-SS load achieves the control to keep the sugar<br>
concentration and the uronic acid concentration within the respectively<br>
specified ranges.<br>
(Example 1 and Comparative Example 1)<br>
In the process shown in Fig. 1, the wastewater of sugar factory,<br>
having 750 mg/L of BOD, was treated by the membrane separation<br>
activated sludge process in continuous operating mode. The<br>
concentration of sugar and uronic acid in the wastewater was 60 mg/L<br>
and 0 mg/L, respectively.<br>
[0053] As the separation membrane device 5, a separation membrane<br>
device (made of PVDF, 0.015 m of membrane area, 15 cm of effective<br>
membrane length, 0.6/1.2 mm of inner diameter/outer diameter,<br>
manufactured by Asahi Chemicals Corporation) composed of a module<br>
of precision filtration hollow fiber membrane having 0.1 urn of pore<br>
size was prepared, which device 5 was then immersed in the activated<br>
sludge tank 4 having 10 L of effective capacity. The MLSS<br>
concentration in the activated sludge tank was kept constant to 10 g/L,<br>
and the retention time of wastewater in the activated sludge tank 4 was<br>
regulated to 18 hours. The filtration pressure at the beginning of the<br>
treatment was 4 kPa. The liquid quantity of the activated sludge was<br>
kept constant. The separation membrane device 5 was divided into<br>
two lines having the same membrane area with each other, the filtration<br>
flux was set to 0.6 m/D for each line, and the entire filtrate was<br>
discharged outside the activated sludge tank 4. The sugar<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase in the activated sludge tank 4 was<br>
regulated to 50 mg/L of upper limit and 20 mg/L of lower limit. The<br><br>
uromic acid concentration was regulated to 18 mg/L of upper limit and 5<br>
mg/L of lower limit. The aeration to the membrane was executed by<br>
supplying air from beneath the membrane module at a flow rate of 200<br>
L/hr.<br>
[0054] As for the sugar concentration, the filtrate obtained by filtering<br>
the activated sludge using a filter paper (5C, made of cellulose, 1 urn of<br>
pore size, manufactured by Advantech Co., Ltd.) was analyzed by the<br>
phenol-sulfuric acid method, and the working curve prepared by glucose<br>
was used to determine the sugar concentration. The uronic acid<br>
concentration was derived using a working curve of polygalacturonic<br>
acid using the procedure same to that given above.<br>
[0055] The sugar concentration and the uronic acid concentration in the<br>
aqueous phase of the activated sludge were determined once every day.<br>
The result is given in Fig. 8. After about one week had passed since<br>
the beginning of operation, the sugar concentration and the uronic acid<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge abruptly<br>
increased, and on 11th day, the concentration of sugar and uronic acid<br>
became 50 mg/L and 20 mg/L, respectively. By stopping one line of<br>
the separation membrane device 5, both the quantity of discharging the<br>
filtrate outside the activated sludge tank and the quantity of wastewater<br>
entering the activated sludge tank decreased by half, respectively, thus<br>
decreased the concentration of sugar and uronic acid to 20 mg/L and 5<br>
mg/L, respectively. After that, the one line operation was continued,<br>
and the operation was stable without giving abrupt increase in the<br>
pressure difference across the membrane, as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
[0056] The wastewater same to that in Example 1 was treated using the<br><br>
same system to that of Example 1. After 20 days had passed since the<br>
beginning of the treatment, the sugar concentration became 80 mg/L,<br>
and the uronic acid concentration became 35 mg/L. The operation was<br>
continued in that state. Then, the filtration pressure exceeded 25 kPa,<br>
and cleaning of separation membrane was required.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
With the process shown in Fig. 1, the wastewater of sugar<br>
factory, having 250 mg/L of BOD, was treated by the membrane<br>
separation activated sludge process in continuous operating mode. The<br>
concentration of sugar and uronic acid in the wastewater was 30 mg/L<br>
and 0 mg/L, respectively. As the separation membrane device 5, a<br>
separation membrane device (made of PVDF, 0.015 m of membrane<br>
area, 15 cm of effective membrane length, 0.6/1.2 mm of inner<br>
diameter/outer diameter, manufactured by Asahi Chemicals<br>
Corporation) composed of a module of precision filtration hollow fiber<br>
membrane having 0.1 µm of pore size was prepared, which device 5<br>
was then immersed in the activated sludge tank 4 having 10 L of<br>
effective capacity. The MLSS concentration was kept constant to 10<br>
g/L, and the retention time of wastewater in the activated sludge tank 4<br>
was regulated to 18 hours. The filtration pressure at the beginning of<br>
the treatment was 4 kPa. The liquid quantity of the activated sludge<br>
was kept constant. A separation membrane device of a single line was<br>
installed. The filtration flux was set to 0.6 m/D, and the entire filtrate<br>
was discharged outside the activated sludge tank 4. The sugar<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase in the activated sludge tank 4 was<br>
regulated to 70 mg/L of upper limit and 10 mg/L of lower limit. The<br><br>
uronic acid concentration was regulated to 20 mg/L of upper limit and 5<br>
mg/L of lower limit. The aeration to the membrane was executed by<br>
supplying air from beneath the membrane module at a flow rate of 200<br>
L/hr.<br>
[0057] As for the sugar concentration, the filtrate obtained by filtering<br>
the activated sludge using a filter paper (5C, made of cellulose, 1 µm of<br>
pore size, manufactured by Advantech Co., Ltd.) was analyzed by the<br>
phenol-sulfuric acid method, similar to that described above, and the<br>
working curve prepared by glucose was used to determine the sugar<br>
concentration. The uronic acid concentration was derived using a<br>
working curve of polygalacturonic acid using the procedure similar to<br>
that given above.<br>
[0058] The sugar concentration and the uronic acid concentration in the<br>
aqueous phase of the activated sludge were determined once every day.<br>
The result is given in Fig. 9. Even after about one week had passed<br>
since the beginning of operation, the sugar concentration and the uronic<br>
acid concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge stayed at<br>
about 5 mg/L and about 2 mg/L, respectively, giving the values far<br>
below the specified values. Then, on 8th day after beginning the<br>
operation, the membrane area of the separation membrane device was<br>
increased by double, and the inflow rate of wastewater to the activated<br>
sludge tank was increased by double. After that, although the<br>
concentration of sugar and uronic acid increased to 20 mg/L and 7 mg/L,<br>
respectively, no further increase occurred. That is, even by doubling<br>
the inflow rate of wastewater, the pressure difference across the<br>
membrane did not show the rapid increase, and stable operation was<br><br>
attained.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
With the process shown in Fig. 1, the wastewater of starch<br>
factory, having 750 mg/L of BOD, was treated by the membrane<br>
separation activated sludge process in continuous operating mode. The<br>
concentration of sugar and uronic acid in the wastewater was 800 mg/L<br>
and 0 mg/L, respectively. The sugar concentration in the wastewater<br>
was about 800 mg/L. As the separation membrane, the separation<br>
membrane device same to that in Example 2 was immersed. The<br>
MLSS concentration was kept constant to 10 g/L, and the retention time<br>
of the wastewater of sugar factory in the activated sludge tank was<br>
regulated to 18 hours. The quantity of the activated sludge was kept<br>
constant. A separation membrane device of a single line was installed.<br>
The filtration flux was set to 0.6 m/D, and the entire filtrate was<br>
discharged outside the activated sludge tank 4. The aeration to the<br>
membrane was executed by supplying air from beneath the membrane<br>
module at a flow rate of 200 L/hr.<br>
[0059] As for the sugar concentration, the filtrate obtained by filtering<br>
the activated sludge using a filter paper (5C, 1 urn of pore size,<br>
manufactured by Advantech Co., Ltd.) was analyzed by the phenol-<br>
sulfuric acid method, and the working curve prepared by glucose was<br>
used to determine the sugar concentration. The uronic acid<br>
concentration was derived using a working curve of polygalacturonic<br>
acid using the procedure same to that given above.<br>
[0060] The initial filtration pressure was 5 kPa. On 25th day since the<br>
beginning of the operation, the sugar concentration was 80 mg/L as<br><br>
glucose. When, however, the uronic acid concentration was<br>
determined on that day, it was 17 mg/L as polygalacturonic acid. The<br>
pressure difference across the membrane did not increase, and the value<br>
was 13 kPa on 25th day compared with 10 kPa at the beginning. That<br>
is, the determination of uronic acid concentration more accurately<br>
predicts the clogging.<br>
(Example 4)<br>
The same wastewater to that treated in Example 1 was treated by<br>
similar method to that of Example 1. As the separation membrane<br>
device 5, a separation membrane device (made of PVDF, 0.022 m of<br>
membrane area, 15 cm of effective membrane length, 0.6/1.2 mm of<br>
inner diameter/outer diameter, manufactured by Asahi Chemicals<br>
Corporation) composed of a module of precision filtration hollow fiber<br>
membrane having 0.1 µm of pore size was used.<br>
[0061] For each example, the uronic acid concentration and the sugar<br>
concentration in the aqueous phase of the activated sludge were<br>
determined once every day. At each uronic acid concentration, there<br>
was determined the filtration flux at which the membrane filtration<br>
pressure stayed within 10 kPa of increase from the initial pressure even<br>
after 20 days had passed since the beginning of the operation. Table 1<br>
shows the result.<br>
[0062] [Table 1]<br><br><br>
[0063] The experimental result showed that the best conditions for the<br>
uronic acid concentration and the flux value are the following:<br>
10 mg/L or less for 0.8 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device;<br>
20 mg/L or less for 0.6 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device; and<br>
30 mg/L or less for 0.4 m/D of filtration flux in the separation<br>
membrane device.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0064] The present invention provides a method of treating wastewater<br>
efficiently while preventing increase in the membrane filtration<br>
resistance by adequately evaluating the risk of decreasing effective<br>
membrane area caused by the adhesion of biopolymers to the membrane<br>
surface. As a result, the method of the present invention can be<br>
effectively applied to reclamation treatment of wastewater of varieties<br>
of factories.<br><br>

microorganisms therein; and a separation step of biologically treating the organic<br>
wastewater in the activated sludge tank and then subjecting thus treated liquor to<br>
solid-liquid separation with the use of a separation membrane device located in<br>
the activated sludge tank, wherein the sugar concentration in the aqueous phase<br>
of the activated sludge is maintained within a specified range in the separation<br>
step.</td>
