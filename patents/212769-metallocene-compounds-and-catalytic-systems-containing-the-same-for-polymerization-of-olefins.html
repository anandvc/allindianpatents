METALLOCENE   COMPOUNDS,  PROCESS   FOR  THEIR  PREPARATION  AND<br>
THEIR   USE   IN   CATALYTIC   SYSTEMS   FOR   THE   POLYMERIZATION   OF<br>
OLEFINS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new class of metallocene compounds, to a catalyst for the polymerization of olefins containing them and to a polymerization process carried out in the presence of said catalyst. The invention also relates to the corresponding ligands useful as intermediates in the synthesis of said metallocene compounds, as well as to processes for preparing said ligands and said metallocene compounds. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Metallocene compounds with two cyclopentadienyl groups are known as catalyst components for the polymerization of olefins. European Patent 129,368, for instance, describes a catalyst system for the polymerization of olefins comprising (a) a bis-cyclopentadienyl coordination complex with a transition metal and (b) an alumoxane. The two cyclopentadienyl groups can be linked by a divalent group.<br>
More recently, heterocyclic metallocene compounds used in the polymerization of alpha-olefins have been described. For example, US Patent 5,489,659 relates to a class of silicon-containing metallocene compounds for the polymerization of alpha-olefins wherein the silicon atom is part of a non-aromatic ring condensed to the cyclopentadienyl ring. Metallocenes of this type are used in the polymerization of propylene. The activity of these metallocene-based catalysts is not satisfactory.<br>
In International application WO 98/22486 it is described a class of metallocenes containing a cyclopentadienyl radical directly coordinating the central metal atom, to which are fused one or more rings containing at least one heteroatom. These metallocenes, in combination with a suitable cocatalyst, are used in the polymerization of olefins, such as propylene. However, the molecular weights that can be obtained at polymerization temperatures of industrial interest are still too low for most utilization and the activity of those catalyst systems, when used in the polymerization of propylene, is not satisfactory.<br>
It would be desirable to provide a novel class of metallocenes which, when used in catalysts for the polymerization of olefins, in particular of propylene, have high activity such that the amount of the catalyst remaining in the formed polymer is minimized. Furthermore high-<br><br>
activity catalyst capable of yielding polymers endowed with high molecular weights, narrow<br>
molecular weight distribution as well as a high degree of isotacticity and thus of crystallinity<br>
would be desirable.<br>
A novel class of metallocene compounds has now been unexpectedly found, which achieves<br>
the above and other results.<br>

Non limitative examples of compounds able to form a metallocene alkyl cation are compounds<br><br>
of formula D+E-, wherein D+  is a Bronsted acid, able to give a proton and to react irreversibly<br>
with a substituent X of the metallocene of formula (I) and E- is a compatible anion, which is able<br>
to stabilize the active catalytic species originating from the reaction of the two compounds, and<br>
which is sufficiently labile to be able to be removed by an olefinic monomer.  Preferably, the<br>
anion V comprises one or more boron atoms. More preferably, the anion V- is an anion of the<br>
formula BAr(-)4, wherein substituents Ar, the same or different from each other, are aryl radicals<br>
such as phenyl, pentafluorophenyl, bis(trifluoromethyl)phenyl. Particularly preferred is the<br>
tetrakis-pentafluorophenyl borate. Furthermore, compounds of formula BAr3 can be suitably<br>
used wherein Ar is a C7-C20 aryl group optionally substituted with heteroatoms.<br>
The catalysts used in the process of the present invention can be also used on inert supports. This<br>
is obtained by depositing the metallocene (A), or the product of the reaction of the same with the<br>
component (B), or the component (B) and thereafter the metallocene (A), on supports such as for<br>
example silica, alumina, styrene-divinylbenzene copolymers, polyethylene or polypropylene.<br>
The solid compound so obtained, in combination with further addition of the alkyl aluminum<br>
compound as such or pre-reacted with water, is usefully employed in gas phase polymerisation.<br>
Catalysts of the present invention are useful in the homo- and copolymerization reaction of<br>
olefins.<br>
Therefore, a still further object of the present invention is a process for the polymerization of one<br>
or more olefins comprising the polymerization reaction of one or more olefinic monomer in the<br>
presence of a catalyst as above described.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention can be used in the homo-polymerisation reaction of<br>
olefins, such as ethylene for the preparation of HDPE, or of alpha-olefins, such as propylene and<br>
1 -butene.<br>
Particular interesting results are achieved in the polymerisation of propylene carried out in the<br>
presence of the above-described catalyst containing the metallocene of the present invention.<br>
It has been found that when the polymerization of propylene is carried out in the presence of<br>
the metallocene compounds of the present, the molecular weight of the obtained propylene<br>
polymers are unexpectedly high. The intrinsic viscosity (I.V.) of the obtained polypropylene is<br>
generally higher than 0.5 dL/g preferably 1 dL/g and can reach values as high as 5 dL/g or<br>
even higher.<br>
The obtained propylene polymers are characterized by high isotacticity values. Thus the<br><br>
amount of sequences mrrm (in mol %) is extremely low. In generally the amount of sequences<br>
mrrm (in mol %) is lower than 1, preferably lower than 0.5.<br>
When the polymerization of propylene is carried out in the presence of the metallocene<br>
compounds of the present invention the melting point of the obtained polypropylene is<br>
considerably high. In generally the melting point of the obtained polypropylene is higher than<br>
145°C and can reach values of 160°C or even higher.<br>
Particularly interesting results are obtained when the catalyst of the present invention, in<br>
particular when both Y and Z belong to formula (II) and R3 is C6-C20 aryl C7'C20 alkyl aryl or<br>
C7-C20 arylalkyl, is used in conjunction with compounds able to form a metallocene alkyl<br>
cation of formula T+V-- wherein T and V are described above. With these cocatalyst is possible<br>
to obtain highly isospecific polymers with very low regio-error contents.<br>
A still further advantageous characteristic of the metallocenes of the invention is that the use of a<br>
small amount of hydrogen, besides regulating the molecular weight, entails a considerable<br>
increase of the polymerization activities.<br>
The catalysts according to the present invention can be used also in a process as described above<br>
for the copolymerization of propylene with one or more alpha-olefins such as for example<br>
ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 1-dodecene, 1-<br>
tetradecene,  1-esadecene, 1-octadecene, 1-eicosene, allylcyclohexene, cyclopentene, styrene,<br>
cyclohexene, norbomene and 4,6-dimethyl-l-heptene.  Copolymers propylene/ethylene and<br>
propylene/1-butene are preferred. When 1-butene is used as comonomer, copolymers with<br>
relatively high molecular weight but relatively low melting point are obtained.<br>
In the propylene/ethylene copolymers the addition of ethylene strongly reduces the molecular<br>
weight of the copolymers, that means that ethylene can be used as molecular weight regulating<br>
as well.<br>
Another interesting  use  of the  catalysts  according  to  the  present  invention  is  in  the<br>
copolymerization of ethylene with higher olefins. In particular, the catalysts of the invention can<br>
be used for the preparation of LLDPE.<br>
Suitable olefins to be used as comonomers comprise a-olefins of the formula CH2=CHR,<br>
wherein R20  is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl radical having from<br>
6 to 20 carbon atoms, and cycloolefins. Examples of these olefins are propylene, 1-butene, 1-<br>
pentene, 4-methyl-1 -pentene,  1 -hexene,   1 -octene,   1 -decene,   1 -dodecene,   1 -tetradecene,   1 -<br><br>
esadecene, 1-octadecene, 1-eicosene, allylcyclohexene, cyclopentene, styrene, cyclohexene, norbomene and 4,6-dimethyl-l-heptene.<br>
The copolymers may also contain small proportions of units deriving from polyenes, in particular from straight or cyclic, conjugated or non conjugated dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene, isoprene, 1,3-butadiene, 1,5-hexadiene and 1,6-heptadiene.<br>
The units deriving from a-olefins of formula CH2=CHR20, R20 is an alkyl radical having from 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an aryl radical having from 6 to 20 carbon atoms, from cycloolefins and/or from polienes are present in the copolymers preferably in amounts ranging from 1% to 20% by mole.<br>
The saturated elastomeric copolymers can contain ethylene units and a-olefins and/or non conjugated diolefins able to cyclopolymerise. The unsaturated elastomeric copolymers can contain, together with the units deriving from the polymerisation of ethylene and a-olefins, also small proportions of unsaturated units deriving from the copolymerization of one or more polyenes. The content of unsaturated units is preferably comprised between 0 and 5% by weight. Non limitative examples of suitable a-olefins comprise propylene, 1-butene and 4'methyl-l-pentene. Suitable non conjugated diolefins able to cyclopolymerise comprise 1,5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene and 2-methyl-l,5-hexadiene. Non limitative examples of suitable polyenes are: (i)        polyenes able to give unsaturated units, such as:<br>
-	linear, non-conjugated dienes, such as 1,4-hexadiene trans,  1,4-hexadiene cis, 6-methyl-l,5-heptadiene, 3,7-dimethyl-l,6-octadiene and 11-methyl-1,10-dodecadiene;<br>
-	bicyclic diolefins, such as 4,5,8,9-tetrahydroindene and 6 and 7-methyl-4,5,8,9-tetrahydroindene;<br><br>
-	alkenyl or alkyliden norbomenes, such as 5-ethyliden-2-norbomene, 5-isopropyliden-2-norbomene and exo-5-isopropenyl-2-norbomene;<br>
-	polycyclic diolefins, such as dicyclopentadiene, tricyclo-[6.2.1.0^^]4,9-undecadiene and the 4-methyl derivative thereof;<br>
(ii)       non-conjugated diolefins able to cyclopolymerise, such as L5-hexadiene, 1,6-heptadiene and 2-methyl-1,5-hexadiene; (iii)      conjugated dienes, such as butadiene and isoprene. A further interesting use of the catalyst of the present invention is for the preparation of 1-butene<br><br>
homopolymer.<br>
A further interesting use of the catalysts according to the present invention is for the preparation<br>
of cycloolefin   polymers.   Monocyclic   and   polycyclic   olefin   monomers   can   be   either<br>
homopolymerised or copolymerised, also with linear olefin monomers.<br>
Polymerisation processes according to the present invention can be carried out in gaseous phase<br>
or in liquid phase, optionally in the presence of an inert hydrocarbon solvent either aromatic<br>
(such as toluene), or aliphatic (such as propane, hexane, heptane, isobutane and cyclohexane).<br>
The polymerisation temperature generally ranges from about 0°C to about 250°C. In particular,<br>
in the processes for the polymerization of propylene, it is generally comprised between 20°C and<br>
150°C, preferably between 40°C and 90°C.<br>
The polymerization pressure is ranging from 0,5 to 100 bar, preferably from 2 to 50 bar, and<br>
more preferably from 4 to 30 bar.<br>
The molecular weight of the polymers can be also varied merely by varying the polymerization<br>
temperature, the type or the concentration of the catalytic components or by using molecular<br>
weight regulators such as, for example, hydrogen.<br>
The molecular weight distribution can be varied by using mixtures of different metallocenes, or<br>
carrying out the polymerization in several steps at different polymerization temperatures and/or<br>
different concentrations of the molecular weight regulator.<br>
The polymerization yields depend on the purity of the metallocene component of the catalyst.<br>
Therefore, in order to increase the yields of polymerization, metallocenes are generally used after<br>
a purification treatment.<br>
The components of the catalyst can be brought into contact before the polymerization. The pre-<br>
contact concentrations are generally between 1 and 10-8 mol/1 for the metallocene component<br>
(A), while they are generally between 10 and 10-8 mol/1 for the component (B). The pre-contact<br>
is generally effected in the presence of a hydrocarbon solvent and, if appropriate, of small<br>
quantities of monomer. The pre-contact time is generally comprised between 1 minute and 24<br>
hours.<br>

For polymer NMR analyses, the solution 13C-NMR spectra were run at 75.4MHz on a Varian<br>
UNITY-300  NMR  spectrometer.     The  samples  were  nm  as   10%  (w/v)  solutions  in<br>
orthodichlorobenzene-d4 at 130°C. Chemical shifts are referenced to TMS using a secondary<br>
reference, the CH3 methyl peak of polypropylene at 21.8 ppm.    5000 transients were<br>
accumulated for each spectrum with a 10-second delay between pulses.   Decoupling was<br>
always on during acquisition so the nuclear Overhauser enhancement was present.<br>
Solution intrinsic viscosity [n]o of polymer samples were determined in Decalin at 135°C .<br>
The intrinsic viscosities were converted to weight average molecular mass (Mw) by gel<br>
permeation chromatography (GPC) using an empirical correlation of MWand  [η]o for<br>
metallocene     catalyzed     polypropylene     homopolymers     (logioη]o     =    -3.8996     +<br>

For  example  49-56   the  NMR  carbon   spectra  were   acquired  on   a   Bruker  DPX-400<br>
spectrometer operating in the Fourier transform mode at 120 °C at 100.61 MHz. The samples<br>
were dissolved in C2D2Cl4 with a concentration of 8% w/v.<br>
The spectra were acquired with a 90° pulse and 15 seconds of delay between pulses. About<br><br>
1500 (or 3000 for polypropylene and polybutene) transients were stored for each spectrum.<br>
The peak of the PPP methyl carbon or of the CH2 branch for polybutene were used as internal<br>

The apparatus for the supportation of the catalyst consists of two zones. The first zone containing an impregnation column equipped with a mechanical device in which the catalytic solution is continuously fed and that contains the prepolymer to be impregnated and a second zone heated for evaporating the solvent. In the semicontinuous process , after loading the carrier, the catalytic solution is continuously fed to the prepolymer into an impregnation column from which the impregnated prepolymer is pneumatically conveyed through the zone for the evaporation of the solvent and then recirculated again to the first zone after separation from the gas stream by means of a cyclone (described in 'Terry's chemical-engineers' handbook- sixth edition page 18-73) The two zones of the loop reactor are jacketed and maintained at different temperature to optimize the operation that takes place in each zone, impregnation or evaporation. The impregnation column is stirred in order to allow a fast and homogeneous absorption of the catalytic solution. Preparation of catalyst A<br>
40.8 g of PE prepolymer was loaded in the equipment described above and the jacket temperature of the impregnation column and the flashing zone was respectively set to 45 and 90°C. The recirculation of the solid in the loop reactor was initiated by flowing nitrogen through the flashing column. Once the set temperature was reached in the two zones, 20 mL of a lOOg/L MAO solution in toluene (WITCO) was dosed in 15 minutes using a dosing pump. This initial amount of MAO reacts with the residual water present in the support (typically 300-400 ppm) avoiding that the active catalyst is destroyed during supportation. The catalytic solution was prepared under nitrogen by dissolving 173 mg'of C3 in 60 mL of the MAO solution. The bright orange catalytic solution was dosed onto the carrier in 1 hour. The impregnated support was then recirculated for 15 minutes without adding any other components to eliminate the last traces of solvent. The analysis of the discharged supported catalyst is : 5.75% w Al and 470 ppm Zr with an Al/Zr molar ratio of 412. Preparation of catalyst B<br>
43.7 g of PE prepolymer was loaded into the apparatus and the internal temperature raised up to the desired values (the same as for the previous preparation) while recirculating the solid in<br><br>
surface area 1.4 m /g mean pore diameter 1.5µm. Supportation apparatus<br>
The apparatus for the supportation of the catalyst consists of two zones. The first zone containing an impregnation column equipped with a mechanical device in which the catalytic solution is continuously fed and that contains the prepolymer to be impregnated and a second zone heated for evaporating the solvent. In the semicontinuous process , after loading the carrier, the catalytic solution is continuously fed to the prepolymer into an impregnation column from which the impregnated prepolymer is pneumatically conveyed through the zone for the evaporation of the solvent and then recirculated again to the first zone after separation from the gas stream by means of a cyclone (described in -Perry's chemical-engineers' handbook- sixth edition page 18-73) The two zones of the loop reactor are jacketed and maintained at different temperature to optimize the operation that takes place in each zone, impregnation or evaporation. The impregnation column is stirred in order to allow a fast and homogeneous absorption of the catalytic solution. Preparation of catalyst A<br>

43.7 g of PE prepolymer was loaded into the apparatus and the internal temperature raised up to the desired values (the same as for the previous preparation) while recirculating the solid in<br><br>
the loop reactor. Also for this preparation the total amount of MAO solution added to the<br>
carrier was 80 mL, but it was split in 3 consecutive addition steps: first 15 mL to scavenge the<br>
residual water present onto the carrier, then 50 ml in the precontact solution (obtained<br>
dissolving 180 mg of C3) and the last 15 mL of MAO alone after having fed the whole<br>
catalytic solution. The three solutions were dosed to the support in 1.5 hours using a constant<br>
feeding  rate.   Before  discharging  the  supported  catalyst  the  solid  was  maintained  in<br>
recirculation for 15 minutes to completely dry it. The composition of the tlnal catalyst is 6.5%<br>
w Al, 407 ppm Zr with a Al/Zr molar ratio of 538.<br>
