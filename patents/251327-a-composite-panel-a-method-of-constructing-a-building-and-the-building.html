COMPOSITE PRE-FORMED BUILDING PANELS, A BUILDING AND A FRAMING STUD<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS [0001] This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. Nos. 60/656,596 filed February 25, 2005 and 60/664,120 filed March 22, 2005, both entitled ^Composite Pre-Formed Building Panels," which are both herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002]    The present invention is directed to pre-formed<br>
building  panels  that  include  one  or  more  reinforcing<br>
structural elements embedded in a foamed thermoplastic matrix.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
[0003]     It is known to use construction elements made of<br>
expanded plastics, for example expanded polystyrene, in forms<br>
of boards or section members of suitable shape and size.<br>
These members provide thermal and sound insulation functions<br>
and have long been accepted by the building industry,<br>
[0004]     It is also known that, in order to confer adequate<br>
self-supporting properties to such construction elements, one<br>
or more reinforcing section bars of a suitable shape must be<br>
incorporated into the mass of expanded plastics.<br>
[0005]     U.S. Patent Nos. 5,787,665 and 5,822,940 disclose<br>
molded composite wall panels for building construction that<br>
include a regular tetragonal body of polymer foam and at least<br>
one light metal gauge hollow stud in the body.  The edges of<br>
the studs are even with a surface of the polymer foam so<br>
drywall can be attached thereto.<br>
[0006]     U.S.  Patent  6,098,367  discloses  a  constructive<br>
system applied to buildings to form walls by means of modular<br>
foldable frames that allow for the placement of blocks or<br><br>
plates. The frames with the resistant channels, rods, blocks or plates, better resist strong winds and seismic movements. [0007] U.S. Patent No. 6,167,624 discloses a method for producing a polymeric foamed material panel including the steps of providing a polymeric foamed material, cutting the polymeric foamed material until reaching a preconfiguration cut point, cutting subsequently from the preconfiguration cut point a brace-receiving configuration in the polymeric foamed material, and sliding a brace member into the brace-receiving configuration to produce a polymeric foamed material panel. [0008] U.S. Patent -No. 6,235,367 discloses a molded construction product, having one or more walls and an inner core section, including a composition matrix having a resin system, a catalytic agent, and filler compounds for forming the walls; a foam core system for forming the inner core section, a curing agent and a drying agent. A structural reinforcement support system is provided for' reinforcing the structural integrity of the composition. A locking system is provided for joining one or more of the molded products. [0009] EP " 0 459 924 discloses a self-supporting construction element made of expanded plastics material, specifically a floor element, which includes a substantially parallelepipedic central body in which a reinforcing section bar,, made of a thin metal sheet shaped as an "I-beam, is integrated during the molding step.<br>
[0010] U.S. Patent No. 5,333,429 discloses a composite panel with a structural load-bearing wooden framework formed by a substantially parallelepiped body of expanded synthetic material. The panels have a plurality of longitudinal channels extending for the whole height of the panel. A series of channels uniformly spaced and staggered are open on the adjacent face of the panel and have a T-shaped cross section. In these open channels fit T-shaped cross section wooden<br><br>
posts, the stem portion of which emerges out of the open channels and project from the surface of the panel. [00111 WO 2002/035020 discloses a composite construction element that includes a body made of expanded plastics material and a slab-shaped coating element associated to the body. The slab-shaped coating element includes a plurality of substantially adj oining and substantially U-shaped adj acent sections provided with respective means for mechanically clinching the slab-shaped element to the expanded plastics material.<br>
[0012] While the construction elements described above have on the one hand light weight, comparative ease of installation and low cost, on the other hand their application in the art and flexibility of use have been restrained heretofore by their poor fire-resisting properties and/or the propensity for mold to grow on finished surfaces attached thereto.<br>
[0013] This inadequate resistance to fire is essentially related to the fact that construction elements made of expanded plastics show an insufficient capability to securely hold outer covering layers, such as the plaster layers used for the outer surface finish or to contain the expanded polymer body, in flammable molten or liquid form, that occurs from the heat generated from a fire.<br>
[0014] When exposed to fire, in fact, the expanded plastic materials soon shrink into a shapeless mass of reduced volume, which can flow and burn, and in some cases with the ensuing separation of the outer covering layers and rapid collapse of the whole structure.<br>
[0015] In addition, an undesirable separation of the outer covering layers may be caused in some instances by a premature "aging" of the plastics surface to which these coverings adhere, a separation which may be further fostered by exposure<br><br>
to heat sources, dusts, fumes, vapors, or chemical substances coming from a source close to the construction elements. [0016] U.S. Patent 6,298,622 and WO 2004/101905 disclose an approach to overcoming the above-described problem by using a self-supporting construction element of expanded plastics for use as floor elements and walls of buildings- The construction elements include a central body, substantially parallelepipedic in shape and having two opposite faces; at least one reinforcing section bar transversally extending across the central body between the faces thereof and embedded in the expanded plastics; a lath for supporting at least one layer of a suitable covering material, associated to a fin of the reinforcing section bar lying flush with and substantially parallel to at least one of the faces of the construction element. However, moisture buildup between the lath and construction element can lead to mold and mildew growth and the ability to easily run electrical lines without cutting into the construction elements have limited the desirability of this approach.<br>
[0017] Thus there is a need in the art for composite preformed building panels that overcome the above-described problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION [0018]    The present invention provides a composite building panel comprising:<br>
a central body, substantially parallelepipedic in shape, comprising an expanded polymer matrix, having opposite faces, a first surface and an opposing second surface; and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [00167] For the purpose of the description hereinafter, the terms "upper," "lower," *inner", "outer", "right," "left," "vertical," "horizontal," "top," "bottom," and derivatives thereof, shall relate to the invention as oriented in the drawing Figures. However, it is to be understood that the invention may assume alternate variations and step sequences except where expressly specified to the contrary. It is also to be understood that the specific devices and processes, illustrated in the attached drawings and described in the following specification, is an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Hence, specific dimensions and other physical characteristics related to the embodiment disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting the invention. In describing the embodiments of the present invention, reference will be made herein to the drawings in which like numerals refer to like features of the invention.<br>
[00168] Other than where otherwise indicated, all numbers or expressions referring to quantities, distances, or measurements, etc. used in the specification and claims are to be understood as modified in all instances by the term "about." Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties, which the present invention desires to obtain. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the<br><br>
scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. [00169] Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical values, however, inherently contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective measurement methods.<br>
[00170] Also, it should be understood that any numerical range recited herein is intended to include all sub-ranges subsumed therein. For example, a range' of "1 to 10" is intended to include all sub-ranges between and including the recited minimum value of 1 and the recited maximum value of 10; that is, having a minimum value equal to or greater than 1 and a maximum value of equal to or less than 10. Because the disclosed numerical ranges are continuous, they include every value between the minimum and maximum values. Unless expressly indicated otherwise, the various numerical ranges specified in this application are approximations.<br>
[00171] Various embodiments of the present invention provide pre-formed building panels that comprise one or more reinforcing structural elements or members running longitudinally, which may be partially exposed, with the remainder of the reinforcing structural element(s) partially encapsulated in an expanded polymer matrix, which acts as a thermal break. The reinforcing structural elements can be flanged lengthwise on either side to provide attachment points for external obj ects to the panel. Perforations in the reinforcing structural elements which are encapsulated in the expanded polymer matrix allow for fusion perpendicularly. Perforations in the exposed portion of the reinforcing structural  element provide  attachment points  for  lateral<br><br>
bracing and utility installation. In some embodiments, a tongue and groove connection point design provides for panel abutment, weep holes provide for the draining of moisture or the venting of vapors and attachment points for external objects. In some embodiments, recessed areas on opposing panel ends provide an area of member to member connection with *C" channels running along the top and bottom of the structural member. In some embodiments, longitudinal holes can be provided through the expanded polymer matrix to provide areas or channels for the placement of utilities and/or the venting of gasses. Such construction also serves to reduce the overall weight of the panels. The longitudinal holes can be variable in diameter and location. Panel manufacture can be accomplished through the use of a semi-continuous or continuous molding process allowing for variable panel lengths.<br>
[00172] The composite building panels of the present invention will now be discussed in terms of embodiments providing wall units and wall systems. However, one skilled in the art would understand that the composite building panels of the present invention can be used for a variety of uses, for example flooring units, ceiling units, etc., such as will be discussed in detail below. Therefore, the following discussion regarding wall units and wall systems is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention. [00173] As shown in FIG. 1, composite building panel or wall unit 10 according to the present invention comprises a central body 9 comprised of an expanded polymer matrix (expanded polymer body 12).<br>
[00174] As used herein, the term "expandable polymer matrix" refers to a polymeric material in particulate or bead form that can be impregnated with a blowing agent such that when the particulates and/or beads are placed in a mold and heat is applied thereto, evaporation of the blowing agent (as<br><br>
described below) effects the formation of a cellular structure and/or an expanding cellular structure in the particulates and/or beads and the outer surfaces of the particulates and/or beads fuse together to form a continuous mass of polymeric material conforming to the shape of the mold.<br>
[00175] As used herein, the term "polymer" is meant to encompass, without limitation, homopolymers, copolymers and graft copolymers.<br>
[001761 The expanded polymer matrix makes up the expanded polymer body, panels and/or forms described herein below. The expanded polymer matrix is typically molded from expandable thermoplastic particles - These expandable thermoplastic particles are made from any suitable thermoplastic homopolymer or copolymer. Particularly suitable for use are homopolymers derived from vinyl aromatic monomers including styrene, isopropylstyrene, alpha-methylstyrene, nuclear methylstyrenes, chlorostyrene, tert-butylstyrene, and the like, as well as copolymers prepared by the copolymerization of at least one vinyl aromatic monomer as described above with one or more other monomers, non-limiting examples being divinylbenzene, conjugated dienes (non-limiting examples being butadiene, isoprene, 1, 3- and 2,4~ hexadiene), alkyl methacrylates, alkyl acrylates, acrylonitrile, and maleic anhydride, wherein the vinyl aromatic monomer is present in at least 50% by weight of the copolymer. In an embodiment of the invention, styrenic polymers are used, particularly polystyrene. However, other suitable polymers can be used, such as polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene, polypropylene), polycarbonates, polyphenylene oxides, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[00177] As used herein, the terms * (meth) acrylic" and w(meth)acrylate" are meant to include both acrylic and methacrylic acid derivatives, such as the corresponding alkyl esters often referred to as acrylates and (meth)acrylates, which the term xv (meth) acrylate" is meant to encompass.<br><br>
[00178] In various embodiments of the invention, the expandable thermoplastic particles are expandable polystyrene (EPS) particles. These particles can be .in the form of beads, granules, or other particles convenient for the expansion and molding operations. Particles polymerized in an aqueous suspension process are essentially spherical and are useful for molding the expanded polymer body, panels and/or forms described herein below. These particles can be screened so that their size ranges from about 0.008 to about 0.15 inch (0.20 mm to about 3.81 mm)prior to expansion.<br>
[00179] The expandable thermoplastic particles can be impregnated using any conventional method with a suitable blowing agent. As a non-limiting example, the impregnation can be achieved by adding the blowing agent to the aqueous suspension during the polymerization of the polymer, or alternatively by re-suspending the polymer particles in an aqueous medium and then incorporating the blowing agent as taught in U.S. Patent No. 2,983,692. Any gaseous material or material which will produce gases on heating can be used as the blowing agent. Conventional blowing agents include aliphatic hydrocarbons containing 4 to 6 carbon atoms in the molecule, such as butanes, pentanes, hexanes, and the halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. CFC's and HCFC's, which boil at a temperature below the softening point of the polymer chosen. Mixtures of these aliphatic hydrocarbon blowing agents can also be used.<br>
[00180] Alternatively, water can be blended with these aliphatic hydrocarbons blowing agents or water can be used as the sole blowing agent as taught in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,439; 6,160,027; and 6,242,540 in these patents, water-retaining agents are used. The weight percentage of water for use as the blowing agent can range from 1 to 20%. The texts of U.S. Patent Nos. 6,127,439; 6,160,027; and 6,242,540 are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[00181] The impregnated thermoplastic particles are generally pre-expanded to a density of at least 0.1 lb/ft , in some cases at least 0.25 lb/ft3, in other cases at least 0.5 lb/ft3, in some situations at least 0.7 5 lb/ft3, in other situations at least 1 lb/ft3, and in some instances at least about 2 lb/ft3. Also, the density of the impregnated pre-expanded particles can be up to 12 lb/ft3, in some cases up to 10 lb/ft3, and in other cases up to 5 lb/ft3. The density of the impregnated pre-expanded particles can be any value or range between ,any of the values recited above. The pre-expansion step is conventionally carried out by heating the impregnated beads via any conventional heating medium, such as steam, hot air, hot water, or radiant heat. One generally accepted method for accomplishing the pre-expansion of impregnated thermoplastic particles is taught in U.S. Patent No. 3,023,175.<br>
[00182] The impregnated thermoplastic particles can be foamed cellular polymer particles as taught in U.S. Patent Application Pioblication No. 2002/01177 69, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference. The foamed cellular particles can be polystyrene that are pre-expanded and contain a volatile blowing agent at a level of less than 6.0 weight percent, in some cases ranging from about 2.0 wt % to about 5.0 wt %, and in other cases ranging from about 2.5 wt % to about 3.5 wt % based on the weight of the polymer. [00183] An interpolymer of a polyolefin and in situ polymerized vinyl aromatic monomers that can be included in the expandable thermoplastic resin according to various embodiments of the present invention is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,303,756 and 4,303,757 and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0152795, the relevant portions of which are herein incorporated by reference. Non-limiting examples of interpolymers that can be used in the present invention include those available under the trade name<br><br>
ARCEL®, available from NOVA Chemicals Inc., Pittsburgh, PA and PIOCELAN®, available from Sekisui Plastics Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.<br>
[00184] The expanded polymer matrix can include customary ingredients and additives, such as pigments, dyes, colorants, plasticizers, mold release agents, stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers, mold prevention agents, antioxidants, and so on. Typical pigments include, without limitation, inorganic pigments such as carbon black, graphite, expandable graphite, zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, and iron oxide, as well as organic pigments such as quinacridone reds and violets and copper phthalocyanine blues and greens.<br>
[00185] In one embodiment of the invention the pigment is carbon black, a non-limiting example of such a material is EPS SILVER® pigment, available from NOVA Chemicals Inc. [00186] In another embodiment of the invention the pigment is graphite, a non-limiting example of such a material is NEOPOR® pigment, available from BASF Aktiengesellschaft Corp., Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Germany.<br>
[00187] When materials such as carbon black and/or graphite are included in the polymer particles, improved insulating properties, as exemplified by higher R values for materials containing carbon black or graphite (as determined using ASTM - C578), are provided. As such, the R value of the expanded polymer particles containing carbon black and/or graphite or materials made from such polymer particles are at least 5% higher than observed for particles or resulting articles that do not contain carbon black and/or graphite. [00188] The pre-expanded particles or "pre-puff" are heated in a closed mold in the semi-continuous or continuous molding process described below to form the pre-formed building panels according to various embodiments of the present invention.<br><br>
[00189] In. some embodiments, portions of the central body 9 can further comprise materials in addition to the expanded polymer matrix, as nonlimiting examples ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers, heat stabilizers, flame retardants, structural enhancements, biocides, and combinations thereof. [00190] Generally, the central body 9 is substantially parallelepipedic 'in shape, i.e., a polyhedron having six parallelogram faces that are parallel to the opposite face. As shown in FIG. 1, the central body 9 comprises opposite faces, including a first surface or inner surface 30 and an opposing second surface or outer surface 24, a first end 17 and a second end 19, discussed in detail below. [001913 In some embodiments of the invention, outer surface 24 of expanded polymer body 12 can have any desirable type of surface. In some instances, outer surface 24 will be smooth, in other instances grooves can be cut into or molded into outer surface 24 to facilitate the application of finishing surfaces and surface finishing materials such as stucco and the like. In order to facilitate the application of stucco to outer surface 24, T-slots 1300 can be cut into or molded into outer surface 24. Any suitable type of stucco can be used, such as natural material stucco or polymer based stucco. Thus, by including T-slots 1300 in outer surface 24, a stucco ready wall panel surface is provided. More particularly, T-slots 13 provide a mechanical connection for stucco adhesion and no secondary mesh is required. In a particular embodiment of the invention, T-slots 1300 allow for the use of natural material stucco as this type of stucco is able to breathe and not trap water. When stucco is not applied to outer surface 24, T-slots 1300 can be used as water condensation channels for other finishing techniques. [00192] Referring now to FIG. 1, expanded polymer body 12 has a width 32. The expanded polymer body 12 can be manufactured in a variety of different sizes that would<br><br>
facilitate its safe handling and minimal damage during shipping and installation thereof. The width 32 of expanded polymer body 12 may be at least 3*28 feet (1 m), in some cases at least 4.92 feet (1.5 m) , and in other cases at least 6.56 feet (2 m) and can be up to 82.02 feet (25 m) , in some cases up to 65.62 feet (20 m) f in other cases up to 49.21 feet (15 m) , in some instances up to 32.81 feet (10 m) and in other instances up to 16.40 feet (5 m) . The width 32 of expanded polymer body 12 can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br>
[00193] The height 33 of expanded polymer body 12 can be any height that allows for the safe handling and minimal damage to expanded polymer body 12 during shipping and installation. See FIG. 3. In various embodiments, the height • 33 of expanded polymer body 12 is generally determined by the length of embedded metal studs 14 and 16. See also FIG. 1. In various embodiments, the height 33 of expanded polymer body 12 can be at least 3.28 feet (1 m) and in some cases at least 4.92 feet (1.5 m) and can be up to 9.84 feet (3 m) and in some cases up to 8.20 feet (2.5 m) . The height 33 of expanded polymer body 12 can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br>
[00194] Referring now to FIG. 1, expanded polymer body 12 can have a thickness 15, measured as the distance from inner surface 30 to outer surface 24, of at least 0.7 9 inches (2 cm) , in some cases at least one inch (2.5 cm), and in other cases at least 1.18 inches (3 cm) and can be up to 3.94 inches (10 cm), in some cases up to 3.15 inches (8 cm), and in other cases up to 2.36 inches (6 cm) from inner surface 30 of expanded polymer body 12. One skilled in the art will appreciate that the polymer body 12 could be provided in other thicknesses without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br><br>
[00195] In some embodiments, expanded polymer body 12 can comprise one or more openings 18 that traverse all or part of the length and/or width of expanded polymer body 12, for example holes, conduits or chases can be molded into and extend along the length of the expanded polymer body 12. It is conceivable, however, that the expanded polymer body 12 may also be provided without any such openings therethrough. In some embodiments of the present invention, the holes, conduits or chases may be used as access ways for accommodating utilities, such as wiring, plumbing and exhaust vents within the walls, ceilings, floors and roofs constructed according to various embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[00196] Openings 18 can have various cross-sectional shapes, non-limiting examples being round, oval, elliptical, square, rectangular, triangular, hexagonal or octagonal. The cross-sectional size or area of openings 18 can be uniform or they can vary independently of each other with regard to size and location relative to inner surface 30 and outer surface 24. The spacing between each opening 18 can be at least 1.97 inches (5 cm) and in some cases at least 3.94 inches (10 cm) and can be up to 3.61 feet (110 cm), in some cases up to 3.28 ft (100 cm), in other cases up to 2.46 ft (75 cm), and in some instances up to 1.97 ft (60 cm) measured from a midpoint of one opening 18 to a midpoint of an adjacent opening 18. The spacing between openings 18 can independently be any distance or range between any of the distances recited above. [00197] The cross-sectional area of openings 18 can also vary independently one from another or they can be uniform. The cross-sectional area of openings 18 is limited by the dimensions of expanded polymer body 12, as openings 18 will fit within the dimensions of expanded polymer body 18. The cross-sectional area of openings 18 can independently be at least 0.155 in2 (1 cm2), in some cases at least 0.775 in2 (5 cm2), and in other cases at least 1.395 in2 (9 cm2) and can be<br><br>
up to 20.15 in2 (130 cm2), in some cases up to 15.50 in2 (100 cm2), in other cases up to 11.625 in2 (75 cm2). The cross-sectional area of openings 18 can independently be any value or range between any of the values recited above, [00198] Referring now to FIG. 4, in other embodiments of the invention, the wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels or central body have a first end 17, such as a male ^tongue" end or edge, and a second end 19, such as for example a female '"groove" end or edge, that facilitates a ^tongue and groove" union of two matching wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels. The tongue and groove union can be non-linear and can provide for a weep hole and/or larger opening to accommodate plumbing lines. Typically the tongue and groove union provides a flat surface at the union to allow for easy application of sealing tape to seal the union or joint if desired.<br>
[00199] Various embodiments of the present invention further include reinforcing members to provide strength, rigidity to the panel and to generally enhance the panelrs structural integrity to thereby enable the panel to withstand the anticipated loads and stresses that it will likely encounter when installed. The reinforcing members employed in various embodiments of the present invention may comprise a variety of different structural members, bars, joists, studs and other structural profiles without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. FIG. 1 illustrates the use of reinforcing members in the form of conventional metal studs 14 and 16. As can be seen in that Figure, the metal studs 14 and 16 are spaced from each other across the width 32 of the central body 9 and extend longitudinally therein as illustrated in FIG. 3. As shown in FIG. 1, in one embodiment wall unit 10 comprises a left facing embedded metal stud 14, and right facing embedded metal stud 16. One skilled in the art would understand that in alternative embodiments a<br><br>
single reinforcing member or more than two reinforcing members can be used as desired.<br>
[00200] The reinforcing members used in various embodiments of the invention can be made of any suitable material.

Spacer bars and metal studs that can be incorporated in the invention include those available under the trademarks TRADE READY® SPAZZER® available from Dietrich Industries, Inc., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as well as those disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5/784/850, 6,021,618 and 6,708,460, the relevant portions of which are herein incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, SPAZZER® bar Model No. 5400 is used. Retainer clips such as SPAZZER® BAR GUARD** retainer clips, also available from " Dietrich Industries, Inc;, can be used for load . bearing applications, if desired.<br>
[00299] The various metal structural parts in wall system 21 can be secured or attached to one another by way of welds 71 and/or screws 73. It is conceivable, however, that other forms of mechanical fasteners may also be employed without departing form the spirit and scope of the present invention. [00300] Some advantages of the present wall units and wall systems include the ability to easily run utilities prior to attaching a finish surface to the exposed ends of the embedded metal studs. The exposed metal studs facilitate field structural framing changes and additions and leave the structural portions of the assembly exposed for local building officials to inspect the framing.<br><br>
[00301] Referring to FIG. 109, in an embodiment of the invention, wall unit 10 includes expanded polymer body 12 (central body), right facing embedded metal studs 16, which include flanges 11 and have utility' holes 46 located in an exposed portion of embedded studs 16, expansion holes 13 in an embedded portion (thermal portion) of embedded studs 16 and embedded end 22, which does not touch outer surface 24 of expanded polymer body 12. The embedded metal studs 16 also have exposed end 28 (structural portion) respectively that extends from inner surface 30 of expanded polymer body 12, While Otype embedded studs are illustrated in FIG. 109, this is not to be construed as limiting the present invention as the use of other types of studs, such as CC-type embedded studs and CT-type embedded studs, may be successfully employed in similar manners.<br>
[00302] A utility space defined by inner surface 30 of expanded polymer body 12 and flanges 11 adapted for running utilities is provided. Flanges 11 may have a finish surface or material attached to them, a side of which further defines the utility space.<br>
[00303] In an embodiment of the invention, the utility space may be adapted and dimensioned to receive a variety of commercially available standard and/or pre-manufactured components, such as windows, doors and medicine cabinets as well as customized cabinets, shelving, etc.<br>
[00304] In an embodiment of the invention, utility holes 4 6 may be adapted to allow utilities (as shown, electrical line 15) to be installed in a transverse direction through embedded studs 16.<br>
[00305]    The utilities can be one or more selected from water lines (either potable, or as a non-limiting example hot water  lines  for  radiant  heating) ,  waste  lines,  chases, telephone lines, cable television lines, computer lines, fiber<br><br>
optic cables, satellite dish communication lines, antenna lines, electrical lines, ductwork, gas lines, etc. [00306] In a particular embodiment of the invention, wall unit 10 is attached*to bottom track' 44- In this embodiment, bottom track 44 is adapted to hold a volume at least equivalent to the volume of the expanded polymer matrix in expanded polymer body 12, in liquid or molten form. In some instances, this volume can be defined by bottom 101 and sides 103 of bottom track 44 and the portions of embedded bars 16 within the space defined by bottom track 44.<br>
[00307]     Non-limiting examples of suitable finish surfaces include wood, rigid plastics, wood paneling, concrete panels, cement panels,  drywall,  sheetrock,  particle board,  rigid plastic panels, a metal lath, or any other suitable material having decorating and/or structural functions.<br>
[00308] Further, the air space between the inner surface of the expanded polymer body and the finish surface allows for improved air circulation, which can minimize or prevent mildew. Additionally, because the metal studs are not in direct contact with the outer surface, thermal bridging via the highly conductive embedded metal studs is' avoided and insulation properties are improved.<br>
[00309] ■ The present invention also provides composite building panels useful for floor units and floor systems. As shown in FIG. 110, floor unit 90 includes expandable polymer panel 92 (central body) and embedded metal joists 94 and 96 (embedded framing studs). Expandable polymer panel 92 A includes openings 98 that traverse all or part of the length of expanded polymer panel 92 (as described regarding openings 18 in expanded polymer body 12) . The embedded metal joists 94 and 96 have embedded ends 104 and 106, respectively, that are in contact with top surface 102 of expanded polymer panel 92. The embedded metal joists 94 and 96 also have exposed ends 108<br><br>
and 110, respectively, that extend from bottom surface 100 of expanded polymer panel 92.<br>

The space defined by bottom surface 100 of expanded polymer panel 92 and the exposed ends 108 and 110 and second transverse members 128 and 129 of embedded metal joists 94 arid 96 can be oriented to accept ductwork or other members placed between embedded metal joists 94 and 96 adjacent bottom surface 100.<br>
[00311]    Expanded polymer panel 92 can have a thickness, measured as the distance from top surface 102 to bottom surface 100 similar in dimensions to that described above regarding expanded polymer body 12. See FIG. 110. [00312]     Exposed ends 108 and 110 extend at least 1, in some cases at least 2, and in other cases at least 1.18 inches (3 cm) away from bottom surface 100 of expanded polymer panel 92.  Also, exposed ends 108 and 110 can extend up to 60, in some cases up to 40, and in other cases up to 7.87 in (20 cm) away from bottom surface 100 of expanded polymer panel 92. Exposed ends 108 and 110 can extend any of the distances or can range between any of the distances recited above from bottom surface 100.<br>
[00313] In an embodiment of the invention, embedded metal joists 94 and 96 have a cross-sectional shape that includes embedding lengths 114 and 116, embedded ends 104 and 106, and exposed ends . 108 and 110. The orientation of embedded metal joists 94 and 96 is referenced by the direction of open ends 118 and 120. In an embodiment of the invention, open ends 118 and 120 are oriented toward each other.  In this embodiment,<br><br>
floor unit 90 is adapted to accept ductwork. As a non-limiting example, a HVAC duct can be installed along the length of embedded metal joists 94 and 96.<br>
[00314] As used herein, the term' "ductwork" refers to any tube, pipe, channel or other enclosure through which air can flow from a source to a receiving space; non-limiting examples being air flowing from heating and/or air-conditioning equipment to a room, make-up air flowing from a room to heating and/or air-conditioning equipment, fresh air flowing to an enclosed space, and/or waste air flowing from an enclosed space to a location outside of the enclosed space.

[00316] Openings 98 can have various cross-sectional shapes and similar spacing and cross-sectional area as described regarding openings 18 in expanded polymer body 12. [00317] As shown in FIG. 110, expanded polymer panel 92 can extend for a distance with alternating embedded metal joists 94 and 96 placed therein. The length of floor unit 90 can be any length that allows for safe handling and minimal damage to floor unit 90 as described regarding the length of wall unit 10. In some embodiments, an end of floor unit 90 can be terminated with an embedded metal joist. [00318] As shown in FIG. 110, expanded ' polymer panel 12 has a finite length and has a male terminal end 91 that includes forward edge 93 and trailing edge 95 and a receiving end 97 which includes recessed section 99 and extended section 101, which is adapted to receive forward edge 93, and trailing edge 95. Typically, lengths of floor units 90 are interconnected by inserting a forward edge 93 from a first<br><br>
floor unit 90 into a recessed section 99 from a second floor unit 90. In this manner, a larger floor section containing any number of floor units can be assembled and/or arrayed. [00319] The width of floor unit 90 can be any width that allows for safe handling and minimal damage to floor unit 90. The width of floor unit 90 may be determined by the length of embedded metal joists 94 and 96. The width of floor unit 90 can be at least 1 and in some cases at least 4,92 feet (1.5 m) and can be up to 9.84 feet (3 m) and in some cases up to 8.20 feet {2.5 m). In some instances, in order to add stability to floor unit 90, reinforcing cross-members (not shown) . can be attached to embedded metal joists 94 and 96. The width of floor unit 90 can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br>
[00320] Floor unit 90 may comprise a typically part of an overall floor system, which may include, for example, a plurality of composite floor panels as described herein, ductwork attached to the reinforcing members of at least one floor panel, and a flooring material attached to one or more of the' first transverse members of the composite floor panels. [00321] The floor panels interconnect with the male ends, which include a forward edge or tongue edge, and the female ends, which include a groove or recessed section, arrayed such that the tongue (male) and/or groove (female) of each panel is in sufficient contact with a corresponding tongue and/or groove of another panel to form a structure having a planar surface.<br>
[00322] In the present floor system, ductwork can be attached to the reinforcing members of at least one composite floor panel.<br>
[00323] Additionally, a flooring material can be attached to one or more of the first transverse members of the composite floor panels. Any suitable flooring material can be used in the  invention.    Suitable flooring materials  are<br><br>
materials that can be attached to the transverse members and cover at least a portion of the expanded polymer panel. Suitable flooring materials may include, but are not limited to, plywood,  wood planks, ' tongue and grooved wood floor sections, sheet metal, sheets of structural plastics, stone, ceramic, cement, concrete, and combinations thereof. [00324]     Generally, the floor system forms a plane that extends laterally from a foundation and/or a structural wall. [00325]     FIGS. 12 6A and 126B show floor system components 140 and 141 respectively.  As shown in FIGS. 126A and 126B, the floor system is established by contacting forward edge 93 with recessed section 99 to- form a continuous floor 142.  Like features  of the individual  floor panels are  labeled as indicated above.  As described above, various shaped types of ductwork can be secured in the space defined by bottom surface 100 of expanded polymer panel 92 and the exposed ends 108 and 110 and second transverse members 128 and 129 of embedded metal joists 94 and 96.  As non-limiting examples, rectangular ventilation duct 147 is shown in FIG. 126A and oval air duct 148 is shown in FIG. 126B.<br>
[00326] The composite building panels, wall units, floor units, tilt up insulated panels and I-beam panels described herein contain variations that are not meant as limitations. Any of the variations discussed in one embodiment can be used in another embodiment without limitation.<br>
[00327] The embodiments of the invention shown in FIGS. 12 6A and 12 6B show a non-limiting example of combinations of the composite panels described herein combining features of the various panels. This embodiment combines I-beam panel 14 0 and floor panel 90 (shown as 92 and 92A) . In this embodiment, receiving end 176 of I-beam panel 140 accepts forward edge 93 of floor panel 92 and recessed section 99 of floor panel 92A accepts forward edge 172 of I-beam panel 140 to provide tongue and groove connections to establish continuous floor system<br><br>
141- In this embodiment, circular ductwork 148 is installed along bottom surface 100 of floor panel 92 between embedded metal joists 94 and 96. In this embodiment, the flooring material is concrete layer 145, which covers top surface 102 of floor panels 92 and 92A and outer face 162 of I-beam panel 140. I-beam channel 182 extends from and is open to outer face 162 and is filled with concrete and the thickness of concrete layer 145 is sufficient to encase exposed ends 158 and 160 of I-beam panel 140. The combination shown in this embodiment provides an insulated concrete floor system where utilities can be run under an insulation layer. [00328] As shown in FIG, 112, an end of embedded metal joists 94 and 96 are seated in and attached to a joist rim 122 and a second joist rim is attached to the other end of embedded metal joists 94 and 96. A floor base 149, typically plywood, particle board or other supporting surface or flooring material, can be attached to the exposed ends 108 and 110. Alternatively, floor base 149 can be attached to embedded ends 104 and 106.<br>
[00329] Referring now to FIGS. 114 and 115, a first wall unit 10 with a first end and a second end is positioned with the first end adjacent to a surface and the second end positioned in a level track 128. A joist rim 122 of a floor system is fixedly connected to the level track 128. In various embodiments, the joist rims manufactured by Dietrich Industries of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under the trademark TRADE READY® may be employed. A plurality of metal joists 94 are attached to the joist rim 122 and support a floor base 149. A bottom track 44 is also provided in connection with joist rim 122 opposite to level track 128. A second wall unit 10' with a first end and a second is positioned with the first end in the bottom track 44, When the first and second wall units 10, 10' are constructed in this manner, a gap 117 between the expanded polymer body 12 of the first wall unit 10<br><br>
and the expanded polymer body 12' of the second wall unit is created- This gap 117 can be filled with any suitable material 115, such as insulation. The material 115 may be secured to the structure using an adhesive, nails, screws or any other suitable securing method.<br>
[00330] In this manner, a multi-story structure can be constructed using the building panels of the present invention.<br>
[00331]     Referring back to FIG. 112, embedded metal joists 94 and 96 have utility holes 127 spaced along their length. Utility  holes  127  are  useful  for  running  wiring  for electricity, telephone, cable television, speakers, and other electronic devices.  Utility holes 127 can have various cross-sectional shapes, non-limiting examples being round, oval, elliptical,  s quare,  rectangular,  triangular,  hexagonal  or octagonal.  The cross-sectional area of Utility holes 127 can also vary independently one from another or they can be uniform.  The cross-sectional area of utility holes 127 is limited by the dimensions of embedded metal joists 94 and 96, as utility holes 127 will fit within their dimensions and not significantly detract from their structural integrity and strength.<br>
[00332] Expansion holes 13, as mentioned above are useful in that as expanded polymer body 92 is molded, the polymer matrix expands through expansion holes 113 and the expanding polymer fuses. This allows the polymer matrix to encase and hold embedded studs 94 and 96 by way of the fusion in the expanding polymer.. In an embodiment of the invention, expansion holes 13 can have a flanged and in many cases a rolled flange surface to provided added strength to the embedded metal studs.<br>
[00333] In an embodiment of the invention, the floor system can be placed on a foundation. However, because foundations are rarely perfectly level, a level track 128 can<br><br>
be attached to foundation 130 prior to placement of the floor system (see FIGS. 112 and 113). Level track 128 can be placed on foundation 128 and leveled utilizing conventional techniques. The level is made permanent by fastening level track 128 to foundation 130 by using fasteners 131 (nails shown, although screws or other suitable devices can be used) via fastening holes 132* Screws 133 can also be used to attach level track 128 to foundation 130 via screw holes 135. Screws 133 can also maintain the level position of level track 128 until a more permanent positioning is achieved. Alternatively or additionally mortar can be applied via mortar holes 134 to fill the space between level track 128 and the top of foundation 130. After level track 128 has been attached and/or the mortar has sufficiently set, the flooring system can be fastened to the foundation.<br>
[00334] In various embodiments, level track 128 includes side rails 137, which are adapted to extend over a portion of foundation 130. The width of level track 128 is the transverse distance of a top portion of level track 128 from one side rail 137 to the other. The width of level track 128 is typically slightly larger than the width of foundation 130. The width of level track 128 can be at least 3.94 inches (10 cm), in some cases at least 5.90 inches (15 cm) , in other cases at least 7.87 in (20 cm) and in some instances at least 8.27 in (21 cm). Also, the width of level track 128 can be up to 15.748 in (40 cm), in some cases up to 13.78 in (35 cm), and in other cases up to 11.81 in (30 cm). The width of level track 128 can be any value or range between any of the values recited above.<br>
[00335] The length of side rail 137 is the distance it extends from the top portion of level track 128 and is sufficient in length to allow for proper leveling of level track 128 and attachment to foundation 130 via fasteners 131 and fastening holes 132.  The length of side rail 137 can be<br><br>
at least 1.58 inches (4 cm), in some cases at least 1.97 inches (5 cm), and in other cases at least 2.76 inches (7 cm). Also, the length of side rail 137 can be up to 7.87 in (20 cm), in some cases up to 5.90 inches (15 cm), and in other cases up to 4.72 inches (12 cm). The length of side rail 137 can be any value or range between any of the values recited above.<br>

The embedded metal members 144 and 146 also have exposed ends 158 and 160, respectively, that extend from outer face 162 of expanded polymer form 142. [00337] Expanded polymer form 142 can have a thickness, measured as the distance from inner face 150 to outer face 162 of at least 8, in some cases at least 10, and in other cases at least 4.72 inches (12 cm) and- can be up to 100, in some cases up to 7 5, and in other cases up to 1.97 ft (60 cm). The thickness of expanded polymer form 142 can be any distance or can range between any of the distances recited above. [00338] Exposed ends 158 and 160 extend at least 1, in some cases at least 2, and in other cases at least 1.18 inches (3 cm) away from outer face 162 of expanded polymer form 142. Also, exposed ends 158 and 160 can extend up to 60, in some cases up to 40, and in other cases up to 7.87 in (20 cm) away from outer face 162 of expanded polymer form 142. Exposed ends 158 and 160 can extend any of the distances or can range<br><br>
between any of the distances recited above from outer face 100.<br>
[00339] In an embodiment of the invention, embedded metal members 144 and 14 6 have a cross-sectional shape that includes embedding lengths 164 and 166, embedded ends 152 and 156, and exposed ends 158 and 160. The orientation of embedded metal members 144 and 146 is referenced by the direction of open ends 168 and 170. In an embodiment of the invention, open ends 168 and 170 are oriented toward each other. In this embodiment, I-beam panel 140 is adapted to be embedded in the concrete that is applied to outer face 162'.<br>
[00340] The spacing between each of embedded metal members 144 and 14 6 can be as described regarding embedded metal studs 14 and 16 in wall unit 10.<br>
[00341] Openings 148 can have various cross-sectional shapes and similar spacing and cross-sectional area as described regarding openings 18 in expanded polymer body 12. [00342] As shown in FIG. Ill, expanded polymer panel 140 has a finite length and has a male terminal end 170 that includes forward edge 172 and trailing edge 174 and a receiving end 176 which includes recessed section 178, which is adapted to receive forward edge 172, and protruding edge 180. Typically, lengths of I-beam panels 140 are interconnected by inserting a forward edge 172 from a first I-beam panel 140 into a recessed section 178 of a second I-beam panel. In this manner, a larger roof or wall section containing any number of I-beam panels can be assembled and/or arrayed. The width of I-beam panel 140, measured as the distance from protruding edge 18 0 to trailing edge 174 can typically be at least 20, in some cases at least 30, and in other cases at least 13.78 in (35 cm) and can be up to 150, in some cases up to 135, and in other cases up to 4.10 ft (125 cm) . The width of I-beam panel 140 can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br><br>
[00343]    As can also be seen in FIG. Ill, I-beam panel 140<br>
includes I-beam channel 182. Various forms of the present I-beam panel are advantageous when compared to prior art systems in that the connection between adjacent panels in the prior art is provided along the thin section of expanded polymer below I-beam channel 182. The resulting thin edge of those prior panels is prone to damage and/or breakage during shipment and handling. The I-beam panel of the present invention eliminates this problem by providing a connection between adjacent panels at ends 170 and 176. Therefore, when the I-beam channel 182 is molded with concrete or the like, damage resulting from the concrete seeping through a gap created by the connection is eliminated.<br>
[00344] In an embodiment of the invention, rebar or other concrete reinforcing rods can be. placed in I-beam channel 182 in order to strengthen and reinforce a concrete I-beam formed within I-beam channel 182.<br>
[00345] In another embodiment of the invention shown in FIG. 116, instead of I-beam channel 182, I-beam panel 141 includes channel 183. Channel 183 is adapted to accept ductwork or other mechanical and utility parts, devices and members.<br>
[00346] An example of an I-beam system 200 according to various embodiments of the present invention is shown in FIG. 117, where four I-beam panels 14 0 are connected by inserting a forward edge 172 from a first I-beam panel 140 into a recessed section 178 of a second I-beam panel. • Concrete is poured, finished and set to form a concrete layer 202 that includes concrete I-beams 204, which are formed in I-beam channels 182. The embodiment shown in FIG. 117 is an alternating embodiment, where the direction of I-beam channel 182 of each I-beam panel 140 alternately faces toward concrete layer 202 and includes concrete I-beam 204 or faces away from concrete layer 202 and I-beam channel  182  does  not  contain  concrete.    In  an<br><br>
embodiment of the invention, the facing away I-beam panel can be I-beam panel 141.  Alternatively, every I-beam panel 140 could face concrete layer 202 and include concrete I-beam 204. [00347]     In the embodiment shown in FIG. 117, exposed ends 158 and 160 are either embedded in concrete layer 202 or are exposed.   The exposed ends 158 and 160 are available as attachment points for a finish surface such as wood, rigid plastics,  wood paneling,  concrete panels,  cement panels, drywall, sheetrock, particle board, rigid plastic panels, or any  other  suitable  material  having  decorating  and/or structural functions or other construction substrates 210. The attachment is typically accomplished through the use of screws or other suitable fastener arrangements. [00348]     In various embodiments of the invention, I-beam system 200 is assembled on a flat surface and a first end is lifted while a second end remains stationary resulting in orienting I-beam system 200 generally perpendicular to the flat surface.  This is often referred to as ^tilting a wall" in the art and in this embodiment of the invention, I-beam system 200 is referred to as a v%tilt-wall."<br>
[00349] In another embodiment of the invention, I-beam system 200 can be used as a roof on a structure. [00350] An embodiment of the invention relates to a tilt up insulated panel that is adapted for use as a wall or ceiling panel. As shown in FIGS. 118-121, one-sided wall panel 340 includes a reinforced body 341 that includes expanded polymer form 342 (central body) and embedded metal members 344 and 346 (embedded reinforcing bars). Expanded polymer form 342 can include openings 348 and utility chases 349, which traverse all or part of the length of expanded polymer form 342. The embedded metal members 344 and 346 have embedded ends 352 and 356, respectively, that are not in contact with inner face 350 of expanded polymer form 342. The embedded metal members 344 and 346 also have exposed ends 358<br><br>
and 360, respectively, that extend from outer face 362 of expanded polymer form 342.<br>
[00351] Expanded polymer form 342 can have a thickness similar to that described regarding expanded polymer form 142. Exposed ends 358 and 360 extend at least 0.39 in (1 cm), in some cases at least 0.79 inches (2 cm), and in other cases at least 1.18 inches (3 cm) away from outer face 362 of expanded polymer form 342. Also, Exposed ends 358 and 360 can extend up to 2.36 in (60 cm), in some cases up to 15.748 in (40 cm), and in other cases up to 7.87 in (20 cm) away from outer face 362 of expanded polymer form 342. . Exposed ends 358 and 360 can extend any of the distances or can range between any of the distances recited above from outer face 362. [00352] In an embodiment of the invention, embedded metal members '344 and 346 have a cross-sectional shape that includes embedding lengths 364 and 366, embedded ends 352 and 356, and exposed ends 358 and 360. The orientation of embedded metal members 344 and 346 is referenced by the direction of embedded ends 352 and 356. In a particular embodiment of the invention, embedded ends 352 and 356 are oriented away from each other. In this embodiment, one-sided wall panel 34 0 is adapted so that exposed ends 358 and 360 of embedded metal members. 344 and 346 . are embedded in concrete 370 that is applied to outer face 362.<br>
[00353] The spacing between each of embedded metal members 344 and 346 can be as described regarding embedded metal studs 14 and 16 in wall unit 10.<br>
[00354] Referring now to FIGS. 118 and 120, in an embodiment of the invention, one-sided wall panel 340 includes expanded polymer body 342 (central body), embedded metal members 344 and 346 (embedded framing studs), which include flanges 311, cornered ends 312, utility holes 346 located in an exposed portion of embedded metal members 344 and 34 6, expansion holes 313 in an embedded portion of embedded metal<br><br>
members 344 and 346, and embedded ends 344 and 346, which do not touch inner face 350.<br>
[00355] In an embodiment of the invention, inner face 350 can have a corrugated surface, which can be molded in or cut in, which enhances air flow between inner face 350 and any surface attached thereto.<br>
[00356] With continuing reference to FIGS. 118 and 120, expansion holes 313 are useful in that as expanded polymer body 342 is molded, the polymer matrix expands through expansion holes 313 and the expanding polymer fuses. This allows the polymer matrix to encase and hold embedded metal members 344 and 346 by way of fusion in the expanding polymer. In an embodiment of the invention, expansion holes 313 can have a flanged and in many cases a rolled flange surface to provided added strength to the embedded metal members. [00357] Openings 348 can have various cross-sectional shapes and similar spacing and cross-sectional area as described regarding openings 18 in expanded polymer body 12. [00358] Referring now to FIG. 118 and 119, reinforced body 341 has a finite length and has a male terminal end 371 that includes forward edge 372 and a receiving end 37 6 which includes recessed section 37 6, which is adapted to receive forward edge 372. Typically, lengths of one-sided wall panel 340 are interconnected by inserting a forward edge 372 from a first one-sided wall panel 34 0 into a recessed section 378 of a second one-sided wall panel. In this manner, a larger wall or ceiling section containing any number of one-sided wall panels can be assembled and/or arrayed. The width of onesided wall panel 34 0, measured as the distance from protruding edge 380 to trailing edge 374 can typically be at least 20, in some cases at least 30, and in other cases at least 13.78 in (35 cm) and can be up to 150, in some cases up to 135, and in other cases up to 4.10 ft (125 cm) .  The width of one-sided<br><br>
wall panel 340 can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above.<br>
[00359] An example of a one-sided wall panel 340 according to various embodiments of the present invention is shown in FIG. 118f where four embedded metal members 344 and 346 are used. Concrete is poured, finished and set to form a concrete layer 370 that encases exposed ends 358 and 360 of embedded metal members 344 and 34 6.<br>
[00360] The embedded ends 350 and 356 of embedded metal members 344 and 34 6 are available as attachment points for a finish surface such as wood, ' rigid plastics, wood paneling, concrete panels, cement panels, drywall, sheetrock, particle board, rigid plastic panels, or any other suitable material having decorating and/or structural functions or other construction substrates sheetrock 375 as shown in FIG. 118. The attachment is typically accomplished through the use of screws or other suitable fastener arrangements. [00361] Another embodiment of the invention is shown in FIG. 121. In this embodiment, reinforcement mesh 371 is attached to exposed ends 358 and' 360 of embedded metal members 344 and 34 6. • Reinforcement mesh 371 can be made of any suitable material, non-limiting examples being fiberglass, metals such as steel, stainless steel and aluminum, plastics, synthetic fibers and combinations thereof. Desirably, after reinforcement mesh 371 is attached to exposed ends 358 and 360, concrete layer 37 0 is poured, finished and set so as to encase reinforcement mesh 371 and exposed ends 358 and 360. In this embodiment, reinforcement mesh 371 increases the strength of concrete layer 370 as well as increasing the strength of the attachment of concrete layer 370 to reinforced body 341.<br>
[00362] In an embodiment of the invention, one-sided wall panel 340 is assembled on a flat surface and a first end is lifted while a second end remains stationary resulting in<br><br>
orienting one-sided wall panel 340 generally perpendicular to the flat surface. This is often referred to as "tilting a wall" in the art and in this embodiment of the invention, onesided wall panel 340 is referred to as a "tilt-up wall." [00363] An embodiment of the invention relates to another tilt up insulated panel that is adapted for use as a wall or ceiling panel. As shown in FIGS. 122-125, two-sided wall panel 440 includes a reinforced body 441 that includes expanded polymer form 442 (central body) and embedded metal members 444 and 446 (embedded reinforcing bars) . Expanded polymer form 442 can include openings 448 that traverse all or part of the length of expanded polymer form 442. The embedded metal members 444 and 446 have a first exposed end 452 and second exposed end 456 respectively that extend from first face 462 of expanded polymer form 442. The embedded metal members 444 and 446 also have second exposed ends 458 and 460 respectively that extend from second face 450 of expanded polymer form 442.<br>
[00364]     Expanded polymer form 442 can have a thickness, measured as the distance from second face 450 to first face 4 62 similar to that described regarding expanded polymer form 142.<br>
[00365] The exposed ends can extend at least 1, in some cases at least 2, and in other cases at least 1.18 inches (3 cm) away either face 450 or face 4 62 of expanded polymer form 442. Also, the exposed ends can extend up to 60, in some cases up to 40, and in other cases up to 7.87 in (20 cm) away from either face of expanded polymer form 442. The exposed ends can extend any of the distances or can range between any of the distances recited above from either face of expanded polymer form 442.<br>
[00366] In an embodiment of the invention, exposed ends 4 52, 456, 458, and 4 60 are embedded in first concrete layer<br><br>
469 and second concrete layer 470 that are applied to faces 450 and 462.<br>
[00367] The spacing between each of embedded metal members 444 and 446 can be as described regarding embedded metal studs 14 and 16 in wall unit 10.<br>
[00368] In an embodiment of the invention, two-sided wall panel 440 includes expanded polymer body 442 (central body), embedded metal members 444 and 446 (embedded framing studs), which cornered ends 412, utility holes 44 6 located in an exposed portion of embedded metal members 444 and 44 6, and expansion holes 413 in an embedded portion of embedded metal members 444 and 446.<br>
[00369] Expansion holes 413 are useful in that, as expanded polymer body 442 is molded, the polymer matrix expands through expansion holes 413 and the expanding polymer fuses. This allows the polymer matrix to encase and hold embedded metal members 444 and 446 by way of fusion in the expanding polymer. In an embodiment of the invention, expansion holes 413 can have a flanged' portion around their respective perimeters and in many cases a rolled flange surface to reinforce the area around the holes, [00370] Openings 448 can have, various cross-sectional shapes and similar spacing and cross-sectional area as described regarding openings 18 in expanded polymer body 12. [00371] Reinforced body 441 has a finite length and has a male terminal end 471 that includes forward edge 472 and a receiving end 476 which includes recessed section 478, which is adapted to receive forward edge 472. Typically, lengths of two-sided wall panel 440 are interconnected by inserting a forward edge 472 from a first two-sided wall panel 440 into a recessed section 478 of a second two-sided wall panel. In this manner, a larger wall or ceiling section containing any number of two-sided wall panels can be assembled and/or arrayed.  The width of one-sided wall panel 440, measured as<br><br>
the distance from forward edge 472 to recessed section 478 can typically be at least 20, in some cases at least 30, and in other cases at least 13.78 in (35 cm) and can be up to 150, in some cases up to 135, and in other cases up to 4.10 ft (125 cm) . The width of two-sided wall panel 440 can be any value or can range between any of the values recited above. [00372] An example of a two-sided wall panel 440 according to various embodiments of the present invention is shown in FIG. 122, where four embedded metal members 444 and 44 6 are used. Concrete is poured, finished and set to form concrete layers 469 and 470 that encases exposed ends 452, 456, 458, and 4 60 of the embedded metal members.<br>
[00373] Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 125, a two-sided wall panel 439 includes variations of two-sided wall panel 440. In two-sided wall panel 439 one (or alternatively both, which is not shown) of exposed ends 452 and 456 (and alternatively also 458 and 460) are available as attachment points for a finish surface 47 5 such as wood, rigid plastics, wood paneling, concrete panels, cement panels, drywall, sheetrock, particle board, rigid plastic panels, or any other suitable material having decorating and/or structural functions or other construction substrates. The attachment is typically accomplished through the use of screws. However, other suitable fastener arrangements may be employed. In this embodiment, the space 476 defined by the finished surface, the exposed ends 444 and 446 and the expanded polymer body 442 can be used to run utilities, insulation and anchors for interior finishes as described above.<br>
[00374] In this alternative embodiment, reinforcement mesh 471 is attached to exposed ends 458 and 4 60 of embedded metal members 444 and 446. Reinforcement mesh 471 can be made of any suitable material, non-limiting examples being fiberglass, metals such as steel, stainless steel and aluminum, plastics, synthetic fibers and combinations thereof.  Desirably, after<br><br>
reinforcement mesh 471 is attached to exposed ends 458 and 460, concrete layer 470 is poured, finished and set so as to encase reinforcement mesh 471 and exposed ends 458 and 4 60. In this embodiment, reinforcement mesh 471 increases the strength of concrete layer 470 as well as increasing the strength of the attachment of concrete layer 470 to reinforced body 441.<br>
[00375] In another embodiment of the. invention, two-sided wall panel 440 is assembled on a flat surface and a first end is lifted while a second end remains stationary resulting in orienting two-sided wall panel 440 generally perpendicular to the flat surface. This is often referred to as "tilting a wall" in the art and in this embodiment of the invention, two-sided wall panel 440 is referred to as a "tilt-up wall." [00376] In embodiments of the tilt-up walls described herein, the exposed ends of the embedded metal members can act as a chair for the proper placement of reinforcing wire mesh and/or rebar or other reinforcing rods to the center of a concrete layer, poured, finished and set to encase the exposed ends.<br>
[00377] As used herein, the term . "concrete" refers to a hard strong building material made by mixing a cementitous mixture with sufficient water to cause the cementitous mixture to set and bind the entire mass as is known in the art. [00378] In an embodiment of the invention, the concrete can be a so called "light weight concrete" in which light weight aggregate is included with the cementitous mixture. Exemplary light weight concrete compositions that can be used in the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,021,291, 3,214,393, 3,257,338, 3,272,7 65, 5,622,556, 5,725,652, 5,580,378, and 6,851,235, JP 9 071 449, WO 98 02 397, WO 00/61519, and WO 01/66485 the relevant" portions of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
[00379] In an embodiment of the invention, when the exposed ends of the one-sided wall panel and the two sided wall panel are encased in concrete as described above, utility holes 346 and 446 act as sites where the set and hardened concrete fuses through the holes and thereby holds and attaches to the embedded metal members. Additionally, reinforcing rods can be placed through utility holes 34 6 and 446 connecting embedded metal members, thus further strengthening the formed wall panel.<br>
[00380] The wall units, floor units, tilt up insulated panels and I-beam panels described herein contain variations that are not meant as limitations- Any of the variations discussed in one embodiment can be used in another embodiment without limitation.<br>
[00381] In an embodiment of the invention, a lath can be attached to the exposed ends of the metal studs, metal joists or metal members of the wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels; i.e. construction elements, of the invention. The lath is capable of supporting a covering layer constituted by a suitable construction material.. The lath can include one or more portions extending flush on opposite lateral sides, of the construction element, which can be embedded in and anchored also to the concrete used for incorporating and/or joining together one or more adjacent construction elements. [00382] The lath can support one or more covering layers and is typically a stretched metallic lath including a rhomb-shaped mesh having a length-to-height rhomb ratio of about 2:1. The rhomb length can vary between 0.79 and 2.36 in (20 and 60 mm), while the rhomb width can vary between 0.39 and 1.18 in (10 and 30 mm). The stretched metallic lath can have a thickness of from 0.0157 and 0.0591 in (0.4 and 1.5 mm) and, in some cases of from 0.0157 and 0.0394 in (0.4 and 1.0 mm). However, other configurations and sizes may be employed.<br><br>
[00383] The covering layers can, for example, include one or more coating layers of plaster, stucco, cement, etc, as it is or, optionally, reinforced with fibers of a suitable material.<br>
[00384] A particular advantage of the construction panels, wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels according to various embodiments of the present invention is directed to fire protection and safety. As described above, a portion of the reinforcing members in the form of embedded framing studs are exposed and can include a web of holes formed along their length. By exposing a section of the web of holes in the embedded framing studs, air flow is encouraged and in a fire situation, cooling of the web section of the embedded framing studs takes place. This can be very important to prolonging the failure time of a loaded wall section. Typically, in a fire test, an insulated metal stud will fail before a non-insulated stud in'the center web area.<br>
[00385] Locating spacer bars, as described above, in the exposed web section, the embedded framing studs act as a heat sink, helping to dissipate heat from the center web section of the embedded framing studs as well as adding to the structural properties of the wall.<br>
[00386] The melting properties of the polymer matrix in a fire situation further facilitates the cooling of the embedded framing studs web section by melting away from the web as the temperature exceeds 200°F (93*33°C), allowing further air circulation and cooling of the web.<br>
[00387] The bottom track of the wall panel, as described above, can be designed to act as a drip and containment pan in a fire event. The bottom track area is designed to contain the solids that melt when the polymer matrix burns. The bottom track is adapted to hold a volume at least equivalent to the volume of the expanded polymer matrix in the expanded polymer body in liquid or molten form.  Each track section can be<br><br>
designed to have a holding capacity of from at least 0.2 ft3 (5-66 L), in some instances at least 0.25 ft3 (7.08 L) , in some cases at least 0.3 ft3 (8,5 L) and in other cases at least 0.4 ft3 (11.33 L) and the holding capacity can be up to 0.75 ft3 (21.24 L) , in some cases up to 0.65 ft3 (18.41 L) and in other cases up to 0.1 ft3 (2.83 L) of liquid or molten material. The containment volume in the bottom track can be any value or range between any of the values recited above. The holding capacity of the bottom track is typically designed to contain the solids contained in a typical 48" x 96" (1.22 m x 2.44 m) construction panel.<br>
[00388] In larger construction panels, for example those of greater height, the exterior portion of the bottom track can be slotted, allowing for the evacuation of melt materials to the exterior of the building. This design greatly diminishes the interior fire spread and improves the safety of the interior environment of the structure during initial fire spread and rescue operations.<br>
[00389] The wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels of the present invention can be made using batch shape molding techniques. However, this approach can lead to inconsistencies and can be very time intensive and expensive. [00390] In an embodiment of the invention, the wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels of the present invention can be made using an apparatus for molding a semi-continuous or continuous foamed plastic element that includes<br>
a)   a mold including:<br>
i) a bottom wall, a pair of opposite side .walls and a cover, and<br>
ii) a molding seat, having a shape mating that of the element, defined in the mold between the side walls, the bottom wall and the cover;<br><br>
b)	means for displacing the cover and the side walls of the mold towards and away from the bottom wall to longitudinally close and respectively open the mold; and<br>
c)	first means for positioning in an adjustable manner said cover away from and towards said bottom wall of the mold to control in an adjustable and substantially continuous manner the height of the molding seat.<br>
[00391] The apparatus is configured to include reinforcing members which may comprise, for example, embedded framing studs, metal bars, embedded metal joists and other metal profiles which may be configured as discussed above. As a non-limiting example, the methods and apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,792,481 can be adapted to make the wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels of the present invention. The relevant parts of U.S. Patent 5,792,481 are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00392] In an embodiment of the invention, the reinforcing members 220 can be molded into the wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels having a formed embedded end 222 and a straight exposed end 224 as shown in FIG. 127. Subsequently, the straight exposed end can be formed, worked and/or modified to provide a shaped end 22 8A as shown in shaped member 226A in FIG. 128 or a shaped end 228B as shown in shaped member 226B FIG. 129. Embedded ends . 226A and 226B can remain unchanged from embedded end 222. Equipment and machinery for subsequently bending, working, forming or modifying the exposed end are well known in the art. [00393] In an embodiment of the invention, the inner surface, bottom surface, or inner face of the wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels described above can have a grooved . surface, either molded in or applied mechanically, to improve air flow through the annular space between the expanded plastic and any materials attached to the exposed ends of the metal studs, metal joists or metal members<br><br>
of the wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels described above.<br>
[00394] One aspect of various embodiments of the present invention is directed to a method of constructing a building in a first embodiment including:<br>
providing a foundation having a series of walls having top surfaces;<br>
positioning and securing any of the floor units or systems described above, such that the floor unit spans at least some of the top surfaces of the foundation walls to the walls;<br>

positioning and securing the composite building panels described aboire, adapted for use as a roof unit, to at least some of the top slip track of the wall units.<br><br>
[00396] Still another aspect of various embodiments of the present invention is directed to a method of constructing a multi-story building that further includes:<br>
positioning and securing the composite building panels described above, adapted for use as a second floor unit, to at least some( of the top slip track of the wall units; and<br>

where the roof unit is secured to at least some of the top slip track of the second wall units. [00397] Thus, various forms of the present invention also provide a building that contains one or more of the floor units, wall systems and roof systems described above, [00398] The wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels of the present invention provide a number of advantages. For example, they can eliminate the need for house wrap. The expanded polymers used in the present invention may also have at least an equivalent rating as required by local building codes for house wraps. [00399] Also, no insulation subcontractors may be required during construction as the wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels of the invention already include adequate insulation. The materials of construction may also effectively block low frequency sound waves resulting from exterior noise.<br>
[00400] The acoustical properties of the construction panels, wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels are particularly advantageous. Typically, metal studded structures  have  major  acoustical  or  sound  transmission<br><br>
problems. The metal studs will generally amplify sound through their ability to vibrate. When the metal studs are encapsulated in the polymer matrix, vibration is reduced, which * results in reduced vibration and desirable acoustical and sound transmission properties. A non-limiting example of a suitable test method for determining acoustic sound insulative properties of various panels according to the present invention is ASTM E 413-04.<br>
[00401] The panels of the present invention can have good fire resistance properties. Fire resistance of various wall assemblies according to the present invention may be evaluated according to ASTM E 119-00a.<br>
[00402] Also, various panel embodiments of the present invention can have good strength and resistance to shear forces, such as wind resistance. Shear stiffness, shear strength and ductility of various wall assemblies according to the present invention can be evaluated according to ASTM E 2126-05. Horizontal and vertical transverse load, horizontal concentrated/point load and vertical compressive/axial load for various wall or floor assemblies of the present invention can be evaluated according to ASTM E 72-05.<br>
[00403] The wind load resistance at the joint between two panel assemblies of various embodiments of the present invention (foam adhesion strength at the wall panel joint) can be determined according to the following method. The nominal size of each test panel is 4 ft wide by 8 ft long and consists of EPS foam with 2 embedded steel studs at 2 ft on center. [00404] Suitable testing equipment is shown in FIGS. 131-135. Two wooden panel supports, each with the 3 5/8" track and H" dia. bolts at 16" on centers, are arranged as shown in FIGS. 131-135.<br>
[00405] Marked concrete slabs with known weights are used to simulate uniformly distributed load on the foam. The approximate size of each slab is 1 ft by 1 ft by 3.5" thick at<br><br>
110 lb/ft3, a total weight of 32 lb/slab. A V thick plywood panel, 1ft wide by 7 ft long is used to support the slabs on top of the test panels, as discussed below. Pieces of 2x4 lumber are used for bracing as shown in FIGS. 131-135. A rotary laser is used for leveling.<br>
[00406] Data on Applied Loads versus Foam deflection is determined for two testing scenarios. The two testing scenarios are scenario #1 in which the test panels have the foam side oriented as the top surface and scenario #2 in which the test panels have the steel stud side without foam oriented on the top.<br>
[00407] The testing apparatus in assembled as shown in FIGS. 131-135. Two 4 ft x 8 ft panels are placed inside the track side by side such that both panels have the foam side oriented on the top and the steel stud side without the foam facing downward. Weigh the 1 ft wide x 7 ft long x 3/4" thick plywood panel and place it longitudinally over the length of the test panels, 6" off each panel edge. Using, a rotary laser, establish the horizontal line for taking the measurements. Measure the distance between the horizontal to the top of plywood surface at the mid-span and note it as reading 1(or the baseline measurement), for unloaded wall panel j oint. Place the known weights/slabs of approx. 32 lb/ft starting with two slabs (64 lb total) at the center on the plywood panel and move towards the edges of the panel at increment of two slabs/reading time. Record the exact total weight placed on the plywood and its mid-span deflection. Provide some room at mid-span panel joint for taking foam deflection measurements. Keep adding a load increment of 64 lb; measure the distance between the steel cable to the top of plywood and the total weight on the plywood panel. Repeat step #6 and 7 until foam failure. The estimated maximum load range is 250 lb to 560 lb. Record the total weight and the corresponding foam deflection for each load change.<br><br>
[00408] Repeat the above steps for testing scenario #2 (FIG. 135) namely, having both wall panels oriented with steel studs without foam on top and the foam with embedded studs facing downward. The loads will be placed on the Vplywood on foam at the panel joint.<br>
[00409]    The ultimate strength of the panel joint  is determined by foam separation or failure.  In order to prevent the wall finishes (i.e. plaster) from cracking or spalling, the wall panel deflection is limited to L/240, where L is the height of the wall panel or the length of the panel in the orientation of the test.  For example, when the wall panel height is 8 ft or 96 inches, the wall panel deflection is the height divided by 240, i.e., 8 ft x 12 in/240 or 0.4 in. [00410]    Another potential advantage of various embodiments of the present invention is that less framing is required on a job site because of the prefabricated nature of the present wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels. [00411]    The generally faster construction time resulting from using the present wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels allows for earlier enclosure and protection from  the  elements  leading to  less  water  damage  during construction.   Additionally, the provided holes, openings, conduits, chases and spaces in the present wall units, floor units and expanded polymer panels results in faster wiring and plumbing and less job site scrap.<br>
[00412] The present invention also relates to a method of doing business that allows an architectural, design layout to be accessed by the apparatus for molding a semi-continuous or continuous foamed plastic element in order to customize the size, shape and dimensions of the various elements of the construction panels, wall units, floor units, and expanded polymer panels of the invention.

a straight exposed end as shown in FIG. 127 to a shaped end as shown in either of FIGS. 128 and 129.<br>
[00417] in another embodiment of the invention, an interactive computer program can be used to provide the architectural designs described above. In an embodiment of the invention, the architectural design can be inputted using a series of computer screen menus, where a user selects choices made available on a computer screen. When the design button is selected, a screen appears for additional choices for modifying the central body, the embedded framing studs, and/or the spatial relationship between the two. Selecting any of the menus directs to another screen where specific architectural design features as described above can be inputted as well as the number of panels required that have those features. Upon selection, additional customized panels can be inputted. The user then verifies the order by selecting an "order panels" button. The instructions are then relayed to the apparatus for molding a semi-continuous or continuous foamed plastic element and each of the requested number of panels having each of the architectural design features are molded and cut to the order specifications. ■ In an embodiment of the invention, all panels are automatically labeled and marked for placement in their proper position. [00418] ' In a further embodiment, the customer requests access to an interactive program that steps the customer through the design process1. Once the design is complete, the customer can save the design for future use. The customer may also choose to submit the design for an order.<br>
[00419] The use of • a design program on an Internet site benefits the manufacturer in a variety of ways including a method of gathering customer profiles that can later be used for mailings, etc. In addition, an Internet site that includes this unique method of doing business reaches worldwide and generates name recognition for the manufacturer,<br><br>
particularly where the construction panel manufacturer is the is the only manufacturer to offer an accessible and convenient method of designing and ordering composite construction panels.<br>
[00420] Various embodiments of the design program of the present invention provide an advantage for the user in his or her own business in that it raises the level of professionalism of the user by allowing prompt and on-the-spot service for his or her own customers- For example, a customer may bring a sketch or layout for an architectural design a composite construction panel shop requesting . construction panels to use in the layout or design. In response, the panel shop owner, i.e., user, can utilize the design program to build a series of composite construction panels on a computer screen with the customer by his side, and explain to the customer the benefits of the custom composite construction panels. This process provides a first rate service to the customer, eliminates guessing, increases interaction between the panel shop and the end customer, and enhances business reputation in the field.<br>
[00421] FIG. 130 illustrates a method of doing business 400 between a composite construction panel manufacturer 420 and a customer 414, 416 requiring the manufacture of custom composite construction panels. A composite construction panel design program is provided to a customer 414, 416 via a hard copy 418, e.g., a disk containing a copy of the program, or via electronic access, e.g., the Internet or e-mail.
