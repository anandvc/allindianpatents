SPECIFICATION<br><br>
TITLE: PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM<br>
NAME: DR. PRAKASH BHAVE AND SHRI. SURESH PATWARDHAN<br>
ADDRESS: â€˜NIKHIL PRIDE', TILAK ROAD, 2042, SADASHIV PETH, PUNE- 411030, Maharashtra, India.<br>
NATIONALITY: SUBJECTS OF THE REPUBLIC OF INDIA.<br>
The following Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM, and more particularly to systems for recovery of chemical vapors while loading and<br>
unloading into tanks for storage and usage, and thereby reducing pollution in air<br>
while filling of petrol into vehicle tank with a modified dispensing gun. This invention is aiming particularly petrol/ diesel stations.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In petrol stations, a tanker unloads 10,000 litters petrol/ diesel into ground storage tank, the same amount of petrol / diesel is dispensed into different vehicles everyday. In this process petrol/ diesel vapor, which occupies the unfilled portion of tank, is released to atmosphere, which causes harm to people using petrol pumps, as well to surrounding area.<br>
In countries other than India people are using balloon, gasoline dispenser nozzles to fill this vapor. These known arrangement allow effective open-system recovery of the air-vapor mixture as it continuously adapts the mixture flow rate to the volumetric flow rate of the delivered fuel and to the temperatures of said tanks. It is however not able to recover the excess vapor created in the vehicle tank, which has never been taken into consideration in current recovery systems, and which is determined by the inevitable violent impact of the delivered fuel against the walls of the filler pipe and tank, and by its mixing with the residual fuel contained in the tank, thus giving rise to numerous minute bubbles or foam, which by increasing the heat transfer area results in increased evaporation. This excess evaporation depends mainly on the fuel composition and temperature and on its delivery rate.<br>
Experimental tests have shown that said bubbles or foam give rise to excessive evaporation, with a vapor production which can be as much as 30% to 40% more than the volume of the delivered fuel; during refueling of automobiles and other vehicles, liquid gasoline is delivered into the vehicle fuel tank, and a mixture of gasoline (or other fuel) vapor and air is displaced from the tank. To minimize escape of gasoline vapor into the atmosphere, gasoline dispenser nozzles are typically equipped with vapor recovery vacuum systems to collect the displaced gasoline vapor, and air, and deliver it back into the vapor space of the underground storage tank. Preferably, a 1-to-l ratio balance is sought between volume of liquid gasoline drawn from the underground storage tank, e.g. during vehicle refueling, to volume of gasoline vapor and air returned into the vapor space by the vapor recovery system. However, due to a variety of factors, including, e.g., differences in temperature, inefficiencies in the vapor recovery system, ingestion of excessive external air, etc., such a balance is difficult to achieve. As a result, some amount of gasoline vapor may be discharged, or air ingested, through the underground storage tank pressure/vacuum relief vent<br>
2<br><br>
valve during any 24-hour period of operation.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
These problems are overcome by the present invention PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR<br>
RECOVERY SYSTEM, which recovers the petrol/ diesel and avoids pollution of vapors into air. The equipment invented and used for above purpose consists of a specially designed very low- pressure drop condenser with a temperature reducing mechanism. The equipment is connected to underground tanks exhaust port or to petrol/ diesel dispenser through a special bellow and pipe. A mechanism is invented to avoid moisture in atmosphere from getting mixed with recovered petrol/ diesel vapor, which is also a part of the total equipment.<br>
PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM consists of a device useful for recovery of petrol/ diesel vapor escaping from tanks while loading/ unloading, and thereby avoiding air pollution is disclosed.<br>
The device is a condenser with specific internal design. A cooling arrangement for cooling to required temperature. This device is to be connected to vapor outlet by suitable connection. This devise can be used for filling of petrol into vehicle tank with a modified dispensing gun.<br>
The PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM consists of a center tube with spiral fins. This tube is housed into a tube, which forms outer body of the condenser. The outside tube has an opening through which vapor flows into system. A cooling coil is wound on inside tube and on outside tube; this forms the recovery condenser. The outlet is for condensed vapor outlet. The air moisture condenser having same construction is fixed above recovery condenser. The length of this condenser is determined on the basis of gases and vapor flow.<br>
Petrol/ diesel tanker unload its product into the ground tank through inlet port. This displaces trapped petrol Diesel vapor to atmosphere through outlet port. Our system is fixed to this outlet port. The system is a specially designed condensing unit, which converts petrol/ diesel vapor into liquid form. This saves precious fossil fuel and reduces atmospheric pollution.<br>
Similar phenomenon occurs when petrol/ diesel is filled into the fuel tank of the vehicle for which suitable external attachment for fuel dispensing gun/ nozzle is used.<br>
Both the systems contemplate to use the source of energy for cooling as<br>
1.	Standard refrigeration unit which runs on electricity/ solar power.<br>
2.	Ice<br>
3.	Dry ice<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
 FIG. 1, shows fixing of PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM with ground storage tank (1). The recovery system consists of a special condenser (5) with condenser for atmosphere moisture (3). A chiller (6) is connected to condensers (3), (5) to cool vapor and convert to liquid. There is a port (2) which is open to atmosphere to avoid any pressure from developing in the system and ground tank. Inlet port (7) is inlet for ground tank. Petrol/ diesel is un-loaded into tank through inlet port (7)._AII vapors in the tank (1) pass through condenser (5). The low temperature in condenser (5) converts this vapor to liquid form and flow back to tank (1). While petrol/ diesel is pumped out from the tank, vacuum is created in the tank (1). This converts some petrol/ diesel into vapor; also some amount of out side air is sucked into tank (1) through port (2). This air contains some moisture. The air with moisture passes through condenser (3). The low temperature in condenser coverts this moisture into water, which drains out through outlet port (4). Thus this moisture is avoided from getting mixed with petrol/ diesel in tank (1).<br>
FIG. 2, shows fixing PETROL7 DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM with petrol/ diesel vending unit (8). A hose pipe (9) with attached dispensing gun (10) fills the vehicle tank (11). The dispensing gun is also fixed with a rubber bellow (12) and a hose pipe (13) which is an additional system of the invention. This hose is connected to PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM (3), (5). When operator starts filling petrol into the vehicle tank, vapor in the tank flow out. The rubber below is designed such that this vapor is flown to recovery system through hose pipe (13). The PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR RECOVERY SYSTEM (3), (5) condenses this vapor into liquid petrol and avoids it from polluting atmosphere. The vacuum produced due to this condensing is enough to draw<br>
4<br><br>
more vapors into system. The recovered liquid is collected in a tank and removed by the end of the day.<br>
FIG. 3, shows the internal construction of the PETROL/ DIESEL VAPOR<br>
RECOVERY SYSTEM (3), (5). This consists of a center tube (14) with spiral fins.<br>
This tube is housed into a tube (15), which forms outer body of the condenser (3), (5). The outside tube has an opening (16) through which vapor flows into system. A cooling coil (17) is wound on inside tube and on outside tube (18); this forms the recovery condenser (3), (5). The outlet (19) is for condensed vapor outlet. The air moisture condenser (3) is having same construction and is fixed above recovery condenser. The length of this condenser is determined on the basis of gases and vapor flow. (4) is outlet for condensed moisture in air.<br>
