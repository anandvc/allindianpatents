At the outset of the description, which follows, it is to be understood that the ensuing description only illustrates a particular form of this invention. However, such a particular form is only an exemplary embodiment, without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and teaching of the invention and not intended to be taken restrictively.<br><br><br>
BREIF  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an Algae production system in a batch type of Algae Collector Design (ACD) and in a continuous or semi-continuous type of reactors (CAR) wherein the CAR comprises of a channel Algae pond covered with inflated plastics (UV stabilized Polyethylene/PVC, etc.), which is inflated by connecting with exhaust gas from diesel engine/power plant/air blower, etc. The pond or channel is lined with black plastics or paint and filled up with water (saline, brackish, etc.) and with suitable Algae species. Such a system helps to improve the productivity of Algae as it provides the right utilization of solar energy, water and exhaust gases-mainly CO2.<br>
The CAR comprises of transparent plastic tubes filled up with jute/plastic net. Saline water is allowed to enter from the top of such a reactor and from the bottom gases are blown in a counter current manner. Algae species are allowed to grow on the packed material. The saline water exiting from the bottom is recycled through a collection pond.<br>
Algae produced by both the types of reactor systems, is then processed through centrifuge and a press system to recover oil (for Biofuel) and/or other useful products like neutroceuticals, etc. and the left over pressed cake is further used as organic fertilizer, animal feed, etc. The entire system is environment-friendly and with a great deal of application potential to convert natural resources like the solar energy, water, algae, etc to high value and useful products like Biofuel, nutrition, etc.<br><br><br>
Water (saline and brackish) is taken from a water pond and pumped through tubes viz. CAR. In ACD, the water is kept in channel for several days before harvesting of the Algae. The inflated plastic film helps conserve solar energy and utilizes C02 from the exhaust gases for the better and faster growth of Algae species. At regular interval of the time, the Algae is harvested for further process for centrifuge /drying followed by extraction of oil or other useful products.<br>
The second or parallel stream of warm saline water is taken to continuous/semi-continues Algae reactor (CAR). Such a water is pumped through a common header to a number of CAR reactors packed with proper media like jute/plastic net/packed pebbles, etc. Such media helps in closer interaction and more residence time (RT) for the water and exhaust gases, which have entered from the bottom. The transparent tubes/film improves use of solar energy falling on the Algae species for accelerating the growth of Algae production.<br>
A number of CAR reactors are clamped through a common header at the top as well as bottom. The produced biomass from such reactors are taken for processing through centrifuge, dryer, etc. and then through the press for producing Algae biofuel and biomass.<br>
In this process, the saline water (sea, brackish, municipal, etc) is pumped from the source of the batch type of ACD. Suitable species of Algae is kept in this collector and because of the favourable condition with respect to solar energy, exhaust gas (C02, etc) and the closed system, the growth of Algae is favourable and fast. The water in the process gets heated by solar energy as in typical solar water heater. This water is available for the continuous. Algae reactor (CAR), ASLO. In the continuous Algae reactor, warm saline water is pumped from a common<br><br><br>
