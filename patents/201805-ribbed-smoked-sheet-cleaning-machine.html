				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a device for cleaning sheet rubber materials. More particularly the present invention relates to a novel semiautomatic mechanical device for the cleaning of sheet rubber. The present invention is particularly useful to owners of small rubber plantations as it is cost effective and easy to use producing better grade sheet rubber. Background of the invention<br>
Natural rubber after being extracted from the trees and treated with various chemicals is processed into different marketable forms such as ribbed smoked sheets, solid blocks, crepes and concentrated latex. Ribbed Smoked Sheet, which is one of the most popular form of marketed rubber in India, is graded by visual examination for the presence of dirt, dust, tackiness, fimgus, colored spots blisters, bubbles etc.<br>
In the Indian scenario, majority of the rubber produce comes from small plantations with an area less than a hectare. Latex collected from such small holdings is processed mainly into Ribbed Smoked Sheets, while the field coagulum is converted in to either block rubber or low grade crepe. One of the major drawbacks of the rubber processed from these small holdings is the low quality of the sheet rubber being produced. Lack of consistency in the quality of the rubber is also an area of concern. Despite diligent efforts by the Rubber Board to organize processing of small holders' latex, bulk of the latex produced by the small holdings is still processed by the growers themselves into poor quality rubber sheets, due to socio-economic hindrances.<br>
Although, block rubber conforming to technical specifications has been claimed to be superior to conventional forms of processed rubber, such claim does not have adequate justification, especially considering the price of block rubber, which is considerably higher than sheet rubber. Moreover, rubber good manufactures are today, preferring good quality rubber sheets to block rubber.<br>
One of the major causes for low quality of sheet rubber produced in these small holdings is imscientific drying methods. Very often the sheets are dried in open siin, laying them on the bare ground, on the bare roof of the<br><br>
buildings, on compound walls and even on public roads, causing accumulation of dirt, overheating and incomplete drying. This causes mould growth and surface contamination, thereby reducing the quality of the sheet rubber. The conventional method of smoke drying is not practiced widely mainly on accoimt of the high capital requirement and increasing cost of firewood. Since sun dr5ring is the cheapest method, it is obviously most popular.<br>
The quality of the sheets would definitely improve if the sheets are cleaned and dried properly. The manual method of cleaning is laborious and costly, and often does not clean the sheets adequately, as certain impurities still remain in tiny grooves and ridges which cannot be reached by the manual method. Hence a mechanical device for a more scientific cleaning of low quality sheet rubber has been developed with a cost effective technology, which the small land holders, rubber dealers, and rubber producer societies can afford and utilize.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel sheet rubber cleaning machine which is cost effective and easy to use and handle.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a machine for the cleaning of sheet rubber so as to improve the quality of the sheets.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a machine that has a low energy consumption and has a high output rate and is easy to operate.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are achieved by the novel machine of the present invention, which essentially consists of rollers operating at different speeds, to at once step stretch the rubber sheets and clean them thoroughly even between the ribbed portions. The differential speeds of the rollers are so selected that the stretching is large enough to open the space between the ribs for the thorough cleaning thereof yet within the threshold of the tolerance limits of the elasticity of the sheet rubber.<br><br>
The rollers are moveably mounted over a frame to enable them to be adjusted with respect to each other both in terms of height and distance. This enables processing of rubber sheets of different lengths and thicknesses.<br>
At least two sets of rollers are provided one or both of which may be provided with brushes. TTie brushes help in thorough cleaning of the rubber sheets.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the machine comprises two sets of rollers one of which is a feed roller and other has bristles or brushes for cleaning.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, there is provided one set of feed rollers and two sets of brush rollers.<br>
Preferably, the feed rollers have a square cut design on the surface thereof for aiding in the proper gripping and feeding in of the rubber sheets.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, all the rollers rotate at different speeds with the speed of the brush rollers being higher than the speed of the feed rollers so that the rubber sheets may be stretched between the different sets of rollers. It is preferred that the second set of brush rollers rotate at the same speed or more preferably, at a higher speed than the first set of brush rollers.<br>
A source of water or any other cleaning liquid is connected to the frame for spraying the cleaning liquid on the rubber sheets. The constant spra5dng of the cleaning liquid and simultaneous scrubbing by the brush rollers on the stretched rubber sheets results in the quality of cleaning hitherto not considered possible.<br>
The feed rollers may be a set of cast iron/ mild steel rolls. The rollers may be electrically driven by one or more motors although this invention is not limited by the drive means or mechanisms. The source of cleaning liquid may be actuated mechanically or electrically. The rollers may preferably be mounted over alximinum plates to prevent the rubber sheets from falling down, all arranged in a mild steel framework which is provided with stainless steel /aluminum feeding and receiving trays.<br><br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to accompanying drawings in which: Fig. 1 is the plan of the present invention Fig. 2 is the elevation of the present invention Fig. 3 is the right side view of the present invention Fig. 4A is the cross section of the brush roll of the present invention Fig. 4B is the cross section of the feed roll of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Figures, Mi and Ma are drive motors attached to the machine on either side thereof. M2 is connected to the pulley P2, by the V-Belt Vi (see Fig. 3) which is further connected to the other pulleys. Pi, P3, P4, Ps and Pe, via V-belts V2 and V3 (see Fig. 2), making them rotate. Pe rotates the feed rollers Ri, P4 rotates the first brush rollers R2 and P2 rotates the second brush rollers R3. Roller nip adjustments RAi, RA2 and RA3 are provided for adjusting rollers Ri, R2 and R3 respectively with respect to each other. In a highly preferred embodiment, the feed rollers, Ri run at a speed of 90 rpm, whereas R2 and R3 rotate at 300 rpm and 360 rpm respectively. The invention is however not limited by the speed of the rollers and different speed may be envisaged within the scope of the present invention depending upon several factors such as the nature of the rubber sheets, the state of dirt, the ultimate purpose for which it is required etc. All the three rollers are arranged in a row and the length of each roll is preferably, 70 cm. The brushes preferably are of nylon bristles of 2.5 cm length although brushes of different material such as steel, Teflon, rubber or other material of different length and thicknesses are possible within the scope of the present invention. The brushes are preferably, fixed on a PVC roll which has a steel shaft through its center (see Fig. 4A). The feed roll is preferably, made of cast iron with a square cut design and has a diameter of 7.5 cm (see Pig. 4B).<br>
E^ch set of rolls (Ri, R2 and R3), consist of two rollers one at the top and one at the bottom. In a preferred embodiment, the pulleys at the left rotate the rollers at the top, while the pullejrs at the right rotate the bottom rollers. Concentrating at the rollers itself, the feed roller has a cast iron shaft<br><br>
running through its center on which it rotates. The square cut design of the feed roll ensures that the sheet does not move too quickly, as the grooves in the roll hold on to the surface deformities of the sheet and gives ample time to the brush roUs to clean the sheet (see Fig. 4B). Both the brush rolls may ideally have the same dimensions. The steel shaft, preferably has a diameter of 3 cm. With the PVC coating the diameter may increase to 7.5 cm and with the addition of the bristles, the total diameter of the brush roll may be 12.5 cm. However, as stated above, the dimensions are not critical to the invention.<br>
In use, the sheets are first fed to the cast iron rolls and as th^ come out they are pulled out by the first set of brush rolls in a forced spray of water or other cleaning agent, which is applied on the sheet from the top and the bottom via sprays Wi and Wa (see Fig, 2). Since the speed of the brush roll is higher than the feed roll, the former tends to pull the sheet. However, due to the grooves on the surface of the feed roll, the sheet moves slowly and the brush roll is able to thoroughly clean it. Moreover, due to the different speeds and the grooves on the feed roll the ridges and grooves on the sheet tend to expand, giving space to the bristles to clean the sheets in areas which were earlier inaccessible or impossible to clean.<br>
These partially cleaned sheets coming out from the first set of brush rolls pass through the second set of brush rolls under the same principle of different speeds, the sheets are puUed forward. Again, the cleaning agent such as water is sprayed from both above and below while the sheet is being cleaned by the brush rolls. For easy movement of the sheets, the rolls preferably are arranged in a slanting manner. The top rollers have an upper and lower movement facility to accommodate sheets of different thickness (see Fig. 1)<br>
The cleaning done by the present invention, ensures high quality sheets upon drying. Cleaning of both the top layer and the bottom layer takes two to three seconds yielding an output of 20 to 30 sheets per minute depending on the setting of the rolls.<br><br>
It must be borne in mind that the present invention has been illustrated above with reference to the most preferred embodiment and other modification and embodiments of the invention are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
