				<td>Technical Field<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to thienopyrazole derivatives,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof, having selective<br>
PDE 7 (phosphodi.esterase VII) inhibiting effect. Further, the present<br>
invention relates to an intermediate compounds for preparing said theino-<br>
pyrazole derivatives and a process for producing them. These compounds<br>
are effective compounds for treating various kinds of diseases such as<br>
allergic diseases, inflammatory diseases and immunological diseases.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002]<br>
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) or cyclic GMP (cGMP), which is an intracellular<br>
second messenger substance, is decomposed and inactivated by<br>
phosphodiesterases (PDE 1 to PDE 11) . The PDE 7 selectively decomposes<br>
cAMP, and is characterized as an enzyme which is not inihibited by rolipram.<br>
Rolipram is a selective inhibitor of PDE 4, which decomposes cAMP similarly.<br>
[0003]<br>
It is suggested that PDE 7 plays an important role for activating<br>
T cells (Beavo, et al., Science, 283, 848 (1999)), and is well known that<br>
activation of 0-cell is concerned with the exacerbation of allergic<br>
diseases, inflammatory diseases or immunological diseases. These<br>
diseases are for example bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis, chronic<br>
obstructive pulmonary disease, allergic rhinitis, psoriasis, atopic<br>
dermatitis, conjunctivitis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,<br>
multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel<br>
disease, hepatitis, pancreatitis, encephalomyelitis, sepsis, Crohn's<br>
disease, rejection reaction in transplantation, graft versus host disease<br>
(GVH disease), and restenosis after angioplasty [J. Allergy Clin.<br><br>

Pt 2): S33-7; Clin. Exp. Allergy, 2000 Feb; 30(2): 242-54; Hosp. Med.,<br>

Therefore, it is considered that a compound having PDE 7 inhibiting<br>
effect is useful for treating various kinds of diseases such as allergic<br>
diseases, inflammatory diseases or immunological diseases concerned with<br>
T cells..<br>
[0004]<br>
There has been proposed that many compounds selectively inhibit<br>
PDE 7. There can be mentioned the examples such as imidazopyridine<br>
derivatives (Parent Document 1) , dihydropurine derivatives (Patent<br>
Document 2) , pyrrole derivatives (Patent Document 3) ,<br>
benzothiopyranoimidazolone derivatives (Patent Document 4) , heterocyclic<br>
compounds (Patent Document 5; Patent Document 6) , quinazoline and<br>
pyridopyrimidine derivatives (Patent Document 7), spiro tricyclic<br>
compounds (PatentDocument 8) , thiazole andoxathiazolederivatives (Patent<br>
Document 9), sulfonamide derivatives (Patent Document 10), hetero-<br>
biarylsulfonamicle derivatives (Patent Document 11) , dihydroisoquinoline<br>
derivatives (Patent Document 12) , guanine derivatives (Non-Patent Document<br>
1), benzothiadiazine derivatives and benzothienothiadiazine derivatives<br>
(Non-Patent Document 2, and Non-Patent Document 3) . However, no curative<br>
medicines having PDE 7 inhibiting effect as main pharmacological mechanism<br>
have developed up to now.<br>
[0005]<br><br>
Though some compounds having thienopyrazole skeleton have been<br>
known (Patent Documents 13 - 24; Non-Patent Documents 4-8), there is<br>
no suggestion that these compounds have PDE 7 inhibiting effect. Further,<br>
the method for producing the thienopyrazole derivatives of the present<br>
invention has been reported (Won-Patent Documents 9 - 11) ; however, the<br>
substituents on ;he thienopyrazole skeleton are different from those of<br>
the present invention.<br>

lower eilkyl group)<br>
 [0082]<br>
First, the compound (VI) obtained from the compound (VIII) by reacting<br>
with R1NHNH2 (VII) in accordance with the known method (e.g., International<br>
Patent Publication WO 03/053, 975) . Namely, the compound (VIII) is reacted<br>
with 1 to 2 equivalents, preferably about 1 equivalent of the compound<br>
 (VII) in the solvent or absent of the solvent at room temperature to 120Â°C.<br>
The solvent to be used in the reaction is inorganic acid aqueous solution<br>
such as hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid; aromatic carbon hydrate such<br>
as benzene or toluene; organic acid such as acetic acid; ethers such as<br>
1,4-dioxane or tetrahydrofuran; halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
 dichloromethane; alcohols such as methanol or ethanol; or the mixture<br>
solvent there of.<br>
[0083]<br>
After the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture is neutralized<br>
and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is nonmiscible<br>
 solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially with<br>
waterandsaturatedsalinesolution. Then, thecompound (VI) canbeobtained<br>
by removal of the solvent. This compound (VI) can be purified by<br><br>
recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
[0084]<br>
The starting compounds (VII) and (VIII) to be used in this reaction<br>
can be commercially available or can be known compounds (e.g., J. Org.<br>
Chem., 1981, 46, 5414-5415). Further, the compounds (VII) can be used<br>
as salt with acidic compounds, such as hydrochloric acid salt or acetic<br>
acid salt.<br>
[0085]<br>
Then, the resulting compound (VI) is converted to the compound (V)<br>
in accordance with the common method. Namely, the reaction can be conducted<br>
by reacting the compound (VI) with 1 to 6 equivalents of halogenating<br>
reagent such as phosphorous oxychloride or thionyl chloride in aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene or toluene, or the absence of the<br>
solvent, at room temperature to refluxing temperature of the solvent for<br>
1 to 12 hours. After the reaction is completed, the compound (V) can be<br>
obtained by removal of the solvent.<br>
[0086]<br>
The obtained compound (V) is converted, without further purification,<br>
to the compound (IV) by an electrophilic substitution reaction. For example,<br>
the compound, (V) in which R3 is a hydrogen atom, can be obtained by Vilsmeier<br>
reaction with the reaction reagent prepared from 1 to 5 equivalents of<br>
phosphorus oxychloride, in the amide solvent such as N, N-dimethylf ormamide .<br>
The reaction is carried out at room temperature to 120Â°C for 1 to 12 hours.<br>
After the reaction is completed, inorganic base aqueous solution<br>
such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution is added to the the reaction<br>
mixture and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is<br>
nonmiscible solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially<br>
with warer and saturated saline solution. Then, the compound (IV) can<br>
be obtained by removal of the solvent. This compound (IV) can be purified<br>
by column chromatography or recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
[0087]<br>
Further, the compound (IV) can be converted directly from the compound<br>
(IV) by Vilsmeier reaction in single process, or one-pot synthesis reaction<br><br>
without separation of the intermediate compound (V) . Namely, the compound<br>
(VI) is treated with 2 to 5 equivalents of phosphorous oxychloride without<br>
using the reaction solvent at room temperature to 120Â°C to obtain the<br>
compound (V) in the reaction mixture. Then, to this reaction mixture<br>
containing the resulting compound (V) is added formamide solvents such<br>
as N,N-dimethyl::ormamide at 0Â°C to 120Â°C, and the Vilsmeier reaction is<br>
carried out at room temperature to 120Â°C for 1 to 24 hours.<br>
After the reaction is completed, inorganic base aqueous solution<br>
such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution is added to the the reaction<br>
mixture and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is<br>
nonmiscible solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially<br>
with water and saturated saline solution. Then, the compound (IV) can<br>
be obtained by removal of the solvent. This compound (IV) can be purified<br>
by column chromatography or recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
[0088]<br>
Then, the obtained compound (IV) is converted to the compound (II) .<br>
The reaction is carried out by treating the compound (IV) with 1 to 1.5<br>

to 80Â°C for 0.5 to 8 hours. The solvent to be used in this reaction is<br>
polar solvent such as acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide; ethers such<br>
as 1,4-dioxane or tetrahydrofuran; halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
dichloromethane; alcohols such as methanol or ethanol; or the mixture<br>
solvent thereof. In this reaction, the compound (III) is previously treated<br>
with base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydride, potassium<br>
tert-butoxide, sodium methylate or sodium hydroxide.<br>
After the reaction is completed, water is added to the the reaction<br>
mixture and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is<br>
nonmiscible solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially<br>
with water and saturated saline solution. Then, the compound (II) can<br>
be obtained by removal of the solvent. This compound (II) can be purified<br>
by column chromatography or recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
[0089]<br>
Then, the obtained compound (II) is converted to the compound (I)<br><br>
of the present invention by ring formation reaction.<br>
The reaction condition of this ring formation may vary depending<br>
on the variety of the group R4. When the group R4 is the group: -CO2R7,<br>
the compound (I) can be obtained from the compound (II) by treating with<br>
1 to 1.5 equivalents of the base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydride,<br>
sodium methylate or sodium hydroxide in the solvent at 0Â°C to 80Â°C for<br>
0.5 to 24 hours. The solvent to be used in this reaction is polar solvent<br>
such as acetonitrile or N,N-dimethylformamide; ethers such as 1, 4-dioxane<br>
or tetrahydrofuran; halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane;<br>
alcohols such as methanol or ethanol; or the mixture solvent there of.<br>
After the reaction is completed, water is added to the the reaction<br>
mixture and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is<br>
nonmiscible solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially<br>
with water and Sciturated saline solution. Then, the compound (I) can be<br>
obtained by removal of the solvent. This compound (I) can be purified<br>
by column chromatography, if necessary.<br>
[0090]<br>
Further, when the group R4 is the group: -C02R7, the compound (I)<br>
can be obtained from the compound (IV), without the separatiuon of the<br>
compound (II) in the corresponding stepwise reaction.<br>
[0091]<br>
When the group R4 is an aryl group which may be substituted or a<br>
heteroaryl group which may be substituted, the compound (I) can be obtained<br>
from the compound (II) by treating with 1 to 3 equivalents of the strong<br>
base such as lithium diisopropylamide or lithium bis (trimethylsilyl) amide<br>
in the ethers such as diethylether or tetrahydrofuran.<br>
After the reaction is completed, water is added to the the reaction<br>
mixture and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is<br>
nonmiscible solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially<br>
with water and saturated saline solution, then, the organic solvent is<br>
removed off. The resulting residue is dissolved in alcohols such as methanol<br>
or ethanol, and the acid such as hydrochloric acid is added to the mixture,<br>
and then, the mixture is stirred at room temperature to 60Â°C to obtain<br><br>
the compound (I).<br>
After the reaction is completed, water is added to the the reaction<br>
mixture and the mixture is extracted with an organic solvent, which is<br>
nonmiscible solvent with water, and the organic layer is washed sequentially<br>
with water and saturated saline solution. Then, the compound (I) can be<br>
obtained by removal of the solvent. This compound (I) can be purified<br>

(I) in which the group R4 is -C02R7 obtained by the method described above,<br>
is converted to -;he compound (I) in which the group R4 is -CO2H. This<br>
convertion reaction is the hydrolysis reaction of ester compound, and<br>
can be carried out in the several manners. For example, the hydrolysis<br>
reaction can be carried out in the presence of the base such as sodium<br>
hydroxide, in the solvent at room temperature to refluxing temperature<br>
of the solvent. The solvent to be used in the reaction may be alcohols<br>
such as methanol or ethanol; water; or ~he mixture solvent thereof. After<br>
the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture is condensed, and the<br>
mixture is neutralized by adding hydrochloric acid to obtain the compound<br>
(I) in which the group R4 is -C0?H.<br>
Then, the resulting compound (I) in which the group R4 is -CO2H is<br>
converted to the compound in which the group R4 is -CONR5R6 by amidation<br>
reaction in accordance with the several known methods. For example, the<br>
compound (I) in which the group R4 is -CO2H is converted to the corresponding<br>
acid chloride by treating with the halogenating reagent such as phosphorous<br>
oxychloride or thionyl chloride. Then, the obtained acid chloride is<br>
treated with the amine compound HNR5R6 in the presence of base catalyst<br>
such as triethylcimine in solvent at 0Â°C to room temperature. The solvent<br>
to be used in the reaction may be halogenated hydrocarbons such as<br>
dichloromethane; aromoatic hydrocarbons such as toluene or benzene;<br>
ethers such as di.ethylether or tetrahydrofurane; or the mixture solvent<br>
thereof.<br>
After the reaction is completed, the reaction mixture is diluted<br><br>
with the organic: solvent, which is nonmiscible solvent with water, and<br>
the organic layer is washed sequentially with water and saturated saline<br>
solution. Then, the compound (I) in which the group R4 is -CONR5Rb can<br>
be obtained by removal of the solvent. This compound can be purified by<br>
column chromatography or recrystallization, if necessary.<br>

be used or the reaction conditions to be applied can be easily established<br>
in accordance with the standard text book and the examples mentioned later.<br>

Methods for evaluating the PDE 7 inhibiting effect<br><br>
The PDE 7 (phosphodiesterase VII) inhibiting effect of the compounds<br>
of the present invention was performed by the following method, which<br>
was modified assay method described in Biochemical. Pharmacol. 48(6),<br>
1219-1223 (1994).<br>
(1)	The active fraction of PDE 7 (phosphodiesterase VII) was obtained.<br>
That is, MOLT-4 (obtainable from ATCC as ATCC No. CRL-1582), which was<br>
cell line of human acute lymphoblastic lymphoma T cells, was incubated<br>
in RPMI1640 culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum to obtain<br>
5 X 108 MOLT-4 cells. The cells were collected by centrifugation and<br>
 suspended with lOmL of buffer solution A [25mM of tris-HCl, 5mM of<br>
2-mercaptoethnol, 2mM of benzamidine, 2mM of EDTA, 0. ImM of<br>
4- (2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl hydrochloride; pH 7.5], then homogenized<br>
by PolytronÂ® homogenizer. The homogenate were centrifuged under 25,000<br>
X G for 10 minutes at 4Â°C. The supernatant was separated and thus obtained<br>
supernatant was further centrifuged under 100,000 X G for 60 minutes at<br>
4Â°C, and then filtrated with 0.2um filter to obtain the soluble fraction.<br>
[0100]<br>
(2)	The obtained soluble fraction was filled in equilibrium HiTrap Q<br>
column (5mL X 2) with buffer solution A, and phosphodiesterase fractions<br>
 were eluted by 300mL of buffer solution A with linear gradient from 0<br>
to 0.8 M NaCl concentration. 5mL each of 60 eluents were collected, and<br>
each eluents were examined for cyclic AMP metabolic activities of<br>
phosphodiesterase. The fraction eluting with about 350mM NaCl<br>
concentration parts, where metabolic activities were not inactivated by<br>
lOuM of rolipram (selective inhibitor for phosphodiesterase IV) and lOuM<br>
of milrinone (selective inhibitor for phosphodiesterase III), were<br>
collected as storage solution for using to test PDE 7 inhibiting effect.<br>
[0101]<br>
(3)	The tested compound having desired concentration was reacted in<br>
 the solution of 2 OmM tris-HCl (pH7.5), lmMofMgCl2, lOOuM of EDTA, 330ug/mL<br>
of bovine serum albumin, 4ug/mL of 5'-nucleotidase, O.luCi of 3H~cAMP<br>
(0.064uM of cAMP), lOuM of rolipram in storage solution of PDE 7 for 2<br>
hours at 25Â°C. After the reaction, suspension of SephadexÂ®-QAE in lOmM<br><br>
of HEPES-Na (pH 7.0) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture<br>
was left at rest for 5 minutes. Further, SephadexÂ®-QAE was added to the<br>
obtained superneitant and the mixture was left at rest for 5 minutes, then,<br>
the radioactivity of the solution was measured.<br>
[0102]<br>
(4) IC50 was calculated as 50% inhibiting concentration of the metabolic<br>
activities of phosphodiesterase VII of the tested compound.<br>
[0103]<br>
The compounds of the present invention selectively inhibit PDE 7<br>
 and their selectivities are more than 10 times compared to other<br>
phosphodiesterase. Therefore, it is expected that the side effect of the<br>
compounds of the present invention caused by other isozyme to be less.<br>
[0104]<br>
For exampLe, the selectivity against PDE 4 (phosphodiesterase IV)<br>
 of the compounds of the present invention was affirmed by means of the<br>
following Biological Test.<br>
[0105]<br>
Biological Test 2:<br>
Methods for evaluating the PDE 4 inhibiting effect<br>
 The PDE 4 (phosphodiesterase IV) inhibiting effect of the compounds<br>
of the present invention was performed by the following method, which<br>
was modified assay method described in Biochemical. Pharmacol. 48(6),<br>
1219-1223 (1994).<br>
[0106]<br>
 (1) The active fraction of PDE 4 (phosphodiesterase IV) was obtained.<br>
That is, the livers obtained from three Balb/c mice (male, 12 weeks:<br>
obtainable from CXEA Japan, Inc.) were suspended with 3 OmL of buffer solution<br>
B [20mM of bis--;ris, 5mM of 2-mercaptoethnol, 2mM of benzamidine, 2mM<br>
of EDTA, O.lmM of 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzensulfonyl hydrochloride, 50mM of<br>
 sodium acetate; pH6.5], then homogenized by PolytronÂ® homogenizer. The<br>
homogenate were centrifuged under 25,000 X G for 10 minutes at 4Â°C. The<br>
supernatant was separated and thus obtained supernatant was further<br>
centrifuged under 100,000 X G for 6C minutes at 4Â°C, and then filtrated<br><br>
with 0.2um filter to obtain the soluble fraction.<br>
[0107]<br>
(2)	The obtained soluble fraction was filled in equilibrium DEAE<br>
sepharose column (1 X 10cm) with buffer solution B, and phosphodiesterase<br>
fractions were eluted by 120mL of buffer solution B with linear gradient<br>
from 0.05 to 1M sodium acetate concentration. 5 mL each of 24 eluents<br>
were collected, and each eluents were examined for cyclic AMP metabolic<br>
activities of phosphodiesterase. The fraction eluting with about 620mM<br>
of sodium acetate concentration parts, where metabolic activities were<br>
inactivated by 30uMof rolipram (selective inhibitor for phosphodiesterase<br>
IV) , were collected as storage solution to test PDE 4 inhibiting effect.<br>
[0107]<br>
(3)	The tested compound having desired concentration was reacted in<br>
the solution of 2 OmMtris-HCl (pH7.5), lmMofMgCl2, lOOuMof EDTA, 330ug/mL<br>
of bovine serum albumin, 4ug/mL of 5'-nucleotidase, O.luCi of 3H-cAMP<br>
(0.064pM of cAMP), and storage solution of PDE 4 for 2 hours at 25Â°C.<br>
After rhe reaction, suspension of Sephadex@-QAE in lOmM of HEPES-Na (pH<br>
7.0) was added to the reaction mixture, and the mixture was left at rest<br>
for 5 minutes. Further, SephadexÂ®-QAE was added to the obtained supernatant<br>
and the mixture was left at rest for 5 minutes, then, the radioactivity<br>
of the solution was measured.<br>
[0109]<br>
(4)	IC50 was calculated as 50% inhibiting concentration of the metabolic<br>
activities of phosphodiesterase IV of the tested compound.<br>
[0110]<br>
As the results of the mentioned above Biological Test 2, the IC50<br>
of the compounds of PDE 4 inhibiting effect of the present invention was<br>
more than 10 times weaker than that of PDE 7 inhibiting effect.<br>
In the following Tables 1 to 4, the IC50 values of PDE 7 inhibiting<br>
activities and PDE 4 inhibiting activities were summarized.<br>
