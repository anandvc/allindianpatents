				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to electrochemical cells including a connector which<br>
mates with a meter connection device to provide electrical connection to meter circuitry.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Miniature electrochemical cells are useful in applications such as chemical sensing<br>
wherein the electrodes of a strip element interface with an electronic device. The electronic<br>
device, often termed a meter, measures the electrical response of the strip element to the<br>
sample and can also supply power to the strip element to perform a test. In order to<br>
perform these functions, the strip element electrodes must be able to make electrical<br>
connection to the meter circuitry. Such an electrical connection may be made via a<br>
connection device on the meter which mates with areas on the strip element in electrical<br>
communication with the electrochemical cell electrodes.<br>
In configurations of electrochemical cells as disclosed in WO 98/43073, U.S.<br>
5,437,999, EP 0 964 059 A2, WO 00/20626, an upper and a lower electrode face oppose<br>
one another with an electrically insulating layer between them. The electrodes in such a<br>
configuration are typically formed on separate substrates that are assembled during<br>
manufacture of the electrochemical cell. This configuration presents difficulties in<br>
manufacture when forming a part by which the strip element electrodes are connected to the<br>
meter circuitry, as it is different from the usual connection configuration where the<br>
connection areas are all on the same plane.<br>
The issue of connection areas in different planes has been addressed in various<br>
ways, hi WO 98/43073, a method and device are disclosed wherein cut-outs are formed in<br>
one of the electrode layers and in the insulating layer to expose an area of the underlying<br>
electrode layer which can be used as an connection area. In U.S. 5,437,999 and WO<br>
00/20626, a method an device are disclosed wherein a flap is formed on one electrode layer<br>
with a corresponding cut-out in the other electrode layer to expose a suitable connection<br>
area. In this configuration, the insulating layer is cut short so as not interfere with the<br>
connection area.<br>
In EP 0 964 059 A2, the insulating layer is cut short, and a hole is formed in the<br>
upper substrate in order to expose a connection area at the base of the well that is formed.<br>
The well may be filled with a conductive material and a contact made with the conductive<br>
material at the top of the filled well, thus bringing the connection areas onto one plane,<br>
A drawback to these configurations is that they require features on more than one of<br>
the cell layers to be in registration with one another when the layers are assembled into a<br>
working device. This creates difficulties in manufacturing ihe devices and limits the<br>
manufacturing techniques that can be used. In particular, for costs and throughput<br>
considerations, it is often desirable to manufacture the strip elements in a continuous web<br>
form. When using continuous webs it is often difficult to reliably achieve the down-web<br>
registration of repeating features formed on different layers prior to a lamination step.<br>
Often this requires expensive control systems and a relatively fragile fabrication process, if<br>
it is possible at all.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Electrochemical cell connectors that are suitable for use in conjunction with<br>
opposing electrode electrochemical cells, and methods of forming them, that require no<br>
down-web registration steps prior to lamination of the layers are desirable. The preferred<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
The following description and examples illustrate a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention in detail. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous<br>
variations and modifications of this invention that are encompassed by its scope.<br>
Accordingly, the description of a preferred embodiment should not be deemed to limit the<br>
scope of the present invention.<br>
The preferred embodiments relate to devices and methods for forming electrode<br>
connection areas in electrochemical cells with opposing electrodes. The devices and<br>
methods do not require the registration of features formed on different layers prior to the<br>
lamination of the layers. In particular, devices and methods that do not require the down-<br>
web registration of repeating features on different layers during lamination of continuous<br>
webs of devices during manufacture are provided. The preferred embodiments may be used<br>
in conjunction with any suitable fabrication process, for example, a process wherein<br>
discrete sections of the layers are laminated together and wherein it is advantageous to<br>
lessen the registration requirements and therefore the manufacturing complexity.<br>
In another embodiment, preferred elements of the port in a meter device suitable for<br>
use with the disclosed strip connectors are provided.<br>
The basic feature of the electrochemical cells illustrated in Figures 1-6 is that the<br>
edge of at least one electrode layer (herein termed the upper electrode layer) is offset from<br>
at least one other opposing electrode layer (here termed the lower electrode layer) such that<br>
an area of the lower electrode layer overhangs the edge of the upper electrode layer, thus<br>
exposing an area of the lower electrode layer suitable for connection to meter circuitry.<br>
Figures 1 to 6 depict views of various preferred embodiments of electrochemical<br>
cell connectors. Figures la, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a, and 6a depict top views of sections of web or<br>
card of the assembled layers for various embodiments, showing the repeating features.<br>
Figures 1b, 2b, 3b, 4b, 5b, and 6b depict the corresponding cross-sectional views.<br>
In Figures 1 to 6, element 1 is the lower electrode layer. This layer consists of an<br>
electrically insulating substrate with an electrically conductive coating applied to its upper<br>
face, wherein the electrically conductive coating is in electrical contact with at least a first<br>
electrode of the electrochemical cell.<br>
Element 2 is the upper electrode layer. This layer consists of an electrically<br>
insulating substrate with an electrically conductive coating applied to its lower face,<br>
wherein the electrically conductive coating is in electrical contact with at least a second<br>
electrode of the electrochemical cell.<br>
Element 3 is an electrically insulating layer which serves to space elements 1 and 2<br>
apart. In preferred embodiments, the upper and lower faces of element 3 are adhesive and<br>
also serve to adhere the layers of the device together. In this preferred embodiment,<br>
element 3 may consist of a substrate coated with an adhesive. Alternatively it may consist<br>
of just an adhesive layer.<br>
Element 4 is a cut-out feature in element 1 which, as illustrated in Figures 2 to 6,<br>
serves to give access to an exposed area of the electrically conductive coating on the lower<br>
face of element 2.<br>
In Figure 1, one edge of element 2 is offset from the corresponding edge of element<br>
1, such that an overhanging area of the conductive coating on element 1 is exposed. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, a tongue of electrically insulating substrate material with electrically<br>
conductive coatings or layers on its upper and lower feces is inserted between elements 1<br>
and 2 to make electrical connection to the meter circuitry.<br>
In Figure 2, a through hole is cut in element 1 to expose an area of the conductive<br>
coating on element 2 for electrical connection. This obviates the need for having a<br>
connection device inserted between the layers.<br>
The device depicted in Figure 3 is similar to that depicted in Figure 2, except that an<br>
extra portion of element 3 has been inserted between elements 1 and 2. This configuration<br>
is desirable if it is likely that elements 1 and 2 will be pushed together during use and thus<br>
create an electrical short-circuit between the conductive coatings on elements 1 and 2.<br>
Figure 4 depicts an embodiment where a slot has been formed in element 1 which<br>
gives access to an area of the conductive coating on element 2.<br>
Figure 5 depicts a similar embodiment to Figure 2. However in this embodiment<br>
the edge of element 3 is such that it is above element 4 in element 1. In order for this<br>
embodiment to be operable in the preferred embodiment elements 1 and 2 must be<br>
laminated or otherwise assembled together before element 4 is formed.<br>
Figure 6 depicts a similar embodiment to Figure 4. However in this embodiment<br>
the edge of element 3 is such that it is at least close to the edge of element 1. In this<br>
embodiment, it is preferred that elements 1 and 2 be laminated or otherwise assembled<br>
together before element 4 is formed.<br>
In another embodiment, methods are disclosed for forming electrical connections to<br>
some of the connection devices discussed above.<br>
For the electrochemical cells of the preferred embodiments depicted in Figures 2 to<br>
6, it is suitable to use parts for the connection of the conductive coatings on elements 1 and<br>
2 to external circuitry such as those described in copending U.S. patent application<br>
09/399,512 filed on September 20,1999.<br>
For the embodiment depicted in Figure 1, a different configuration for external<br>
connection is desirable. For this embodiment, it is desirable to split element 1 from<br>
element 2 in the connector area to allow easier access for a tongue connection device.<br>
According to this aspect of the embodiment, element 1 is split from element 2 during<br>
insertion of the strip connector into external circuitry connector, e.g., by a blade or wedge-<br>
shaped projection, or other suitable splitting device.<br>
Figures 7 and 8 show a side view and end view, respectively, that illustrate the<br>
splitting of element 1 from element 2 in the connector area to allow access for a tongue<br>
connection device. Figures 9 and 10 show this embodiment with a strip partially and folly<br>
inserted, respectively, into the external circuit connector.<br>
The external circuit connector 10, depicted in Figures 7 to 10, contains a chamber<br>
18, which contains cavities 11 and 12 into which element 1 and element 2, respectively, of<br>
the strip can be inserted. One or more wedge shaped projections 17 on the sidewalls of<br>
chamber 18 serve to separate strip elements 1 and 2 as the strip is inserted into chamber 18.<br>
As the strip is inserted into chamber 18, element 1 first strikes the lower face of projection<br>
17 and is forced down. This action in concert with the insertion action serves to further<br>
separate element 1 from element 2 to allow reliable insertion of element 2 into cavity 12.<br>
A further wedge-shaped projection protrudes from the rear face of chamber 18.<br>
Conducting layers are mounted on the faces 13 and 14 of this projection, wherein the two<br>
conducting layers are electrically insulated from one another. These layers make electrical<br>
contact with the conducting coatings on strip elements 1 and 2. Electrically conducting<br>
wires or other conducting tracks 15 and 16 are electrically connected to the conducting<br>
layers on faces 13 and 14 and serve to make connection to the external circuitry. As one<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate, the device with surfaces comprising conducting layers 13<br>
and 14 may be constructed so as to be integral with the projections 17.<br>
A second embodiment is depicted in Figures 11 to 13. Figure 11 shows a side view<br>
of the embodiment. Figures 12 and 13 show a side view of the embodiment with a strip<br>
partially or fully inserted respectively.<br>
The external circuit connector 100, depicted in Figures 11 to 13, contains a chamber<br>
105 which contains a wedge 101 that is able to rotate within the chamber 105 around the<br>
pivot point 102. The wedge comprises electrically conductive surfaces, 106 and 107 which<br>
are electrically connected to external connection points 103 and 104. In its initial position,<br>
the wedge 101 is held either by gravity or a spring tensioning device (not shown) such that<br>
it is positioned as shown in Figure 11. When a strip is inserted into the chamber 105, the<br>
lower electrode element strikes the lower surface of wedge 101 behind the pivot point 102.<br>
This action rotates wedge 101 such that the point of the wedge 101 is positioned between<br>
the upper and lower electrode layers of the strip. Then, as the strip is further inserted into<br>
chamber 105, the upper wedge surface 106 is brought into contact with the conducting<br>
coating on the upper strip element. Electrical connection of the conducting coating on the<br>
upper strip element to connection point 103, via conducting surface 106 is then achieved, as<br>
is electrical connection of the conducting coating on the lower electrode strip element to<br>
connection point 104 via conducting surface 107.<br>
The advantage of the embodiment shown in Figures 11 to 13 is that the point of the<br>
wedge 101 is automatically positioned between the upper and lower strip electrode<br>
elements to ensure reliable connection.<br>
Electrochemical cells<br>
The electrochemical cell connectors of preferred embodiments are suitable for use<br>
in a variety of electrochemical cells. For example, the connectors may be used in<br>
conjunction with electrochemical cells used as amperometric sensors for the detection and<br>
quantification of analytes.<br>
In such applications, the electrodes can be positioned such that the working<br>
electrode is isolated from the counter electrode reactions and reaction products, or<br>
positioned such that products of the counter electrode reaction diffuse to the working<br>
electrode where they react. The former type of electrochemical cell is well known in the<br>
prior art. The latter type of electrochemical cell is discussed in US 6,179,979 and US<br>
5,942,102.<br>
These two electrode configurations vary in that in the isolated case, the counter<br>
electrode is positioned far enough away from the working electrode such that during the<br>
time the cell is being used, products of electrochemical reactions at the counter electrode do<br>
not reach the working electrode. In practice, this is typically achieved by a separation of the<br>
working electrode from the counter electrode by at least a millimeter.<br>
In the non-isolated configuration, the working electrode and the counter electrode<br>
are placed close enough together such mat products of the electrochemical reactions at the<br>
counter electrode can diffuse to the working electrode during the time the cell is being used.<br>
These reaction products can then react at the working electrode, giving a higher current than<br>
may be present in the isolated electrode case. In the non-isolated configuration, the<br>
working electrode reactions can be described as coupled to the counter electrode reactions.<br>
Fabricating the Electrochemical Cell<br>
In certain embodiments, the electrochemical cells of preferred embodiments may be<br>
fabricated using methods similar to those disclosed in U.S. 5,942,102.<br>
As will be recognized by one skilled in the art, the electrode layers and electrically<br>
insulating substrates may be independently selected as desired, for example, for ease of<br>
fabrication, for reducing materials costs, or to achieve other desirable attributes of the cell<br>
or fabrication process. Likewise, the electrode layers may be applied to the layers of<br>
electrically insulating substrates in any suitable pattern, for example, a pattern that only<br>
partially covers the substrate.<br>
In preferred embodiments, various layers in the cell may be adhered using a suitable<br>
adhesive. Suitable adhesives include, for example, heat activated adhesives, pressure<br>
sensitive adhesives, heat cured adhesives, chemically cured adhesives, hot melt adhesives,<br>
hot flow adhesives, and the like. Pressure sensitive adhesives are preferred for use in<br>
certain embodiments where simplification of fabrication is desired. However, in other<br>
embodiments the tackiness of pressure sensitive adhesives may result in fabrication tool<br>
gumming or product tackiness. In such embodiments, heat or chemically cured adhesives<br>
are generally preferred. Especially preferred are the heat-activated and heat-cured<br>
adhesives, which can be conveniently activated at the appropriate time.<br>
In certain embodiments, it may be preferred to use a hot melt adhesive. A hot melt<br>
adhesive is a solvent-free thermoplastic material that is solid at room temperature and is<br>
applied in molten form to a surface to which it adheres when cooled to a temperature below<br>
its melting point. Hot melt adhesives are available in a variety of chemistries over a range<br>
of melting points. The hot melt adhesive can be in the form of a web, nonwoven material,<br>
woven material, powder, solution, or any other suitable form. Polyester hot melt adhesives<br>
may be preferred for certain embodiments. Such adhesives (available, for example, from<br>
Bostik Corp. of Middleton, MA) are linear saturated polyester hot melts exhibiting melting<br>
points from 65°C up to 220°C and range from completely amorphous to highly crystalline<br>
in nature. Polyamide (nylon) hot melt adhesives, also available from Bostik, may also be<br>
preferred, including both dimer-acid and nylon-type polyamide adhesives. Suitable hot<br>
melt adhesive chemistries include EVA, polyethylene, and polypropylene.<br>
Alternatively, in certain other embodiments it may be preferred to use lamination<br>
techniques to bond certain layers together. Suitable lamination techniques are described in<br>
Application No. 09/694,106 filed October 20, 2000 and Application No. 09/694,120 filed<br>
October 20,2000, each entitled "LAMINATES OF ASYMMETRIC MEMBRANES." The<br>
layers to be laminated are placed adjacent to each other and heat is applied, whereby a bond<br>
between the layers is formed. Pressure may also be applied to aid in forming the bond.<br>
Lamination methods may be preferred to bond any two materials capable of forming a bond<br>
under application of heat and/or pressure. Lamination is preferred to form a bond between<br>
two suitable polymeric materials.<br>
Suitable electrically resistive materials which may be preferred as spacer layers, as<br>
supports for electrode layers, or in other layers in the cell, include, for example, materials<br>
such as polyesters, polystyrenes, polycarbonates, polyolefins, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
glasses, ceramics, mixtures and/or combinations thereof, and the like. Examples of<br>
electrically resistive adhesives suitable for use as spacer or support layers include, but are<br>
not limited to, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates, polyurethanes, and sulfonated polyesters.<br>
Chemicals for use in the cell, such as redox reagents, lysing agents, buffers, inert<br>
salts, and other substances, may be supported on the cell electrodes or walls, on one or<br>
more independent supports contained within cell, or may be self supporting. If the<br>
chemicals are to be supported on the cell electrodes or walls, the chemicals may be applied<br>
by use of application techniques well known in the art, such as ink jet printing, screen<br>
printing, lithography, ultrasonic spraying, slot coating, gravure printing, and the like.<br>
Suitable independent supports may include, but are not limited to, meshes, nonwoven<br>
sheets, fibrous fillers, macroporous membranes, and sintered powders. The chemicals for<br>
use in the cell may be supported on or contained within a support.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the preferred materials within the cell as well as the<br>
materials from which the cell is constructed are in a form amenable to mass production, and<br>
the cells themselves are designed for a single experiment then disposed of. A disposable<br>
cell is one that is inexpensive enough to produce that it is economically acceptable only for<br>
a single test. A disposable cell is one that may conveniently only be used for a single test,<br>
namely, steps such as washing and/or reloading of reagents may need to be taken to process<br>
the cell after a single use to render it suitable for a subsequent use.<br>
Economically acceptable in this context means that the perceived value of the result<br>
of the test to the user is the same or greater than the cost of the cell to purchase and use, the<br>
cell purchase price being set by the cost of supplying the cell to the user plus an appropriate<br>
mark up. For many applications, cells having relatively low materials costs and simple<br>
fabrication processes are preferred. For example, the electrode materials of the cells may<br>
be inexpensive, such as carbon, or may be present in sufficiently small amounts such that<br>
expensive materials may be preferred. Screen printing carbon or silver ink is a process<br>
suitable for forming electrodes with relatively inexpensive materials. However, if it is<br>
desired to use electrode materials such as platinum, palladium, gold, or iridium, methods<br>
with better material utilization, such as sputtering or evaporative vapor coating, are<br>
preferred as they may yield extremely thin films. The substrate materials for the disposable<br>
cells are also preferably inexpensive. Examples of such inexpensive materials are polymers<br>
such as polyvinylchloride, polyimide, polyester and coated papers and cardboard.<br>
Cell assembly methods are preferably amenable to mass production. These methods<br>
include fabricating multiple cells on cards and separating the card into individual strips<br>
subsequent to the main assembly steps, and web fabrication where the cells are produced on<br>
a continuous web, which is subsequently separated into individual strips. Card processes<br>
are most suitable when close spatial registration of multiple features is desired for the<br>
fabrication and/or when stiff cell substrate materials are preferred. Web processes are most<br>
suitable when the down web registration of features is not as critical and flexible webs may<br>
be preferred.<br>
In certain embodiments, a convenient single use for the electrochemical cell may be<br>
desirable so that users are not tempted to try to reuse the cell and possibly obtain an<br>
inaccurate test result. Single use of the cell may be stated in user instructions<br>
accompanying the cell. More preferably, in certain embodiments where a single use is<br>
desirable the cell may be fabricated such that using the cell more than once is difficult or<br>
not possible. This may be accomplished, for example, by including reagents mat are<br>
washed away or consumed during the first test and so are not functional in a second test.<br>
Alternatively, the signal of the test may be examined for indications that reagents in the cell<br>
have already reacted, such as an abnormally high initial signal, and the test aborted.<br>
Another method includes providing a means for breaking electrical connections in the cell<br>
after the first test in a cell has been completed.<br>
The Electrodes<br>
In a preferred embodiment wherein the electrochemical cell detects the presence<br>
and/or amount of analyte in the sample, or a substance indicative of the presence and/or<br>
amount of analyte present in the sample, at least one of the electrodes in the cell is a<br>
working electrode. When the potential of the working electrode is indicative of the level of<br>
analyte (such as in a potentiometric sensor) a second electrode acting as reference electrode<br>
is present which acts to provide a reference potential.<br>
In the case of an amperometric sensor wherein the working electrode current is<br>
indicative of the level of an analyte, such as glucose, at least one other electrode is<br>
preferably present which functions as a counter electrode to complete the electrical circuit<br>
This second electrode may also function as a reference electrode. Alternatively, a separate<br>
electrode may perform the function of a reference electrode.<br>
Materials suitable for the working, counter, and reference electrodes are compatible<br>
with any reagents or substances present in the device. Compatible materials do not<br>
substantially react chemically with other substances present in the cell. Examples of such<br>
suitable materials may include, but are not limited to, carbon, carbon and an organic binder,<br>
platinum, palladium, carbon, indium oxide, tin oxide, mixed indium/tin oxides, gold, silver,<br>
iridium, and mixtures thereof. These materials may be formed into electrode structures by<br>
any suitable method, for example, by sputtering, vapor coating, screen printing, thermal<br>
evaporation, gravure printing, slot coating or lithography. In preferred embodiments, the<br>
material is sputtered or screen-printed to form the electrode structures.<br>
Non-limiting examples of materials preferred for use in reference electrodes include<br>
metal/metal salt systems such as silver in contact with silver chloride, silver bromide or<br>
silver iodide, and mercury in contact mercurous chloride or mercurous sulfate. The metal<br>
may be deposited by any suitable method and then brought into contact with the appropriate<br>
metal salt. Suitable methods include, for example, electrolysis in a suitable salt solution or<br>
chemical oxidation. Such metal/metal salt systems provide better potential control in<br>
potentiometric measurement methods than do single metal component systems. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the metal/metal salt electrode systems are preferred as a separate<br>
reference electrode in an amperometric sensor.<br>
Any suitable electrode spacing may be used. In certain embodiments it may be<br>
preferred that the electrodes be separated by a distance of about 500 µm, 400 µm, 300 µm,<br>
200 µm, 100 µm, 50 µm, 200 µm, 10 µm, or tess. In other embodiments it may be<br>
preferred that the electrodes be separated by a distance of about 500 µm, 600 µm, 700 µm,<br>
800 µm, 900 µm, 1 mm, or more.<br>
Lysing Agents<br>
In certain embodiments, it may be desired to include one or more lysing agents in<br>
the electrochemical cell. Suitable lysing agents include detergents, bom ionic and non-<br>
ionic, proteolytic enzymes, and lipases. Suitable ionic detergents include, for example,<br>
sodium dodecyl sulfate and cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. Non-limiting examples of<br>
proteolytic enzymes include trypsin, chymotrypsin, pepsin, papain, and Pronase E, a very<br>
active enzyme having broad specificity. Nonionic surfactants suitable for use include, for<br>
example, ethoxylated octylphenols, including the TRTTON X™ Series available from<br>
Rohm &amp; Haas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In a preferred embodiment, saponins,<br>
namely, plant glycosides that foam in water, are preferred as the lysing agent. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, alkali metal salts of deoxycholic acid, available from<br>
Sigma Aldrich Pty. Ltd. of Castle Hill, NSW, Australia, are preferred as lysing agents.<br>
Redox Reagent<br>
Redox reagents may also be included in the electrochemical cell in preferred<br>
embodiments. Preferred redox reagents for use in electrochemical cells for measuring<br>
glucose in blood include those which are capable of oxidizing the reduced form of enzymes<br>
that are capable of selectively oxidizing glucose. Examples of suitable enzymes include,<br>
but are not limited to, glucose oxidase dehydrogenase, PQQ dependent glucose<br>
dehydrogenase, and NAD dependent glucose dehydrogenase. Examples of redox reagents<br>
suitable for use in analyzing glucose include, but are not limited, to salts of ferricyanide,<br>
dichromate, vanadium oxides, permanganate, and electroactive organometallic complexes.<br>
Organic redox reagents such as dichlorophenolindophenol, and quinones are also suitable.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the redox reagent for analyzing glucose is ferricyanide.<br>
Buffers<br>
Optionally, a buffer may be present along with a redox reagent in dried form in the<br>
electrochemical cell. If a buffer is present, it is present in an amount such that the resulting<br>
pH level is suitable for adjusting the oxidizing potential of the redox reagent to a level<br>
suitable for oxidizing, for example, glucose but not other species that it is not desired to<br>
detect. The buffer is present in a sufficient amount so as to substantially maintain the pH of<br>
the sample at the desired level during the test. Examples of suitable buffers include<br>
phosphates, carbonates, alkali metal salts of mellitic acid, alkali metal salts of citric acid,<br>
and alkali metal salts of citraconic acid. The choice of buffer may depend, amongst other<br>
factors, on the desired pH. The buffer is selected so as not to react with the redox reagent.<br>
Inert Salts<br>
Inert salts preferred for use in various embodiments include salts that dissociate to<br>
form ions in the sample to be analyzed, but do not react with any of the redox reagents or<br>
other substances in the sample or in the cell, including with the cell electrodes. Examples<br>
of suitable inert salts include, but are not limited to, alkali metal chlorides, nitrates, sulfates,<br>
and phosphates.<br>
Other Substances Present Within the Cell<br>
In addition to redox reagents and buffers, other substances may also be present<br>
within the electrochemical cell. Such substances include, for example, viscosity enhancers<br>
and low molecular weight polymers. Hydrophilic substances may also be contained within<br>
the cell, such as polyethylene glycol, polyacrylic acid, dextran, and surfactants such as those<br>
marketed by Rohm &amp; Haas Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under the trade name<br>
TRITON™ or by ICI Americas Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware, under the trade name<br>
TWEEN™. In a preferred embodiment Pluronic surfactants and antifoaming agents<br>
available from BASF are present. Such substances may enhance the fill rate of the cell,<br>
provide a more stable measurement, and inhibit evaporation in small volume samples.<br>
Electrical Circuit<br>
The electrically conductive layers are preferably connected via the connectors<br>
described herein to electrical circuits capable of applying potentials between die electrodes<br>
and measuring the resulting currents, for example, meters. Suitable meters may include one<br>
or more of a power source, circuitry for applying controlled potentials or currents, a<br>
microprocessor control device, computer, or data storage device, a display device, an<br>
audible alarm device, or other devices or components as are known in the art. The meter<br>
may also be capable of being interfaced to a computer or data storage device. For example,<br>
a typical meter may be a hand-held device that is powered by a battery, controlled by an on-<br>
board microprocessor, and contains circuitry for applying predetermined potentials or<br>
currents between, for example, strip electrode connection pins and circuitry such as an<br>
analog-to-digital converter. In this embodiment, the analog signal from the strip may be<br>
converted to a digital signal that can be analyzed and/or stored by a microprocessor. The<br>
meter may also contain a display such as a Liquid Crystal Display and suitable associated<br>
circuitry to display the result of the test to the user. In an alternative embodiment, the meter<br>
may incorporate specialized circuitry, such as potential application and signal acquisition<br>
circuitry. Such specialized circuitry may be incorporated in a separate module that may be<br>
interfaced with a generic computing device, such as a hand-held computer or other type of<br>
computer. In such an embodiment, the generic device may perform the control, analysis,<br>
data storage, and/or display functions. Such an embodiment allows for a less expensive<br>
meter to be produced because the generic computing device may be preferred for many<br>
functions and as such is not considered as part of the cost of the electrochemical<br>
measurement system. In either of these meter embodiments, the meter or generic<br>
computing device may be capable of communication with external devices such as local<br>
computer networks or the Internet to facilitate the distribution of test results and the<br>
provision of system upgrades to the user.<br>
The above description provides several methods and materials of the present<br>
invention. This invention is susceptible to modifications in the methods and materials, as<br>
well as alterations in the fabrication methods and equipment. Such modifications will<br>
