FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method for realization of multifunction numerical line<br>
protection relay adopting a real-time operating system and a single processor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Transmission system is undergoing radical changes due to the introduction of numerical<br>
relays, SCADA and advance communication systems as a part of the substation<br>
automation. Numerical relays play an important role in the protection, control and<br>
monitoring of the transmission lines.<br>
Protective relaying is a vital part of any power system - quite unnecessary during<br>
normal operation, but very important during faults and abnormal disturbances. Properly<br>
applied protective relaying initiates the isolation of the faulty section, while operation<br>
and service in the rest of the system continue. Present power system is a complex<br>
network comprising of various<br><br>
power plants interconnected through transmission lines in a grid meeting<br>
the growing needs of industries.<br>
Conventionally, transmission lines are protected by electromechanical and<br>
electronic relaying systems which monitor the analog voltages and currents<br>
through various lines, via isolation transformers, for the purpose of<br>
detecting out-of-tolerance operating conditions. Such systems, receive and<br>
process the field data and achieve system reliability by having at least one<br>
independent protective relay dedicated to the protection of a single<br>
transmission line. This one-to-one correspondence between the protection<br>
hardware and the protectable equipment, when considering the many<br>
transmission lines of a large system to be protected, although ensures high<br>
reliability, but leads to a high cost protection system.<br>
The growing complexity of network in the transmission lines, lead to<br>
complicated phenomena of system faults. Thus, it is essential to achieve<br>
an optimization of various protection functions including a highly graded<br>
protective performance along with high speed and greater accuracy in<br>
order to isolate the faulty section from the rest.Such a requirement entails<br>
high-speed processing of large amount of data by adopting several<br><br>
algorithms . Large amount of data also needs to be shared on the network.<br>
In order to achieve a superior protective performance, higher speed and<br>
greater accuracy, the processing functions need to be graded and<br>
prioritized suitably.<br>
In general, numerical line protection relays are well known. In recent<br>
years, a digital relay has been developed as a protective relay for a power<br>
system to process voltage and current signal data, sampled at regular time<br>
intervals to detect a system fault and thus to protect the system.<br>
A few related examples can be found in the earlier patents mentioned<br>
below:<br>
1) US PATENT NO.5428553 Dt. June 27,1995<br>
Title : DIGITAL CONTROL AND PROTECTION EQUIPMENT FOR POWER<br>
SYSTEM<br>
In accordance with this invention, a power signal processing system and a<br>
related system is based on a multiprocessor system, with processing<br>
means optimally distributed into a plurality of units according to respective<br>
processing functions. A power signal processing system and method for<br><br>
protection of a power system has a signal input unit for receiving a signal<br>
representing a condition of a power system; a plurality of processing units<br>
cooperating to apply to the received signal a predetermined process<br>
including a series of predetermined different computations thereby<br>
producing a control signal for controlling operation of the power signal<br>
processing system. The respective processing units operate to perform the<br>
predetermined different computations, respectively. A control unit is<br>
provided for controlling transfer of data among the processing units so that<br>
the different computations are applied, successively, to the received signal<br>
thereby producing the control signal which is used to cause, for example,<br>
the issue of a cut-off command to a circuit breaker.<br>
The drawback of this invention is that several digital signal processing units<br>
are required, thereby making the system costly as well as robust.<br>
2. KOREAN PATENT NO. KR20020031066 Dt. April 26,2002<br>
TITLE : SEPARATION OF PROTECTION AND AUTOMATION FUNCTIONS IN<br>
PROTECTIVE RELAY FOR POWER SYSTEMS<br>
This invention relates generally to protection and automation control<br>
functions for power systems, and more particularly concerns a system for<br>
providing separation between the protection and automation functions in a<br><br>
single apparatus. Separation of protection and automation functions in a<br>
protective relay for power systems is provided to achieve a single system<br>
for both protection and automation control, while maintaining the<br>
autonomy and separation between the specific control portions of the<br>
protection and automation functions.<br>
This invention discusses about having a single system for both protection<br>
and automation control, while maintaining the autonomy and separation<br>
between the specific control portions (logic equations) of the protection<br>
and automation functions, as well as separate output contact control in<br>
some cases. While the protection logic equations can be modified by a user<br>
having first password, the automation logic equations can be modified by<br>
another user having access to the second password.<br>
Here, the disadvantage is that the user is allowed to tamper with<br>
protection logic equations along with the automation logic equations. In<br>
the case of protection relays with high complexity of protection logic built<br>
into it for failsafe operation, it is not advisable to let user change the<br>
protection logic.<br><br>
3.	US PATENT NO. US6789001Dt. Sep 7,2004<br>
TITLE : DIGITAL MULTIFUNCTION RELAY<br>
This invention relates to a digital multifunction relay having a digital signal<br>
processor in conjunction with a microcontroller for controlling one or more<br>
protection devices of a power distribution network from fault events. The<br>
foreground activity of the digital signal processor is to convert the analog<br>
signals into sampled values and processing said sampled values to obtain<br>
predefined calculated values suitable for controlling said protection devices;<br>
and<br>
generating control signals which regulate an operating state of said<br>
protection devices. The foreground and background activity is controlled by<br>
the microcontroller.<br>
4.	US PATENT NO.5,224,011 Dt. Jun.29, 1993<br>
TITLE : MULTIFUNCTION PROTECTIVE RELAY SYSTEM<br>
This invention is about the relay system which includes a dual processing<br>
architecture wherein a digital signal processor executes all the signal-<br>
processing algorithms, and a separate microprocessor is used for<br>
input/output data processing. A dual-ported RAM is used to effect a fast<br>
communication link between the digital signal processor and the<br><br>
microprocessor to accomplish high-speed protective relaying functions to<br>
selectively trip and close a circuit breaker at a generator or cogenerator<br>
site, or that which connects it to an electric utility system.<br>
The limitation of the methodology discussed in 1,2,3,4 is that all of them<br>
are based on more than one processor, either a DSP with a microcontroller<br>
/ microprocessor or with several DSPs together.<br>
5. US PATENT NO.4,636,909 Dt. Janl3, 1987<br>
TITLE : DIGITAL IMPEDANCE RELAY<br>
This invention relates to a device for digitally detecting an impedance<br>
below a set value. The incoming voltage and current signals are converted<br>
in a A/D converter, filtered and rectified to deliver an output signal via<br>
summators when the measured impedance is lower than the set<br>
impedance value.<br>
The method discussed here is about a single parameter - distance<br>
measurement as a basis for identification of fault, which is a limitation in<br>
the present scenario of complex networks.<br><br>
6.	US PATENT NO. 4,689,709 Dt. Aug 25, 1987<br>
TITLE: DIGITAL DISTANCE RELAY<br>
The invention relates to a digital distance relay which requires only 2N (N:<br>
number of phases on duty) per sampling of distance measuring operations.<br>
Here, the distance measuring operation is performed only regarding the<br>
phase on duty in third step, if there is no fault, and it is performed<br>
regarding either the third and first steps or the third and second steps, if a<br>
fault is detected within third step. Thereby the processing time for the<br>
distance measuring operation is reduced to two steps per sampling.<br>
The method discussed here is about a single parameter - distance<br>
measurement as a basis for identification of fault, which is a limitation in<br>
the present scenario of complex networks.<br>
7.	US PATENT NO. 4,344,143 Dt. Aug 10,1982<br>
TITLE: DIGITAL TYPE DISTANCE RELAY SYSTEM<br>
This invention relates to a digital distance relay system, which can reliably<br>
determine whether or not to protect the power transmission system at the<br><br>
time of occurrence of a fault in the power system. It caters to a single<br>
protection function of line protection.<br>
The limitation of the methodologies discussed in 5,6,7 is that it is difficult<br>
to meet the present day demands on a multifunction line protection relay<br>
to not only detect a fault based on impedance parameter alone, but also<br>
perform several other protection functions before deciding on the operation<br>
of the breaker.<br>
8. JP PATENT NO. 1077415 Dt. March 23, 1989<br>
TITLE: DIGITAL PROTECTING RELAY<br>
This invention relates a method to obtain multifunction protective relay<br>
unlimited by the scale of a function, by increasing the number of CPU units<br>
according to the scale of the function.<br>
Here too, the methodology is to increase the number of CPU units as the<br>
complexity rises, which would ultimately increase the size of the unit.<br>
Thus, a conventional digital relay consists of a Central Processing Unit<br>
(CPU) and the associated digital circuitry, where one or several functions<br><br>
are performed in time division multiplexing mode. In this type of relay, the<br>
limitation is in the processing ability of the processing section which may<br>
not be able to meet the enormous data processing requirements.<br>
In order to circumvent the above mentioned problem, several relays are<br>
being proposed with two or more processors, thereby segregating the<br>
processing load and attempt to meet the high speed performance. In some<br>
cases, while the data acquisition is managed by a Digital Signal Processor<br>
(DSP), the rest of the protection and control functions are being managed<br>
by a microcontroller or a microprocessor or a DSP. The limitation of this<br>
method is that the main processor is made to handle both the protection<br>
and control functions, and also slow processes such as serial<br>
communication over RS232 and MODBUS communications over RS485,<br>
thereby loading the processor.<br>
Increasing demands upon protection relays for higher level services like<br>
high speed and accurate protection along with networking, user interfaces<br>
and file system management, are driving growth in fully-featured<br>
configuration. A critical issue is efficient integration of custom hardware<br>
and software resources, where efficiency must be considered in terms of<br><br>
both design time and run time. The prior art available does not answer this<br>
issue.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore, an object of the invention to provide a single processor<br>
architecture with a real-time operating system that is designed for<br>
scheduling the multiple tasks in order to protect the transmission line by<br>
means of a multifunction numerical line protection relay, so as to achieve a<br>
significant increase in the processing capability.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for line fault<br>
detection by adopting a numerical line protection relay which provides task<br>
scheduling and prioritizing the tasks for the protection and control.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a method for transmission<br>
line fault detection by adopting a multifunction numerical line protection<br>
relay based on determination of current and voltage parameters in a single<br>
central processing unit (CPU) in combination with a real time operating<br><br>
system, thereby eliminating the need of using dual processor with / without<br>
Digital Signal Processor (DSP).<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method for line fault<br>
detection by adopting a multifunction numerical line protection relay which<br>
is cost-effective and functionally reliable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

for data sharing. More particularly, the invention relates to a method for<br>
transmission line protection by means of a multifunction numerical line<br>
protection relay.<br>
The present invention relates to a method used in multifunction numerical<br>
line protection relays, based on a single processor system with the<br>
processing load optimally distributed into several threads and tasks and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Referring now to Fig.l, the multifunction numerical line protection relay<br>
incorporating the present invention, is a powerful and compact<br>
multifunction numerical relay, configured for the protection of transmission<br>
lines. The relay is capable of handling the protection requirements of the<br>
transmission lines, and works based on the three phase currents and<br>
voltages.<br>
The entire application software is divided into real and non-real time tasks<br>
wherein the real time tasks are repeated exactly with the same cyclicity as<br><br>
has been originally defined by the application. The non-real tasks on the<br>
other hand, are not time critical and run in the background. The real time<br>
tasks are handled by the RT module while the non-real time tasks are<br>
handled by NRT module. The relay software is designed and implemented<br>
such that it supports many features.<br>
It uses RT FIFOs (real time first in first out) as Inter Process<br>
Communication (IPC) mechanism for communication between RT module<br>
and NRT module and it lies in kernel memory space. They act as pipes<br>
between the RT and NRT tasks.<br>
As relay software needs to keep on sampling voltages and currents<br>
periodically, using a real time operating system is very advantageous. It<br>
provides system calls to schedule the execution of our code to a precision<br>
of few tenths of micro seconds. And the RT programs are inserted into the<br>
kernel, like other kernel modules, while they are executed, so even direct<br>
access to hardware is also possible. This will increase the performance of<br>
the software.<br><br>
Another advantage is that the programs can be multithreaded so that the<br>
protection functions are executed periodically without interruption even<br>
while communicating with external interfaces, eg. changing the setting<br>
through serial link which is usually slow. It is not possible without the<br>
multithreading feature. Also operating system uses dual kernel technology<br>
making it possible to execute both real time programs and non-real time<br>
programs on the same microprocessor. It also provides good Inter Process<br>
Communication (IPC) mechanisms between real time programs and non-<br>
real time programs.<br>
The multifunction line protection relay of the invention is configured to<br>
perform the following protection and non protection functions :<br>
PROTECTION FEATURES<br>
1. Phase and earthfault distance protection: Each with five independent<br>
zones of protection, four in the forward and one in the reverse<br>
direction. This is based on impedance measurement, which is high<br>
during the normal operation, and, during fault condition, the<br>
impedance becomes less, and when it is below the set value, trip<br>
command to the breaker is issued to isolate the faulty time.<br><br>
2.	Overcurrent protection: Two elements with direction control, with<br>
first element as either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or<br>
Definite Time (DT) and the second element as Hiset instantaneous.<br>
This is provided to limit damage from phase faults.<br>
3.	Earthfault protection: Two elements with directional control, with first<br>
element as either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or Definite<br>
Time (DT) and the second element as Hiset instantaneous. This is a<br>
protection scheme with the zero sequence component of the three<br>
phase currents.<br>
4.	Overvoltage protection: One element with selectable characteristics<br>
as either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or definite time (DT)<br>
for each of the three phase voltages.<br>
5.	Undervoltage protection: One element with selectable characteristics<br>
as either Inverse Definite Minimum Time (IDMT) or definite time (DT)<br>
for each of three phase voltages.<br>
6.	Negative sequence overcurrent protection. This element can provide<br>
backup protection for many unbalanced fault conditions.<br>
7.	Switch on to fault (SOTF) protection: This is provided for high speed<br>
clearance of any detected fault immediately after a manual circuit<br>
breaker closure.<br><br>
8.	Trip on reclose protection (TOR): This is provided for high speed<br>
clearance of any detected fault immediately following autoreclose of<br>
the circuit breaker.<br>
9.	Power swing blocking: Selective blocking of distance protection zones<br>
ensures stability during power swings experienced on transmission<br>
systems.<br><br>
10.	Voltage transformer supervision: This is to prevent wrong<br>
operation of voltage dependent protection on AC voltage input. It<br>
mainly detects voltage transformer fuse failures.<br>
11.	Current transformer supervision: If one or any of the current<br>
transformers were to become open circuited, this protection raises an<br>
alarm.<br>
12.	Broken conductor: This is to detect network faults such as open<br>
circuits, where a conductor may be disconnected and not in contact<br>
with another conductor or the earth.<br>
13.	Circuit breaker failure protection: Whenever the circuit breaker<br>
at protected terminal fails to trip, this protection would then send a<br>
command to upstream circuit breaker to backtrip.<br><br>
NON-PROTECTION FEATURES<br>
1.	Autorecloser with checksynchronism: This provides upto 4 reclose<br>
shots, with checksynchronism for voltage, frequency and phase, and<br>
can be set for any combination of line and bus conditions.<br>
2.	Distance to fault locator.<br>
3.	Measurements of field data and computation of derived parameters<br>
are available for display at the relay as well as accessed from the<br>
serial communication facility.<br>
4.	Event / Fault / Disturbance Records.<br>
The program continuously monitors to determine the status of the<br>
associated transmission line, in real time. This provides information related<br>
to the line conditions and whether any alarms or trips are issued by the<br>
relay.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the relay connected to the transmission line for monitoring<br>
the current and voltages in real-time. The field inputs viz. three phase<br>
currents, the three phase voltages and the busbar voltage are connected to<br>
the relay terminal blocks. The relay contacts operate the circuit breaker<br>
(52), which is connected to the relay terminal blocks.<br><br>
Fig.2 shows a block diagram of the hardware of the system. The relay<br>
hardware comprises of seven modules. The auxiliary D.C. voltage given to<br>
the relay is first stepped down to 24Vdc in module no. 1. This voltage<br>
energizes module no. 2, module no. 5 and module no. 7. The +15Vdc and<br>
-15Vdc is used to energize module no. 3 and module no. 4.<br>
The field inputs viz. three phase currents and the three phase voltages<br>
(described in Fig.l ), connected to the relay terminal blocks, are first<br>
processed by module no. 3. The stepped down signals are then filtered by<br>
module no. 4 for any high frequency disturbances and anti-aliasing errors.<br>
These signals are then sent to section B of module no. 2.<br>
The module no. 2 has the relay algorithm residing in section C. When the<br>
module is powered ON, the program control after necessary hardware and<br>
software memory initializations, first digitizes the analog data in section B,<br>
and processes the data checking for any fault. When a fault occurs, the<br>
relay senses it and issues a command in the form an annunciation or a trip,<br>
depending upon the severity of the fault. The final relay outputs are sent<br>
through section D to the module no. 5. This module with its sixteen<br>
numbers of contacts has a higher driving capability and these potential free<br><br>
contacts are brought out to relay terminal blocks (described in Fig. 1).<br>
Relay status is indicated by means of lamps provided on the front side of<br>
the panel. In addition, alarms and trip contacts are brought out in the<br>
form of potential-free contacts, which can, in turn, be used for either<br>
operating the circuit breaker or to drive audio / visual alarm. The contacts<br>
and lamps are of self resetting type.<br>
The module no.2 also has two serial ports RS232- section F, through which<br>
the metered data is communicated to the operator interface on the front of<br>
the relay (module 7) and also to the PC-based HMI (Human machine<br>
interface) program (module 6). It can also read the set parameters from<br>
the operator interface.<br>
The section G comprises of two RS485 ports which facilitates the multi<br>
drop communication features of the relay when using MODBUS protocol.<br>
The section E is the 100 Mbps Ethernet port that is available on the relay<br>
for communication over Ethernet.<br><br>
FUNCTION OF THE RT AND NRT MODULES AND THEIR<br>
INTECONNECTIVITY<br>
The present invention incorporates the concept of multithreading used in<br>
the relay and is described in Fig.3, Fig.4 and Fig.5. Both the real time<br>
tasks as well as the non-real time tasks are handled by the relay software<br>
and the communication between them is through RT FIFOs.<br>
Description of Fig. 3: This figure describes the overall design of the relay<br>
software by means of a Data Flow Diagram. The RT module handles real<br>
time operations regarding data acquisition through A/D interrupts for<br>
analog signals, and also the digital signals, processes them and handles<br>
control of the circuit breaker and other digital controls. The data that needs<br>
to be shared with the NRT module is placed in the memory (RT FIFOs) that<br>
can be accessed by the NRT module. The NRT module handles the serial<br>
communications with the environment, stores the data made available by<br>
the RT module in data files. It handles the metering data, event, fault,<br>
disturbance, oscillography data and the relay switch settings data.<br><br>
Description of Fig. 4: This figure illustrates the various real time threads by<br>
means of the data flow diagram. There are three threads, viz. RTthreadl,<br>
RTthread2, RTthread3. RTthreadl has the highest priority and is<br>
programmed to wake up every 277 microseconds. On waking up, this<br>
thread completes the tasks and goes to sleep. RTthread2 which has the<br>
next lower priority level, is programmed to wake up every 833<br>
microseconds (three times that of RTthreadl). RTthread3 has the least<br>
priority and scheduled to be executed every 1 second. This thread gets to<br>
be active only when the other tasks in the higher two threads are<br>
completed, and the processor is idle. The load in each of the thread is<br>
distributed in such a way that all the tasks are executed in a easy manner<br>
without any loss of data. The rate of sampling as done by the RTthreadl is<br>
3600 samples per second. This is very much essential for accurate fault<br>
identification, location, proper regeneration of the waveform when<br>
oscillography / disturbance recording is considered and for the computation<br>
of the derived parameters. But for performing the protection functions, this<br>
high rate of periodicity is not necessary. If even the protection is done at<br>
this high rate the burden on the processor will increase unnecessarily. So it<br>
is better to run the protection functions at a slower rate i.e. in the second<br>
thread. The RT thread2 runs periodically 1200 times a second, and calls<br><br>
the protection functions with the same rate. This is exactly l/3rd of the rate<br>
of sampling done at the RT thread 1.<br>
The RT thread 1 is the highest priority thread. And this thread runs<br>
periodically once in every 277 microseconds. The tasks in this thread which<br>
sample all the seven input signals ie. three voltages, three currents and the<br>
busbar voltage from the field.<br>
The second thread, RTthread2, calls all the functions needed for the<br>
protection and other algorithms. Other derived parameters viz. the<br>
frequency of the signal, impedances of each phase, active power and<br>
reactive power, phase angles between the currents and voltages etc. are<br>
also calculated here and used in the algorithms.<br>
The third thread, RT thread 3, is used for properly communicating with the<br>
NRT module through FIFOs. It sends the metering data to the NRT module<br>
once in every 1 second. Reading from and writing to the RT-FIFOs is<br>
completely taken care of, by this thread. As explained before, the relay<br>
settings are also brought to RT module form the NRT module via an RT<br>
FIFO dedicated for this purpose. The records of data for the events, faults<br>
and disturbances are also updated in the respective RT FIFOs.<br><br>
The scheduling time and synchronization of the three threads is shown in<br>
the Fig. 8.<br>
Description of Fig. 5: This diagram depicts the data flow in the NRT<br>
software. The data accessed from the shared memory i.e. through RTFIFOs<br>
is managed by the NRT module. The front-panel display and keypad<br>
functions are handled through the serial port. These functions include - the<br>
data to be displayed (viz. metering, event, fault, disturbance records) and<br>
the data to be read and updated during the modification of the relay<br>
switch settings. Similarly, the PC based GUI software can be accessed over<br>
another serial port. Other devices and relays can also be connected to the<br>
RS485 ports for multidrop communication. All these tasks are slow and are<br>
handled by the NRT thread which is not time critical and gets executed<br>
during the idle time of the processor.<br>
Fig. 6 and 7 show the recording of the RTThreadl, RTThread2 switching<br>
time. The logic 'high' of each of waveform depicts the thread busy time.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the timing and synchronization between the three threads.<br>
Fig. 9 is the record showing the waking up of RTThread2 by the signal<br>
from RTThreadl.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE FLOWCHARTS<br>
Fig. 10 shows the procedural design of the RT module with the three<br>
real time threads.<br>
Step 1: When powered ON, the program first initializes the operating<br>
system.<br>
Step 2: Next is the initialization of all the memory variables of section C<br>
in Fig.2, and the A/D - section B of Fig.2.<br>
Step 3: Creation of the real time threads takes place here.<br>
Step 4: This is an event loop handler that allows the program to<br>
suspend until it receives an exit signal from the user or system.<br>
Step 5: Here, the cancellation and joining of threads take place.<br>
Step 6: Before the application is terminated, all the initialized memory<br>
and RTFIFOs are released.<br>
Step 7: Termination of the application program.<br>
Step 8: Waking up of RTThreadl for the execution of the tasks. Upon<br>
completion, it goes to sleep.<br>
Step 9: When RTthreadl goes to sleep and the timer for this thread<br>
gets activated, RTThread2 wakes up to execute the tasks assigned.<br>
Upon completion, it goes to sleep.<br><br>
Step 10: RTThread3 wakes up every 1 second to perform the tasks<br>
assigned to this thread. If any of the higher priority tasks viz.<br>
RTThreadl or the RTThread2 wakes up, it will preempt the task, switch<br>
to the higher priority thread, finish the tasks and resume from where it<br>
left. Upon finishing the tasks, this thread would go to sleep.<br>
Fig. 11 shows the procedural flowcharts of RTThreadl, RTThread2 and<br>
RTThread3<br>
Step 1 shows the waking up and beginning of RTThreadl.<br>
Step 2 shows the functions performed by RTThreadl. The data<br>
acquisition, digital filtering routine, computation of metered and derived<br>
parameters and storing of data for records is done here.<br>
Step 3 is the termination and going to sleep of RTThreadl.<br>
Step 4 shows the waking up and beginning of RTThread2.<br>
Step 5 shows the functions performed by RTThread2. The protection<br>
algorithms for the various functions are processed here. The circuit<br>
breaker control is also performed here.<br>
Step 6 shows the non-protection algorithms being processed by<br>
RThread2.<br>
Step 7 is the termination and going to sleep of RTThread2.<br><br>
Step 8 shows the waking up and beginning of RTThreacB.<br>
Step 9 shows the functions performed by RTThread3. The writing of the<br>
RTFIFOs with measurement values, event, fault and disturbance<br>
records, and reading of the RTFIFO for the updated switch settings and<br>
relay parameters is executed here.<br>
Step 10 is the termination and going to sleep of RTThread3.<br><br>
