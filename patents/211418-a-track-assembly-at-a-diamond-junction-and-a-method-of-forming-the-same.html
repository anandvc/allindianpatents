THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
19-10-2005<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to a train track assembly at intersections.<br>
In particular, this invention relates to a train track assembly at diamond crossings.<br>
Description of Prior Art: Introduction:<br>
Train tracks are usually laid parallel to each other at predetermined distances. These tracks are classified as Main Rail line track and Yard/side Rail line track. The Main rail line track is mainly used for fast moving passenger trains. The Yard/side rail line is usually used for goods-carrying trains or yard going trains. However it is not always possible to lay parallel non-intersecting tracks. In such a situation track intersections are useful.<br>
The two known track intersections or crossings are:<br>
1.	Scissor or Crossover junction/intersection.<br>
2.	Diamond Crossing.<br>
In a scissor or crossover junction/intersection a branch line rail track called as sub or Yard track emerges out of the main line track. Hence one main line divides into two sub lines.<br>
In a diamond crossing two different tracks intersect at some angle to each other. Hence two lines come in and two lines go out after the crossing. The portion where the tracks cross each other is in the shape of a diamond, hence such a track intersection is also known as a 'diamond crossing'.<br>
Such scissor or crossover junction/intersection, if provided with slips/switches serves two purposes, one of switching the train to the intermediate line or simply crossing and the other of diverting the train to the adjacent line.<br><br>
The traditional design of a diamond crossing involves the discontinuity of the rail table and an unguided flange travel. The passage of the trains over such a diamond crossing necessitates that the speed of the trains be reduced and limited within 10-15kmph from the safety point. On account of the discontinuity of the rail table and unguided flange, neither the tread nor the flange of the wheel that is in contact with the track at the diamond crossing is supported thereby increasing the chances of derailment. The discontinuity also necessitates that the speed of the train on the main line as well as the yard line be reduced.<br>
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates the track layout at a diamond crossing according to the prior art. The main rail line (20) and the yard rail line (21) are discontinuous at the diamond crossing. At the portion of the track (23) where the wheel of the train passes the diamond crossing, both the wheel tread and the wheel flange are unsupported. The main rail line (20) and the yard rail line (21) are bolted to the metal support plates (22).<br>
These diamond crossings require to be specially fabricated as per special layouts unique for each cross over location. Such diamond crossings invariably involve totally unsupported wheel tread and unguarded wheel flange. The rail wheel is not sufficiently supported across the sub junctions of the diamond crossing due to which the wheel drops into the gap and is then lifted to the usual height of the yard rail line leading to jerks and resulting in heavy hammering action on the support components. This heavy hammering action results in snapping of bolts, battering of rail ends and fracturing of rails at nose portion for both the main line and the yard line. Heavy hammering damages the wooden sleepers and also loosens the packing. Therefore such diamond crossings require heavy maintenance and frequent replacement of components.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,015,805 discloses a railway switch or crossing for transferring railway vehicles from a main track to a side track and, respectively, crossing of a side track with a main track, the switch or crossing comprising a frog in which the rail of the main track is uninterrupted.<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,354,018 discloses an apparatus for switching a railroad car wheel from a first rail to a second rail including a base and a ramp member. The ramp member is hinged to the base.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,531,049 discloses a bolted rail railroad frog designed to support a railroad wheel to roll through the frog on its flange rather than requiring its tread to jump across a flangeway gap.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,538,182 discloses a railroad grade crossing system includes an integral concrete pad that has a pair of spaced-apart cavities located in its upper surface.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,746,400 discloses a railroad trackwork rail crossing having four rail intersection comers is comprised, at each comer, of four comer casting elements which have angled platforms, co-operating straight intermediate rail elements, co-operating straight guard rail elements, cooperating straight traffic rail elements, and bolt fasteners joining the casting and rail elements into a rigid unitary rail crossing structure.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,765,785 discloses an improved standard crossing for railroad track is provided, having an interchangeable insert.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,988,519 discloses a precast concrete curved grade crossing includes a plurality of base members, each of which has a central recess formed in the upper surface.<br>
An object of this invention is to eliminate the discontinuity in the main line thereby allowing the train on the main line to pass the diamond crossing at a higher speed. Another object of this invention is to overcome the limitations of the prior art and to provide means for allowing the wheel of a train on the yard line to fly over the main rail line track.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a flange supported movement when the wheel is on the diamond crossing.<br><br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The present invention envisages a method of laying track at a diamond crossing in such a way that there is no discontinuity in the main rail.<br>

Detailed description of the invention:<br>
The present invention will now be explained with reference to the figures 2 to 11 of the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 2 and Figure 3 illustrate the overview of a diamond crossing incorporating the present invention. The main rail track (30) is unbroken and kept continuous while the yard rail track is discontinuous at the diamond crossing and comprises three sections (31), (37) and (44) respectively. The main rail track (30) and the yard rail line track are respectively provided with checkrails (34) and (35). The checkrails (34) and (35) support the tread of the train wheel. At the diamond crossing the main rail line track (30) and the yard rail line track section (31), (37) and (44) are fitted onto metal reinforcing plates (32). The metal reinforcing plates (32) bare the strain that is applied on the tracks. The metal plates (32) are further supported by external reinforcing members (33).<br>
The external reinforcing members (33) ensure that there is no movement of the metal reinforcing plates. The rail tracks are laid onto wooden sleepers (38) and are also used to support the part of the tracks at the diamond junction that is not supported by the metal plates (32). The angle at which the main rail line track (30) and the yard rail line track<br><br><br>
sections (31), (37) and (44) are laid, are such that at least one wheel of the wheel set is always supported at the tread. The metal plates (32) are either rectangular in shape or specially designed such that maximum portion of the yard rail line track sections (33), (37) and (44) at a sub junction can be accommodated.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates sectional front view of the yard rail line track. As the train rides over the yard rail line track the tread of the rail wheel (40) is supported on the yard rail line track. Figure 5 illustrates the sectional front view of the first section (37) of the yard rail line track and the check rail (35) of the yard rail line track section. As the train approaches the diamond junction check rail (35) is provided to the each section of the yard rail line track and the main rail line track (30). The check rail (35) cooperates with the yard rail line track sections and support the tread (45) and the flange (46) of the rail wheels (40).<br>
Figure 6 illustrates the sectional front view of the first yard rail line track section (37) and check rail (35) of the yard rail line track and the cooperating ramp member (36). The ramp member (36) provides for the rail wheel (40) on the first yard rail line track section (37) to fly over the main rail line track (30). As the train approaches the sub junction of the rail wheel (40) goes up the ramp member (36). As the wheel goes up the ramp member (36), the tread support to the rail wheel (40) is progressively decreases. At the sub junction the movement of the rail wheel (40) is flange supported.<br>
The ramp member (36), the yard rail line track section (37) and the check rail (35) are fitted together by means of a nut and a bolt. The ramp member (36) either extends from the yard rail line track section (37) or overlaps the yard rail line track section (37) it can also be an integral part of the yard rail line track section (37).<br>
Figure 7 illustrates the exploded side view of the sub junction of the main rail line track (30) and the first yard rail line track section (37). At the sub junction the main rail line track (30) and the first yard rail line track section (37) are placed on metal plates (32). The ramp member (36) cooperating with the first yard rail line track section (37) is fitted such that the main rail line track (30) and the operative inclined surface of the ramp member (36) are in aligned engagement with each other. The yard rail line track section (37) abuts the main rail<br><br><br>
line track (30). Metal plates (32) and (53) are used as means for elevating the yard rail line track section (37) relative to the main rail line track (30) such that the clearance between the yard rail line track section (37) and the main rail line track (30) which is about 30mm can precisely accommodate the rail wheel flange so as to ensure a smooth motion of the rail wheel over the main rail line track (30).<br>
Figure 8A illustrates the sectional front view of the yard rail line track section (37) with the rail wheel (40) riding over the rail. The movement of the rail wheel (40) is a tread supported movement. Figure 8B illustrates the sectional front view of the yard rail line track section (37) along with the check rail (35) and the cooperating ramp member (36). As the train approaches a sub junction the rail wheel (40) is gradually lifted up. The movement of the rail wheel (40) is a tread and flange supported movement. Figure 8C illustrates the sectional front view of the yard rail line track section (37) and the check rail (35) and the cooperating ramp member. When the rail wheel is at the top of the ramp member (36) the tread (45) of the rail wheel (40) is no longer supported the movement is entirely a flange supported movement. Figure 8D illustrates the sectional front view of the yard rail line track section (37) and the check rail (35) along with the cooperating ramp member (36). At the sub junction the operative inclined surface of the ramp member (36) is aligned with the main rail line track (30). As the rail wheel (40) rides over the main rail line track (30) it brushes past the operative surface of the main rail line track (30). The movement of the rail wheel (40) over the main rail line track (30) is only flange supported.<br>
Figure 9 illustrates the exploded view of a sub junction of the main rail line track (30) and yard rail line track section (37) and the movement of the rail wheel (40) along the sub junction. The nose portion of the ramp member (36) exactly fits into the recess of the main rail line track (30). Before the train approaches the sub junction the rail wheel (40) on the yard rail line track section (37) is tread supported. As the rail wheel (40) approaches the sub junction the rail wheel (40) gradually goes up the ramp member (36) and is lifted of the yard rail track section (37) and the support to the tread of the rail wheel (40) progressively decreases. At the top of the ramp member (36) the rail wheel (40) is only flange supported. As the rail wheel (40) brushes past the main rail line track (30) is continues to be supported at the flange.<br><br><br>
Figure 10 illustrates the general overview of the rail wheel movement at the each of the sub junctions of the diamond crossing. The first yard rail line track section (37) abuts the one rail of the pair of main rail line track (30) at one sub junction. A gap of 44mm exists between the ramp member (36) at one end of the second yard rail line track section (44) and the main rail line track (30). The ramp member at the other side of the second rail line track section (44) abuts the second rail of the main rail line track (30) at the other sub junction. A gap of 44mm exists between the ramp member (36) at the third yard rail line track section (31) and the main rail line track (30). As the rail wheel (40) goes up the ramp member (36), the tread support to the rail wheel (40) progressively decreases. At the sub junction the rail flange is supported and the tread support progressively increases as the rail wheel (40) comes down the ramp. While flying over the gap, the wheels of the train (40) brush past the main rail line track (30), due to which a small depression is created.<br>
14mm plates (53) are used as a means for elevating the yard rail line track sections (37) and (44) relative to the main rail line track (30). The yard rail line track sections (37) and (44) are elevated by using rail track sections which are of greater height as compared to the main rail line track (30). The yard rail line track section (37) and (44) are elevated relative to the main rail line track (30) such that the clearance between the yard rail line track section (37) and (44) and the main rail line track (30) is about 30mm so that the flange of the wheel can be precisely accommodated.<br>
Figure 11A and 11B illustrate the side view and top view of the ramp member (36), which is fastened to the yard rail line track members (31). On the side of the ramp member (36) two holes (42) are provided to accommodate fastening equipments such a bolts. The angle at which rail tracks are laid at the diamond crossing ensure that at all time one wheel of the wheel set is always supported at the tread and the flange.<br>
