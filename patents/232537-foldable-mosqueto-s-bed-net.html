				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Foldable mosqueto's bed net is  a invented device by using It can protect from the harm full insects e.g mosquetoes. Mosqueto is one of the dangrous insect which snread deadly decease. There is no such device in the market which prevent from the moscueto's bite in ppen places. So this  foldable mosqueto bed net is developed for the safty from the insect bite. This device not only open manuly and automaticaly but also it can be use on the floor too. In the traditional way the bed net is fixed with the help of rods to tie up with and remove the rods when not in use. But this inventedxris device there is no need of rods to fix it because it has its own structure which give shane automatacally when it opens.<br>
BACK GROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In the traditional way of using the bed net in out door is that bed net is tie uo with the rods but in present time no body is like to take pain  to do such work  every day so every body want to use which is easly o-oeratable. A number under CN 1083337 is developed a deceptive ceiling type luxury lifting bed net, consisting of hollow bed nlate, back rest of bed side, folded bed frame, foldable leg lamn, ceiling fan and decorative material. Generally it is placed in the centre of the room, so this device is only ment for use in the indoor with no automation device. Another inventer developed a device no. GB 100958. which is also fitted with the bed the conical shape is supporting it on a bed stead. The lower edge of the net weight around the whole circumference and its uoper end is provided with a ring and suspension loop, the  supnort for use on a bed stead comprises a telescooic suspension bar. The bars are fitted on the bed. This device  is also have so many draw back. There is  no such device which after opening the string the bed net take its own shape automatically. Another OB 73374 is related to mosqueto net sunoorts folding bed stand not a folded bed net frame which is take its  shape manual  fixing rods on the side of the folded bed. It can not be use on the ground.<br>
So the nresent invented device is foldahle mosquito's bed net which, after opening the tied strina. It take its own shape automatically. It is square in shape. It can be used<br>
on the ground too.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THF INVENTION<br>
It is  therefore an object of invention of Foldable<br>
Mosquito bed net.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to achieve<br>
the above object in  a structure which make the foldable<br>
bed net automaticlly opening and taking its own shape.<br>
It is another object of the invention to achive the<br>
above object in a structure which make the foldable<br>
bed net can be used on the floor too.<br>
it is another object of the invention to achive the<br>
above object in a structure which make the foded bed net<br>
can be used in single bed as well as the same can be<br>
used in double bed<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING Fig.  1    of model T  front view<br>
Fig.  2    of model TI assembled view<br>
Fig.  3   of model  III interal structure.<br>
Fig.  4    of Model  4 front view.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PROFFERED EMBODIMENT The foldahle mosqueto's bed net has a two parts  one is mesh and second is frame structnre. The upper part is mesh can be of cotten,Nylon,Hnpe etc. The inner frame is made of various metal/plastic nine ,rods,wire etc. The frame of model no. I is of nine. The frame has afour pine s both the side which is  attatched to a EH central provided nlate with the help of nut &amp; bolts. The pine is easly moveable up and. down. There is springs fitted within the side of two nines which make the upper eracted pine in 60 degree the lower  in l80de. In  the middle of the frame 8A  Fig. nine is attatched and joined with bolt and nuts through a  patti to other side of arm frame there is also four arms the same w^y the pipe s are fitted.<br><br>
On the erected pine side the arms are attatched witha bolt and nuts within a spring in the pipes.which helps in making the arms upword at the time of shaping the frame so the arms which is centrely jointed easly moveable up and down  and helps in fold the frame to make small in size and tie with string, as the string open, the folded frame take its own shape NTo.8 is spring fitted within pipes on the plate no7 is frame of  60 decree no.10 is mesh no.7a is a arms with in spring and 8a is  arm joint.<br>
Figure 2,- as shown in the fig. it is a manual operated frame to cover the bed one has to cover manualy no.11 is a attatched plate on which the frame is fitted  no.12 is P frame on which the stitched -nesh is attetched no.13 is mesh which cover the frame.<br>
Figure no. 3 ; - This is a frame of the foldable bed mesh which is of spring wire fitted with in a plate which no.S is helps in fitting on the bed a rubber jumper no. 4 is fitted with a came liver which make s the frame tight on the folded bed or on other beds it is only single wire fitted  on the plate and on the other side with a bolt<br>
and nut this is also foldable one covered with mesh no.1 is  snring wire no.2 is fitted no.3 is a came leaver no4 is jumper rubber no.S is plate .<br>
Figure no.4  a folded frame which has snrings within pipe<br>
which when itis  folded it became in small size fig. no.21<br>
as shown  in the fig. no.4 is a spring which not only<br>
helps in closing the frame but also helps in making the<br>
legs erected no.15 is amesh covered the frame no.17<br>
is a cross close r which also make the size  small.<br>
21. folded view of bed mesh.<br>
All the models can use on the ground.<br>
in all the models the covered mesh can easly removed<br>
change and refix after wash  the mesh.<br>
It became small in size when itis  fold and taken any where<br>
It can be used for single bed  and can be used for double<br>
bed with same bigger structure.<br>
The  device can be use on the ground too.<br><br><br><br>
