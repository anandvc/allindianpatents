				<td>The present invention relates to an electrochemical device to remove arsenic from ground and surface waters. This invention is particularly useful for the remediation of arsenic from ground water and the effluents containing arsenic.<br>
Arsenic is a toxic element that naturally occurs in a variety of forms in the earth. Under normal conditions, arsenic is found dissolved in aqueous systems in trivalent arsenite and pentavalent arsenate oxidation states. Arsenic in natural water may originate, for example, from geo-chemical reactions, industrial waste discharges and arsenic containing pesticides.<br>
Ground water for human consumption should be free from arsenic since it is toxin. The ground water bodies in West Bengal, Bangaladesh and part of USA are contaminated with arsenic. In West Bengal, India, an estimated 2,00,000 people currently suffer from arsenic induced skin lesions, some of which have advanced to pre-cancerous hyperkeratoses.<br>
The effective removal of arsenic by coagulation technique requires the arsenic to be in the arsenate form. Arsenite, in which the arsenic exists in the +3 oxidation state, is only partially removed by adsorption and coagulation techniques. Various technologies have been used in the past to remove arsenic from aqueous systems. The common methods involving adsorbents such as alumina and activated carbon, ion- exchange resins and electro dialysis are reported.<br>
An US patent number 6461535 dated 2002-10-08 filed by De Esparza Maria Luisa revealed a process involving (a) contacting with clay, a coagulant and an oxidizer with water containing arsenic to form a coagulated colloidal mixture (b) adsorbing the arsenic onto the coagulated colloidal mixture and (c) separating the water from the coagulated colloidal mixture for removing arsenic from ground water. The invention also provides a composition ready for use in removing arsenic from ground water to be used in remote areas. The composition includes activated clay, a coagulant and an oxidizer in pre-determined proportions for efficient removal of arsenic from ground water.<br>
A patent CA2327065 dated 2001-05-29 by Miyamoto Henry described an in-situ removal of arsenic from well water contaminated by arsenic. A reactive adsorptive barrier consisting of iron containing material and filter media surrounding the screened casing of the well was described.<br>
An another method (patent number US20030196961 dated 2003-10-23) wherein finely divided metallic iron in the presence of powdered elemental sulfur or other sulfur compounds such as manganese sulfide, followed by an oxidation step was provided to remove arsenic and TOC from drinking water or waste waters.<br>
A method (patent number US2004222162 dated 2004-11-11) for removing arsenic from water by using a reactor that is provided with a fluidized bed of carriers is disclosed. An arsenic containing influent is mixed in the reactor with a sulfide aqueous solution or metallic salt aqueous solution at a predetermined pH, thereby arsenic is converted to arsenic sulfide or arsenic acid metal salts. The arsenic contained in the influent is later removed by crystallization. An effluent with a reduced arsenic content in discharged from the reactor. The carriers, on which the crystals are formed, are periodically removed from the reactor, which is replenished with fresh carriers.<br>
An invention (patent number US2004262225 dated 2004-12-30) comprising a method and composition using akaganeite, an iron oxide, as an ion adsorption medium for the removal of arsenic from water and affixing it onto carrier media was disclosed.<br>
A system (patent number US6821434 dated 2004-11-23) for removing arsenic from water by addition of inexpensive and commonly available magnesium oxide, magnesium hydroxide and calcium oxide to the water was disclosed.<br>
A process for the separation of pentavalent arsenic from an aqueous solution using an N- alkyl pyridinium containing adsorption medium is disclosed in a patent CN1262665 dated 2000-08-09. An oxidizing medium and process for the oxidation of trivalent arsenic to pentavalent arsenic with removal of pentavalent arsenic so formed is also disclosed.<br>
A method for the treatment of wastewaters containing heavy metals and/or arsenic and/or non-organic anions was disclosed in a patent WO0234676 dated 2002-05-02. The said treatment is carried out in the galvanic cell, which consists of a mixture of metallic materials with various carbon-containing materials in the presence of a chemical resistant filter. A heat-treated carbon containing material, an acid/alkali resistant metallic material is used as a chemical resistant filter.A process for removing arsenic aqueous streams by (1) treating the feed with a compound containing cerium in the +4 oxidation state, preferably cerium dioxide, to oxidize arsenic in the +3 oxidation state to arsenic in the +5 oxidation state and (2) removing the arsenic in the +5 oxidation state from the aqueous phase, normally by contacting the treated feed with alumina or other precipitating agent containing cations in the +3 oxidation state was described in a patent WO 2004067452 dated 2004-08-12.<br>
A process for the preparation of arsenic free water, apparatus therefore, method for the manufacture of porous ceramics for use in pressure filtration to produce arsenic free water was described in a patent US20030183579 dated 2003-10-02.<br>
In all the above methods/processes either chemicals, or fine powders, which in turn are hazardous, were used to remove arsenic from water. A better process was disclosed in a patent RU2214968 dated 2003-10-27 wherein electrochemical processes for purifying natural and sewage waters containing arsenic compounds. Method comprises steps of electric coagulation in diaphragm-free electrolyzer having steel consumable anodes and placed in autoclave while supplying oxygent at a pressure 0.2 MPa.<br>
Another electrochemical invention (US20020036172 dated 2002-03-28) describes a process and apparatus for the removal of arsenic from water. The process consists in promoting the circulation of the water to be treated in an electrolytic cell equipped with iron or iron alloy electrodes while the contemporary insufflation into the cell of a gas, partially or totally, composed of oxygen.<br>
A device (US2003183516 dated 2003-10-02) for the decontamination of water, particularly of heavy metals and/or arsenic by means of electrolysis wherein the water to be purified is fed through a receptacle and passes by electrodes of different polarities. According to the invention, a combination of electrodes made from iron, aluminium and graphite or from aluminium and graphite is used.<br>
The drawbacks of the above inventions are:<br>
1.	The chemicals used for oxidation and adsorption may continue to remain in<br>
water if the dosage is excess. Generally the level of arsenic contamination will<br>
vary from source to source and also from time to time. Under such conditions it<br>
is difficult to arrive at exact dosage required for arsenic decontamination. If the<br>
dosage is less, the removal of arsenic is incomplete. In electrochemical processes, carbon-containing materials was used. Most of<br>
the carbon electrodes will disintegrate and very frequently these electrodes are<br>
to be replaced for better performance.<br>
2.	In certain cases, ion exchange membranes are used to adsorb arsenic<br>
compounds. The performance of the membrane will gradually decrease and<br>
when the surface sites are saturated, a separate process is required to<br>
regenerate the original surface. The membrane is to be replaced after certain<br>
period.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an electrochemical device to remove arsenic from ground and surface waters, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed herein above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device by which effective removal of both arsenite and arsenate can be achieved.<br>

In the present invention there is provided an electrochemical device for removing arsenic from water which consists of a three stage electrochemical reactor equipped with a plurality of both stable and soluble electrodes. The combination of electrodes can simultaneously oxidize the arsenite present in the contaminated water and generate an adsorbent in-situ on which arsenic is adsorbed and removed from water. Stable electrodes such as titanium metal coated with oxides of Ru/Tn/Ir are fitted in the first chamber, whereas both stable and soluble electrodes are placed in the second chamber and the third chamber is fitted with only soluble electrodes. The arsenite present in water is oxidized to arsenate in the first stage with the help of stable electrodes.

The important features of the invention have thus been rather broadly outlined. There are additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter forming the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. It should be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the disclosed specific methods and structures might be used as a basis for modifying or designing other methods and structures for carrying out the same purpose of the present invention. Such similar equivalent devices and structures do not depart from that spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the suspended claims. It is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and arrangement of the components. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.<br>
Novelty of the invention is that the oxidation of arsenite, ferrous iron is instantaneous and the oxidation, adsorption and coagulation are achieved in a single electrochemical reactor. This has been made possible by the no-obvious inventive steps of providing in combination a three stage electrochemical reactor consisting of a plurality of both stable and soluble electrodes; wherein the first stage chamber consists of a plurality of stable electrodes; whereas the second stage chamber has a plurality of both stable and soluble electrodes and the third stage chamber is provided with only soluble electrodes. This enables in situ generation of the adsorbent and varying the current can produce the quantity of the adsorbent required. Above all, electrodes that can resist corrosion are incorporated in the electrochemical reactor. The life of the electrodes used for oxidation purpose is long, of the order of 5 -10 years, and free from maintenance. There is no disintegration of electrodes as observed in the case of carbon/graphite electrodes. Thus sludge generation can be avoided. There is no need for pH adjustment. A further novelty of the invention is that there is no need to add oxidizing chemicals for the oxidation of arsenite and ferrous iron. It can be achieved by direct anodic oxidation or indirectly by the oxidizing agents generated from the electrodes. Similarly, the adsorbent also can be generated in-situ by anodic oxidation of iron. Thus both adsorbent and oxidation processes could be achieved in the electrochemical device. Yet another novelty of this process is the electrodes. Titanium coated with oxides of Ru/Tu/lr, which are very effective and durable, was used. Still another novelty is the compactness of the electrochemical device.<br>
