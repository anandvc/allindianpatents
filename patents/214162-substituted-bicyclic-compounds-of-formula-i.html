[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"SUBSTITUTED BICYCLIC COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA I"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS, INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
5	(SUBSTITUTED  BICYCLIC-eERIVATIVEST USEFUL  AS ANTlCANCER7reEttfÂ§	Background of the Invention	<br>
  This invention relates to nove-bieyelic derivatives-that-are usefulln the treatment of abnormal cell growth, such as cancer, in mammals. This invention also relates to a method of using such compounds in the treatment of abnormal cell growth in mammals, especially<br>
10     humans, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
It is known that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an oncogene (ij., a gene which, on activation, leads to the formation of malignant tumor cells). Many oncogenes encode proteins that are aberrant tyrosine kinases capable of causing cell transformation.   Alternatively, the overexpression of a normal proto-oncogenic<br>
15 tyrosine kinase may also result in proliferative disorders, sometimes resulting in a malignant phenotype.<br>
Receptor tyrosine kinases are enzymes which span the cell membrane and possess an extracellular binding domain for growth factors such-as epidermal growth factor, a transmembrane  domain,  and  an  intracellular portion  which  functions  as  a  kinase  to<br>
20 phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in proteins and hence to influence cell proliferation. Other receptor tyrosine kinases include c-erbB-2, c-met, tie-2, PDGFr, FGFr, and VEGFR. It is known that such kinases are frequently aberrantly expressed in common human cancers such as breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer such as colon, rectal or stomach cancer, leukemia, and ovarian, bronchial or pancreatic cancer.   It has also been shown that epidermal growth factor<br>
25 receptor (EGFR), which possesses tyrosine kinase activity, is mutated and/or overexpressed in many human cancers such as brain, lung, squamous cell, bladder, gastric, breast, head and neck, oesophageal, gynecological and thyroid tumors.<br>
Accordingly, it has been recognized that inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases are useful as selective inhibitors of the growth of mammalian cancer cells.   For example, erbstatin, a<br>
30 tyrosine kinase inhibitor, selectively attenuates the growth in athymic nude mice of a transplanted human mammary carcinoma which expresses epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR) but is without effect on the growth of another carcinoma which does not express the EGF receptor. Thus, the compounds of the present invention, which are selective inhibitors of certain receptor tyrosine kinases, are useful in the treatment of abnormal cell growth, in particular<br>
35 cancer, in mammals. In addition to receptor tyrosine kianses, the compounds of the present invention can also display inhibitory activity against a variety of other non-receptor tyrosine kinases (eg: Ick, src, abl) or serine/threonine kinases (e.g.: cyclin dependent kinases).<br>
Various other compounds, such as styrene derivatives, have also been shown to possess tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. More recently, five European patent publications,<br>
40 namely EP 0 566 226 A1 (published October 20, 1993), EP 0 602 851 A1 (published June 22, 1994), EP 0 635 507 A1 (published January 25,1995), EP 0 635 498 A1 (published January 25, 1995), and EP 0 520 722 A1 (published December 30,1992), refer to certain bicyclic derivatives,<br>
2<br><br>
5 in particular quinazoline derivatives, as possessing anti-cancer properties that result from their tyrosine kinase inhibitory properties. Also, World Patent Application WO 92/20642 (published November 26, 1992), refers to certain bis-mono and bicyclic aryl and heteroaryl compounds as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful in inhibiting abnormal cell proliferation. World Patent Applications WO96/16960 (published June 6, 1996), WO 96/09294 (published March 6, 1996),<br>
10 WO 97/30034 (published August 21, 1997), WO 98/02434 (published January 22, 1998), WO 98/02437 (published January 22, 1998), and WO 98/02438 (published January 22, 1998), also refer to substituted bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives as tyrosine kinase inhibitors that are useful for the same purpose.<br>

NR1R3<br><br>
5 signal for controls is typically 0.6-1.2 absorbance units, with essentially no background in wells without the PGT substrate and is proportional to the time of incubation for 10 minutes. Inhibitors were identified by reduction of signal relative to wells without inhibitor and ICS0 values corresponding to the concentration of compound required for 50% inhibition are determined.<br>
10	The activity of the compounds of formula 1, in vivo, can be determine by the amount<br>
of inhibition of tumor growth by a test compound relative to a control. The tumor growth inhibitory effects of various compounds are measured according to the method of Corbett T.H., et al., "Tumor Induction Relationships in Development of Transplantable Cancers of the Colon in Mice for Chemotherapy Assays, with a Note on Carcinogen Structure", Cancer Res.,<br>
15 35, 2434-2439 (1975) and Corbett T.H., et al., "A Mouse Colon-tumor Model for Experimental Therapy", Cancer Chemother. Rep. (Part 2)", 5, 169-186 (1975), with slight modifications. Tumors are induced in the left flank by subcutaneous (sc) injection of 1-5 million log phase cultured tumor cells (murine FRE-ErbB2 cells or human SK-OV3 ovarian carcinoma cells) suspended in 0.1 ml RPMI 1640 medium. After sufficient time has elapsed for the tumors to<br>
20 become palpable (100-150 mm3 in size/5-6 mm in diameter) the test animals (athymic female mice) are treated with test compound (formulated at a concentration of 10 to 15 mg/ml in 5 Gelucire) by the intraperitoneal (ip) or oral (po) route of administration once or twice daily for 7 to 10 consecutive days. In order to determine an anti-tumor effect, the tumor is measured in millimeters with a Vernier caliper across two diameters and the tumor size (mm3) is calculated<br>
25 using the formula: Tumor size (mm3) = (length x [width]2)/2, according to the methods of Geran, R.I., et al. "Protocols for Screening Chemical Agents and Natural Products Against Animal Tumors and Other Biological Systems", Third Edition, Cancer Chemother. Rep.. 3,1-104 (1972). Results are expressed as percent inhibition, according to the formula: Inhibition (%) = (TuWcontroi - TuWtestJ/TuWeontrai x 100%.    The flank site of tumor implantation  provides<br>
30 reproducible dose/response effects for a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, and the method of measurement (tumor diameter) is a reliable method for assessing tumor growth rates.<br>
Administration of the compounds of the present invention (hereinafter the "active compound(s)") can be effected by any method that enables delivery of the compounds to the site of action.    These methods include oral routes, intraduodenal routes, parenteral injection<br>
35 (including intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravascular or infusion), topical, and rectal administration.<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage<br>
40 is in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 1 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.05 to about 7 g/day, preferably about 0.2 to about 2.5 g/day. In some instances, dosage levels<br>
21-<br><br>
5 below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be employed without causing any harmful side effect, provided that such larger doses are first divided into several small doses for administration throughout the day.<br>
The active compound may be applied as a sole therapy or may involve one or more other anti-tumour substances, for example those selected from, for example, mitotic inhibitors,<br>
10 for example vinblastine; alkylating agents, for example cis-platin, carboplatin and cyclophosphamide; anti-metabolites, for example 5-fiuorouracil, cytosine arabinoside and hydroxyurea, or, for example, one of the preferred anti-metabolites disclosed in European Patent Application No. 239362 such as N-(5-{N-(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxoquina20lin-6-ylmethyl)-N-methylamino]-2-thenoyl)-L-glutamic   acid;   growth   factor   inhibitors;   cell   cycle   inhibitors;<br>
15 intercalating antibiotics, for example adriamycin and bleomycin; enzymes, for example interferon; and anti-hormones, for example anti-estrogens such as Nolvadexâ¢ (tamoxifen) or, for example anti-androgens such as Casodexâ¢ (4"-cyano-3-(4-fluorophenylsuiphonyl)-2-hydroxy-2-methyl-3"-(trifluoromethyl)propionanilide). Such conjoint treatment may be achieved by way of the simultaneous, sequential or separate dosing of the individual components of the treatment.<br>
20	The pharmaceutical composition may, for example, be in a form suitable for oral<br>
administration as a tablet, capsule, pill, powder, sustained release formulations, solution, suspension, for parenteral injection as a sterile solution, suspension or emulsion, for topical administration as an ointment or cream or for rectal administration as a suppository. The pharmaceutical composition may be in unit dosage forms suitable for single administration of<br>
25 precise dosages. The pharmaceutical composition will include a conventional pharmaceutical carrier or excipient and a compound according to the invention as an active ingredient. In addition, it may include other medicinal or pharmaceutical agents, carriers, adjuvants, etc.<br>
Exemplary parenteral administration forms include solutions or suspensions of active compounds in sterile aqueous solutions, for example, aqueous propylene glycol or dextrose<br>
30     solutions. Such dosage forms can be suitably buffered, if desired.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert diluents or fillers, water and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions may, if desired, contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus for oral administration, tablets containing various excipients, such as citric acid may be employed together with various<br>
35 disintegrants such as starch, alginic acid and certain complex silicates and with binding agents such as sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, sodium lauryl sulfate and talc are often useful for tableting purposes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed in soft and hard filled gelatin capsules. Preferred materials, therefor,  include lactose or milk sugar and high molecular weight<br>
40 polyethylene glycols. When aqueous suspensions or elixirs are desired for oral administration the active compound therein may be combined with various sweetening or flavoring agents,<br><br>
coloring matters or dyes and, if desired, emulsifying agents of suspending agents, together with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or combinations thereof:<br>
Method of preparing various pharmaceutical composition with a specific amount of active compound are known, or will be apparent, to those skilled in this art. For examples, see Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences, Mack Publishing Company, Easter, P.a., 15th Edition (1975).<br>

Preparation of 3-methvl-4-phenoxynitrobenzene<br>
30	Sodium hydride (95% dry powder) (83,62 g, 3.31 moles, 1.3 eq.) was charged under<br>
nitrogen atmosphere to a clean and dry 12 L four neck flask equipped with a condenser, a dropping funnel, a mechanical stirrer and two nitrogen inlet-outlet bubblers (Caution: sodium hydride is pyrophoric, avoid.contact with water or moisture). The reaction flask was cooled to 0 Â°C (ice bath) then anhydrous DMF (1280 mL) was carefully added using a dropping funnel. 35     The reaction mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 0 Â°C, then a solution of phenol (263.5 g, 2.8 moles, 1.1 eq.) in anhydrous DMF (1280 mL) was added using a dropping funnel over 2 hours (Caution: exothermic, vigorous hydrogen evolution).   After complete addition, the reaction mixture was stirred for 40 minutes at 0 Â°C (the reaction mixture turned to a white slurry), then a solution of 3-methy!-4-fluoronitrobenzene (390.0 g, 2.51 moles, 1.0 eq.) in anhydrous DMF 40     (dimethylformamide)(1280 mL) was added dropwise over 1 hour.  The reaction mixture was slowly warmed to room temperature and stirred at room temperature for 15-22 hours (dark-<br><br>
5 brown viscous solution) until all the starting material was converted to the phenoxynitrotoluene (TLC, 2% ethyl acetate in hexanes). Again the reaction mixture was cooled to 0 Â°C (ice bath), then carefully quenched with cold water (5000 mL) over 2 hours (Caution: exothermic, hydrogen evolution; first 100 ml water was added over 90 minutes). The reaction mixture was stirred for 1h, then transferred to a two 50 L carboys, each containing 40 L of water.   The<br>
10 contents was stirred and left at room temperature for 24 hours to afford the phenoxynitrotoluene, as a yellow solid. The yellow solid was filtered, washed with excess of water and air dried to afford 3-methyl-4-phenoxynitrobenzene (552 g, 96% yield). The crude 3-methyl-4-phenoxynitrobenzene was found to be pure by 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and used as such in the next reaction; m p 51-52 Â°C; FT-IR (cm"1): 1582, 1509, 1480, 1339, 1242, 1204,<br>

Preparation of 3-methvl-4-phenoxvaniline hydrochloride<br>
20	To a stirred solution of 3-methyl-4-phenoxynitrobenzene (2) (548 g, 2.39 moles, 1.0<br>
eq.) in methanol (5 L) was added 10% Pd/C (100 g, 50% wet, 46.98 mmol, 0.02 eq.). Then the reaction mixture was stirred under a hydrogen atmosphere (60-80 psi) for 15-16 hours at room temperature in a 2 gallon Parr hydrogenator. The progress of the reaction was monitored by TLC (50% ethyl acetate in hexanes, sm Rf = 0.69, pr Rf = 0.47, UV visible).<br>
25 Then the reaction mixture was filtered through Celite, and the solid was washed with excess methanol. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced pressure to give 3-methyl-4-phenoxyaniline as a pale brown viscous liquid (451.0 g, 95%). The 3-methyl-4-phenoxyaniline was found to be pure by 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and used as such in the next reaction<br>
