				<td>A METHOD OF ASSIGNING A NAVIGATION ORDER TO<br>
A PLURALITY OF OBJECTS AND APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a method of assigning a navigation<br>
order to a plurality of objects which are typically displayed on a screen and in<br>
preferred embodiments is concerned with navigating between or facilitating<br>
selection of objects defined in a document such as an HTML (or similar)<br>
document.<br>
Hyper-text markup language (HTML) documents are well known and are commonly<br>
used for transmitting information over the Internet. Each document page may contain<br>
a number of active areas or objects which can be activated by moving a cursor over<br>
the object using a pointing device (such as a mouse) and clicking a button associated<br>
with the pointing device. Typical objects may include images, pop-up buttons, radio<br>
boxes, check boxes, pop-up lists, links to other documents, selectable text and data<br>
entry areas, among others. In general terms, there may be a variety of objects which<br>
are selectable or capable of receiving a focus and the invention is preferentially<br>
concerned with selection or navigation among such objects.<br>
Pursuant to the invention, it has been proposed to display a document such as an<br>
HTML document (or similar) on a device which may not be equipped with a pointing<br>
device, particularly a receiver/decoder for a digital television system. The problem<br>
arises of navigating between the objects displayed on the screen. As used herein the<br>
term "document" is intended to encompass any data structure capable of defining or<br>
referencing a plurality of objects among which selection may be made or among which<br>
navigation may be performed; this need not be text encoded (as in HTML). The term<br>
"receiver/decoder" used herein may connote a receiver for receiving either encoded<br>
or non-encoded signals, for example, television and/or radio signals, which may be<br>
broadcast or transmitted by some other means. The term may also connote a decoder<br>
for decoding received signals. Embodiments of such receiver/decoders may include<br>
a decoder integral with the receiver for decoding the received signals, for example, in<br>
a "set-top box", such a decoder functioning in combination with a physically separate<br>
receiver, or such a decoder including additional functions, such as a web browser, a<br><br>
video recorder, or a television. As used herein, the term "digital television system"<br>
includes for example any satellite, terrestrial, cable and other system.<br>
In an HTML (or similar) document, objects to be displayed are defined sequentially<br>
in the document. It has been proposed that a simple way to navigate between objects<br>
in such a document would be simply to step through the object definitions in the order<br>
in which they appear in the document. This has the benefit of being simple to<br>
implement and ensuring that all objects can be reliably traversed. One proposal is<br>
simply to assign an up or left arrow key to move up the list and a down or right arrow<br>
key to move down the list.<br>
A problem with this proposal, however, is that, although objects tend to be defined in<br>
a document in an order which broadly corresponds to the order in which they are<br>
displayed on the screen, there is no direct relation. Thus, whilst it is easy to define in<br>
computing terms what the "next" object is, navigation may not be intuitive for a user,<br>
who will simply have to step through a number of objects in what may appear to be<br>
an arbitrary order to find the desired one. This can be frustrating on pages with large<br>
numbers of objects.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of assigning a<br>
navigation order to a plurality of objects to be displayed at respective positions on a<br>
display, these objects being assigned to a plurality of defined directions based on the<br>
positions of the objects, characterized in that said method comprises a step of<br>
including ascending or descending a level of heirarchy between these objects.<br><br>
The present invention also provides an apparatus for assigning a navigation<br>
order to a plurality of objects at respective positions on a display, comprising means<br>
for assigning these objects to a plurality of defined directions based on the positions<br>
of the objects, characterized in that said method comprises means for ascending or<br>
descending a level of heirarchy between these objects.<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of<br>
assigning a navigation order to a plurality of objects to be displayed at respective<br>
positions on a display comprising assigning objects to a plurality of defined directions<br>
based on the positions of the objects.<br>
In this way, navigation may be more intuitive as it may be based on the position at<br>
which objects are displayed rather than the possibly somewhat arbitrary order in which<br>
the objects are defined in a document or the chronological order in which objects are<br>
displayed.<br>
Preferably, objects are assigned to directions in (a preferably predetermined) order.<br>
This may enable a preference or priority between directions to be established so that<br><br>
the object assigned to a particular direction is dependent on the object(s) (if any)<br>
assigned to another direction in a preceding assignment step (if any). This may<br>
facilitate avoidance of assignment of objects to multiple directions and may facilitate<br>
selection of a "sensible" set of objects to be assigned to all available directions.<br>
However, objects may be assigned in parallel or concurrently to different directions,<br>
for example by a multi-threaded process.<br>
Preferably, the assignment of objects to directions is such that all objects on a page can<br>
be accessed. This may entail assigning objects in a fashion which is not necessarily<br>
reversible. That is, moving in one direction and then moving in the opposite direction<br>
may not necessarily return to the initial object.<br>
Preferably each object of interest can be accessed at least indirectly from any other<br>
object of interest. The term "object of interest" as used herein preferably connotes an<br>
object with which a user would conceivably choose to interact with or display. By<br>
having each object of interest potentially accessible from any other, pages can be<br>
browsed more efficiently.<br>
In more detail, the method preferably further comprises selecting a plurality of initial<br>
candidate objects from the plurality of objects, selecting from that plurality of candidate<br>
objects a set of accepted candidate objects and initially rejecting the remainder,<br>
determining whether at least one of the initially rejected candidate objects can be<br>
accessed from any accepted candidate object, and substituting the initially rejected<br>
candidate object for one of the initially accepted candidate objects if the initially rejected<br>
candidate object cannot be so accessed, whereby the initial rejection is reversed. Thus<br>
a wide range of existing methods of selecting acceptable candidate objects can be further<br>
refined.<br>
Preferably, the method includes searching for initial candidate objects in each direction<br>
and selecting a chosen candidate object in each direction based on predetermined<br>
selection criteria. This can enable more natural selection of objects than simply finding<br><br>
the first available object in a given direction and may enable other factors to be taken<br>
into account. The selection criteria may include rules for distinguishing between initial<br>
candidate objects of differing sizes. The selection criteria may also include rules for<br>
distinguishing between initial candidate objects based on closeness to a preferred<br>
direction. The selection criteria may further include rules for distinguishing between<br>
initial candidate objects based on chosen candidate objects for one or more other<br>
directions. The rules may be implemented in a receiver/decoder using relatively basic<br>
instructions, for example, summing, subtracting and comparing using integer values,<br>
such that CPU resources required to run the implementation are maintained at a<br>
minimum.<br>
The method preferably further comprises the step of determining whether or not an<br>
unchosen initial candidate object which was not initially assigned to any direction can<br>
be accessed from another chosen initial candidate object, and the step of assigning said<br>
unchosen initial candidate object to at least one of the directions if it cannot be so<br>
accessed. This can enable access to all of the objects of interest on a page. Preferably<br>
the features relating to chosen and unchosen candidate objects are equivalent to those<br>
relating to rejected and accepted candidates and vice versa.<br>
The step of determining whether or not an unchosen initial candidate object can be<br>
accessed from another chosen initial candidate object preferably comprises determining<br>
whether or not the unchosen initial candidate object fulfills a particular positional<br>
relationship with respect to the chosen initial candidate objects. In particular, the step<br>
of determining whether or not an unchosen initial candidate object can be accessed from<br>
another chosen initial candidate object preferably comprises determining whether or not<br>
the unchosen initial candidate object lies substantially up, down, left or right of the<br>
chosen initial candidate object. This can provide a simple and fast method of<br>
determining whether or not a particular candidate can be accessed.<br>
The objects will typically be referenced in a document, and preferably the objects are<br>
assigned to the plurality of defined directions substantially independently of the order<br><br>
in which the objects are referenced in the document.<br>
According to a second aspect, there is provided a method of assigning a navigation<br>
order to a plurality of objects to be displayed, which objects are referenced in a<br>
document, the method comprising assigning objects to a plurality of defined directions<br>
independently of the order in which the objects are referenced in the document to<br>
facilitate navigation.<br>
Navigation may comprise stepping from one object to another, preferably based on at<br>
least one input signal indicating a direction of travel.<br>
According to a third aspect, there is provided a method of facilitating selection of one<br>
of a plurality of objects referenced in a document, the method comprising displaying<br>
the objects and stepping through the objects based on the position of the objects on the<br>
display. Stepping preferably occurs in response to user input, preferably specifying a<br>
direction in which to step. The method preferably further comprises selecting an object<br>
based on further user input.<br>
Preferably, the method comprises defining a current object and an object to be selected<br>
next (a target object) in each of a plurality of directions. Preferably the plurality of<br>
directions includes at least four substantially orthogonal directions, more preferably<br>
up, down, left, right. Preferably, each direction has a button or other command input<br>
associated with it (for example arrow keys on a remote control). The invention is not<br>
limited to use of input keys and, in a development, the directions could be selected by<br>
means of voice or other commands or by detecting physical movement of a control<br>
device.<br>
The method preferably includes highlighting the current object and preferably also (or<br>
instead) includes indicating which object is assigned to each direction, preferably in<br>
a different manner to the highlighting, for example by means of an arrow or other<br>
highlighting. The method may comprise indicating a target object.<br><br>
In a related aspect there is also provided a method of facilitating navigation between a<br>
plurality of objects referenced in a document, the method comprising selecting a<br>
plurality of initial candidate objects from the plurality of objects, selecting from that<br>
plurality of candidate objects a set of accepted candidate objects and initially rejecting<br>
the remainder, determining whether at least one of the initially rejected candidate objects<br>
can be accessed from any accepted candidate object, and substituting the initially<br>
rejected candidate object for one of the initially accepted candidate objects if the initially<br>
rejected candidate object cannot be so accessed. The method may further comprise the<br>
step of assigning the set of accepted candidate objects to directions.<br>
Preferably, in addition to a plurality of "planar" directions (such as, for example, up,<br>
down, left, right), navigation may include ascending or descending a level of hierarchy<br>
or following a hyper-link, preferably by means of "enter" and "exit" or equivalent<br>
commands. This may facilitate traversing of frames and compound objects such as<br>
lists.<br>
Preferably, in the case of a list (or other group of objects), the entire list (or group)<br>
may be traversed as a single entity at a first level (that is, the entire list may be<br>
selected as a single object) and individual items (or sub-groups of items) may be<br>
traversed at a second level.<br>
In other words, an object comprising further objects may be traversed as a single entity<br>
at a first level and the further objects may be traversed at a second level, the object<br>
preferably being a list, frame or image map, and the further objects being entries in<br>
the list, objects within the frame and regions within the image map respectively.<br>
Similarly, preferably in the case of a document displayed as a plurality of frames,<br>
entire frames may be traversed at a first level and objects within each frame may be<br>
traversed at a second level.<br><br>
Preferably, in the case of navigating a document displayed as a plurality of frames,<br>
navigation is arranged so that, on reaching the furthest object in a given direction (for<br>
example leftmost, rightmost, uppermost, lowermost) within a frame, further travel in<br>
the given direction results in selection of the next frame in the given direction.<br>
Preferably, selection of the next frame further results in selection of the first object<br>
encountered in the frame in the given direction.<br>
The method may include defining a starting object, preferably without requiring user<br>
selection of an object, preferably according to a predefined rule, for example the top-<br>
left most object to be displayed. Preferably exactly one object is selected and has focus<br>
by default in the absence of further selection by a user.<br>
The method preferably further comprises classifying the plurality of objects into primary<br>
and secondary candidate objects, with respect to a or the current object. The step of<br>
classifying the plurality of objects preferably comprises determining whether or not each<br>
object fulfills a particular positional relationship with respect to the current object.<br>
The invention extends to corresponding apparatus aspects and preferably the method<br>
is implemented in a receiver/decoder; the invention extends to a receiver/decoder<br>
arranged to implement a method according to any of the above aspects. In such a case,<br>
the receiver/decoder preferably has a remote control and keys of the remote control<br>
are assigned to directions.<br>
In a first apparatus aspect, the invention provides apparatus for assigning a navigation<br>

preferably has means (for example an input device such as a remote control) for<br>
receiving user input and for stepping in response to user input, the user input<br>
preferably specifying a direction in which to step. The apparatus preferably further<br>
comprises means (for example a selection processor) for selecting an object based on<br>
further user input.<br><br>

outputting the representation of the document to a display (for display on the display),<br>
and means (for example, a suitably programmed processor) for stepping through the<br>
objects based on the position on which objects are to be displayed on the display.<br>
The apparatus may include a button or other command input associated with it (for<br>
example arrow keys on a remote control).<br>
The apparatus preferably includes means (for example a highlight display processor)<br>
for highlighting the current object and preferably also (or instead) includes means (for<br>
example a target display processor) for indicating which object is assigned to each<br>
direction, preferably in a different manner to the highlighting, for example by means<br>
of an arrow or other highlighting.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus includes means (for example a search engine) for searching<br>
for initial candidate objects in each direction and selecting a chosen candidate object<br>
in each direction based on predetermined selection criteria.<br>
The apparatus preferably comprises means (typically in the form of a processor) for<br>
assigning objects to directions, such means being adapted to allow all objects of interest<br>
on a page to be accessed. Each object of interest can preferably be accessed at least<br>
indirectly from any other object of interest.<br>
Preferably the apparatus further comprises means (typically in the form of a determining<br>
processor) for determining whether or not an unchosen initial candidate object which<br>
was not initially assigned to any direction can be accessed from another chosen initial<br>
candidate object, and means (typically in the form of the same or a further processor) for<br>

down, left or right of the chosen initial candidate object.<br>
The apparatus may include means (for example a starting object selector) for defining<br>
a starting object, preferably without requiring user selection of an object, preferably<br>
according to a predefined rule, for example the top-left most object to be displayed.<br>
Preferably the apparatus further comprises means for selecting a plurality of initial<br>
candidate objects from the plurality of objects, means for selecting from that plurality<br>
of candidate objects a set of accepted candidate objects and initially rejecting the<br>

by software running on the processor. In a preferred implementation, most or all<br>
apparatus features are provided by appropriate software running on a hardware<br>
platform including a processor, memory and a display generator. The processor<br>
preferably provides an execution environment for running an application, for example,<br>
by providing an operating system on which the application can run, or by providing<br>

By way of background, there will now be described a receiver/decoder for a digital<br>
television system, which is the preferred application of the invention; the invention<br>
may be employed in other devices, however, for example personal or hand held or<br>
laptop computers or other communication devices.<br>
Overview of a Digital Television System<br>
An overview of a digital television system 1 is shown in Figure 1. The invention<br>
includes a mostly conventional digital television system 2 which uses the known<br>
MPEG-2 compression system to transmit compressed digital signals. In more detail,<br><br>
MPEG-2 compressor 3 in a broadcast centre receives a digital signal stream (typically<br>
a stream of video signals). The compressor 3 is connected to a multiplexer and<br>
scrambler 4 by linkage 5.<br>
The multiplexer 4 receives a plurality of further input signals, assembles the transport<br>
stream and transmits compressed digital signals to a transmitter 6 of the broadcast<br>
centre via linkage 7, which can of course take a wide variety of forms including<br>
telecommunications links. The transmitter 6 transmits electromagnetic signals via<br>
uplink 8 towards a satellite transponder 9, where they are electronically processed and<br>
broadcast via notional downlink 10 to earth receiver 12, conventionally in the form of<br>
a dish owned or rented by the end user. Other transport channels for transmission of<br>
the data are of course possible, such as terrestrial broadcast, cable transmission,<br>
combined satellite/cable links, telephone networks etc.<br>
The signals received by receiver 12 are transmitted to an integrated receiver/decoder<br>
13 owned or rented by the end user and connected to the end user's television set 14.<br>
The receiver/decoder 13 decodes the compressed MPEG-2 signal into a television<br>
signal for the television set 14. Although a separate receiver/decoder is shown in<br>
Figure 1, the receiver/decoder may also be part of an integrated digital television. As<br>
used herein, the term "receiver/decoder" includes a separate receiver/decoder, such<br>
as a set-top box, and a television having a receiver/decoder integrated therewith.<br>
In a multichannel system, the multiplexer 4 handles audio and video information<br>
received from a number of parallel sources and interacts with the transmitter 6 to<br>
broadcast the information along a corresponding number of channels. In addition to<br>
audiovisual information, messages or applications or any other sort of digital data may<br>
be introduced in some or all of these channels interlaced with the transmitted digital<br>
audio and video information.<br>
A conditional access system 15 is connected to the multiplexer 4 and the<br>
receiver/decoder 13, and is located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the<br><br>
receiver/decoder. It enables the end user to access digital television broadcasts from<br>
one or more broadcast suppliers. A smartcard, capable of deciphering messages<br>
relating to commercial offers (that is, one or several television programmes sold by<br>
the broadcast supplier), can be inserted into the receiver/decoder 13. Using the<br>
receiver/decoder 13 and smartcard, the end user may purchase commercial offers in<br>
either a subscription mode or a pay-per-view mode.<br>
An interactive system 16, also connected to the multiplexer 4 and the receiver/decoder<br>
13 and again located partly in the broadcast centre and partly in the receiver/decoder,<br>
enables the end user to interact with various applications via a modemmed back<br>
channel 17. The modemmed back channel may also be used for communications used<br>
in the conditional access system 15.<br>
Receiver/Decoder<br>
Referring to Figure 2, the various elements of receiver/decoder 13 will now be described<br>
in terms of functional blocks.<br>
The receiver/decoder 13, which may be, for example, a digital set-top box (DSTB),<br>
comprises a central processor 220 including associated memory elements and adapted<br>
to receive input data from a serial interface 221, a parallel interface 222, a modem 223<br>
(connected to the modem back channel 17 of Fig. 1), and switch contacts 224 on the<br>
front panel of the decoder.<br>
The receiver/decoder is additionally adapted to receive inputs from an infra-red remote<br>
control 225 via a control unit 226 and also possesses two smartcard readers 227, 228<br>
adapted to read bank and subscription smartcards 242, 240 respectively. The<br>
subscription smartcard reader 228 engages with an inserted subscription card 240 and<br>
with a conditional access unit 229 to supply the necessary control word to a<br>
demultiplexer/descrambler 230 to enable the encrypted broadcast signal to be<br>
descrambled. The decoder also includes a conventional tuner 231 and demodulator 232<br>
to receive and demodulate the satellite transmission before being filtered and<br><br>
demultiplexed by the unit 230.<br>
As used in this description, an application is preferably a piece of computer code for<br>
controlling high level functions of preferably the receiver/decoder 13. For example,<br>
when the end user positions the focus of remote control 225 on a button object seen<br>
on the screen of the television set 14 and presses a validation key, the instruction<br>
sequence associated with the button is run.<br>
An interactive application proposes menus and executes commands at the request of<br>
the end user and provides data related to the purpose of the application. Applications<br>
may be either resident applications, that is, stored in the ROM (or FLASH or other<br>
non-volatile memory) of the receiver/decoder 13, or broadcast and downloaded into<br>
the RAM or FLASH memory of the receiver/decoder 13.<br>
Applications are stored in memory locations in the receiver/decoder 13 and<br>
represented as resource files. The resource files comprise graphic object description<br>
unit files, variables block unit files, instruction sequence files, application files and<br>
data files, as described in more detail in the above-mentioned patent specifications.<br>
The receiver/decoder contains memory divided into a RAM volume, a FLASH volume<br>
and a ROM volume, but this physical organization is distinct from the logical<br>
organization. The memory may further be divided into memory volumes associated<br>
with the various interfaces. From one point of view, the memory can be regarded as<br>
part of the hardware; from another point of view, the memory can be regarded as<br>
supporting or containing the whole of the system shown apart from the hardware.<br>
Architecture of Receiver/Decoder<br>
The receiver/decoder contains five software layers, organised so that the software can<br>
be implemented in any receiver/decoder and with any operating system. Referring to<br>
Figure 3, the various software layers are Application Layer 50, Application<br>
Programming Interface (API) layer 52, Virtual Machine Layer 54, Device Layer 56<br><br>
and System Software/Hardware Layer 58.<br>
The Application Layer 50 encompasses applications which are either resident in or<br>
downloaded to the receiver/decoder. They may be interactive applications used by<br>
customers, written in, for example, Java, HTML, MHEG-5 or other languages, or<br>
they may be applications used by the receiver/decoder to run such applications. This<br>
layer is based on a set of open Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) provided<br>
by the Virtual Machine layer. This system allows applications to be downloaded to<br>
flash or RAM memory in the receiver/decoder on-the-fly or on demand. The<br>
application code can be transmitted in compressed or uncompressed format using<br>
protocols such as Data Storage Media Command and Control (DSMCC), Network File<br>
Server (NFS) or other protocols.<br>
Interactive applications are applications which the user interacts with, for example, to<br>
obtain products and services, such as electronic program guides, telebanking<br>
applications and games. The following resident applications are used to manage<br>
interactive applications:<br>
•	Boot. The Boot application 60 is the first application launched when the<br>
receiver/decoder is powered on. The Boot application starts the different<br>
"Managers" in the Virtual Machine, the first being the Application Manager<br>
62.<br>
•	Application Manager. The Application Manager 62 manages the interactive<br>
applications which are run in the receiver/decoder, that is, it starts, stops,<br>
suspends, resumes, handles events and deals with communication between<br>
applications. It allows multiple applications to run at once, and thus is involved<br>
in the allocation of resources among them. This application is completely<br>
transparent to the user.<br>
•	SetUp. The purpose of the SetUp application 64 is to configure the<br>
receiver/decoder, primarily the first time it is used. It performs actions such<br>
as scanning for T.V. channels, setting the date and time, establishing user<br>
preferences, and so on. However, the SetUp application can be used at any<br><br>
time by the user to change the receiver/decoder configuration.<br>
•	Zapping. The Zapping application 68 is used to change channels using the<br>
Program-up, Program-down and numeric keys. When another form of zapping<br>
is used, for example, through a banner (pilot) application, the Zapping<br>
application is stopped.<br>
•	Callback. The Callback application is used to extract the values of various<br>
parameters stored in the receiver/decoder memory and return these values to<br>
the commercial operator via modemmed back channel 17, or by other means.<br>
•	Web-browser. This is used to receive and display web-pages which may be<br>
sent as HTML code or similar via the modem or the digital television signal.<br>
The application includes or is linked to the navigation tool to be described<br>
below, to enable navigation of web pages by means of arrow keys or similar<br>
on the remote control for the receiver/decoder.<br>
The API layer 52 provides high-level utilities for interactive application development.<br>
It includes several packages which make up this high-level API. The packages provide<br>
all the functionality necessary to run interactive applications. The packages are<br>
accessible by the applications.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the API is adapted to run applications written in the Java<br>
programming language. Furthermore, it can interpret HTML and other formats, such<br>
as MHEG-5. Besides these interpreters, it also includes other packages and service<br>
modules which are detachable and extensible as requirements dictate.<br>
The Virtual Machine layer 54 is composed of language interpreters and various<br>
modules and systems. It consists of everything necessary to receive and execute<br>
interactive applications in the receiver/decoder.<br><br>
The Device Interface layer 56 includes a Device Manager and devices. Devices are<br>
software modules which consist of the logical resources necessary for management of<br>
external events and physical interfaces. The Device Layer manages communication<br><br>
channels between drivers and applications and provides enhanced error exception<br>
checking. Some examples of managed devices are: card readers, modems, network,<br>
PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association), LED display<br>
and so on. Programmers do not have to deal with this layer directly, since the API<br>
layer controls the devices from above.<br>
The System Software/Hardware layer 58 is provided by the manufacturer of the<br>
receiver/decoder. Because of the modularity of the system and because services<br>
supplied by the OS (such as event scheduling and memory management) are part of the<br>
Virtual Machine, the higher layers are not tied to a particular real-time operating<br>
system (RTOS) or to a particular processor.<br>
As stated above, the receiver/decoder includes an application for displaying web<br>
pages, for example received as HTML code from the digital television signal or from<br>
the modem, the application including code for highlighting hyperlinks and other<br>
objects capable of receiving the focus in the web page. This includes, or is linked to<br>
the navigation tool to be described, to facilitate browsing using a remote control or<br>
other input device (not shown) associated with the receiver/decoder.<br>
Embodiment of Navigation Method - Navigation Tool<br>
The preferred embodiment of the navigation tool is a minimal system with a remote<br>
control, where the user may access every frame in an HTML (or similar) document,<br>
and every link within each frame, while at the same time respecting the structure of<br>
the document.<br>
By way of background, HTML documents define various objects, examples of which<br>
follow (most particularly hyperlinks) which are capable of "receiving focus", that is<br>
being highlighted (in a conventional arrangement, by moving a mouse pointer over or<br>
near the object) and then subsequently actuated or selected (in a conventional<br>
arrangement, by clicking a mouse button) to cause a jump to the hyperlink or other<br>
defined action. In the following, it is to be understood that there may be a current<br><br>
object which has the focus and a plurality of target or candidate objects which may<br>
receive the focus in response to a move command. On receipt of an enter or other<br>
actuation command, the object having the focus at the time will be actuated, for<br>
example a jump will be made to the corresponding hyperlink.<br>
It will be noted that, in the preferred embodiment, there will normally be one object<br>
(the current object) which has the focus, whereas in a conventional arrangement, there<br>
may be no objects which have the focus, focus only being assigned when a pointer is<br>
over an object. The feature of having a default object having the focus may be<br>
independently provided, as may the feature of providing a starting object having the<br>
focus without requiring user selection of an object. The starting object may be selected<br>
according to a predetermined algorithm, for example to determine an approximately<br>
middlemost object on a page or may simply be the first or top left object displayed.<br>
(?)<br>
In a preferred implementation, six interface elements are used to provide movement<br>
from within an HTML document. There are four controls to move up, down, left and<br>
right within the document. In this description, the directions up, down, right and left<br>
and (respectively) North, South, East and West are used interchangeably (except where<br>
explicitly stated or where the context requires otherwise) to refer to directions on an<br>
essentially planar display and are not to be construed as limited to any particular<br>
orientation either geographically or with respect to a user. Two other controls allow<br>
movement up and down the document hierarchy or to give the focus to complex<br>
objects within the document, to allow the editing of Text Field objects, for example.<br>
The different actions which are available are:<br>
*	Movement to the left<br>
*	Movement to the right<br>
*	Movement upward<br>
*	Movement downward<br>
*	Climbing a level in the document hierarchy, or 'exiting' a complex hyperlink<br>
*	Descending a level in the document hierarchy, or 'entering' a complex<br><br>
hyperlink<br>
Any remote control or input device capable of providing these six distinguishable<br>
inputs to the navigation tool may be used, so the remote control will not be described<br>
in detail.<br>
Navigation in an HTML document is effected from active object to active object. If<br>
there is no candidate active object available in the selected direction, a scrolling of the<br>
document will be triggered in order to display objects possibly contained in the<br>
document but not presently displayed (this is a preferred feature, which may be<br>
provided independently). If the document cannot be scrolled, the navigation attempts<br>
to proceed to a parent object; that is, it climbs to an HTML document at a higher level<br>
in the document hierarchy. In a variant of the preferred embodiment, the navigation<br>
and scrolling features are separated, subject to user configuration. This separation of<br>
features can afford greater flexibility and customisation.<br>
Definition of the Navigable Elements in An HTML Document<br>
Frames<br>
Frames consist of an HTML document, and may contain other frames which are<br>
usually objects which may be navigated through. The following table lists actions<br>
which are undertaken in response to respective controls.<br><br><br>
Hyperlinks<br>
There exist three types of hyperlinks:<br>
IsMap Hyperlinks<br>
These consist of an image. A cursor is placed over the image and can be moved within<br>
the boundaries of the image. The selection of this type of hyperlink leads to the<br>
despatch of a request containing the associated URL (an associated link to another<br>
object) and the current cursor position.<br>
The following table lists actions which are undertaken in response to respective<br>
controls to navigate between IsMap hyperlinks.<br><br>
It should be noted that if a change of scale is effected during the display of the HTML<br>
page, the real coordinates of the cursor will be calculated.<br>
UseMap Hyperlinks<br>
These consist of an aggregation of 'sensitive' polygonal, rectangular or circular zones,<br>
each corresponding to a URL. Each zone is accessible by means of the four directional<br>
controls. The navigation within this type of hyperlink can be complex (for example,<br>
a map of the United States where each state is a sensitive zone).<br>
The following table lists actions which are undertaken in response to respective<br>
controls to navigate between UseMap hyperlinks.<br><br><br>
Text Hyperlinks<br>
These consist of a rectangular zone which can contain several objects placed side by<br>
side in the direction of writing. The objects which constitute a text hyperlink can flow<br>
over several consecutive lines of a document.<br>
The following table lists actions to undertake in response to determined controls to<br>
navigate between Text hyperlinks.<br><br>
Forms<br>
A form is an object which may be understood as a set of objects which are treated as<br>
text hyperlinks. The form object is not displayed and each object within it can receive<br>
the focus.<br><br>
Description of the Algorithm for Selecting Hyperlink Objects<br>
Definition of the Current Focus<br>
The algorithm described hereunder may be implemented using basic instructions, for<br>
example summing, subtracting and comparing applied to integer values. In this way<br>
CPU resources required from the received decoder may be reduced to a minimum<br>
when running the algorithm implementation. Referring to Fig. 4, an example of an<br>
implementation using basic instructions will be explained. A candidate object 80 is<br>
referred to using coordinates XCO, YCO and XC1, YC1 of two of its opposite<br>
corners. In a similar manner a Focus object (current object) 81 is referred to using<br>
coordinates XFO, YFO and XF1, YF1. In order to determine if the candidate object<br>
80 is located to the East of the Focus object 81, the coordinates XC1 and XFO are<br>
compared to see if XC1 is smaller than XFO.<br>
The current focus is preferably defined by a rectangle corresponding to the zone<br>
defined by a hyperlink object (a rectangle is computationally simple to implement).<br>
A hyperlink having the focus is rejected from the search for candidate objects.<br>
Definition of the Search Zones<br>
Four priority zones of North, South, East and West are defined, and these correspond<br>
to the elongation of the object having the focus in the four geographical directions.<br>
These zones have priority in that they respect the structure of the document.<br>
It should be noted that, although these four directions are used (this may be both<br>
computationally simple to implement and allow easy and intuitive travel through a<br>
document), other possibilities may be used. In a development, a direction may be<br>
defined by polar selection means, based on an angular input or clockwise or<br>
anticlockwise directional signals and one or more search zones may be defined based<br>
on the directional signals; in such a case an object may be assigned to only a single<br>
direction at a time, the direction itself being varied to select alternative objects; the<br>
invention extends to such embodiments, and such a feature may be independently<br><br>
provided.<br>
These zones are shown in Figure 5, with Figs. 5a to 5d depicting respectively a zone<br>
labelled "Focus" and adjacent North, South, East and West priority zones.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the East and West priority zones are extended by adjacent<br>
zones at their North and South boundaries. Referring to Figs. 5c and 5d, adjacent<br>
zones 100, 102 and 104, 106 of respectively the East and West priority zones are<br>
shown.<br>
Four non-priority zones of North-East, North-West, South-East and South-West are<br>
dynamically defined as a function of the position of the East and West candidate<br>
objects. These zones are used to reassign the directions which have no candidate object<br>
in the priority zones and to allow the algorithm to be able to find every interactive<br>
object in the document. The dynamic calculation of these zones as a function of the<br>
laterally located candidate objects makes it possible to avoid (preferably at least for the<br>
North and South direction) the retention of objects located behind an East or West<br>
(right or left) candidate, as is illustrated schematically in Fig. 5e. The provision of<br>
both priority and non-priority zones is a preferred feature which may be provided<br>
independently or in combination with other features and is not limited to the specific<br>
zones described herein.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, a North East non-priority zone is defined by the right hand border<br>
110 of the North priority zone (as shown in Fig. 5a) and the line 112 passing from the<br>
top right corner of the current object (the object having the focus) to the top left corner<br>
of the highest "candidate East" or Eastern candidate object. If there is no candidate<br>
East, or if the upper border of the highest candidate East is situated below the upper<br>
border of the current object, the border of the zone is defined by the upper border of<br>
the East priority zone, as shown in Fig. 5c.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, the North West non-priority zone is defined in a complementary<br><br>
manner, with reference to the North priority zone (as shown in Fig. 5a) and Western<br>
candidate object or West priority zone. That is, the zone is defined by the left hand<br>
border 200 of the North priority zone and the line 201 passing from the top left corner<br>
of the current object (the object having the focus) to the top right corner of the highest<br>
"candidate West" or Western candidate object. If there is no candidate West, or if the<br>
upper border of the highest candidate West is situated below the upper border of the<br>
current object, the border of the zone is defined by the upper border of the West<br>
priority zone as shown in Fig. 5d.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, the South East non-priority zone is similarly defined, with<br>
reference to the South priority zone (as shown in Fig. 5b) and Eastern candidate object<br>
or East priority zone. That is, the zone is defined by the right hand border 300 of the<br>
South priority zone and the line 301 passing from the bottom right corner of the<br>
current object (the object having the focus) to the bottom left corner of the Southmost<br>
"candidate East" or Eastern candidate object. If there is no candidate East, or if the<br>
upper border of the Southmost candidate East is situated above the lower border of the<br>
current object, the border of the zone is defined by the lower border of the East<br>
priority zone as shown in Fig. 5c.<br>
Referring to Fig. 9, the South West non-priority zone is similarly defined, with<br>
reference to the South priority zone (as shown in Fig. 5b) and Western candidate<br>
object or West priority zone. That is, the zone is defined by the left hand border 400<br>
of the South priority zone and the line 401 passing from the bottom left corner of the<br>
current object (the object having the focus) to the bottom left corner of the Southmost<br>
"candidate West" or Western candidate object. If there is no candidate West, or if the<br>
upper border of the Southmost candidate West is situated above the lower border of<br>
the current object, the border of the zone is defined by the lower border of the West<br>
priority zone as shown in Fig. 5d.<br>
It is a preferred feature that candidate (target) objects are selected in order (and this<br>
feature may be independently provided). Having explained one possible definition of<br><br>
priority and non-priority zones, a preferred selection method will now be described;<br>
it should be appreciated that similar principles may be applied if the priority and non-<br>
priority zones are defined differently, and also that other orders may be used.<br>
In the first step, searching for candidates is confined to the East and West priority<br>
zones and all objects intersecting these zones are identified as potential candidates.<br>
In the preferred embodiment where the East and West zones are extended by adjacent<br>
zones (as shown with references 100, 102, 104 and 106 in Figs. 5c and 5d) the<br>
searching for candidates may be extended to these adjacent zones as well, in order to<br>
identify objects close the East and West priority zones as potential candidates.<br>
The list of potential candidates is then refined by a further selection process, as will<br>
now be described; this two stage selection process may be provided as an independent<br>
preferred feature, even if different selection mechanisms are employed. Several rules<br>
will be described; each may be provided independently or in combination with other<br>
rules, the combination of rules described herein being particularly preferred as it leads<br>
efficiently to a "sensible" set of candidate objects.<br>
Referring to Fig. 10, objects 410 and 411 at distances d2 and d1 from a current object<br>
labelled "Focus" are shown, If a rule states that objects closer to the current object<br>
are retained in preference to further objects then the object 410 is retained in<br>
preference to the object 411, the distance d2 being smaller than the distance dl.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11a, objects 420 and 421 at the same distance d from a current object<br>
labelled "Focus" are shown. If a rule states that in the event of objects being at<br>
identical distances, the highest object is retained (highest meaning the most Northerly),<br>
then the object 421 is retained in preference to the object 420, since the object 421 is<br>
situated to the North of the object 420.<br>
Referring to Fig. 11b, an object labelled "Focus" and its West priority zone 434<br><br>
extended by adjacent zones 435 and 436 is shown. An object 437 is located in the West<br>
priority zone 434 at a distance d3 from the Focus object. An object 438 intersecting<br>
the adjacent zone 436 which extends the West priority zone 434 is located at a distance<br>
d4 from the Focus object, the value of d4 being smaller than the value of d3. Although<br>
the object 438 is closer to the Focus object than the object 437, a rule may be that the<br>
object 437 is retained because the object 438 intersects the adjacent zone 436 only, that<br>
is, it does not overlap the West priority zone 434.<br>
In the second step, a search is made for North and South candidates in the North and<br>
South priority zones, as well as secondary candidates in the secondary zones.<br>
Upper and lower candidates are considered as priority candidates when they intersect<br>
one of the North and South zones.<br>
Two candidates are considered to be on the same line in the following cases:-<br>
Both intersect the current object;<br>
One envelops the other;<br>
Both are at the same distance (vertical distance between nearest horizontal<br>
borders, that is high border of current object to low border of candidate for upper<br>
candidate and vice versa) from the current object.<br>
In the case of two candidates being considered to be on the same line, they are<br>
classified as follows:-<br>
•	Referring to Fig. 12, an object 454 totally within a priority zone 455 is classed<br>
as a centre candidate.<br>
•	Referring to Fig. 13, an object 456 intersecting the left border of the priority<br>
zone 455 is classed as a left candidate.<br>
•	Referring to Fig. 14, an object 457 intersecting the right border of the priority<br>
zone 457 is classed as a right candidate.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 15a to 15e, selection between two candidates considered to be<br><br>
on the same line will be explained. Although the precise priorities need not be used,<br>
it will be noted that the algorithm described is asymmetric (in this example it favours<br>
a left candidate over a right candidate). This feature of asymmetry is important and<br>
may be independently provided; it is better at ensuring that all objects can eventually<br>
be traversed than a symmetrical algorithm, although an element of randomness could<br>
if desired be built into a largely symmetrical algorithm.<br>
The following rules may be applied:-<br>
•	Referring to Fig. 15a, a left candidate 458 is retained in preference to a right<br>
candidate 459.<br>
•	Referring to Fig. 15b, a centre candidate 460 is retained in preference to a left<br>
461 or right candidate.<br>
•	Referring to Figs. 15c and 15d, if two candidates are of the same type, the one<br>
retained is the one whose inner border is further within the zone 455, for<br>
example in the case of two left candidates 462 and 463 (see Fig. 15c), the one<br>
whose right border is rightmost is retained, that is, the candidate 463, and vice<br>
versa; hence in Fig. 15d, in the case of two right candidates 464 and 465, the<br>
one whose left border is leftmost is retained, that is, the candidate 464.<br>
•	Referring to Fig. 15e, in the case of two centre candidates 466 and 467, the<br>
one whose centre is closest to the centre of the current object is retained.<br>
If the candidates are not considered as being on the same line, the candidate retained<br>
is the one closest to the centre of the current object.<br>
Referring to Fig. 16, a candidate is considered a secondary candidate if it (that is, its<br>
encompassing rectangle) is situated entirely within a secondary zone 468, as is the case<br>
for candidates 469, 470 and 471. Two (preferably) secondary candidates are retained<br>
from each secondary zone. Hence the two secondary candidates 469 and 470 are<br>
retained whereas the secondary candidate 471 is rejected. A candidate 472 whose<br>
encompassing rectangle is not entirely situated in the secondary zone 468 may not be<br>
considered as a secondary candidate and is therefore rejected.<br><br>
A (preferable but optional) third step makes it possible to assign a secondary candidate<br>
to a direction which does not have a candidate or to assign a single candidate to two<br>
different directions. This step can also resolve problems of objects enveloping others.<br>
Complementary methods are used for reassignment of objects to East and West and to<br>
North and South directions; below assignment to only one of a pair of directions will<br>
be explained in detail with the complementary direction mentioned in parentheses; the<br>
same principles apply mutatis mutandis.<br>
To assign objects to the East (or West) direction, secondary candidates from the North<br>
East and South East (or North West and South West) are considered. The candidate<br>
retained is the nearest in the North-South direction to the current object; if there are<br>
objects at the same distance, the object retained is the nearest in the East-West<br>
direction.<br>
Similarly, to assign objects to the North (or South) direction, secondary candidates<br>
from the North East and North West (or South East and South West) are considered.<br>
The candidate retained is the nearest in the North-South direction to the current object;<br>
if there are objects at the same distance, the object retained is the nearest in the East-<br>
West direction. If there are no objects in the secondary zones, the candidate is selected<br>
from the East and West objects, preferably those situated above (below) the candidate<br>
object; the reassignment of the North (or South) direction to a laterally situated<br>
candidate enables movement to the highest (or lowest) object.<br>
With reference to Fig. 17 a plurality of objects A, B, C, D, E, F and G are shown.<br>
An object may be enveloped by another object, if the encompassing rectangle of the<br>
first object is situated entirely in the encompassing rectangle of the second object. In<br>
Fig. 17, the objects D and E are shown enveloped by the object C, which in turn is<br>
enveloped by the object B. The object G is enveloped by the object F.<br>
There will now be described an algorithm for dealing with objects which envelop<br><br>
others. This enables movement in a given direction towards an object which is most<br>
enveloped, for example from the. object B towards the object C, from the object C<br>
towards the objects D and E and from the object F towards the object G (this is a<br>
preferred feature which may be provided independently, and using alternative<br>
algorithms to the preferred algorithm described herein). In a preferred feature, when<br>
all the enveloped objects have been traversed, the direction of traverse is inverted until<br>
all the enveloping objects have been traversed.<br>
Referring to the table below, the effect of the above rules on the objects depicted in<br>
Fig. 17 will be explained.<br><br>
A fourth step will now be explained, with reference to Fig. 18, which makes it<br>
possible to select consistent objects for the North and South directions with the aim of<br>
permitting navigation among all available objects (this is a preferred aim and feature<br>
and may be provided independently or implemented by other algorithms).<br>
Referring to Figure 18a, an object 510 is shown to the West of an object 512 which<br>
has the focus, and an object 514 is shown to the South of the object 512. A further<br><br>
object 516 is located to the South of object 510. Using the algorithms described above,<br>
object 510 is considered as the West candidate and object 514 is considered as the<br>
South candidate. A further object 518 is located such that it would not be accessed<br>
departing from object 510, since object 512 would be the East candidate and object<br>
516 would be the South candidate. The fourth step is thus provided to allow object 518<br>
to be accessed.<br>
This step comprises reassigning the North or South candidates to a secondary<br>
candidate (respectively arrows 500, 501) if that secondary candidate cannot be<br>
accessed departing from the East or West candidates (Fig. 18a), that is, if the<br>
secondary candidate cannot be accessed by applying the navigation method to the East<br>
or West candidate, or if the secondary candidate intersects the North or South priority<br>
zones of the South or North candidates respectively.<br>
Figure 18b illustrates a similar situation, but where object 518 is closer to object 514.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 19, the effect of implementing the above algorithms in a typical<br>
document will be explained. In the figure, rectangles shown in full lines correspond<br>
to active objects in the document and rectangles shown in dotted lines correspond to<br>
zones defining a hyperlink.<br>
The arrows show possible navigation paths based on the algorithms described above.<br>
It can be seen that all objects can be traversed in a seemingly logical fashion by<br>
moving in one of four directions. Furthermore, it will be noted that the algorithm is<br>
not necessarily reversible, for example an upward move from the bottom left rectangle<br>
of hyperlink 600 leads to rectangle 602, but a downward move from there leads to<br>
rectangle 604. Similarly, several objects lead downward to the elongate rectangle at<br>
the bottom of hyperlink 608 (which may be a line of text, for example) but an upward<br>
move from there only leads to object 610.<br>
Processes used in the preferred embodiment for generating a list of candidate objects<br><br>
will now be described in more detail, with particular reference to Figures 20 to 23.<br>
For the sake of convenience and to aid understanding, several sets of pseudo-variables<br>
are referred to in the following illustration. The variables are defined as follows: -<br>
Candidate (<primary direction>): an array of 4 variables which refer to the<br>
North, East, South and West (primary) candidate objects.<br>
Secondary (<secondary direction>, <order or>): a multidimensional array<br>
of 8 variables, corresponding to the 1st and 2nd secondary candidates in the North<br>
West, North East, South West and South East non-priority zones. Order 1<br>
corresponds to the first secondary candidate in the relevant non-priority zone,<br>
order 2 corresponds to the second secondary candidate, and so on. As noted<br>
above, further or fewer orders of secondary candidate may be envisaged, but only<br>
two are considered for the purpose of this illustration.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates the sequence of processes for generating the list of candidate<br>
objects. A brief summary of the processes A to C (700, 800, 900) is presented in the left<br>
hand column 1200, and approximate corresponding pseudocode relating to the<br>
assignments which may be made during the execution of each process is presented in the<br>
right hand column 1202.<br>
Process A 700 corresponds approximately to the first and second steps described above;<br>
process B 800 corresponds approximately to the third step described above, and process<br>
C 900 corresponds approximately to the fourth step described above.<br>
Process A comprises the step of finding all primary and secondary candidates for the<br>
current selected object. Process B 800 comprises the step of filling any empty primary<br>
candidates with relevant secondary candidates. Finally, process C 900 comprises the<br>
step of assigning to corresponding primary candidates any secondary North and South<br>
candidates which are not accessible from the East and West primary candidates.<br><br>
With reference to Figure 21, process A 700 will now be described in more detail. First<br>
of all, the primary candidates are assigned in steps 704, 706, 708, 710. This assignment<br>
is in accordance with the current method used to select primary candidates; for example,<br>
choosing the nearest object in the East priority zone in the case of the East candidate.<br>
When all of the primary candidates have been assigned (or left blank, as the case may<br>
be), the secondary candidates are then assigned in corresponding steps 712, 714, 716,<br>
718. Again, such candidates are assigned in accordance with the current method of<br>
selecting secondary candidates, such as any of those described in more detail above.<br>
With reference to Figure 22, the process B 800 is now described. Steps 804, 814, 816<br>
allow all of the primary candidates to be examined in turn by step 806. Any candidates<br>
which do not have an assigned object, that is to say, were left blank in process A, are<br>
then assigned appropriately by steps 808, 810. As before, the exact algorithm used in<br>
step 808 can be customised to any extent, but in the preferred embodiment is the<br>
algorithm described in more detail above.<br>
With reference to Figure 23, the final process C 900 is now described. Steps 904, 906,<br>
912, 914, 918, 920 provide an outer and inner loop, running through secondary<br>
candidates from all of the non-priority zones in turn. As mentioned above, a maximum<br>
of two orders of secondary candidate are considered here (in other words, only a first<br>
secondary candidate and a second secondary candidate are considered for each non-<br>
priority zone). In steps 908, 910, the algorithm checks to see whether the secondary<br>
candidate under consideration is accessible from the East or West candidate objects. If<br>
not, the appropriate one of the North or South (primary) candidate is replaced with the<br>
secondary candidate in question. For example, if a secondary candidate to the South<br>
East is found not to be accessible from the Eastern or Western candidates, it will be set<br>
as the new South candidate object.<br>
The preferred algorithm to determine whether or not the secondary candidate under<br>
consideration is accessible from the East or West candidate objects tests simply whether<br>
or not the secondary candidate falls within one of the four priority zones of the East or<br><br>
West candidate object. This affords the advantage of being able to access any object<br>
without requiring an unduly complicated algorithm. In particular, the test is not as<br>
sophisticated as the combination of processes A, B and C used to calculate the candidate<br>
objects for the current object, and nor need it necessarily be.<br>
At the end 922 of the last process, the CandidateO array contains the correct four primary<br>
candidate objects. As mentioned above, when the above processes are consistently<br>
applied, each object of interest in a web page can be accessed from any other object of<br>
interest (objects which cannot be selected, navigated to/from or otherwise interacted with<br>
are generally be considered as not being of interest).<br>
Modifications may be made to the details of the flowcharts shown in Figures 20 to 23,<br>
particularly with regard to omitting, modifying or adding certain stages, so as to<br>
incorporate the details of the various different embodiments described herein, for<br>
example.<br>
One such modification is illustrated in Figures 24 to 26. In this algorithm, the step of<br>
checking whether or not a secondary candidate is accessible from the East or West<br>
candidate is performed more rigorously, yielding potentially better results at the expense<br>
of speed. In this embodiment, a further pair of arrays is also used:<br>
EastCandidate (<primary direction>), WestCandidate (<primary direction>): the<br>
same structure as the Candidate (...) array, but containing the candidate objects<br>
from the point of view of the Eastern and Western candidate objects respectively.<br>
As before, process A 700 comprises the step of finding all primary and secondary<br>
candidates for the current selected object and process B 800 comprises the step of filling<br>
any empty primary candidates with relevant secondary candidates. A new process D<br>
1000 comprises the step of finding primary candidates for objects corresponding to East<br>
and West primary candidates (for example, repeating the above processes A and B for<br>
East and West candidates). Finally, process E 1100, similar in structure to process C<br><br>
900, comprises the step of assigning to corresponding primary candidates any secondary<br>
North and South candidates which are not present in any of the members of<br>
EastCandidate() and WestCandidate().<br>
Processes A 700 and B 800 operate as previously, and will not be further described.<br>
With reference to Figure 25, the process D 900 is now described. Steps 1004, 1006<br>
effectively serve to repeat processes A 700 and B 800 but from the point of view of a<br>
different object (in this case the Eastern candidate of the current object). In the preferred<br>
embodiment, processes A and B are embodied by a single function which accepts as a<br>
parameter, amongst other things, a reference to an object which is to be considered the<br>
'current object'. Thus the steps 1004, 1006 can be carried out relatively efficiently. In<br>
variants of the preferred embodiment, processes A and B are embodied by a plurality of<br>
functions. Steps 1008, 1010 are equivalent to steps 1004, 1006 but for the Western<br>
candidate of the current object. It should be emphasised that the candidate objects<br>
determined for the East and West objects are determined to a first degree of<br>
approximation only, and are not refined in accordance with additional processes D and<br>
E. This saves computation, and can avoid a potential infinite recursion.<br>
With reference to Figure 26, the alternative final process E 1100 is now described. As<br>
before, steps 1104, 1106, 1112, 1114, 1118, 1120 provide an outer and inner loop,<br>
running through secondary candidates from all of the non-priority zones in turn. As<br>
mentioned above, a maximum of two orders of secondary candidate are considered here<br>
(in other words, only a first secondary candidate and a second secondary candidate are<br>
considered for each non-priority zone). In steps 1108, 1110, the algorithm checks to see<br>
whether the secondary candidate under consideration is included within either the<br>
EastCandidate() or WestCandidate() arrays (in other words, whether or not it is<br>
accessible from the East or West candidate objects). If not, the appropriate one of the<br>
North or South (primary) candidate is replaced with the secondary candidate in question.<br>
For example, if a secondary candidate to the South East is found not to be accessible<br>
from the Eastern or Western candidates, it will be set as the new South candidate object.<br><br>
It can be seen that the methods described herein for navigating around a web page are<br>
particularly suited to a receiver/decoder, amongst other things because of the<br>
simplicity of the controls, requiring only a reasonably standard remote control. In a<br>
variant of the preferred embodiment, all of the candidate objects for all of the objects<br>
in the web page are calculated once after the page has loaded, and are stored in a table<br>
for later use. This can afford the advantage of faster processing when navigating (by<br>
looking up the candidate object values in the table rather than calculating them each<br>
time). However, the dynamic nature of the calculation of candidate objects also yields<br>
benefits, since by not storing a table it requires less of the relatively scarce memory<br>
in a receiver/decoder. It can also allow a web page to be navigated whilst it is in the<br>
process of loading, for example, where the relative positions and sizes of the objects<br>
on the page may not be static.<br>
'Dynamic' navigation can also be of use in relation to javascript, which may not only<br>
show and hide objects on a web page (thus affecting the navigational relationships<br>
between all of the objects on the page) but may also create objects while a page is<br>
being displayed. Dynamic HTML may also hide and show objects on a web page, and<br>
consequently also benefits from the advantages of the dynamic navigation methods<br>
described above.<br>
All features described herein may be independently provided, unless otherwise stated.<br>
