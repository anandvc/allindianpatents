				<td>A TOPICAL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
Forming the subject of the present Invention are formulations containing ketoprofen or<br>
its S(+) isomer or mixtures of the two isomers, a combination of two UV filters, and an<br>
antioxidant The formulations have very low allergenic and photo-irrfant<br>
characteristics in regard to the skin, even folowing upon exposure to sunlight are well<br>
tolerated, and present an excellent penetration of the active principle through the skin.<br>
State of the art<br>
Topical pharmaceutical formulations containing non-steroida) anti-inflammatory<br>
agents (NSAlDs), In particular ketoprofen and dexketoprofen, are described in the<br>
majority of the relevant scientific literature as Irritant, alergenic, phototoxic, and<br>
photo-allergenic (Coz, hnstophe J. et al. Contact Dermatitis, 38(5), 245ff (1989),<br>
Bosca, F., J. Photochem. Photoblol., 43(3), 1ff (1998)).<br>
Numerous studies have been conducted in the past on the photochemical stabilization<br>
of formulations containing NSAIDs. An attempt has In fact been made to Include<br>
NSAIDs, in particular ketoprofen or dexketoprofen in ointments, creams, or gets in<br>
such a way as to obtain both physically and chemically stable formulations.<br>
The works of Coz, J. Christophe and F. Bosca were able to demonstrate that some<br>
parts of the structure of NSAIDs are inert, whilst others are photosensitive. In the case<br>
of ketoprofen, it is the part of the benzophenone that was found to be Implicated to<br>
photodegradation, whilst the residue of proplonic acid was found to be practically<br>
insensitive to Interaction with fight The specific photo-sensitivity of the dphenyl<br>
ketone group is due to Its properly of initiating the process of oxidation, thanks to the<br>
particular stablization of the activated triplet states.<br>
in Photochem. Photobiol, 50(3), 359 (1989), it was seen that four Impurities are<br>
originated from ketoprofen in aerobic conditions, namely (3-benzoylphenyl)ethane, (3-<br>
benzoylphenyl)ethyl hydroperoxide, (3-bsnzoylphenyl)ethanoi and (3-<br>
benzeylpheny1)ethanone, whilst in anaerobic coditions only 3-benzoylphenylethane is <br>
formed.<br>
The document WO9520387 highlighted the tmportance of choosing the appropriate<br>
moment for application of active substances; in the case of photosensitive<br>
substances, those should be applied only at night.<br>
The document JP60155111 describes pharmaceutical formulations for external use,<br>
which contain ketoprofen together with a UV filtar, chosen in the group of derivatives<br>
of para-aminobenzaic acid (PABA), anthranilic acid, benzophenone, cinnamic acid,<br>
coumarin, salicylic acid, or amino adds and, if necessary, an antioxidant<br>
Upon more careful analysis, the derivatives of benzophenone appear to be the<br>
preferred UV filers, and In particular benzophenone-3, at a concentration of 1 % by<br>
weight, with the possible addition of tocopherol as antioxidant, seems to be the only<br>
satisfactory one in preserving ketoprofen from photodegradation. Consequently, as<br>
may be noted, In no case is a combination of two UV filters suggested for the<br>
formulations described.<br>
In the document FR2804024, the inventors describe topical pharmaceutical forms<br>
containing NSAIDs, In particular ketoprofen, protected against photodegradaBon by<br>
means of solar filters chosen in the group: derivatives of cinnamic acid, of<br>
dibenzoylmethane, of benzophenone, of para-aminobenzoic acid, with the possible<br>
presence of an antioxidant chosen from among: butyl hydroxy anisole. tert-butyl-para-<br>
cresol, palmityl ascorbate, or tocopherol. The solutions proposed in the examples<br>
described in FR2804024 have not, however, proven completely satisfactory, in<br>
particular in the case of ketoprofen. In fact<br>
• Examples 1 to 8 describe formulations containing ethoxylated esters of para-<br>
aminobenzote acid (UV filter) and tart-butyl hydroxyanisole (antioxidant), but it has<br>
been possible to note that the decomposition of ketoprofen was still present after<br>
irradiation (up to 60% by weighy of the initial amount, see Table 1); moreover, the there<br>
were in any case present problems of phototoxicity of the formulations and the<br>
permeability through human skin was considerably reduced if compared to known<br>
formulations containing ketoprfen without UN filters (such as, Katum);<br>
• in Example 10, the use of octyl methoxy dynamate, together with butyl hydroxy<br>
anisole, does not prevent photodegradaBon of tenoxicam, and problems can be<br>
expected regarding the permeabiility through the skin caused by the large amount of<br>
surfactant used;<br>
- a formulation similar to that of Example 11 with suLisobenzone and butyl hydroxy<br>
anisote, but using ketoprofen instead of dIclofenac has proved to bo phototoxic and<br>
has shown a reduced permeability through the skin.<br>
Consequently, pharmaceutical formulations containing ketoprofen prepared on the<br>
basis of whatjs described In JP60155111 and FR280424 are not completely<br>
satisfactory. In general, they have proven phototoxic, and moreover It has been noted<br>
that the pharmacological properties are sensibly modified when compared with<br>
similar weft-known formulations containing ketoprofen, but without UV filter, such as,<br>
for example, Ketum. On the one hand, the. UV fillers described cause a change in the<br>
chemico-pnysical characteristics of the formulation (colouring, reduction in viscosity,<br>
modification of odour, etc.) and, on the other hand, affect some important<br>
pharmacological properties, such as permeabilty through the skin and the presence<br>
of photo-allergic reactions. Normally surfactants are used for stabilizing the<br>
formulation and for Dissolving the UV filter, but by so doing, permeabilty through the<br>
skin is reduced to a fractional value of what is obtained without said UV filter.<br>
Furthermore, the potential of photo-alergenicity Increases with the presence of the<br>
UV filter. In the case where is the UV filter that has characteristics of surfactant (for<br>
example, the ethoxylated derivatives of para-aminobenzoic acid), a considerable<br>
reduction in the permeability through the skin has been observed:<br>
In conclusion, what has been described in the foregoing Iterature would teach the<br>
person skilled in the branch how to increase the photostability of pharmaceutical<br>
formulations containing ketoprofen, but not, at least up to now, how to prevent the<br>
problems of phototoxlcity, photo-allergenicity, and reduced permeability through the<br>
skin, al of which are problems that still await a proper solution.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
Surprisingly, t has been found that only formulations containing ketoprofen or Its<br>
Isomer S(+) ketoprofen, together with a mixture of two UV filters, in particular a<br>
derivative of cinnamic add plus phenyl benzimidazol sulphonic acid, and an<br>
antioxidant, present, along with an elimination of photodegradation of the active<br>
principle, an excetent prevention of the phototoxic and photo-alergenic<br>
characteristics, together with an excelent tolerability and an adequate permeation of<br>
human skin. Surprisingly, it has also been noted that, although fitters of the UV-B type<br>
have been used, the formulations described also absorb radafion of the UV-A type<br>
(absorption extends to values higher than 360 nm); in this way, R becomes possible<br>
to protect both the skin and the ketoprofen also from UV-A radiation, thus reducing<br>
the risk of secondary photo-allergenic effects.<br>
In the case of use, as UV fitters, of derivatives of benzophenone, of anthranilc add, of<br>
sallylic acid, of para-eminobenzoic acid, or of amino-acid-based compounds, as<br>
described in JP66155111 or In FR2804024, a photoprotection, even though in<br>
general only partial, of the active principle (ketoprofen) was observed, but the system<br>
proved In any case to be phototoxic and the chemico-physical. properties were<br>
significantly modified. Also the addition of an- antioxidant, according to what Is<br>
explicity envisaged In JP60155111 and FR2804024, was unable to provide a<br>
complete solution to the aforesaid problems.<br>
In the case of octyl methoxy dnnamate as UV fitter. the active principle (ketoprofen)<br>
proved to be photo-protected, albeit at concentrations of the UV fitter higher than the<br>
ones used in the mixture of filiters: however, notwthstanding this, phototoxicity was<br>
observed In many cases. Also formulations containing only phenyl benzimidazol<br>
sutohornic acid showed a simitar behaviour.<br>
Consequently, mixtures of UV liters have been studed. Different UV filters were<br>
added to the derivative of cinnamic acid (for example, derivative of PABA, of<br>
benzophenone, or of camphor), but the problems of phototoxcity were not eliminated.<br>
in practice, on the basis of our findngs, only mixtures of derivatives of dnnamte acid<br>
with phenyl benzmidazol sulphonic acid proved satisfactory.<br>
Different compositioins containing ketoprofen and a mixture of two UV filters were<br>
studted versus the corresponding placebo. In the case of the mixture of octyl methoxy<br>
cinnamate and phenyl benzimidazol sulphonic acid as UV filters, the actine principle<br>
proved pnotostabte and. In the test for determining the phototoxicity in vitro (neutral-<br>
red-uptake test), there was observed a lower phototoxicity potential. The<br>
concentrafions of the UV liters in mixture could moreover surprisingly be reduced<br>
 with respect to the ones necessary when only one of the UV Store was used. It was<br>
noted,lntect,that a concentration of 1 % by weight for each of the UV filters -oclyl<br>
methoxy cinnamate and phenyl benzimidazol sulphonic acid - was sufficient to<br>
guarantee the stability of ketoprofen and the maximum reduction of phototoxicity<br>
From the toxicological studies conducted In vivo, it was found, for the formulations<br>
forming the subject of the present invention, that:<br>
- no skin reactions were attributable to a photo-irrftant effect:<br>
- no skin reactions were attributable to photo-ellergenic effects;<br>
- cytotoxic or phototoxic effects were observed; and<br>
- unike other formulation containing ketoprofen, no photoclastogenic effects were<br>
observed (Induction of chromosomal aberrations in Chinese-harnster-ovary cell<br>
cultures in the presence of UV light).<br>
Furthermore, the problems conceriting the permeabillity of human skin to the active<br>
principle In the formulations containing ketoprofen, have been solved.<br>
The present invention thus describes pharmaceutical formulations that contain<br>
ketoprofen or its isomers in high percentages but have negligible phototoxic or photo-<br>
alltergenic effects, high permeabillity through human skin, and excellent preservation of<br>
their pharmacological qualities, if compared to other known ketoprofen-based<br>
formulations without UV filters.<br>
The topical formulations based upon the present Invention are hence characterized<br>
as follows:<br>
- 2-5 % by weight of ketoprofen as a mixture of the two isomers, or 1-25 % by<br>
weight as single S(+) isomer;<br>
- 0.5-5% by weight of a derivative cinnamic acid, preferably octyl-para-methoxy<br>
cinnamate;<br>
- 0.5-5% by weight of phenyl benzimidazol sulphonic acid;<br>
- 0.01-0.2% by weight of a antioxidant;and<br>
- the residual content, up to 100% by weight, pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients. such as adjuvants, vehicles, aromas, stimulants for absorption, etc.<br>
 The active principle contained In the aforesaid pharmaceutical formulations is chosen<br>
from among ketoprofen, as racemic mixture, the isomer S(+) ketoprofen, or mixtures<br>
of the two Isomers of ketoprofen. The latter are to be considered both In the form of a<br>
free acid and in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable sal chosen In the group of<br>
the sate of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, tromethamine,<br>

referred to above.<br>
The percentage of active prindpie, calculated as free acid in the form of a mixture of<br>
the two isomere, contained In the formulation can range from 2% by weight to 5% by<br>
weight, and in particular from 2.5 % by weight to 5 % by weight; particulerly preferred<br>
are the rates between 2.5 % by weight and 4% by weight When only the S(+)<br>
isomer is considered, the percentage of active principle, calculated as free acid, can<br>
range from 1 % by weight to 2.5% by weight, and in particular from 1.25% by weight<br>
to 2.5 % by weight; particularly preferred are the ratios of 1.25 % by weight to 2 % by<br>
weight<br>
The percentage of UV filter is comprised between 0.5 % by weight and 4% by<br>
weight, preferably between 1 % by weight and 3 % by weight The derivative of<br>
cinnamic acid as UV filter is chosen in the group: dnoxate, diethanolamino-para-<br>

ester, n-octyl ester, 2-ethyt-hexyl ester, possibly substituted on the aromatic ring with<br>
one or two groups chosen from among: hydroxy, methyloxy, ethyloxy. ecetylemine; the<br>
most preferred one is octy-methoxy cinnamate (2-ethylthexyl-4-methoxy-cinnamate).<br>
The percentage of antioxidant is comprised between 0.01 % by weight and 0.2% by<br>

hydroxy anlsole (BHA), tert-butyl-para-cresol, tocopherol, tocopherol acetate,<br>
tocopherol succinate, ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, and sodium ascorbate; BHT<br>
is the most preferred.<br>
The formulations according to the present invention may moreover contain, as<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, adjuvants, such as water or monoalcohols of<br>
the ethanol type, vitamins, amongst which vitamin A and vitamin E are preferred.<br>
colouring agents, pigments with colouring enact, inhibitors of the formation of<br>
radicals, and preservatives in general, thickeners, plasticizers, hurrdiffiers, aromas -<br>
amongst which lavender oil is preferred -, polyols, electrolytes, gelling agents, polar<br>
oils and non-polar oils, polymers, copolymers, emulsifiers, stabilzers for emulsions,<br>
agents for Increasing permeabillity through the skin, etc<br>
As substances facilitetting absorption through the skin, the following are preferred:<br>
urea, pyrrolidone, n-methyi pyrrollione, decyl methyl sulphoxide, and sodium lauryl<br>
sulphate. Amongst the substances capable of increasing permeability through the<br>
sWn, also iposomes are to be considered as forming part of the present Invention.<br>

preferred, such as esters of hydroxybenzoic avid, or parabens.<br>
According to the excipients used, the topical formulations forming the subject of the<br>
invention may hence be in the form of creams, lotions, powders, or gels.<br>
A topical pharmaceutical formulation obtained according to the present invention,<br>
expressed as relative quantities of its various components, may, for example, be<br>
indicated as follows:<br>

S(+) isomer;<br>
0.5-5% by weight gelling agent;<br>
1-3% by weight 1st UV filter (preferahly a derivative of cinnamic acid)<br>
1-3 % by weight 2nd UV fitter (phenyl benzimidazoyl sulphonic acid);<br>

The pharmaceutical formulations forming the subject of the present invention can be<br>
obtained by mixing the components thereof according to the methods wed Known to a<br>
person skilled in the branch.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations -described can be used in the topical treatment of<br>
Inflammatory pathological conditions or of muscolo-skeletal affections, such as, for<br>
Instance, myalgias/myosites, and in particular for the topical treatment of pain and<br>
Inflammation associated to lesions to soft tissue, sprains and distortions, bruises,<br>
tendinitis, and venous Inflammation.<br>
In adiction to the antiheumatic effect, the aforesaid preparations show a photo-<br>
allergenic effect that is considerably lower or altogether absent, and this seems<br>
extremely important since, as asserted by S. Baudot In Therapie, 53,137ff (1998),<br>
the irritant allergenic, phototoxic, and photo-allergenic effects of formulations<br>
containing NSAIDs lead to hospitalizatio in 10% of the subjects treated.<br>

Photodagradation: after Irradiation with a Schott WG320/15 mm xenon lamp, with<br>
100 klux/h and 75 Wh/m. Table 1 gives the percentage of ketoprofen degraded after<br>
irradation for one hour with approximately 10J/cm2 In two preparations of the<br>
present invention, as compared to formulations according to the prior art<br><br><br>
Table 2 glves tha percentage of katoprofan remaning after Insolation In formulation<br>

PHOTOTOUYCITY:<br>
A commerclally avalable sun lotion with a factor of protrction 8, contaning a UR fitrr<br>
of an Inoganic type (TIOg/ZnO) was spplied on the sikh of the back of two group of<br>
10 haalhy human subjects.<br>
The formulation descrised In Example 1 was applied to thye firdt yo the group of 10<br>
subjects (group 1), who had alre3ady been treated with 2 mg/cm of sun oream, on their<br>
backs (skin type). Applad on the skin of the secound group of 10 subjects (group 11),<br>
skin type II) was a formulation woith all the Ingredients of Example 1 expected for octyl<br>
methoxy chnnamats. The subject underwent Irradition with a Schott WG32OV-5 mm<br>
xanon lamp, with 100 khx/h and 75 Wh/m In 5 doesse, and were examined after 24 h<br>
No reddening of the skin was observed after 24 h In group E in group II, the skin of 3<br>
subjects was not reddened, whilst 4 subjects showed a sight reddening, and 3<br>
subjects presented medium reddening of the skin.<br>
Different formulation containing ketoprofen, a UV fitter, and possibly an agent for<br>
enhancing the permeablly through the skin were compared with the respective<br>
placebos, and in all cases the phototoxicity was examined In vitro (neutral-red-uptake<br>
test). The test was conducted according to the standard procedure COLIPA. In the<br>
-tests conducted, the placebos in no case proved phototoxlo.<br>
Using the formulaSons containing the active principle, an antioxidant and, as UV filter,<br>
octyl methoxy cinnamate, and phenyt benzoimidazol sulphonlc acid, no phototoxic<br>
effects were observed. In the case of use of other UV filters (such as benzophenone- .<br>
3, benzophenone-4, derivatives of salicyc acid), the formulafions were in all cases<br>
phototoxic even when the active principle was kept quite stable during irradiation.<br>
In Table 3, the results obtained with two formulations described In the examples are<br>
compared with the results obtained with formulations prepared as described in<br>
FR28O4024 and JP80155111.<br>
From these results it is possible to deduce that formulations with<br>
ketoprofen/cinnemate-phenyl benzlmicladazol sulphonic acid/BHT do not lead to photo-<br>
allengenic reactions.<br>
Permeability:<br>
Table 4 shows the results on the permeabilty through human skin of various<br>
formulafiona, alt performed In comparison with simitar formutattons without the UV<br>
filter and the antioxidant<br>
