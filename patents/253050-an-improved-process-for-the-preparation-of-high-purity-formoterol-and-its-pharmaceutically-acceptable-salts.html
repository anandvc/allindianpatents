AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF HIGH PURITY FORMOTEROL AND ITS PHARMACEUTICALLY ACCEPTABLE SALTS INTRODUCTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of high purity formoterol base and its pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The particular salt envisaged by the invention is the fumarate salt. Formoterol base, (N-[2-hydroxy-5-[(lR)-l-hydroxy-2-[[(lR)-2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-l-methylethyl]-amino]ethyl]phenyl]formamide) has the formula-I(A) and its fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) given below is a well-known long acting and highly selective bronchodilator drug. The (^-adrenoceptor agonists taken by inhalation are the administration of choice in the symptometric therapy of obstructive airway disease.<br><br>
Formoterol is commercially available as a recemic mixture of (R, R) and (S, S) in a 1:1 ratio, and the generic name formoterol refers to this recemic mixture.<br>
Formoterol is developed by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Company as a long-acting beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist. Formoterol fumarate dihydrate is available in the market as Foradil Aerolizer, a capsule dosage form containing a dry powder formulation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate for oral inhalation with the aerolize inhaler. It is indicated in the maintenance treatment of asthma and in the prevention of bronchospasm, including exercise-induced bronchospasm, in both adult and pediatric patients. Formoterol given by inhalation has much longer duration of action than any other bronchodilators in the market. Therefore it avoids the nocturnal asthma, which often causes considerable anxiety and debility to the patients. The product is also indicated in the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including chronic bronchitis and emphysema.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Formoterol is first disclosed in a Japanese patent application (Application No 13121 (1972) by Yamanouchi and its related priority applications are 39416 (1972), 51013 (1972), and 52925 (1972). The corresponding German Pat is DE 2 305 092 and the US Pat is 3 994 974. Later on it is also published in Chem. Pharm. Bull., 1977, 25 (6), 1368-1377 by the same company.<br>
The aforesaid patent describes a process for the preparation of Formoterol based on N-alkylation using a phenacyl bromide (Scheme-1). Accordingly, the bromo derivative of formula-II is reacted<br><br><br>
with benzyl protected secondary amine of formula-Ill to get a coupled keto derivative of formula-IV. The keto group is reduced to the corresponding nitro alcohol (oil) of formula-V using sodium borohydride. Successive reduction of nitro group by iron and HC1 and the formylation of resulting aniline derivative with acetic formic anhydride gave the dibenzyl formoterol of formula-VII having four isomers RR, RS, SS, SR. Separation of RR and SS isomers is accomplished by converting the above dibenzyl formoterol into its fumarate salt and selective crystallization from isopropyl alcohol. The purified dibenzyl formoterol base of formula-VII is liberated from its salt and is subjected to hydrogenation using palladium-on-charcoal to get formoterol base of formula-I(A). The base is then converted to its pharmaceutically acceptable fumarate salt of formula-I(B).<br>
The second process for formoterol is disclosed in ES 2 005 492 as shown in Scheme-2. Key step in this process is a coupling reaction between 3-formamido-4-benzyloxyphenyloxirane of the formula-VIII and the unprotected 2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-l-methylethylamine of the formula-IX to get the intermediate compound of formula-X. The O-debenzylation of the compound of formula-X is carried out by treating it with hydrofluoric acid to get formoterol of the formula-I(A).<br>
Scheme-2 A modified process (Scheme 3) for formoterol is disclosed in WO 92/05147 (1992) and in the corresponding US pat 5434304 (1995). In this route, nitro epoxide of the formula-XI is reacted with benzyl protected amine derivative of formula-Ill to get the nitro alcohol derivative of formula-V in the form of four stereoisomers, namely RR, SS, RS, and SR. The dibenzyl formoterol of formula-VII is obtained either by reduction over platinum oxide of the nitro compound of formula-V and successive formylation of the resultant aniline derivative with formic<br><br>
acid or in a single step process using Raney nickel and formic acid. The crude dibenzyl formoterol thus obtained was then converted to its fumarate salt to remove unwanted isomers<br><br>
Scheme-3 (RS and SR) by selective crystallization of the crude fumarate salt. The pure set of crystalline isomers (RR and SS) are isolated by filtration, neutralized with a base to get the dibenzylformoterol of formula-VII, and hydrogenated over Palladium-on-charcoal to get the formoterol of formula-I(A). The formoterol base was then converted to its pharmaceutically acceptable fumarate salt of formula -1(C).<br>
Process disclosed in the first patent (US 3994974) for the preparation of formoterol fumarate has the following disadvantages.<br><br>
(a)	The chemical purity as well as enantiomeric purity of the intermediates and final product is not disclosed.<br>
(b)	Unwanted isomers of formoterol (RS and SR) are separated at a very late stage (dibenzyl formoterol (formula-VII) of the synthesis. This would lead to increase in cost and pollution, as the unwanted isomers are not recyclable.<br>
(c)	We observed that separation of unwanted isomers is not easy. It will require a number of crystallizations to remove these isomers from the required dibenzyl formoterol of formula-VII. This would lead to poor recovery of wanted formoterol.<br>
(d)	Process for the preparation of the stable dihydrate form of formoterol fumarate or its analysis is not mentioned in this patent.<br>
Process disclosed in the second patent (ES 2005492), for formoterol fumarate suffers from following disadvantages.<br>
(a)	The process uses expensive and rare chemicals like crown ethers, hazardous reagents like hydrofluoric acid and carcinogenic solvents like benzene. Such process is not suitable for scale up operations, as it will have serious health and environmental problems.<br>
(b)	No information about the quality of formoterol fumarate is disclosed in this patent.<br>
Process disclosed in the third patent (WO 92/05147, equivalent US pat 5434304) for formoterol fumarate dihydrate has the following disadvantages.<br>
(a)	Longer reaction time (69 hr) and higher temperature (90° C) are required to couple the nitro epoxide of formula-XI with benzyl protected secondary amine derivative of formula-Ill. Since nitro compounds are known to be thermally unstable at elevated temperatures, it is not advisable to carry out the reaction at such high temperatures for such prolonged time. The impact of higher temperature and longer reaction time will be severe on the yield and quality of required compound especially during scale up operation.<br>
(b)	Unwanted isomers (RS and SR) formed in the first step of the process are nearly 40% which were carried forward upto dibenzyl formoterol of formula-VII stage and separated at this stage via fumarate salt formation followed by selective crystallization. Such a process would require more reagents thereby making the process expensive and polluting.<br><br>
Also, the purification process at dibenzyl formoterol stage is not attractive as the unwanted isomers could not be eliminated to the required limit (0.3% as per pharmacoepial requirement) even after repeated crystallization of the fumarate salt. Such a process is not commercially viable.<br>
(c)	Selection of solvents like a mixture of isopropyl alcohol and ethyl acetate in the hydrogenation step (final step) is not advisable, as the solubility of formoterol base is poor in ethyl acetate and isopropyl alcohol.<br>
(d)	During process development work we observed that usage of water in recrystallization of formoterol lead to the formation of desformyl impurity of formoterol. Similar observation is reported by Gerald J Tanoury (Organic Process Research and Development 2002, 6, pp855-862) for (R,R) formoterol tartarate.<br>
(e)	The reported yields are not reproducible.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Formoterol fumarate has become a well-known bronchodilator that has now been on the market and has shown great promise as a valuable anti-asthmatic drug with few side effects. Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of formoterol fumarate, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of formoterol fumarate.<br>
We observed that a promising approach for such a process is to (a) avoid the carrying forward of unwanted isomers (RS and SR) of nitro intermediate of formula-V to subsequent steps (b) remove the unwanted isomers formed in the first stage by simple crystallization technique (c) avoid high temperature and prolonged reaction times involving nitro intermediates (d) minimize or avoid the usage of reagents like iron powder or Raney Nickel in the process (e) avoid the purification of dibenzyl formoterol intermediate via fumarate salt as it requires several crystallizations (f) avoid the usage of hazardous reagent like hydrofluoric acid and carcinogenic solvent like benzene (g) improve the hydrogenation process by employing better soluble solvent or solvent mixture in the process (h) avoid the usage of water during the crystallization/purification isolation of formoterol base.<br><br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) by avoiding the carrying forward of unwanted isomers of nitro intermediate of formula-V to subsequent steps.<br>
Another main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) by removing the unwanted isomers (RS and SR) formed in the second stage by simple crystallization technique.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) that uses minimum required quantity of reagents like iron powder, Raney nickel, acetic formic anhydride, etc<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) by avoiding the purification of dibenzylformoterol via fumarate salt.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) by employing a better soluble solvent or solvent mixture in the hydrogenation step.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C), which produces formoterol fumarate of more than 99.8% quality.<br>
Another objective of the present inventions is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of the formula-I(C) which maintains the unwanted isomers (RS and SR) below the pharmacopoeia limit (
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of formoterol fumarate dihydrate of formula-I(C), which meets the specifications of the European<br><br>
Pharmacopoeia 2005 monograph. According to this monograph nine impurities are identified and the limits for these impurities are fixed. List of the nine impurities with their limit is given below.<br><br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding that if one removes the isomeric impurities formed in the second stage itself the process would become simple and economically viable. It is also observed that the nitro intermediate of formula-V would crystallize readily from a number of solvents leaving both the isomeric impurities (RS and SR) in the mother liquor.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Process of the present invention is as given in Scheme-4 below. The crude oily compound of formula-V is prepared as per the process disclosed in US pat 3 994 974. Accordingly, nitrophenacyl bromide of the formula-II is reacted with excess secondary amine of formula-Ill in methyl ethyl ketone solvent medium at reflux temperature to get the tertiary amine derivative of the formula-IV. Reduction of the keto group present in compound of formula-IV with sodium brohydride in alcoholic solvent medium gave the crude nitro alcohol derivative of formula-V.<br><br>
Scheme-4 The crude oily nitro alcohol compound of formula-V obtained in the reaction is triturated with a non-polar solvent such as diisopropyl ether to get a yellow solid after filtration of the solvent. In the prior (US 3994974 &amp; WO 92/05147) art this intermediate was reported as yellow oil. The yellow solid thus obtained can be recrystallized from a number of solvents such as diethyl ether and diisopropyl ether, preferably diisopropyl ether. Recrystallization of the nitro alcohol<br><br>
derivative from diisopropyl ether gave the pure RR/SS mixture as a yellow crystalline solid with &gt;99% purity. Melting point of this solid is 76.7-81.5°C.<br>
Reduction of the nitro group present in compound of formula-V with Raney nickel in polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol or isopropyl alcohol preferably, methanol solvent medium under hydrogenation conditions gave the crystalline amino compound of formula-VI as dark yellow solid. Melting point of this intermediate is 94-99° C. In the prior art (US 3994974 &amp; WO 92/05147) this intermediate was disclosed as oily solid. In the prior art process large excess (more than 5 molar equivalents) of iron powder was used to accomplish this conversion. The Raney nickel used in the process can be recycled simply by settling the reaction mass and decanting the supernatant liquid from Raney nickel. Therefore, present process is cost effective and environment friendly. The amino alcohol derivative of formula-VI can be recrystallized from a number of solvents such as diethyl ether or diisopropyl ether, preferably, diisopropyl ether. Recrystallization from diisopropyl ether gave the pure RR/SS mixture as a yellow crystalline solid with &gt;99.4% purity. Melting point of this solid is 97.5-99.5° C<br>
The crystalline amino compound of formula-VI is converted to the N-formyl derivative of formula-VII using a formylating reagent such as formic acid or aceticformic anhydride. Crystallization from isopropyl alcohol gave the pure RR/SS mixture (99.95%) as white to off white crystalline solid. Present process avoids formation and repeated crystallizations of the fumarate salt of formula-VII. Therefore, this process is simple and cost effective for commercial scale up. In the prior art processes (US 3994974 &amp; WO 92/05147) this intermediate was converted to fumarate salt and purified by repeated recrystallizations.<br>
Debenzylation of the compound of formula-VII using Pd/C in methanol-ethyl acetate solvent medium gave the formoterol base of formula-I(A). The Pd/C used in the process can be 1-20% Pd/C, preferably, 5-10% Pd/C. The reaction can be done at 0-100psi hydrogen pressure, preferably, between 35-70 psi. The formoterol base obtained from the hydrogenation step can be recrystallized from a solvent such as isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, preferably, isopropyl alcohol. For example, recrystallization of the formoterol base in isopropyl alcohol gave the pure RR/SS mixture in 99.95% purity. The pure formoterol base is then converted to the fumarate salt by<br><br>
suspending the base in a hydrocarbon solvent and adding a solution of fumaric acid in isopropyl alcohol. Trituration of the resulting formoterol fumarate salt of formula-l(B) with solvents such as ethyl acetate, aqueous isopropyl alcohol, and acetonitrile gave pure formoterol fumarate. Later on it was converted to its dihydrate form by triturating the pure formoterol fumarate with double distilled water and isolated as a white to off-white crystalline solid.<br>
The Purity of formoterol fumarate dihydrate prepared according to the present process has &gt;99.8% purity with all the European Pharmacopoeia 2005 monograph listed impurities well below the specified limit.<br>
