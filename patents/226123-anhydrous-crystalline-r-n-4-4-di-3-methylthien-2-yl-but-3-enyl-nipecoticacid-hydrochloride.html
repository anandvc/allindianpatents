The present invention relates to the anhydrous crystalline form of the R(-)-N-(4,4-di(3-methylthien-2-yl)but-3-enyl)-nipecotic acid hydrochloride its prepar¬ation and use as therapeutic agent.<br>
USP 5,010,090 discloses a class of novel compounds that exhibit gamma-amino butyric acid uptake (referred to as GABA uptake) inhibitory properties and therefore said compounds are valuable for therapeutic use in the treat¬ment of epilepsy and other diseases related to GABA uptake.<br>
In the present invention the R(-)-N-(4,4-di(3-methylthien-2-yl)but-3-enyl)-nipecotic acid is referred to by its generic name of Tiagabine (INN).<br>
In USP 5,354,760 Tiagabine hydrochloride is disclosed in its monohydrate form.<br>
Method for transdermal delivery of N-(4,4-di{3-methylthien-2-yl)-but-3-enyl)-nipecotic acid and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof is disclosed in WO 95/31976.<br>
However, the monohydrate, which is stable at normal room temperature under dry and dark conditions, has shown less stability at elevated temperatures. The monohydrate will give off water at higher temperatures starting at about 50°C and resulting in a total loss of all water at the melting point at 80-85oC. The features of the monohydrate is very inconvenient in the formulation work with the compound. The alternative product, which is described in the US Patent 5,010,090 (column 8, line 62) can only be prepared through a labour<br><br>
intensive process as described, using ethyl acetate.<br>
Furthermore analysis has shown that products manufactured by this process contain unwanted amounts of the crystallizing solvent.<br>
Other organic solvents may be used in the isolation of the product, but organic solvents will often form chlathrates, i.e. solvates of tiagabine hydrochloride and the resp. organic solvent.<br>
These solvents are unwanted because they are either toxic to humans or may give rises to interaction-reactions with other ingredients in the pharmaceutical preparation, resulting in low stability of the dosage form.<br>
Further it has been found that the compound is heavily soluble in the applied organic solvents, which is very inconvenient when working on larger scale.<br>
It has now been found that an anhydrate form can be obtained from water solutions under special conditions, which allow the anhydrate to be formed selectively and in high purity and recovery.<br>
The anhydrate form of Tiagabine hydrochloride is non-hygroscopic and thermally stable under normal storage conditions.<br>
The anhydrous form of the present invention is very applicable for the pharmaceutical formulation and stable under the normal process conditions used.<br>
The Tiagabine hydrochloride anhydrate is characterized by a specific X-ray powder diffractogram and a typical IR-spectrum of the crystals in KBr. The<br><br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) profile of the anhydrate is typical of showing only 1 peak indicating the melting of the compound at temperatures from 190 to 200°C.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for producing the crystalline anhydrous Tiagabine hydrochloride, which comprises crystallizing Tiagabine hydrochloride from an aqueous hydrochloric acid solution in not less than 0.55 M hydrochloric acid concentration, preferably in not less than 1.3 M hydrochloric acid concentration.<br>
The solution of Tiagabine and hydrochloride is normally made up at a tempera¬ture above 50°C.<br>
The crystallization may be initiated by seeding, but this can also be omitted as the crystallization can start spontaneously.<br>
The crystals can be isolated by conventional procedures such as filtration or centrifugation. The crystals may be rinsed by water or diluted hydrochloric acid before drying, which can be performed either under reduced pressure or at normal pressure at room temperature or higher temperatures.<br>
It has now been found that the anhydrate form of N-(4,4-di(3-methylthien-2-yl)-but-3-enyl)-nipecotic acid hydrochloride obtained as described in the present Invention will solve the problems related to the monohydrate-form in the manufacture of the medicinal product. The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising the anhydrous crystalline form of the R(-)-N-(4,4-di(3-methylthien-2-yl)but-3-enYl)-nipecotic acid hydrochloride and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br><br>
The compositions of this invention are usually adapted for oral administration, but formulations for dissolution for parenteral administration, transdermal delivery or sustained release delivery are also within the scope of this inven¬tion.<br>
The composition is usually presented as a unit dose composition containing 0.1-3000 mg of a compound In accordance with the invention for oral dosing. Typical dosage for the treatment of epilepsy would vary between 1.0-500 mg, preferably between 1-1000 mg per day and more preferably between 1 to 100 mg per day either once or divided in 2 or 3 doses when administered orally.<br>
Preferred unit dosage forms include in solid form, tablets or capsules, in liquid form, solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs or capsules filled with the same, in the form of patches for transdermal administration or in form of sterile injectable solutions.<br>
The composition of this invention may be formulated by conventional methods of galenic pharmacy.<br>
Conventional excipients are such pharmaceutically acceptable organic or inorganic carrier substances suitable for parenteral or oral application which do not deleteriously react with the active compound.<br>
Examples of such carriers are water, salt solutions, alcohols, polyethylene glycols, polyhydroxy ethoxylated castor oil, syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, gelatin, lactose, terra alba, sucrose, agar, pectin, acacia, amylose, magnesium stearate, talc, silicic acid, stearic acid, fatty acid monoglycerides and diglycerides, pentaerythritol fatty acid esters, hydroxymethylcellulose and<br><br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can be sterilized and mixed, if desired, with auxiliary agents, such as binders, lubricants, preservatives, disintegrants, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, salt for influencing osmotic pressure, buffers and/or colouring substances and the like, which do not deleteriously react with the active compound.<br>
For parenteral application, particularly suitable are injectable solutions or suspensions, preferably aqueous solutions with the active compound dissolved in polyhydroxylated castor oil.<br>
For oral administration, particularly suitable are tablets, dragees, or capsules having talc and/or a carbohydrate carrier or binder or the like, the carrier preferably being lactose and/or corn starch and/or potato starch. A syrup, elixir or like can be used when a sweetened vehicle can be employed.<br>
A typical tablet, which may be prepared by conventional tabletting tech¬niques, contains:<br><br><br>
The invention also provides methods of treatment of diseases related to GABA uptake in mammals including humans which methods comprises administering an effective amount of an anhydrous crystalline form of the R(-)-N-(4,4-di|3-methylthien-2-yl)but-3-enyl)-nipecotic acid hydrochloride.<br>
The invention further provides a pharmaceuticaily acceptable anhydrous crystalline form of the R(-)-N-(4,4-di|3-methylthien-2-yl)but-3-enyl)-nipecotic acid hydrochloride for therapeutic use in the treatment of epilepsy and other diseases related to GABA uptake.<br>
