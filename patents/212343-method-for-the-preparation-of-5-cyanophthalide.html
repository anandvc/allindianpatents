METHOD FOR THE PREPARATION OF 5-CYANOPHTHALIDE<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide<br>
which is an intermediate used in the manufacture of the well known antidepressant drug<br>
citalopram,	l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyI]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-<br>
isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally active serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, accordingly having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been reported in several publications, eg. J. Hyttel, Prog, Neuro-PsychopharmacoL &amp; Biol Psychiat, 1982, 5,277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr, Scand., 1987, 75, 478-486.<br>
Citalopram is prepared by the process described in US Patent No 4,650,884, according to which 5-cyanophthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, i.e, with 4-fluoro-phenyl magnesium halogenide and N,N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively, and the resulting compound of the formula<br><br><br>
Enantiomers of citalopram may be prepared by the method described in US Patent No. 4,943,590, i.e. by separating the enantiomers of the intemiediate of Formula II and performing enantioselective ring closure in order to obtain the desired enantiomer.<br>
Thus, 5-cyanophthalide is an important intermediate for the manufacture of citalopram and it is important to produce this material in an adequate quality, by a convenient process and in a cost-effective way.<br>
A method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide has previously been described in Bull. Soc. Sci. Bretagne, 26, 1951, 35 and in Levy and Stephen, J. Chem. Soc, 1931, 867. By this method, 5-aminophthalide is converted to the corresponding 5-cyanophthalide by diazotation followed by reaction with CuCN. 5-Aminophthalide was obtained from 4-aminophthalimide by a two step reduction procedure.<br>
Synthesis of certain alkyl- and phenylnitriles from acid chlorides is described in Tetrahedron Letters, 1982,23,14, 1505 -1508, and in Tetrahedron, 1998, 54, 9281.<br>
Though a number of other methods failed, it has been found that 5-cyanophthalide may be prepared in high yields by a convenient, cost-effective procedure from 5-carboxyphthalide.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a novel method for the preparation of 5-cyanophthalide from 5-carboxyphthalide comprising<br><br><br><br>
wherein R, is C1-6 alkyl or phenyl. The acid chloride is conveniently obtained by treatment of 5-carboxyphthalide with POCI3, PCI5 or SOCI2 neat or in a suitable solvent, such as toluene or toluene comprising a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylfonnamide. The ester is obtained by treatment of 5-carboxyphthalide with an alcohol R,OH, wherein R1 is as defined above, in the presence of an acid, preferably a mineral acid or a Lewis acid, such as HCl, H2SO4 POCI3, PCI5 or SOCl2. Altematively, the ester may be obtained from the acid chloride by reaction with an alcohol. The ester of Formula VI or the acid chloride of Formula VII is then converted to the amide of Formula IV by amidation with ammonia or an C^g alkylamine, preferably t-butyl amine.<br>
Throughout the specification and Claims, C1-6 alkyl refers to a branched or unbranched alkyl group having from one to six carbon atoms inclusive, such as methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-pro-pyl, 1-butyl, 2-butyl, 2-methyl-2-propyl, 2,2-dimethyl-l-ethyl and 2-methyl-l-propyl.<br>
The dehydrating agent used in step b) may be any suitable dehydrating agent, and the optimal agent may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art. Examples of suitable dehydrating agents are SOCI2, POCI3 and PCI5, preferably SOCl2.<br>
The reaction in step b) is carried out neat or in a suitable solvent, such as toluene, sulfolan or conveniently acetonitrile. When the reaction is carried out in a solvent, 1.0 - 1.5, preferably 1.0 - 1.2 equivalents of dehydrating agent is used per equivalent of the amide of Formula V. Furthermore, when a solvent is used, a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide may be needed, in particular when the dehydrating agent is SOCl2. Preferably, toluene is used as the solvent, if necessary in the presence of a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide.<br><br>
The reaction in step b) is carried out at elevated temperature, preferably at the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
The reaction time is not important and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
5-Cyanophthalide may be isolated in a conventional way, e.g. by addition of water, filtration and subsequent washing of the crystals. Further purification may, if desired, be performed by recrystallisation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, R in Formula IV is H or t-butyl. When the reaction in step a) is carried out via an ester, R, is preferably methyl or ethyl.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention 5-carboxyphthalide of Formula HI is reacted with an alcohol, R,OH, preferably ethanol, in the presence of POCI3, in order to obtain the corresponding ester of Formula VI, which is then reacted with ammonia thereby giving 5-carbamoylphthalide, which in turn is reacted with SOCI2 in toluene comprising a catalytic amount of N,N-dimethylformamide.<br>
Surprisingly, substantially no reaction takes place at the lactone ring. Accordingly, by the process of the invention, 5-cyanophthalide is obtained in high yields and the process is much more convenient than the known process and uses more convenient and cheaper reactants and conditions.<br>
The 5-carboxyphthalide used as a starting material may be obtained by the methods described in US patent No. 3,607,884 or German patent No. 2630927, i.e. by reacting a concentrated solution of terephthalic acid with formaldehyde in liquid SO3 or by electrochemical hydrogenation of trimellithic acid.<br>
