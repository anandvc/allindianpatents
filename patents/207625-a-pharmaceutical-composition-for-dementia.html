DESCRIPTION<br>
DEMENTIA  REMEDIES   CONTAINING  2-ARYL-8-OXODIHYDROPURINE DERIVATIVES AS THE ACTIVE INGREDIENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a medicine for treatment of dementia comprising a 2-aryl-8-oxodihydro-purine derivative, in more detail, a 2-aryl-8-oxodihydro-purine derivative which has an acetamide moiety at the 7-or 9-position of the purine ring. BACKGROUND ART<br>
With the advance of aging of society, the increase of patients suffering from dementia has been causing a social problem, and about 90 % thereof is occupied with Alzheimer-type dementia and cerebrovascular dementia. With respect to the symptom of dementia, short- and long-term dysmnesia is a fundamental and common core symptom, therefore it is considered that the dementia is composed of dysmnesia, disorientation due to dysmnesia and higher brain dysfunction associated therewith. In the patients suffering from dementia, the functions of various neurotransmitter systems are remarkably decreased mainly in the cerebral cortex and the limbic system, additionally the function of cerebral energy metabolism is also decreased.<br><br>
Especially in the patients with Alzheimer-type dementia, the hypofunctions of neurotransmission are found in cholinergic, glutamatergic, neuropeptidergic and monoaminergic system, and it is suggested that the main cause of Alzheimer-type dementia is dysfunction of such neurotransmitter systems [Coyle, J. T- et al., Science, 219, 1184-1190 (1983); Gottfries, C. G. et al., Psychopharmacology, ££, 245-252 (1985)].  Besides, from the<br>
viewpoint of the neurotoxicity induced by p-amyloid peptide, it is guessed that the loss of hippocampal neurons through<br>
the accumulation of p-amyloid peptide in senile plaque on the surface of the cell is involved in the mechanism of disease onset,  and is also one of the main causes of Alzheimer-type dementia [Selkoe D. J., Annu. Rev. Neurosci., 12, 463-490 (1989)].<br>
On the basis of the finding that the remarkable neuronal dysfunction associated with cholinergic system is a cause of dysmnesia in dementia as suggested above, the medicines for improving the symptoms of dementia by means of the activation of cholinergic system have been developed. Further, on giving attention to the decrease of glutamatergic neurons and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (hereinafter, abbreviated to "NMDA") receptors, which is one of receptors of glutamic acid, a medicine to activate the NMDA receptor function has been also developed.<br><br>
Recently, there are also some attempts to develop agonists for the peripheral-type benzodiazepine (hereinafter, optionally abbreviated to "BZco3") receptors as the therapeutic agent for improvement in the symptoms of dementia. For example, it has been reported that N,N-di-n-hexyl-2-(4-fluorophenyl)indol-3-acetamide     (hereinafter,<br>
abbreviated to "FGIN-1-27") which is an agonist for BZco3 receptors, and some kinds of neurosteroids (for example, pregnenolone sulfate, allopregnanolone) have weak ameliorating effects in the animal models of learning impairment (active avoidance test, the radial-arm maze test, and water maze test) [Flood, J. F. et al., Brain Res., 448f 178-181 (1988); Flood, J. F. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., M, 1567-1571 (1992); Romeo, E. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 270r 89-96 (1994)]*<br>
Until now, a lot of studies on the function of BZco3 receptors have been reported, and hence it has been shown<br>
that in the brain, BZco3 receptors often exist on the outer membrane of mitochondria in the glial cells and are involved in the uptake of cholesterol into the inner membrane of mitochondria, and then affect the biosynthesis of neurosteroids such as pregnenolone and consequently allopregnanolone and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone. That is to say, it is considered that the stimulation onto the   BZco3   receptor   promotes   the   biosynthesis   of<br><br>
neurosteroids in the brain, and these neurosteroids bind to the neurosteroid-recognition site (different site from the<br>
benzodiazepine receptor) in the complex of Y~amin°kutyric acid A  (hereinafter optionally abbreviated to "GABA-A") receptor - benzodiazepine receptor - Cl-ionchannel and affect the Cl-channel opening process [Romeo, E. et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 2£Zf   971-978 (1992)].<br>
Since BZco3 receptor agonists modulate the function of GABA-A receptors via the biosynthesis of neurosteroids, it<br>
is suggested that the BZco3 receptor agonists could be possibly used as anxiolytics, antidepressants, hypnotics, antiepileptics, etc. For example, WO 99/28320 discloses that 2-aryl-8-oxodihydropurine derivatives of the formula<br>
(I), are selective and high-affinity BZco3 receptor agonists and are useful as medicines for treatment of, for example, anxiety-related disorders and depression.<br>
In addition to the above, there are some other reports<br>
indicating  that  the  BZ<jd3 receptor agonists exhibit anxiolytic actions but it is scarcely reported that said an ameliorating effect on learning impairments except for the above report as to fgin-1-27. disclosure of invention></jd3>
The BZco3 receptor agonists have a different mechanism of action from those of the known anti-dementia medicines, and then it seems that it is possible to provide a useful<br><br>
anti-dementia medicine with a different property from the current medicine for dementia, if a compound with a potent ameliorating effect on dementia could be found among them.<br>
The present inventors have extensively studied to find out the compound having a potent ameliorating effect on<br>
dementia among the known BZco3 receptor agonists, and have found that 2-aryl-8-oxodihydropurine derivatives of the formula (I) and pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof exhibit unexpectedly potent ameliorating effects on learning and/or memory impairments in animals, said impairments being induced by the systemic administration of MK-801 [dizocilpine maleate; ( + )-5-methyl-10,ll-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptane-5,10-imine maleate] which is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist and (-)-scopolamine hydrobromide (hereinafter abbreviated to "scopolamine") which is a competitive acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Based upon the new findings, the present invention has been completed.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a medicine for the treatment of dementia comprising a 2-aryl-8-oxodihydropurine derivative which exhibits an extremely potent ameliorating effect on learning and/or memory impairments induced by hypofunction of glutamatergic system or cholinergic system and is useful for the treatment of dementia (e.g. cognitive impairment), such as Alzheimer-<br><br>
type dementia, cerebrovascular dementia and senile dementia. This and other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent to a person skilled in the art, from the following description.<br>

Learning/memory impairments in animals are usually induced by systemic administration of MK-801 (a noncompetitive antagonist for NMDA receptor which is a subtype of glutamic acid receptor) and scopolamine (a competitive  antagonist  for  acetylcholine  receptor),  or<br>
intracerebral injection of [3-amyloid peptide [Stephanie, D. et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 319r 1-4 (1997)].<br>
Experiment  1:  Ameliorating  effect  on  spatial  memory<br>
disorder induced by scopolamine.<br>
The spatial memory test using Y-maze apparatus is a test to utilize the behavioral property of animals to enter into a new arm, avoiding the arm that they entered into just before (alternation behavior). This method is often used in order to study spatial working memory.<br>
This experiment was carried out according to the method of It oh, J. , et al. [Eur. J. Pharmacol. , 236f 341-345 (1993)].<br><br>
Std-ddY male mice weighing 25 - 30 g (8 mice per one group) were used in the experiment. A solution of scopolamine in physiological saline (concentration : 0.06 mg/ml) was subcutaneously administered to mice in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 g of body weight, i.e. , 0.6 mg/kg. Mice in the test compound group were orally treated with the test compound suspended in 0.5 % tragacanth solution in a volume of 0.1 ml/10 g of body weight 1 hour before scopolamine administration, while animals in the amnesia control group and the vehicle control group received a 0.5 % tragacanth solution in the same manner as above. However, the vehicle control group was injected with physiological saline instead of scopolamine. Thirty minutes after administration of scopolamine, the mice were placed at the end of the arm A of the Y-maze apparatus which was composed of three black acrylic trapezoid arms (bottom width : 3 cm, height of side wall : 12 cm, width of opened ceiling : 10 cm, length : 40 cm), wherein said three arms were connected at the one end of each arm to form Y-shape and another ends were closed, and the three arms were differentiated by the names as A, B and C respectively, and allowed to search freely the maze for 8 minutes. When the mouse was checked to enter into an arm at the length of not less than 10 cm from the entrance of the arm, the name of the arm (A, B or C) was recorded.  It could be defined as a correct choice<br><br>
when the mouse selected the different three arms sequentially, and the number of alternation behavior i.e., the number of correct choices was counted. In the case that the total number of arm entries was less than 10 [the maximum number of alternation behavior (the number obtained by subtracting 2 from the total number of arm entries) is less than 8], the resulting data were not used and the retest was carried out instead, because the ability of learning could not occasionally reflect the alternation behavior. For the final data gotten, the ratio of the number of the alternation behavior to that of the entries (obtained by subtracting 2 from the total number of arm entries) was estimated as the rate of alternation behavior. In statistical analysis, the rate of alternation behavior in the amnesia control group was compared with that in the vehicle control group by the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test and it was checked if a significant amnesia was induced in the amnesia control group. Next, the efficacy of the test compounds was evaluated in comparison between the amnesia control group and the test compound group by the nonparametric Dunnett multiple comparison test. The statistical calculation was carried out with SAS system Version 6.12 (SAS Institute Japan Ltd.). Table 1 shows the minimum effective dose (MED) , at which the significant ameliorating effect of the test compound on<br><br>
scopolamine-induced spatial memory disorder was observed at 5 % significance level in the rate of alternation behavior. The rate of alternation behavior in the amnesia control group with scopolamine significantly decreased to 40 - 47 % while 61 - 70 % in the vehicle control group, and hence, it was confirmed that the hypofunction of cholinergic system caused spatial memory disorder.<br><br>
The test compounds A - E exhibited a more potent ameliorating effect (MED 
Experiment 2: Ameliorating effect on object memory disorder induced by scopolamine.<br>
The object recognition test is a test method using the property which animals like to search a novel object. This method is often used in order to study the memorization and retention of episodic memory.<br>
This experiment was  carried out according to the partially  modified  method  of  Bartolini,  L.  et  al. [Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav., 52.,   277-283 (1996)].<br><br>
Std-ddY male mice weighing 25 - 30 g (six mice per one group) were used in the experiment. Scopolamine dissolved in physiological saline (concentration : 0.04 mg/ml) was subcutaneously administered to mice in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight, i.e., 0.4 mg/kg. For the test compound group, the test compound suspended in 0.5 % tragacanth solution was orally administered in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight, 30 minutes before scopolamine administration, and for the amnesia control group and the vehicle control group, a 0.5 % tragacanth solution was administered in the same manner as above. However, for the vehicle control group, physiological saline was administered instead of scopolamine. Thirty minutes after the administration of scopolamine, the first trial was carried out for 5 minutes, and 1 hour after the first trial, the second trial was carried out for 5 minutes. In the first trial, the two same-shaped objects [red frustum-formed funnel adaptors made of silicon (bottom diameter : 6.1 cm, ceiling diameter : 4.5 cm, height : 3.5 cm)] are put on the two adjacent corners of the test box made of brown acrylic (length : 22.5 cm, width : 24.5 cm, height : 11 cm) , and the time that the mouse explored each object was measured. In the second trial, the object (familiar : F) which the exploration time was longer in the first trial was retained, while another object in the first<br><br>
trial was replaced by the novel object [novel : N, red diver ring (outside diameter : 7.5 cm, inside diameter : 2.5 cm, thickness : 2.0 cm)] at the same position, and then the time for exploring each object was measured. The rate of object memory impairment was obtained from the formula: (N-F)/(N+F) as a discrimination index, and the comparison between the vehicle control group and the amnesia control group, and between the amnesia control group and the test compound group was carried out on the basis of said discrimination index.<br>
In statistical analysis, the comparison between the vehicle control group and the amnesia control group was carried out by the Student's t test and it was checked whether a significant amnesia was induced. The efficacy of the test compounds was evaluated on the basis of comparison between the amnesia control group and the test compound group by the parametric Dunnett's multiple comparison test. The statistical calculation was carried out with SAS system Version 6.12 (SAS Institute Japan Ltd.). Table 2 shows the minimum effective dose (MED), which the significant difference in the discrimination index, as an ameliorating effect of the test compound on scopolamine-induced object memory impairment, was observed at 5 % significance level.<br>
The discrimination index in the scopolamine-induced amnesia group significantly decreased to 0.00 - 0.07 while<br><br>
it was 0.49 - 0.71 in the vehicle control group, and hence, it was confirmed that the hypofunction of cholinergic system caused obj ect memory impairment. Table 2<br><br>
The test compound E exhibited a significant ameliorating effect at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg and the test compound C exhibited a significant ameliorating effect at low dose of 0.01 mg/kg. However, FGIN-1-27 exhibited no significant ameliorating effect at the dose of 30 mg/kg. Experiment 3: Ameliorating effect on the impairment of object location memory induced by MK-801.<br>
The object location memory test is a test method using the property which animals like to search a novelty caused by the change of an object location. This method is often used in order to study the ability of object location memory. This method is closely related with hypofunction of glutamatergic system and cause the location memory impairment selectively without the impairment of object memory which is induced by hypofunction of cholinergic system.<br>
This experiment was carried out according to the partially modified method of Sophie L. Dix, et al. [Behav. Brain Res., 22, 191-200 (1999)].<br><br>
Std-ddY male mice weighing 25 - 30 g (six mice per one group) were used in the experiment. A solution of MK-8 01 in physiological saline (concentration : 0.005 mg/ml) was subcutaneously administered in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight, i.e., 0.05 mg/kg. For the test compound group, the test compound suspended in 0.5 % tragacanth solution was orally administered in a volume of 0.1 ml per 10 g of body weight, 30 minutes before MK-801 administration, and for the amnesia control group and the vehicle control group, a 0.5 % tragacanth solution was administered in the same manner as above. However, for the vehicle control group, physiological saline was administered instead of MK-801. Thirty minutes after the administration of MK-801, the first trial was carried out for 5 minutes, and 1 hour after the first trial, the second trial was carried out for 5 minutes. In the first trial, the two same-shaped objects [red frustum-formed funnel adaptors made of silicon (bottom diameter : 6.1 cm, ceiling diameter : 4.5 cm, height : 3.5 cm)] were respectively put in the center and one of the corners of the test box made of brown acrylic (length : 22.5 cm, width : 24.5 cm, height : 11 cm), and the time which the mouse explored each object was measured. In the second trial, the object (displaced object : DO) which was located in the center in the first trial was displaced in the opposite corner to<br><br>
another object (non displaced object : NDO) , and then the time which the mouse explored each object was measured. The difference in the exploration time of DO and NDO respectively between the first trial and the second trial was calculated, and the comparison between the vehicle control group and the amnesia control group, and between the amnesia control group and the test compound group was carried out.<br>
In statistical analysis, the comparison between the vehicle control group and the amnesia control group was carried out by the Student's t test and it was confirmed whether a significant object location memory impairment was induced. The efficacy of the test compounds was evaluated by comparing the amnesia control group with the test compound group using the parametric Dunnett's multiple comparison test. The statistical calculation was carried out with SAS system Version 6.12 (SAS Institute Japan Ltd.). Table 3 shows the minimum effective dose (MED), which a significant ameliorating effect on MK-801-induced object location memory impairment was observed at 5 % significance level.<br>
Besides, in the vehicle control group, the exploration time for NDO in the second trial decreased and the exploration time for DO was obviously longer than that for NDO.  This result indicates that the change of the object<br><br>
location has a novelty and animals explored the object with novelty frequently. On the other hand, in the amnesia control group with MK-801, both exploration time for NDO and DO decreased remarkably. From these results, it was confirmed that MK-801 did not impair the memory of object itself, but impaired the memory of the object location.<br><br>
The test compound C exhibited a significant ameliorating effect at the dose of 0.1 mg/kg and the test compound E exhibited a significant ameliorating effect at low dose of 0.01 mg/kg, furthermore they were effective at less than 1/100 of the dose of FGIN-1-27. Experiment 4: Acute toxicity<br>
The experiment on the test compound C was carried out using Std-ddY male mice weighing 25 - 30 g (10 mice per each group). The test compound suspended in 0.5 % tragacanth solution was orally administered at the dose of 2000 mg/kg, and lethality of mice was observed for 7 days after the administration. As a result, no mouse treated with the test compound C died. Experiment 5: Acute toxicity 2<br>
The experiment on the test compound E was carried out using Std-ddY male mice weighing 22.9 - 25.6 g (5 mice per<br><br>
each group) and Std-Wistar male rats weighing 126.6 - 136.6 g (5 rats per each group). The test compound suspended in 0.5 % tragacanth solution was orally and intraperitoneally administered to the mice at the dose of 2000 mg/kg, and lethality of mice was observed for 7 days after the administration. As a result, no mouse treated with the test compound E died.<br>
As is apparent from the above results, the compounds of the formula (I) exhibit an extremely potent ameliorating effects on learning and/or memory impairments induced by the systemic administration of MK-801 (noncompetitive antagonist for NMDA receptors, a subtype of glutamate receptors) and scopolamine (competitive antagonist for acetylcholine receptors) even at a low dose and further have a low toxicity, and hence, the compounds will be useful as a medicine for treatment and prevention of learning and/or memory impairments in mammals (including human beings) , and also for treatment and prevention of dementia.
