THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCIRBES AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN<br>
WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED: -<br><br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a pyridine alcohol derivative. The pyridine derivatives produced by the present invention are useful as intermediates in the synthesis of compounds having a pyridine skeleton in the molecule, such as furopyridine derivatives having antiviral activity (see WO 96/35678).<br>
Several methods have been disclosed in the past as methods for the synthesis of condensed pyridines such as furopyridines (see Heterocycles, 45(5) (1997), p. 975), but the only known methods for producing 5-substituted furo [2,3-c]pyridines which can be converted to the aforementioned furopyridine derivatives having antiviral activity are methods in which synthesis is achieved through multiple stages using 2-chloro-3-hydroxypyridine as the starting material (see WO 96/35678), and methods in which furfural oxime as the starting material is made into 5-substituted furo[2,3-c]pyridine-N-oxide as a result of ring formation by the Aza Diels-Alder reaction and<br><br>
subsequent dehydrogenation (see Tetrahedron Lett., 32, 3199(1991)).<br>
Problems in the former of the aforementioned methods, however, are the large number of steps as well as the expensive starting materials and reaction agents, while the latter method needs expensive dehydrogenating agents such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-p-benzoquinone (DDQ), and needs the reduction of the pyridine oxide to pyridine, and hence both methods cannot be considered to be industrially useful.<br>

Production method of the present invention is described in each step in detail below.<br>
Step (a): Step for producing an imine derivative VI by subjecting an aldehyde derivative IX and a primary amine X to dehydration condensation.<br>
This conversion can be carried out in the same way as in methods commonly used to obtain an imine compound from an aldehyde and a primary amine. For example, the aldehyde derivative IX and the primary amine X are mixed in the presence or absence of a solvent and in the presence or absence of a dehydrating agent.  Suitable solvents are those which give no undesired effect on the reaction, including aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as pentane, hexane, heptane and ligroin; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene and chlorobenzene; ether solvents such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; alcohol solvents such as methanol and ethanol; ester solvents such as methyl<br><br>
acetate, ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; or a mixture thereof. Suitable dehydrating agents include silica gel, molecular sieves, alumina, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, copper sulfate, sodium hydroxide, or potassium hydroxide. The reaction can also be carried out in an azeotropic solvent with water while removing water by azeotropic dehydration.<br>
Examples of the primary amines X include methylamine, ethylamine, propylamine, n-buthylamine, n-hexylamine, n-octylamine, aniline, p-chloroaniline, p-methoxyaniline, p-methylaniline and p-nitroaniline.<br>
The resulting imine derivative VI is isolated and purified from the reaction mixture in the usual manner which commonly used in the isolation and purification of organic compounds. For example, the imine derivatives VI can be obtained by separating insoluble material contained in the reaction mixture by filtration, concentrating the filtrate and then purifing the residue by<br>
recrystallization, chromatography, or the like. The crude product can also be used without purification as such in subsequent reactions. When the imine derivative VI is precipitated from the reaction mixture, it is filtered, purified by recrystallization if necessary, and then can be used in the subsequent reaction.<br><br>
Step (b): Step for producing a pyridine derivative I by reacting an imine derivative VI with a carbonylating agent VII and a nitrile VIII<br>
Examples of carbonylating agents VII include carboxylic anhydrides such as acetic anhydride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, valeric anhydride and trifluoroacetic anhydride; carboxylic acid halides such as acetyl chloride, acetyl bromide, propionyl chloride, propionyl bromide, butyryl chloride, isobutyryl chloride, valeryl chloride, isovaleryl chloride, pivaloyl chloride, benzoyl chloride and benzoyl bromide; halogenoformic acid esters such as methyl chloroformate, ethyl chloroformate, propyl chloroformate, isopropyl chloroformate, butyl chloroformate, allyl chloroformate, phenyl chloroformate, nitrophenyl chloroformate and benzyl chloroformate; and carbamic acid halides such as N,N-dimethylcarbamyl chloride; among these chloroformic acid esters are preferred.<br>
The amount of carbonylating agent VII may be used within a range of preferably 0.5 to 20 mol, and more preferably 1.1 to 10 mol, based on one mole of the imine derivative VI.<br>
Examples of nitriles VIII include alkylsulfonylcyanides such as methanesulfonylcyanide, ethanesulfonylcyanide, propanesulfonylcyanide,<br><br>
butanesulfonylcyanide, tert-butanesulfonylcyanide, and dodecanesulfonylcyanide; arylsulfonylcyanides such as benzenesulfonylcyanide, toluenesulfonylcyanide, chlorobenzenesulfonylcyanide, nitrobenzenesulfonylcyanide and naphthalenesulfonylcyanide; aralkylsulfonylcyanides such as benzylsulfonylcyanide and<br>
nitrobenzylsulfonylcyanide; cyanoformic acid esters such as methyl cyanoformate, ethyl cyanoformate, propyl cyanoformate, isopropyl cyanoformate, butyl cyanoformate, allyl cyanoformate, phenyl cyanoformate, nitrophenyl cyanoformate and benzyl cyanoformate. The amount of nitrile VIII may be used within a range of preferably 0.5 to 20 mol, and more preferably 1.1 to 10 mol, based on one mole of the imine derivative VI.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a solvent. The solvent is not particularly limited, provided that the reaction is not adversely affected, examples of which include aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, mesitylene and chlorobenzene; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; amides such as dimethyl formamide and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone; and dimethyl sulfoxide. The amount of the solvent is not particularly limited, although it is usually used within a rage of preferably 1 to 200 times by weight based on the imine derivative VI.<br><br>
The reaction temperature may vary, depending on the solvent, the carbonylating agent VII, and the nitrile VIII<br>
that is used, but is preferably within a range of 40Â°C to the reflux temperature of the reaction system. The reaction can be carried out in a pressurized or reduced pressure state. The reaction time may vary, depending on the reaction temperature, but is usually rages from 30 minutes to 24 hours. The reaction time can be controlled by properly controlling the reaction temperature.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the following manner, for example. That is, the carbonylating agent VII is added dropwise to a mixed solution of the nitrile VIII and the imine derivative VI within a temperature range from under ice cooling to the refluxing temperature of the reaction mixture, and after the completion of addition, the mixture is heated to the desired temperature until the imine derivative VI disappears.<br>
The resulting pyridine derivative I is isolated and purified from the reaction mixture in the usual manner which commonly used in the isolation and purification of organic compounds. For example, after cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, it is washed with sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution and saline water. Then, the solvent is distilled off, and the residue is purified by recrystallization, chromatography, or the like. When<br><br>
the product is precipitated from the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture can be cooled and then filtered with the addition of a poor solvent if necessary.<br>

The reaction temperature may vary, depending on the solvent, the reducing agent, the alkylating agent, the alkenylating agent, the arylating agent or the aralkylating agent that is used, but a temperature is<br>
usually preferred within a range of -100Â°C to the refluxing temperature of the solvent. The reaction can be carried out in a pressurized or reduced pressure state. The reaction time also may vary, depending on the reaction temperature, but is usually range from 30 minutes to 24<br><br>
hours. The reaction time can be controlled by properly controlling of the reaction temperature.<br>

Step (d) : Step for producing a pyridine alcohol derivative III by reacting a pyridine carbonyl derivative II with a reducing agent, an alkylating agent, an<br><br>

The solvent is not particularly limited, provided that the reaction is not adversely affected, examples of which include alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol and isopropanol; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, dibutyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-diethoxyethane and diethylene glycol dimethyl ether; and hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, benzene, toluene, and xylene. The amount of solvent is not particularly limited, although it is preferably used within a range of 1 to 200 times by weight based on the pyridine carbonyl derivative II.<br>
The reaction temperature may vary, depending on the solvent, the reducing agent, the alkylating agent, the alkenylating agent, the arylating agent or the aralkylating agent that is used, but a temperature is<br>
preferred within a range of -100Â°C to the refluxing temperature of the solvent. The reaction can be carried out in a pressurized or reduced pressure state. The reaction time also may vary, depending on the reaction<br><br>
temperature, but is usually range from 30 minutes to 24 hours. The reaction time can be controlled by properly controlling of the reaction temperature.<br>
The resulting pyridine alcohol derivative III is isolated and purified from the reaction mixture in the usual manner which commonly used in the isolation and purification of organic compounds. For example, after returning the reaction mixture to room temperature, the reaction mixture is then added to an acidic aqueous solution such as aqueous ammonium chloride and is hydrolyzed, it is then extracted with an  organic solvent such as diethyl ether or ethyl acetate, the extract is washed with sodium bicarbonate aqueous solution and saline water, the solvent is distilled off, and the residue is purified by distillation, recrystallization, chromatography, or the like.<br>
Step (e): Step for producing a pyridine (3-ketoester derivative V by reacting a pyridine ester derivative 1-1 with an ester compound IV in the presence of a base.<br>
Examples of bases include alkali metals such as sodium, lithium, and potassium; alkaline earth metals such as calcium; metal alcoholates such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, sodium propoxide, sodium isopropoxide, sodium butoxide, sodium tert-butoxide, sodium benzyloxide, potassium methoxide, potassium ethoxide, potassium<br><br>
propoxide, potassium isopropoxide, potassium butoxide and potassium tert-butoxide; organic magnesium halides such as methylmagnesium bromide, ethylmagnesium bromide, isopropylmagnesium bromide, and mesitylmagnesium bromide; metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; and metal amides such as sodium amide, potassium amide, and lithium diisopropylamide. The amount of base is preferably used within a range of 0.5 to 10 mol, and more preferably 1 to 3 mol, based on  one mole of the pyridine ester derivative 1-1.<br>
The ester compound IV is an ester compound derived from a carboxylic acid having a hydrogen atom in the alpha position, preferably an ester compound, such as a methyl ester, ethyl ester, propyl ester, isopropyl ester, butyl ester, isobutyl ester, 2-methylpropyl ester, tert-butyl ester, phenyl ester, benzyl ester, or chlorophenyl ester of a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, 2-methylpropionic acid, valeric acid, isovaleric acid, caproic acid, or phenylacetic acid. Among these, aliphatic lower alcohol asters such as methyl esters, ethyl esters, propyl esters, isopropyl esters, butyl esters, isobutyl esters, 2-nethylpropyl esters and tert-butyl esters are preferred.<br>
The amount of ester compound IV is used preferably within a range of 0.5 to 10 mol, and more preferably 1 to<br><br>
3 mol, based on one mole of the pyridine ester derivative 1-1.<br>
Although the reaction in this step can be carried out in the absence of a solvent, it is preferably carried out in the presence of a solvent.<br>
Solvents are not particularly limited, provided that the reaction is not adversely affected, examples of which include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, octane and ligroin; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene and mesitylene; ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and dioxane; polyethers such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, triethylene glycol diethyl ether and tetraethylene glycol diethyl ether; and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and t-butanol. Among these, the use of aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers, and polyethers as the solvent is preferred in view of the reaction rate, solubility of the pyridine derivative I, and the like. The amount of solvent is not particularly limited, provided that it is an amount allowing the pyridine ester derivative 1-1 to dissolve under the reaction conditions, although it is preferably used within<br><br>
a range of 0.5 to 1000 times by weight, and more preferably 0.5 to 100 times by weight, based on the pyridine ester derivative 1-1.<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably within a range<br>
of 0 to 200Â°C, and more preferably 10 to 150Â°C.<br>
The reaction in this step is not limited to any particular method, examples of which include: (1) mixing the prescribed amounts of the pyridine ester derivative I-1, the base, the ester compound IV and a solvent, and allowing the mixture to react at the prescribed temperature; (2) dissolving the prescribed amount of the pyridine ester derivative 1-1 in a solvent, adding the base to the solution, heating the solution to the desired temperature, and then adding the ester compound IV all at once, intermittently or continuously, either as such or dissolved in a solvent; and (3) dissolving the prescribed amount of the base in the solvent, adding the ester compound IV to the solution, heating the solution to the desired temperature, and then adding the pyridine ester derivative I-1 all at once, intermittently, or continuously, either as such or dissolved in a solvent, to bring about the reaction.<br>
The resulting pyridine |3-ketoester derivative V can be readily isolated by neutralizing the reaction solution with the addition of an equivalent amount of acid relative<br><br>
to the base that was used, by then extracting the product with methylene chloride, toluene, xylene, benzene, chloroform, pentane, hexane, heptane or the like, and by concentrating the extract. Examples of acids which can be used for such purposes include carboxylic acids such as acetic acid and formic acid, and inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid. The purity of the product can be increased by recrystallization, if necessary.<br>
Under these reaction conditions, depending on the combination of the pyridine ester derivative 1-1, the base, and the ester compound IV, as well as the proportions in which they are used, especially when using a metal alcoholate as the base or when using an alcohol as the solvent, a transesterification reaction sometimes progresses between the group represented by -X in the pyridine ester derivative 1-1, the group represented by -<br>
3<br>
OR in the ester compound IV, the alcoholate moiety of the metal alcoholate and the alcohol.  In such cases, the product can become a mixture of various types of moieties<br>
represented by -OR in the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V, but the purity of such mixtures can be readily increased by common separation and purification means such as distillation, column chromatography, and recrystallization. These mixtures may also be used<br><br>
without any problems in the next step (f) for obtaining the pyridine carbonyl derivative II.<br>
Step (f): Step for producing a pyridine carbonyl derivative II by hydrolysis and decarboxylation of a<br>
pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V.<br>
The amount of water that is used for hydrolysis is not particularly limited, although the use of at least one<br>
mole based on one mole of the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V is preferred in view of obtaining the target pyridine carbonyl derivative II with good yields, and no more than 100 mol water based on one mole of the pyridine<br>
Î²-ketoester derivative V is usually preferred in view of the reaction rate, the extraction efficiency following the reaction, the volume efficiency of the equipment, and the like.<br>
Any common acid or base used in the hydrolysis of esters can be used in the hydrolysis reaction. Examples of acids include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, and acidic gases such as hydrogen chloride gas can also be used. Examples of bases include alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
The intermediate product obtained by the hydrolysis<br>
of the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V is unstable under these reaction conditions, and the pyridine carbonyl<br><br>
derivative II is produced as a result of the rapid progress of the decarboxylation, thus allowing the decarboxylation to be carried out, usually at the same time as the hydrolysis, in the same reactor using the unmodified acid or base used in the hydrolysis. More acid or base can be added during the reaction to promote the hydrolysis and decarboxylation. The type of acid or base that is added at such times may be the same as, or different from, the acid or base initially used in the hydrolysis and decarboxylation. The amount of acid or base may be used within a range of preferably 0.001 to 100 mol, and more preferably 0.01 to 10 mol, based on one mole<br>
of the pyridine (3-ketoester derivative V.<br>
Methods for carrying out the reaction include methods<br>
in which the hydrolysis and decarboxylation are first started under basic conditions, and excess acid is added to the reaction system midway during the reaction to bring about acidic conditions, and methods in which the hydrolysis and decarboxylation are first started under acidic conditions, and excess base is added to the reaction system midway during the reaction to bring about basic conditions.<br>
To obtain the pyridine carbonyl derivative II, a<br>
reaction mixture containing the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V is obtained by means of the reaction in step<br><br>
(e), and water and an acid or base are then added to the<br>
reaction solution without separating the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V from the reaction mixture to carry out the hydrolysis and decarboxylation in step (f), allowing the pyridine carbonyl derivative II to be obtained.<br>
When the hydrolysis and decarboxylation in step (f)<br>
are then carried out without isolating the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V from the reaction mixture obtained<br>
in the reaction in step (e), the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V contained in the reaction mixture is quantified and analyzed, and the acid or base is used in an amount within the range described above relative to that amount. The amount of acid or base may be used within a range of preferably 0.001 to 100 mol, and more preferably 0.01 to 10 mol, based on one mole of the pyridine ester derivative 1-1 used in step (e). The amount of water is used within a range of preferably 1 to<br>
100 mol based on the amount of the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V contained in the reaction mixture. Water may also be used within a range of preferably 1 to 100 mol based on one mole of the pyridine ester derivative 1-1. Because a base is already present in the reaction<br>
mixture containing the pyridine Î²-ketoester derivative V obtained in step (e), the addition of water allows the<br><br>
existing base to act as a promoter in the hydrolysis and decarboxylation. In this embodiment, the neutralization in step (e) can be omitted.<br>
The hydrolysis and decarboxylation may be carried out in the presence of an organic solvent. The type of organic solvent is not particularly limited, provided that the reaction is not adversely affected, examples of which include aliphatic hydrocarbons such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, octane and ligroin; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene, cumene and mesitylene; ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; polyethers such as ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, triethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, triethylene glycol diethyl ether and tetraethylene glycol diethyl ether; and alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol and t-butanol. Among these, the use of aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers and polyethers is preferred in view of the reaction rate,<br>
solubility of the pyridine p-ketoester derivative V, and the like. The amount of solvent is not particularly limited, although it is preferably used within a range of<br>
0.5 to 100 weight parts based on the pyridine p-ketoester derivative V or the pyridine ester derivative 1-1.<br><br>
When the hydrolysis and decarboxylation in step (f)<br>
are then carried out without isolating the pyridine (3-ketoester derivative V from the reaction mixture obtained in the reaction in step (e), the solvent used in step (e) can be used as such in step (f).<br>
The reaction temperature is preferably within a range<br>
of 0 to 200Â°C/ and more preferably 10 to 150Â°C.<br>
The resulting pyridine carbonyl derivative II is isolated and purified from the reaction mixture in the usual manner which commonly used in the isolation and purification of organic compounds. For example, after cooling the reaction mixture to room temperature, it is extracted with an organic solvent such as methylene chloride, toluene, xylene, benzene, chloroform, pentane, hexane or heptane, the extract is washed with saline water, the solvent is distilled off, and the residue is purified by distillation, recrystallization, chromatography, or the like.<br>
The pyridine carbonyl derivative II thus obtained can be converted to the corresponding pyridine alcohol derivative III by using the procedures in step (d).<br>
Of the pyridine derivative represented by the General Formula 1-2 contained the pyridine derivative I, for example, 5-benzenesulfonylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine can be converted to the intermediate noted in International<br><br>
Unexamined Patent Application WO 96/35678 by the following method, and a compound having antiviral activity can be derived by the method noted in the same application.<br>
That is, 5-benzenesulfonylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine is converted to 5-cyanofuro[2,3-c]pyridine by reacting with an alkali metal cyanide. The cyanation can be carried out with or without a solvent. The solvent is not particularly limited, provided that the reaction is not adversely affected, examples of which include polar solvents such as dimethyl formamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, l,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidione. This reaction can also be carried out as a two-phase reaction using an phase-transfer catalyst. The reaction is carried out by heating 5-benzenesulfonylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine and an excess amount of an alkali metal cyanide at a temperature within a range of room temperature to the reflux temperature. The resulting 5-cyanofuro[2,3-c]pyridine can be converted to 5-acetylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine by reacting with a methylating agent such as methyllithium or methylmagnesium chloride. The amount of the methylating agent is preferably within a range of 0.8 to 2 mol based on the starting pyridine derivative.<br>
5-Acetylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine can be synthesized by reacting an acetyl anion equivalent with<br><br>
5-benzenesulfonylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine, and then subsequent deprotection. Conventional acetyl anion equivalents can be used as the acetyl anion equivalent, although preferred examples include lactonitrile cyanhydrin ether, and acetyl anion equivalents prepared from an acetaldehyde thioacetal, thioacetal monoxide or the like and a strong base such as butyllithium, tert-butyllithium, methyllithium, phenyllithium, lithium diisopropylamide, lithium hexamethyldisilazide or sodium hexamethyldisilazide. The acetyl anion equivalent is preferably used in an amount of 0.8 to 2 mol based on one mole of the starting pyridine derivative.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in a solvent that does not adversely affect the reaction, examples of such solvents preferably including ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and dioxane. The reaction temperature is preferably within the range of -<br>
40Â°C to 100Â°C.<br>
The resulting product is subsequently treated and deprotected by a common method, and the resulting 5-acetylfuro[2,3-c]pyridine can be converted to the intermediate by reduction with sodium borohydride, diisobutyl aluminum hydride, lithium aluminum hydride or the like noted in International Unexamined Patent Application WO 96/35678.<br><br>
