				<td>The present invention relates to a device to measure the reaction rate kinetics and the non-isothermal kinetic parameters. Most of the metallurgical and chemical processes involve non-isothermal vertical reactors and contain heterogeneous reacting system. The reaction rate kinetics affects the productivity and energy consumption of these processes. This invention will thus be useful to measure the reaction rate kinetics and non-isothermal kinetic parameters under a given time-temperature programme simulating the vertical reactor comprising heterogeneous reaction system.<br>
BACKGROUN OF THE INVENTION<br>
Conventionally, the reaction rate kinetics and non-isothermal kinetic parameters of heterogeneous reaction system are determined by isothermal standard set up viz. in case of ironmaking process (i) standard iron ore reducibility set up, (ii) char coke reactivity set up, (iii) thermal analyser, and (iv) fixed time kinetic studies using muffle furnaces. The standard iron ore reducibility set-up consists of the stainless steel or inconel tube containing ore samples placed in the furnace hot zone. The tube is suspended from a balance which records its weight variation continuously. The reaction mixture is first kept, under an inert atmosphere until the desired temperature is attained. Once the temperature is stabilized the reducing gas could be introduced. Both the inert gas and the reducing gas are purified prior to their entry into the reduction tube. The product gases are released through outlets and the temperatures are measured by the thermocouples. The schematic diagram is shown in Fig.l. It comprises a reaction tube (1) closed at the bottom with an opening (11) at the top for the outlets of the reaction gases kept inside furnace (2) with a temperature recorder and controller (6) and (7) hanged from the balance (3) for determining the weight loss using recorder (8) having thermocouples (10) embedded in the reaction mass (4) and the refractory balls (5) along with the temperature recorder (9). This set up is used mainly for isothermal reduction of iron ore by CO-N2 (30:70) mixture.<br>
In similar set up isothermal gasification can be carried out by heating representative samples of char prepared by carbonization of coal sample in a stainless steel reactor which is suspended from a balance.. Initially the reaction mass is heated in a current of nitrogen. When the temperature reaches a preset value the gas inlet is connected to the<br>
carbon dioxide supply, adjusting the flow. The weight change is measured at regular interval during the course of the oxidation reaction.<br>
Thermal analysis device is used for identification of sequential and partially overlapping reactions and also in the examination of reactor mechanics. Fig. 2 shows the conventional thermal analysis for the study of the reaction kinetics under linear rate of heating. The reduction under isothermal and fluctuating temperature conditions can be done using muffle fiimace where the reaction mass are chemically analyzed from the degree of reduction.<br>
The major drawbacks of the hither-to-known devices are as below:<br>
♦	These devices mostly employ idealized and standard isothermal reaction conditions using rather a small size of reaction mass<br>
♦	It cannot undertake such process as employ actual raw material and nonideal experimental conditions.<br>
♦	It cannot employ non-isothermal reaction conditions normally prevalent in several industrial processes.<br>
♦	The above devices cannot essentially simulate the conditions akin to real life reactors wherein the heterogeneous bulk quantity of reaction mass having large particle size undergoes normally non-isothermal time-temperature programming including fluctuating temperature conditions.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a moving bed system device to measure the reaction rate kinetics and the non-isothermal kinetic parameters . Another object of the present invention is to provide a device to measure the reaction rate kinetics and the non-isothermal kinetic parameters under a given time-temperature programme simulating the vertical reactor comprising the heterogeneous reaction system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
. The present invention provides a device to measure the reaction rate kinetics and the non-isothermal kinetic parameters which comprises a capsule (1) closed at bottom having cage (13) partitioned with perforated plates (9) containing test sample and assembly of four pipes (6,7,8), (6) referring to two pipes containing a thermocouple placed inside the cage in such a way that one of the thermocouples is placed along the inner surface of the cage and another thermocouple at pipe (6) is placed along the axis of the cage, pipe (7,8) are provided for gas inlet and outlet respectively, the whole assembly is fitted into the said capsule (1) with an annular gap of 2-3 mm between them, the said capsule (1) is placed and moved in the furnace (2) at a linear speed ranging between 2 to 20 mm/min by known means (3,4,5<br>
The device in the present invention follows the moving bed system to measure the non-isothermal kinetic parameters and reaction rate kinetics. In this system the reactions take place simultaneously at many volume elements each of which eventually go through identical time-temperature schedule. The device to measure the reaction rate kinetics and the non-isothermal kinetic parameters consists of a stainless steel capsule made of steel or inconel containing the reaction mixture which can move vertically downward into a furnace hot zone in a vertical retort. At a given depth higher temperatures are reached when the speed is less. Slower speeds are allowed for more heat transfer. At higher speeds a given volume element is exposed to hotter region sooner. Therefore it attains a higher temperature at a given time. There is always a temperature difference between the periphery and the center. The former being at high temperature. This difference decreases considerably when higher temperatures are reached. When the capsule is fully inside the furnace, its movement is abruptly stopped. It is then quickly withdrawn and quenched by nitrogen gas. The samples of the reacted mass taken from different location of the capsule along the length then represent the state of the system from zero time at the top to a maximum at the leading edge when the reactions take place under the conditions of increasing temperature and then by using known formula reaction rate kinetics and non-isothermal kinetic parameters can be measured using the present invention.<br>
The device of the present invention provide some essential information of the composite situation of a continuous reaction and the total sample, after removal, would represent a frozen picture of the steady state situation. A visual examination of the sample will provide information such as melt down or fusion, the onset of other physical and chemical changes which leave visible clue, etc.<br>
The moving bed concept can be used to design horizontal or vertical reactors. The horizontal reactors in the moving bed concept are beyond the scope of the present invention.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the device to measure the reaction rate kinetics and non-isothermal kinetic parameters in actual practice. However, the examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
In the present example various volume elements enter the furnace hot zone at different times. The lower regions near the leading edge which enter the furnace first represent the maximum time of residence whereas the volume elements at the top represent the zero time. The length axis thus represents the time axis. The capsule is 350 mm height and 75 mm O.D. and is closed at the bottom. It could be lowered into the furnace at linear speeds varying from 2-20 mm per minute. The mass was contained in a segmented stainless steel cage which is fitted into the capsule and is closed with the top cover. The cover which could be screwed on to the capsule was provided with outlets for hot gases as well as thermocouple wells at the center and near the periphery. The iron ore and non-coking coal having the analysis given below in Table 1 was used in the experiment. Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the furnace top. The gear assembly was then switched on to lower the capsule at the pre-determined speed. Once the capsule bottom reaches certain temperature volatile matter is evolved and was taken out through a trap. The increase in temperature was measured continuously. The movement was abruptly stopped when the capsule was totally inside the furnace i.e. the top of the capsule became level with the furnace top. The capsule was quickly withdrawn and quenched with nitrogen. The cage was removed when the capsule assembly had cooled to ambient temperature and samples were taken out from various locations for total iron analysis. This analysis represented the state of the system after a given residence time under the particular time-temperature programme was imposed on the sample. The residence time is easily obtained from the distance of the sample from the top, the total length of the capsule and its total travel time.<br>

Example 2<br>
In the present example various elements enters the furnace hot zone at different times. The lower regions near the leading edge which enter the furnace first represent the maximum time of residence whereas the volume elements at the top represent the zero time. The length axis thus represents the time axis. The capsule is 35 mm height and 75 mm O.D. and is closed at the bottom. It could be lowered into the furnace at linear speeds varying from 2-20 mm per minute. The mass was contained in a segmented stainless steel cage which is fitted into the capsule and is closed with the top cover. The cover which could be screwed on to the capsule was provided with outlets for hot gases as well as thermocouple wells at the center and near the periphery. The iron ore and non-coking coal having the analysis given below in table 1 was used in the experiment. Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the furnace top.<br>
The results of the extent of heat conduction along the bed of the reactants for two capsule speeds (6 mm/min and 8 mm/min) were obtained using one thermocouple placed centrally near the bottom of the capsule and one under 115 mm above it also placed centrally. Obviously the thermocouple placed higher up enters the furnace later. Therefore it shows a time lag in temperature pick up. It is interesting to note however that this time lag is nearly equal to that required by the trailing thermocouple to cover the distance separating it from the thermocouple leading it. The volume elements around the two thermocouple tips are under nearly identical time-temperature variations. It indicates there is only slight heat conduction along the bed. The volume elements are heated essentially by the radial heat fiux. Thus a single thermocouple placed centrally suffices to describe the temperature variation of all elements in the<br><br>
central region. As the course of the reaction in any region is determined by the way in which the temperature varies and thus must be available for any analysis of non-isothermic kinetic data. All samples are obtained for the same radial location as that of the temperature sensors.<br>

Example 3<br>
In the present example, the lower regions of the various volume elements contained in the capsule of 350 mm height and 75 mm O.D. and closed at the bottom entering the furnace hot zone near the leading edge which enter the furnace first represent the maximum time of residence whereas the volume elements at the top represent the zero time. The length axis thus represents the time axis. The mass was contained in a segmented stainless steel cage which is fitted into the capsule and is closed with the top cover. The cover which could be screwed on to the capsule was provided with outlets for hot gases as well as thermocouple wells at the center and near the periphery. The iron ore and non-coking coal having the analysis given below in Table 1 was used in the experiment. Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the furnace top. The gear assembly was then switched on to lower the capsule at the pre-determined speed, to study for a fixed particle size (-10+6 mm) the measured variation of total iron for three different ore-coal ratios (1:1, 1:0.8, 1:0.6) under the identical temperature variation (40°C - 1000°C), capsule speed 2 mm/min. and the maximum furnace<br>
temperature (1000°C ± 10°C). It is found that the data clearly demonstrate the effect of ore coal ratio on reducibility under identical conditions. Reduction is enhanced when the ore-coal ratio is decreased in the range study.<br>

Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the furnace top. The gear assembly was then switched on to lower the capsule at the pre-determined speed to study for additional particle sizes (-6+3 mm) under the identical temperature variation (40°C - 1000°C) for a given capsule speed 2 mm/min. and furnace temperature profile the rate of heating did not vary in the given range of particle size. However, there is enhanced reduction of ore with decreasing particle size of the ore and the coal.<br>

Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the furnace top. The gear assembly was then switched on to lower the capsule at the pre-determined speed for additional particle sizes (-3+1 mm) under the identical temperature variation (40*'C-<br>
1000°C±10°C) for a given capsule speed (2 mm/min.) and furnace temperature<br>
(1000°C) profile the rate of heating did not vary in the given range of particle size. However, there is enhanced reduction of ore with decreasing size of coal and ore and increasing proportion of coal.<br>

Example 6<br>
In the present example various elements enters the furnace hot zone at different times. The lower regions near the leading edge which enter the furnace first represent the<br>
maximum time of residence whereas the volume elements at the top represent the zero time. The length axis thus represents the time axis. The capsule is 350 mm height and 750 mm O.D. and is closed at the bottom. It could be lowered into the furnace at linear speeds varying from 2-20 mm per minute.

The cover which could be screwed on to the capsule was provided with outlets for hot gases as well as thermocouple wells at the center and near the periphery.

Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the fiimace top. The gear assembly was then switched on to lower the capsule at the pre-determined speed. To study the effect of particle size on reaction rate for a fixed temperature-time variation. For this iron ore-coal in the ratio of 1:0.8 were charged in the capsule for the particle size in the range of-3+1 mm under the identical time-temperature variation (40°C -1000°C) for a fixed capsule speed of 2mm per minute. The reduction reaction is facilitated as the particle size decreases. It was established by conducting experiments for other particle sizes in the range of-6+3 mm and -10+6 mm. The results show that the reduction reaction is facilitated as the particle size decreases due to the increase in the reaction interface area.<br>

Example 7<br>
In the present example various elements enters the fiimace hot zone at different times. The lower regions near the leading edge which enter the fiimace first represent the<br>
maximum time of residence whereas the volume elements at the top represent the zero time. The length axis thus represents the time axis. The capsule is 350 mm height and 75 mm O.D. and is closed at the bottom. It could be lowered into the ftimace at linear speeds varying from 2-20 mm per minute. The mass was contained in a segmented stainless steel cage which is fitted into the capsule and is closed with the top cover. The cover which could be screwed on to the capsule was provided with outlets for hot gases as well as thermocouple wells at the center and near the periphery. The iron ore and non-coking coal having the analysis given below in Table 1 was used in the experiment. Iron ore and coal after being crushed to the specific size of-10+6 mm in the ratio 1:0.8 was mixed thoroughly. The cage was fitted with the reaction mixture and the capsule was placed such that its bottom was level with the ftimace top. The gear assembly was then switched on to lower the capsule at the pre-determined speed.<br>
Reduction experiments using mixture of three different iron ores with single coal obtained from a standard reducibility apparatus in which ores are isothermally reduced at 1000±I0°C by a CO-N2 mixture (30:70) at 15 liters/ minute using a 500 gm sample of 10-12 mm ore. The resuUs show that the reactivity order of some of the ores is the reverse of that shown by the MBT data. A possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy the following: the MBT results are for a system where the reduction reactions are coupled with the gasification of carbon. There is no gasification reaction in the reducibility test and the kinetic data compared the reduction behaviour only. The gasification reaction influenced by the nature of the ore and the coal and the metallic iron produced from the ore which may well be different for the other two ores which show the discrepancy in their reactivity. The metallic iron produced in situ catalyses gasification of carbon dioxide.<br>

ADVANTAGES:<br>
1.	It helps carrying out non-isothermal kinetic studies under conditions of increasing temperatures.<br>
2.	Reactions take place simultaneously at many volume elements each of which eventually go through similar time temperature schedule. This situation is analogues to that prevalent in a reactor with continuous plug- flow of materials.<br>
3.	It can be usefully employed in general non-isothermal reducibility studies and thus is helpful in raw material characterization.<br>
4.	It would recreate some essential features of the composite situation of a continuous reactor.<br>
5.	The total sample after removal would represent frozen picture of the steady state situation.<br>
6.	A visual examination of the sample alone can yield a great deal of useful information such as melt down or fusion, the onset of other physical and chemical changes which leave visible clues etc.<br>
7.	It can be used to model horizontal or vertical reactors.<br>
8.	The degree of reaction obtainable under non-isothermal condition depends among other factors on the actual variation of temperature with time. It therefore controls and measures these variations which are of much importance in any real time reactors.<br>
9.	Unlike conventional thermal analysis studies it involves the heating of volume elements under actual temperature profile of the furnace simulating the material flow under the identical heat transfer coefficient and the thermo-physical property of the material on relatively large samples.<br>
10.	It also facilitates to simulate the reactions occurring at high temperatures under fluctuating conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
