				<td>COATED CUTTING TOOL, CUTTING MEMBER OR WEAR PART<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to providing protective coatings for general<br>
applications including cutting tools, cutting members and cutting tool bits, wear parts,<br>
thus extended working life.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For machining work-pieces, by cutting, turning, milling, drilling and like,<br>
cutting tools are used. The cutting tools remove surplus material, henceforth chips,<br>
thereby shaping the work-piece. However, they are, themselves, worn away in the<br>
process and require replacing. There is a correlation between hardness and wear<br>
resistance. To ensure that chips are efficiently removed from the work-piece, whilst<br>
ensuring long working life of the cutting tool, the cutting tool is required to be hard and<br>
tough.<br>
Hardness however may be correlated with brittleness however. Being both hard<br>
and tough, composite materials consisting of hard ceramic particles in a metal matrix<br>
are very popular choices for cutting tools. A number of such ceramic-metal composites<br>
or cermets have been developed. The so-called hard metals consisting of tungsten<br>
carbide particles in a metal matrix such as cobalt for example, are the materials of<br>
choice for fabrication of cutting members for many applications. The term "cutting<br>
member" includes, for example, inserts, cartridges, cutting plates, solid carbides cutting<br>
heads, drills and end mills, etc.<br>
The term "wear part" describes components used in applications where wear is a<br>
recognized problem. Wear parts may be for various wear applications such as, for<br>
example, machine parts, textile machine parts, ball bearings, roller bearings, moving<br>
parts in heat exchangers, turbo loaders, gas-turbine, exhaust valves, nozzles,<br>
manufacturing process dies for example for extrusion or wire drawing, punches,<br>
blanking tools, hot forging and pressing, molds, shear blades, plunger rods for pumps,<br>
plunger ball blanks, down hole pump check valve blanks, bushings, and other wear and<br>
impact applications.<br>
Wear parts are commonly made of carbon steel, austenitic, ferritic or<br>
martensitic stainless steels, hot work tool steels, cold work tool steels, 51000 steels,<br>
nickel and cobalt super alloys, and high speed steel.<br>
It will be appreciated that the wear of cutting members and wear parts takes<br>
place at their contact surfaces, and can be attributed to mechanical or friction type wear<br>
or abrasion. Abrasion of cutting tools is often enhanced by chemical attack, such as<br>
oxidization, for example, where the cutting tool material reacts with the surrounding<br>
air, and / or the work-piece and / or coolant fluids and lubricants in wet machining<br>
processes.<br>
The downtime of cutting tools whilst the cutting members are replaced and of<br>
other applications in which wear parts are replaced is costly. Much research is directed<br>
to improving the wear resistance of such cutting tools and wear parts by application of<br>
hard and / or chemical resistant coatings to increase their working life.<br>
Indentation hardness is a measure of resistance to plastic deformation. There is<br>
a strong correlation between indentation hardness and Mohs hardness, which indicates<br>
the relative resistance of materials to scratching. In general, the harder a material, the<br>
more abrasion resistant it is.<br>
Since hardness is a measure of resistance to plastic deformation, unfortunately,<br>
there is a general correlation between hardness and brittleness, and the harder a<br>
material is, the more brittle it is, i.e. the more likely it is that stresses will be relieved by<br>
crack propagation instead of by plastic deformation. In consequence of the above, it is<br>
generally found that the more resistant a material is to gradual abrasion, the more it is<br>
likely to be susceptible to brittle failure. It is often found that coatings that resist slow<br>
wear tend to be susceptible to catastrophic failure modes such as thermal shock,<br>
spalling, coating delamination and the like.<br>
The general thrust of materials science research and surface engineering for<br>
cutting tools and wear parts is to develop hard, tough (non-brittle) coatings that<br>
increase the working life of cutting tools and wear parts by providing protection on the<br>
surface against the main causes of wear: heat, chemical attack and abrasion.<br>
Coatings may be formed on cutting members and wear parts by a range of<br>
coating technologies that are generally classified as PVD (physical vapor deposition) or<br>
CVD (chemical vapor deposition).<br>
PVD gives very good properties and coating deposition rates are generally<br>
equivalent than those of CVD techniques. It is a feature of PVD processes that<br>
coatings can only be applied to line-of-sight areas of a substrate and cannot be applied<br>
in holes and on shielded surfaces. Residual stresses from coating deposition tend to be<br>
compressive and these stresses may cau333333se coatings to flake off. Because of<br>
both the low deposition rates and the risk of coating failure due to the tensile internal<br>
stresses and residual stresses from the deposition process as the coating thickness<br>
increases, PVD is generally limited to thin coatings.<br>
In contrast, CVD coatings are not restricted to line-of-sight deposition.<br>
Relatively thick coatings of several microns may be deposited and, since residual<br>
stresses may be tensile or compressive depending upon the substrate, the coatings are<br>
less susceptible to spalling. Furthermore, deposition temperatures are typically rather<br>
higher than those of PVD technologies. This facilitates the development of a diffusion-<br>
induced interface between the coating and substrate which allows good adhesion to be<br>
achieved. Indeed, good adhesion is one of the critical requirements for the coatings<br>
applied to cutting members and wear parts and for more than 40 years, CVD (chemical<br>
vapor deposition) has been used for coating cutting tools, cutting members, and wear<br>
parts thereby improving their performance and effective working life.<br>
It will be appreciated that some coatings and coating - substrate combinations<br>
favor themselves to one or other deposition process and there are host of materials for<br>
which only one or other process route is practicable.<br>
Coatings of TiN, TiC and Ti(C,N) maybe deposited onto appropriate substrates<br>
by reacting titanium tetrachloride with other gases, and removing the gaseous chlorides<br>
thus formed:<br>
TiCl4 + N2 + H2 ? TiN + Chlorides and other gases .<br>
TiCl4 + CH4+ H2 ? TiC + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
TiCl4 + N2+CH4 + H2 ? Ti(C,N) + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
It will be appreciated that, over the years, other chemical vapor deposition<br>
routes have become available for deposition of TiN, TiC and Ti(C,N), and the titanium<br>
chloride processes described above are given by way of non-limiting example, only.<br>
For example, MT (medium temperature) processing routes which tend to<br>
produce different microstructures, often having columnar grain structure are popular.<br>
For example:<br>
CH3CN + N2 + H2 + TiCl4 ? MT Ti(C,N) + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, a scanning electron micrograph of the face of a typical<br>
MT-Ti(C,N) coating as deposited by CVD is shown. The coating typically presents a<br>
fine grained (1-3 micron) grain size on its face.<br>
As the processing temperature increases, the substrate expands. On cooling, the<br>
substrate and coating contract and, if the contraction is at different rates, residual<br>
stresses result. It will be noted that the crack to the right of the micrograph is a typical<br>
consequence of thermal mismatch between the coating and the substrate. By lowering<br>
the process temperature, such cracking can be minimized. Where substrates contract<br>
more than coating on cooling, such cracks tend to be closed.<br>
Examination of a section through such a coating shows that the microstructure<br>
consists of elongated crystals aligned through the coating thickness. This is due to the<br>
growth of seeded crystals aligned such that the preferred direction of growth lies<br>
through the coating thickness. Such coatings may be as much as 30 microns thick.<br>
Cemented carbide made primarily of tungsten carbide optionally with the<br>
addition of other carbides in a primarily cobalt binder is by far the most popular<br>
substrate used for cutting tools. To prevent the cobalt binder reacting with the CVD<br>
gases used for depositing a wear resistant coating such as TiCN, a thin (0.1 µm to 1.5<br>
µm) protective layer of TiN is generally deposited prior to the TiCN layer. The<br>
protective layer of TiN allows the tool bit to be subjected to the relatively harsh CVD<br>
conditions required for deposition of TiCN without decarburizing the substrate thereof,<br>
thereby minimizing the formation of undesirable, brittle ? phases (M12C, M6C where M<br>
is Co and W) being formed near surface of the substrate 12. EP 0 440 157 and EP 0 643<br>
152 describe deposition of TiN under TiCN in this manner.<br>
TiCN is preferred to TiN in many cutting tool applications since TiCN has<br>
better wear resistance and a lower coefficient of friction than TiN. Indeed, machining<br>
with a TiN surfaced cutting tool may result in very high temperatures being generated<br>
at which the coating may oxidize.<br>
In the machining of hard materials, such as cast iron, for example, high<br>
temperatures are generated and even TiCN, and TiC may interact with the work-piece<br>
and / or with the cooling fluids and air.<br>
One way of limiting workpiece - coating reactions is by alloying the coatings<br>
with silicon which tends to form dense oxides. Alloying with chromium or vanadium<br>
increases toughness and thus tool life when machining certain applications.<br>
United States Patent Number US 6,007,909 to Rolander et al., entitled "CVD-<br>
Coated Titanium Based Carbonitride Cutting Tool Insert" relates to a cutting tool insert<br>
of a carbonitride alloy with titanium as the main component but also containing<br>
tungsten and cobalt. The cutting tool insert is useful for machining, specifically for the<br>
milling and drilling of metal and alloys. The insert is provided with a coating of at<br>
least one wear resistant layer. The composition of the insert and the coating is chosen<br>
in such a way that a crack-free coating in a moderate (up to 1000 MPa) compressive<br>
residual stress state is obtained. It is alleged that the absence of cooling cracks in the<br>
coating, such as that shown to the right of Fig. 2 and described hereinabove, in<br>
combination with the moderate compressive stress, gives the tool insert improved<br>
properties compared to prior art tools in many cutting tool applications. The alloying<br>
of the coatings with Ti, Al, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Mo, W, Si or B to give solid<br>
solutions is discussed. The coatings are characterized as being free from cooling<br>
cracks, having a thickness exceeding 1 um and a compressive residual stress at room<br>
temperature of 100-800 MPa. It will, however, be appreciated that using titanium<br>
based carbonitride as the substrate for machine tool inserts is a serious limitation. For<br>
regular cutting tools, WC-Co is the material of choice. Furthermore, although V, Cr<br>
and Si are suggested as possible alloying elements for addition to coating layers during<br>
CVD deposition, there is no further discussion of such coatings, and it does not appear<br>
that they were ever produced.<br>
There is thus still a need for improved Ti based hard metal coatings and the<br>
present invention addresses this need.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coating optimization is a multifaceted and unpredictable issue. Although there<br>
have been breakthroughs in surface engineering the effect of different process<br>
parameters on the microstructure of coatings is not fully understood. Additionally, the<br>
complex interrelationships between the features of a coating's microstructure and its<br>
tribology are not properly comprehended.<br>
The present invention is directed to cutting members, such as cutting tool inserts<br>
and the like, having novel coatings including at least one layer based on TiN, TiC or<br>
Ti(C,N) but modified by the inclusion of appreciable amounts of alloying metals such<br>
as one or more of chromium, vanadium and silicon. The novel coating layers thus<br>
formed have the general formula (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz where x + y + z = 1 and<br>
display similar properties to TiN, TiC and Ti(C,N), i.e. are hard and tough, but, due to<br>
the alloying metals, typically have improved corrosion resistance and are thus less<br>
likely to react with the work-piece, cooling fluid or surrounding air.<br>
The alloying elements may exist in solid solution and/or may be deposited as<br>
secondary phase within TiC, TiN or Ti(C,N) grains or along grain boundaries<br>
therebetween. Not only is the location of the dopant and the microstructural phases not<br>
fully understood. The relative partial pressures of titanium containing and alloy<br>
containing vapors in the reaction chamber during the CVD processes are known.<br>
It is hypothesized that, as with simpler, better understood systems such as steels,<br>
metallic dopants or alloying elements within the crystal lattice of the host coating<br>
material, whether incorporated substitutionally or interstitially, tend to strain the lattice<br>
and retard slip mechanisms. Similarly, inclusions rich in the alloying element, whether<br>
deposited along grain boundaries or included within grains, will interfere with slip and<br>
have a hardening effect. Inclusions also retard crack propagation, deflecting cracks and<br>
thus tend to have a toughening effect. Consequently the alloyed coatings of the<br>
invention are typically harder and / or tougher depending upon alloying type than<br>
regular TiN, TiC and Ti(C,N) coatings of the prior art.<br>
Whether or not the above hypothesis is true, experimental alloyed coatings with<br>
varying amounts of alloying elements were compared with non-alloyed TiN, TiC and<br>
Ti(C,N) coatings in various machining tests, under a variety of cutting tests on a variety<br>
of substrates. The positive effects of depositing coatings of TiN, TiC and Ti(C,N)<br>
alloyed with silicon, vanadium and chromium has been demonstrated.<br>
The alloyed coating layers are deposited by chemical vapor deposition CVD,<br>
and may be up to 20 µm thick. This is significantly thicker than coatings practically<br>
achievable by PVD type technologies. Additionally, since the coating deposition is<br>
initiated by a chemical reaction occurring on the substrate (or underlying coating)<br>
surface, a strong chemical bond is formed, and the coating - substrate adhesion is<br>
typically higher than that achievable by PVD.<br>
One route for depositing TiN, TiC and Ti(C,N)respectively is by reacting the<br>
titanium chloride with appropriate gases as follows:<br>
TiCl4+N2+H2 ? TiN + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
TiCl4+CH4+H2 ? TiC + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
TiCl4+N2+CH4+H2 ? TiCN+ Chlorides and other gases.<br>
There are also MT (medium temperature) processing routes which tend to<br>
produce different microstructures, often having finer grain size, are popular. For<br>
example medium temperature Ti(C,N) may be fabricated as follows:<br>
CH3CN + N2 + H2 + TiCL, - MT Ti(C,N) + Chlorides and other gases.<br>
Typically the deposition temperature is between about 720 - 950°C often called<br>
medium temperature or 'MT' and 950 - 1100°C for high temperature 'HT' coatings.<br>
It will be appreciated however, that, in addition to starting with titanium halide,<br>
other reactions routes are possible and will suggest themselves to persons of the art.<br>
In the fabrication of coatings of the type (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz appreciable<br>
amounts of the nitrides and carbides of chromium, vanadium and / or silicon are co-<br>
deposited with TiN, TiCN and / or Ti(C,N). One way in which this co-deposition may<br>
be achieved is by the controlled addition of the halides of chromium, vanadium and<br>
silicon to the reaction chamber. Typically the chlorides of chromium, vanadium and<br>
silicon are added. Control of the partial pressures of the reactants and the reaction<br>
temperature provide a viable mechanism for affecting the composition and<br>
microstructure of the coatings thus formed.<br>
Using moderate fabrication temperatures of around 900°C or less lowers the<br>
stresses between the coating and substrate and minimizes cooling cracking phenomena.<br>
In general, the higher the deposition temperature, the more crystal growth is favored<br>
over seeding of new crystals, and coarser, columnar coatings result.<br>
For optimizing cutting tools and cutting tool bits for specific applications, the<br>
coating layer of (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz may be combined with other coatings. For<br>
example, as explained hereinabove, TiN is not, itself, generally used as a wear resistant<br>
coating for machining tool bits, however it is often advantageous to deposit a thin (0.1<br>
µm to 1.5 µm) protective layer of TiN prior to deposition of<br>
(Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)Cx, (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CyNz or (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz since the<br>
relatively harsh CVD conditions required for the deposition of the<br>
(Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)Cx, (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CyNz or (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz could<br>
otherwise decarburize the substrate leading to the formation of undesirable, brittle r]<br>
phases (M12C, MeC where M is Co and W) being formed near surface of the substrate<br>
which could lead to catastrophic failure by the coating flaking off, for example.<br>
Although Ti(C,N) is particularly good at resisting flank and nose wear of<br>
cutting tool inserts, Al2O3 has been demonstrated as being generally more desirable on<br>
the rake face. The coating layer of (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz may advantageously be<br>
covered with a subsequent layer of alumina, for example; each coating layer providing<br>
effective protection against different types of wear.<br>
With reference now to Fig. 3 a schematic illustrative section of a cutting tool or<br>
cutting tool bit 10 is shown. Cutting tool bit 10 comprises a substrate 12 onto which<br>
various intermediate layers 14,16,18 are deposited, and an alloyed coating layer 20 of<br>
general formula (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz deposited thereon. Subsequent layers 22,<br>
24 may then be deposited onto the alloyed coating layer 20.<br>
The substrate 12 may be fabricated from a high speed steel alloy containing, in<br>
addition to iron and carbon, varying amounts of refractory metals such as chromium,<br>
tungsten, molybdenum and titanium, for example. Substrate 12 may include a super-<br>
hard material such as BN or diamond. Alternatively, substrate 12 may include a<br>
ceramic such as SisN4, Al2O3, Al2O3/TiC, SiAlON, Al2O3/SiC whisker composite, and<br>
the like. More commonly, substrate 12 is a cermet type composite such as TiC or TiN<br>
in a metallic binder. Most typically, however, substrate 12 is a hard metal cemented<br>
carbide type composite material, such as WC-Co or Cr3C2-NiCr that is generally<br>
fabricated by sintering. Indeed, tungsten carbide (WC) cemented by a metal matrix,<br>
usually Cobalt (Co) is the most popular choice for cutting tool bits.<br>
Alloyed coating layer 20 has general formula (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz and<br>
typically between 50% and 99% of the metal within the coating is titanium. However,<br>
a substantial amount, normally at least 0.1% and preferably at least 5%, of alloying<br>
metal, such as Cr, V and /or Si is included within the alloyed coating layer 20.<br>
Generally alloyed coating layer 20 includes between 0.1% and 30% of at least one<br>
alloying metal selected from the list of chromium, vanadium and silicon. Alloyed<br>
coating layer may include two or indeed all three of chromium, vanadium and silicon in<br>
varying proportions. Typically no more than between 30% and most typically no more<br>
than 10% (atomic percentages) of the total metal content is any one of the alloying<br>
species.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2, a method of fabricating cutting tool bits in accordance<br>
with the present invention is now described. Firstly, a substrate fabricated from a<br>
selected material and having appropriate geometry is obtained (Step 202). The<br>
substrate is prepared by a process including at least one of degreasing, sandblasting and<br>
washing. For example, the substrate may be cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of ethanol<br>
and then sandblasted with #400 alumina grit, thereby ensuring an active surface that is<br>
free from oxide scale, dirt and the like, for deposition of coatings thereupon (Step 204).<br>
The substrate is placed into a chemical vapor deposition reaction chamber (Step 206).<br>
Optionally, previous coating layers may be deposited, such as TiN for example (Step<br>
208). An alloyed coating layer of (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz is then deposited by<br>
chemical vapor deposition (Step 210). This may perhaps be accomplished by reacting<br>
a mixture of titanium chloride or other halide with halides of alloying metals, such as<br>
chromium halide (typically chromium chloride), vanadium halide (typically vanadium<br>
chloride) and silicon halide (typically silicon chloride) and gases such as nitrogen,<br>
hydrogen and methane, for example.<br>
Subsequent coating layers such as, for example, alpha, kappa or gamma<br>
alumina, TiN, TiC, Ti(C,N), TiAlCN, TiAlCON, and or other (Ti100-a-b-<br>
cCraVbSic)CxNyOz compositions may then be deposited thereupon (Step 212), with the<br>
optimal coating lay up being dependent on specific tooling requirements.<br>
Control of both the composition and the microstructure of alloyed coating layer<br>
20 may be achieved by selecting reaction temperature and appropriate partial pressures<br>
of the reaction gases during the chemical vapor deposition process. In general: (i) the<br>
ratio of partial pressure of titanium halide to halide of alloying metal and (ii) the<br>
fabrication temperature control the composition of the coating thus formed. In typical<br>
deposition processes of the invention, the partial pressure of titanium chloride is<br>
significantly more than the partial pressure of chromium, vanadium or silicon halide,<br>
and the ratio of titanium chloride to other halides in the coating is usually between 1:1<br>
and 99:1.<br>
The general reaction leading to the coating layer of the invention is as follows:<br>
TiCl4+N2 + (SiCl4, VCl3, CrCl2)+ H2 ? (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)Ny+ Chlorides and other<br>
gases.<br>
TiCl4,+N2 + CH4 + (SiCl4, VCl3, CrCl2) + H2 ? (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNy+ Chlorides<br>
and other gases.<br>
TiCl4+ CH4 + (SiCl4, VCl3, CrCl2) + H2 - (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)Cx + Chlorides and other<br>
gases.<br>
TiCl4+ CH4 + (SiCl4, VCl3, CrCl2)+ N2 + CO2 + H2 ? (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz +<br>
Chlorides and other gases.<br>
TiCl4+ CH3CN + (SiCl4, VCl3, CrCl2)+ N2 + CO2 ? (Ti100-a-b-cCraVbSic)CxNyOz +<br>
Chlorides and other gases.<br>
For each desired alloying element, the partial pressure of the halide is typically<br>
0.1% to 30% of the total metal halide partial pressure. Alloyed coating layer 20 will<br>
typically be deposited at a temperature in the range of from about 720°C for (MT type<br>
coatings) to 1100°C or so (for HT type coatings). The amounts of each metallic species<br>
in the reactive atmosphere, i.e. the partial pressures of the reactant gases in the CVD<br>
deposition chamber, are not the same as the relative percentages of the metals in the<br>
coating. Nevertheless, control of the partial pressures during deposition does provide a<br>
means of controlling the composition of the resulting coatings.<br>
Proof of Concept Examples<br>
To demonstrate proof of concept, thereby reducing the invention to practice, a<br>
series of coatings was deposited onto a CNMG 432 GN cutting member, as widely used<br>
for turning processes. The coated cutting members thus formed were used to machine a<br>
range of materials in different manners under a range of conditions.<br>
Example 1: Si alloying<br>
After first depositing a protective layer of TiN to protect the substrate from the<br>
harsh reactive gases, thereby preventing decarburization of the substrate surface, three<br>
samples of Ti(CN) were deposited onto CNMG432GN hard metal substrates, to<br>
provide coated cutting tools as described in table 1. The first coating was not alloyed.<br>
During fabrication of the second coating, the partial pressure of Silicon chloride was<br>
such that 5% of the metal ions in the reactive mixture were silicon. In the third coating,<br>
10% of the metal content of the reactive gases was silicon.<br>
<br>
Table 1 - compositions and thicknesses of coatings deposited onto CNMG 432 GN hard<br>
metal substrates.<br>
For quality control and optimization purposes, a Vickers diamond was indented<br>
onto the coated face of the coated substrate, at an applied load of 20 Kg. The resultant<br>
indents were examined under an optical microscope for signs of cracking and<br>
delamination in and around the indent footprint. Where clear indents without cracking<br>
resulted, the coatings were considered as being well bonded to the substrate.<br>
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 are SEM photomicrographs showing the surface and section of<br>
coating number 3 of table 1.<br>
The coated cutting tool inserts having coating layers as tabulated in table 1,<br>
were directly compared with each other by being used to machine SAE 1045 steel and<br>
gray Cast iron GG 25 under identical conditions.<br>
For the continuous turning of steel SAE 1045, the cutting speed (Vc) was set to<br>
250 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to 0.20 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was set to<br>
2 mm. No coolant was used, and the cutting was performed dry, i.e. without using a<br>
lubricant. The experimentally determined tool lives for Coating Nos. 1, 2 and 3 were<br>
22, 30 and 30 minutes respectively.<br>
For the continuous turning of gray Cast iron GG 25, the cutting speed (Vc) was<br>
100 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to 0.2 mm/rev, the depth of cut (ap) was 2 mm, and<br>
the cutting was performed dry, without cooling fluids or lubricant. This time, the tool<br>
lives for coatings 1, 2 and 3 were 4.5 minutes, 7 minutes and 3.5 minutes respectively.<br>
These results are summarized in Table 2.<br>
<br>
Table 2. Comparing empirically determined cutting tool lives for identical cutting tool<br>
inserts, coated with Ti(C,N) coatings that included varying amounts of silicon.<br>
It will be appreciated that by comparing the behavior of different coatings under<br>
identical and realistic machining conditions in this manner, process parameters can be<br>
varied one-factor-at-a-time and their influence on the performance of cutting tools<br>
including such coatings can be accurately empirically assessed.<br>
The worn cutting tool edges were examined in an attempt to quantify the types<br>
of wear occurring. It appears that the main advantage of using Ti(C,N) coatings<br>
alloyed with Silicon for machining SAE 1045 steel is that crater type wear is<br>
significantly reduced. The effect is demonstrated by comparing Fig. 7a where the worn<br>
surface MT-TiCN with 0% silicon is shown, to Fig. 7b showing the worn surface of the<br>
MT-TiCN coating including a relatively large amount of silicon, i.e. when reactive<br>
atmosphere during the deposition included 10% silicon. It will be appreciated that both<br>
coatings were subjected to identical machining conditions for identical periods of time.<br>
Example 2 - Medium and High Temperature (Ti-Si)C,N Coatings<br>
A second comparative test was performed, wherein the performance of the<br>
cutting tool bit coated with (Ti-Si)C,N deposited by medium temperature chemical<br>
vapor deposition (sample 3 hereinabove) was compared with a cutting tool bit coated<br>
with a multilayer coating having a thin (Ti-Si)C,N medium temperature CVD layer<br>
covered with an alumina coating and coated with a TiCN or (Ti-Si)C,N high<br>
temperature CVD layer (sample 4). 10% of the metal in the reactive atmosphere during<br>
the CVD deposition was silicon, the rest was titanium.<br>
A conventional TiCN coated cutting tool (sample 1) without silicon alloying<br>
was used as a control. In the fabrication of all three of these cutting member samples, a<br>
thin TiN barrier layer was first deposited onto the CNMG 432 GN substrate. The<br>
thicknesses of the various layers are summarized in Table 3.<br>
<br>
Table 3 - summarizing coating structure for three samples with varying alloyed silicon<br>
contents and fabricated at medium and high temperatures<br>
For the continuous turning of steel SAE 1045, the cutting speed (Vc) was set to<br>
320 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to 0.20 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was set to<br>
2 mm. No coolant was used, and the cutting was performed dry, i.e. without using a<br>
lubricant. The effective tool lives for Coating Nos. 1, 3 and 4 were 7, 9 and 11.5<br>
minutes respectively.<br>
A comparative, empirical, interrupted machining test was performed on a<br>
SAE 1060 steel work-piece. The cutting speed (Vc) was 93 m/min, the feed rate (f)<br>
was set to 80 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was 3 mm. Once again, the cutting was<br>
performed dry, without lubricant or cooling fluid. This time, the tool lives for coatings<br>
1, 3 and 4 were 7.5 passes, 6.5 passes and 16 passes respectively.<br>
An interrupted chipping test was also performed on a SAE 4340 steel<br>
work-piece. The cutting speed (Vc) was 210 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to<br>
0.5 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was 2 mm. this time, however, wet machining was<br>
used. The tool lives, defined as the length of the machined part to the exceeded cutting<br>
edge wear, for coatings 1, 3 and 4 were 102 cm, 102 cm and 204 cm respectively.<br>
The results of the comparative wear tests are summarized in Fig. 8 which are<br>
normalized, i.e. showing the results of the 3 tests as percentage performance of coatings<br>
3 and coating 4 compared with the performance of coating 1 (Ti-0% Si) C,N. The<br>
results demonstrate effective working lives for identical cutting tool inserts coated with<br>
Ti(C,N) coatings that included varying amounts of silicon due to the relative partial<br>
pressures of 0-10% silicon in the reactant vapor.<br>
The tests performed were:<br>
Test A: continuous SAE 1045 - 320 dry / test 2;<br>
Test B: strength, Walter test SAE 1060 - 93 dry / test 4; and<br>
Test C: chipping test SA 4340 - 210 wet.<br>
Although it will be appreciated that multilayer coatings must be considered as<br>
systems, and the effect of the penultimate layer of alumina is expected to contribute to<br>
the overall behavior of the coated tool bit, it can nevertheless be concluded that the (Ti-<br>
Si)C,N coating deposited at high temperature enables a significantly improved cutting<br>
tool performance with the work-piece, particularly for interrupted machining.<br>
<br>

under empirical wear simulations<br>
Example 3: Chromium alloying<br>
Coatings of titanium alloyed with chromium MT- (Ti-Cr) C,N were deposited<br>
onto hard metal substrates; specifically onto CNMG 432 GN cutting tool inserts as used<br>
for turning. In coating 1, no chromium was present in the reactive atmosphere, but in<br>
coatings 5 and 6, 10% of the metal in the reactive atmosphere during the CVD<br>
deposition was chromium Table 5 summarizes the coating structures formed.<br>
<br>
Table 5 - layer types and thicknesses for medium temperature and high temperature<br>
chromium alloyed coatings<br>
It is noted that coatings 5 and 6 had intermediate layer of medium temperature<br>
TiCN deposited under the alloyed (titanium-chromium) carbide layer. In coating 5, the<br>
upper layer was deposited at moderate temperature of approx. 900°C, whereas in<br>
coating 6, the outer coating was deposited at a relatively high temperature of 1000°C.<br>
Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 are SEM photomicrographs showing the surface and section<br>
of coating 5, showing the double layer of MT- Ti(C,N) followed by MT-(Ti-Si)C,N.<br>
As with the Ti(C,N) alloyed with silicon discussed above, the cutting tools with<br>
coated alloyed with Chromium were used to machine work-pieces under various<br>
conditions providing direct comparisons between the performance of the different<br>
coatings under different machining conditions as follows:<br>
Test 1: Continuous (wet) turning of SAE 316 L<br>
For the continuous turning of steel SAE 316 L, the cutting speed (Vc) was set to<br>
300 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to 0.20 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was set to<br>
2 mm. This time a coolant was used. The performance of both (Ti-Cr)CN and (Ti-Cr)C<br>
coated substrates (coatings 5 and 6) were 12 minutes and 14 minutes respectively, i.e.<br>
20% and 40% better than the performance of TiCN without chromium, which lasted<br>
only 10 minutes. Both these coatings were deposited from a mixture of reactive gases<br>
including 105 Cr (percentage of metal in atmosphere by partial pressure).<br>
Test 2: Interrupted dry machining test of steel SAE 1060<br>
For the turning of steel SAE 1060, the cutting speed (Vc) was set to 93 m/min,<br>
the feed rate (f) was set to 80 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was set to 3 mm. No<br>
coolant was used. The performance of both (Ti-Cr)CN and (Ti-Cr)C were 17.5 passes<br>
and 23 passes respectively, i.e. 233% and 307% better than the performance of TiCN<br>
which survived only 7 1/2 passes.<br>
<br>
Table 6 - showing the effect on wear on the addition of chromium to Ti based coatings.<br>
A further series of coatings were deposited to determine the effects of alloying TiC and<br>
TiCN with varying amounts of chromium and the effect of process temperature. The<br>
thickness and materials of the coating layers are summarized in Table 7.<br>
<br>
Table 7 summarizing the thickness and materials of the coating layers of TiC and TiCN<br>
alloyed with chromium.<br>
The coated cutting tool inserts were used to wet machine SAE 4340 steel in an<br>
interrupted fashion resulting in chipping type wear.<br>
Fig. 11 is a bar chart showing comparative wear resistances of Ti(C,N) coatings<br>
1 and coatings 5 and 6 alloyed by the co-deposition and inclusion of chromium from a<br>
reactive gas mixture including 10% chromium by metal content. The cutting speed<br>
(Vc) was set to 210 m/rnin, the feed rate (f) was set to 0.15 mm/rev and the depth of cut<br>
(ap) was set to 2 mm. the machining was performed using a coolant. The tool life was<br>
defined as the length of the machined part to the exceeded cutting edge wear, and,<br>
using this definition, the Ti(C,N) coating (coating 1) had a tool life of 1.36 cm. Merely<br>
fabricating the Ti(C,N) coating at a higher deposition temperature (coating 7) increased<br>
the tool life to 1.53 cm which is a 12.5% increase, despite the overall coating thickness<br>
being 10% thinner.<br>
The tests performed were<br>
Test A: continuous SAE 316 L - 300 - wet; and<br>
Test B: strength, Walter test SAE 1060 - 93 dry.<br>
Alloying with less and more chromium (partial pressures of reactive gases - 5%<br>
Cr and 10% Cr respectively) increased the tool life to 1.7 cm, i.e. a 25% increase,<br>
despite the overall coating thickness being less, see Fig. 12 which shows comparative<br>
wear resistances (e.g. empirically determined effective working lives) of MT Ti(C,N),<br>
HT Ti(C,N), HT (Ti-Cr)C,N with less chromium, i.e. 5% partial pressure of chromium<br>
in the chemical vapor of the reactive gas, and HT (Ti-Cr)C,N coatings with more<br>
chromium, i.e. 10% partial pressure of Chromium containing gas in the reactive<br>
mixture. The coating Nos. 7, 8, and 9 were compared to coating No. 1 and the test C<br>
performed was and interupted chipping test SA 4340 - 210 wet test.<br>
Example 4: Vanadium alloying<br>
Once again, coatings were deposited onto WC-Co cutting tool substrates.<br>
CNMG 432 GN hard metal substrate for turning was again used for all the experiments.<br>
Table 8 showing coating dimensions and compositions for vanadium alloyed coatings.<br>
With reference to Fig. 13, a SEM micrograph of a cross section through sample<br>
11 is given. Note the moderate temperature coating Ti(C,N) coating (layer A) which<br>
has a columnar microstructure, followed by a second coating (layer B) containing<br>
significant, if indeterminate amounts of vanadium and having an equiaxed crystalline<br>
structure.<br>
Test 1: Continuous (wet) turning of SAE 1045<br>
A workpiece of Steel SAE 1045 was machined under continuous turning<br>
conditions by a Ti(C,N) coated cutting tool (coating No. 1) and by similar cutting tools<br>
coated with similar coatings but alloyed by the co deposition and inclusion of vanadium<br>
from a reactive gas mixture including 5% (coating no. 10) and 10% (coating no. 11) of<br>
vanadium by metal content.<br>
Fig. 15 is a bar chart showing the comparative wear resistances of the three<br>
coatings. The cutting speed (Vc) was set to 250 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to<br>
0.2 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was set to 2 mm. No coolant was used. The tool<br>
life was given in time to failure, and using this definition, the Ti(C,N) coating (coating<br>
1) had a tool life of 18 minutes. Coating 10 with a low vanadium content had a tool life<br>
of 20 minutes and coating 11 with a higher vanadium content, had a life of 19 minutes.<br>
It appears therefore, that alloying with vanadium increases the life of cutting tools<br>
under these machining conditions. The tests performed were<br>
Test A: continuous SAE 1045 - 250 m dry / test 2;<br>
Test B: strength, Walter test SAE 1060 - 93 dry / tests 4 and 5; and<br>
Test C: chipping test SA 4340 - 210 wet.<br>
The coatings were examined after 8 minutes of continuous turning. Fig. 14a is<br>
an optical microphotograph showing the worn surface of a MT TiCN coated cutting<br>
tool (sample 1) and Fig. 14b is an optical microphotograph showing the worn surface of<br>
the MT (Ti-V)CN coating that included a relatively large amount of vanadium, i.e.<br>
when the reactive atmosphere during the deposition included 10% chromium halide<br>
vapors by weight (sample 11). It will be appreciated that both coatings were subjected<br>
to identical machining conditions for identical periods of time. Nevertheless, the crater<br>
wear is significantly reduced with the vanadium alloyed coating indicating that<br>
Vanadium alloying of MT TiCN reduces crater wear.<br>
Test 2: Interrupted dry machining test of steel SAE 1060<br>
For the turning of steel SAE 1060, the cutting speed (Vc) was set to 93 m/min,<br>
the feed rate (f) was set to 80 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was set to 3 mm. No<br>
coolant was used. Coating 1 (TiCN) had a working life of 6 passes. Coating 10 had a<br>
working life of 11 passes and coating 11 had a working life of 18 passes. Clearly the<br>
alloying with vanadium provides significant benefits in interrupted machining of this<br>
type.<br>
An interrupted chipping test was also performed on a SAE 4340 steel<br>
work-piece. The cutting speed (Vc) was 210 m/min, the feed rate (f) was set to<br>
0.15 mm/rev and the depth of cut (ap) was 2 mm. This time, however, wet machining<br>
was used. The tool lives, defined as the length of the machined part to the exceeded<br>
cutting edge wear, for coatings 1, 10 and 11 were 102 cm, 85 cm and 90 cm<br>
respectively. It appears, therefore, that for interrupted chipping, the vanadium alloying<br>
was not advantageous.<br>
The results of the comparative wear tests are summarized in Fig. 15 which are<br>
normalized, i.e. showing the results of the 3 tests as percentage performance compared<br>
with the performance of coating 1.<br>
Examples of Substrate Coating Combinations for Wear Parts<br>
The following examples utilize the coatings and methods of coating disclosed<br>
above upon different substrates by way of example that are intended for use as wear<br>
parts.<br>
Example 5: Carbon steel base low alloyed substrate coating combination<br>
A coating for a carbon steel base low alloyed substrate, for example AISI<br>
51100, comprising a first layer of HT-TiVCrN or MT-TiVCrN. One or more layers of<br>
any of coatings 2-11 described above may be deposited upon the first layer. These<br>
coatings are corrosion resistant and significantly reduce decarburization. The improved<br>
temperature shock resistance of this coating allows the coating and hardening oil<br>
hardening and or vacuum high pressure quenching steels. These coatings are excellent<br>
for applications such as, for example, ball bearings, roller bearings, type 51000 steels,<br>
or textile machine parts.<br>
Example 6: Hot work tool steel substrate coating combination<br>
Example 6A A coating for a hot work tool steel substrate, for example AISI<br>
HI 3 with a first layer of HT-TiCN. One or more layers of any of coatings 2-11<br>
described above may be deposited upon the first layer, particularly TiVCN coatings.<br>
These coatings are excellent for applications such as, for example, extrusion and wire<br>
drawing AlCu alloys, and steels.<br>
Example 6B A coating for a hot work tool steel substrate, for example AISI<br>
H13 with a first layer of HT-TiVCRN or MT-TiVCRN and a second layer of MT-<br>
TiCN. One or more layers of any of coatings 2-11 described above may be deposited<br>
upon the second layer. A top layer of CrTiSi(C,N) in combination with a columnar<br>
MT-Cr layer is excellent for tougher tools with improved heat checking resistance, and<br>
shock resistance especially for applications such as hot forging and pressing.<br>
Example 7: Stainless steel, Nickel and Cobalt super alloys substrate coating<br>
combination<br>
A coating for austenitic, ferritic and martensitic stainless steels, for example<br>
A1S1316 or A1S1420, nickel and cobalt super alloys with a first layer of HT-TiVCrN or<br>
MT-TiVCrN followed by a second layer of MT-TiCN. One or more layers of any of<br>
coatings 2-11 described above may be deposited upon the second layer. These<br>
coatings are excellent for substrates for which alumina, especially thick layers of<br>
alumina, is difficult to apply. A layer of HT-Ti-Cr-Si-N significantly improves<br>
resistant to adhesive wear, high temperature wear, and oxidation. These coatings are<br>
excellent for applications such as, for example, moving parts in heat exchangers<br>
(fretting), turbo loader, gas-turbine applications.<br>
Example 8: Cold work tool steels or High speed steel substrate coating combination<br>
A coating for cold work tool steels, for example AISID2 and for high speed<br>
steel, for example AISI M2 with a single layer of TiVCN. These coatings are excellent<br>
for applications such as, for example, cold forming of stainless steel. One or more<br>
layers of any of coatings 2-11 described above may be deposited upon the first layer.<br>
Although it will be appreciated that multilayer coatings must be considered as<br>
systems, and the effect of the penultimate layer of (Ti-0%V)C,N is expected to<br>
contribute to the overall behavior of the coated tool bits, it can nevertheless be<br>
concluded that alloying with vanadium significantly improved cutting tool<br>
performance, particularly for interrupted machining.<br>
The effect of the vanadium alloying of MT-TiCN is to change the coating grain<br>
structure to a less columnar grain structure. The biggest gains appeared to be a<br>
reduction of crater wear in continuous turning of Carbon Steel and an increase in<br>
coating and cutting edge strength.<br>
Alloying with two or more metals selected from the list of silicon, chromium<br>
and vanadium and perhaps even more exotic materials such as molybdenum are<br>
expected to show similar properties. The effect is not expected to be additive, but, as<br>
with the long researched and far better understood alloyed iron-carbon system (steels),<br>
appropriate amounts of different alloying elements are expected to provide<br>
improvements in the properties such as hardness, corrosion resistance, etc., giving a<br>
longer working life to the cutting tools thus coated.<br>
Generally, for reasons discussed above, alloying TiC, TiN and Ti(C,N) coatings<br>
with a second metal, such as silicon, vanadium or chromium will, in general, increase<br>
the toughness and other properties such as hardness, oxidation resistance, etc. of the<br>
coating to increase the life of the coated parts.<br>
It has been demonstrated hereinabove that the addition of alloying elements<br>
such as Si, Cr, and V to Ti(C,N) type coating layers for cutting tool bits enhances the<br>
effective tool life of machine tools operating under a wide range of machining<br>
processes on a wide range of work-piece materials. It has further been demonstrated<br>
that such alloy coatings may be deposited by CVD.<br>
Optimization for specific purposes is crucial. One factor at a time experimental<br>
methods are difficult to perform for complex processes but standard R&amp;D techniques<br>
for quantifying the effect of incremental changes to process parameters, specifically<br>
deposition temperatures and the relative proportions of the various elements in the<br>
coating are expected to lead to improved coatings.<br>
Thus the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and<br>
includes both combinations and sub combinations of the various features described<br>
hereinabove as well as variations and modifications thereof, which would occur to<br>
persons skilled in the art upon reading the foregoing description.<br>
