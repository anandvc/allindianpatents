1.  TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
TREATMENT FOR FABRICS<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, of Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.<br>
2-1-2004<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Treatment for Fabrics<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an oligomeric or polymeric material for deposition onto a fabric to endow a fabric care or other benefit to the fabric.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is known to use polysaccharide gums having a B1-4 linkage (hereinafter referred to as 6-1,4-polysaccharides) as ingredients in detergent compositions, e.g. guar gum when used as a thickener in bleach compositions and liquid fabric washing compositions, and as additives to detergent powder e.g. to improve the structural and/or free-flowing properties of the powders.<br>
It is also known to use various different materials in laundry products for colour care, e.g. to reduce the fading of coloured dyes in the fabric due to repeated washes.<br>
It is has now been found by.the applicants that surprisingly, B1-4 polysaccharides also are useful in detergent products for fabric care benefits such as colour care performance, as well as anti-pilling. Unfortunately, at the levels required for this purpose, the applicants have noticed a negative in terms of enhanced staining with particulate stains on the fabric.<br>
This problem has now been overcome by modifying the naturally occurring polysaccharides that their weight average molecular weight is 250,000 or less.<br><br>
1<br>
Techniques for reducing the molecular weight of naturally occurring polysaccharides are well known in the art.<br>
Degradation of galactomannans, poiyuronic acids and galactans by a thermal process in an oxygen-free atmosphere is described in GB-A-1 042 438.<br>
Galactomannans for anti-gelling of food products, by peroxide or acid hydrolysis is disclosed in GB-A-1 565 006.<br>
GB-A-834 375 describes a method for retarding the degradation of galactomannans in hot aqueous systems by inclusion of certain water-soluble metal salts.<br>
According to US-A-2 553 485, manno-galactans can be heat degraded to modify their adhesive properties.<br>
The acid hydrolysis of partially hydrated carbohydrate gums at elevated temperatures is the subject of WO 93/15116.<br>
Proteolytic degradation of tamarind seed kernel polysaccharide is described in US-A-3 480 511 and Ind. J. Technology, Vol. 8, September 1970, H.C. Srivastava et al,<br>
    pp 347-349.<br>
Another non-laundry use of low molecular polysaccharide is disclosed in GB-A-2 314 840. According to this teaching, polysaccharides having a molecular weight of between 1,000 and 50,000 are useful for wound dressings oR peptide/protein binding.<br>
As far as use of low molecular polysaccharides in surfactant-based products is concerned, EP-A-367 335 discloses use of a cationic guargum having a molecular<br><br>
3<br>
weight of 50,000 -100,000,000 preferably 100,000 - 500,000, especially 250,000 -400,000 to improve the feel of toilet bars based on alkali metal soaps. According to EP-A-227 321, the mildness of soap bars is improved using a hydrated cationic polymeric polysaccharide having from 5-6 saccharide units on average. Another soap bar containing a cationic polysaccharide having a molecular weight of 1,000 -3,000,000, preferably 2,500 - 350,000 is disclosed in US-A-5 064 555.<br>
US-A-4 179 382 discloses a textile softening agent which includes a cationic salt which optionally may be a cationic polysaccharide, e.g. having a molecular weight of 220,000.<br>
However, none of the aforementioned reference discloses a modified low molecular weight naturally occurring polysaccharide as useful for conferring care benefits in fabric treatment products, e.g. for use in the wash and/or rinse.<br>
Definition of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides use of polysaccharide gum having Pi-4 linkages to confer a benefit to a fabric during the laundering thereof, in particular a naturally occurring such polysaccharide. However, preferably the polysaccharide is a modified naturally occurring polysaccharide gum having B1-4 linkages, the modified polysaccharide having a weight average molecular weight of 250,000 or less, preferably 100,000 or less, more preferably 75,000 or less.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Preferably, the weight average molecular weight of the modified polysaccharide is 100,000 or less, more preferably 75,000 or less.<br><br>
4<br>
The molecular weight of the naturally occurring polysaccharide may be reduced by a number of different means, for example by enzymatic cleavage, using an appropriate enzyme such as a cellulase, or mannanase, or by acid hydrolysis, or any other method known in the art. The enzymatic degradation of xyloglucan is disclosed in US 3 480 511. Preferred cellulases include those sold under Trade Marks Celluzyme, Endolase, Carezyme and Puradax.<br>
Typical polysaccharide gums which may be used unmodified or modified, for use in detergent compositions or other treatment products, include galactomannan (e.g. derived from locust bean gum or guar gum), glucomannan (e.g. Konjac glucomannan) xanthan gum and xyloglucan (e.g. tamarind xyloglucan), and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, the polysaccharide is uncharged or is anionic.<br>
Compositions<br>
The polysaccharide may be incorporated into compositions containing only a diluent (which may comprise solid and/or liquid) and/or also comprising an active ingredient. The polysaccharide is typically included in said compositions at levels of from 0.01% to 25% by weight, preferably from 0.1% to 20%, e.g. from 0.5% to 20%, most preferably from 0.2% to 5%. Another preferred range is from 1% to 15%.<br>
Although the modified forms are preferred in some cases, it may be advantageous to use unmodified naturally occurring polysaccharides in detergent compositions. Thus, another aspect of the present invention provides a detergent composition comprising a polysaccharide gum having B1-4 linkages, in particular a modified naturally occurring polysaccharide as hereinbefore defined.<br><br>
5<br>
The active ingredient in the compositions is preferably a surface active agent or a fabric conditioning agent. More than one active ingredient may be included. For some applications a mixture of active ingredients may be used.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be in any physical form e.g. a solid such as a powder or granules, a tablet, a solid bar, a paste, gel or liquid, especially, an aqueous based liquid.<br>
The compositions of the present invention are preferably laundry compositions, especially main wash (fabric washing) compositions or rinse-added softening compositions. The main wash compositions may include a fabric softening agent and rinse-added fabric softening compositions may include surface-active compounds, particularly non-ionic surface-active compounds, if appropriate.<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention may contain a surface-active compound (surfactant) which may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, non-ionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic surface-active compounds and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surface-active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred detergent-active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and non-ionic compounds.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain linear alkylbenzene sulphonate, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chain length of C8-C15. It is preferred if the level of linear alkylbenzene sulphonate is from 0 wt% to 30 wt%, more preferably 1 wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 15 wt%.<br><br>
6<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain other anionic surfactants in amounts additional to the percentages quoted above. Suitable anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art. Examples include primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, particularly C8-C15 primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also contain non-ionic surfactant. Nonionic surfactants that may be used include the primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates, especially the C1-C20 aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and more especially the C10-C15 primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol. Non-ethoxylated nonionic surfactants include alkylpolyglycosides, glycerol monoethers, and polyhydroxyamides (glucamide).<br>
It is preferred if the level of non-ionic surfactant is from 0 wt% to 30 wt%, preferably from 1 wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 15 wt%.<br>
It is also possible to include certain mono-alkyl cationic surfactants which can be used in main-wash compositions for fabrics. Cationic surfactants that may be used include quaternary ammonium salts of the general formula R1R2R3R4N+ X" wherein the R       groups are long or short hydrocarbon chains, typically alkyl, hydroxyalkyl or<br>
ethoxylated alkyl groups, and X is a counter-ion (for example, compounds in which R\ is a C8-C22 alkyl group, preferably a C8-C10o or C12-C14 alkyl group, R2 is a methyl<br>
group, and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups); and cationic esters (for example, choline esters).<br>
The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant), and the amount present, will depend on the intended use of the detergent composition. In fabric washing<br><br>
7<br>
compositions, different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known to the skilled fonnulator, for handwashing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machine.<br>
The total amount of surfactant present will also depend on the intended end use and may be as high as 60 wt%, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand. In compositions for machine washing of fabrics, an amount of from 5 to 40 wt% is generally appropriate. Typically the compositions will comprise at least 2 wt% surfactant e.g. 2-60%, preferably 15-40% most preferably 25-35%.<br>
Detergent compositions suitable for use in most automatic fabric washing machines generally contain anionic non-soap surfactant, or non-ionic surfactant, or combinations of the two in any suitable ratio, optionally together with soap.<br>
The compositions of the invention, when used as main wash fabric washing compositions, will generally also contain one or more detergency builders. The total amount of detergency builder in the compositions will typically range from 5 to 80 wt%, preferably from 10 to 60 wt%.<br>
Inorganic builders that may be present include sodium carbonate, if desired in combination with a crystallisation seed for calcium carbonate, as disclosed in GB 1 437 950 (Unilever); crystalline and amorphous aluminosilicates, for example, zeolites as disclosed in GB 1 473 201 (Henkel), amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1<br>
473 202 (Henkel) and mixed crystalline/amorphous aluminosilicates as disclosed in GB 1 470 250 (Procter &amp; Gamble); and layered silicates as disclosed in EP 164 514B (Hoechst). Inorganic phosphate builders, for example, sodium orthophosphate, pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate are also suitable for use with this invention.<br><br>
8<br>
The compositions of the invention preferably contain an alkali metal, preferably sodium, aluminosilicate builder. Sodium aluminosilicates may generally be incorporated in amounts of from 10 to 70% by weight (anhydrous basis), preferably from 25 to 50 wt%.<br>
The alkali metal aluminosilicate may be either crystalline or amorphous or mixtures thereof, having the general formula: 0.8-1.5 Na20. AI2O3. 0.8-6 Si02<br>
These materials contain some bound water and are required to have a calcium ion exchange capacity of at least 50 mg CaO/g. The preferred sodium aluminosilicates contain 1.5-3.5 SiCO2 units (in the formula above). Both the amorphous and the crystalline materials can be prepared readily by reaction between sodium silicate and sodium aluminate. as amply described in the literature. Suitable crystalline sodium aluminosilicate ion-exchange detergency builders are described, for example, in GB I 429 143 (Procter &amp; Gamble). The preferred sodium aluminosilicates of this type are the well-known commercially available zeolites A and X, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The zeolite may be the commercially available zeolite 4A now widely used in laundry detergent powders. However, according to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the zeolite builder incorporated in the compositions of the invention is maximum aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384 070A (Unilever). Zeolite MAP<br>
is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of the zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, and more preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.20.<br>
Especially preferred is zeolite MAP having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.07, more preferably about 1.00. The calcium binding capacity of zeolite MAP is generally at least 150 mg CaO per g of anhydrous material.<br><br>
9<br>
Organic builders that may be present include polycarboxylate polymers such as polyacrylates, acrylic/maleic copolymers, and acrylic phosphonates; monomelic polycarboxylates such as citrates, gluconates, oxydisuccinates, glycerol mono-, di and trisuccinates, carboxymethyloxy succinates, carboxymethyloxymalonates, dipicolinates, hydroxyethyliminodiacetates, alkyl- and alkenylmalonates and succinates; and sulphonated fatty acid salts. This list is not intended to be exhaustive.<br>
Especially preferred organic builders are citrates, suitably used in amounts of from 5 to 30 wt%, preferably from 10 to 25 wt%; and acrylic polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers, suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt%, preferably from 1 to 10 wt%.<br>
Builders, both inorganic and organic, are preferably present in alkali metal salt, especially sodium salt, form.<br>
Compositions according to the invention may also suitably contain a bleach system. Fabric washing compositions may desirably contain peroxy bleach compounds, for example, inorganic persalts or organic peroxyacids, capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution.<br>
Suitable peroxy bleach compounds include organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates and persulphates. Preferred inorganic persalts are sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate, and sodium percarbonate.<br>
Especially preferred is sodium percarbonate having a protective coating against destabilisation by moisture. Sodium percarbonate having a protective coating comprising sodium metaborate and sodium silicate is disclosed in GB 2 123 044B (Kao).<br>
The peroxy bleach compound is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 35 wt%, preferably from 0.5 to 25 wt%. The peroxy bleach compound may be used in conjunction<br><br>
10<br>
with a bleach activator (bleach precursor) to improve bleaching action at low wash temperatures. The bleach precursor is suitably present in an amount of from 0.1 to 8 wt%, preferably from 0.5 to 5 wt%.<br>
Preferred bleach precursors are peroxycarboxyhc acid precursors, more especially peracetic acid precursors and pemoanoic acid precursors. Especially preferred bleach precursors suitable for use in the present invention are N,N,N",N",-tetracetyl ethylenediamine (TAED) and sodium noanoyloxybenzene sulphonate (SNOBS). The novel quaternary ammonium and phosphonium bleach precursors disclosed in US 4 751 015 and US 4 818 426 (Lever Brothers Company) and EP 402 971A (Unilever), and the cationic bleach precursors disclosed in EP 284 292A and EP 303 520A (Kao) are also of interest.<br>
The bleach system can be either supplemented with or replaced by a peroxyacid. examples of such peracids can be found in US 4 686 063 and US 5 397 501 (Unilever). A preferred example is the imido peroxycarboxyhc class of peracids described in EP A 325 288, EP A 349 940, DE 382 3172 and EP 325 289. A particularly preferred example is phtalimido peroxy caproic acid (PAP). Such peracids are suitably present at 0.1 - 12%, ; preferably 0.5 -10%.<br>
A bleach stabiliser (transition metal sequestrant) may also be present. Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetra-acetate (EDTA), the polyphosphonates such as<br>
Dequest (Trade Mark) and non-phosphate stabilisers such as EDDS (ethylene diamine di-succinic acid). These bleach stabilisers are also useful for stain removal especially in products containing low levels of bleaching species or no bleaching species.<br>
An especially preferred bleach system comprises a peroxy bleach compound (preferably sodium percarbonate optionally together with a bleach activator), and a transition metal<br><br>
11<br>
bleach catalyst as described and claimed in EP 458 397A ,EP 458 398A and EP 509 787A (Unilever).<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also contain one or more enzyme(s). Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation in detergent compositions. Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are, catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction. They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin.<br>
Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available and can be used in the instant invention. Examples of suitable proteolytic enzymes are trie subtilins which are obtained from particular strains of B. Subtilis B. licheniformis, such as the commercially available subtilisins Maxatase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Gist Brocades N.V., Delft, Holland, and Alcalase (Trade Mark), as supplied by Novo Industri A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark.<br>
Particularly suitable is a protease obtained from a strain of Bacillus having maximum activity throughout the pH range of 8-12, being commercially available, e.g. from Novo Industri A/S under the registered trade-names Esperase (Trade Mark) and Savinase (Trade-Mark). The preparation of these and analogous enzymes is described in GB 1 243 785. Other commercial proteases are Kazusase (Trade Mark obtainable from<br>
Showa-Denko of Japan), Optimase (Trade Mark from Miles Kali-Chemie, Hannover, West Germany), and Superase (Trade Mark obtainable from Pfizer of U.S. A.).<br>
Detergency enzymes are commonly employed in granular form in amounts of from about 0.1 to about 3.0 wt%. However, any suitable physical form of enzyme may be used.<br><br>
12<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain alkali metal, preferably sodium carbonate, in order to increase detergency and ease processing. Sodium carbonate may suitably be present in amounts ranging from 1 to 60 wt%, preferably from 2 to 40 wt%. However, compositions containing little or no sodium carbonate are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
Powder flow may be improved by the incorporation of a small amount of a powder structurant, for example, a fatty acid (or fatty acid soap), a sugar, an acrylate or acrylate/maleate copolymer, or sodium silicate. One preferred powder structurant is fatty acid soap, suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 5 wt%.<br>
Other materials that may be present in detergent compositions of the invention include sodium silicate; antiredeposition agents such as cellulosic polymers; soil release polymers; inorganic salts such as sodium sulphate; lather control agents or lather boosters as appropriate; proteolytic and lipolytic enzymes; dyes; coloured speckles; perfumes; foam controllers; fluorescers and decoupling polymers. This list is not intended to be<br>
exhaustive. However, many of these ingredients will be better delivered as benefit agent groups in materials according to the first aspect of the invention.<br>
The detergent composition when diluted in the wash liquor (during a typical wash cycle) will typically give a pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.<br>
Particulate detergent compositions are suitably prepared by spray-drying a slurry of compatible heat-insensitive ingredients, and then spraying on or post-dosing those ingredients unsuitable for processing via the slurry. The skilled detergent formulator will have no difficulty in deciding which ingredients should be included in the slurry and which should not.<br><br>
13<br>
Particulate detergent compositions of the invention preferably have a bulk density of at least 400 g/1, more preferably at least 500 g/1. Especially preferred compositions have bulk densities of at least 650 g/litre, more preferably at least 700 g/litre.<br>
Such powders may be prepared either by post-tower densifi cation of spray-dried powder, or by wholly non-tower methods such as dry mixing and granulation; in both cases a hiqh-speed mixer/granulator may advantageously be used. Processes using high-speed mixer/granulators are disclosed, for example, in EP 340 013A, EP 367 339A, EP 390 251A and EP 420 317A (Unilever).<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in compact form which means it will contain a lower level of water compared to a conventional liquid detergent<br>
Any suitable method may be used to produce the compounds of the present invention. In particular polymerisation of the sunscreen and/or SOQ and polymer as described in the examples may be used.<br>
Treatment<br>
The treatment of the fabric with the material of the invention can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing of the fabric.<br>
Example 1: Enzvmatic Degradation of Xvloglucan<br>
(1) The xyloglucan solution was prepared in the following way Srivastava H.C., Harshe, S.N.; Mudia, C.P.; but J. Technology, 1970, 8, 347-349.<br><br>
14<br>
50g of material was slowly added to 3 litres of demineralised water under high agitation by a stirrer (from above) in a 51 glass beaker. The stirring was continued at room temperature for about 15 minutes and the temperature was raised to 40 degrees Celsius, while stirring. The solution was stirred until all of the polymer had dissolved and a 1ml sample was taken for analysis.<br>
0.2g of cellulase (Clazinase liquid) were added. The solution was then firmly stirred at 40°C for 1V2 hours and then a 1ml sample was taken. The viscosity of both the "before" and "after" samples was measured on a Carri-med CSL 100 Controlled Stress Rheometer, carefully following the instructions on the safety sheet. The temperature of the solution was raised to 80°C to denature the enzyme and the solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and then freeze dried.<br>
The molecular weight of the xyloglucan before and after the treatment was measured by gel permeation chromatography. The native xyloglucan has a Mw of 230.000, after the treatment it was in the order of 30.000 g/mol. The molecular weight distribution had increased considerably.<br>
Example 2: Acid hvdrolvsis of locust bean gum<br>
The galactomannan solution are prepared in the following way: 30 gram of material was added to 3 litre of demineralised water under high agitation by a stirrer (from above) in a glass beaker. The stirring was continued at room temperature for about 15 minutes, then the stirring is stopped. The glass beaker was placed on a steam heater plate and the temperature is raised to 80 degrees Celsius, while stirring.<br>
From a 1 M HCl solution was added enough to decrease the pH to 1.8. The solution was then firmly stirred for another 3 hours. The temperature and pH were checked regulary,<br><br>
15<br>
keeping them constant at or adjusted to 80 degrees and 1.8, respectively. The solution was then allowed to cool down to room temperature and the pH adjusted to neutral with a solution of NaOH.<br>
The solution was centrifuged in a Centricon 124 (Colloid Science) at 8500 rpm (lOOOOg) for 90 minutes using the 6 x 500 rota. The beakers were each weighed and adjusted to have the same mass within 0.5 g. The supernatant was decanted-off.<br>
The supernatant (SN) was alcohol-exchanged by mixing one volume of SN with four volumes of propan-2-ol (IPA). This procedure was executed step-wise involving no more than 2 litres of IP A per step. This mixture was hand-stirred with a glass rod. The low MW-modified locust bean gum precipitated as a gelatinous material, which was removed from the liquid and retained. The gels obtained from each temperature fraction were washed three times with neat IP A. This was carried out using a Buchner funnel lined with miracloth or a fine nylon mesh.<br>
The product was placed in acetone to purge the material of alcohol and residual water and was left to stand for 1 hour covered with foil in a fume cabinet. The acetone was exchanged for fresh solvent and stood for another hour. The acetone was exchanged once more and the gels allowed to soak overnight in the fume cabinet.<br>
The LBG gel was seen to turn from translucent to opaque white. It was broken-up into small pieces during the acetone exchange steps. The gel fractions were drained through a Buchner funnel (with medium glass fibre filter paper) to remove free acetone. The product was vacuum dried for three days at 40°C and subsequently stored at ambient in a dry sealed pot.<br><br>

Example 5: comparative test<br>
Fabrics<br>
A multi wash was performed in the presence on locust bean gum. In the multiwash a<br>
whole range of different materials were used, including real garments. This made it<br>
possible to determine whether the presence of locust bean gum, in a series of main wash<br>
cycles, had any effects on the properties of various fabrics. The fabric properties studied<br>
were:<br>
pilling (Blue cotton interlock new and prepilled)<br><br>
18<br>
colour fastness of the fabric (standard fabrics and a variety of bought garments, coloured cotton, knitted and woven and viscose) both printed and dyed, microscopic fibre damage (white cotton and viscose)<br>
Multiwash (15 washes).<br>
Before the multiwash, all the fabrics were measured on the spectraflash. The multiwash was carried out using two computerised front loading automatic machines (one with polymer present and a control with no polymer). Fifteen washes were carried out with no drying steps between the washes<br>
Control<br>
To each of the 15 washes was added:<br>
250ml of 0.64M carbonate buffer<br>
250ml of 32g/l (50:50 LAS/A7) surfactant solution<br>
500ml of demineralised water<br>
-~0.25g of Dow Coming silicone antifoam<br>
Test<br>
To each of the 15 washes was added:<br>
250ml of 0.64M carbonate buffer 250ml of 32g/l (50:50 LAS/A7) surfactant solution 500ml of 8g/l locust bean gum solution (-80% active) -0.25g of Dow Coming silicone antifoam<br>
Total carbonate buffer concentration was 0.01M. Total surfactant concentration was 0.5g/l. Final polymer concentration was 0.20g/l.<br><br>
19<br>
Ballast cotton was added to both fabric loads to make them up to 2kg each. The machines used 16L of water this gave a liquor to cloth ratio of 8:1. Both machines were put on a 40°C cycle.<br>
Three replicate sets of the fabrics were used. Two of these sets were added from the first<br>
wash. In this way the washload was kept constant throughout the experiment. After the<br>
  multiwash three sets of fabrics were obtained that only differed in the number of wash<br>
cycles (5,10 &amp;15). After the full 15 washes all fabrics were viewed to determine    whether the locust bean gum had any effect on the properties of the cloth. All cloths<br>
  were measured on the spectraflash to observe any changes in colour. Most were<br>
  panelled, i.e. blue cotton interlock for pilling, and the others for general appearance and<br>
  colour.<br><br><br>
  Results<br><br>
  Electron microscopy<br><br>
  Woven cotton and viscose clothes washed in the different conditions have been studied<br><br>
  by electron microscopy. The electron micrographs clearly showed less damage in the   presence of locust bean gum compared to the control.<br>
Effects on coloured fabrics Instrumental analysis results<br><br>

The reflectance of the fabrics was measured before washing and after 5,10 and 15 wash cycles. The results in the table are an average of the following six fabrics:<br>
Imperon yellow KR + PBA Imperon yellow KR + PB50 Imperon red KR + PBA Imperon red KR + PB50 Imperon blue KR + PBA Imperon blue KR + PB50<br>
Other dyed fabrics used in the multiwash include:<br>
Hydron blue (15%) (ex Hoechst) on woven cotton Indigo (ex BASF) on woven cotton Combination of vat dyes* on woven cotton<br>
*Indian-Threne Grey S607 Coll, Green FFB Coll, and Yellow 65 Coll, all ex CIBA<br>
These fabrics have been panelled and the preference scores (average of three) are given below.<br><br>
	5 WASHES	10 WASHES	15 WASHES<br>
LBG preferred	23	20	20<br>
control preferred	7	10	10<br>

The preference scores, for both the new and pre-pilled blue cotton interlock are given in  the table below.<br><br>
21<br><br>
	5 WASHES	10 WASHES	15 WASHES<br>
new, LBG preferred/10	7	9	10<br>
pre-pilled, LBG preferred/10	9	10	9<br>
Example 6: comparative test<br>
Conditions are the same as in example 5. Now four different test conditions have been used and were compared against a control. Locust bean gum native, acid hydrolysed locust bean gum, enzymatically hydrolysed tamarind xyloglucan and konjac gluccomannan. ten washes were performed and the fabrics were dried in the tumble dryer between every wash.<br>
Results<br>
A clearly visible benefit was seen on prints on knitted cotton pyjama shirts. All six panellist preferred the test fabrics (for all four test conditions) above the control.<br>
Example 7: staining with low molecular weight locust bean gum<br>
Conditions are the same as in example 5. White woven cotton fabrics were washed once in the different conditions (locust bean gum and hydrolysed locust bean gum and control). They were subsequently stained with clay and washed again in the same condition. The difference in reflectance of the stain before and after washing, which is a measure of the stain removal, was measured and the results are given in the-table below.<br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A method for reducing visible surface damage to fabric during laundering which comprises the step of treating the fabric with an uncharged or anionic modified naturally occurring polysaccharide gum having fli_4 linkages, the modified polysaccharide having a weight average molecular weight of 250,000 or less, preferably 100,000 or less, more preferably 75,000 or less, to confer a benefit in terms of staining with particulate stains on a textile fabric during laundering thereof.<br>
2.	Method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the modified polysaccharide is derived from a naturally occurring polysaccharide selected from galactomannan (e.g. derived from locust bean gum or guar gum), glucomannan (e.g. Konjac glucommannan), xyloglucan (e.g. tamarind xyloglucan), xanthan gum and mixtures thereof.<br>
3.	A method as claimed in anyone of claims 1 or 2 wherein the treatment composition optionally comprises a surfactant.<br>
4.	A method as claimed in claim 3 wherein the amount of said surfactant is from 5% to 50% by weight of the treatment composition and the amount of modified polysaccharide is from 0.01% to 25% by weight of the treatment composition.<br><br>
