Method for the production of substituted thiophenesulfonyl isocyanates<br>
The invention relates to a novel process for preparing 2,4-disubstituted thiophene-3-sulfonyl isocyanates which are described as intermediates for active ingredients in agriculture, especially for substituted herbicidally active thienylaminocarbonyltriazolinones (cf. WO 01/05788) and sulfonylureas (WO 01/10863).<br>
It is known that certain substituted thienylsulfonyl isocyanates can be prepared by phosgenation in the presence of organic bases, in particular the base DABCO, from the corresponding sulfonamides (EP-A 30 142, US-A 4,481,029). However, a disadvantage of this process is that an expensive organic base has to be used.<br>
It has now been found in accordance with the invention that the preparation of the specific substituted 2-alkyl-4-alkoxycarbonyl-disubstituted thiophene-3-sulfonyl isocyanates can likewise be carried out in high yield without significant formation of by-products without adding the customary bases.<br><br>
in which<br>
R1        is alkoxy having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, and R2        is alkyl having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, are obtained in very good yields and in high purity<br><br>
in which R and R are as defined above<br><br>
are reacted with phosgene in the absence of a base and in the presence of one or more diluents and also optionally of a catalyst.<br>
In the formula (I), R is preferably methoxy, ethoxy, n- or i-propoxy. R is preferably methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl. R is more preferably methoxy. R is more preferably methyl.<br>
By virtue of the reaction of the sulfonamides without use of an organic base, a new process has surprisingly been found which allows the preparation of the 2,4-disubstituted thienyl-3-sulfonyl isocyanates in very good yields and in high purity with a short reaction time.<br>
The process according to the invention thus constitutes an enrichment of the prior art since it allows a very advantageous preparation of 2,4-disubstituted thienyl-3-sulfonyl isocyanates. The access to the herbicidal thienylaminocarbonyltriazolinones and sulfonylureas based on these intermediates is thus eased.<br>
The compounds of the formula (II) are known and can be prepared as specified in WO 01/05788 or by processes known in principle (cf.s for example, EP-A 30 412, US-A 4,481,029).<br>
In the inventive reaction of the substituted sulfonamides with phosgene, operation is effected generally at temperatures between 20°C and 170°C, preferably between 100°C and 150°C, more preferably between 125°C and 135°C The diluents used in the reaction are preferably optionally halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, for example chlorobenzene, toluene or xylene. Xylene and chlorobenzene are particularly preferred as diluents.<br>
In the inventive reaction of the sulfonamides with phosgene, the reaction times are generally between 30 minutes and 6 hours, preferably between 2 and 4 hours.<br>
To carry out the process according to the invention, the compounds of the formula (I) are prepared preferably by using the reagent in an equimolar amount or in excess. In general, between 1.0 and 10 mol, preferably between 1.0 and 3 mol, of phosgene are used per mole of sulfonamide of the formula (II). However, greater excesses of phosgene may also be used in accordance with the invention.<br>
The process according to the invention is carried out generally under standard pressure. However, it is also possible to carry out the process according to the invention under elevated or reduced pressure, generally between 0.1 bar and 10 bar.<br>
The process according to the invention should advantageously be carried out in the presence of a catalyst. The catalyst used may be a catalytically active amount of a butyl isocyanate or pentyl isocyanate. The preferred concentration of this isocyanate in the reaction is from 0.1<br><br>
to 5 mol per mole of sulfonamide, preferably from 0.7 to 1.3 mol.<br>
By their nature, the substituted sulfonamides can also be reacted with the isocyanate used as a catalyst to give the corresponding ureas. These can then be reacted in a second step with phosgene likewise to give the corresponding isocyanates.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) obtained by the process according to the invention may be isolated before they are used to prepare herbicidal end products. However, it is also possible to react the resulting compounds further directly without intermediate isolation. It is even preferred to prepare herbicidal thienylsulfonylaminocarbonyltriazolinones by reacting the resulting compounds of the formula (I) directly with the amines (for example the triazolinones).<br>
The present invention therefore also provides a process in which the compounds of the formula (I) are reacted with a triazolinone in a subsequent reaction step without intermediate isolation ("one-pot process", cf. preparation example 3).<br><br><br>
23.5 g of methyl 4-(aminosulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (1) (100 mmol) were initially charged in 250 ml of xylene. From this mixture, approx. 70 ml of xylene were distilled off on a water separator. After addition of 9.9 g of n-butyl isocyanate (100 mmol), the reaction mixture was heated to reflux. Subsequently, 24 g of phosgene were introduced over a period of 3 h at such a rate that the temperature remained at approx. 130°C (excess phosgene was kept in the system by a phosgene condenser). For workup, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and excess phosgene was removed by passing an argon stream through. Subsequently, distillative purification was effected, in which the butyl isocyanate can be recovered. The methyl 4-(isocyanatosulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (2) can then be recovered as a colorless solid after a distillation under reduced pressure. 22 g of the methyl 4-(isocyanatosulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (2) were obtained (83% of theory, content: 98%, b.p.: 120°C, 0.4 mbar). The identification and the determination of content were conducted by means of derivatization with methanol to the corresponding carbamate (JH NMR (400 MHz, d6DMSO): 2.72 (s), 3.61 (s), 3.79 (s), 8.00 (s), 11.96 (s)).<br>
Example 2<br>
Under the conditions specified above, 23.5 g of methyl 4-(aminosulfonyl)-5-methyl-thiophene-3-carboxylate (1) were reacted with 11.3 g of pentyl isocyanate (100 mmol) in the presence of phosgene to give methyl 4-(isocyanatosulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (2). 22 g of this isocyanate (83% of theory, content: 99%, b.p.: 120°C, 0.4 mbar) were likewise obtained. The identification and the determination of content were conducted by means of derivatization with methanol to the corresponding carbamate (]H NMR (400 MHz, d6DMSO): 2.72 (s), 3.61 (s), 3.79 (s), 8.00 (s), 11.96 (s)).<br><br><br>
12.9 g of 5-methoxy-4-methyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one (3) (100 mmol) were initially charged in 200 ml of xylene and heated to 70°C. At this temperature, 119 g of a 22% solution of methyl 4-(isocyanatosulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (2) (100 mmol) in dry xylene were metered in. The mixture was stirred at 70°C for a further 5.8 h. Subsequently, workup was effected at room temperature by filtering the precipitated product. After washing with 50 ml of xylene and subsequently drying, 36.4 g of methyl 4-({[(3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-4,5-dihydro-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)carbonyl]amino}-sulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (4) (91% of theory, content relative to standard: 97.5%) of melting point 201°C were obtained.<br>
Alternatively to the two-step procedure (separate preparation of the isocyanate and subsequent reaction with the amine), it is possible, after the phosgene has been removed (isocyanate preparation) and the isocyanate used as a catalyst has been distilled off, to react the xylenic solution obtained from the preparation of methyl 4-(isocyanatosulfonyl)-5-methylthiophene-3-carboxylate (2) directly with the amine ("one-pot process")- Removal of the isocyanate used as a catalyst is not absolutely necessary for the success of the reaction with the amine.<br><br><br>
