CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit under Indian Provisional Application no. 441/MUM/2004 filed April 13, 2004 and entitled "PROCESS FOR THE PURIFICATION OF FLUCONAZOLE", the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field<br>
The present invention generally relates to processes for the purification of fluconazole.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fluconazole (also known as 2,4-difluoro-a,a1-bis-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-ylmethyl) benzyl alcohol) of Formula I:<br><br>
Fluconazole is a synthetic triazole antifungal agent sold under the brand name Diflucan®. Fluconazole is a highly selective inhibitor of fungal cytochrome P-450 sterol C-14 alpha-demethylation. Fluconazole is indicated for the treatment of vaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infections due to Candida), oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, and cryptococcal meningitis. See, e.g., The Merck Index, Thirteenth Edition, 2001, p. 728-29, monograph 4148; and Physician's Desk Reference, "Diflucan," 58th Edition, pp. 2590-2594 (2003).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,404,216 ("the '216 patent"), herein incorporated by reference, discloses fluconazole. The '216 patent further discloses processes for the preparation of fluconazole. These processes for the preparation of fluconazole suffer from numerous drawbacks, most pertinent of which is the production of impurities. Thus, it would be advantageous to reduce the level of impurities in the preparation of fluconazole.<br>
Some impurities that are present in the production of fluconazole include the following which were determined from an HPLC analysis of different batches of fluconazole produced by the        reaction        of        l-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-2-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)ethanone        with<br>
2<br><br>
trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and 1,2,4-triazole in the presence of sodium hydroxide, and identified below in Scheme I:<br>
Scheme I<br><br>
These impurities can be divided into two types: Type 1 impurities (A to D) formed during the synthesis of fluconazole and are characterized as process related and Type 2 impurity (E) related to intermediates of the process used to prepare fluconazole, which is carried into the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) without conversion. Each of these impurities are typically present in a range of from about 0.1% to about 3.5%.<br>
Impurity A: (R,S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-1 -(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1 -yl)-3-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl) propanol. The structural isomer of fluconazole was present in amounts ranging from about 0.5% to about 1% following synthesis. This impurity forms because the nitrogen at the 4th position of the triazole ring competes with the nitrogen of the 1st position during the reaction with an epoxide. Some amount of equilibrium exists between 1H and 4H forms. This impurity is the most difficult to remove from crude fluconazole.<br>
Impurity B: 2-[2-fluoro-4-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)phenyl]-l,3-di lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl) propan-2-ol. This impurity is present in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 0.3% following synthesis. A 1,2,4-triazole can react with aromatic fluorine to form this impurity.<br>
Impurity C: (2S)-2-[2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl) propane-1,2-diol. This impurity is present in amounts ranging from about 3% to about 3.5% following synthesis. This<br>
3<br><br>
dihydroxy impurity forms because hydrolysis of the epoxide occurs during ring opening of the epoxide with 1,2,4-triazole.<br>
Impurity D: 2-(2,4-di-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl phenyl)-1,3-di-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl propan-2-ol. This impurity is present in amounts ranging from about 0.5% to about 1% following synthesis. This impurity forms for one of two reasons, either by disubstitution of aromatic fluorine in fluconazole with 1,2,4-triazole, or impurity B can further react with 1,2,4-triazole to produce disubstituted products.<br>
Impurity E: l-(2,4-difluoro phenyl)-2-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl) ethanone. This intermediate is present in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 0.3%. This impurity may be present because the intermediate has been unreacted. The unreacted intermediate ends up in the API.<br>
Efforts are made to prepare pharmaceutical products of a high grade and with a minimum amount of impurities present. The control of impurities requires a study of various options to decide upon the reaction conditions and testing protocols necessary to insure that drugs which are administered to the public are substantially pure. Accordingly, there remains a need for an improved process for preparing fluconazole that eliminates or substantially reduces the impurities in a convenient and cost efficient manner to provide highly purified fluconazole.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
One aspect of the present invention is directed to substantially pure fluconazole which comprises less than about 0.05 weight % of at least one compound selected from the group consisting of (R,S)-2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)-l-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)-3-(4H-l,2,4-triazol-4-yl) propanol, 2-[2-fluoro-4-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)phenyl]-l,3-di lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl) propan-2-ol, (2S)-2-[2,4-difluorophenyl)-3-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl) propane-1,2-diol, 2-(2,4-di-1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl phenyl)-1,3-di-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl propan-2-ol, l-(2,4-difluoro phenyl)-2-(lH-1,2,4-triazol-l-yl) ethanone and mixtures thereof.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a process for the formation of highly purified fluconazole and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof from crude fluconazole. It has been found that water mixed with organic solvents advantageously eliminates the impurities found in crude fluconazole (i.e., fluconazole which is less than about 97% pure), particularly, impurities A to E as discussed above. Accordingly in one embodiment of the present invention,<br>
6<br><br>
the purification process includes at least the steps of (a) a first leaching of crude fluconazole, (b) a second leaching of the product of the step (a), and (c) an acid/base treatment of the product of step (b).<br>
In step (a), crude fluconazole is added to an aqueous solvent solution including at least water, one or more aliphatic esters and one or more ketones. The aliphatic esters which can be used in the compositions according to the invention can be linear or branched and can contain from 2 to 20 carbon atoms and preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms. For example, the esters can be of the formula R'COOR wherein R' and R can be the same or different and can be straight or branched alkyl groups having 1 to 10 carbon atoms. The esters can be derivatives of a carboxylic acid having at least 2 carbon atoms or can be derivatives of an alkanol such as, for example, methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, and the like. Suitable aliphatic esters include, but are not limited to, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate, sec-butyl acetate, tert-butyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
[0029]	Suitable ketones include those having from 3 to about  12 carbon atoms.<br>
Representative examples include, but are not limited to, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, methyl propyl ketone, methyl isopropyl ketone, ethyl propyl ketone, ethyl isopropyl ketone, dipropyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone, methyl butyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, methyl sec butyl ketone, methyl tert-butyl ketone, ethyl butyl ketone, ethyl isobutyl ketone, ethyl sec-butyl ketone, ethyl tert-butyl ketone, propyl butyl ketone, isopropyl butyl ketone, propyl isobutyl ketone, propyl sec-butyl ketone, propyl tert butyl ketone, isopropyl isobutyl ketone, isopropyl sec-butyl ketone, isopropyl tert-butyl ketone, dibutyl ketone, diisobutyl ketone, di-sec-butyl ketone, di-tert-butyl ketone, butyl isobutyl ketone, butyl sec-butyl ketone, butyl tert-butyl ketone, isobutyl sec-butyl ketone, isobutyl tert-butyl ketone, sec-butyl tert-butyl ketone, 5-heptanone, 5-methyl-2-hexanone (methyl isoamyl ketone), 4-methyl-2-hexanone, 3-methyl-2-hexanone, 3,4-dimethyl-2-pentanone, 3,3-dimethyl-2-pentanone, 4,4-dimethyl-2-pentanone, 3-octanone, 4-methyl-3-heptanone, 5-methyl-3-heptanone, 6-methyl-3-heptanone, 4,4-dimethyl-3-hexanone, 4,5-dimethyl-3-hexanone, 5,5-dimethyl-3-hexanone, 4-nonanone, 5-methyl-4-octanone, 6-methyl-4-octanone, 7-methyl-4-octanone, 5,5-dimethyl-4-neptanone, 5,6-dimethyl-4-heptanone,    6,6-dimethyl-4-heptanone,    2-undecanone,    cyclopropanone,    cyclobutanone,<br>
7<br><br>
cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone, cyclooctanone, cyclononanone, cyclodecanone, cycloundecanone, cyclododecanone and the like and mixtures thereof.<br>
In step (a), crude fluconazole is added to an aqueous solvent solution wherein water may be present in a ratio in the range of from about 1:3 w/v to about 1:6 w/v with respect to the crude fluconazole. The aliphatic ester, e.g., ethyl acetate, may be present in a ratio in the range of from about 1:0.2 w/v to about 1:0.5 w/v with respect to the crude fluconazole. The ketone, e.g., acetone, may be present in a ratio ordinarily ranging from about 1:0.2 w/v to about 1:0.7 w/v with respect to the crude fluconazole. The fluconazole and solvent solution may be heated to a temperature in the range of from about 55°C to about 65°C for a time period ordinarily ranging from about 30 to about 60 minutes. When the solvent solution with respect to crude fluconazole is in the range of from about 1:5:0.2-0.7:0.2-0.7 w/v (water:aliphatic ester:ketone) a suspension is formed. When the ratio of the solvent solution with respect to crude fluconazole is higher, a solution is formed. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature, a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 30°C. The resulting solid in the suspension is then separated out utilizing conventional techniques, e.g., filtration. Alternatively, when a solution is formed, the purified fluconazole and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be separated out by crystallization.<br>
In step (b), the second leaching comprises the steps of adding the product obtained from step (a), i.e., the solid, to a second solvent solution including at least water, one or more aliphatic esters and one or more ketones. The aliphatic ester and ketone employed in the second solvent solution can be any of the aliphatic esters and ketones described hereinabove and can be the same or different as the aliphatic ester and ketone employed in the first solvent solution. The water may be present in the second solvent solution in a ratio of from about 1:3 w/v to about 1:6 w/v with respect to the product of step (a). The aliphatic ester, e.g., ethyl acetate, may be present in the second solvent solution in a ratio of from about 1:0.2 w/v to about 1:0.5 w/v with respect to the product of step (a). The ketone, e.g., acetone, may be present in the second solvent solution in a ratio in the range of from about 1:0.2 w/v to about 1:0.7 w/v with respect to the product of step (a). The product of step (a) and the solvent solution may be heated to a temperature in the range of from about 55°C to about 65°C for about 30 to about 60 minutes. When the solvent solution with respect to the product of step (a) is in the range of from about 1:5:0.2-0.7:0.2-0.7 w/v (water:ethyl acetate:acetone) a suspension is formed.  When the ratio is<br>
8<br><br>
higher, a solution is formed. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature, a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 30°C. The resulting solid in the suspension can then be separated out utilizing conventional techniques, e.g., filtration. The solid obtained can then be washed with chilled water, to further reduce the impurity content. Alternatively, when a solution is formed, the purified fluconazole and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be separated out by crystallization.<br>
In step (c), an acid/base treatment is performed by, for example (i) dissolving the fluconazole product of step (b) in at least a one or more suitable solvents, e.g. demineralized water, and one or more aqueous acids until the mixture is acidic (e.g. until the pH is about 5.8 to about 8, and preferably about 6.8 to about 7.0) and separating the aqueous layer containing fluconazole, (ii) discarding the organic phase containing impurities, (iii) making the aqueous layer basic by addition of a base, and (iv) dissolving the mixture in at least an organic solvent. In another embodiment, the acid/base treatment can be carried out by, for example, first extracting the aqueous layer containing the fluconazole of step (b) at least three times with an aromatic solvent, e.g., toluene, (about 1:0.5 w/v, fluconazole:toluene) and separating the layers utilizing convention techniques, e.g., filtration, centrifugation, etc.. The aqueous layer is decolorized with activated charcoal (about 1:0.1 w/v, fluconazole activated charcoal). Citric acid (about 1:0.005 w/v, fluconazolexitric acid), acetone (about 1:0.2-0.7 w/v, fluconazole:acetone), ethyl acetate (about 1:0.2-0.7 w/v, fluconazole: ethyl acetate), and methanol (about 1:0.1 w/v, fluconazole :methanol) are then added to the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer is then heated to a temperature in the range of from about 50°C to about 55°C. The pH of the mixture is adjusted to be within a range of from about 5.8 to about 8, and preferably from about 6.8 to about 7.0. The adjustment of the pH may be performed by slow addition of about 15% base such as ammonia at a temperature in the range of from about 20°C to about 60°C, and preferably at a temperature of about 50°C to about 55°C. The mixture should be held at this temperature for a time period of approximately 30 minutes. The mixture is then cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 20°C to about 30°C, and then further cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 5°C to about 10°C. The resulting solid can then be filtered. The filtered solid, e.g., a cake, can be washed with water (about 1:0.25 w/v, fluconazole:water). The product can be dried at a temperature of about 65°C to about 70°C under vacuum until the moisture content is less than about 0.5%.<br>

By performing the purification process of the present invention, highly purified fluconazole can be prepared with a degree of purity greater than about 95%, preferably greater than about 97% and most preferably greater than about 99.5%. Also, the impurities in the final product can be reduced by about 70% to about 95% as compared to the crude product. The crude fluconazole purity as determined by HPLC varies in the range of from about 92% to about 94%. After the crude fluconazole is subjected to the first leaching, the known impurities A, B, C, D, and E, as well as unknown impurities were reduced in the range of from about 2.5 times to about 110 times. The first leaching results in the purity of fluconazole of from about 98% to about 99%. After the second leaching, impurity A was reduced from about 0.2% to about 0.1%; impurity B was reduced from about 0.06% to about 0.03%; impurity C was reduced from about 0.3% to about 0.07%. During acid/base treatment, all the major impurities which were greater than about 0.1 % were reduced to a level of less than about 0.05%.<br>
According to another aspect, the present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the highly purified fluconazole disclosed herein and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Such pharmaceutical compositions may be administered to a mammalian patient in a dosage form.<br>
The dosage forms may contain substantially pure fluconazole or, alternatively, may contain substantially pure fluconazole as part of a composition.

EXAMPLE 1 Purification of Fluconazole: Step I: First Leaching of Crude Fluconazole:<br>
In a 2L 4-necked round bottom flask, crude fluconazole (181g; purity of about 93%), demineralized water (DM water)(905ml), acetone (81.5ml), and ethyl acetate (63.5ml) were added at a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 35°C under stirring.   The<br>
11<br><br>
reaction mixture was then heated to a temperature in the range of from about 55°C to about 60°C and maintained for about 60 minutes. Cold water was circulated to the condenser. Next, the reaction mixture was brought to a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 35°C in about 60 minutes. This was followed by cooling to a temperature in the range of from about 5°C to about 10°C and maintained for about 60 minutes. The precipitated solid was filtered and washed with chilled demineralized water (36ml). The wet cake weighs about 208g, with a purity of about 98.96%.<br>
Step II: Second Leaching of Fluconazole:<br>
Into a 2L 4-necked round bottom flask, the wet fluconazole product obtained from step I (~208g; purity of about 98% to about 99%), together with demineralized water (905ml), acetone (81.5ml), and ethyl acetate (63.5ml) were added at a temperature in the range of from about 30°C to about 35°C under stirring. The reaction mixture was heated to a temperature in the range of from about 55°C to about 60°C and maintained for about 60 minutes. Cold water was circulated to the condenser. Next, the reaction mixture was brought to a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 35°C in about 60 minutes. This was followed by cooling to a temperature in the range of from about 5°C to about 10°C and maintained for about 60 minutes. The precipitated solid was filtered and washed with chilled demineralized water (36ml). The wet cake weighs about 184g, with a purity of about 99.45%.<br>
Step III: Acid/Base Treatment of Fluconazole:<br>
Into a 2L 4-necked round bottom flask, the fluconazole product obtained from step II (~184g; purity of about 99.45%), together with demineralized water (543ml), and concentrated hydrochloric acid (108ml) were added under stirring at a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 35°C. The reaction mixture was maintained under stirring for about 30 minutes. Toluene (about 100ml) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for about 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was then allowed to settle without stirring for about 30 minutes, which allows the layers to separate. The aqueous layer was extracted three times with toluene (100ml x 3). All organic layer washings were clubbed and kept aside for solvent recovery. The aqueous layer was decolorized with activated charcoal (18g) at a temperature in the range of from about 55°C to about 60°C for about 60 minutes.   The carbon treated aqueous layer was filtered through a<br>
12<br><br>
Hyflow bed. The Hyflow bed was washed twice with demineralized water (45ml x 2). Again the washings were clubbed. The aqueous layer was charged into 2L 4-necked flask. Citric acid (lg), acetone (81.5ml), ethyl acetate (81.5ml), and methanol (18.1ml) were added, and the mixture was heated to a temperature in the range of from about 50°C to about 55°C. The pH of the reaction mixture was adjusted to be in the range of from about 6.8 to about 7.0 by slow addition of 15% liquor ammonia (128ml) over about 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was maintained for about 30 minutes at a temperature in the range of from about 50°C to about 55°C. The reaction mixture was then cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 25°C to about 35°C for about 30 minutes. The reaction mixture was further cooled to a temperature in the range of from about 5°C to about 10°C for about 30 minutes. The precipitated product was filtered and washed twice with chilled demineralized water (45ml x 2). The product was dried in a vacuum oven at a temperature in the range of from about 65 °C to about 70°C until the moisture content was less than about 0.5%. The dried product is the pure fluconazole weighing about 154g, with a yield of about 85% and purity greater than about 99.5%. All the individual impurities were below about 0.05%.<br>
