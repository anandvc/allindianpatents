				<td>Description<br>
Transversal filter with improved trap characteristic<br>
The subject matter of the invention is a surface wave transversal filter as used, in particular, as an intermediate frequency filter or precise-frequency transmission filter in consumer electronics.<br>
Surface wave transversal filters, also called SAW transversal filters or just transversal filters below for short, are known, by way of example, from "SAW Components, Data Book 1996" from Siemens Matsushita Components and, loc. cit., in the section "General technical information" on pages 27 ff. These transversal filters are constructed on a crystalline piezoelectrical  substrate  and  have  two  interdigital<br>
transducers  which  are  used  as  input  and  output <br>
transducers. The input transducer, to which the signal<br>
to be filtered is applied,  has a weighting which is	<br>
used to shape the transfer function. By contrast, the	<br>
output  transducer  is  short  relative  to  the  input	<br>
transducer and is unweighted,  and thus has the same<br>
overlap lengths for all the electrode fingers on the	<br>
interdigital    transducer.    Such    an    unweighted	<br>
interdigital transducer has a transfer function       <br><br>
The exact form of the weighting of the input transducer is the result of optimization performed using inherently known suitable software tools. If the result of such optimization, that is to say a filter optimized by means of software, has a characteristic measured in real terms which does not match the desired characteristic, then various methods for measurement correction are known. Essentially, this is achieved by varying the overlap length of the electrode fingers in the input transducer. In a number of cases, however,<br>
such   measurement correction does not result in the<br>
1 desired  success  following  software  optimization.. In<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
particular, such non-optimum filters can have a transfer response which shows an attenuation response for particular frequencies which is nothing more than unsatisfactory. By way of example, such a transfer curve can have too little selection with respect to an adjacent channel or with respect to an interfering frequency, for example the mirror or image frequency. If said conventional measurement corrections are not enough to produce the desired transfer characteristic, then redesign is necessary, that is to say reoptimization with altered constraints, which is complex to implement and also does not necessarily result in an improved transfer characteristic and, in particular, an improved trap characteristic (= filtering a particular frequency).<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to specify a transversal  filter with an improved trap characteristic which can be used to improve a software-optimized design in terms of the brap characteristic J quickly and efficiently.<br>
The invention achieves this object by means of a transversal filter having the features of Claim 1. Advantageous refinements of the invention are specified in the subclaims.<br>
The invention proposes that, for such a known transversal filter, besides the primary weighting of the input transducer, the output transducer also be provided with a weighting which is a secondary weighting and has much less weight than the primary weighting on the input transducer. The invention can be , used to improve the trap characteristic of a transversal filter in accordance with the invention to a significant extent, which is a surprising result in view of the secondary weighting, whose proportion is small. The measurement correction can be made in a short  time,  for  example  within  one  hour,  and  is<br><br>
-3-<br>
therefore much less complex than redesigning the entire transversal filter, which would be necessary without the invention.<br>
The weighting method provided for the secondary weighting is overlap weighting, as for the primary weighting on the input transducer. The extent of the weighting, that is to say the strength of the weighting, is normally given as percentages relative to the aperture of the output transducer and, in accordance with the invention, is no more than 0.5 to 10% thereof. This maximum weighting defined as a length corresponds to the difference between the shortest and the longest overlap length of two adjacent electrode fingers which are tied to different bus bars and therefore have different polarities.<br>
In line with the invention, a novel method for improving the trap characteristic involves the secondary weighting in the output transducer being effected predominantly outside the acoustic track. According to the invention, at least 95% of the weighting of the output transducer can be outside the acoustic track. In this context, the acoustic track is defined as being the surface area between two straight lines placed parallel to the axis of the wave propagation direction, said surface area being limited on the side of the input transducer by the aperture of the input transducer. Accordingly, the output transducer also has a larger aperture than the input transducer. In this case, the difference between the two apertures should be at least 1% and is normally set to no more than 10%.<br>
A transversal filter in accordance with the invention has an input transducer whose length measured in the axis of the wave propagation is at least three times the length of the output transducer. Hence, the improved trap characteristic is attained despite the<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
relatively low secondary weighting and the relatively<br>
short  length  of  the  output  transducer,  which  is  <br>
connected  to  a  correspondingly  smaller  number  of <br>
overlaps.	<br>
The invention is explained in more detail below with reference to an exemplary embodiment and the associated four figures.<br>
Figure 1  shows a known transversal filter<br>
Figure 2  shows an output transducer for a transversal filter in accordance with the invention,<br>
Figure 3  shows  the  transfer  response  of  a  known transversal  filter  in  comparison  with  the<br>
4-<br>
calculated transfer response of a transversal filter in accordance with the invention, and<br>
Figure 4  shows  the  transfer  response  of	a  known<br>
transversal  filter  in  comparison	with  an<br>
inventive   transversal   filter's	transfer<br>
response measured in real terms.<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic illustration (not to scale) of a known transversal filter with an input transducer B and an output transducer A which are arranged on the surface of a piezoelectrical substrate. In the illustration shown, the input transducer is in the form of an overlap-weighted split finger transducer and the output transducer A is in the form of an unweighted normal finger transducer  Wl denotes the envelope for the overlap lengths of adjacent electrode fingers coming from different bus bars, in order to illustrate the weighting shown by way of example. In addition, the output transducer A has a shorter length than the input transducer B.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
During operation of the filter, the input signal is applied to the connections TB1 and TB2, while the output signal can be tapped off on the connections TA1 and TA2.<br>
Figure 2 shows a virtually real illustration of an inventive output transducer Aw which is furnished with a secondary weighting in accordance with the invention.  Such a transducer can be used in one of the transversal  filters shown by way of example in Figure 1 instead of the normal finger transducers A there. Figure 2 clearly shows that the overlap weightings used in the inventive output transducer Aw have just a small weight, and the difference between the smallest and the largest overlap between adjacent electrode fingers Fl, F2, F3. . coming from different  bus  bars  S1,  S2  is  therefore  only slight. The maximum weighting is between 0.5 and 10% in relation to the aperture of the output transducer and,  in one specific case, is 5.43% of the total aperture of the output transducer Aw.<br>
Figure 3 compares the measured transfer response of a<br>
known transversal filter (measurement curve 1, dashed line) having an unweighted output transducer A with the calculated transfer response of a filter in accordance with the invention (measurement curve 2, solid line).  The design optimized using software shows an improved  selection in the model calculation for an indicated trap  frequency  of  41.5 MHz,  the  effect  of  such selection being improved attenuation at said frequency. <br>
Figure 4 in turn compares the transfer response,  measured in real terms, of a known transversal filter with an unweighted output transducer A (measurement curve 1, dashed line) with the transfer response, measured in real terms, of an inventive transversal filter (measurement curve 2, solid line). It can be seen that although the measurement curve 2 for the inventive filter does not quite have the expected outstanding trap characteristic,  the inventive filter<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
is nevertheless furnished with a selection improved by approximately 11 dB at the trap frequency of 41.5 MHz. If the transfer response is otherwise unchanged in the passband, which is significant for the transfer properties and the frequency stability of the filter, the inventive filter is improved overall by said improved trap characteristic.<br>
Besides the 41.5 MHz trap chosen by way of example, the invention naturally also allows optimizations for other individual or else for a plurality of traps in parallel.<br>
It can thus be seen that the inventive secondary weighting in the output transducer of a transversal filter in accordance with the invention allows a better overall transfer response to be attained which allows improved selection to be achieved for trap frequencies, particularly by means of specific and rapidly possible<br>
optimization.<br><br>
