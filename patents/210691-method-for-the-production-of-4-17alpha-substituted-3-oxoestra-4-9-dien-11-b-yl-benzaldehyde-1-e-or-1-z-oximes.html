COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
       [See Section 10]<br>
"METHOD FOR THE PRODUCTION OF 4-(17ALPHA-SUBSTITUTED-3-OXOESTRA-4,9-DIEN-11β-YL)BENZALDEHYDE-[.lE OR lZ]-OXIMES"<br>
SCHERING     AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,      a      German      company      of Mullerstrasse 178, D-13353 Berlin, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANTED<br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
 484/MUMNP/2003<br><br>
22-2-2005<br><br>
A process for the production of 4-(17a-substituted-3-oxoestra-4,9-dien-l 1/3-yl)benzaldehyde-(1E or lZ)-oximes of general formula (I) is provided<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
in which R1 means a hydrogen atom, a C1-6-alkyl radical or a C22F2n+1 radical, R2 means a C1-4-alkyl radical, X means an OH group in E- or Z-position, and Y means an OC1-6 alkyl group, an SC1-6-alkyl group or an OCH2CnF2n+1 group, whereby n is 1,2 or 3.<br>
4-(17a-Substituted-3-oxoestra-4,9-dien-llp-yl)benzaldehyde-(lE or lZ)-oximes are already known. Substances of this type are described in Patent DE 4332283 Al (EP 0 648 778 Bl). Because of the advantageous antigestagenic action and a slight antiglucocorticoidal action, the compounds are of general interest for treating a number of hormone-dependent female diseases, such as, for example, endometriosis.<br><br><br><br>
The existing process for their production preferably uses as a starting material 5a,10a-epoxy-estr-9(l l)-en-17-one (IIa) that is protected as a dimethyl ketal on a C-3 as a ketal,<br><br><br>
and thus allows the production of both selectively a number of various 1 1β-aryl-substituted steroids and different 17a-substituted compounds. In a first step, the 5a,10a-epoxide of formula (Ha) is opened by a Cu(I)-salt-catalyzed Grignard reaction with a 4-brornobenzaldehyde ketal, preferably the 4-bromobenzaldehyde dimethyl ketal, to 1 lJJ-aryl-substituted 5a-hydroxy steroids of formula (Ula)<br><br><br>
In this case, the yields of the process are not optimal since a portion (3 to 10%) of the 17-oxo group is also attacked.<br>
11β,17a-Bisaryl-substituted steroids of formula (IVa)<br><br>
that are very difficult to separate by chromatography from the desired 11β-monoaryl-substituted compounds of formula (IIIa) are produced.<br><br>
According to COREY and CHAYKOWSKY (J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 84, 3782 [1962]), the mixture of the compounds of formulas (IIIa) and (IVa) can be converted mainly into the spiroepoxide of formula (Va)<br><br><br>
 which is opened by alkali methylate to a 17a.-methoxy compound of formula (Via)<br><br><br>
in which R1 is a hydrogen atom and which is converted either immediately or after reaction of 17β-hydroxyl with alkyl halides in the presence of bases such as potassium-tert-butanolate in inert solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or toluene, into the 17B-ethers of formula (VIa), in which R1 is a C1-6-alkyl radical, by acid hydrolysis into the benzaldehydes of formula (VIIa)<br><br><br>
in which R1 is a hydrogen atom or a C1-6-alkyl radical. The 11β, 17β-bisaryl steroids of formula (IVa) that are produced in the Grignard reaction as by-products are constantly entrained under the above-mentioned conditions and ultimately hydrolyzed to the 1 lβ,17a-bisaldehydes of formula (Villa)<br><br>
(VIIIa)<br>
in which R, has the above-indicated meaning. These bisaldehydes of formula (Villa) differ in the crystallization behavior and in their chromatographic properties only very slightly from the monoaldehydes of formula (VIIa) and are difficult to separate largely quantitatively. These by-products pose a problem in the production of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention.<br>
The object of this invention is therefore to make available a more effective and technically simpler process for the production of 4-(17a-substituted-3-oxoestra-4,9-dien-1 lp-yl)benzaldehyde-(lE or lZ)-oximes of general formula (I) that prevents the attack of the Grignard compound on the C-17 and thus produces the compounds of formula (I) with higher yield and purity.<br><br><br>
This object is achieved according to the process of claim 1.<br>
Since the 17-oxo group is converted into the desired 17a-substituted compound before the grignardization, the formation of the by-product of formula (VIIIa) is prevented, by which the target compounds are obtained with higher yield and purity. Thus, for example, using compound (II) as a starting material according to the process of DE 43 32 283 Al, aldehyde (VUb) can be produced at a yield of about 5.6%, and    accordingly oxime (Ic) can be produced at a yield of about 3.8%. By the process according to the invention, the aldehyde (VUb) can now be produced at a yield of about 25% or the oxime (Ic) can be produced at a yield of about 17% from olefin (IX), without special chromatographic conditions having to be used for the purification.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the invention are indicated in the subclaims. Because of additional advantages of the invention, reference is made to the following description and the embodiments.<br>
According to the invention, the 3,3-dimethoxy-5a,10a-epoxy-estr-9(l l)-en-17-ones of formula (ID<br><br>

whereby R2 has the above-indicated meaning, which, after regio- and stereoselective cleavage of the 17-spiroepoxy group by alkali or alkaline-earth alcoholate, preferably by sodium methanolate, by alkylmercaptans in the presence of alkali hydroxides or potassium-tert-butanolate, alternatively directly with alkali mercaptides or with perfluoroalkyl alcohols in the presence of alkali, preferably potassium-tert-butanolate, in solvents, such as methanol, DMF or DMSO, is opened to to the 17oc-substituted compounds of formula (X)<br><br>

in which R3 stands for a methyl radical or an ethylidene group, and R1, R2 and Y have the above-indicated meanings, which are converted by acid hydrolysis of the protective groups, for example with dilute acetic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid in acetone, into the 1 1β-benzaldehyde derivatives of formula (XII),<br><br><br><br>
in which R1, R2 and Y have the above-indicated meanings, and the aldehyde function is converted selectively by hydroxylammonium salts, preferably hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of bases, preferably pyridine or triemylamine, at room temperature into a mixture of the E/Z-benzaldoximes of general formula (I)<br><br>
in which X means an OH group in E- or Z-position, and R1, R2 and Y have the above-indicated meamngs, which are recrystallized or separated by chromatography, purified and isolated as individual components.<br>
In this invention, "alkyl radical" is defined as a branched or straight-chain alkyl radical.
