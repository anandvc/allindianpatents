				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to copolymers based on unsaturated mono- or<br>
dicarboxylic acid derivatives and oxyalkylene glycol alkenyl ethers, to<br>
processes for their preparation and to the use of these copolymers as<br>
additives for aqueous suspensions based on mineral or bituminous binders.<br>
It is known that additives in the form of dispersing agents are often added to<br>
aqueous suspensions of hydraulic binders for improving their processability,<br>
i.e. kneadability, spreadability, sprayability, pumpability or flowability. These<br>
additives, as a rule comprising ionic groups, are able to break up solid<br>
agglomerates, to disperse the particles formed and in this way to improve the<br>
processability, especially of highly concentrated suspensions. This effect is<br>
specifically utilized in the preparation of construction material mixtures, based<br>
on cement, lime and calcium sulphate-based hydraulic binders, if appropriate<br>
also as a mixture with organic (e.g. bituminous) fractions and furthermore for<br>
ceramic compounds, refractory compounds and oilfield construction materials.<br>
In order to convert these construction material mixtures based on the said<br>
binders into a ready-to-use, processable form, as a rule significantly more<br>
mixing water is necessary than would be necessary for the subsequent<br>
hydration or hardening process. The cavity content formed by the excess<br>
water later evaporating in the construction article leads to significantly<br>
worsened mechanical strengths and resistances.<br>
In order to reduce this excess water content in the case of a specified<br>
processing consistency and/or to improve the processability in the case of a<br>
specified water/binder ratio, additives are employed which are in general<br>
designated as water reduction or flow agents. As such agents, poly-<br>
condensation products based on naphthalene- or alkylnaphthalenesulphonic<br>
acids (cf. EP-A 214 412) or melamine-formaldehyde resins comprising<br>
sulphonic acid groups (cf. DE-C 16 71 017) are especially known.<br><br>
A disadvantage with these additives is the fact that their excellent liquefying<br>
action, in particular in concrete construction, only lasts for a short period of<br>
time. The decrease in the processability of concrete mixtures ("slump loss") in<br>
a short time can in particular lead to problems where there is a large period<br>
between preparation and installation of the fresh concrete, for example due to<br>
long conveyor and transport routes.<br>
An additional problem results with the application of such flow agents in<br>
mining and in the interior zone (plasterboard sheet drying, anhydrite flow coat<br>
applications, concrete finished part production), where the release of the toxic<br>
formaldehyde contained in the products due to preparation and thus<br>
considerable industrial hygiene pollution can occur. For this reason, it has<br>
also already been attempted instead of this to develop formaldehyde-free<br>
concrete flow agents from maleic acid monoesters and styrene, for example<br>
according to EP-A 306 449. The flow action of concrete mixtures can be<br>
maintained for an adequately long period of time with the aid of these<br>
additives, but the originally present, very high dispersing action is very rapidly<br>
lost after storage of the aqueous preparation of the flow agent, due to the<br>
hydrolysis of the polymeric ester.<br>
This problem does not occur according to EP-A 373 621 in flow agents<br>
consisting of alkylpolyethylene glycol allyl ethers and maleic anhydride.<br>
However, these products, similarly to those previously described, are surface-<br>
active compounds which introduce undesirably high contents of air pores into<br>
the concrete mixture, from which losses in the strength and resistance of the<br>
hardened construction material result.<br>
For this reason, it is necessary to add to the aqueous solutions of these<br>
polymer compounds antifoams, such as, for example, tributyl phosphate,<br>
silicone derivatives and various water-insoluble alcohols in the concentration<br>
range from 0.1 to 2% by weight based on the solids content. The mixing in of<br>
these components and the maintenance of a storage-stable homogeneous<br><br>
form of the corresponding formulations also itself then turns out to be quite<br>
difficult if these antifoams are added in the form of emulsions.<br>
As a result of the complete or at least partial incorporation of a defoaming or<br>
anti-air-introducing structural unit into the copolymer, the problem of demixing<br>
according to DE 195 13 126 A1 can be solved.<br>
It has been shown, however, that the high effectiveness and the low "slump-<br>
loss" of the copolymers described here often leads to inadequate 24 hour<br>
strengths of the concrete. Such copolymers, in particular, do not have the<br>
optimal properties, where with the lowest possible water content a particularly<br>
densely formed and therefore high-strength and highly resistant concrete<br>
should be produced and steam hardening (finished part industry) for the<br>
acceleration of the hardening process should be dispensed with.<br>
For the solution of this problem, according to DE 199 26 611 A1 copolymers of<br>
unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivatives and oxyalkylene glycol<br>
alkenyl ethers were proposed, which at a low dose can long maintain the<br>
processability of highly concentrated construction material mixtures in<br>
practice, with a simultaneously increased strength in the hardened state of the<br>
construction material due to an extreme lowering of the water/binder ratio.<br>
However, it has proved disadvantageous that the corresponding copolymers<br>
can only be prepared with relatively short polymer chains and a comparatively<br>
low average molecular weight, which is why the dispersing action of these<br>
copolymers was not optimal hitherto.<br>
The present invention was therefore based on the object of making available<br>
novel copolymers which did not have the said disadvantages according to the<br>
prior art, but on account of long polymer chains and high average molecular<br>
weight show an improved dispersing and liquefying action.<br>
This object was achieved according to the invention by the copolymers<br>
according to Claim 1. It has in fact surprisingly been shown that the products<br>
according to the invention based on unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid<br><br>
derivatives and oxyalkylene glycol alkenyl ethers impart a very good<br>
dispersing and liquefying action with, at the same time, excellent processing<br>
properties to aqueous binder suspensions. Moreover, the oxyalkylene glycol<br>
alkenyl ethers employed according to the invention are industrially relatively<br>
simple and inexpensive to prepare and need comparatively low initiator<br>
concentrations in copolymerization, which was likewise unforeseeable.<br>
The copolymers according to the present invention contain at least two,<br>
preferably three, structural groups a), b) and optionally c) and optionally d)<br>
and no other structural groups. The first structural group a) is a mono- or<br>
dicarboxylic acid derivative having the general formulae (la) and/or (lb).<br><br>
In the mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivative (la), R1 represents hydrogen or an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 20 C atoms, preferably a methyl<br>
group. X is H, -COOMa, -CO-O-(CmH2mO)n-R2 or -CO-NH-(CmH2mO)n-R2 with<br>
the following meaning for M, a, m, n and R2:<br>
M is hydrogen, a mono- or divalent metal cation (preferably a sodium,<br>
potassium, calcium or magnesium ion), ammonium, an organic amine radical,<br>
and a = ½ or 1, depending on whether M is a mono- or divalent cation. The<br>
organic amine radicals employed are preferably substituted ammonium groups<br>
which are derived from primary, secondary or tertiary C1-20-alkylamines, C1-20-<br>
alkanolamines, C5-8-cycloalkylamines and C8-14-arylamines. Examples of the<br>
corresponding amines are methylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine,<br>
ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, methyldiethanolamine,<br>
cyclohexylamine, dicyclohexylamine, phenylamine, diphenylamine in the<br>
protonated (ammonium) form.<br><br>
R2 is hydrogen, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 20 C atoms, a<br>
cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 5 to 8 C atoms, an aryl radical<br>
having 6 to 14 C atoms, which can optionally be additionally substituted, m = 2<br>
to 4 and n = 0 to 200, preferably 1 to 150. The aliphatic hydrocarbons can in<br>
this case be linear or branched and saturated or unsaturated. Preferred<br>
cycloalkyl radicals are to be regarded as cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl radicals,<br>
preferred aryl radicals as phenyl or naphthyl radicals, which in particular can<br>
additionally be substituted by hydroxyl, carboxyl or sulphonic acid groups.<br>
Instead of or in addition to the mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivative according<br>
to formula (la), the structural group a) can also be present in cyclic form<br>
according to formula (lb), where Y can be = O (acid anhydride) or NR2 (acid<br>
imide) with the meaning designated above for R2.<br>
The second structural group b) corresponds to formula (II)<br><br>
where R3 = H, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms, R4 = an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms, a cycloaliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon radical having 5 to 8 C atoms and phenyl, R5 = H, an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 5 C atoms, R6, R7 independently from each<br>
other = H, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms, p = 0 to 3, q<br>
+ r = 0 to 500 and R2 has the abovementioned meaning.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, p in formula (II) can be 0; i.e. vinyl<br>
polyalkoxylates are concerned.<br><br>
The third structural group c) corresponds to the formulae (IlIa) or (IIIb)<br><br>
In formula (Ilia), R8 can be = H or CH3, depending on whether acrylic or<br>
methacrylic acid derivatives are concerned. Q can in this case be -H, -COOM a,<br>
or -COOR9, where a and M have the abovementioned meaning and R9 can be *<br>
an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 3 to 20 C atoms, a cycloaliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon radical having 5 to 8 C atoms or an aryl radical having 6 to 14 C<br>
atoms. The aliphatic hydrocarbon radical can likewise be linear or branched,<br>
saturated or unsaturated. The preferred cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radicals<br>
are in turn cyclopentyl or cyclohexyl radicals and the preferred aryl radicals<br>
phenyl or naphthyl radicals. If T = -COOR9, Q = -COOaM or -COOR9. In the<br>
case where T and Q = -COOR9, the corresponding structural groups are<br>
derived from the dicarboxylic acid esters.<br>
In addition to these ester structural units, the structural groups c) can have still<br>
other hydrophobic structural elements. These include the polypropylene oxide<br>
and polypropylene oxide-polyethylene oxide derivatives with<br><br>
x in this case assumes a value from 1 to 150 and y from 0 to 15. The alkylene<br>
oxide derivatives can in this case be linked via a group U1 to the alkyl radical<br>
of the structural group c) according to formula (IlIa), where U1 can be =<br>
-CO-NH-, -O- or -CH2-O-. In this case, the corresponding amide, vinyl or allyl<br><br>
ethers of the structural group according to formula (IlIa) are concerned. R10<br>
can in this case in turn be R2 (for meaning of R2 see above) or<br><br>
where U2 can be = -NH-CO-, -O-, or -OCH2- and Q has the meaning described<br>
above. These compounds are polyalkylene oxide derivatives of the<br>
bifunctional alkenyl compounds according to formula (IlIa).<br>
As further hydrophobic structural elements, the structural groups c) can<br>
additionally contain compounds according to the formula (IlIa) having<br>
T = (CH2)2-V-(CH2)2-CH=CH-R2, where z = 0 to 4 and V can be an<br>
-O-CO-C6H4-CO-O-radical and R2 has the meaning indicated above. In this<br>
case, the corresponding difunctional ethylene compounds according to the<br>
formula (IlIa) are concerned, which are linked to one another via ester groups<br>
of the formula -O-CO-C6H4-CO-O- and where only one ethylene group has<br>
been copolymerized. These compounds are derived from the corresponding<br>
dialkenylphenyldicarboxylic acid esters.<br>
It is also possible in the context of the present invention that not only one, but<br>
both ethylene groups of the difunctional ethylene compounds have been<br>
copolymerized. This corresponds essentially to the structural groups<br>
according to the formula (IIlb)<br><br>
where R2, V and z have the meaning already described.<br><br>
It is to be regarded as essential to the invention that the copolymers contain<br>
10 to 90 mol% of structural groups of the formulae (la) and/or (lb), 1 to 89<br>
mol% of structural groups of the formula (II), 0 to 10 mol% of structural groups<br>
of the formulae (IlIa) and/or (IIIb).<br>
Preferably, these polymers contain 40 to 75 mol% of structural groups of the<br>
formulae (la) and/or (lb), 20 to 55 mol% of structural groups of the formula (II),<br>
1 to 5 mol% of structural groups of the formulae (IlIa) and/or (lllb).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the copolymers according to the<br>
invention additionally contain up to 50 mol%, in particular up to 20 mol%<br>
based on the sum of the structural groups a) to c), of structures which are<br>
based on monomers based on vinyl- or (meth)acrylic acid derivatives such as<br>
styrene, α-methylstyrene, vinyl acetate, vinyl propionate, ethylene, propylene,<br>
isobutene, N-vinylpyrrolidone, allylsulphonic acid, methallylsulphonic acid,<br>
vinylsulphonic acid or vinylphosphonic acid.<br>
Preferred monomeric (meth)acrylic acid derivatives are hydroxyalkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, acrylamide, methacrylamide, AMPS, methyl methacrylate,<br>
methyl acrylate, butyl acrylate or cyclohexyl acrylate.<br>
The number of repeating structural units in the copolymers is not restricted. It<br>
has proved particularly advantageous, however, to set average molecular<br>
weights of 5000 to 100 000 g/mol.<br>
The preparation of the copolymers according to the invention can be carried<br>
out in various ways. It is important in this case that 10 to 90 mol% of an<br>
unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivative, 1 to 89 mol% of an<br>
oxyalkylene alkenyl ether and 0 to 10 mol% of a vinylic polyalkylene glycol or<br>
ester compound are polymerized with the aid of a free-radical starter.<br><br>
Unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivatives which form the structural<br>
groups of the formulae (la) and (lb) preferably employed are: acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid, maleic acid or fumaric acid.<br>
Instead of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid or fumaric acid, their<br>
mono- or divalent metal salts, preferably sodium, potassium, calcium or<br>
ammonium salts, can also be used.<br>
As the acrylic, methacrylic, maleic acid or fumaric acid, derivatives are<br>
especially used esters thereof with a polyalkylene glycol of the general<br>
formula HO-(CmH2mO)n-R2 having R2 = H, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical<br>
having 1 to 20 C atoms, a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 5 to 8 C<br>
atoms, an optionally substituted aryl radical having 6 to 14 C atoms and m = 2<br>
to 4 and n = 0 to 200.<br>
The preferred substituents on the aryl radical are -OH, -COOe or -SO3e<br>
groups.<br>
Instead of maleic acid, its anhydride or imide can also be used. The<br>
derivatives of the formulae (la) and (lb) can also be present as a mixture of<br>
anhydride or imide and free acid and are used in an amount of preferably 40<br>
to 75 mol%.<br>
The second component essential to the invention for the preparation of the<br>
copolymers according to the invention is an oxyalkylene glycol alkenyl ether,<br>
which is preferably employed in an amount from 20 to 55 mol%. In the<br>
preferred oxyalkylene glycol alkenyl ethers according to the formula (V)<br><br><br>
R3 = H or is an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms, R4 is an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms, a cycloaliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon radical having 5 to 8 C atoms and phenyl, R5 = H, an aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 5 C atoms, R6 and R7 independently from<br>
each other = H, an aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 1 to 6 C atoms, p = 0<br>
to 3, q + r = 0 to 500, while R2 has the abovementioned meaning. In this case,<br>
the use of propenyloxy-polyalkylene glycol derivatives, which can be prepared<br>
very simply by rearrangement of the corresponding allyl polyethers, has<br>
proved particularly advantageous.<br>
1 to 5 mol% of a vinylic polyalkylene glycol or ester compound are preferably<br>
employed as the third optional component for the introduction of the structural<br>
group c). The most preferred vinylic polyalkylene glycol compounds used are<br>
derivatives according to the formula (VI),<br><br>
where Q can preferably be -H, or -COO,MR8 = H, CH3 and U1 = -CO-NH-, -O-<br>
or -CH2O-, i.e. the acid amide, vinyl or allyl ether of the corresponding<br>
polyalkylene glycol derivatives is concerned. The values for x are 1 to 150 and<br>
for y = 0 to 15. R10 can either again be R2 or<br><br>
where U2 = -NH-CO-, -O- and -OCH2- and Q = -COOaM and is preferably -H.<br><br>
If R10 = R2 and R2 is preferably H, the polyalkylene glycol monoamides or<br>
ethers of the corresponding acrylic (Q = H, R8 = H), methacrylic (Q = H, R8 =<br>
CH3) or maleic acid (Q = -COO M-R8 = H) derivatives are concerned.<br>
Examples of such monomers are maleic acid N-(methylpolypropylene glycol)<br>
monoamide, maleic acid N-(methoxypolypropylene glycol polyethylene glycol)<br>
monoamide, polypropylene glycol vinyl ether and polypropylene glycol allyl<br>
ether.<br>
If R10 = R2, Afunctional vinyl compounds are concerned whose polyalkylene<br>
glycol derivatives are bonded to one another by means of amide or ether<br>
groups (-O- or -OCH2-). Examples of such compounds are polypropylene<br>
glycol bismaleic amide acid, polypropylene glycol diacrylamide, polypropylene<br>
glycol dimethacrylamide, polypropylene glycol divinyl ether, polypropylene<br>
glycol diallyl ether.<br>
The vinyl ester compound employed in the context of the present invention is<br>
preferably derivatives according to the formula (VII),<br><br>
where Q = -COO M or-COOR9 and R9 can be an aliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
radical having 3 to 20 C atoms, a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon radical having 5<br>
to 8 C atoms and an aryl radical having 6 to 14 C atoms; a and M have the<br>
above-mentioned meaning. Examples of such ester compounds are di-n-butyl<br>
maleate or fumarate or mono-n-butyl maleate or fumarate.<br>
In addition, compounds according to the formula (VIII) can also be employed<br><br><br>
where z in turn can be 0 to 4 and R2 has the already known meaning. V is in<br>
this case -O-CO-C6H4-CO-O-. These compounds are, for example,<br>
dialkenylphthalic acid derivatives. A typical example of such phthalic acid<br>
derivatives is diallyl phthalate.<br>
The molecular weights of the compounds which form the structural group c)<br>
can be varied within wide limits and are preferably between 150 and 10 000.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible according to a preferred embodiment<br>
for additionally up to 50, preferably up to 20, mol%, based on the sum of the<br>
structural groups a) to c), of further monomers as described above to be<br>
employed.<br>
The copolymers according to the present invention can be prepared by the<br>
customary methods. A particular advantage according to the invention<br>
consists in the fact that it is possible to work without solvent or else in<br>
aqueous solution. In both cases, reactions which are pressureless and<br>
therefore quite safe in terms of safety are concerned.<br>
If the process is carried out in aqueous solution, the polymerization takes<br>
place at 20 to 100°C with the aid of a customary free-radical starter, the<br>
concentration of the aqueous solution preferably being adjusted to 30 to 50%<br>
by weight. According to a preferred embodiment, the free-radical<br>
polymerization can in this case be carried out in the acidic pH range, in<br>
particular at a pH between 4.0 and 6.5, where use can be made of the<br>
conventional initiators such as H2O2 without a feared ether cleavage occurring,<br>
by means of which the yields would be very severely reduced.<br><br>
In the process according to the invention, a procedure is preferably used such<br>
that the unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid derivative which forms the<br>
structural group a) is introduced in partly neutralized form in aqueous solution,<br>
preferably together with the polymerization initiator, and the other monomers<br>
are metered in as soon as the necessary reaction temperature is reached in<br>
the receiver. The polymerization auxiliaries, which can lower the activation<br>
threshold of the preferably peroxidic initiator, are added separately such that<br>
the copolymerization can proceed at relatively low temperatures. According to<br>
a further preferred embodiment, the unsaturated mono- or dicarboxylic acid<br>
derivative and also the free-radical former can be metered in at separate or<br>
common inlets of the reactor receiver, by means of which the problem of heat<br>
dissipation can be solved in an ideal manner.<br>
On the other hand, it is also possible to introduce the polyalkylene glycol<br>
alkenyl ether forming the structural group b) and to meter in the mono- or<br>
dicarboxylic acid derivative (structural group a)) such that a uniform<br>
distribution of the monomer units over the polymer chain is achieved.<br>
The type of polymerization initiators, activators and other auxiliaries used,<br>
such as, for example, molecular weight regulators, is relatively<br>
unproblematical, i.e. the initiators used are the customary free-radical donors,<br>
such as hydrogen peroxide, sodium, potassium or ammonium<br>
peroxodisulphate, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, dibenzoyl peroxide, sodium<br>
peroxide, 2,2'-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride,<br>
azobis(isobutyronitrile) etc. If redox systems are used, the abovementioned<br>
initiators are combined with activators having a reducing action. Examples of<br>
such reducing agents are Fe(ll) salts, sodium hydroxymethanesulphinate<br>
dihydrate, alkali metal sulphites and metabisulphites, sodium hypophosphite,<br>
hydroxylamine hydrochloride, thiourea etc.<br>
A particular advantage of the copolymers according to the invention is the fact<br>
that they can also be prepared without solvent, which can take place with the<br>
aid of the customary free-radical starters at temperatures between 20 and<br><br>
150°C. For economical reasons, this variant can in particular be used when<br>
the copolymers according to the invention are to be supplied directly to their<br>
use according to the invention in anhydrous form, because then a laborious<br>
removal of the solvent, in particular of the water (for example by spray drying)<br>
can be omitted.<br>
The copolymers according to the invention are outstandingly suitable as<br>
additives for aqueous suspensions of inorganic and organic solids based on<br>
mineral or bituminous binders such as cement, gypsum, lime, anhydrite or<br>
other calcium sulphate-based construction materials, or based on pulverulent<br>
dispersion binders, where they are employed in an amount from 0.01 to 10%<br>
by weight, in particular 0.1 to 5% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
mineral binder.<br>

or ester compounds are described and also their use as additives for<br>
aqueous suspensions based on mineral or bituminous binders, in particular<br>
cement, gypsum, lime, anhydrite, or other calcium sulphate-based binders,<br>
and based on pulverulent dispersion binders. The copolymers according to<br>
the invention impart to the aqueous binder suspensions a very good<br>
dispersing and liquefying action with, at the same time, simultaneous<br>
excellent processing properties. Moreover, the oxyalkylene glycol alkenyl<br>
ether according to the invention are industrially relatively simple and<br>
inexpensive to prepare and need comparatively low initiator concentrations<br>
in the copolymerization.</td>
