				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to 2-oxoazepan derivative compounds of formula I useful<br>
as antagonists of CGRP receptors for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which the CGRP is involved.<br>
The invention is  also directed to pharmaceutical  compositions  comprising these<br>
compounds and the use of these compounds and compositions in the prevention or treatment of such diseases<br>
in which CGRP is involved.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
CGRP (Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide) is a naturally occurring 37-amino acid peptide that is generated by tissue-specific alternate processing of calcitonin messenger RNA and is widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous system. CGRP is localized predominantly in sensory afferent and central neurons and mediates several biological actions, including vasodilation. CGRP is expressed in alpha- and beta-forms that vary by one and three amino acids in the rat and human, respectively. CGRP-alpha and CGRP-beta display similar biological properties. When released from the cell, CGRP initiates its biological responses by binding to specific cell surface receptors that are predominantly coupled to the activation of adenylyl cyclase. CGRP receptors have been identified and pharmacologically evaluated in several tissues and cells, including those of brain, cardiovascular, endothelial, and smooth muscle origin.<br>
CGRP-mediated vasodilation of rat middle meningeal artery was shown to sensitize neurons of the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Williamson et al., The CGRP Family: Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP), Amylin, and Adrenomedullin, Landes Bioscience, 2000, 245-247). Similarly, distention of dural blood vessels during migraine headache may sensitize trigeminal neurons. Some of the associated symptoms of migraine, including extra-cranial pain and facial allodynia, may be the result of sensitized trigeminal neurons (Burstein et al., Ann. Neurol. 2000, 47, 614-624). A CGRP antagonist may be beneficial in attenuating, preventing or reversing the effects of neuronal sensitization.<br>
The ability of the compounds of the present invention to act as CGRP antagonists makes them useful pharmacological agents for disorders that involve CGRP in humans and animals, but particularly in humans. Such disorders include migraine and cluster headache (Doods, Curr Opin Inves Drugs, 2001, 2 (9), 1261-1268; Edvinsson et al., Cephalalgia, 1994, 14, 320-327); chronic tension type headache (Ashina et al., Neurology, 2000, 14, 1335-1340); pain (Yu et al., Eur. J. Pharm., 1998, 347, 275-282); chronic pain (Hulsebosch et al., Pain, 2000, 86, 163-175); neurogenic inflammation and inflammatory pain (Holzer, Neurosci., 1988, 24, 739-768; Delay-Goyet et al., Acta Physiol. Scanda. 1992, 146, 537-538; Salmon et al., Nature Neurosci., 2001, 4(4), 357-358); eye pain (May et al. Cephalalgia, 2002, 22, 195-196), tooth pain (Awawdeh et al., Int. Endocrin. J., 2002, 35, 30-36), non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Molina et al., Diabetes, 1990, 39, 260-265); vascular disorders; inflammation (Zhang et al., Pain, 2001, 89, 265), arthritis, asthma (Foster et al., Ann. NY Acad. Sci., 1992, 657, 397-404; Schini et al., Am. J. Physiol., 1994, 267, H2483-H2490; Zheng et al., J. Virol., 1993, 67, 5786-5791); shock, sepsis (Beer et al., Crit. Care Med., 2002, 30 (8), 1794-1798); opiate withdrawal<br><br><br><br><br><br>

Neurosci., 1996, 16 (7), 2342-2351); hot flashes in men and women (Chen et al., Lancet, 1993, 342, 49; Spetz et al., J. Urology, 2001, 166, 1720-1723); allergic dermatitis (Wallengren, Contact Dermatitis, 2000, 43 (3), 137-143); encephalitis, brain trauma, ischaemia, stroke, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative diseases (Robrenbeck et al., Neurobiol. of Disease 1999, 6, 15-34); skin diseases (Geppetti and Holzer, Eds., Neurogenic Inflammation, 1996, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL), neurogenic cutaneous redness, skin rosaceousness and erythema. Of particular importance is the acute or prophylactic treatment of headache, including migraine and cluster headache.<br><br>
The present invention relates to compounds that are useful as ligands for CORP receptors, in particular antagonists for CORP receptors, processes for their preparation, their use in therapy, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them and methods of therapy using them.<br><br><br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and individual diastereomers thereof.<br><br><br>
It is to be understood that where one or more of the above recited structures or substructures recite multiple substituents having the same designation each such variable may be the same or different from each similarly designated variable. For example, R2 is recited four times in Formula I, and each R2 in Formula I may independently be any of the substructures defined under R2. The invention is not limited to structures and substructures wherein each R2 must be the same for a given structure. The same is true with respect to any variable appearing multiple time in a structure or substructure.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers; diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the ambit of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br><br>
The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration.<br><br>
If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to<br><br><br>
the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art.<br><br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.<br><br>
As will be appreciated by those of skill in the art, not all of the RIO and R~ substituents are capable of forming a ring structure. Moreover, even those substituents capable of ring formation may or may not form a ring structure.<br><br>

The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as antagonists of CORP receptor activity may be demonstrated by methodology known in the art. Inhibition of the binding of '~l-CGRP to receptors and functional antagonism of CGRP receptors were determined as follows:<br><br>
BINDING ASSAY: The binding of '251-CGRP to receptors in SK-N-MC cell membranes was carried out essentially as described (Edvinsson et at. (2001) Eui-. I. Plzarmacol. 415, 39-44). Briefly, membranes (25 Og) were incubated in I nil of binding buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCI2 and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)] containing 10 pM '251-CGRP and inhibitor. After incubation at room temperature for 3 h, the assay was terminated by filtration through GFB glass fibre filter plates (Millipore) that had been blocked with 0.5% polyethyleneimine for 3 h. The filters were<br>
washed three times with ice-cold assay buffer, then the plates were air dried. Scintillation fluid (50 LII) was added and the radioactivity was counted on a Topcount (Packard Instrument). Data analysis was carried out by using Prism and the K~ was determined by using the Cheng—Prusoff equation (Cheng &amp; Prusoff (1973) Biochem. Pharmacol. 22, 3099-3 108).<br><br>
FUNCTIONAL ASSAY: SK-N-MC cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 units/mi penicillin and 100 Ug/mI streptomycin at 37 0C, 95% humidity, and 5% CO2. For cAIvIP assays, cells were plated at 5 x i0~ cells/well in 96-well poly-Dlysine-coated plates (Becton-Dickinson) and cultured for — 18 h before assay. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, Sigma) then pre-incubated with 300 ElM isobutylmethylxanthine in serum-free MEM for 30 mm at 37 0C. O-CGRP-(8-37) was added and the cells were incubated for 10 ruin before the addition of CORP. The incubation was continued for another 15 ruin, then the cells ~vere washed with PBS and processed for cAMP determination according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Maximal stimulation over basal was defined by using 100 tiM CORP. Dose—response curves were generated by using Prism. Dose-ratios (DR) ~;'ere calculated and used to construct full Schild plots (Arunlakshana &amp; Schild (1959) Br. J. Pharmacol. 14, 48-58).<br><br>
In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity as antagonists of the CORP receptor in the aforementioned assays, generally with a I~ or IC50 value of less than about 50 ElM. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as antagonists of CORP receptors.<br><br>

In addition to the treatment of warm-blooded animals the compounds of the invention are effective for use in humans.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions for the administration of the compounds of this invention may conveniently be presented in dosage unit form and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing the active ingredient into association with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory ingredients. In general, the pharmaceutical compositions are prepared by unifonnly and intimately bringing the active ingredient into association with a liquid carrier or a finely divided solid carrier or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation. In the pharmaceutical composition the active compound is included in an amount sufficient to produce the desired effect upon the process or condition of diseases. As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any producf which results, directly or indirectly, from combination of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract-and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S. Patents 4,256,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265.S74 to form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. Oral tablets may also be formulated for immediate release, such as fast melt tablets or wafers, rapid dissolve tablets or fast dissolve films.<br><br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin, or olive oil.<br><br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or ti-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those -suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of iniectables.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical composition and method of the present invention may further comprise other therapeutically active compounds as noted herein which are usually applied in the treatment of the above mentioned pathological conditions.<br><br>
In the treatment, prevention, control, amelioration, or reduction of risk of conditions which require antagonism of CGRP receptor activity an appropriate dosage level will generally be about 0.01 to 500 rug per kg patient body weight per day which can be administered in single or multiple doses. A suitable dosage level may be about 0.01 to 250 mg/kg per day, about 0.05 to 100 mg/kg per day, or about 0.1 to 50 mg/kg per day. Within this range the dosage may be 0.05 to 0.5, 0.5 to 5 or 5 to 50 mg/kg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are may be provided in the form of tablets containing 1.0 to 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient, particularly 1.0, 5.0, 10.0. 15.0. 20.0, 25.0, 50.0, 75.0,<br><br>
100.0,	150.0, 200.0, 250.0, 300.0, 400.0, 500.0. 600.0, 750.0, 800.0, 900.0, and 1000.0 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated. The compounds may be administered on a regimen of I to 4 times per day, or may be administered once or twice per day.<br><br>
When treating, preventing, controlling, ameliorating, or reducing the risk of headache, migraine, cluster headache, or other diseases for which compounds of the present invention are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.1 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal body weight, given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. For most large mammals, the total daily dosage is from about 1.0 milligrams to about 1000 milligrams, or from about 1 milligrams to about 50 milligrams. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 7 milligrams to about 350 milligrams. This dosage regimen may be adjusted to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br><br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing therapy.<br><br>
Several methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are illustrated in the following Schemes and Examples. Starting materials are made according to procedures known in the art or as illustrated herein.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared readily according to the following Schemes and specific examples, or modifications thereof, using readily available starting materials, reagents and conventional synthesis procedures. In these reactions, it is also possible to make use of variants which are themselves known to those of ordinary skill in this art but are not mentioned in greater detail. The general procedures for making the compounds claimed in this invention can be readily understood and appreciated by one skilled in the art from viewing the following Schemes.<br>
The synthesis of caprolactam azabetizimidazolone intermediates may be conducted as described in Schemes 1-6.<br><br>
The preparation of final compounds proceeds through intermediates such as those of Formula I and Formula H, and the synthesis of each intermediate is described herein.<br><br><br>
REACTION SCHEMES<br><br><br>
The preparation of final compounds proceeds through intermediates such as those of Formula III and Formula TV, and the synthesis of each intermediate is described herein.<br>
In general, intennediates of the Formulae m and TV can be coupled through a urea linkage as shown in Scheme 1. Amine intermediate 1 can be converted to a reactive carbamate, for example p-nitrophenylcarbamate 2, which is subsequently reacted with an amine like that of intermediate 3 to produce urea 4. Other activated intermediates known to those skilled in the art can be used to prepare compounds like 4. For example, amine 1 can be directly acylated with the appropriate carbamoyl chloride.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The synthesis of compounds represented by Intermediate II can be accomplished by procedures similar to those described in Henning et al., J. Med. Chem., 1987, 30, 8 14-819; Carpino et al., WO 96/35713; Brown et al., J. Chem. Soc. 1957. 682-686; Barlin et al., Aust. J. Chem. 1982, 35 (11),<br>
2299-2306; and references Cited tberein. --	-<br><br>
Additionally, the synthesis of compounds represented by Intermediate II can be accomplished according to Scheme 2. For example, a diamino heterocycle, such as 2,3-diaminopyridine 5, can be reductively alkylated with ketones such as 6 to give the monalkylated product 7. Ring closure with carbonyldiimidazole furnishes imidazolone 8. Final deprotection under standard conditions gives the final product 9.<br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Caprolactams can be assembled following an olefin metathesis strategy as outlined in Scheme 3. 2,4-Dimethoxybenzylamine hydrochloride is alkylated with 2,3-dibromopropene under mild basic conditions to give amine 11. (2R)-2-{[(benzyloxy)ciarbonyl]amino}pent-enoic acid 12, prepared in one step from commercially available D-allyl glycine according to known procedures (J. Chem. Soc., 1962, 3963-3968), can be coupled to amine 11 under a variety of conditions to give amide 13. A variety of transition metal catalyzed cross couplings can be performed on the vinyl bromide, for example palladium-mediated arylations with phenylboronic acid and sodium carbonate, yielding styrene derivative 14. Ring-closing metathesis occurs in the presence of the Grubbs second generation ruthenium catalyst in dichloromethane with mild heating to afford lactam 15. Removal of the dimethoxybenzyl group and hydrogenation with in situ protection of the primary amine gives the corresponding saturated lactam 17. After selective alkylation of the arnide nitrogen with various electrophiles such as alkyl bromides, deprotection under acidic conditions (Figure Removed) <br>
Variation at the 6-position of the caprolactams can be introduced by employing a similar strategy (Scheme 4). Ring-closing metathesis can be performed directly on vinyl bromide 13 using the Grubbs second generation ruthenium catalyst to give cyclic vinyl bromide 20. Removal of the dimethoxybetizyl group and palladium-mediated cross coupling, in this case with a boronic acid, furnishes compounds of the general formula 22. The transformation of 21 to 22 is not limited to boronic acid derivatives. After standard hydrogenation, the amide nitrogen can be selectively alkylated with various electrophiles, for example alkyl bromides, using sodium hydride as base. Deprotection yields lactams of the general formula 25. <br>

In some cases the final product may be further modified, for example, by manipulation of substituents. These manipulations may include, but are not limited to, reduction, oxidation, alkylation, acylation, and hydrolysis reactions which are commonly known to those skilled in the art. <br>
