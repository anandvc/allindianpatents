				<td>Apparatus and method for optical analysis of value documents<br>
[001] The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for optical analysis<br>
of value documents.<br>
[002] Value documents are understood here to be card- or in particular sheet-<br>
shaped objects that represent for example a monetary value or an authoriza-<br>
tion and/or are not to be producible at will by unauthorized persons. They<br>
therefore have features that are not easy to produce, in particular to copy,<br>
whose presence is an indication of authenticity, i.e. production by an autho-<br>
rized body. Important examples of such value documents are chip cards,<br>
coupons, vouchers, checks and in particular bank notes.<br>
[003] Value documents are often analyzed optically for recognition of their type<br>
and/or their state and/or for a check of authenticity. It is fundamentally possi-<br>
ble to use ambient light for the analysis, but such analyses show excessive<br>
errors due to fluctuations in the properties of the ambient light.<br>
[004] Analysis is therefore done using apparatuses that possess an illumination de-<br>
vice for illuminating with optical radiation of given properties at least a part<br>
of a value document portion determined by a recording area of the apparatus,<br>
and a detection device for detecting optical radiation coming from the<br>
recording area, in particular a value document illuminated by the illumina-<br>
tion device.<br>
[005] Although it is possible to use light sources such as halogen lamps for illumi-<br>
nation, they consume a lot of power compared with the radiated power emit-<br>
ted in a desired spectral range and therefore require adequate cooling. They<br>
further have the disadvantage of not having a very long life. Furthermore,<br>
such light sources have considerable space requirements.<br>
[006] The present invention is therefore based on the problem of providing an ap-<br>
paratus for optical analysis of value documents that permits good illumina-<br>
tion of a value document to be analyzed while having a compact structure, as<br>
well as of specifying a corresponding method.<br><br>
[007] This problem is solved by an apparatus for optical analysis of at least one<br>
value document in a recording area of the apparatus, having an illumination<br>
device for illuminating the value document in at least a part of the recording<br>
area and possessing at least one surface emitting laser diode, and a control<br>
device for driving the laser diode, and a detection device for recording opti-<br>
cal radiation from at least a part of the recording area.<br>
[008] The problem is further solved by a method for optical analysis of a value<br>
document in a recording area wherein the value document is illuminated with<br>
at least one surface emitting laser diode.<br>
[009] In the method it is possible to preferably record optical radiation from at<br>
least a part of the recording area that occurs through the illumination of the<br>
value document. This can be in particular luminescence radiation excited in<br>
the value document, optical radiation reflected by the value document or<br>
transmitted therethrough.<br>
[0010] The detection device can accordingly be disposed relative to the illumination<br>
device and the recording area in particular in such a way that its radiation en-<br>
try is located on the same side of the value document where it is illuminated,<br>
or on the opposite side. This means that the detection device can be so dis-<br>
posed that analysis is possible with incident or transmitted light or in reflec-<br>
tion or transmission.<br>
[0011] The analysis can fundamentally be done when the value document is at rest<br>
relative to the analysis apparatus and in particular to the illumination device.<br>
However, in particular upon use in a value document processing apparatus in<br>
which value documents are analyzed automatically in succession, the value<br>
document can also be moving during illumination. The subject matter of the<br>
invention is therefore also an apparatus for processing value documents,<br>
hereinafter also referred to as a value document processing apparatus, having<br>
an inventive analysis apparatus and a transport device for moving a value<br>
document through the recording area at a given transport speed. The trans-<br>
port speed can be given in particular in dependence on properties of the anal-<br><br>
ysis apparatus or of the transport device. Upon sequential detection it is thus<br>
possible to obtain an image of the value document portion moving through<br>
the recording area.<br>
[0012] The invention departs completely from the conventional manners of illumi-<br>
nation. Although it is possible to use conventional edge emitting laser diodes<br>
instead of halogen lamps for illumination, they radiate optical radiation with<br>
a very inhomogeneous and not simply symmetric intensity distribution. This<br>
can impair the analysis of the value document.<br>
[0013] According to the invention, a surface emitting laser diode is used for illumi-<br>
nation. A surface emitting laser diode is understood in the context of the<br>
present invention more precisely to be a vertical surface emitting laser diode<br>
or in particular a semiconductor device also referred to in English as a "verti-<br>
cal cavity surface emitting laser" (VCSEL), whose laser resonator is aligned<br>
with its output direction, in which radiation is to be coupled out of the laser<br>
resonator, at least approximately perpendicular to the surface of the device or<br>
chip. In particular, the laser resonator of such surface emitting laser diodes<br>
can have reflection devices, for example reflecting layers or reflecting layer<br>
systems, extending at least approximately parallel to the surface.<br>
[0014] Surprisingly, the use of such surface emitting laser diodes offers not one but<br>
several advantages for use in an apparatus for analyzing value documents,<br>
also referred to hereinafter as an analysis apparatus.<br>
[0015] Further, they can be produced with large exit windows compared with edge<br>
emitting laser diodes, so that the radiated beam is not, or hardly, influenced<br>
by diffraction on the edges.<br>
[0016] Furthermore, surface emitting laser diodes have a beam profile that is rota-<br>
tionally symmetric in good approximation, which substantially facilitates a<br>
beam shaping with simple optical elements compared to edge emitting laser<br>
diodes.<br><br>
[0017] Further, in surface emitting laser diodes the emission wavelength range is<br>
determined more strongly by the laser resonator than in edge emitting laser<br>
diodes. This allows narrower emission wavelength ranges and leads to higher<br>
thermal stability of the emission wavelength range.<br>
[0018] The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission spectrum is<br>
preferably less than 1 nm.<br>
[0019] Also, the spatial coherence of the emitted radiation is lower than in edge<br>
emitting laser diodes, so that speckle patterns can be largely or completely<br>
avoided on a value document illuminated with the laser diode.<br>
[0020] Due to the favorable beam shape of the surface emitting laser diodes, they<br>
can be advantageously combined with each other for illumination purposes,<br>
so that besides the laser diode at least one further surface emitting laser<br>
diode is used for illumination in the method. It is therefore preferred in the<br>
analysis apparatus that the illumination device possesses at least one further<br>
surface emitting laser diode for producing a given illumination pattern in the<br>
recording area, and the control device is configured to drive the further laser<br>
diode.<br>
[0021] In this case it is particularly preferable that the laser diodes are configured in<br>
a component or chip. Such a configuration is readily possible only with sur-<br>
face emitting laser diodes and has the advantage that it is easy to produce a<br>
large array of laser diodes. A further advantage is that only one component<br>
needs to be handled as the radiation source upon assembly of the analysis ap-<br>
paratus, which substantially simplifies production.<br>
[0022] Particularly preferably, more than 50 laser diodes are disposed on a compo-<br>
nent.<br>
[0023] The drive of the laser diodes by means of the control device can be effected<br>
in different ways. In the simplest variant, all laser diodes of the illumination<br>
device are driven jointly, so that the illumination pattern obtained in the<br><br>
recording area is determined substantially by the number and arrangement of<br>
the laser diodes.<br>
[0024] According to another embodiment, the illumination device has at least two<br>
groups of surface emitting laser diodes which comprise the above-mentioned<br>
surface emitting laser diodes, and the laser diodes of one group are drivable<br>
independently of those of the other group. The control device is configured<br>
to drive one group of laser diodes separately from the drive of the other<br>
groups of laser diodes. In the method the value document can then be illumi-<br>
nated with at least two groups of surface emitting laser diodes which contain<br>
the laser diode, the laser diodes of one group being driven separately from<br>
those of the other group. Thus, drive of the groups permits in particular a<br>
temporal and spatial variation of the illumination pattern, which offers the<br>
advantage of greater variability of the illumination. A separate or indepen-<br>
dent drive or drivability is understood here to mean that the laser diodes per-<br>
mit such a drive. Further, the control device must be able to drive the groups<br>
independently of each other, whereby the drive of the two groups of laser<br>
diodes can of course be coupled, for example through a programming of the<br>
control device.<br>
[0025] According to a further embodiment, in the analysis apparatus the laser diodes<br>
are drivable singly and the control device is configured to drive the laser<br>
diodes singly. If further surface emitting laser diodes are used for illuminat-<br>
ing the value document in the method, the laser diodes can then be driven<br>
singly. In particular, the drive can be effected independently or separately in<br>
the above-mentioned sense. The possibility of singly driving laser diodes on<br>
a chip is a further advantage of surface emitting laser diodes.<br>
[0026] The arrangement of the laser diodes and their drive permit the illumination<br>
pattern to be largely determined in its form when only a simple illumination<br>
optic is used, i.e. in particular an illumination optic with optical components,<br>
such as lenses, that are rotationally symmetric at least approximately around<br>
an optical axis, optionally folded by deflecting elements, in the area of the<br><br>
beam path. The use of only such an illumination optic simplifies and cheap-<br>
ens the production of the illumination device.<br>
[0027] An illumination device having a plurality of surface emitting laser diodes<br>
preferably configured in a chip or component can be used advantageously for<br>
producing an areal illumination pattern due to the form of the beam profile<br>
of the laser diodes. For this purpose, the analysis apparatus is preferably con-<br>
figured to illuminate a given area with an illumination pattern whose loca-<br>
tion-dependent intensity variation over the area illuminated by the laser<br>
diodes is smaller than 20% of the maximum intensity of the illumination pat-<br>
tern. In the method the laser diodes can be driven in such a way that the laser<br>
diodes illuminate a given area of the value document with an illumination<br>
pattern whose location-dependent intensity variation over the area is smaller<br>
than 20% of the maximum intensity of the illumination pattern. Such an illu-<br>
mination is particularly homogeneous and thus facilitates a reliable detection<br>
of features. The given area preferably has an extent greater than 0.5 mm2.<br>
[0028] This homogeneity can fundamentally be obtained by using suitable optical<br>
components or homogenization devices in the analysis apparatus. However,<br>
the surface emitting laser diodes are preferably disposed relative to each oth-<br>
er for illuminating a given area with an illumination pattern so that the illu-<br>
mination pattern produced therewith has a location-dependent intensity vari-<br>
ation over the area smaller than 20% of the maximum intensity of the illumi-<br>
nation pattern. This makes it possible to avoid the use of special optical com-<br>
ponents and in particular that of homogenization devices, such as diffusing<br>
disks, diffractive optical elements or light guides, which reduce the intensity<br>
of the emitted optical radiation. The analysis apparatus therefore particularly<br>
preferably has no homogenization elements, such as diffusing disks, light<br>
guides or microlens arrays, for homogenization.<br>
[0029] The center distance between next adjacent surface emitting laser diodes of<br>
the illumination device is for this purpose preferably smaller than 150 um.<br><br>
[0030] According to a first variant, the laser diodes can be disposed in the form of a<br>
matrix in the analysis apparatus. They can be disposed in particular on the<br>
grid points of a rectangular or square grid. This permits a particularly simple<br>
production of a laser diode array on a chip, in particular since in the case of a<br>
single drivability of the laser diodes the corresponding signal connections<br>
can be simply designed. Furthermore, a particularly simple drive can be ef-<br>
fected with this arrangement.<br>
[0031] In a second variant of the analysis apparatus, the laser diodes are disposed on<br>
the points of a hexagonal point grid. This arrangement has the advantage that<br>
a particularly dense arrangement of the laser diodes is obtained in a simple<br>
manner, thereby permitting a particularly homogeneous illumination pattern.<br>
[0032] As stated above, the illumination pattern can be determined in the recording<br>
area or on the value document at least in its form substantially by the ar-<br>
rangement of the radiating laser diodes. In the analysis apparatus the control<br>
device is therefore preferably configured to drive only some of the laser<br>
diodes in each case to emit optical radiation to produce a given illumination<br>
pattern. Accordingly, in the method the laser diodes are preferably driven to<br>
emit optical radiation so that a given illumination pattern is produced. This<br>
embodiment has the advantage that, depending on the configuration, a<br>
change of the illumination pattern requires only a change of the control de-<br>
vice. If the latter is programmable, as is preferred, it is even only necessary<br>
to change the program.<br>
[0033] Higher flexibility is obtained when, in a preferred embodiment of the analy-<br>
sis apparatus, the control device is configured to drive the laser diodes in de-<br>
pendence on a signal or data stored in the control device in such a way that<br>
the same illumination pattern is producible at different given locations in the<br>
recording area in dependence on the signal or data. In the method the laser<br>
diodes can then be driven in such a way in dependence on a signal or data<br>
that the same illumination pattern is producible at one of at least two differ-<br>
ent locations in dependence on the signal or data. The signal can be for ex-<br><br>
ample read in from an external data entry terminal via an interface or trans-<br>
mitted by a device of the value document processing apparatus containing<br>
the analysis apparatus. The drive of the laser diodes can consist in particular<br>
in only some of the laser diodes being switched on or off.<br>
[0034] Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the analysis apparatus, the control device<br>
can in particular drive the surface emitting laser diodes in such a way that an<br>
extension of a detection area of the detection device in the transport direction<br>
is smaller than the extension of the illumination pattern in the transport di-<br>
rection, and the illumination pattern extends further with respect to the detec-<br>
tion area regarded in the transport direction than contrary to the transport di-<br>
rection. The detection area is understood here to be that portion of the<br>
recording area from which the detection device can receive optical radiation<br>
for detection, in particular except for scattered radiation alone. A signal or<br>
data on the transport direction can be made available to the control device in<br>
the above-mentioned ways, which effects the drive of the laser diodes in de-<br>
pendence on the signal or data. This permits two things to be obtained at the<br>
same time. Firstly, the greater extension of the illumination pattern in the<br>
transport direction permits a greater amount of optical radiation, i.e. more<br>
energy, to be radiated onto a given area of the value document, for example a<br>
track with feature substances, upon an analysis, in particular a luminescence<br>
analysis, so that the strength of the detection radiation can be increased. Sec-<br>
ondly, the adjustment of the analysis apparatus, more precisely, of the posi-<br>
tion of the illumination pattern relative to the detection area, can be adjusted<br>
automatically in dependence on the transport device upon installation in the<br>
value document processing apparatus by corresponding signals being trans-<br>
mitted to the control device for example from a drive system of the transport<br>
device or another device of the value document processing apparatus or be-<br>
ing entered manually via an interface. The analysis apparatus can therefore<br>
be designed and used as a simply configurable module.<br>
[0035] In the embodiment just described, the drive can in particular be switchable<br>
between two or more illumination pattern positions.<br><br>
[0036] Alternatively or in combination, in the analysis apparatus the control device<br>
can be configured to drive the laser diodes in such a way that an illumination<br>
pattern changing in time during illumination is produced in the recording<br>
area. In the method it is then preferred that the laser diodes are driven in such<br>
a way that an illumination pattern changing in time during illumination is<br>
produced. The temporal change can be in particular given, for example by a<br>
corresponding configuration and/or programming of the control device.<br>
[0037] The illumination pattern can be changed here in any desired way; in particu-<br>
lar the form of the illumination pattern can be changed. However, it is pre-<br>
ferred for many applications that the laser diodes are driven in such a way<br>
that a given illumination pattern is moved in a given direction at a given<br>
speed. In the analysis apparatus the control device is then configured to drive<br>
the laser diodes in such a way that a given illumination pattern is moved in a<br>
given direction at a given speed. The motion needs only to be effected for a<br>
given period of time, for example until the recording area has been swept<br>
once by the illumination pattern. Further, it is assumed that the laser diodes<br>
are disposed suitably for producing the illumination pattern. This embodi-<br>
ment has a number of advantages since it is usable for different purposes.<br>
[0038] This embodiment makes it possible in particular to record a one- or two-di-<br>
mensional image sequentially. In particular, in this case in the analysis appa-<br>
ratus the detection device only needs to be configured to detect optical radia-<br>
tion from the recording area integrally or only one-dimensionally in a direc-<br>
tion perpendicular to the moving direction of the illumination pattern. Inte-<br>
gral detection is understood here to be a detection that is non-locally resolv-<br>
ing at a given moment. Consecutive illumination of different locations dur-<br>
ing motion of the illumination pattern and corresponding sequential detection<br>
thus make it possible to produce an image by assembling the data or signals<br>
recorded at each single detection into the image.<br><br>
[0039] To permit a complete illumination that is as simple as possible to produce,<br>
the analysis apparatus can be configured in particular to produce a rectangu-<br>
lar, in particular linear, illumination pattern.<br>
[0040] The analysis apparatus can be used in particular for recording one- or two-di-<br>
mensional bar codes through motion of the illumination pattern.<br>
[0041] The value document can fundamentally be at rest during recording. Howev-<br>
er, for faster analysis of a large number of value documents with only one<br>
analysis apparatus, it is preferred in the method that the value document is<br>
moved in a given transport direction and at a given transport speed during il-<br>
lumination.<br>
[0042] The motion speed of the illumination pattern can fundamentally be different<br>
from the transport speed.<br>
[0043] However, in the method the value document is preferably moved in a trans-<br>
port direction at a transport speed, the direction being the transport direction<br>
and the speed being the transport speed. In a particularly preferred embodi-<br>
ment of the processing apparatus for processing value documents, the trans-<br>
port device is then configured to move a value document through the record-<br>
ing area at a given transport speed, and the control device is configured to<br>
drive the laser diode in such a way that the illumination pattern is moved in<br>
the transport direction at the transport speed. This embodiment makes it pos-<br>
sible in a particularly advantageous manner for an area of the analyzed value<br>
document, in particular an optical security feature, to be followed during de-<br>
tection, so that analysis is possible even at very high transport speeds.<br>
[0044] In general, but in particular also in connection with the last described em-<br>
bodiment, it is possible in the analysis apparatus that the control device is<br>
configured to produce an illumination pattern in a given part of the recording<br>
area in dependence on position signals from a position detection device. In<br>
the method it is accordingly preferred that the laser diodes are driven in such<br>
a way that an illumination pattern is produced in a given part of the recording<br><br>
area in dependence on position signals from a position detection device. This<br>
embodiment has the advantage that a device for determining the position of a<br>
value document or the position of a feature to be analyzed optically can be<br>
used to produce the position signal representing the position, in particular<br>
relative to the analysis apparatus, and that precisely this feature can be illu-<br>
minated and analyzed in dependence on said position signal. This permits the<br>
amount of data arising upon an analysis of the total value document to be<br>
strongly reduced, so that an analysis can be effected faster and an evaluation<br>
device for evaluating the detection results can be constructed more simply. In<br>
particular in the case that the detection device is configured for locally re-<br>
solved recording of optical radiation in at least one given spectral range, a<br>
considerable data reduction and an increase in data processing speed can be<br>
obtained when following the feature.<br>
[0045] Alternatively to, or in combination with, the previously described embodi-<br>
ments, in the analysis apparatus the detection device can be configured for<br>
locally resolved recording of optical radiation in at least one given spectral<br>
range, and the control device configured to drive the laser diodes in such a<br>
way that a variation of a sensitivity of the detection device to the optical radi-<br>
ation in the spectral range is at least partly compensated in dependence on<br>
the location. In the method it is accordingly preferred that the laser diodes<br>
are driven in such a way that a variation of a sensitivity of a detection device<br>
for locally resolved recording of optical radiation in at least one given spec-<br>
tral range is at least partly compensated in dependence on the location. In<br>
this way a local adaptation of the illuminance to the sensitivity of the detec-<br>
tion device can be effected, even after a relatively long time, thereby permit-<br>
ting an exact optical analysis lastingly.<br>
[0046] Within the scope of the invention the laser diodes can be operated as contin-<br>
uously luminous or pulsed radiation sources, for which the control device is<br>
then configured accordingly.<br><br>

[0048] A value document processing apparatus 10 in Fig. 1 which comprises an ap-<br>
paratus for optical analysis of value documents 12, in the example bank<br>
notes, has an input pocket 14 for the input of value documents 12 to be pro-<br>
cessed, a singler 16 which can access value documents 12 in the input pocket<br>
14, a transport device 18 with a gate 20, and, along a transport path 22 given<br>
by the transport device 18, an apparatus 24 for analyzing value documents<br>
which is disposed before the gate 20, and after the gate 20 a first output<br>
pocket 26 for value documents recognized as authentic and a second output<br>
pocket 28 for value documents recognized as non-authentic. A central con-<br>
trol and evaluation device 30 is connected at least to the analysis apparatus<br>
24 and the gate 20 via signal connections and is used for driving the analysis<br>
apparatus 24, evaluating check signals from the analysis apparatus 24 and for<br>
driving at least the gate 20 in dependence on the result of evaluation of the<br>
check signals.<br>
[0049] The analysis apparatus 24 in connection with the control and evaluation de-<br>
vice 30 is used for recording optical properties of the value documents 12<br>
and forming check signals representing said properties.<br>
[0050] While a value document 12 is transported past at a given transport speed in a<br>
transport direction T given by the transport path 22, the analysis apparatus 24<br>
records optical property values of the value document, whereby the corre-<br>
sponding check signals are formed.<br>
[0051] From the check signals of the analysis apparatus 24 the central control and<br>
evaluation device 30 determines upon a check signal evaluation whether the<br><br>
value document is recognized as authentic or not according to a given au-<br>
thenticity criterion for the check signals.<br>
[0052] The central control and evaluation device 30 has for this purpose in particu-<br>
lar, besides corresponding interfaces for the sensors, a processor 32 and a<br>
memory 34 connected to the processor 32 and storing at least one computer<br>
program with program code upon the execution of which the processor 32<br>
controls the apparatus or evaluates the check signals and drives the transport<br>
device 18 in accordance with the evaluation.<br>
[0053] In particular, the central control and evaluation device 30, more precisely the<br>
processor 32 therein, can check an authenticity criterion which includes for<br>
example reference data for a value document to be considered authentic<br>
which are given and stored in the memory 34. In dependence on the deter-<br>
mined authenticity or non-authenticity, the central control and evaluation de-<br>
vice 30, in particular the processor 32 therein, drives the transport device 18,<br>
more precisely the gate 20, in such a way that the value document 12 is<br>
transported, according to its determined authenticity, for storage into the first<br>
output pocket 26 for value documents recognized as authentic or into the<br>
second storage pocket 28 for value documents recognized as non-authentic.<br>
[0054] The analysis apparatus 24 is shown more exactly in Fig. 2. It comprises an il-<br>
lumination device 36 for illuminating at least a part of a flat recording area<br>
38 in the transport path 22 which is reached via the transport path 22 by val-<br>
ue documents 12 to be analyzed, and a detection device 40. A control device<br>
42 for driving the illumination device 36, and an evaluation device 44 for<br>
evaluating signals from the detection device 40 are combined in a pro-<br>
grammed data processing device 46 which in this example comprises a pro-<br>
cessor (not shown) and a memory (not shown) which stores a program, exe-<br>
cutable by the processor, for controlling the illumination device 36 and for<br>
evaluating the signals from the detection device 40. The control and evalua-<br>
tion devices 42, 44 are connected to the central control and evaluation device<br>
30 via a signal connection.<br><br>
[0055] The illumination device 36 has a semiconductor device or a semiconductor<br>
chip 48 in which a matrix arrangement of at least fifty surface emitting laser<br>
diodes 50 for emitting optical radiation in a given spectral range is config-<br>
ured (cf. Fig. 7), and an illumination optic 52. The latter possesses, along an<br>
illuminating beam path, a beam-concentrating optic 54, a deflecting element<br>
56 for deflecting the optical radiation leaving the beam-concentrating optic<br>
into the recording area 38, and a focusing optic 58 for focusing the deflected<br>
illumination radiation as an illumination pattern 60 onto an illumination field<br>
62 in the recording area 38.<br>
[0056] The spectral range is given by the type of value documents to be analyzed,<br>
more precisely of security features formed thereon. In this example, lumines-<br>
cence properties of the value documents are to be analyzed. For this purpose<br>
the spectral range is selected so that the excitation radiation for luminescence<br>
of an authentic value document is within the spectral range. The deflecting<br>
element 56 is deflective for the excitation radiation, but in good approxima-<br>
tion transparent to the luminescence radiation, so that the latter can pass<br>
through the deflecting element 56 without deflection.<br>
[0057] Optical radiation emanating from the recording area 38 or from a value doc-<br>
ument 12 therein, i.e. detection radiation, is imaged into infinity by the fo-<br>
cusing optic 58 and passes through the deflecting element 56 without deflec-<br>
tion into the detection device 40, which in the example comprises a detection<br>
optic 64, a spectrographic device 66, for example an imaging optical grating,<br>
illuminated by means of the detection optic 64, and detection elements 68 for<br>
recording the intensity of spatially separated spectral components of the de-<br>
tection radiation which are produced by the spectrographic device 66. For<br>
transmission of detection signals representing the intensity of the impinging<br>
spectral components to the evaluation device 44 the detection elements 68<br>
are connected thereto via signal connections. The detection device 40 there-<br>
fore records the detection radiation in locally unresolved fashion, so that an<br>
integral recording of the detection radiation is given.<br><br>
[0058] As illustrated in Fig. 7, the surface emitting laser diodes 50 are disposed in<br>
the semiconductor device 48 of the illumination device 36 in parallel rows<br>
and columns perpendicular to the rows, whereby the distance between next<br>
adjacent laser diodes is 110 μm immediately before the particular laser<br>
diode.<br>
[0059] To distinguish clearly from conventional edge emitting laser diodes, Fig. 3<br>
shows a schematic plan view of a semiconductor device 70 with an edge<br>
emitting laser diode. The semiconductor device 70 has configured therein,<br>
parallel to the surface of the semiconductor device 70 or of the wafer for<br>
producing the semiconductor device, a resonator 72 which on its edges 74<br>
and 74' along a low indexed lattice plane is partly reflective to the laser radi-<br>
ation to be produced and in which the laser active zone, i.e. a p-n junction, of<br>
the laser diode is located. The output laser radiation is emitted, as indicated<br>
in Fig. 3, perpendicular to the edges 74 and 74' and parallel to the surface.<br>
The beam profile, i.e. the intensity distribution over a plane perpendicular to<br>
the beam direction, is shown in Fig. 4 schematically as a contour diagram in<br>
which x and y are Cartesian coordinates in the plane and the lines represent<br>
lines of equal intensity. One can clearly recognize a saddle shape of the dis-<br>
tribution, which is therefore not rotationally symmetric.<br>
[0060] Fig. 5 shows schematically, in contrast, a surface emitting laser diode 76<br>
wherein a substrate 78 has disposed thereon a resonator 80 which is given by<br>
reflection structures or reflecting layer structures 84, 84', for example in the<br>
form of interference layers, extending parallel to the substrate 78 and the<br>
wafer surface 82. The laser radiation is now emitted perpendicular to the sur-<br>
face 82 of the wafer or the substrate 78. For simplicity's sake the electrodes<br>
and the distribution of the current-carrying layers are not explicitly shown.<br>
[0061] Fig. 6 shows, in a representation corresponding to Fig. 4, the beam profile of<br>
the laser beam emitted by the surface emitting laser diode. It is in good ap-<br>
proximation rotationally symmetric around the beam direction and is there-<br><br>
fore very well suited for further beam shaping with a simple illumination op-<br>
tic with spherical and planar optical elements as in this embodiment.<br>
[0062] The surface emitting laser diodes 50 are configured and contacted in the<br>
semiconductor device 48 so as to be singly drivable independently of each<br>
other.<br>
[0063] Number, arrangement and area of the surface emitting semiconductor diodes<br>
50 and the illumination optic 52 are selected so that a contiguous areal illu-<br>
mination field with a superficial extent of at least 0.5 mm2 can be illuminated<br>
in the recording area 38 homogeneously, i.e. with an intensity fluctuation<br>
based on the maximum intensity in the illumination area smaller than 20%.<br>
[0064] The control device 42 is used for separately driving the laser diodes 50. In<br>
this embodiment the analysis apparatus 24 is designed as a module to be in-<br>
stalled in a value document processing apparatus, said module being so con-<br>
structed that the value documents 12 are fundamentally feedable thereto from<br>
opposite directions.<br>
[0065] To obtain as long an illumination as possible of luminescent substances in a<br>
value document to be analyzed, the control device 42 drives the laser diodes<br>
50 in such a way that an illumination field 62 or an illumination pattern 60<br>
extending further beyond a detection field 86 (cf. Fig. 8) contrary to the<br>
transport direction T than in the transport direction T is produced in the<br>
recording area 38. The detection field 86 is defined in that, except for scat-<br>
tered radiation, only optical radiation from the detection field 86 can reach<br>
the detection device 40. This achieves that an area on the value document is<br>
exposed to the illumination or excitation radiation for a time that is longer<br>
than the time in which it is located in the detection field 86. This permits an<br>
increased luminescence radiation to be obtained, which facilitates the detec-<br>
tion of the luminescence.<br>
[0066] The control device 42 is so adapted, here through corresponding program-<br>
ming, that upon a signal from the central control and evaluation device 30<br><br>
which represents the transport direction T with respect to the position of the<br>
analysis apparatus 24, it drives the laser diodes 50 in such a way that one of<br>
the two illumination patterns 60, 61 shown in Fig. 8 is produced by the laser<br>
beams 88 in the recording area 38 in dependence on the transport direction T<br>
or the signal representing it. They are shifted relative to the chip 48 so that<br>
the above-described effect occurs. For this purpose, only some of the laser<br>
diodes 50 are switched on, namely the laser diodes on the left (a)) or right<br>
(b)) in Fig. 8, while the others remain switched off. The figure does not show<br>
the illumination optic 52 or its influence on the beam path for simplicity's<br>
sake. "Switched on" is understood here to mean that they are operated either<br>
continuously or also in pulsed fashion.<br>
[0067] A second embodiment in Fig. 9 differs from the first embodiment in that<br>
there is now disposed along the transport path 22 upstream of an analysis ap-<br>
paratus 24' an image sensor 90 which is used for recording images of fed val-<br>
ue documents and transfers the images to a central control and evaluation de-<br>
vice 30' via an image signal connection. All other components are un-<br>
changed, so that the same reference signs are used for them as in the first<br>
embodiment and the comments on the first embodiment also apply accord-<br>
ingly here.<br>
[0068] The central control and evaluation device 30' differs from the central control<br>
and evaluation device 30 in that it has an interface (not shown in Fig. 9) for<br>
recording the image data of the image sensor 90 and is configured, in the ex-<br>
ample through a corresponding program module, to determine from the im-<br>
age data the position of an area of the value document, for example of a cer-<br>
tain feature area, to be analyzed more exactly with the optical analysis appa-<br>
ratus 24' and to output it to the analysis apparatus 24'. The image sensor 90<br>
therefore constitutes, in conjunction with the central control and evaluation<br>
device 30', a position detection device.<br>
[0069] The analysis apparatus 24' differs from the analysis apparatus 24 of the first<br>
embodiment solely in that the control device is now changed compared to the<br><br>
control device 42. The control device is, more precisely, configured to drive<br>
the laser diodes 50 differently from the control device 42. As shown<br>
schematically in Fig. 10 in a time sequence a), b), c) in a manner correspond-<br>
ing to Fig. 8, the control device drives the laser diodes 50 in such a way that<br>
laser diodes 92 at the front in the transport direction are switched on and<br>
laser diodes 94 at the back in the transport direction are switched off pro-<br>
gressing in the transport direction T in each case in time sequence. This is ef-<br>
fected in such a way that the same illumination pattern 60' or illumination<br>
field 62' which is produced from laser beams 88 of the front laser diodes is<br>
carried along directed onto the selected area 98 in the transport direction T at<br>
the transport speed T. Thus, in effect only the selected area 98 is illuminated<br>
while it is transported through the detection field 86. This makes it possible<br>
to effectively reduce the production of scattered radiation or interfering radi-<br>
ation from other areas of the value document 12.<br>
[0070] In other embodiments the image sensor 90 can also be replaced by other de-<br>
vices, compared to the last embodiment, that permit recognition of the posi-<br>
tion of certain features to be analyzed. For example, it is also possible, de-<br>
pending on the feature, to use a signal from an edge detector for recognizing<br>
an edge of the value document leading in the transport direction, for example<br>
a light barrier or an ultrasonic sensor, in connection with the known transport<br>
speed and the known position of the feature on the value document to pro-<br>
duce a suitable position signal.<br>
[0071] A further embodiment differs from the first embodiment in that for analysis<br>
of a value document the value document is stopped completely and after it is<br>
stopped in the recording area a start signal is outputted to an analysis appara-<br>
tus 24", for which purpose the central control and evaluation device 30 is<br>
modified accordingly. The analysis apparatus 24" differs from the analysis<br>
apparatus 24 of the first embodiment solely by the configuration or program-<br>
ming of the control and the evaluation devices 42, 44. For all other compo-<br>
nents the same reference signs are therefore used as in the first embodiment<br>
and the comments thereon also apply accordingly here.<br><br>
[0072] The control device is configured to drive the laser diodes 50 in such a way<br>
that they produce an illumination pattern changing in time during illumina-<br>
tion. More precisely, the laser diodes are driven in such a way that the same<br>
illumination pattern 60" is moved over the value document 12 at a speed that<br>
is constant in the example, as illustrated in Fig. 11 corresponding in repre-<br>
sentation to Fig. 10 in a time sequence a), b), c). At the same time the reflect-<br>
ed detection radiation is recorded at constant time intervals, in case of pulsed<br>
drive of the laser diodes in synchronism with the pulses, by the detection de-<br>
vice 40 and the evaluation device 44 and stored in the evaluation device 44<br>
according to the time sequence and thus the location on the value document,<br>
or transferred directly to the central control and evaluation device. Thus, an<br>
image of the value document is obtained. Optionally after intermediate stor-<br>
age in the evaluation device, the corresponding image data are transmitted to<br>
the central control and evaluation device 30 and evaluated further there.<br>
[0073] The illumination pattern 60" has a rectangular slot shape, as illustrated in<br>
Fig. 11. The illumination pattern 60" is preferably so narrow that it can serve<br>
as a "virtual" entrance slit for the detection device or the spectrographic de-<br>
vice, which then need no longer have an entrance slit.<br>
[0074] Such an analysis apparatus can also be used advantageously for recognizing<br>
bar codes. In particular in this case the detection device need then only have<br>
a detection element but not a spectrographic device.<br>
[0075] In another variant, it is possible to provide in the detection device, instead of<br>
only one detection element, a row of detection elements by means of which<br>
areas in the recording or detection area are recordable in locally resolved<br>
fashion along a row perpendicular to the moving direction of the illumination<br>
pattern. Such an analysis apparatus can in particular also be used for record-<br>
ing two-dimensional bar codes.<br>
[0076] In a further embodiment, the analysis apparatus differs from the analysis ap-<br>
paratus of the first embodiment by a different detection device 40'" as well as<br>
a different control and evaluation device.<br><br>
[0077] The detection device 40"' (cf. Fig. 12) has a field 100 with a two-dimension-<br>
al arrangement of detection elements 102 for locally resolved detection of<br>
optical radiation coming from the recording area 38 or the detection field 86,<br>
as well as an imaging optic 104 for focusing the infinite beam path after the<br>
focusing optic 58 onto the arrangement of detection elements 102. The de-<br>
tection elements 102 can have different sensitivities to optical radiation in<br>
the same spectral range, for example due to fluctuations during production or<br>
to different aging.<br>
[0078] The control device 42" is changed, i.e. configured, as opposed to the control<br>
device 42 in such a way as to drive the laser diodes 50 according to the sensi-<br>
tivity of the detection elements 102 in such a way that the differences in sen-<br>
sitivity are evened out. More precisely, this means that the laser diodes 50<br>
are driven in such a way that all detection elements 102 output the same de-<br>
tection signals.<br>
[0079] Errors in the imaging optic can also be compensated in this way.<br>
[0080] The evaluation device 44" is configured to record the detection signals of the<br>
detection elements 102.<br>
[0081] In a particularly preferred embodiment, the control device is configured to<br>
record the detection signals from the detection elements for a given drive of<br>
the laser diodes by means of the evaluation device, and to automatically<br>
change the drive of the laser diodes in such a way that all detection elements<br>
emit the same detection signal.<br>
[0082] This corresponds in a sense to a calibration of the analysis apparatus. This<br>
process can, depending on the embodiment, be carried out automatically at<br>
given intervals in the service life of the analysis apparatus or upon each<br>
switch-on or switch-off of the analysis apparatus, for which purpose the con-<br>
trol device can be configured accordingly, for example through correspond-<br>
ing programming.<br><br>
[0083] Yet a further embodiment differs from the first embodiment only in that the<br>
surface emitting laser diodes 50 are configured in the semiconductor device<br>
and contacted so as to be drivable separately or independently of each other<br>
in at least two groups, in this embodiment row by row. The control device 42<br>
is accordingly modified in such a way as to drive the groups, i.e. here the<br>
rows, singly separately from each other, whereby the same illumination pat-<br>
tern as in the first embodiment can be obtained.<br>
[0084] Further embodiments differ from the previously described embodiments only<br>
by the arrangement of the laser diodes 50 in the semiconductor device 48'.<br>
All other parts are unchanged. The surface emitting laser diodes 50 are now<br>
disposed in the semiconductor device 48' (cf. Fig. 13) on the grid points of a<br>
hexagonal point grid at a distance of nearest neighbors smaller than 120 um,<br>
in the example 100 jim, thereby making it possible to obtain a further in-<br>
crease in the homogeneity of the illumination pattern.<br>
[0085] In yet further embodiments, the illumination device does not have the de-<br>
flecting element 56, so that a straight illuminating beam path is obtained.<br>
The detection device is configured and disposed for detecting optical radia-<br>
tion after transmission through the value document. It has its own optic, cor-<br>
responding in its properties to the focusing optic, for imaging at least a por-<br>
tion of the value document on the side not illuminated by the illumination<br>
device.<br>
[0086] In other embodiments, the illumination of the value document can also be ef-<br>
fected at angles other than 90°, in which case the detection device might be<br>
configured and disposed accordingly.<br><br>
