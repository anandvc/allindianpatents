Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the surgical illumination and sterilization arts. It finds particular application in conjunction with coverings for lighthead handles and controls in an operating room setting and will Joe described with particular reference thereto. It Is to foe appreciated, however, that the invention is not limited to the aforementioned application and can foe used whenever there is a need to provide an interface device between a. sterile field and non-sterilized apparatus or surface.<br>
In modern operating rooms, large overhead lightheads are used to illuminate the surgical site. The surgeon or nurse typically use manual means to position the overhead lamp, aim it at the region of interest of a patient, adjust the spot pattern of the lamp., and adjust the intensity of the lamp. To avoid unnecessary confusion and to save time, the surgeon will often manipulate the surgical lamp on his/her own. However, this requires the surfaces touched by the surgeon to be sterile in order to preserve good sterile technique.<br>
One method of preserving good sterile technique is to sterilize portions of the lighthead with, which the surgeon will interface. These positions typically include a central downwardly extending handle which the surgeon grips to move the lighthead into position, and which the surgeon can twist to adjust the beam pattern. The lighthead. handles are typically removable from the surgical lighthead housing so that they can be sterilized between  surgical  procedures.     However,   sterilizing<br><br><br>
lighthead handles is time consuming and expensive.<br>
Another method of providing a sterile interface for the surgeon is to cover portions of the lighthead handles with which the surgeon will interface with physical barriers, such as sterile plastic or rubber covers. Such covers are disposed after a single use to minimize the risk of contamination. A problem with this method is that covers capable of encasing all of the lighthead control interface components are not available, requiring a non-sterile support person to assist the surgeon. For instance, a cover might encase the handle a.1 lowing the surgeon to manipulate lighthead position and beam pattern control. using the handle him/herself. However, assistance of non-sterile personnel is necessary when the light intensity is to be changed or when other controls provided on or near the lighthead are to be adjusted.<br>
One novel approach in the surgical lighting arts proposes one or more lighting control input means such as switches on the bezel area of a surgical lighthead adjacent the handle area. This enables the surgeon to loosely grasp the lighthead handle and comfortably actuate the control buttons using the natural motion of the upwardly extended thumb. Such system is taught in co-pending provisional application serial number<br>
entitled Ergonomic Controls for a Surgical Lighting System, docket number MED 2 1248, assigned to the assignee of the present invention and incorporated herein by reference. Although this novel solution provides a surgeon with access to lighthead control buttons, the. bezol area is part of the lighthead and is therefore not sterilized with the removable handle. Simply, the controls are not in the sterile field.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an interface for<br><br><br>
Yet another object of the invention is the provision of an interface in the form cof a disposable sterile cover selectively connectable to the handle of a standard surgical lighthead. The cover is semi rigid so that it can be snapped into place on the lighthead handle quickly and easily. An upper portion of the sterile cover is flexible to enable operation of lighthead control inputs through the cover. In one embodiment, the cover is of a unitary construction. Alternatively, the cover is formed of two or materials forming a thin somewhat stiff lower portion attached with a thin flexible upper portion.<br>
A still further object of the invention is the provision of a disposable sterile cover for surgical, lamps including a clear lens portion to enable the cover- to be used in connection with lighthead handles provided with integrated video cameras. The clear lens portion of the cover provides the optics of the integrated camera with a clear and unobstructed view path to the surgical site..<br>
Still other advantages and benefits of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading and understanding of the following detailed description.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
In a first preferred embodiment of tho present invention/ as can be seen in FIGURES 1-3 and. 6, the sterile interface is a disposable sterile cover 10 having an overall cone shape. The subject cover provides a sterile interface between the sterile field 1 and an associated lighthead handle 12 for moving an overhead lighthead 14 into position. The subject cover further provides a sterile interface between the surgeon and lighting control inputs including a beam pattern select input 16, and intensity control inputs 18. In the illustrated embodiment of the invention 10; the pattern select control 16 is effected by rotating the lighthead handle as known in the art. The handle is also used to position the lamp manually. A plurality of lighting control input buttons 18 for controlling the intensity of the lamp are disposed on a bezel area of the lighthead directly above the handle. Functionally, the sterile cover 10 of the invention slides over and attaches onto the handle 12 covering its entirety, while simultaneously<br><br><br>
covering the plurality of lighting control buttons 19 on the bezel area of the surgical lighthead. This provides a convenient and inexpensive interface between the sterile field 1 on the outer face side of the cover 10 and non-sterile portions of the lighthead on. the back: side face of the cover. As shown best in FIGURES 2, 3, and 6, the sterile cover 10 of the invention is of a generally-over all cup-like shape and includes a lower grippable portion 20, an intermediate cone-shaped portion 22, and an upper window area 24, The lower grippable portion 20 includes a cylindrical, body portion 28 and a closed end 26 having a generally circular shape.<br>
Connection means 30 are provided on the sterile cover 10 for attaching the cover to an associated surgical lighthead handle 12. Preferably, the connection means include one or more bands of circular grooves 32 formed circumferentially around the cylindrical body portion at one or more selected positions between the closed end 26 and a rounded region 34 opposite the closed end. In the preferred embodiment is illustrated, only a single groove is used to provide the connecting function. The connecting means 30 enables the sterile cover 10 to be easily installed onto an. associated lighthead handle having a corresponding connecting means 30 as shown in FIGURE 6. The rounded region provides a smooth transition between the lower grippable portion 2 0 and the intermediate cone-shaped portion 22. This helps guide the cover onto the handle during installation.<br>
Preferably, the cover fits loosely around the handle and suitable contact is made at the respective connecting means areas 30, 30' so that the surgeon has the<br><br><br>
option to either rotate the cover 10 about the handle 12 such as to position a clear portion 40 over the light intensity controls 18, or firmly grasp the cover 10 and handle 12 to rotate them together such as to adjust the beam pattern. In the preferred embodiment, the mating groove 32 provides enough force to prevent the cover- 10 from falling off from the handle due to gravity. Additionally, the mating groove provides enough force to prevent the surgeon from inadvertently dislodging the cover during surgery, such as by bumping it, but not so much force as to prevent the cover 10 from being removed easily after surgery.<br>
In the embodiment shown in FIGURES 2 and 3, the cover 10 is adapted for fitting onto a standard surgical lighthead handle. Preferably, at least a portion 40 of the upper end of the cover 10 is clear so that the lighthead controls 1B are both visibly and mechanically accessible through the cover. Alternatively, t.he entire upper end of the cover can be formed of a clear or semi-transparent material so that the lighthead controls are visible regardless of the orientation of the  cover relative to the handle.<br>
It is to be appreciated that although grooves are preferred and only a single groove is illustrated, other intermatable shape configurations can be used on the handle and cover as well. However, in the present invention, the groove arrangement is preferred because it enables the cover 10 to rotate relative to the associated surgical lighthead handle 12 while the cover is connected to the handle. This is beneficial because the axisymmetry of the cover and handle allows the user to attach the cover  without  concern  for  relative  circumferential<br><br><br>
alignment.<br>
The  intermediate  cone-shaped portion  22  is<br>
essentially an extension of the lower grippable portion 20, The intermediate portion 22 is tapered as illustrated to closely surround and cover the upper portion of an associated surgical lighthead handle. Preferably, the intermediate portion has inner dimensions to provide a loose fit with minimum contact between the cover and the lighthead handle,<br>
Preferably, the lower grippable portion 20 as well as the intermediate cone-shaped portion 22 a.re formed of a material to provide the cover 10 with the desired characteristics of being flexible enough to enable the connecting means 32 of the cover to snap into a corresponding connecting moans 30' in the surgical lighthead handle without cracking. The material is selected to provide a disposable sterile cover 10 that supports its own weight and retains the shape illustrated while in free space. More specifically, in accordance with the present: invention, the subject disposable sterile cover requires no additional external support members to maintain its shape during shipping, handling, and while being installed onto the lighthead prior to use. Although any suitable materials can be used, plastics such as thermosetting plastics and thermo formed AB$ can be used as well as elastomers including synthetic rubbers, santoprene rubber, low density polyethylene, and others Since the sterile cover 10 is disposable after each use, there is no need, to form the cover from materials which can be repeatedly sterilized. In that way, cost advantages can be realized. It is to be appreciated, however, that the cover is sterilized initially, for its first use, typically by gas or radiation techniques.<br><br>
Preferably, the entire cover 10 is of a unitary construction and therefore lormed of a single material selected from the list above. However, the present invention contemplates forming portions of the cover from materials having different duroitieter values so that the upper window area 24 is softer and more flexible than the lower grippable portion. This enables the cover 10 to be rather sccuredly snap fitted onto the lighthead handle 12 while permitting soft action and tactile feedback through the upper area 24 while actuating the intensity control inputs 18.<br>
With continued reference to the FIGURES 2, 3, and 6, at least; a portion 40 of the upper window area 24 of the subject sterile cover 10 is formed of a transparent material to enable visualization of the lighthead controls 16, 18. Preferably, as shown in FIGURES 2 and 3, the entire ring-shaped upper window area 24 is transparent so that the control indicia are visible through the subject sterile cover 10 regardless of the orientation of the cover relative to the lighthead 14 and handle 12.<br>
it is to be appreciated that the cover 10 is preferably symmetrical about a longitudinal axis 38 extending along each of the lower grippable portion 20, the intermediate cone-shaped portion 22, and the upper window area 24. When the cover ID is installed onto an associated lighthead handle 12, longitudinal axis 38 of the cover i. s coincident and coextensive with the longitudinal axis 3B' defined by the handle.<br>
in the embodiment shown in FIGURES 4 and 5, the cover 10' is adapted for fitting onto a standard surgical lighthead handle provided with an integrated video camera. Comparison with the embodiment of FIGURES 2 and 3 shows<br><br><br>
that the lower cylindrical shaped grippable portion 2CV of the cover of FIGURES 4 and 5 is somewhat wider in cross-section in order to accommodate the enlarged size of the handle with an integrated camera. In addition, the cover 10 includes a clear lens portion 40 formed on the free distal end of the cylindrical body portion 28'. This provides the optics of the camera a clear and unobstructed view path to the surgical site.<br>
The invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments. Modifications und alterations will occur to others upon a reading and understanding of the preceding description. It is intended that the invention be construed as including all such modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.<br><br><br><br><br>
