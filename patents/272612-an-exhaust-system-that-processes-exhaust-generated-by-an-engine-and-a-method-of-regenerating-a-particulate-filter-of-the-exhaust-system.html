CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]     This   application   claims  the   benefit  of  U.S.   Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/934,988, filed on June 15,2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
STATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT RIGHTS<br>
[0002]    This invention was produced pursuant to U.S. Government<br>
Contract No. DE-FC-04-03 AL67635 with the Department of Energy (DoE). The<br>
U.S. Government has certain rights in this invention.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0003] The present disclosure relates to methods and systems for<br>
heating particulate filters.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0004] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present disclosure and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0005] Diesel engines typically have higher efficiency than gasoline<br>
engines due to an increased compression ratio and a higher energy density of<br>
dlesel fuel. A diesel combustion cycle produces particulate that are typically<br>
filtered from diesel exhaust by a particulate filter (PF) that is disposed in the<br><br>
exhaust stream. Over time, the PF becomes full and the trapped diesel<br>
particulates must be removed. During regeneration, the diesel parUculates are<br>
burned within the PF.<br>
[0006] Conventional regeneration methods inject fuel into the exhaust<br>
stream after the main combustion event. The post-combustion injected fuel is<br>
combusted over one or more catalysts placed in the exhaust stream. The heat<br>
released during the fuel combustion on the catalysts increases the exhaust<br>
temperature, which bums the trapped soot particles in the PF. This approach,<br>
however, can result in higher temperature excursions than desired, which can be<br>
detrimental to exhaust system components, including the PF.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007] Accordingly, an exhaust system that processes exhaust<br>
generated by an engine is provided. The system generally includes a<br>
particulate filter (PF) that filters parUculates from the exhaust wherein an<br>
upstream end of the PF receives exhaust from the engine. A grid of electrically<br>
resistive material is applied to an exterior upstream surface of the PF and<br>
selectively heats exhaust passing through the grid to initiate combustion of<br>
particulates within the PF. A catalyst coating is applied to the PF that increases<br>
a temperature of the combustion of the particulates within the PF.<br>
[0008] In other features, a method of regenerating a particulate filter<br>
(PF) of an exhaust system is provided. The method generally includes:<br>
applying a grid of electrically resistive material to a front exterior surface of the<br><br>
PF; heating the grid by supplying current to the electrically resistive material;<br>
inducing combustion of particulates present on the front surface of the PF via<br>
the heated grid; directing heat generated by combustion of the particulate into<br>
the PF to induce combustion of particulates within the PF via exhaust; and<br>
increasing a temperature of the combustion of the particulates via a carbon<br>
monoxide conversion of the exhaust.<br>
[0009] Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group) and memory that executes one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, and/or<br>
other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
[0017] Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle 10 including a<br>
diesel engine system 11 is illustrated in accordance with various aspects of the<br>
present disclosure. It is appreciated that the diesel engine system 11 is merely<br>
exemplary in nature and that the particulate filter regeneration system described<br>
herein can be implemented in various engine systems implementing a particulate<br>
filter. Such engine systems may include, but are not limited to, gasoline direct<br>
Injection engine systems and homogeneous charge compression ignition engine<br>
systems. For ease of the discussion, the disclosure will be discussed in the<br>
context of a diesel engine system.<br><br>
[0018] A turbocharged diesel engine system 11 includes an engine 12<br>
that combusts an air and fuel mixture to produce drive torque. Air enters the<br>
system by passing through an air filter 14. Air passes through the air filter 14 and<br>
is drawn into a turbocharger 18. The turbocharger 18 compresses the fresh air<br>
entering the system 11. The greater the compression of the air generally, the<br>
greater the output of the engine 12. Compressed air then passes through an air<br>
cooler 20 before entering into an intake manifold 22.<br>
[0019] Air within the intake manifold 22 is distributed into cylinders 26.<br>
Although four cylinders 26 are Illustrated, It Is appreciated that the systems and<br>
methods of the present disclosure can be implemented in engines having a<br>
plurality of cylinders including, but not limited to, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12<br>
cylinders. It is also appreciated that the systems and methods of the present<br>
disclosure can be implemented in a v-type cylinder configuration. Fuel is Injected<br>
into the cylinders 26 by fuel injectors 28. Heat from the compressed air ignites<br>
the air/fuel mixture. Combustion of the air/fuel mixture creates exhaust Exhaust<br>
exits the cylinders 26 into the exhaust system.<br>
[0020] The exhaust system includes an exhaust manifold 30, a diesel<br>
oxidation catalyst (catalyst) 32, and a particulate filter (PF) 34. Optionally, an<br>
EGR valve (not shown) re-circulates a portion of the exhaust back into the Intake<br>
manifold 22. The remainder of the exhaust is directed into the turbocharger 18 to<br>
drive a turbine. The turbine facilitates the compression of the fresh air received<br>
from the air filter 14. Exhaust flows from the turbocharger 18 through the catalyst<br>
32 and the PF 34.   The catalyst 32 oxidizes the exhaust based on the post<br><br>
combustion air/fuel ratio. The PF 34 receives exhaust from the catalyst 32 and<br>
filters any particulate matter particulates present in the exhaust<br>
[0021] A control module 44 controls the engine 12 and PF regeneration<br>
based on various sensed and/or modeled Information. More specifically, the<br>
control module 44 estimates particulate matter loading of the PF 34. When the<br>
estimated particulate matter loading achieves a threshold level (e.g., 5 grams/liter<br>
of particulate matter) and the exhaust flow rate is within a desired range, current<br>
is controlled to the PF 34 via a power source 46 to initiate the regeneration<br>
process. The duration of the regeneration process varies based upon the<br>
amount of particulate matter within the PF 34. It is anticipated, that the<br>
regeneration process can last between 1-6 minutes. Current is only applied,<br>
however, during an initial portion of the regeneration process. More specifically,<br>
the electric energy heats the face of the PF 34 for a threshold period (e.g., 1-2<br>
minutes). Exhaust passing through the front face is heated. The remainder of<br>
the regeneration process is achieved using the heat generated by combustion of<br>
the particulate matter present near the heated face of the PF 34 or by the heated<br>
exhaust passing through the PF 34.<br>
[0022] With particular reference to Figure 2, the PF 34 is preferably a<br>
monolith particulate trap and includes alternating closed cells/channels 50 and<br>
opened cells/channels 52. The cells/channels 50, 52 are typically square cross-<br>
sections, running axiaily through the part Walls 58 of the PF 34 are preferably<br>
comprised of a porous ceramic honeycomb wall of cordierite material. It is<br>
appreciated that any ceramic comb material Is considered within the scope of the<br><br>
present disclosure. Adjacent channels are alternatively plugged at each end as<br>
shown at 56. This forces the diesel aerosol through the porous substrate walls<br>
which act as a mechanical filter. Particulate matter is deposited within the closed<br>
channels 50 and exhaust exits through the opened channels 52. Partlculate<br>
matter 59 flow into the PF 34 and are trapped therein.<br>
[0023] For regeneration purposes, a grid 64 including an electrically<br>
resistive material is attached to the front exterior surface referred to as the front<br>
face of the PF 34. Current is supplied to the resistive material to generate<br>
thermal energy. It is appreciated that thick film heating technology may be used<br>
to attach the grid 64 to the PF 34. For example, a heating material such as Silver<br>
or Nichrome may be coated then etched or applied with a mask to the front face<br>
of the PF 34. In various other embodiments, the grid 64 is composed of<br>
electrically resistive material such as stainless steel and attached to the PF 34<br>
using an adhesive or press fit to the PF 34.<br>
[0024] It is also appreciated that the resistive material may be applied<br>
in various single or multi-path patterns as shown in Figure 3. Segments of<br>
resistive material can be removed to generate the pathways. In various<br>
embodiments a perforated heater insert 70 as shown in Figure 4 may be<br>
attached to the front face of the PF 34. In any of the above mentioned<br>
embodiments, exhaust passing through the PF 34 carries thermal energy<br>
generated at the front face of the PF 34 a short distance down the channels 50,<br>
52. The increased thermal energy ignites the particulate matter present near the<br>
inlet of the PF 34. The heat generated from the combustion of the particulates is<br><br>
then directed through the PF 34 to induce combustion of the remaining<br>
particulates within the PF 34.<br>
[0025] With particular reference to Figure 5, a catalyst coating is<br>
additionally applied to the PF 34. According to the present disclosure, the<br>
catalyst coating is distributed in sub-sections at varying densities optimized by an<br>
operating temperature of the PF 34. As can be appreciated, the density of the<br>
catalyst coatings can be applied In a step-like format or a continuous or linear<br>
format.<br>
[0026] As shown in Figure 5, an exemplary PF 34 includes an inlet that<br>
allows the exhaust to enter the PF 34 and an outlet that allows the exhaust to exit<br>
the PF 34. The PF 34 includes a first sub-section 72 and a second sub-section<br>
74. The first sub-section 72 is located a first distance from the inlet The second<br>
sub-section 74 is located a second distance from the inlet that is greater than the<br>
first distance. The first sub-section 72 is coated with catalysts at a first density.<br>
The first coating can include an oxidation catalyst that reduces Hydrocarbon and<br>
Carbon Monoxide. The oxidation catalyst includes, but is not limited to,<br>
palladium, platinum, and/or the like. The second sub-section 74 can be coated<br>
with catalysts at a second density or alternatively, not coated at all. If coated, the<br>
second density is less than the first density. The second coating can also include<br>
an oxidation catalyst that reduces Hydrocarbon and Carbon Monoxide, as<br>
discussed above.<br>
[0027] When the PF 34 includes the catalyst coating near the inlet, the<br>
catalyst material increases the exhaust flow temperature via the Carbon<br><br>
Monoxide conversion and improves the soot combustion. By enhancing soot<br>
combustion in the front of the PF 34, the overall cooling effect of the high exhaust<br>
flows can be mitigated. The reverse is true near the outlet of the PF 34. By<br>
eliminating or reducing catalyst coating in the rear of the PF 34, excessive<br>
temperatures that may cause damage to the PF 34 can be reduced.<br>
[0028] Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing<br>
description that the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be<br>
implemented in a variety of forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been<br>
described in connection with particular examples thereof, the true scope of the<br>
disclosure should not be so limited since other modifications will become<br>
apparent to the skilled practitioner upon a study of the drawings, specification,<br>
