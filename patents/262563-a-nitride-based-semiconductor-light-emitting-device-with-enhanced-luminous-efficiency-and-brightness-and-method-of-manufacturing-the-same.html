				<td>Technical Meld<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a light emitting device and a method of manu-<br>
facturing the same. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nitride based<br>
semiconductor light emitting device with enhanced luminous efficiency and brightness<br>
and a method of manufacturing the light emitting device.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	A light emitting device refers to an element in which minority carriers (electrons or<br>
holes) injected using a p-n junction structure of a semiconductor are produced and<br>
certain light is emitted due to recombination of the carriers. A light emitting source is<br>
formed from any one or combination of compound semiconductor materials such as<br>
GaAs, AlGaAs, GaN, InGaN and AlGalnP, so that a variety of colors can be im-<br>
plemented. For example, a red light emitting device may be formed from GaAsP or the<br>
like; a green light emitting device may be formed from GaP, InGaN or the like; a blue<br>
light emitting device may be formed using an InGaN/GaN double hetero structure; and<br>
a UV light emitting device may be formed using an AlGaN/GaN or AlGaN/AlGaN<br>
structure.<br>
[3]	In particular, GaN has a direct bandgap of 3.4eV at a normal temperature and a<br>
direct energy bandgap of 1.9eV (InN) to 3.4eV (GaN) or 6.2eV (A1N) by combining<br>
with a substance such as InN or A1N. Thus, GaN is a substance with great applicability<br>
to an optical element due to its broad wavelength range from visible light to ultraviolet<br>
light. Since the wavelength can be adjusted in such a manner, full-color imple-<br>
mentation can be made by means of red, green and blue light emitting devices with a<br>
short wavelength range, so that the applicability to a general illumination market as<br>
well as a display device market is expected to be greatly increased.<br>
[4]	Light emitting devices have characteristics of lower power consumption, longer<br>
lifespan, better installation in a narrow space and stronger resistance against vibration<br>
as compared with existing bulbs or fluorescent lamps. Since the light emitting devices<br>
are used as display devices and backlights and have superior characteristics in view of<br>
the reduction in power consumption and the durability, many studies for applying the<br>
light emitting devices to a general illumination field have been recently conducted. In<br>
the future, their applicability is expected to extend to a backlight of a large-sized LCD-<br>
TV, a vehicle headlight and general illumination. To this end, it is necessary to<br>
improve luminous efficiency of light emitting devices, solve a heat dissipation<br><br>
problem, and achieve high brightness and output of the light emitting devices.<br>
[5]	Many techniques for enhancing the performance of light emitting devices have been<br>
currently developed. There are various indexes indicating the performance of light<br>
emitting devices, such as luminous efficiency (lm/W), internal quantum efficiency (%),<br>
external quantum efficiency (%) and extraction efficiency (%). The extraction<br>
efficiency is determined as a ratio of electrons injected into the light emitting device to<br>
photons emitted to the outside of the light emitting device. That is, the light emitting<br>
device becomes bright as the extraction efficiency becomes high. Since the extraction<br>
efficiency of the light emitting device is much influenced by the shape and surface<br>
pattern of a chip, the structure of a chip and a packaging type, careful attention should<br>
be paid when designing the light emitting device.<br>
rgi	Fi°. 1 is a sectional view showin0 a conventional li^ht emitting device with a<br>
horizontal structure.'<br>
[7]	Referring to Fig. 1, the light emitting device comprises a substrate 1, an N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 2 formed on the substrate 1, an active layer 3 formed on a portion<br>
of the N-type semiconductor layer 2 and a P-type semiconductor layer 4. That is, after<br>
the N-type semiconductor layer 2, the active layer 3 and the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 4 have been sequentially formed on the substrate 1, predetermined regions of the<br>
P-type semiconductor layer 4 and the active layer 3 are etched to expose a portion of<br>
the N-type semiconductor layer 2. Then, a predetermined voltage is applied to top<br>
surfaces of the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 2 and the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 4.<br>
[8]	Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing a conventional light emitting device with a flip<br>
chip structure.<br>
[9]	Referring to Fig. 2, the light emitting device comprises an N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 2, an active layer 3 and a P-type semiconductor layer 4, which are sequentially<br>
formed on a base substrate 1. The light emitting device further comprises a submount<br>
substrate 5 onto which the base substrate 1 is flip-chip bonded using metal bumps 8<br>
and 9. To this end, the N-type semiconductor layer 2, the active layer 3 and the P-type<br>
semiconductor layer 4 are sequentially formed on the predetermined substrate 1, and<br>
portions of the P-type semiconductor layer 4 and the active layer 3 are etched to<br>
expose the N-type semiconductor layer 2 such that a light emitting cell can be formed.<br>
Further, the additional submount substrate 5 is prepared to form first and second<br>
electrodes 6 and 7 thereon, and the P-type and N-type metal bumps 8 and 9 are then<br>
formed on the first and second electrodes 6 and 7, respectively. Thereafter, the light<br>
emitting cell is bonded with the submount substrate 5 such that P and N electrodes of<br>
the light emitting cell are bonded with the P-type and N-type metal bumps 8 and 9, re-<br>
spectively, to fabricate a light emitting device. Since such a conventional light emitting<br><br>
device with a flip chip structure has high heat dissipation efficiency and hardly has<br>
shield of light, there is an advantage in that its light efficiency is increased by 50% or<br>
more as compared with a conventional light emitting device. Further, since a gold wire<br>
for driving a light emitting device is not necessary, many applications to a variety of<br>
small-sized packages can be considered.<br>
[10]	Light produced from a light emitting layer of a light emitting device is emitted from<br>
all the surfaces of a chip, and light extraction efficiency is generally determined by a<br>
critical angle of light. However, when the conventional light emitting device is etched<br>
to expose an N-type semiconductor layer, side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer and the active layer are vertically processed such that a portion of light produced<br>
within the light emitting device is totally reflected on the etched surface that is<br>
processed vertically from a horizontal plane. Then, a considerable amount of light to<br>
be totally reflected is not emitted to the outside but dissipated within the light emitting<br>
device due to the internal reflection. That is, there is a problem in that luminous<br>
efficiency in which electric energy is converted into light energy and the light is then<br>
emitted to the outside of a light emitting device is low.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[36]	Hereinafter, a light emitting device and a manufacturing method thereof according<br>
to the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings. However, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth<br>
herein but can be implemented in different forms. Rather, the preferred embodiments<br>
are merely provided to allow the present invention to be completely described herein<br>
and to fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
[37]	Fig. 3 is a conceptual sectional view illustrating a light emitting device with a<br>
horizontal structure according to the present invention.<br>
[38]	Referring to Fig. 3, the light emitting device comprises a substrate 10, and an re-<br>
type semiconductor layer 20, an active layer 30 and a P-type semiconductor layer 40,<br>
which are sequentially formed on the substrate 10. Each of side surfaces of the P-type<br>
semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and a portion of the N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 20 has a slope of 80 to 20° from a horizontal plane such that a critical angle of<br>
light can be changed by such surfaces and light can be easily extracted. Therefore,<br>
luminous efficiency of a light emitting device can be improved.<br>
[39]	Figs. 4 and 5 are sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a light<br>
emitting device according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[40]	Referring to Fig. 4, an N-type semiconductor layer 20, an active layer 30 and a P-<br>
type semiconductor layer 40 are sequentially formed on a substrate 10.<br><br>
[41]	The substrate 10 refers to a general wafer used for fabricating a light emitting<br>
device and is made of at least any one of Al O , SiC, ZnO, Si, GaAs, GaP, LiAl 0 ,<br>
BN, A1N and GaN. In this embodiment, a crystal growth substrate made of sapphire is<br>
used.<br>
[42]	A buffer layer (not shown) may be further formed on the substrate 10 to reduce<br>
lattice mismatch between the substrate 10 and the subsequent layers upon growth of<br>
crystals. The buffer layer may contain GaN or A1N that is a semiconductor material.<br>
[43]	The N-type semiconductor layer 20 is a layer in which electrons are produced and is<br>
preferably made from GaN doped with N-type impurities. However, the N-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 20 is not limited thereto but may use a material layer having a variety<br>
of semiconductor properties. The N-type semiconductor layer 20 including N-type Al<br>
Ga N<x is formed in this embodiment. further the p-tvne semiconductor laver></x>
I-x<br>
40 is a layer in which holes are produced and is preferably made from GaN doped with<br>
P-type impurities. However, the P-type semiconductor layer 40 is not limited thereto<br>
but may use a material layer with a variety of semiconductor properties. The P-type<br>
semiconductor layer 40 including P-type Al Ga N(0<x is formed in this></x>
X	1-X<br>
embodiment. Moreover, InGaN may be used as the semiconductor layer. Further, each<br>
of the N-type and P-type semiconductor layers 20 and 40 may be formed as a multiple<br>
layer.<br>
[44]	The active layer 30 has a predetermined bandgap and is a region where a quantum<br>
well is formed so that electrons and holes are recombined. The active layer 30 may<br>
contain InGaN. The wavelength of light emitted through the combination of electrons<br>
and holes varies according to the kind of a material constituting the active layer 30.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that a semiconductor material contained in the active layer 30<br>
be controlled depending on a target wavelength.<br>
[45]	The aforementioned material layers are formed through a variety of deposition and<br>
growth methods including MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition),<br>
CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), PCVD (Plasma-enhanced Chemical Vapor<br>
Deposition), MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy), HVPE (Hybride Vapor Phase Epitaxy)<br>
and the like.<br>
[46]	Thereafter, portions of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and the active layer 30<br>
are removed through a predetermined etching process to expose a portion of the N-typc<br>
semiconductor layer 20. An etching mask pattern is formed on the P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 40, and the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and the active layer 30 are<br>
then removed through a dry or wet etching process to expose the N-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 20.<br>
[47]	Generally, in order to perform the etching process, a photoresist has been applied<br>
onto a top surface of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 at a thickness of 1 to 2D, and<br><br>
then soft-baked at a temperature of 80 to 90°C is performed. Next, an exposure process<br>
in which light in a UV range is irradiated through a predetermined photo mask to<br>
transfer a pattern formed on the mask to the applied photoresist is executed. Thereafter,<br>
the photoresist is hard-baked at a temperature of 100 to 120°C, and a developing<br>
process in which the photoresist at a portion with relatively weak combination through<br>
the exposure process is melted using a solvent is executed. A predetermined etching<br>
mask pattern is formed on'the P-type semiconductor layer 40 through the above<br>
process.<br>
[481	However, in this embodiment, the photoresist is applied at a thickness of 3 to 50D<br>
which is thicker as compared with the prior art when the etching mask pattern is<br>
formed, and the exposure process is performed after the soft-baking. Next, if the<br>
photoresist is directly developed without the hard-baking, a developed side surface of<br>
the remaining photoresist is formed into an inclined surface not perpendicular (90°) to<br>
but inclined at a predetermined slope from a horizontal plane. Subsequently, if exposed<br>
regions of the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and the pre-<br>
determined N-type semiconductor layer 20 are etched using the etching mask pattern<br>
with such a slope of the side surface, the side surfaces of the etched P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 40, active layer 30 and N-type semiconductor layer 20 can be similarly<br>
formed into an inclined surface not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at a pre-<br>
determined slope from the horizontal plane.<br>
[49]	That is, after the photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 50D on the P-type<br>
semiconductor layer 40 of Fig. 4 and light-exposed, a developed etching mask pattern<br>
is immediately formed without the hard-baking. The P-type semiconductor layer 40<br>
and the active layer 30, which are exposed through the etching mask pattern, are<br>
removed through an ICP (Inductive Coupled Plasma) or dry etching process to expose<br>
the N-type semiconductor layer 20. A portion of the exposed N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 20 may be further removed. Thereafter, if the etching mask pattern is removed, a<br>
light emitting device in which the side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 40,<br>
the active layer 30 and a portion of the N-type semiconductor layer 20 are not per-<br>
pendicular (90°) to but inclined at the predetermined slope from a horizontal plane can<br>
be manufactured as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
[50]	Alternatively, after a photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 50D on the P-<br>
type semiconductor layer 40 of Fig. 4 and light-exposed, hard-baking may be<br>
performed. In such a case, if the photoresist is hard-baked at a temperature of 100 to<br>
140°C and then developed, the side surface of the developed photoresist may be etched<br>
to have a slope of 80 to 20° from a horizontal plane. For example, in a case where the<br>
hard-baking is performed at a temperature of 100°C, an etching mask pattern with a<br>
slope of about 80° from the horizontal plane can be obtained, and the side surfaces of<br><br>
the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and a portion of the N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 20 can have a slope of about 80° from the horizontal plane using<br>
the etching mask pattern. Further, in a case where the hard-baking is performed at a<br>
temperature of 140°C, an etching mask pattern with a slope of about 20° from the<br>
horizontal plane can be obtained, and the side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 40, the active layer 30 and a portion of the N-type semiconductor layer 20 can<br>
have a slope of about 20° from the horizontal plane using the etching mask pattern.<br>
[51]	The etching mask pattern, which the photoresist with a thickness of 3 to 500 has<br>
been light-exposed and hard-baked at a temperature of 100 to 140°C and then<br>
developed in such a manner, can be used such that the side surfaces of the etched the<br>
P-type semiconductor layer 40, active layer 30 and predetermined N-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 20 have a slope of 80 to 20° from a horizontal plane similarly to the<br>
etching mask pattern. Then, light produced within a light emitting layer is not totally<br>
reflected on the etched side surface with a variety of slopes but emitted to the outside<br>
of a light emitting device.<br>
[52]	A transparent electrode layer may be further formed on the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 40 to reduce resistance of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and enhancing<br>
transmittance of light, and an additional ohmic metal layer may be further formed on<br>
the P-type semiconductor layer 40 or the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 20 to<br>
facilitate current supply. The transparent electrode layer may be made of ITO (Indium<br>
Tin Oxide), ZnO or a transparent conductive metal, and the ohmic metal layer may be<br>
made of Cr or Au. Further, for the application of voltage, a P-type electrode may be<br>
further formed on the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and an N-type electrode may be<br>
further formed on the N-type semiconductor layer 20.<br>
[53]	Further, in order to enhance the heat dissipation characteristic of a light emitting<br>
device, after a rear surface of the substrate 10 has been removed at a predetermined<br>
thickness, Al, Ti, Ag, W, Ni, Ta, Ru or an alloy thereof may be deposited on the rear<br>
surface of the substrate 10.<br>
[54]	As can be seen from this figure, a plurality of light emitting devices may be<br>
fabricated on a single substrate 10, which is cut into the individual light emitting<br>
devices. At this time, portions A. shown in Fig. 5 are cutting portions used for in-<br>
dividually cutting the plurality of light emitting devices.<br>
[55]	Accordingly, a light emitting device in which the side surfaces of the P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and a portion of the N-type semiconductor layer<br>
20 is not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at the predetermined slope from a<br>
horizontal plane can be manufactured.<br>
[56]	The aforementioned process of manufacturing a light emitting device according to<br>
the present invention is merely a specific embodiment, but is not limited thereto.<br><br>
Various processes and manufacturing methods may be modified or added depending<br>
on the characteristics of devices and the convenience of processes.<br>
[57]	Figs. 6 to 7 are sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a light<br>
emitting device according to a second embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[58]	The second embodiment of the present invention is almost the same as the first<br>
embodiment. In the second embodiment, however, there is provided a light emitting<br>
device in which a plurality of light emitting cells are connected in series, parallel or<br>
series-parallel in a wafer level to reduce the size of the device, and they can be driven<br>
at proper voltage and current to be used for illustration purpose and can also be driven<br>
even with an AC power source. Descriptions overlapping with the previous<br>
embodiment will be omitted herein.<br>
[59]	Referring to Fig. 6, an N-type semiconductor layer 20, an active layer 30 and a P-<br>
type semiconductor layer 40 are sequentially formed on a substrate 10 through various<br>
deposition methods including MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition),<br>
CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), PCVD (Plasma-enhanced Chemical Vapor<br>
Deposition), MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy), HVPE (Hybride Vapor Phase Epitaxy)<br>
and the like. A buffer layer may be further formed on the substrate 10 to reduce lattice<br>
mismatch between the substrate 10 and the subsequent layers upon growth of crystals.<br>
[60]	Thereafter, portions of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and the active layer 30<br>
are removed through a predetermined etching process to expose a portion of the N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 20. That is, after the photoresist has been applied at a thickness of<br>
3 to 50D on the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of Fig. 6 and light-exposed, it is<br>
developed without hard-baking to form an etching mask pattern. The P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 40 and the active layer 30, which are exposed through the etching<br>
mask pattern, are removed through an ICP (Inductive Coupled Plasma) or dry etching<br>
process to expose the N-type semiconductor layer 20. A portion of the exposed N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 20 may be further removed. Thereafter, if the etching mask<br>
pattern is removed, a light emitting device in which the side surfaces of the P-type<br>
semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and the N-type semiconductor layer 20 are<br>
not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at the predetermined slope from a horizontal<br>
plane can be manufactured as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
[61]	Alternatively, after a photoresist has been applied in a thickness of 3 to 50H on the<br>
P-type semiconductor layer 40 of Fig. 6 and light-exposed, it is hard-baked at a<br>
temperature of 100 to 140°C and developed such that an etching mask pattern can be<br>
formed. After the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and the active layer 30, which are<br>
exposed through the etching mask pattern, have been etched, the etching mask pattern<br>
is removed such that the side surfaces of the etched P-type semiconductor layer 40 and<br>
active layer 30 can have a variety of slopes of 80 to 20°.<br><br>
[62]	Next, in order to form a plurality of light emitting cells on the substrate 10, pre-<br>
determined regions of the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 20 are removed such<br>
that a portion of the substrate 10 can be exposed. To this end, a predetermined mask<br>
pattern is formed on all the portions except the predetermined regions where the<br>
substrate 10 will be exposed, and regions of the N-type semiconductor layer 20 that are<br>
exposed through the mask pattern are then etched such that the plurality of light<br>
emitting cells can be electrically isolated from one another as shown in Fig. 8. At this<br>
time, the mask pattern whose side surface is inclined through the aforementioned<br>
process is formed and then used to etch the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 20<br>
such that the side surface of the N-type semiconductor layer 20 in which the plurality<br>
of light emitting cells are separated from one another is not perpendicular to but<br>
inclined at a predetermineLi SxGpc ixcm a horizontal plane.<br>
[63J	Referring to Fig. 9, the N-type semiconductor layer 20 of a light emitting cell and<br>
the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of the adjacent light emitting cell are connected<br>
through a predetermined wiring process. That is, the exposed N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 20 of one light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of another<br>
adjacent light emitting cell are connected through a wire 60. At this time, the<br>
conductive wire 60 for electrically connecting the N-type and P-type semiconductor<br>
layers 20 and 40 are formed through a bridge process.<br>
[64]	The aforementioned bridge process is also called an air-bridge process. In the air-<br>
bridge process, a photosensitive liquid is applied between chips to be connected with<br>
each other through a photo process and developed to form a photoresist pattern, a<br>
material such as metal is first formed into a thin film on the photoresist pattern through<br>
a vacuum vapor deposition method or the like, and a conductive material containing<br>
gold (Au) is applied at a predetermined thickness onto the thin film through an elec-<br>
troplating, electroless plating or metal vapor deposition method. Thereafter, if the<br>
photoresist pattern is removed with a solution of a solvent or the like, a lower portion<br>
of the conductive material is completely removed, and thus, only the bridge-shaped<br>
conductive material is formed in a space between the adjacent light emitting cells.<br>
[65]	The wire 60 may be made of not only metal but also all kinds of conductive<br>
materials. It will be apparent that a silicone compound doped with impurities may be<br>
used.<br>
[66]	Further, in order to apply an external voltage to the light emitting device, a P-type<br>
bonding pad 50 is formed on the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of the light emitting<br>
cell positioned at one edge of the substrate 10 and an N-type bonding pad 55 is formed<br>
on the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 20 of the light emitting cell positioned at<br>
the other edge of the substrate 10.<br>
[67]	The aforementioned process of manufacturing a light emitting device according to<br><br>
the present invention is merely a specific embodiment but is not limited thereto.<br>
Various modifications can be made or various material films can be further added. For<br>
example, in order to enhance the heat dissipation characteristic of a light emitting<br>
device, after a rear surface of the substrate 10 has been removed at a predetermined<br>
thickness, Al, Ti, Ag, W, Ni, Ta, Ru or an alloy thereof may be deposited on the rear<br>
surface of the substrate 10.<br>
[68]	Accordingly, a light emitting device in which the plurality of light emitting cells<br>
each of which side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30<br>
and a portion of the N-type semiconductor layer 20 are not perpendicular (90°) to but<br>
inclined at predetermined slope from a horizontal plane are connected with one another<br>
can be manufactured.<br>
[69]	Figs. 10 to 13 are sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a light<br>
emitting device according to a third embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[70]	The third embodiment is almost the same as the second embodiment. In the second<br>
embodiment, the N-type semiconductor layer 20 is first exposed and a portion of the<br>
exposed N-type semiconductor layer 20 is then removed to separate the light emitting<br>
cells from one another. In the third embodiment, however, a plurality of light emitting<br>
cells are first separated, and a portion of an N-type semiconductor layer 20 is then<br>
exposed. Descriptions overlapping with the previous embodiments will be omitted<br>
herein.<br>
[71]	Referring to Fig. 10, portions of an N-type semiconductor layer 20, an active layer<br>
30 and a P-type semiconductor layer 40, which are sequentially formed on a substrate<br>
10, are removed to form a plurality of light emitting cells. To this end, after a<br>
photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 500 on the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 40 and light-exposed, it is immediately developed without hard-baking such that<br>
an etching mask pattern can be formed. The portions of the P-type semiconductor layer<br>
40, the active layer 30 and the N-type semiconductor pattern 20, which are exposed<br>
through the etching mask pattern, and the etching mask pattern is removed to separate<br>
the light emitting cells from one another. Accordingly, a light emitting device in which<br>
entire side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and the<br>
N-type semiconductor layer 20 are not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at a pre-<br>
determined slope can be obtained as shown in this figure. Further, the P-typc semi-<br>
conductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and the N-type semiconductor layer 20 are<br>
removed using the etching mask pattern in which a photoresist is applied at a thickness<br>
of 3 to 50D on the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and light-exposed and hard-baked at a<br>
temperature of 100 to 140°C and then developed. Accordingly, the entire side surfaces<br>
of the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30 and the N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 20 can be formed at various slopes of 80 to 20°.<br><br>
[72]	Thereafter, as shown in Fig. 11, portions of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and<br>
the active layer 30 are removed to expose a portion of the N-type semiconductor layer<br>
20 through a predetermined etching process.<br>
[73]	Referring to Fig. 12, the N-type semiconductor layer 20 of one light emitting cell<br>
and the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of another adjacent light emitting cell are<br>
connected with each other through a bridge process.<br>
[74]	Further, in order to apply an external voltage to the light emitting device, a P-type<br>
bonding pad 50 is formed on the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of the light emitting<br>
cell positioned at one edge of the substrate 10 and an N-type bonding pad 55 is formed<br>
on the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 20 of the light emitting cell positioned at<br>
the other edge of the substrate 10.	'<br>
[75]	The aforementioned process of manufacturing a light emitting device according to<br>
the present invention is merely a specific embodiment but is not limited thereto.<br>
Various modifications can be made and various material films may be further added.<br>
For example, in order to enhance the heat dissipation characteristic of a light emitting<br>
device, after a rear surface of the substrate 10 has been removed at a predetermined<br>
thickness, Al, Ti, Ag, W, Ni, Ta, Ru or an alloy thereof may be deposited on the rear<br>
surface of the substrate 10.<br>
[76]	Further, even in a case where the plurality of light emitting cells are separated by<br>
etching such that the side surfaces may have various slopes as shown in Fig. 10 and<br>
then etched to expose the N-type semiconductor layer 20, a light emitting device can<br>
be manufactured using the same etching process as described above. That is, as shown<br>
in Fig. 11, the side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 and the active layer<br>
30, which are etched to expose the N-type semiconductor layer 20, can be formed at<br>
various slopes.<br>
[77]	Accordingly, a light emitting device in which the plurality of light emitting cells<br>
each of which side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30<br>
and the N-type semiconductor layer 20 are not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at<br>
predetermined slope from a horizontal plane are connected with one another can be<br>
manufactured.<br>
[78]	Figs. 14 to 17 are sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a light<br>
emitting device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[79]	The fourth embodiment is almost the same as the third embodiment. In the third<br>
embodiment, a conductive wire for electrically connecting the N-type semiconductor<br>
layer of one light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer of another adjacent<br>
light emitting cell is formed through a bridge process. In the fourth embodiment,<br>
however, the conductive wire is formed through a step coverage process. Descriptions<br>
overlapping with the previous embodiments will be omitted herein.<br><br>
[80]	Referring to Fig. 14, even in a case where a plurality of light emitting cells are<br>
separated by etching such that the side surfaces may have various slopes and then<br>
etched to expose an N-type semiconductor layer 20 through the aforementioned<br>
process, the side surfaces of P-type semiconductor layer 40 and active layer 30, which<br>
are etched to expose the N-type semiconductor layer 20, are formed with various<br>
slopes. Further, in order to reduce the resistance of the P-type semiconductor layer 40<br>
and enhance the transmittance of light, a transparent electrode layer 85 may be further<br>
formed on a top surface of the P-type semiconductor layer 40. Further, an additional<br>
ohmic metal layer 87 for facilitating the supply of current may be further formed on a<br>
top surface of the P-type semiconductor layer 40 or the exposed N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 20. The transparent electrode layer 85 may be made of ITO (Indium Tin Oxide),<br>
ZnO or a conductive transparent metal, and the ohmic metal layer 87 may be made of<br>
Cr or Au.<br>
[81]	Referring to Fig. 15, a continuous insulation layer 70 is formed on an entire surface<br>
of the substrate 10 with the plurality of light emitting cells formed thereon. The<br>
insulation layer 70 covers the side surfaces and top surfaces of the light emitting cells<br>
and the top surfaces of the substrate 10 between the adjacent light emitting cells. For<br>
example, the insulation layer 70 may be formed as a silicone oxide film using a CVD<br>
(Chemical Vapor Deposition) technique.<br>
[82]	Since the side surfaces of the light emitting cells are inclined, the insulation layer 70<br>
can easily cover the side surfaces of the light emitting cells. Since the total thickness of<br>
the N-type semiconductor layer 20 and active layer 30 is small and spaces between the<br>
adjacent P-type semiconductor layers 40 are broad, the side surfaces of the P-type<br>
semiconductor layers 40 adjacent to the exposed regions of the N-type semiconductor<br>
layers 20 can be easily covered with the insulation layer 70.<br>
[83]	Referring to Fig. 16, an opening portion is formed on each of the exposed N-type<br>
and P-type semiconductor layers 20 and 40 of the light emitting cell by patterning the<br>
insulation layer 70 through a predetermined etching process. If the transparent<br>
electrode layer 85 and/or the ohmic metal layer 87 are formed as shown in this figure,<br>
the transparent electrode layer 85 and/or the ohmic metal layer 87 are exposed through<br>
the opening portion.<br>
[84]	Referring to Fig. 17, a wire 80 is formed on the insulation layer 70 with the opening<br>
portion. The wire 80 connects the N-type and P-type semiconductor layers 20 and 40<br>
through the opening portion thereof. That is, the N-type semiconductor layer 20 of one<br>
light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer 40 of another adjacent the light<br>
emitting cell are electrically connected with the wire.<br>
[85]	The wire 80 may be formed using a plating technique. That is, after an etching mask<br>
pattern with an opening portion defining a region of the wire 80 has been formed on<br><br>
the insulation layer 70 and a metal layer has been plated within the opening portion,<br>
the etching mask pattern is removed and thus the wire 80 can be formed.<br>
[86]	Further, the wire 80 may be formed using the CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) or<br>
PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) technique. That is, a metal layer is formed using a<br>
vapor deposition technique such as electron beam deposition and then patterned using<br>
a photo and etching process, so that the wire 80 can be formed. Since the side surface<br>
of the light emitting cell is inclined, the metal layer is continuously formed on the<br>
upper side surface of the light emitting cell.<br>
[87]	The light emitting device in which the wire 80 is formed as described above has an<br>
advantage in that it is possible to prevent the wire 80 from being disconnected or<br>
shorted due to external pressure and also prevent conductive materials such as metal,<br>
which remains while the wire 80 is formed, from shorting the light emitting cell.<br>
[88]	Accordingly, a light emitting device in which the plurality of light emitting cells<br>
each of which side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 40, the active layer 30<br>
and the N-type semiconductor layer 20 are not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at<br>
predetermined slope from a horizontal plane are connected with one another can be<br>
manufactured.<br>
[89]	As described above, the light emitting device according to the present invention is<br>
formed such that the side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer, the active layer<br>
and a portion of the N-type semiconductor layer are not perpendicular (90°) to but<br>
inclined at a predetermined slope from a horizontal plane. Therefore, luminous<br>
efficiency of the light emitting device of the present invention can be enhanced as<br>
compared with that of the conventional light emitting device. The reason is that a<br>
photon reflected on a flat surface in the prior art is not reflected on a surface with a<br>
different angle but emitted to the outside.<br>
[90]	Fig. 18 is a conceptual sectional view illustrating a light emitting device with a flip<br>
chip structure according to the present invention.<br>
[91]	Referring to Fig. 18, the light emitting device comprises a light emitting layer, i.e.<br>
an N-type semiconductor layer 120, an active layer 130 and a P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 140 sequentially formed on a base substrate 110. Further, the light emitting<br>
device comprises a submount substrate 200 onto which the base substrate 110 with the<br>
light emitting layer formed thereon is flip-chip bonded through metal bumps 150 and<br>
155. A side surface of the light emitting layer comprising the P-type semiconductor<br>
layer 140, the active layer 130 and the N-type semiconductor layer 120 is inclined at a<br>
slope of 20 to 80° from the horizontal plane and a critical angle of light is changed due<br>
to the side surface such that the light can be easily extracted. Therefore, luminous<br>
efficiency of the light emitting device can be improved.<br>
[92]	Figs. 19 to 23 are sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a light<br><br>
emitting device according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[93]	Referring to Fig. 19, an N-type semiconductor layer 120, an active layer 130 and a<br>
P-type semiconductor layer 140 are sequentially formed on a base substrate 110.<br>
[94]	The base substrate 110 refers to a general wafer used for fabricating a light emitting<br>
device is made of a transparent substrate such as Al O , ZnO and LiAl O In this<br>
2 3	2 3.<br>
embodiment, a crystal growth substrate made of sapphire is used.<br>
[95]	The N-type semiconductor layer 120, the active layer 130 and the P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 140 are sequentially formed on the substrate 110 through various<br>
deposition methods including MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition),<br>
CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), PCVD (Plasma-enhanced Chemical Vapor<br>
Deposition), MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy), HVPE (Hybride Vapor Phase Epitaxy)<br>
and the like. A buffer layer may be further formed on the substrate 110 to reduce<br>
lattice mismatch between the substrate 110 and the subsequent layers upon growth of<br>
crystals. The aforementioned components are the same as those in the previous em-<br>
bodiments, and thus, descriptions overlapping with the foregoing components will be<br>
omitted herein.<br>
[96]	Thereafter, portions of the P-type semiconductor layer 140 and the active layer 130<br>
are removed through a predetermined etching process to expose a portion of the N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 120. This etching process is the same as that of the previous em-<br>
bodiments.<br>
[97]	That is, after a photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 50D on the P-type<br>
semiconductor layer 140 of Fig. 19 and light-exposed, it is immediately developed<br>
without hard-baking to form an etching mask pattern. The P-type semiconductor 140<br>
and the active layer 130, which are exposed through the etching mask pattern, are<br>
removed through an ICP (Inductive Coupled Plasma) or dry etching process to expose<br>
the N-type semiconductor layer 120. Thereafter, if the etching mask pattern is<br>
removed, side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer 140 and the active layer 130<br>
which are not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at a predetermined slope from the<br>
horizontal plane can be obtained as shown in Fig. 20.<br>
[98]	Alternatively, after a photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 500 on the P-<br>
type semiconductor layer 140 of Fig. 19 and light-exposed, it is hard-baked at a<br>
temperature of 100 to 140°C and then developed such that an etching mask pattern can<br>
be formed. After the P-type semiconductor layer 140 and the active layer 130, which<br>
are exposed through the etching mask pattern, have been etched, the etching mask<br>
pattern is removed such that the side surfaces of the etched P-type semiconductor layer<br>
140 and active layer 130 can have a variety of slopes of 80 to 20°.<br>
[99]	A reflection layer for reflecting light may be further formed on a top surface of the<br>
P-type semiconductor layer 140, and an additional ohmic metal layer for facilitating<br><br>
the supply of current may be further formed on a top surface of the P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer 140 or the exposed N-type semiconductor layer 120. The ohmic metal<br>
layer may be made of Cr or Au.<br>
[100]	Further, P-type and N-type metal bumps 155 and 150 are formed on the P-type and<br>
N-type semiconductor layers 140 and 120, respectively, as shown in Fig. 21. Each of<br>
the P-type and N-type metal bumps 155 and 150 may be made of at least one material<br>
selected from the group consisting of Pb, Sn, Au, Ge, Cu, Bi, Cd, Zn, Ag, Ni, Ti and<br>
an alloy thereof. To this end, a photoresist is applied onto an entire structure and a<br>
photoresist pattern (not shown) through which portions of the P-type and N-type semi-<br>
conductor layers 140 and 120 are exposed is formed through a photo-etching process<br>
using a predetermined mask. After a metal film has been deposited on the entire<br>
structure, metal film portions formed on regions other than regions on the P-type and<br>
N-type semiconductor layers 140 exposed through the photoresist pattern and the<br>
photoresist pattern are removed. Accordingly, the P-type and N-type metal bumps 155<br>
and 150 are formed on the P-type and N-type semiconductor layers 140 and 120, re-<br>
spectively.<br>
[101]	Next, referring to Fig. 22, an additional submount substrate 200 is prepared to form<br>
P-type and N-type bonding pads 215 and 210 connected to the P-type and N-type metal<br>
bumps 155 and 150, respectively.<br>
[102]	At this time, various kinds of superior heat conductive substrates 200 are used as<br>
the submount substrate 200. That is, the submount substrate 200 may be made of SiC,<br>
Si, Ge, SiGe, A1N, metal or the like. In this embodiment, A1N with superior heat con-<br>
ductivity and insulation property is used. The present invention is not limited thereto,<br>
but a metallic material with superior heat and electric conductivity may be employed.<br>
In this case, an insulation or dielectric film is formed on the substrate 200 to suf-<br>
ficiently serve as an insulation. The dielectric film may be made of Si02, MgO and<br>
SiN or an insulating material. Further, each of the P-type and N-type bonding pads 210<br>
and 215 is made of a metal with superior electric conductivity. This is formed through<br>
a screen printing process or a deposition process using a predetermined mask pattern.<br>
[103]	Thereafter, the submount substrate 200 is flip-chip bonded onto the base substrate<br>
110 with the light emitting layer formed thereon.<br>
[104]	Referring to Fig. 23, in the light emitting device of the present invention, the N-type<br>
and P-type metal bumps 150 and 155 formed on the top of the light emitting layer are<br>
bonded and connected with the N-type and P-type bonding pads 210 and 215 of the<br>
submount substrate 200, respectively. At this time, the bonding pads and metal bumps<br>
may be bonded using heat or ultrasonic waves or simultaneously using the heat and<br>
ultrasonic waves. The metal bumps 150 and 155 and the lower bonding pads 210 and<br>
215 are connected through a variety of bonding methods.<br><br>
[105]	Moreover, the N-type and P-type metal bumps 150 and 155 are not formed on the<br>
top of the light emitting layer but may be formed on the submount substrate 200.<br>
[106]	As can be seen from this figure, a plurality of light emitting devices may be<br>
fabricated on a single substrate 10, which is cut into the individual light emitting<br>
devices. At this time, portions A shown in Fig. 23 are cutting portions used for in-<br>
dividually cutting the plurality of light emitting devices.<br>
[107]	The aforementioned process of manufacturing a light emitting device according to<br>
the present invention is merely a specific embodiment, but is not limited thereto.<br>
Various processes and manufacturing methods may be modified or added depending<br>
on the characteristics of devices and the convenience of processes. For example, in the<br>
same process as the previous embodiments, the base substrate with the N-type semi-<br>
conductor layer, the active layer and the P-type semiconductor layer sequentially<br>
formed thereon is prepared as shown in Fig. 19. Then, portions of the P-type semi-<br>
conductor layer, the active layer and the N-type semiconductor layer are first removed<br>
to expose the substrate such that the plurality of light emitting devices can be in-<br>
dividually isolated. At this time, the side surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer,<br>
the active layer and the N-type semiconductor layer, which are etched through the<br>
aforementioned process, may be formed not to be perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at<br>
a predetermined slope.<br>
[108]	Accordingly, a light emitting device with a flip chip structure, in which the side<br>
surfaces of the P-type semiconductor layer, the active layer and a portion of the N-type<br>
semiconductor layer are not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at the predetermined<br>
slope from the horizontal plane, can be manufactured.<br>
[109]	Figs. 24 to 28 are sectional views illustrating a process of manufacturing a light<br>
emitting device according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[110]	The sixth embodiment is almost the same as the fifth embodiment. In the sixth<br>
embodiment, however, there is provided a light emitting device with a flip chip<br>
structure, in which a plurality of light emitting cells are connected in series, parallel or<br>
series-parallel in a wafer level to reduce the size of the device, and they can be driven<br>
at proper voltage and current to be used for illumination purpose and can also be<br>
driven even with an AC power source. Descriptions overlapping with the previous em-<br>
bodiments will be omitted herein.<br>
[Ill]	Referring to Fig. 24, an N-type semiconductor layer 120, an active layer 130 and a<br>
P-type semiconductor layer 140 are sequentially formed on a base substrate 110<br>
through various deposition methods including MOCVD (Metal Organic Chemical<br>
Vapor Deposition), CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition), PCVD (Plasma-enhanced<br>
Chemical Vapor Deposition), MBE (Molecular Beam Epitaxy), HVPE (Hybride Vapor<br>
Phase Epitaxy) and the like. A buffer layer may be further formed on the substrate 110<br><br>
to reduce lattice mismatch between the substrate 110 and the subsequent layers upon<br>
growth of crystals.<br>
[112]	Thereafter, portions of the N-type semiconductor layer 120, the active layer 130<br>
and the P-type semiconductor layer 140, which are sequentially formed on the base<br>
substrate 110, are removed to form a plurality of light emitting cells. To this end, after<br>
a photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 50D on the P-typc semiconductor<br>
layer 140 of Fig. 24 and light-exposed, it is immediately developed without hard-<br>
baking to form an etching mask pattern. The P-type semiconductor 140, the active<br>
layer 130 and the predetermined N-type semiconductor layer 120, which are exposed<br>
through the etching mask pattern, are removed through an ICP (Inductive Coupled<br>
Plasma) or dry etching process to separate the light emitting cells from one another.<br>
Next, if the etching mask pattern is removed, a light emitting device in which entire<br>
side surfaces of the etched P-type semiconductor layer 140, active layer 130 and N-<br>
type semiconductor layer 120 are not perpendicular (90°) to but inclined at a pre-<br>
determined slope from the horizontal plane can be obtained as shown in Fig. 25.<br>
[113]	Alternatively, after a photoresist has been applied at a thickness of 3 to 50D on the P-<br>
type semiconductor layer 140 of Fig. 24 and light-exposed, it is hard-baked at a<br>
temperature of 100 to 140°C and developed such that an etching mask pattern can be<br>
formed. After the P-type semiconductor layer 140, the active layer 130 and the N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 120, which are exposed through the etching mask pattern, have<br>
been etched, the etching mask pattern is removed such that the side surfaces of the<br>
etched P-type semiconductor layer 140 and active layer 130 can be inclined at various<br>
slopes of 80 to 20°.<br>
[114]	Next, portions of the P-type semiconductor layer 140 and the active layer 130 are<br>
removed through a predetermined etching process to expose a portion of the N-type<br>
semiconductor layer 120, as shown in Fig. 26. The exposed N-type semiconductor<br>
layer 120 of one light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer 140 of another<br>
adjacent light emitting cell are connected with each other through a predetermined<br>
conductive wire. At this time, a bridge wire 160 is made of a conductive material, e.g.<br>
metal. It will be apparent that the bridge wire 160 may be made of a silicone<br>
compound doped with impurities. The bridge wire 160 is formed through a bridge<br>
process.<br>
[115]	Further, a plurality of metal bumps are formed on the top of the light emitting cells,<br>
and P-lype and N-type metal bumps 155 and 150 are further formed on the P-lype<br>
semiconductor layer 140 of the light emitting cell positioned at one edge of the<br>
substrate 110 and the N-type semiconductor layer 120 of the light emitting cell<br>
positioned the other edge of the substrate, respectively.<br>
[116]	Next, as shown in Fig. 27, an additional submount substrate 200 is prepared, on<br><br>
which a plurality of bonding layers 220, a P-type bonding pad 215 positioned at one<br>
edge of the submount substrate 200 and an N-type bonding pad 210 positioned at the<br>
other edge of the submount substrate are formed.<br>
[ 117]	Thereafter, as can be shown in Fig. 28, the aforementioned base substrate 110 with<br>
the plurality of light emitting cells formed thereon is flip-chip bonded onto the<br>
submount substrate 200 to fabricate the light emitting device. The substrates are<br>
bonded with each other through the metal bumps 150 and 155 formed on the top of the<br>
light emitting cell and the bonding layers 220 formed on the submount substrate 200,<br>
respectively. The P-type bonding pad 215 positioned at one edge of the submount<br>
substrate 200 is connected to the P-type metal bump 155 of the light emitting cell<br>
positioned at one edge of the base substrate 110, whereas the N-type bonding pad 210<br>
nnsitinned at the. other edpe of the submount substrate 200 is connected to the N-tVDe<br>
metal bump 150 of the light emitting cell positioned at the other edge of the base<br>
substrate 110.<br>
[118]	The aforementioned process of manufacturing a light emitting device according to<br>
the present invention is merely a specific embodiment, but is not limited thereto.<br>
Various processes and manufacturing methods may be modified or added depending<br>
on the characteristics of devices and the convenience of processes. For example, in this<br>
embodiment, the conductive wire for electrically connecting the N-type semiconductor<br>
layer of one light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer of another adjacent<br>
light emitting cell is formed through a bridge process, and the base substrate is then<br>
flip-chip bonded onto the submount substrate. However, the present invention is not<br>
limited thereto. That is, a conductive wire for electrically connecting the N-type semi-<br>
conductor layer of one light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer of<br>
another adjacent light emitting cells may be formed through a step coverage process<br>
which is the same as in the fourth embodiment. Further, an electrode layer may be<br>
formed on the submount substrate when the plurality of light emitting cells are flip-<br>
chip bonded onto the submount substrate such that the N-type semiconductor layer of<br>
one light emitting cell and the P-type semiconductor layer of another adjacent light<br>
emitting cell are electrically connected through the metal bumps.<br>
[119]	Accordingly, a light emitting device in which a plurality of flip chip light emitting<br>
cells each having a side surface of a light emitting layer, which is not perpendicular<br>
(90°) to but inclined at a predetermined slope from the horizontal plane, are arrayed on<br>
the submount substrate can be manufactured. The light emitting cells may be<br>
connected in various ways, i.e. in series, parallel or series-parallel, depending on the<br>
desired purpose.<br>
[120]	Fig. 29 is a sectional view showing a seventh embodiment according to the present<br>
invention.<br><br>
[121]	The seventh embodiment is almost the same as the sixth embodiment. In this<br>
embodiment, even in a case where a plurality of light emitting cells are separated by<br>
etching such that the side surfaces may have slopes as shown in Fig. 25 and then<br>
etched to expose an N-type semiconductor layer, a light emitting device can be man-<br>
ufactured using the same etching process as the previous embodiment. That is, side<br>
surfaces of a P-type semiconductor layer 140 and an active layer 130 etched to expose<br>
an N-type semiconductor layer 120 are formed with various slopes, as shown in Fig.<br>
29.<br>
[122]	Accordingly, a light emitting device in which a plurality of flip chip light emitting<br>
cells each having an entire side surface of a light emitting layer, which is not per-<br>
pendicular (90°) to but inclined at a predetermined slope from the horizontal plane, are<br>
arrayed on the subrnount substrate can be manufactured. The light emitting cells may<br>
be connected in various ways, i.e. in series, parallel or series-parallel, depending on the<br>
desired purpose.<br>
[123]	As described above, the light emitting device with a flip chip structure according to<br>
the present invention is formed such that some side surfaces of a light emitting layer<br>
are not particular (90°) to but inclined at a predetermined slope from the horizontal<br>
plane. Therefore, luminous efficiency of the light emitting device of the present<br>
invention can be enhanced as compared with that of the conventional light emitting<br>
device. The reason is that a photon reflected on a flat surface in the prior art is not<br>
reflected on a surface with a different angle but emitted to the outside.<br>
[124]	Figs. 30 and 31 are conceptual sectional views illustrating a difference between<br>
effects of the light emitting devices according to the prior art and the present invention.<br>
[125]	The light efficiency of a light emitting device may be expressed as internal quantum<br>
efficiency and external quantum efficiency, and the internal quantum efficiency is<br>
determined in accordance with the design and quality of an active layer. The external<br>
quantum efficiency is determined in accordance with a degree where a photon<br>
produced in an active layer is emitted to the outside of a light emitting device.<br>
Referring to Fig. 30 in which a conventional light emitting device is shown, a side<br>
surface of a semiconductor layer is formed perpendicular to a horizontal plane. In such<br>
a case, some portions of photons are not penetrated through the side surface of the<br>
semiconductor layer but reflected thereon, and totally reflected light is not emitted to<br>
the outside but dissipated within the light emitting device. However, referring to Fig.<br>
31 in which a light emitting device according to the present invention is shown, a side<br>
surface of a semiconductor layer is not perpendicular to but inclined at a predetermined<br>
slope from a horizontal plane. In such a case, the inclined side surface makes a critical<br>
angle of light change to help the light to be more easily extracted. Therefore, light<br>
generated in an active layer is not totally reflected but emitted to the outside of the<br><br>
light emitting device such that external quantum efficiency can be markedly enhanced.<br>
[126]	Although the present invention has been described in detail in connection with the<br>
specific embodiments, it will be readily understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various modifications and changes can be made thereto within the technical spirit and<br>
scope of the present invention. It is also apparent that the modifications and changes<br>
fall within the scope of the present invention defined by the appended claims.<br>
