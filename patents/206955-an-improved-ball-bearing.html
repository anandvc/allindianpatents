COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(Section 10)<br>
"AN IMPROVED BALL BEARING"<br>
VASANT VYANKATESH APTE, 2/25, Vishnu Prasad, MG.Road, Vile Parle (East),<br>
MUMBAI-400 057 Maharashtra State, India An Indian National<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
Present invention relates to high-speed ball bearings. More particularly present invention relates to high-speed ball bearings to maintain heat generation within permissible limits, when run at very high speeds.<br>
In prior art normally angular contact bearings are used for high-speed applications, where the contact angle is maintained at about 15째 against a normal angle of about 41째. In order to reduce heat generation, maintaining die angle at about 15째, instead of about 41째 reduces the surface contact area. Reduction in angle in turn leads to reduced load carrying capacity of the ball bearing. A careful study of the geometry of the ball bearings and the surfaces in contact with the balls, reveal, that this change in the contact angle results in the reduction of the contact area of the ball with the ball races.<br>
The said ball races are manufactured to follow the spherical shape of the balls and therefore the bafls are in full contact with the ball race. The depth of the grove of the ball race decides the angle of contact. Greater depth of grove leads to greater angle of contact, which in turn leads to greater surface contact area resulting in greater heat generation.<br>
Therefore if the speed of the bearing is to be further increased, it automatically follows that the area in contact between the balls and ball races is further reduced, so that the temperature rise and in turn the heat generation is maintained within allowable limits.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop high-speed ball bearings to maintain heat generation within permissible limits, when run at very high speeds.<br>
It is also an object of this invention to reduce the contact area of the balls with the ball races, by incorporating a non angular groove as a ball race, instead<br>
2<br><br>
of a circular shaped groove which follows the contour of the balls and is in fuil contact with the balls.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to overcome the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
According to this invention, therefore, a high speed ball bearing comprising of an outer ring, inner ring and balls placed in between the said outer ring and inner ring with spacers in between the said balls, characterized in that the said outer ring and inner ring being provided with a non circular groove reducing the contact area between the said balls and the said rings resulting in reducing the amount of heat generated at high speeds.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the drawings of the accompanying specification where salient features have been shown by suitable numerals and referred to appropriately in the following description.<br>
Drawing consists of 6 figures: -<br>
Figure 1 shows a cross section of the outer ring of the conventional ball bearings having a circular groove.<br>
Figure 2 shows a cross section of the inner ring of the conventional ball bearings having a circular groove.<br>
Figure 3 shows a cross section of a conventional ball bearing assembly having an angular contact bearing.<br>
Figures 4, 5 and 6 show a cross section of an assembly of an angular contact bearing according to this invention.<br>
3<br><br>
Refer to figures 1 and 2 which show the outer ring (1) and inner (3) ring having circular groove (2 and 4) respectively.<br>
Refer to fig. 3 whieh shows a cross section of a conventional ball bearing assembly having an angular contact bearing comprising an outer ring (1) having circular groove (2) on the inside diameter of the said outer ring (1), the inner ring (3) having circular groove (4) on the outside diameter of the said inner ring (3) forming an annular groove (5) with a spherical ball (6) placed in the said annular groove (5). The circular shaped groove (2,4) of these rings (1,3) is machined to precisely follow the contour of spherical shaped balls.<br>
The outer ring (1) with the circular groove (2) and the inner ring (3) with the circular groove (4) are so dimensioned that when these rings (1,3) are assembled, the grooves (2,4) face each other to form a perfect round annular hollow groove (5) to allow spherical ball (6) to be inserted within the grooves.<br>
The clearance between the spherical ball (6) and the grooves (2,4) is so maintained as to allow one ring to rotate with respect to the other ring without any undesirable play.<br>
As one ring is rotated with respect to the other ring, the ball (6) and the grooves (2,4) come in line contact with each other and because of friction between these surfaces, heat is generated.<br>
To reduce the friction and ultimately the heat generation, these surfaces which are coming in contact with each other are precisely ground and are lubricated.<br>
Inspite of all the care taken in the manufacture of these bearings; and various precautions in assembly, proper lubrication, etc. these surfaces do come in contact with each other when subjected to high loads and/or high speeds.<br>
4<br><br>
Referring to figures 4, 5 and 6 which show a cross section of an assembly of an angular contact bearing according to this invention, mainly comprises the adjusting features of the conventional ball bearing with modification carried out by virtue of a non circular groove (7, 8) for outer and inner ring (1, 3). Figure 4 is shown to comprise outer ring (1) having Non Circular groove (7). Figure 5 is shown to comprise inner ring (3) having Non Circular groove (8) and figure 6 is shown to comprise outer and inner ring (1 and 3) having Non Circular groove (7 and 8)<br>
The Non Circular groove will have only a two point contact (9) with the balls (6) instead of a line contact of the circular groove as seen in figure 3. This arrangement will reduce the contact area to a very great extent and thus will help in maintaining the temperature rise and subsequently the heat generation within permissible limits, even at very high speeds.<br>
The drawings accompanying the specification pertain to some of the possibilities of a non-circular groove and by no means are limited to what is shown in the figures.<br>
5<br><br>

1.	An improved ball bearing comprising an outer ring, inner ring and balls placed in between the said outer ring and inner ring with spacers in between the said balls, characterized in that the said outer race and inner race being provided with a non circular groove reducing the contact area between the said balls and the said races resulting in reducing the amount of heat generated at high speeds.<br>
