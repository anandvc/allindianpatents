				<td>SELECTIVE CATALYST REDUCTION OF NITROGEN OXIDES WITH HYDROGEN<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to the catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Nitrogen oxides, in particular NO and NO2 (NO*), resulting from combustion processes continue to be a major source of air pollution. They contribute to photochemical smog, acid rain, ozone depletion, ground level ozone, and greenhouse effects. More than 95% of nitrogen oxide emissions are derived from two sources: -49% from mobile sources, such as vehicles, and ~46% from stationary sources, such as power plants. Many technologies have been developed in an attempt to decrease such emissions.<br>
[0003] Three-way catalysis is very effective for removing emissions from gasoline engines, where narrow band oxygen sensors afford closed loop control with an air fuel ratio of about 14.07, Diesel engines, on the other hand, operate very lean and with a wide-band air fuel ratio of about 14 to about 24. While diesel engines have considerable benefits to gasoline engines, due to the nature of diesel fuel and the compression ignition combustion process, diesel engines emit a high quantity of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions. Many catalysts useful for gasoline engines are not suitable for use in a diesel engine exhaust stream as a wider operating temperature window is required.<br>
[0004] The current commercially available technology for reducing NOx emissions from stationary sources is selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Ammonia (NH3) is widely accepted as the reducing agent of choice. Similar SCR technology Is also effectively applied to mobile sources, where NH3 is usually generated by the thermal decomposition of urea. However, there are many commercial and logistical drawbacks, namely: (1) a separate tank and injection system is required, (2) several issues exist relating to NH3 slip, (3) the difficulty of handling urea solutions during cold conditions, and (4) as of yet, no real infrastructure exists to widely deploy the necessary urea solution. These factors indicate the desirability of the development of an active NOx reduction<br>
catalyst that makes use of other reductants, such as hydrogen. Hydrogen has been shown to be a promising reductant for NOx under lean bum conditions and will most likely be available in automobiles from fuel processors for fuel cell applications, on-board reforming of diesel fuel, or the like.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] The present invention provides an emissions treatment system and methods for reducing contaminants in diesel exhaust streams containing nitrous oxides (NOx). The system includes a catalytic, converter having at least one inlet, at least one outlet, and an interior working environment adapted to receive and dispel exhaust A catalyst is disposed in the interior working environment and comprises a compound represented by the formula; X% Pd -Y% V2O5 / Z, where X is a weight percent between about 0.1 to about 2.0, Y is a weight percent between about 0.1 to about 7.0, and Z is a high surface area support material. A reducing agent is provided comprising H2 and CO at a ratio of H2: CO from about 1:1 to about 3:1. The reducing agent is mixed with diesel engine exhaust and the mixture is injected into the interior working environment of the converter where the catalyst reduces NOx present in the exhaust.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS [0025]     The following description of the preferred embodiment(s) is merely exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application, or uses.<br>
[0026] The present invention relates to an emissions treatment system for reducing contaminants in diesel exhaust streams containing nitrous oxides (NOx). While the decomposition of NOx to innocuous components is thermodynamically favored with the temperatures and pressures affiliated with diesel exhaust, the reactions are inhibited by high activation energies and require a catalyst to facilitate the decomposition. As is widely known, however, the performance of many catalysts deteriorates in the presence of oxygen. Various catalysts have been used to decompose NOx and include precious metals, metallic oxides, zeolites, and similar materials fixed to a suitable earner. The present invention is directed to the novel use of selective catalytic reduction of NOx with hydrogen (H2-SCR) using palladium. In preferred embodiments, the catalyst reduces the NOx in-situ, and not as part of a NOx adsorbing reaction.<br>
[0027] In various embodiments, the present invention provides an emissions system and methods of reducing NOx in lean-burn diesel engine exhaust. The system is operable throughout the wide range of normal operating temperatures of diesel engines, typically between about 125 to about 650°C, and has an efficiency of greater than about 87%, more preferably, greater than about 95%. In various embodiments, the system operates with the exhaust having a flow rate of between about 200 and about 700 kg/hr, and a space velocity through the interior working environment of between about 9,000 and about 70,000 hr1.<br>
[0028] The system of the present invention includes a catalytic converter having at least one inlet, an outlet, and an interior working environment adapted to receive and dispel an exhaust. A catalyst is disposed in the interior working environment and comprises a compound represented by the formula: X% Pd - Y% V2O5 / Z, where X is a weight percent between about 0.1 to about 2.0, Y is a weight percent between about 0.1 to about 7.0, and Z is a high surface area support material. The catalyst is incorporated into the exhaust system at such a position that yields optimum efficiencies with a fast light-off time period.<br>
 [0029] The support for the catalyst typically comprises a high surface area refractory metal oxide. Dispersed within the oxide layer is the palladium metal component. Without being bound by theory, the palladium promotes the oxidation and reduction of nitrogen species and is present in an amount of between about 0.1 to about 2% by weight of the catalyst. The catalyst coating thickness and supporting materials will vary according to the targeted reduction of NO* Non-limiting examples of suitable oxide support materials include alumina, titania, zirconia; mixtures of alumina with one or more of titania, zirconia, and ceria,' ceria coated on alumina; and titania coated on alumina. The metal oxide may also comprise a mixed oxide, such as silica-alumina, amorphous or crystalline aluminosilicates, alumina-zirconia, alumina chromia, and alumina ceria. Presently preferred metal oxides include gamma alumina and titania coated on alumina. In certain embodiments, the support material comprises a pillared interlayered clay (PILC), such as Ti-PILC. In various embodiments, the catalyst further comprises at least one promoter. Non-limiting examples of suitable promoters include: Ce, Mn, Zr, La, Gd, Nb, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and combinations thereof. Typically, the promoter, if any, is present in an amount between about 0.01 and about 20% by weight of the catalyst.<br>
[0030] In various embodiments, the metal oxide will have a surface area of from about 50 to about 300 rrf/g or more. In presently preferred embodiments, the oxide support material is present in an amount having a loading per unit volume of between about 0.5 to about 10 g/in3. As should be understood to those skilled in the art the ratio of substrate length to diameter, or frontal surface area to volume, should be optimized based on the exhaust flow rate and the targeted NO* reduction.<br>
[0031] The SCR catalyst of the present invention can be in the form of self supporting catalyst particles, for example as a packed bed, or the catalyst can be supported on a metal or ceramic honeycomb structure, or the like. In other embodiments, the catalyst composition can be disposed as a washcoat or as a combination of washcoats on a ceramic or metallic substrate.<br>
[0032] A reducing agent comprising H2 and CO is provided to assist in the reduction reactions. In presently preferred embodiments, the reducing agent<br>
comprises a ratio of H2: CO of from about 1:1 to about 3:1, with the latter more preferable. In certain embodiments, hydrocarbons can be used in addition to or in place of the CO. The reducing agent is mixed with diesel engine exhaust and the mixture is injected into the interior working environment for the catalyst to reduce the nitrous oxides present in the exhaust In certain embodiments, a mixing element is provided having a first input coupled to a reducing agent source, a second input coupled for receipt of diesel engine exhaust, and at least one output. The diesel engine exhaust mixed with the reducing agent is injected into the interior working environment of the converter where the catalyst reduces nitrous oxides present in the exhaust In various embodiments, the reducing agent is in the form a reducing fuel that is produced on-board a vehicle. In this instance, a fuel reformer is provided to convert a sufficient amount of diesel fuel, oxygen, and moisture into H2 and CO. In other embodiments, H2 may also be provided from other sources, such as from a fuel cell application.<br>
Catalyst Preparation and Activity Measurement<br>
[0033] A 20 wt% TiO2on--Al2O3 support is prepared by the hydrolysis of a solution of Ti[O(CH2)3CH3]4 in the presence of -Al2O3 (PSD-350 grade from Aluminum Company of America, BET surface area of approximately 350 m2/g, 60-100 mesh). The solid sample is dried in air at about 500°C for about 6 hours. A 5%V2O5/ 20 wt% TiO2-γ-Al2O3 is prepared by impregnation in 20%TiO2--Al2O33 with an aqueous solution of NH4VO3 in oxalic acid. A similar procedure is used to prepare 5%V2O5/Al2O3 and 5%V20i/TiO2 (P25, Degussa, BET surface area of 30.6 m2/g). After impregnation, the catalysts are dried at about 120°C for about 12 hours and calcined at about 500°C in oxygen for about 12 hours to decompose the ammonium salt into the corresponding oxide. Palladium is subsequently impregnated in 5%V2O5/ 20 wt% TiO2-Al2O3 and 20 wt% TiO2-y-AI2O3 using a Pd(NH3)4CI2 aqueous solution. The catalyst is dried at about 120°C for about 12 hours and calcined at about 500°C for about 6 hours in oxygen.<br>
[0034] The catalytic activity measurements according to the present invention are carried out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor. A typical reactant gas composition comprises: 500 ppm NO, 4000 ppm H2, 0-2000 ppm CO (when<br>
used), 5% 02, and the balance He. A 100 mg sample is used in each run. The total flow rate is about 200 ml/min (under ambient conditions). Premixed gases (1.01% NO in He, 5.00% H2 in He, and 1.0% CO in He) are readily available from Matheson Tri-Gas of Irving, Texas. Water vapor is generated by passing He through a heated saturator containing de-ionized water. The NO and N02 concentrations are continually monitored using a chemiluminescent NO/NOx analyzer (for example, Thermo Environmental Instruments, Inc., Model 42C). The products are analyzed using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, 8A) with a 13X molecular sieve column for H2, CO, and N2 separation and Porapak Q column for N2O. Ammonia formation is monitored by FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy). Typically, no ammonia is detected by FTIR in the lean bum conditions. The catalytic activity is based on the calculated N0X conversion using the following formula.<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The N2 selectivity is calculated as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [0035] Since. the reactions are earned out- at relatively low temperatures, part of the decrease in NO concentration can be attributed to the adsorption of NO onto the catalysts. Thus, to minimize this occurrence, the following is done at the beginning of each example: the catalyst is first purged with reactant gas until the inlet and outlet NO concentrations are equal (i.e., about 500 ppm). The temperature is subsequently raised to the desired level. At each reaction temperature, the NO conversion and product analysis is performed after allowing the reaction to reach steady state (about 1-2 hours, depending on the reaction).<br>
[0036] The nitrogen balance is calculated for each step using the following equation: inlet [NO] = outlet [NO] + [N2] + [N20]. Steady-state kinetic studies for the NO reduction by H2 in the presence of CO and O2 are carried out for the 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst making use of a fixed-bed, quartz flow<br>
reactor, with 5 mg of catalyst used in each run. The NO concentration in an exhaust is simulated by blending different gaseous reactants. The typical reactant gas composition is as follows: 0-5000 ppm H2l 100-500 ppm NO, 0-500 ppm CO, 1-5% 02, and the balance He. The total flow rate is about 500 ml/min (under ambient conditions). The same instrumentation, as described above, is used throughout.<br>
Catalyst Characterization<br>
[0037] Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements are carried out on the catalysts of the present invention using a Rigaku Rotaflex D/Max-C system with a Cu Koc (K = 0.1543 nm) radiation source. The samples are loaded with a depth of 1 mm. In each H2-TPR (temperature-programmed reduction) experiment, a 50 mg sample is loaded into a quartz reactor and pretreated with an Oa/He (100 ml/min) flow at about 500°C for about 0.5 hours. The sample is cooled to room temperature in an Oa/He flow. The reduction of the sample is carried out starting at room temperature to about 600°C in a 5.32% H2/N2 flow (of about 40 ml/min) with a temperature ramp of about 10°C/min. The consumption of H2 is monitored with the use of a thermal conductivity detector. Water produced during the reduction is trapped in a 5 A° molecular sieve column.<br>
[0038] Infrared spectra are recorded on a Nicolet Impact 400 FTIR spectrometer with a TGS detector. The samples are prepared as a self-supporting wafer of 1.3 cm diameter. This is achieved by compressing 15 mg of the sample. The wafer is loaded into the IR cell (BaF2 windows). The wafers are pre-treated at 573 K in a flow of high purity Oa/He for about ½hour and stepwise cooled to room temperature. At each temperature step, the background spectrum is recorded in flowing Oa/He. This spectrum is subsequently subtracted from the sample spectrum obtained at the same temperature step. Thus, the IR absorption features that originated from the structure vibrations of the catalyst are eliminated from the sample spectra. IR spectra are recorded by accumulating 100 scans at a spectra resolution of 4 cm'1.<br>
[0039] The XRD patterns of the catalysts are shown in Figure 1. Crystalline PdO phases are nof*detected in all samples, which indicates that Pd<br>
is highly dispersed on the support. Four diffraction peaks with 29 = 25.3, 37.5, 39.4 and 48 respectively, are observed in the titania containing samples. These peaks originate from the anatase form of titania.<br>
[0040] H2-TPR profiles of 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 and r/oPdffiCV AL2O3 catalysts prepared are shown in Figure 2. All samples show one main peak, which can be assigned to the reduction of Pd (II) to Pd (0). For the V2O5 containing sample, the reduction peak temperature is 46°C higher than that on V2O5-free sample. While not being bound by theory, it is believed that the presence of V2O5 retards the reduction of Pd oxides.<br>
NOx reduction on Pd based catalysis by H2 in the presence of oxygen<br>
[0041] The performance of a range of Pd-based catalysts is shown in Figure 3. A maximum NO conversion of 98% is achieved at about 150°C over a 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst This reaction displays only one NO conversion peak. Under the same conditions, a 1%Pd/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst also shows a high NO conversion. However, two separate NO conversion peaks are observed at 150°C and 240°C, respectively. While a maximum NO conversion of 80% is obtained over the 5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst, the peak conversion temperature Is the same as the second NO conversion peak for the 1%Pd/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst. This may indicate that the second NO conversion peak may not depend on the Pd concentration. From Figure 3, it can be seen that the addition of V2O5 to the 1%Pd/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst increases the NO conversion, especially at temperatures of around 200°C. Thus, the addition of V2O5 widens the high NO conversion temperature window to 140-250°C (with about 80% NO conversion). The 1%Pd/Ti02/AI203 catalyst exhibits a narrower NO conversion temperature window of 140°C - 180°C. Based on the investigated temperature range, the NO conversion order is as follows: 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 &gt; 1%Pd/Ti02/AI203 &gt; 5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3.<br>
[0042] Figure 4 illustrates hydrogen conversions as a function of temperature on various TKVAI^ supported catalysts. The H2 conversion for each catalyst reaches 100% at the temperatures where the maximum NO conversion is observed. On the 1%Pd/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst, this is achieved at a<br>
temperature of 150°C. While for the 1%P^5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst, 98% H2 conversion is reached at 150°C. The 5%V20/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst, on the other hand, reaches complete hfe conversion only at 240°C.<br>
[0043] For the presently preferred catalyst, 1%Pd-5%V2O3/TiO2/Al2O3 the NO-H2-O2 reaction activities including NO conversion, H2 conversion, and N2 selectivity, at various space velocities are shown in Figure 5. Generally, the space velocity significantly influences the low temperature NO conversion, not the NO conversion in the high temperature range. As the space velocity is increased (1.0x10s to 1.8 x 108 h'1), the NO conversion decreases, and NO conversion maximum shifts toward a higher temperature (about 150°C - 200°C). Hs conversion exhibits a similar trend, namely as the space velocity increases, H2 conversion decreases. The corresponding 100% H2 conversion temperature also increases. No significant space velocity effects are visible on the N2 selectivity at temperatures below 200°C. A significant decrease in N2 selectivity is observed in the temperature range 2006C - 300°C.<br>
[0044] Figure 6 shows the conversions of NO and H2, as well as the N2 selectivity of various supported Pd catalysts as a function of temperature. As shown, at low temperatures (i.e., less than about 170°C), the 1%Pd-5%V2O5TiO2catalyst has a very low activity, while 1%Pd-5%V20s/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst and 1%Pd-5%V2O3/Al2O3catalyst display relatively high activities under the same conditions.<br>
[0045] In the high temperature range (i.e., greater than about 240°C), all of the samples show similar activities. The order of increasing activity of these Pd based catalysts is: 1%Pd-5%V20«/TiO2/Al2O3&gt; 1%Pd-5%TiO2/Al2O3 &gt; 1%Pd-5%V2O3/TiO2. The same trend is observed for Hz conversion. The N2 selectivity of different catalysts is also shown in Figure 6; all samples show a similar N2 selectivity.<br>
[0046] Figure 7 illustrates the NO conversion as a function of reaction time for catalysts 1%Pd-5%V2O3/Al2O3 (at 150°C and 170°C) and 1%Pd-5%V20s/TiO2/Al2O3 (at 150°C). At 150°C, the 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2/Al2O3 catalyst has a high NO conversion rate to reach steady state in only 1 hour. A similar trend Is observed for the ^%Pd-5%V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst at 170°C. At<br>
150°C, however, the 1%Pd-5%V2O5/Al2O3 catalyst displays a slow NO conversion rate and only reaches 60% NO conversion after three hours. The 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2-AI203 catalyst has a higher conversion rate, indicating that modification of AI2O3 with titania has a positive effect on the conversion rates of the catalyst<br>
NOx reduction on Pd based catalysts by H2 and CO in the presence of oxygen<br>
[0047] In various embodiments, the present invention contemplates an emissions system using CO in the HrSCR process. Figure 8 illustrates the influence of CO on the H2-SCR reaction over the 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2-Al2O3 catalyst with the total reductant concentration at about 4000 ppm. This aspect of the present invention surprisingly indicates that the presence of CO decreases the NO conversion, especially in the low temperature range. This result differs from previous theories that predicted enhancement by CO on Pd/TiO2/AI2O3. As the CO concentration is increased, the temperature of maximum NO conversion shifts from 150°C to 200°C. The presence of CO inhibits the H2 oxidation reaction as the temperature to reach complete oxidation of H2 increases from 170°C to 200°C as CO is added to the feed gas. The effect of CO on N2 selectivity is very complex in the low temperature range, while at high temperatures the N2 selectivity appears to be independent of the presence of CO.<br>
Kinetics studies for H2-SCR in the presence of CO and excess 02 in a differential reactor<br>
[0048] To determine the reaction order with respect to NO, the concentrations of H2, CO, and 02 are kept constant. The concentration of NO is subsequently varied from 100 ppm to 500 ppm. Similarly, to determine the reaction order with respect to H2, the concentration of NO and CO are kept constant, while varying the concentration of H2 between 1000 ppm and 5000 ppm. The flow rate is about 500 ml/min and only 5 mg of catalyst is used, with less than 20% NO conversion obtained at 200°C. Thus, the reactor can be treated as a differential reactor Experimental results of the rate of NO conversion as a function of NO, CO, H2, and 02 concentrations are presented In<br>
Rgure 9-12. Rgure 9 shows that the rate of NO conversion increases linearly as a function of NO concentration. The reaction rate of NO conversion as a function of reactant concentrations can be expressed in Equation 1 as follows:<br>
where TNO is the SCR rate, ka is the apparent rate constant, and x, y, z, and m are reaction order for NO, H2, CO, and O2, respectively. According to Rgure 9, the reaction order (x) with respect to NO is 0.92, thus making this reaction close to first-order.<br>
[0049] The rate of NO conversion as a function of H2 concentration is shown in Rgure 10, and is found to increase with increasing H2 concentrations. The reaction order (y) with respect to the H2 concentration is calculated to be 0.6. Rgure 11 shows the rate of NO conversion as a function of CO concentration. The rate of NO conversion decreases with CO concentration. Thus, CO inhibits the reaction, which can be attributed to the competitive adsorption between NO and H2. The reaction order (z) with respect to CO concentration is calculated to be -0.18. The rate of NO conversion as a function of Oz concentration is shown in Rgure 12 (500 ppm NO, 4000 ppm H2) 500 ppm CO). When the 02 concentration increases from about 2% to 10%, the NO consumption rate slightly decreases. The reaction order (m) with respect to 02 is calculated to be -0.04.<br>
[0050] According to the above results, the H2-SCR reaction in the presence of CO and excess 02 can be considered to be approximately first-order with respect to NO, 0.6-order to H2, -0.18-order to CO and -0.04-order to 02. The rate of NO conversion can be expressed in Equation 2 as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Effects of Water and S02 on the HrSCR reaction<br>
[0051] Water vapor is a major component in diesel engine exhaust and often leads to catalyst deactivation. Resistance of the NOx abatement catalyst to deactivation by water vapor is an important factor. Rgure 13 shows the effect of H20 on the SCR activity of the Pd-V2O5/TiO2-Al2O3 catalyst.  It should be noted<br>
that before the addition of water, the SCR reaction is allowed to stabilize for one hour at 200°C.<br>
[0052] The addition of 2.3% H20 affects only a barely detectable decrease in the NO conversion. Upon removal of the water vapor, the activity is rapidly restored to its original level. The effect of S02 on the SCR activity is another important factor in the H-rSCR reaction due to the presence, although very small, of sulfur in the diesel fuel. Figure 14 indicates the effect of S02 on SCR activity of the Pd-V2O5/TiO2-Al2O3 catalyst. Results indicate that a 20 ppm SO2 concentration at 200°C rapidly decreases the NO conversion rate within the first 2 hours of the reaction, and the reaction slowly stabilizes to yield a 46% conversion (down from 85%) in about 4 hours. Removal of the SOz feed restored the activity to about 90%.<br>
FTJR studies<br>
[0053] Figure 15 shows the FTIR spectra obtained at 150°C, 200°C, and 240°C (4000 ppm H2 + 500 ppm NO + 5% O2) over the 1%Pd/Ti02-AI2O3 catalyst At 150°C, two broad peaks are present at 1600 cm"1 and 1300 cm1. The various bands between 1600-1550 cm"1 and 1300 cm'1 observed may be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes of variously coordinated nitrates. The bands at 1904 cm'1 and 1848 cm'1 are attributed to gas phase or weakly adsorbed NO. The band at 1610 cm"1 can be assigned to adsorbed N02. The band at 1270 cm'1 is attributed to the deformation modes of adsorbed NH3. Another band at 1620 cm"1 due to the deformation modes is barely detected because of overlapping by the band for nitrate, A very weak band at 1740 cm"1 may be assigned to Pd°-NO. The intensity of all the bands associated with nitrates and nitrite decreases as the temperature is increased from 150 to 240°C while the band at 1270 cm'1 due to adsorbed NH3 intensifies and dominates at high temperatures.<br>
[0054] The corresponding FTIR spectra obtained over 1%Pd-5%V2O5/Ti02-AL2O3 are shown in Figure 16. At 150°C (spectrum of Figure 16), the bands due to Pd°-NO (1740 cm*1), gas phase or weakly adsorbed NO (1904 and 1837 cm"1), NO2 (1611 cm"1), and nitrate (1583, 1348, and 1300 cm"1) are also observed similar to the corresponding spectra in Figure 15. Two new weak<br><br>
bands at 1460 and 1680 cm"1 are observed, which are assigned to the symmetric and asymmetric bending modes of NhU*. With increasing temperature, the bands related to nitrates/nitrite decrease significantly, while the bands related to ammonium and ammonia increase first at 200°C and decrease slightly at 240°C. As the temperature is increased from 150°C to 240°C, two significant differences are observed. First, the intensity of the bands increases markedly due to NH»+. Second, a new band at 1510 cm"1 is formed due to amide (NHz). From Figures 15 and 16, it can be seen that a significant amount of MHS is formed at temperatures greater than about 200°C on 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2-<br>
Al2O3 compared to that on 1 %Pd/Ti0rA!2O3.<br>
[0055] In order to study the reactivity of NH*+ and NH3 with NO in the presence of 02, FTIR spectra {Figure 17) are obtained over the 1%Pd-5%V2O5fi"iO2-AL2O3 catalyst at 200°C following a switch from a feed gas containing 4000 ppm H2 , 500 ppm NO, and 5% O2, to one containing 500 ppm NO and 5% O2. After 1.5 min, the band at 1460 cm"1 due to NH*+ almost disappears (due to reaction with NO + 02), while the band at 1270 cm'1, due to NH3, has a slight variation. The result indicates that NH*+ is more reactive than NH3 in the SCR reaction. After about 10 min, both NH** and NH3 peaks disappear, indicating that both species can react with NO+O2 at different rates.<br>
[0056] Thus, in various embodiments, the 1%Pd-5%V2O5/TiO2-Al2O3 catalyst offers significantly high NO conversions using H2 and CO as a reducing agent in the presence of excess oxygen and at a very high space velocity. Compared to others, this catalyst exhibits a higher NO reduction activity as well as a wider operating temperature window.<br>
[0057] The description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and, thus, variations that do not depart from the gist of the invention are intended to be within the scope of the invention. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
