				<td>[Detailed Description of the Inventionl<br>
[Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle, and particularly to improvements in a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle having a tubular shaft supported by one fork leg and engaged with an outer circumference of a rear axle having both ends supported by a pair of left and right fork legs of a rear fork, a drive disk chain-driven from a drive power source rotatably mounted on the tubular shaft, and further having mounted on the rear axle, a hub of the rear wheel connected so as to be capable of being slipped onto the drive disk in an axial direction, and a side spacing tube longer than the connecting depth in an axial direction of the hub with the drive disk, the side spacing tube being interposed between the hub and the other fork leg. -fOOOTT [Related Art]<br>
Fig. 8 shows a rear wheel support and drive assembly of the related art. In this the drawing, reference numerals 2L and 2R are a pair of left and right fork legs constituting a rear fork 2 of a motor cycle, and both ends of a rear axle 11 penetrating through an axle hole 5 are inserted into and supported at rear ends of these fork legs. At a central part of this rear axle 11, a hub 14 of a rear wheel Wr surrounds a central spacing tube 16 and is supported via a pair of left and right ball bearings 19 and 20. A tubular shaft 012 is arranged on the left side of the hub 14, and a brake panel 15 and side spacing tube 18 penetrated by the rear axle 11 are arranged on the right side of the hub 14.<br>
A drive disk 13 having a sprocket 21 fixed to the left side surface by bolts 22 is attached on an outer circumference of the tubular shaft 012 via ball bearing 23. In this case, an outer race 23o of the ball bearing 23 is lightly press fitted into the drive disk member, while the inner race 23i of the ball bearing 23 is gripped between a gripping tube 17, that is surrounds the tubular pipe 012 and comes into contact with an inner surface of the left fork leg-2L, and a flange 12a formed on the<br>
tubular shaft 012. A number of transmission projections 24 and engagement indents<br>
25	are respectively formed in opposing surfaces of the drive disk 13 and the hub 14,<br>
and the drive disk 13 and the hub 14 are mutually interlocked via damper rubbers<br>
26	and are detachable in an axial direction.<br>
The tubular shaft 012 has a left end protruding as far as the outer side of the left fork leg 2L, and by screwing a lock nut 30 on the protruding end the tubular shaft 012 is fixed to and supported by the inner race 231 together with the left fork leg 2L. The rear axle 11 is constructed as a bolt having a hexagonal head part on one end and a screw shaft part 12b on the other end, and is fixed to and supported by the two fork legs 2L and 2R by bringing the head part lla into contact with an outer tip of the tubular shaft 012, and screwing a self-locking nut 34 on the threaded shaft part lib.<br>
In the drawings, reference numeral 35 is chain for driving a sprocket 21 and is driven from an engine (not shown), and reference numeral 7 is a chain adjustment bolt for adjusting the tightness of the chain 35.<br>
40006}-<br>
A rear wheel assembly 028 comprises the rear wheel Wr, the tubular shaft 012, the drive disk 13, the gripping tube 17 and the brake panel 15. A width L, of this assembly 028, namely a distance between respective outer surfaces of the tubular shaft 012 and the brake panel 15, is set smaller than a distance L2 between inner surfaces of the two fork legs 2L and 2R. Also, a length L3 of the side spacing<br>
tube 18 is set larger than a fitting depth L4 of the drive disk 13 and the hub 14.<br>
Therefore, when producing a motorcycle, the rear wheel assembly 028 is assembled in advance, and this assembly can be inserted between the two fork legs 2L and 2R. Then, while moving this assembly 028 in a leftward direction, the tubular shaft 012 is inserted into the axle hole 5 of the left fork leg 2L, causing an outer part to protrude, and a lock nut 30 is screwed onto this protruding end portion. Next, after inserting the side spacing tube 18 between the brake panel 15 and the right side fork 2R, the rear axle 11 is passed through the tubular shaft 012, the ball<br>
bearing 19, the central spacing tube 16, the ball bearing 20, the brake panel 15, the side spacing tube 18 and the right side fork 2R, a self nut 34 is screwed on the end of the rear axle 11 and assembly is completed. In this case, first of all with the lock nut 30 and the self-locking nut 34 described above in a loosely attached state the rear axle 11 is made to move to the rear using the chain adjustment bolt 7 to give an appropriate tension, and after that the two nuts are tightened up.<br>
When the rear wheel Wr is removed, in order to facilitate puncture repair or maintenance etc. first of all the rear axle 11 is slid out, then after the side spacing tube 18 has been removed if the hub 14 is shifted to the right the hub 14, namely, the rear wheel Wr can be detached with the drive disk 13 remaining as it is on the tubular shaft 012 fixed to the left fork leg 2L. In this way, removal of the rear wheel Wr is possible with the drive disk remaining as it is at a fixed position on the side of the left fork leg, which means that the removal operation, and obviously also a re-assembly operation, are simplified and moreover there is no need to readjust the chain.<br>
[Problems To Be Solved By The Invention]<br>
However, in the above described rear wheel assembly of the related art, since the tubular shaft 012 is fixed to the left forkfe§.2L it is caused to protrude outside the fork -teg- 2L and a lock nut is screwed onto the protruding end of the tubular shaft. This means that the length of the tubular shaft 012 protruding from the drive disk must be set to a large value. As a result, a width L, of the rear wheel assembly inevitably becomes wider and when the rear wheel assembly 028 is inserted between the left and right fork legs 2L and 2R in assembly processing of the motor cycle there is a danger that components will collide with each other. Also, in order to increase the support rigidity of the fork legs2L and 2R with respect to the rear axle 11, when the rear axle 11 is supported by thick parts of the fork legs 2L and 2R the tubular shaft 012 passing through the fork legs - must be made much longer, which means that if the space between the fork legs: 2L and 2R is specially widened use of the above structure becomes difficult.<br>
The present invention has been conceived in view of the above described problems, and an object of the present invention is to provide a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motor cycle having favorable ease of assembly wherein, in assembly processing of the motor cycle, a rear wheel assembly having a tubular shaft can be simply inserted between a pair of left and right fork legs of a rear fork without causing components to collide with each other, and even if a rear axle is supported by thick portions of the fork legs the rear wheel assembly can be inserted without specially enlarging a space between the left and right<br>
[Means For Solving The Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above described object, a first aspect of the present invention provides a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle having a tubular shaft supported by one fork leg and engaged with an outer circumference of a rear axle having both ends supported by a pair of left and right fork legs of a rear fork, a drive disk chain-driven from a drive power source rotatably mounted on the tubular shaft, and further having mounted on the rear axle, a hub of the rear wheel connected so as to be capable of being slipped onto the drive disk in an axial direction, and a side spacing tube longer than the connecting depth in an axial direction of the hub with the drive disk, the side spacing tube being interposed between the hub and the other fork leg, comprising support means provided on the fork leg, detachably connected to the tubular shaft in the vicinity of an inner wall of the fork^teg? for supporting an outer tubular shaft when the rear axle is pulled out. fOOTZT<br>
According to this first aspect, it is possible to allow the tubular shaft to be supported on the fork legs using the support means without causing cause one end of the tubular shaft to penetrate through the fork legs Accordingly, the length by which the tubular shaft protrudes from the drive disk of the tubular shaft can be substantially shortened, which means that the width of the rear wheel assembly comprising the tubular shaft, drive disk and rear wheel cam also be substantially reduced, and in the assembly process this rear wheel assembly can be easily inserted between the left and right fork legs. Also, even if the rear wheel is<br>
supported at thick parts of the fork legs, the rear wheel assembly can be inserted<br>
without specially widening the space between the fork tegs.<br>
[0013].<br>
Further, a second aspect of the present invention provides, in addition to the first aspect, a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle wherein one end of the tubular shaft is formed so that a tip portion protrudes into an axle hole of the fork leg and terminates inside the fork legf and the support means is provided with a contact section, for bringing the support means into contact with an inner surface of the front fork, and provided on an outer circumference of the tubular shaft, and a bolt member inserted into the axle hole from an outside surface of the fork leg and screwed into the tubular shaft to clamp the fork leg from both inner and outer surfaces through cooperative operation with the contact portion. -{00 M).<br>
Accordmg to this second aspect, it is possible to fix the tubular shaft to the fork legs using the bolt member without causing one end of the tubular shaft to penetrate through the fork legs, and accordingly, similarly to the case in the related art, attaching and detaching of the rear wheel is possible in a stale where the drive disk remains on the side of one of the fork-<br><br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle having a tubular shaft supported by one fork and engaged with an outer circumference of a rear axle having both ends supported by a pair of left and right forks of a rear fork, a drive disk chain-driven from a drive power source rotatably mounted on the tubular shaft, and having mounted on the rear axle, a hub of the rear wheel is,<br><j></j>
connected so as to be capable of being alippcd onto' ther drive disk in an axial direction, and a side spacing tube longer than the collecting depth in an axial direction of the hub with the drive disk, the side spacing tube being interposed between the hub and the other fork, characterised in that, one end of said tubular shaft is formed so that a tip portion protrudes into an axle hole of the fork and terminates inside the forks;<br>
support means provided on the fork, detachably connected to the tubular shaft in the vicinity of an inner wall of the fork, for supporting the tubular shaft when the rear axle is pulled out.<br>

-{6013] [Embodiments Of The Invention]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described below based on the attached drawins.<br><br>
First of all, a first embodiment of the present invention will be described using Fig. 1 to Fig. 4. Fig. 1 is a side elevation of a motor cycle to which a first embodiment of the present invention relates, Fig. 2 is a cross sectional drawing along line 2 - 2 in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a cross sectional drawing along line 3 - 3 in Fig. 1, and Fig. 4 is a cross sectional drawing along line 4 - 4 in Fig. 1.<br>
In Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the front end of a rear fork 2 provided with a pair of left and right fork legs.2L and 2R is connected to the rear part of a frame 1 of a motorcycle M via a horizontal pivot 3, and a cushion unit 4 for damping vertical<br>
swinging of the rear fork 2 is interposed between each of the fork legs 2L and 2R and the frame 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, each of the fork legs.2L and 2R is comprised of an angular pipe member having a rectangular cross section with long pieces pointing in a vertical direction, and axle hole 5 having an elongated shape extending longitudinally are provided on both side walls of rear parts of the respective fork legs 2L, 2R. a reinforcement plate 42 having an elongated hole aligned with the axle hole 5 is welded to the inner side surface of the left fork teg: 2L.<br>
open-ended square shaped axle support members 6 having bosses 6a in line with an axial direction of the axle holes 5 are housed inside each of the fork-tegs-&gt; 2L and 2R so as to be capable of sliding in the longitudinal direction. Adjustment bolts 7 are fixed to the rear ends of these axle support members, and the ends penetrate through a blocking plate 8 welded to the rear end of each of the fork"tegS5 2L and 2R and extend toward the rear, with adjustment nuts 9 and lock nuts 10 being screwed on to the adjustment bolts 7.<br>
The rear axle 11 is arranged so as to penetrate through the axle holes 5 and bosses 6a of the two fork -tegs. 2L and 2R. A tubular shaft 12, drive disk 13, rear wheel Wr hub 14 brake panel 15 gripping tube 17 and side spacing tube 18 having the same structure as in the related art shown in Fig 8 are attached to this axle shaft 11.<br>
That is, at the central portion of the rear axle 11 the hub 14 of the rear wheel Wr is supported by a pair of left and right ball bearings 19 and 20 lined up so as to sandwich the central spacing tube 16. The tubular shaft 12 penetrated by the rear axle 11 is arranged on the left side of this hub while the break panel 15 and side spacing tube 18 penetrated by the rear axle 11 are arranged on the right side of the hub 14. The drive disk 13 having a sprocket 21 fixed on its left side surface with bolts 22 is fastened to the outside of the tubular shaft 12 through ball bearing<br>
23. In that case, the outer race 23o of the above described ball bearing 23 is press fitted to the drive disk 13 while the inner race 23i of the ball bearing 23 has the tubular shaft 12 passing through it and is gripped between the gripping tube 17 contacting with an inner surface of the left side fork leg 2L and a flange 12a formed on the tubular shaft 12.<br>
[6022T<br>
A number of transmission projections 24 and indents 25 are respectively formed in opposing surfaces of the drive disk 13 and the hub 14, and the drive disk 13 and the hub 14 are mutually interlocked via damper rubbers 26 and are detachable in an axial direction (refer to Fig. 4). Accordingly, transmission torque between the drive disk 13 and the hub 14 can be absorbed using the damping action of the damper rubbers 26.<br>
A dust seal 27 adjacent to the outer side of the ball bearing 23 and connected to the outer peripheral surface of the gripping tube 17 and is mounted on the drive disk 13.<br>
[002"4T<br>
The tubular shaft 12 is different from the related art in that the length by which it protrudes from the outer end surface of the gripping tube 17 us shortened, and the end part of the tubular shaft 12 is only fitted as far as the mid-portion of the boss 6a of the axle support member 6. [0025]<br>
Accordingly, the width L1 of the rear wheel assembly 28 comprising the tubular shaft 12, drive disk 13, rear wheel Wr and brake panel 15 becomes sufficiently smaller than a distance L, between inner surfaces of the left and right fork legs 2L and 2R. Obviously, the length L3 of the side spacing pipe 18 is set larger than a fitting depth L4 of the drive disk 13 and the hub 14.<br>
A threaded hole 12b is formed in the end of the tubular shaft 12, a threaded shaft 29 that has been inserted into the shaft hole 5 and the boss 6a from the outer side of the left fork leg is screwed into this threaded hole 12b, and a lock nut 30 is screwed onto the end of the threaded shaft 29. When the threaded shaft 29 is being<br>
screwed into the threaded hole 12b, it is necessary to prevent rotation of the tubular shaft 12, and a pair of chamfered sections for coming into contact with upper and lower flat inner side  surfaces of the  axle hole  5  are formed  on the  outer circumference of the tubular shaft 12. {0027]<br>
The threaded shaft 29 and the lock nut 30 constitute the bolt member 32, and the tubular shaft 12 is fastened to the fork leg 2L by this bolt member 32 gripping the left side fork leg 2L together with the gripping tube 17. Also, the support means 33 of the present invention is comprised of the gripping tube 17 (contact section) and the bolt member 32.<br>
The threaded shaft 29 is mounted around the rear axle 11. A hexagonal head 1 la of the rear axle 11 is made to contact the outer end of the threaded shaft 29 and the self locking nut 34 is screwed on to the threaded shaft part l1b on the end of the rear axle 11.<br>
40029}<br>
In the drawings, reference numeral 35 is a chain cover for covering a chain 35, and this chain cover is bolted to a cover bracket 37 formed in a reinforcement plate of the inner surface of the left fork-leg. 2L. [0030]<br>
Description of the operation of this embodiment will now be given.<br>
When producing a motorcycle, similarly to the related art, the rear wheel assembly 28 is assembled in advance, and this assembly can be inserted between the two fork legs 2L and 2R. At this time, as previously described, the tubular shaft 12 is not caused to penetrate through the left fork leg-21,, which means that the length to which the tubular shaft 12 protrudes from the gripping tube 17 is shortened, and accordingly the width L, of the rear wheel assembly 28 becomes sufficiently shorter than a distance L2 between inner surfaces of the left and right fork legs2L and 2R. This means that the collision of the left and right fork legs. 2L and 2R with the rear wheel assembly 28 can be simply avoided. What this means in actual fact is that even if a part of the left and right fork legs 2L and 2R for<br>
supporting the rear axle is as thick as the example shown in the drawings, the rear wheel assembly 28 can be inserted in between the two fork tegs-2L and 2R without specially expanding the distance L2 between inner surfaces of the fork legs. [00521<br>
After insertion between the two fork legs, the rear wheel assembly 28 is moved to the left, the tubular shaft 12 is inserted into the axle hole 5 of the left fork leg and the boss 6a of the axle support member 6, the threaded tube 29 that has been inserted into the axle hole 5 and the boss 6a from the outer side of the left fork leg 2L is screwed into the threaded hole of the tubular shaft 12, and a lock nut 30 is screwed onto an outer end of this threaded tube 29. Then, once the side spacing tube 18 has been inserted between the brake panel 15 and the right fork leg 2R, the rear axle is passed through the threaded shaft 29, the tubular shaft 12, the ball bearing 19, the central spacing tube 16, the ball bearing 20, the brake panel 15, the side spacing tube 18 and the left fork leg: 2R, and a self-locking nut 34 is screwed on the threaded tip end l1b of the axle 11. In this case, if an adjusting nut 9 is fastened to the chain adjustment bolt 7 with the lock nut 30 and the self-locking nut 34 loosely attached, the axle support member 6 is caused to move to the rear together with the rear axle 11 via the adjustment bolt 7, and it is possible to impart a suitable tension on the chain 35. After this chain adjustment, the lock nut 30 and the self locking nut 34 are tightened up.<br>
After that, in order to facilitate puncture repair or maintenance etc., in the event that the rear wheel Wr is removed, first of all the rear axle 11 is slid out, then after the side spacing tube 18 has been removed if the hub 14 is shifted to the right, the hub 14, that is, the rear wheel Wr, can be detached with the drive disk 13 remaining as it is on the tubular shaft 12 fixed to the left fork leg 2L via the bolt member 32. Accordingly, similarly to the related art, removal of the rear wheel Wr, and obviously also a re-assembly operation, are simplified and after re-assembly there is no need to readjust the chain.<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described using Fis. 5 to Fig  7. Fig. 5 is a cross sectional drawing similar to Fig. 2 showing a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention, Fig. 6 is a cross sectional drawing along line 6 - 6 in Fig. 5, and Fig. 7 is a cross sectional drawing along line 7 - 7 in Fig. 5.<br>
This embodiment differs from the previous embodiment in that the support means 117 of the tubular shaft 12, and description will be given of this support means.<br>
A gripping tube 117 has an externally square shape, and has a circumferential groove 117a provided on an outer periphery. This gripping tube 117 is screwed on to the outer periphery of the tubular shaft 112. At this time, the end of the tubular shaft 12 is caused to terminate inside the gripping tube 117 and becomes shorter than the tubular shaft 12 in the previous embodiment. [0037]<br>
On the other hand, a support frame 41 for supporting the gripping tube 1 17 is welded to a reinforcement plate 42 that has been welded to an inner surface of the left fork leg 2L. This support frame 41 has a U-shape with straight line portions extending parallel to the elongated axle holes 5, and an open end facing towards the rear, and is provided with a flange 4 la defining a gap along the reinforcement plate 42. This flange 41a is provided so as to engage with the circumferential groove 117a of the gripping tube 117, and the support means 133 comprises this circumferential groove and the support frame 41. The rest of the construction is the same as in the previous embodiment and so parts corresponding to parts in the previous embodiment have the same reference numerals attached thereto and description is omitted. {0038]<br>
When the rear wheel assembly 128 is composed of the tubular shaft 112, the gripping tube 117, the drive disk 12, the rear wheel Wr and the brake panel 15, the tubular shaft 112 does not protrude at all from the outer end surface of the gripping tube 117, which means that the width L1 of the rear wheel assembly 128 becomes smaller than that in the previous embodiment. Accordingly, in assembly processing the rear wheel assembly 128 can be inserted extremely easily between<br>
the left and right fork legs 2L and 2R, and also by engaging the circumferential groove 117a of the gripping tube 117 with the inward turning flange 41a of the support frame 41 the tubular shaft 112 can be supported via the gripping tube 117. Subsequent assembly processing is essentially the same as in the previous embodiment. [0059]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above described embodiments, and various modifications are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. For example, In the first embodiment, it is possible to integrally form the threaded shaft 29 and the lock nut 30. {6046}-[Effects Of The Invention]<br>
According to the first aspect of the present invention as described above, there is provided a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle having a tubular shaft supported by one fork
widening the space between the fork legs. [6041]<br>
According to the second aspect of the present invention as described above, there is provided a rear wheel support and drive assembly for a motorcycle wherein one end of the tubular shaft is formed so that a tip portion protrudes into an axle hole of the fork leg and terminates inside the fork leg,,and the support means is provided with a contact section, for bringing the support means into contact with an inner surface of the front fork, and provided on an outer circumference of the tubular shaft, and a bolt member inserted into the axle hole from an outside surface of the fork leg and screwed into the tubular shaft to clamp the fork leg from both inner and outer surfaces through cooperative operation with the contact portion. This means that it is possible fix the tubular shaft to the fork legs using the bolt<br>
member without causing one end of the tubular shaft to penetrate through the fork legs, and accordingly, similarly to the case in the related art, attaching and detaching of the rear wheel is possible in a state where the drive disk remains on the side of one of the fork legs. Therefore, there is no need for readjustment of the chain and favorable maintainability is ensured.<br>
