This invention relates to a process for the preparation of<br>
1»A,7,10-t€traa2acyclodod€\cane-1-acetic acid of the formula V <br>
The Compound of formula (I) was  surprisingly<br><br>
synthesized starting from compound of formula (II) ; 2a,4a,6a,8a-decahydro-teatraazacyclopentCfg]acena-phthylene, already known as an intermediate for the preparation of polyazamacrocycles derivatives.<br><br>
The compound of formula (II) can, in its turn, be obtained starting from straight polyamines, as described in Italian Patent application MI 96A 001257, and it can be converted to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane {commonly named Cyclen) according to the following scheme:<br><br><br>
in which step a) is the condensation of triethylenetriamine with a glyoxal derivative (glyoxal hydrate, or Bertagnini's salt), in water or in water-soluble solvents or in mixtures thereof, at temperatures from 0 to 50°C, in the presence of stoichiometric amounts or in a slight excess of calcium hydroxides-step b) is the condensation of the resulting compound from step a) with an X-CH2-CH2-X alkylating agent, in which X is a halogen or a sulfonic acid reactive derivative, in at least stoichiometric amounts, in the presence of at least two moles of a base selected from alkali or alkaline-earth metal carbonates per mole of substrate, at a temperature of 25-150°C, to give the compound of formula (II);<br>
step c) is the oxidation of the compound of formula (II) with a suitable oxidizing agent for aliphatic amines, in water or in a diphasic system consisting of water and an organic solvent, resistant to such conditions, at temperatures from 0 to 100°C, to give a mixture of oxidized products which is subjected directly to<br><br>
step d); consisting of the hydrolysis, either in aqueous acidic medium at pH lower than 2, or in an aqueous basic medium at pH higher than 12, at temperatures of 110-200'C, to give the compound of  formula  (III) .<br>
Compound (III) is the starting material for the synthesis of polydentated derivatives capable of complexing different metals, some of which find use in the biomedical field, such as gadolinium complexes of said derivatives, which are used in the medical diagnostic field as contrast agents for the resonance technique (Magnetic Resonance Imaging, MRI).<br>
At present, two contrast media are commercially available, namely Dotarem(R) (gadolinium complex of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid meglumine salt), and ProHance (R) [Gadoteridol, gadolinium complex of 10-(2-hydroxypropyl)-!,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7-triacetic acid]; on the other hand, Gadobutrol is a contrast medium at present under development (gadolinium complex of [10-[2,3-dihydroxy-l-(hydroxymethyl)propyl]-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l ,4,7-triacetic acid])<br><br><br>
The possible procedures for the conversion of compound (11) to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (III) were described in WO 96/28432 and in MI 96A 001257, and they are based on suitably optimized hydrolytic or oxidizing conditions for the preparation of compound<br>
(III).<br>
These novel synthetic routes for the preparation of compound (III) are an important improvement of the conventional synthesis by Richman-Atkins (J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 1974, 96, 2268) based on the use of tosyl derivatives, in that they provide simpler, more economic and environmentally safer industrial processes.<br><br>
However, except for Gd-DOTA, obtainable from 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (III ) by alkylation of the four nitrogen atoms and subsequent complexation of the intermediate 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-' 1,4 , 7,10-tetraacetic acid, macrocycle (III) cannot, as a rule, be used directly for the preparation of gadolinium complexes wherein the macrocycle nitrogen atoms are variously substituted.<br>
In these cases it is, in fact, necessary to make use of the selective protection of the nitrogen atoms to direct the subsequent functionalization of the macrocycle towards the desired positions.<br>
For example, the key intermediate of the synthesis of Gadoteridol and Gadobutrol is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (D03A), preparabile starting from (III) (see for ex.: Tweedle et al., Inorg. Chem., 1265, 1991) through the tricyclic intermediate of formula (IV) according to the scheme reported in the following.<br><br>
When such . disubstituted derivatives of compound (III) are desired, as, for example, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,7-diacetic acid (1,7-D02A), the synthetic route starting from macrocycle (III ) is extremely complex, as described, for example, by Sherry in a paper (J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1995, 185) and<br><br>
it is based on a series of selective protections, which make use of reactives rather unsuitable for possible industrial applications, mainly due to economic and environmental reasons;<br><br>
or as described by the same author in WO 93/12097, which, however, involves the use of cyanides.<br><br>
What stated above clearly shows that any direct synthetic routes for the preparation of D03A or 1,7-D02A or, in general, of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (III)<br><br>
trisubstituted or disubstituted derivatives would, on one hand, be a remarkable improvement in the processes for the synthesis of Gadoteridol and Gadobutrol and, on the other hand, open a way to the preparation of possible novel complexes for MRI, which are, at present, available with difficulty due to the above cited synthetic problems.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found, and this is the object of the present invention, that the novel compound (I), synthesized starting from compound (II), according to the following Scheme 1:<br><br>
(II)	(I)<br>
wherein compound (II) is reacted with piperazine at controlled pH to give compound (I), is a useful intermediate for the preparation of 1,4,7,lO-tetraazacyclodode-cane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid derivatives.<br>
Contrary to what described in literature by Weisman (Tetrahedron Letters, 1980, 21, 33 5) and by Kolinski (Tetrahedron Letters, 1981, 22, 2217) , compound (II) is highly reactive also in hydrolytic conditions.<br>
The conversion of (II) to (I) involves heating (II) in aqueous solution at temperatures from 80 to 100°C, at pH slightly acidic, neutral or slightly basic (pH 5-9), and in the presence of piperazine, added in amounts<br><br>
ranging from 2 to 20 mol/mol of (II).<br>
At the end of the reaction, the mixture is alkalinized, concentrated to dryness and extracted with toluene. The toluene solution is partially concentrated and cooled to separate piperazine, which is filtered and can be purified and recycled.<br>
Toluene mother liquors are further concentrated, to obtain (I), which can be recrystallized, for example, from toluene.<br>
Alternatively, at the end of the reaction, the inorganic anions can be removed by ion-exchange. Eluates are suitably concentrated and added with orthophosphoric acid to pH 6.5, thereby precipitating piperazine H3PO4 salt. After filtration, the residual phosphate ions are removed from mother liquors by a second ion-exchange, eluates are concentrated to a residue which is recrystallized from toluene, to obtain (I) at high purity.<br>
Compound (I) showed an extremely interesting reactivity, in particular it can be used for the preparation of 1/4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (III) variously substituted derivatives, avoiding the step of formation of (III) itself, which is, on the contrary, mandatory when following the procedure at present available in literature.<br>
Compound (I) is a lactam with a 6 atoms cycle and should therefore be remarkably stable in hydrolysis conditions.<br>
Surprisingly, compound (I) is converted by basic hydrolysis, in not quite drastic conditions, to 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l-acetic acid of formula<br><br>
(V),  i.e.  to  a  N-monofunctionalized  derivative  of compound (III), according to the following Scheme 2:<br><br>
Compound (I) can be hydrolysed in aqueous basic solution by heating to temperatures from 60 to 100°C, at pH higher than 12.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention the process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (VII) starting from compound (V), obtained according to the process represented in Scheme 2, by alkylation, according to known methods, with an excess of an R-CH(X)-COY alkylating agent of formula (VI), optionally followed by hydrolysis of the ester groups present, represented in the following Scheme 3:<br><br><br>
in which<br>
R is a hydrogen atom, a straight, branched or cyclic C1-C6 alkyl group, unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 10 oxygen atoms, or a C1-C20 alkyl group, optionally interrupted by a phenylene, phenyloxy or phenylenedioxy, in its turn substituted with a straight or branched C1-C6 alkyl group, unsubstituted or substituted with 1 to 7 hydroxy groups or with 1 to 3 C1-C7 groups;<br>
the aromatic group can be unsubstituted or substituted with alkoxy groups or halogens, carboxy, carbamoyl, alkoxycarbonyl, sulfamoyl, hydroxyalkyl, amino, acylamino, acyl, hydroxyacyl groups; X   is a halogen or a sulfonic acid reactive residue,<br>
and Y is a -OH or -OR1 group, wherein R1 is a straight or branched C1-C4 alkyl group, when Y is the same as -OR1 the ester groups are also hydrolysed, according to known methods, to obtain the compounds of formula (VII).<br>
The alkylating agents (VI) corresponding to compound R-CH(X)-COOH of formula (VIII), and in which X is bromine or chlorine, are preferred, particularly preferred being the alkylating agents of formula (VIII), in which R is a hydrogen atom, corresponding to compound of formula (Villa), XCH2COOH, in which X is bromine or chlorine.<br>
In the other cases, the alkylating agent (VI) can be selected from the compounds which either are already commercially available or can be prepared as already<br><br>
described in literature (see for example WO 93/24469 or EP 325762), or by using, for example, known methods for the preparation of suitable precursors (e.g., for acid chlorides a-halogen derivatives see: Harpp et al., J. Org. Chem., 40, 3420, 1975), and subsequent transformation into the desired product.<br>
Preferably, the R group can be selected from the group consisting of: H or a straight or branched alkyl group, such as a methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl group, in its turn substituted with hydroxy groups or interrupted by oxygen atoms, as defined above.<br>
When an aromatic group is present in R, particularly preferred are; phenyl, benzyl, phenylmethoxymethyl groups.<br>
Particularly preferred are 3-(phenylmethoxy)propanoic acid reactive derivatives, such as 2-bromo-3-(phenylmethoxy)propanoic acid, the preparation of which is described in Grossman et al., Chem. Ber., 91, 538, 1958, and 2-chloro-3-(phenylmethoxy)propanoic acid (CAS RN 124628-32-6), prepared analogously to the brominated derivative.<br>
On the other hand, the R-|_ group is preferably selected from methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl.<br>
The reactive group X can be selected, by way of<br>
example, from the group consisting of halogens (CI, Br,<br>
I), or it is the mesylate group (MeSO2O-) , the<br>
benzenesulfonyloxy      group      (PhSO2O-) ,	the<br>
nitrobenzenesulfonyloxy   group   (p-N02PhSO2O-),   the tosylate group (TsO-), the triflate group (CF3SO2-).<br><br>
Particularly preferred are the compounds in which X is a halogen, more particularly a bromide or a chloride.<br>
The alkylation of compound (V), when Y is a hydroxyl, can be conveniently performed with reactive derivatives of secondary carboxylic acid, such as 2-bromopropionic acid, in aqueous alkali solution, at temperatures from 25 to 55°C.<br>
Particularly preferred are the alkylating agents of formula (VI), in which Y is a hydroxyl, corresponding to bromoacetic acid (commercially available product), 2-bromopropionic acid (commercially available product), 2-bromobutyric acid (commercially available product).<br>
When the alkylation reaction is carried out with an ester derivative of compound (VIII), the reaction solvent can suitably be selected from dipolar aprotic solvents, in particular from dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethylacetamide (DMA), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile (CH3CN) and N-methylpyrrolidone, and the reaction is carried out in the presence of an organic base, preferably an aliphatic tertiary amine selected from triethylamine (TEA), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and tributylamine.<br>
In this case, it can be convenient to transform also the acid group present in compound (V) into the ester group -0R&gt;|^, to promote the alkylation reaction, depending on the reactivity of the alkylating agent itself.<br>
The reaction temperature can range, in this case, from 0 to 80°C, in any case depending on the reactivity of the selected alkylating agent.<br>
In this case,  the  alkylation reaction will be<br><br>
followed by a basic hydrolysis of the resulting triester, in conventional conditions, to obtain the desired compound of formula (VII).<br>
The process of the present invention for the preparation of derivatives (VII), bearing three substituents corresponding to formula -CH(R)COOH and one -CH2COOH substituent, is a brilliant, economically advantageous solution to the problem of differentiating the four nitrogen equivalent sites.<br>
Compounds of this type, useful for the preparation of contrast agents for diagnosis by nuclear magnetic resonance, have already been described, for example, in EP 325,762.<br>
The preparation of these compounds according to the process of the present invention is economically more convenient and industrially more efficient, as it involves no use of compound (III) as starting substrate, which has a prohibitive cost (ranging from 67,000 to 98,000 Italian Lire per gram, depending on the manufacturer).<br>
By way of example of the huge potentialities given by this synthetic route, the synthesis of the novel compound, a,a' ,a*'-tris(methyl)-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-dodecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, is reported in Experimental section:<br><br><br>
as well as that of α,α',α"-trisC(phenylmethoxy)methYl)-l,4,7,10-tetraa2acyclododecane-l,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid<br><br>
which,  by  catalytic  hydrogenation,  as described  in example  6  of  the  cited  Patent,  yields  α,α',α"-tris(hydroxymethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid.<br><br>
Particularly preferred is the process according to scheme 4 for the preparation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid by alkylation with the alkylat ng agent (Villa), so as to directly synthesize DOTA starting from compound (I), according to the following scheme:<br><br><br>
in which X, Y have the meanings defined above.<br>
Compound (V) can, in fact, be easily alkylated with chloro- or bromoacetic acid, in aqueous alkaline solution, at temperatures from 25 to 55oC.<br>
It is a further object of the invention an alternative process for the preparation of the compounds (VII), as represented in Scheme 5, starting from compound (I)<br>
Scheme 5<br><br><br>
through a selective monoalkylation reaction, according to known methods, at controlled pH, with the alkylating agent (VI) as defined above, to give compound (X), which can subsequently be alkylated with the alkylating agent (VI) to give compounds (VII).<br>
It is a further object of the present invention the process for the preparation of the compounds of formula (XII), as represented in Scheme 6, starting from compound (X), obtained according to the process represented in Scheme 5<br><br>
in which compound (X) is alkylated, according to known methods, with the alkylating agent (XI) in which R', independently of R, has the same meanings as R.<br>
An example of the possibilities given by this novel process is the preparation of al,a7-bis[(phenylmethoxy)methyl)-a4-methy1-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid which, after catalytic hydrogenation, gives the debenzylated analogue.<br><br><br>
Particularly preferred is the preparation of 1,7-D02A, according to scheme 5, through formation of the novel compound 12-oxo-l,4,7,10-tetraazabicyclo[8.2.2]te-tradecane-4-acetic acid of formula {XIII), which is subjected to basic hydrolysis to give 1,7-D02A, i.e. 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,7-diacetic acid, as represented in Scheme 7<br><br><br>
Compound (I) can be selectively carboxymethylated in aqueous solution, for example with bromoacetic acid (1 mol) at pH 12.5 and at temperatures from 15 to 25°C, or in dimethylacetamide in the presence of sodium carbonate (1 mol) or of diisopropylethylamine, or in ethanol and sodium hydroxide: the resulting intermediate (XIII) can be transformed into 1,7-D02A by basic hydrolysis at pH higher than 13 and at temperatures from 80 to 100°C.<br>
1,7-D02A can, in its turn, be transformed into DOTA by reaction with the alkylating agent of formula (Villa).<br><br>
The conditions used, for example, for the alkylating agent (Villa) comprise carrying out the reaction in aqueous solution, at pH 10-12 and at temperatures from 25 to 50°C.<br>
According to the process represented in Scheme 6, when the alkylating agent (VI) corresponds to the alkylating agent (VIII), compounds of formula (XIV) can be prepared, as represented in Scheme 8:<br><br><br>
in which R, X and Y have the meanings defined above.<br>
When R in the alkylating agent (VI) is the phenylmethoxymethyl group, it is possible to prepare, by using the alkylating agents preferred for this type of substituent defined above, al,a7-bis[(phenylmethoxy)-methyl]-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7,10-tetra-acetic acid, already described in EP 325,762, and its debenzylated analogue upon catalytic hydrogenation.<br><br><br>
Again starting from compound (I), it is also possible to perform the complete differentiation of the four nitrogen atoms of tetraazacyclododecane, to give compounds (XVIII), according to the following Scheme 9:<br><br>
in which X, Y have the meanings defined above and R, R', R' have independently the same meanings.<br>
An  example  of  said  synthetic  approach  is  the preparation of al-[(phenylmethoxy)methyl]-α4-methyl-α7-ethyl-l ,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraace-tic  acid  and  of  its  debenzylated  analogue,  after catalytic hydrogenation.<br><br>
  ,o<br>
Particularly preferred is the process according to scheme 9, in which R and R' have the same meanings, represented in the following Scheme 10<br><br><br>
Also preferred is the process according to scheme 10, when R, R' and R' are at the same time a hydrogen atom, for the preparation of D03A, obtained by alkylation of compound (I) with the alkylating agent (Villa), XCH2COOH, in which X has the meanings defined above, to give the novel compound, ll-oxo-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-4,7-diacetic acid of formula (X ) , which is transformed into D03A, 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7-triacetic acid, by basic hydrolysis, according to scheme 11<br><br>
The resulting D03A can be used as starting product for the synthesis of Gadoteridol or of Gadobutrol, as already described in the above cited references.<br>
The compound {I) can be directly transformed into intermediate (X) by reaction with 2 moles of the alkylating agent (Villa), in aqueous solution, at pH 13 and at a temperature from 25 to 45°C.<br>
Compound (X) can be converted to D03A by basic hydrolysis at pH higher than 13 and at temperatures from 80 to 100°C.<br><br>
A further aspect of the process according to scheme 9, in which the alkylating agent (XVII) corresponds to that of formula (VIII), relates to the possibility to selectively obtain 1,4,7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4-diacetic acid derivatives, of formula (XXII), as represented in the following Scheme 12.<br>
Scheme 12<br>
A<br><br>
An example of this synthetic scheme is the preparation of α4-methyl-α7-methyl-l,4,7,10-tetraaza-cyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid.<br><br><br>
Also preferred is the process, according to scheme 9, for the preparation of the compounds of formula (XXIII), in which R and R' have the same meaning and the alkylating agent {XVII) corresponds to that of formula (Villa), represented in the following Scheme 13.<br><br>
For example, according to the process of Scheme 13, an alternative synthesis of αl,α4-bis[(phenyl-methoxy)methyl]-l,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-l,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid, already described in EP 325762, is possible, as well as that of its debenzylated analogue, which can be prepared by catalytic hydrogenation.<br><br><br>
In substance, compound (I) is a synton useful to obtain 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (TAZA) derivatives both mono-, and di-, tri- or tetrasubstituted (symmetrically or asymmetrically), without the troublesome use of the macrocycle itself as starting product.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-l acetic acid of formula V<br><br>
comprising hydrolysing 1,4,7,10-tetraazabicyclo (8.2.2) tetradecane-2-one of formula I<br><br>
in a aqueous basic solution at a temperature from 60°to 100°C and at a pH higher than 12 in a known manner and recovering said compound of formula V from the reaction mixture in a known manner.<br><br><br>
500  g   (2.54   mol)   of   2α , 4α,6α8αa-decahydro-tetraazacyclopent [f gjacenaphthylene ,     prepared     as described in MI96A001257, are dissolved in 4 L of water. 3.9 kg (20.0 mol) of piperazine hexahydrate are added and pH is adjusted to 6 with cone. HCl (about 2.86 kg). The solution is re fluxed for 24 h, then cooled to room temperature,  percolated on  22L  of anionic  exchanger resin Relite 3AS/FB (Resindion) and the column is washed with deionized  water.
