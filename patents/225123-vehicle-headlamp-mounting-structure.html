"VEHICLE HEADLAMP MOUNTING STRUCTURE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the   nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
The present invention relates to headlamp mounting structure.<br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention] [0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle headlamp mounting structure in which the headlamp comprising a lamp case supporting a bulb and including a reflecting surface and a lens covering thereon is mounted in such a manner that it can be swung about an aiming shaft with the lens exposed from the front opening of the vehicle body cover.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
For example, a vehicle headlamp mounting structure disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. 53472/1994, entitled "OPTICAL AXIS ADJUSTING APPARATUS FOR MOTORCYCLES AND THE LIKE" is known.<br>
The technology described above is, according to Fig. 6 in the same publication, an optical axis adjusting apparatus for motorcycle or the like constructed in such a manner that an opening 14a is formed on the front cover 14, a headlight 17 of trapezoidal shape in side view is faced toward the opening , 14a, and optical axis' adjusting screws 26,  29 are provided for adjusting the optical axis of the headlight 17. [0003]<br><br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
However, in the optical axis adjusting apparatus for motorcycle of the like in the technology described above, when the optical axis of the headlight 17 is adjusted by the optical axis adjusting screws 26, 29, a clearance between the headlight 17 (hereinafter referred to as headlamp) and the opening I4a varies, and thus the clearance may be too large depending on the adjustment, when the clearance is large, it does not look nice in terms of exterior design, and water or dust may enter into the front cover 14, whereby the interior may get soiled easily.<br>
[0004]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a vehicle headlamp mounting structure in which air resistance around the headlamp may be reduced, the design of the vehicle may be improved, and entering of water or dust through the clearance between the headlamp and the vehicle body cover covering the headlamp may be prevented.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to achieve the object above, the invention according to Claim 1 is a vehicle headlamp mounting structure for mounting the headlamp comprising a lamp case supporting a bulb and including a reflecting surface and a lens covering thereon so as to be capable of swinging about an aiming shaft<br><br>
with the lens exposed from the front opening of the vehicle body cover, wherein the lens is formed into a generally spherical surface as a whole, and is formed with spherical portions in the vicinity of the upper edge and the lower edge of the front opening so that it follows the circular arc having a center at the aiming shaft.<br>
[0006]<br>
It is preferable to be capable of reducing air resistance around the headlamp while improving the design of the vehicle. Therefore, reduction of air resistance around the headlamp is contemplated by forming the lens into a generally spherical surface as a whole. The lens is formed with spherical portions in the vicinity of the upper edge and the lower edge of the front opening so as to follow the circular arc having a center at the aiming shaft to minimize the clearance between the lens and the front opening, for example. As a consequent, the design of the vehicle improves and entering of water or dust into the clearance between the headlamp and the vehicle body cover covering the headlamp is prevented.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that light-shielding treatment for blocking light from the bulb is applied by extending the surface of generally spherical shape by providing an extension extending at least from the upper end of the lens and making the extension follow the cover<br><br>
extended from the lamp case.<br>
[0008]<br>
For example, if the light-shielding treatment can be applied to the lens without using a special member, the cost of the headlamp may be reduced.<br>
Therefore, light-shielding treatment is applied to the lens and the cost of the headlamp is reduced by extending the surface of the lens in generally spherical shape by providing the extension extended at least from the upper end of the lens, and making the extension follow the cover extended from the lamp case. The lens may be formed in the shape of a large dome by forming the extension integrally with the upper end of the lens to extend the surface of generally spherical shape, and thus, the designability of the front portion of the vehicle may be enhanced.<br>
[0009]<br>
The invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the cover is extended to both side surfaces of the lamp case, supporting bosses are provided on both of these side surfaces, and these supporting bosses are also used as an aiming shaft.<br>
The cover is extended to both side surfaces of the lamp case, and the supporting bosses are provided on these both side surfaces respectively, so that the rigidity of the lamp case is enhanced. The supporting bosses are provided on the lamp<br><br>
case with increased rigidity, and the supporting bosses are also used as an aiming shaft, so that the accuracy of the aiming adjustment (adjustment of optical axis) of the headlamp is improved.<br>
[0010]<br>
The invention according to Claim 4 is characterized in that the supporting bosses are positioned above the optical axis of the bulb.<br>
The supporting bosses are placed above the optical axis and the headlamp is suspended by the supporting bosses, so that the weight balance of the, headlamp can be maintained and thus the supporting stability of the headlamp is realized.<br>
[0011]<br>

It is referable that a headlamp mounting structure 60 is a vehicle headlamp mounting structure in which the headlamp 61 comprising a lamp case 63 supporting a bulb 62 and including a reflecting surface 67 and a lens 64 covering thereon is mounted so as to be capable of swinging about the supporting boss 71 (aiming shaft) with the lens exposed from the front opening 83 of the front cover 81 (vehicle body cover), and the lens 64 is formed into a generally spherical surface as a whole, and is formed with spherical portions 75, 76 in the vicinity of the upper edge 83a and the lower edge 83b of the front opening 83 so that it follows the circular arc having a center at the supporting boss 71 (aiming shaft).<br>
[0026]<br>
It is preferable that air resistance around the headlamp 61 can be reduced and the design of the motorcycle 10 (See Fig. 1) can be improved.<br>
Therefore, air resistance around the headlamp 61 is reduced by forming the lens into generally spherical surface<br><br>
as a whole. The lens 64 is formed with spherical portions 75, 76 near the upper edge 83a and the lower edge 83b of the front opening 83 so as to follow the circular arc having a center at the supporting boss 71 (aiming shaft) so that, for example, the clearance between the lens 64 and the front opening 83 is minimized. As a consequent, the design of the motorcycle 10 (See Fig. 1) may be improved and entering of water or dust into the clearance between the headlamp 61 and the front cover 81 (vehicle body cover) covering the headlamp 61 may be prevented.<br>
[0027]<br>
The headlamp 61 is shown to be such that the supporting bosses 71, 71 (71 located behind is not shown in the figure) are positioned above the optical axis C of the bulb 62.<br>
The supporting bosses 71,71 are placed above the optical axis C of the bulb 62 and the headlamp 61 is suspended by the supporting bosses 71, 71, so that the weight balance of the headlamp 61 can be maintained and thus the supporting stability of the headlamp 61 is realized.<br>
The optical axis adjusting mechanism 65 is constructed in such a manner that the headlamp 61 is supported with its load dispersed to three points of the supporting bosses 71, 71 located above the optical axis C and the optical axis adjusting screw 78 located below the optical axis C, and thus promoting supporting stability of the headlamp 61.<br>
[0028]<br><br>
Fig. 9 is a cross sectional view taken along the line 9-9 of Fig. 4, and showing that the headlamp 61 comprises a cover 69 extending to both side surfaces of the lamp case 63, and supporting bosses 71, 71 provided on these both side surfaces respectively so that these supporting bosses 71, 71 serve as an aiming shaft.<br>
The cover 69 is extended to both side surfaces of the lamp case 63, and the supporting bosses 71, 71 are provided on these both side surfaces respectively, so that the rigidity of the lamp case 63 is enhanced. The supporting bosses 71, 71 are provided on the lamp case 63 with increased rigidity, and the supporting bosses 71, 71 are also used as an aiming shaft, so that the accuracy of the aiming adjustment (adjustment of optical axis) of the headlamp 61 is improved.<br>
The reference numeral 77 is a sealing member for sealing the lamp case 63 and the lens 64.<br>
[0029]<br>
The operation of the headlamp mounting structure 60 for vehicles described thus far will now be described.<br>
Figs. 10(a)-(c) are the first explanatory drawings of the vehicle headlamp mounting structure according to the present invention.<br>
Fig. 10(a) shows a headlamp 61 with the optical axis oriented in the horizontal  direction.<br>
In Fig. 10(b), the optical axis of the headlamp 61 is<br><br>
inclined by the optical axis adjusting mechanism 65 as shown by the arrow (1) for an aiming adjustment (adjustment of the optical axis).<br>
In Fig. 10(c), the optical axis of the headlamp 61 is further inclined as shown by the arrow (2).<br>
[0030]<br>
In (a)-(c), since the portion of the lens 64 near the upper edge 83a and the lower edge 83b of the front opening 83 is formed with a spherical portions 75, 7 6 so that it follows the circular arc having a center at the supporting boss 71 (aiming shaft), for example, the clearance between the lens 64 and the front opening 83 does not vary according to aiming adjustment, in other words, the clearance stays constant. As a consequent, the clearance between the lens 64 and the front opening 83 can be minimized and thus the design of the motorcycle 10 (See Fig. 1) can be improved.<br>
Though the optical axis C is adjusted downward from the horizontal position as shown by the arrows (1) and (2), it is also possible to adjust the optical axis C upward from the horizontal position.<br>
[0031]<br>
Fig. 11 is a second explanatory drawing showing the operation of the vehicle headlamp mounting structure according to the present invention. It is referable that the headlamp mounting structure 60 is applied with light-shielding<br><br>
treatment for blocking light from the bulb 62 (See Fig. 8) off by extending the surface of generally spherical shape by providing extension 74 extended at least from the upper end of the lens 64, and by making the extension 74 follow the cover 69 extended from the lamp case 63.<br>
[0032]<br>
For example, if the light-shielding treatment can be applied to the lens 64 without using a special member, the cost of the headlamp 61 may be reduced.<br>
Therefore, light-shielding treatment is applied to the lens 64 and the cost of the headlamp 61 is reduced by extending the surface of the lens 64 in generally spherical shape by providing the extension 74 extended at least from the upper end of the lens 64 , and making the extension 74 follow the cover 69 extended from the lamp case 63.<br>
The lens may be formed in the shape of a large dome by forming the extension 7 4 integrally with the upper end of the lens 64 to extend the surface of generally spherical shape. As a consequent, the possibility of design at the front portion of the vehicle may be enhanced.<br>
As shown in the figure, the headlamp 61 does not disturb the driver M even though the lens 64 surface facing upward.<br>
[0033]<br>
In this embodiment, though the lens 64 is formed into a spherical shape as shown in Fig. 3, this spherical shape must<br><br>
only be generally spherical shape as a whole (overall near-spherical shape).<br>
[0034] [Advantages]<br>
The present invention achieves the following effects by the construction described above.<br>
According to Claim 1, in a vehicle headlamp mounting structure for mounting the headlamp comprising a lamp case supporting a bulb and including a reflecting surface and a lens covering thereon so as to be capable of swinging about an aiming shaft with the lens exposed from the front opening of the vehicle body cover, the lens is formed into a generally spherical surface as a whole, and is formed with spherical portions in the vicinity of the upper edge and the lower edge of the front opening so that it follows the circular arc having a center at the aiming shaft. Therefore, for example the clearance between the lens and the front opening may be minimized. As a consequent, the design of the vehicle may be improved and entering of water or dust into the clearance between the headlamp and the vehicle body cover covering the headlamp is prevented.<br>
[0035]<br>
According to Claim 2, since light-shielding treatment for blocking light from the bulb is applied by extending the surface of generally spherical shape by providing an extension<br><br>
extending at least from the upper end of the lens and making the extension follow the cover extended from the lamp case, the cost of the headlamp may be reduced.<br>
The lens may be formed in the shape of a large dome by forming the extension integrally with the upper end of the lens to extend the surface of generally spherical shape. As a consequent, the possibility of design at the front portion of the vehicle may be enhanced.<br>
[0036]<br>
According to Claim 3, since the cover is extended to both side surfaces of the lamp case, and supporting bosses are provided on both of these side surfaces, rigidity of the lamp case may be increased * Since the supporting bosses are provided on the lamp ca.se with increased rigidity, and the supporting bosses are also used as an aiming shaft, the accuracy of the aiming adjustment (adjustment of optical axis) of the headlamp is improved.<br>
[0037]<br>
According to Claim 4, the supporting bosses are positioned above the optical axis of the bulb and the headlamp is suspended by the supporting bosses, so that the weight balance of the headlamp can be maintained. As a consequent, the supporting stability of the headlamp is realized.<br><br>

We Claim:<br>
1.	A vehicle headlamp mounting structure for mounting a headlamp<br>
comprising a lamp case supporting a bulb and including a reflecting surface<br>
and a lens covering thereon so as to be capable of swinging about an aiming<br>
shaft with the lens exposed from the front opening of the vehicle body cover;<br>
wherein the lens is formed into a generally spherical surface as a whole, and is formed with spherical portions in the vicinity of the upper edge and the lower edge of the front opening so that it follows the circular arc having a center at the aiming shaft.<br>
2.	A vehicle headlamp mounting structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein light-shielding treatment for blocking light from the bulb is applied by extending the surface of generally spherical shape by providing an extension extending at least from the upper end of the lens and making the extension follow the cover extended from the lamp case.<br>
3.	A vehicle headlamp mounting structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein the cover is extended to both side surfaces of the lamp case, supporting bosses are provided on both of these side surfaces, and these supporting bosses are also used as an aiming shaft.<br>
4.	A vehicle headlamp mounting structure as claimed in claim 1, wherein the supporting bosses are positioned above the optical axis of the bulb.<br>
5.	A vehicle headlamp mounting structure for mounting a headlamp substantially as hereinbefore described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br><br><br></td>
