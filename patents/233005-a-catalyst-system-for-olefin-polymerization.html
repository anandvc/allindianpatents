				<td>CATALYST FOR OLEFIN POLYMERlZATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to catalyst used for olefin polymerizations,<br>
especially ethylene polymerization.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The use of an aluminoxane as a cocatalyst for ethylene<br>
polymerization catalyst was reported by Manyik et al in United States<br>
Patent (USP) 3,231,550.<br>
Subsequently, Kamisky and Sinn discovered that aluminoxanes are<br>
excellent cocatalysts for metallocene catalysts, as disclosed in USP<br>
4,404,344.<br>
The use of a supported aluminoxane/metallocene catalyst is further<br>
described in, for example, USP 4,808.561.<br>
However, aluminoxanes are expensive materials so it is desirable to<br>
optimize the use thereof.<br>
The use of phosphated and/or sulfated metal oxides has been<br>
proposed to improve the performance of chromium oxide polymerization<br>
catalysts. See, for example, USP 4,364,839; 4,444,966; and 4,619,980.<br>
We have now discovered that the use of a sulfated metal oxide<br>
support substantially improves the activity of ethylene polymerization<br>
catalysts when used with an aluminoxane cocatalyst.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a catalyst system for olefin<br>
polymerization comprising:<br>
a) a catalyst support component comprising aluminoxane which<br>
is deposited on a sulfated metal oxide; and<br>
b) an organometallic complex of a group 4 metal.<br>
In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process to<br>
prepare a catalyst system for olefin polymerization comprising:<br>
a) preparing a sulfated metal oxide by contacting a metal oxide<br>
with sulfuric acid;<br>
b) preparing a catalyst support component by depositing<br>
aluminoxane upon said sulfated metal oxide; and<br>
c) depositing an organometallic complex of a group 4 metal<br>
upon said catalyst support component.<br>
The present invention also provides a process to prepare<br>
polyolefins using the catalyst technology of this invention.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The use of metal oxide supports in the preparation of olefin<br>
polymerization catalysts is known to those skilled in the art. An exemplary<br>
list of suitable metal oxides includes oxides of aluminum, silicon,<br>
zirconium, zinc and titanium. Alumina, silica and silica-alumina are metal<br>
oxides which are well known for use in olefin polymerization catalysts and<br>
are preferred for reasons of cost and convenience. Silica is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
It is preferred that the metal oxide have a particle size of from about<br>
1 to about 200 microns. It is especially preferred that the particle size be<br>
between about 30 and 100 microns if the catalyst is to be used in a gas<br>
phase or slurry polymerization process and that a smaller particle size<br>
(less than 10 microns) be used if the catalyst is used in a solution<br>
polymerization.<br>
Conventional porous metal oxides which have comparatively high<br>
surface areas (greater than 1 m2/g, particularly greater than 100 m2/g,<br>
more particularly greater than 200 m2/g) are preferred to non-porous metal<br>
oxides.<br>
The sulfated metal oxides used in this invention are prepared by<br>
directly treating the metal oxide with a material having an SO4 group (such<br>
as sulfuric acid). Other exemplary (non-limiting) sulfating agents include<br>
simple salts of sulfate (such as sodium or calcium sulfate) and ammonium<br>
sulfate.<br>
The sulfated metal oxide may be calcined using conventional<br>
calcining techniques (for example, heating the sulfated metal oxide at a<br>
temperature of from 20 to 800°C for from 1 to 24 hours).<br>
Aluminoxanes are readily available items of commerce which are<br>
known to be cocatalysts for olefin polymerization catalysts (especially<br>
group 4 metal metallocene catalysts). A generally accepted formula to<br>
represent aluminoxanes is:<br>
(R)2 AIO(RAIO)m AI(R)2<br>
wherein each R is independently an alkyl group having from 1 to 8 carbon<br>
atoms and m is between 0 and about 50. The preferred aluminoxane is<br>
methylaluminoxane wherein R is predominantly methyl. Commercially<br>
available methylaluminoxane ("MAO") and "modified MAO" are preferred<br>
for use in this invention. [Note: In "modified MAO", the R groups of the<br>
above formula are predominantly methyl but a small fraction of the R<br>
groups are higher hydrocarbyls - such as ethyl, butyl or octyl - so as to<br>
improve the solubility of the "modified MAO" in aliphatic solvents.]<br>
The sulfated metal oxide and aluminoxane are contacted together<br>
so as to form the catalyst component of this invention. This is preferably<br>
done using conventional techniques such as mixing the aluminoxane and<br>
sulfated metal oxide together in an aliphatic or aromatic hydrocarbon (such<br>
as hexane or toluene) at a temperature of from 10 to 200°C for a time of<br>
from 1 minute to several hours. The amount of aluminoxane is preferably<br>
sufficient to provide from 1 to 40 weight % aluminoxane (based on the<br>
combined weight of the aluminoxane and the sulfated metal oxide).<br>
The resulting catalyst component is suitable for use in olefin<br>
polymerization reactions when combined with a polymerization catalyst.<br>
These catalysts contain a group 4 metal. It is especially preferred to<br>
provide an AI:M mole ratio of from 10:1 to 200:1, especially 50:1 to 150:1<br>
in the finished catalyst complex (where Al is the aluminum provided by the<br>
aluminoxane and M is the group 4 metal). The catalyst component (i.e.<br>
the sulfated metal oxide/aluminoxane) may be combined with the<br>
polymerization catalyst using techniques which are conventionally used to<br>
prepare supported aluminoxane/metallocene catalysts. Such techniques<br>
are well known to those skilled in the art. In general, a hydrocarbon slurry<br>
of the catalyst component may be contacted with the catalyst complex. It<br>
is preferred to use a hydrocarbon in which the catalyst complex is soluble.<br>
The examples illustrate suitable techniques to prepare the "catalyst<br>
systems" of this invention. Particularly preferred catalysts are<br>
organometallic complexes of a group 4 metal, as defined by the formula:<br><br>
wherein M is selected from titanium, hafnium and zirconium; L1 and L2 are<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of cyclopentadienyl,<br>
substituted cyclopentadienyl (including indenyl and fluorenyl) and<br>
heteroatom ligands, with the proviso that L1 and L2 may optionally be<br>
bridged together so as to form a bidentate ligand. It is further preferred<br>
that n=2 (i.e. that there are 2 monoanionic activatable ligands).<br>
As previously noted, each of L1 and L2 may independently be a<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand or a heteroatom ligand. Preferred catalysts<br>
include metallocenes (where both L1 and L2 are cyclopentadienyl ligands<br>
which may be substituted and/or bridged) and monocyclopentadienyl-<br>
heteroatom catalysts (especially a catalyst having a cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligand and a phosphinimine ligand), as illustrated in the Examples.<br>
Brief descriptions of exemplary ligands are provided below.<br>
Cyclopentadienyl Ligands<br>
L1 and L2 may each independently be a cyclopentadienyl ligand. As<br>
used herein, the term cyclopentadienyl ligand is meant to convey its broad<br>
meaning, namely a substituted or unsubstituted ligand having a five<br>
carbon ring which is bonded to the metal via eta-5 bonding. Thus, the<br>
term cyclopentadienyl includes unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, substituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted indenyl, substituted indenyl, unsubstituted<br>
fluorenyl and substituted fluorenyl. An exemplary list of substituents for a<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand includes the group consisting of 1) C1-10<br>
hydrocarbyl radical (which hydrocarbyl radicals are unsubstituted or further<br>
substituted); 2) a halogen atom; 3) C1-8 alkoxy radical; 4) a C6-10 aryl or<br>
aryloxy radical; 5) an amido radical which is unsubstituted or substituted<br>
by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; 6) a phosphido radical which is<br>
unsubstituted or substituted by up to two C1-8 alkyl radicals; 7) silyl radicals<br>
of the formula -Si-(R1)3 wherein each R1 is independently selected from<br>
the group consisting of hydrogen, a C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical C6-10 aryl or<br>
aryloxy radicals; and 8) germanyl radicals of the formula Ge-(R1)3 wherein<br>
R1 is as defined directly above.<br>
Activatable Ligands<br>
L3 is an activatable ligand. The term "activatable ligand" refers to a<br>
ligand which may be activated by a cocatalyst or "activator" (e.g. the<br>
aluminoxane) to facilitate olefin polymerization. Exemplary activatable<br>
ligands include selected from the group consisting of 1) a hydrogen atom;<br>
2) a halogen atom; 3) a C1-10 hydrocarbyl; 4) a C1-10 alkoxy; 5) a C5-10 aryl<br>
oxide; 6) an amido; and 7) a phosphido.<br>
The number of activatable ligands depends upon the valency of the<br>
metal and the valency of the activatable ligand. As previously noted, the<br>
preferred catalysts contain a group 4 metal in the highest oxidation state<br>
(i.e. 4+) and the preferred activatable ligands are monoanionic (such as a<br>
halide - especially chloride, or an alkyl - especially methyl). Thus, the<br>
preferred catalyst contains two activatable ligands. In some instances, the<br>
metal of the catalyst component may not be in the highest oxidation state.<br>
For example, a titanium (III) component would contain only one activatable<br>
ligand. Also, it is permitted to use a dianionic activatable ligand although<br>
this is not preferred.<br>
Heteroatom Ligands<br>
As used herein, the term heteroatom ligand refers to a ligand which<br>
contains a heteroatom selected from the group consisting of nitrogen,<br>
boron, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. The ligand may be sigma or pi<br>
bonded to the metal. Exemplary heteroatom ligands include<br>
phosphinimine ligands, ketimide ligands, siloxy ligands, amido ligands,<br>
alkoxy ligands, boron heterocyclic ligands and phosphole ligands. Brief<br>
descriptions of such ligands follow:<br>
Phosphinimine Liqands<br>
Phosphinimine ligands are defined by the formula:<br><br>
wherein each R1 is independently selected from the group consisting of a<br>
hydrogen atom, a halogen atom, C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals which are<br>
unsubstituted by or further substituted by a halogen atom, a C1-8 alkoxy<br>
radical, a C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radical, an amido radical, a silyl radical of the<br>
formula: <br>
wherein each R2 is independently selected from the group consisting of<br>
hydrogen, a C1-8 alkyl or alkoxy radical, C6-10 aryl or aryloxy radicals, and a<br>
germanyl radical of the formula:<br><br>
wherein R2 is as defined above.<br>
The preferred phosphinimines are those in which each R1 is a<br>
hydrocarbyl radical. A particularly preferred phosphinimine is tri-(tertiary<br>
butyl) phosphinimine (i.e. where each R1 is a tertiary butyl group).<br>
Ketimide Liqands<br>
As used herein, the term "ketimide ligand" refers to a ligand which:<br>
(a) is bonded to the group 4 metal via a metal-nitrogen atom<br>
bond;<br>
(b) has a single substituent on the nitrogen atom, (where this<br>
single substituent is a carbon atom which is doubly bonded to the N atom);<br>
and<br>
(c) has two substituents (Sub 1 and Sub 2, described below)<br>
which are bonded to the carbon atom.<br>
Conditions a, b, and c are illustrated below:<br><br>
The substituents "Sub 1" and "Sub 2" may be the same or different.<br>
Exemplary substituents include hydrocarbyls having from 1 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms; silyl groups, amido groups and phosphido groups. For reasons of<br>
cost and convenience it is preferred that these substituents both be<br>
hydrocarbyls, especially simple alkyls and most preferably tertiary butyl.<br>
Siloxv Heteroliqands<br>
These ligands are defined by the formula:<br><br>
where the - denotes a bond to the transition metal and u is sulfur or<br>
oxygen.<br>
The substituents on the Si atom, namely Rx, Ry and Rz are required<br>
in order to satisfy the bonding orbital of the Si atom. The use of any<br>
particular substituent Rx, Ry or Rz is not especially important to the<br>
success of this invention. It is preferred that each of Rx, Ry and Rz is a C1-4<br>
hydrocarbyl group such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl or tertiary butyl (simply<br>
because such materials are readily synthesized from commercially<br>
available materials).<br>
Amido Ligands<br>
The term "amido" is meant to convey its broad, conventional<br>
meaning. Thus, these ligands are characterized by (a) a metal-nitrogen<br>
bond, and (b) the presence of two substituents (which are typically simple<br>
alkyl or silyl groups) on the nitrogen atom. The amido ligand may be<br>
bridged (for example, to a cyclopentadienyl group so as to form a<br>
bidentate ligand.<br>
Alkoxv Ligands<br>
The term "alkoxy" is also intended to convey its conventional<br>
meaning. Thus these ligands are characterized by (a) a metal oxygen<br>
bond, and (b) the presence of a hydrocarbyl group bonded to the oxygen<br>
atom. The hydrocarbyl group may be a ring structure and/or substituted<br>
(e.g. 2, 6 di-tertiary butyl phenoxy).<br>
Boron Heterocyclic Ligands<br>
These ligands are characterized by the presence of a boron atom in<br>
a closed ring ligand. This definition includes heterocyclic ligands which<br>
also contain a nitrogen atom in the ring. These ligands are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art of olefin polymerization and are fully described in<br>
the literature (see, for example, USP's 5,637,659; 5,554,775 and the<br>
references cited therein).<br>
Phosphole Ligands<br>
The term "phosphole" is also meant to convey its conventional<br>
meaning. "Phosphole" is also meant to convey its conventional meaning.<br>
"Phospholes" are cyclic dienyl structures having four carbon atoms and<br>
one phosphorus atom in the closed ring. The simplest phosphole is C4PH4<br>
(which is analogous to cyclopentadiene with one carbon in the ring being<br>
replaced by phosphorus). The phosphole ligands may be substituted with,<br>
for example, C1-20 hydrocarbyl radicals (which may, optionally, contain<br>
halogen substituents); phosphido radicals; amido radicals; silyl or alkoxy<br>
radicals.<br>
Phosphole ligands are also well known to those skilled in the art of<br>
olefin polymerization and are described as such in USP 5,434,116 (Sone,<br>
to Tosoh).<br>
Polymerization Processes<br>
This invention is suitable for use in any conventional olefin<br>
polymerization process, such as the so-called "gas phase", "slurry", "high<br>
pressure" or "solution" polymerization processes. Polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene and ethylene propylene elastomers are examples of olefin<br>
polymers which may be produced according to this invention.<br>
The preferred polymerization process according to this invention<br>
uses ethylene and may include other monomers which are<br>
copolymerizable therewith such as other alpha olefins (having from three<br>
to ten carbon atoms, preferably butene, hexene or octene) and, under<br>
certain conditions, dienes such as hexadiene isomers, vinyl aromatic<br>
monomers such as styrene or cyclic olefin monomers such as norbornene.<br>
The present invention may also be used to prepare elastomeric co-<br>
and terpolymers of ethylene, propylene and optionally one or more diene<br>
monomers. Generally, such elastomeric polymers will contain about 50 to<br>
abut 75 weight % ethylene, preferably about 50 to 60 weight % ethylene<br>
and correspondingly from 50 to 25% of propylene. A portion of the<br>
monomers, typically the propylene monomer, may be replaced by a<br>
conjugated diolefin. The diolefin may be present in amounts up to 10<br>
weight % of the polymer although typically is present in amounts from<br>
about 3 to 5 weight %. The resulting polymer may have a composition<br>
comprising from 40 to 75 weight % of ethylene, from 50 to 15 weight % of<br>
propylene and up to 10 weight % of a diene monomer to provide 100<br>
weight % of the polymer. Preferred but not limiting examples of the dienes<br>
are dicyclopentadiene, 1,4-hexadiene, 5-methylene-2-norbornene, 5-<br>
ethylidene-2-norbornene and 5-vinyl-2-norbornene. Particularly preferred<br>
dienes are 5-ethylidene-2-norbornene and 1,4-hexadiene.<br>
The polyethylene polymers which may be prepared in accordance<br>
with the present invention typically comprise not less than 60, preferably<br>
not less than 70 weight % of ethylene and the balance one or more C4-10<br>
alpha olefins, preferably selected from the group consisting of 1-butene, 1-<br>
hexene and 1 -octene. The polyethylene prepared in accordance with the<br>
present invention may be linear low density polyethylene having density<br>
from about 0.910 to 0.935 g/cc. The present invention might also be<br>
useful to prepare polyethylene having a density below 0.910 g/cc, the so-<br>
called very low and ultra low density polyethylenes.<br>
The catalyst of this invention is preferably used in a slurry<br>
polymerization process or a gas phase polymerization process.<br>
A typical slurry polymerization process uses total reactor pressures<br>
of up to about 50 bars and reactor temperature of up to about 200°C. The<br>
process employs a liquid medium (e.g. an aromatic such as toluene or an<br>
alkane such as hexane, propane or isobutane) in which the polymerization<br>
takes place. This results in a suspension of solid polymer particles in the<br>
medium. Loop reactors are widely used in slurry processes. Detailed<br>
descriptions of slurry polymerization processes are widely reported in the<br>
open and patent literature.<br>
In general, a fluidized bed gas phase polymerization reactor<br>
employs a "bed" of polymer and catalyst which is fluidized by a flow of<br>
monomer which is at least partially gaseous. Heat is generated by the<br>
enthalpy of polymerization of the monomer flowing through the bed.<br>
Unreacted monomer exits the fluidized bed and is contacted with a cooling<br>
system to remove this heat. The cooled monomer is then re-circulated<br>
through the polymerization zone together with "make-up" monomer to<br>
replace that which was polymerized on the previous pass. As will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art, the "fluidized" nature of the<br>
polymerization bed helps to evenly distribute/mix the heat of reaction and<br>
thereby minimize the formation of localized temperature gradients (or "hot<br>
spots"). Nonetheless, it is essential that the heat of reaction be properly<br>
removed so as to avoid softening or melting of the polymer (and the<br>
resultant-and highly undesirable - "reactor chunks"). The obvious way to<br>
maintain good mixing and cooling is to have a very high monomer flow<br>
through the bed. However, extremely high monomer flow causes<br>
undesirable polymer entrainment.<br>
An alternative (and preferable) approach to high monomer flow is<br>
the use of an inert condensable fluid which will boil in the fluidized bed<br>
(when exposed to the enthalpy of polymerization), then exit the fluidized<br>
bed as a gas, then come into contact with a cooling element which<br>
condenses the inert fluid. The condensed, cooled fluid is then returned to<br>
the polymerization zone and the boiling/condensing cycle is repeated.<br>
The above-described use of a condensable fluid additive in a gas<br>
phase polymerization is often referred to by those skilled in the art as<br>
"condensed mode operation" and is described in additional detail in USP<br>
4,543,399 and USP 5,352,749. As noted in the '399 reference, it is<br>
permissible to use alkanes such as butane, pentanes or hexanes as the<br>
condensable fluid and the amount of such condensed fluid preferably does<br>
not exceed about 20 weight per cent of the gas phase.<br>
Other reaction conditions for the polymerization of ethylene which<br>
are reported in the '399 reference are:<br>
Preferred Polymerization Temperatures: about 75°C to about<br>
115°C (with the lower temperatures being preferred for lower<br>
melting copolymers - especially those having densities of less than<br>
0.915 g/cc - and the higher temperatures being preferred for higher<br>
density copolymers and homopolymers); and<br>
Pressure: up to about 1000 psi (with a preferred range of from<br>
about 100 to 350 psi for olefin polymerization).<br>
The '399 reference teaches that the fluidized bed process is well<br>
adapted for the preparation of polyethylene but further notes that other<br>
monomers may be employed - as is the case in the polymerization<br>
process of this invention.<br>
Further details are provided by the following non-limiting examples.<br>

Part A Preparation of Sulfated Supports<br>
Example S1<br>
To an aqueous solution of (NH4)2SO4 (100 mmol) at room<br>
temperature was added silica (50 g sold under the tradename XPO-2408<br>
from W.R. Grace). The water was then removed by vacuum pumping.<br>
The solid was dried in a 135°C oven overnight to remove most of the<br>
water. The free flowing material was calcined at 200°C for 2 hours under<br>
air and then at 600°C for 6 hours under nitrogen. The modified silica<br>
obtained was used as carrier for catalyst preparation.<br>
Example S2<br>
The procedure was the same as in S1, but 3 mmol of (NH4)2SO4<br>
per gram of silica gel was used.<br>
Example S3<br>
Same as S1 except the dehydration temperature was at 200°C for<br>
two hours under air and at 330°C for 6 hours under nitrogen.<br>
Example S4<br>
H2SO4 (95-98%, 14.72 g, 150 mmol) was added drop-wise to a<br>
slurry of silica (XPO-2408; 50 g) agitated gently by hand in deionized<br>
distilled water (-250 ml) at room temperature. The solvent was removed<br>
using a rotary evaporator until the product was a loose solid. The solid<br>
was transferred to a beaker and dried in a 135°C oven over a weekend to<br>
remove most of the water. The free flowing material was then heated at<br>
200°C under air for 2 hours and calcined at 600°C under nitrogen for 6<br>
hours. The calcined silica (observed to be slightly discolored) was stored<br>
in a glove box for further use.<br>
Example S5<br>
H2SO4 (95-98%, 4.9 g, 50 mmol) was dissolved in ethanol (300 ml).<br>
Silica gel (50 g) was slurried into the solution. The solvent was pumped to<br>
dryness and the remaining material was calcined at 200°C under air for<br>
two hours and at 600°C under nitrogen for 6 hours.<br>
Example S6<br>
H2SO4 (95-98%, 0.490 g, 5 mmol) was added drop-wise to a slurry<br>
of previously calcined silica (XPO-2408; 10 g) slurried in anhydrous<br>
heptane (-150 ml) by overhead mechanical stirrer at ~300 rpm. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred overnight. The solid was collected by<br>
filtration, washed thoroughly with heptane and dried under vacuum. The<br>
sulfated silica was sieved and stored in a glove box for further use.<br>
Example S7<br>
H2SO4 (95-98%, 29.44 g, 300 mmol) and silica (100 g) were used<br>
with the same procedure as in Example S4. After dehydration, 104 g<br>
product was obtained.<br>
Example S8 - Comparative<br>
H3PO4 (85 wt % in water, 3.4 ml, 50 mmol) diluted in deionized<br>
distilled water (-100 ml) was added dropwise to a slurry of silica agitated<br>
vigorously by mechanical overhead stirrer at room temperature. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature over a weekend. The<br>
solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator until the product was a<br>
loose solid. The modified silica was transferred to a beaker and dried in a<br>
135°C oven overnight to remove most of the water. The free flowing silica<br>
was then heated at 200°C under air for 2 hours and then calcined at 600°C<br>
under nitrogen for 6 hours. The product was gray in color, and some<br>
chunks were present. The calcined silica was stored in a glove box for<br>
further use.<br>
Example S9<br>
H2SO4 (95-98%, 5.89 g, 60 mmol) was added drop-wise to a slurry<br>
of aluminum oxide (activated, basic, Brockmann I, purchased from Sigma-<br>
Aldrich, 20 g) in deionized distilled water (-125 ml) agitated by mechanical<br>
overhead stirrer (-200 rpm) at room temperature. A slight warming of the<br>
reaction vessel was detected during the course of addition, and the solid<br>
became a peach color. After complete addition, the mixture was stirred an<br>
additional 15 minutes at room temperature. The solvent was removed<br>
using a rotary evaporator until the product was a loose solid. The particle<br>
size of the solid was reduced in a mortar and pestle to produce a free<br>
flowing material. The modified aluminum oxide was then transferred to a<br>
beaker, and was dried in a 200°C oven over a weekend to remove most of<br>
the water. The free flowing sulfated aluminum oxide was heated at 200°C<br>
under air for 2 hours and then calcined at 600°C under nitrogen for 6<br>
hours. The calcined aluminum oxide was sieved to remove large solids<br>
and stored in a glove box for further use (18.5 g).<br>
Part B Preparation of Supported Catalysts<br>
Part 1 Preparation of Catalyst Component<br>
General procedure: Toluene was deoxygenated and dried (through<br>
columns of alumina, deoxo catalyst and activated molecular sieves under<br>
nitrogen) prior to use. Unless otherwise specified, the toluene and other<br>
solvents (e.g. heptane) are dried and deoxygenated this way. The support<br>
material (silica "XPO-2408" or modified support) was weighted into a 100<br>
ml flask and toluene was added to make a slurry. A solution of<br>
methyaluminoxane (a commercially available material, sold under the<br>
tradename "PMAO-IP" by Akzo Nobel or "AB-MAO" by Albemarle) was<br>
added to the slurry while the slurry was stirred with a mechanical stirrer or<br>
with a minimum stirring speed with a magnetic stirrer.<br>
Part 2 Preparation of Supported Catalyst Systems<br>
The catalyst component slurry from Part 1 was stirred for 16 hours,<br>
which was filtered to remove the supernatant, and the solid was re-slurried<br>
into toluene. A solution of a catalyst complex (sufficient to provide an AI:Ti<br>
or AI:Zr molar ratio of approximately 120:1) was added slowly to the slurry.<br>
The combined mixture was stirred for 2 hours at room temperature and an<br>
additional 2 hours at 45°C. The catalyst system solids were recovered by<br>
filtration and washed with small amounts of toluene for 3 times. The<br>
catalyst was dried under vacuum and sieved.<br>
Part C Bench Scale Polymerization Operating Conditions<br>
Polymerization of Ethylene<br>
General procedures: All polymerization work was conducted by<br>
using a 2 litre, stirred, autoclave reactor running in a gas phase mode of<br>
operation. Polymerizations were conducted at 80 to 90°C under a total<br>
reaction pressure of 200 pounds per square inch gauge ("psig"). A seed<br>
bed of dry NaCI (160 g) was used. A specified amount of 25% solution of<br>
tri-isobutyl aluminum (TIBAL) was used as a poison scavenger. Some<br>
copolymerizations were studied by injecting hexene into the reactor.<br>
After the addition of scavenger (and optionally, co-monomer),<br>
ethylene was used to push the catalyst system into the reactor and to<br>
bring the reactor pressure to the total pressure of 200 psig. Typical<br>
polymerization conditions are summarized in Table 1.<br>
Polymerization Examples<br>
Examples 1-3<br>
Sulfated supports S1, S2 and S3 (made by calcining<br>
SiO2/(NH4)2SO4) were used to support (t-Bu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2. Substantial<br>
activity enhancement of catalyst activity was observed in comparison to<br>
the activity of the same phosphinimine catalyst on a standard (untreated)<br>
support. The results are in Table 2.<br>
Examples 4-12<br>
Supports S4 and S5 made by calcining SiO2/H2SO4 were used for<br>
supporting (t-Bu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2. Significant catalyst activity enhancement<br>
was observed.<br>
Examples 13-14<br>
A support made by treatment of calcined silica with H2SO4 in non-<br>
aqueous environment was used for supporting (t-Bu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2.<br>
Examples 15-17<br>
Sulfated silica S7 obtained by calcining sulfuric acid and silica was<br>
used with (n-BuCp)2ZrCI2 and AB-MAO. Substantial activity enhancement<br>
was again observed in comparison to the activity of the same zirconocene<br>
catalyst on standard (untreated) silica. The experiment with the<br>
zirconocene and the comparative, untreated silica support, is shown as C2<br>
in Table 2.<br>
Comparative Examples C3 and C4<br>
Phosphated silica supports obtained by treatment of silica with<br>
phosphoric acid followed by dehydration were used with (t-<br>
Bu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2 and PMAO. Activity enhancement was also observed<br>
but not as good as sulfated silica supports.<br>
Example 18<br>
Sulfated alumina was used with (t-Bu3PN)(lnd)TiCI2 and PMAO. An<br>
activity of 49,127 gPE/mmolTi[C2]hrwas observed.<br>
