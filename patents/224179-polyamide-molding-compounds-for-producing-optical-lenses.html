POLYAMIDE MOLDING COMPOUNDS FOR PRODUCING OPTICAL LENSES;<br>
EMS-CHEMIE AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS REICHENAUERSTRASSE, CH-7013, DOMAT/ERNS, SWITZERLAND;<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES        AND<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFOMED.<br><br>
POLYAMIDE MOLDING COMPOUNDS FOR PRODUCING OPTICAL LENSES<br>
The invention relates to new thermoplastically processible transparent polyamide molding materials based on copolyamides containing diamines and dicarboxylic acids with aromatic cores which exhibit a high index of refraction nD20 over 1.59, preferably over 1.60, and a low density under 1.3 g/cm3. At the same time, a low birefringence, high hardness, and scratchresistance are achieved.<br>
The inventive polyamide molding materials are fabricated by means of conventional pressure reactors (autoclaves) according to a modified technique. The granulate that is produced from the inventive molding materials is reshaped by thermoplastic processes like injection molding, particularly in multichamber cavity tools.<br>
The invention also relates to the utilization of the inventive molding materials based on special copolyamides for producing optical lenses. For optical lenses, a very low birefringence is desired in order to prevent the formation of color rings or unsharp pictures.<br>
The term "transparent polyamides" refers herein to (co)polyamide(s) (i.e. molding materials therefrom) whose transmission factor equals at least 70% when the polyamide is in the form of a thin lens with a thickness of 2 mm.<br>
Optical lens blanks are manufactured primarily from high-shrinkage casting resins which are hardened for several hours in a mold by UV-activated hardeners. The curing process is frequently associated with a volume loss of 20% or more. Complex geometries can no longer be demolded. An advantage of this method is that the casting resins can be loaded with components that achieve high indexes of refraction of&gt;1.60 and high hardnesses and heat distortion temperatures. The high hardness protects the material against surface damage. The main disadvantage consists in the long curing times, which can last up to 40 hours, and the relatively complicated formulations, which are poured into high-purity molds.<br>
The speed of fabrication rises many times over for optical lenses that can be molded according to the injection molding method. Handling is much easier compared to the reactive casting resins. Highly complicated geometries can be produced. With<br><br>
the known technique of back injection, composites with other polyamides can be produced. Today, mainly amorphous plastics like PMMA polymethylmethacrylate) or PC (polycarbonate) are utilized for lenses. An advantage of PMMA is the low processing temperature, high transparency, and high hardness. Its disadvantages are the low heat distortion temperature and low index of refraction nD20 of 1.49. The advantage of PC is its excellent viscosity and an average index of refraction of 1.59. On the other hand, its disadvantages are its low hardness and low chemical resistance.<br>
PS (polystyrols) or COC (cycloolefin copolymers) with high heat distortion temperatures are additional amorphous plastics which are suitable for lens production. Their indexes of refraction show similar values as polycarbonate. The disadvantages of polystyrol are its low toughness, low heat distortion temperature, and low chemical resistance.<br>
In order to set higher indexes of refraction and lower dispersion, corresponding additives with a high electron density and high polarizing capability can be added to the cited molding compounds. In general, heavy atoms such as iodine or metal salts in suitable compounds can be utilized for this. Alternatively, surface varnishes can be used, which improve properties such as index of refraction, dispersion, transmission, and hardness.<br>
Normally, thermoplastic, semi-crystalline and thus non-transparent polyamide molding compounds consisting substantially ofaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic diamines are produced in the pressure autoclaves that are customary for polyamide production. In these methods, temperatures between 250 and 350° C and pressures between 10 and 20 bars are applied. At the end of the reaction, a polymer melt is formed, which is discharged in strand form by nozzles, cooled in a water bath, and cut into granulate. The granulate is then re-melted in extruders and reformed into extrusion or injection molded products.<br>
Transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding compounds are produced from monomers according to the same method, whereby crystallite formation is suppressed by comonomers. Products with a high proportion ofaromatics frequently comprise high glass temperatures and high viscosities and can no longer be discharged from the<br><br>
autoclaves owing to low fluidity. In order to increase the fluidity, aliphatic comonomers are integrated, which reduce the glass temperature.<br>
However, thermoplastic transparent polyamide molding materials for optical applications with indexes of refraction nD20 over 1.6, densities under 1.3 g/cm3, high hardness and low glass transition temperature which can be produced from the melt in an autoclaving method and processed in injection molding systems are not yet known.<br>
US-A-4,843,141 describes thermoplastic polyester amides which are produced according to known autoclaving processes with 2,2-substituted biphenyl radicals which are suitable for producing films and fibers. The formation of anisotropic melts up to 350° C is an essential feature. In US-A-4,355,132, anisotropic melts are achieved up to 400° C. m both cases, the liquid-crystalline characteristics are in the foreground.<br>
US-A-4,446,305 describes possible modules for transparent polyamides with indexes of refraction of up to 2.0. The object is the fabrication of transparent products with high birefringence. The production is performed from solution, usually a solution ofN-methylpyrolidone similarly to US-A-4,384,107 and US-A-4,520,189 at low temperatures on lab scale, whereby preferably aromatic reactive acid chlorides are utilized, which react with diamines even at room temperature. The disadvantage here is that the solvent has to be removed, and the removal of the HC l requires complicated washing steps. The special dicarboxylic acids or diamines that are needed for setting high indices of refraction normally do not comprise sufficient thermal stability for a melt condensation in an autoclaving process at 200 to 300° C.<br>
Various transparent products based on polyimide and polyetherimide with Tg&gt;235° C are known from US-A-4,216,321 and must be produced from solvent at low temperatures and remolded in order to prevent thermal damage or discoloration.<br>
US-A-5,049,156 describes transparent polyamides with imide structures for lenses which are built from aromatic tetracarboxylic acids and aromatic diamines which are converted into amino acids at 80° C in organic solvents. When the solvent is distilled off under a vacuum, ring closure occurs, whereby imide is formed. Corresponding molded bodies or films are produced from solution and can be remolded in heated presses at 200 to 400° C and cured. The resulting indexes of refraction nD20 range from 1.6 to 1.7.<br><br>
EP-A-556 646 describes reactive epoxy casting resins with xylylenediamine components, which resins are utilized for producing cast lenses with indexes of refraction nD20 of 1.58.<br>
GB-A-1420741 describes hydrodynamic contact lenses consisting of transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding compounds with trimethylhexamethylenediamine and terephthalic acid with a higher refractive power than PMMA but with an index of refraction nD20 under 1.59.<br>
The patents JP 09012716 and JP 09012712 describe transparent thermoplastic polyamides that are produced from dimerized or trimerized fatty acids or diamines with 11 to 22 C atoms and ethylenediamine by a polycondensation method. The injection molding yields transparent lenses with a density of 0.957, light transmission of 91.2%, and a relatively low index of refraction nD20 of 1.496.<br>
EP-A-619 336 describes transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding composition that are produced by polycondensation from bis-(4-aminocyclohexyl)methane and up to 65% of another diamine, converted with dodecanoic dicarboxyhc acid. Injection-molded transparent lenses exhibit low indexes of refraction nD20, i.e. about 1.51.<br>
EP-A-837 087 describes transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding composition that are produced by polycondensation from cycloaliphatic C14-C22 diamines with aliphatic C8-Ci4 dicarboxyhc acids or aliphatic C8-Ci4 diamines with cycloaliphatic C7-C36 dicarboxyhc acids, which can be replaced up to 50% by aromatic dicarboxyhc acids. Injection-molded transparent lenses comprise densities of about 1.01 g/cm3, indexes of refraction nD20 of 1.51 and Abbe coefficients of 52.<br>
JP-A-3050264 describes blends of (A) transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding composition that are produced from hexamethylenediamine or alicyclic diamines such as bis-(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)methane or bis-(4-amino-3-methylcyclohexyl)propane and aromatic dicarboxyhc acids such as isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid and (B) aliphatic polyamides such as PA46 (polyamide 46), PA66, PA610, PA6, PA11. Indexes of refraction nD   under 1.59 can be achieved with these systems.<br><br>
JP-A-3033157 describes blends of (A) 90% transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding composition, produced from hexamethylenediamine or alicyclic diamines such as bis-(4-amino-3methylcyclohexyl)methane or propane and aromatic dicarboxylic acids like isophthalic acid or terephthalic acid and (b) 10% semiaromatic polyamide built from aromatic dicarboxylic acids and aliphatic diamines or aliphatic dicarboxylic acids and aromatic diamines. Indexes of refraction nD20 under 1.60 can be achieved with these systems.<br>
JP-A-62204201 describes transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding composition that are produced from caprolactam, hexamethylenediamine and 2,2,4-<br>
trimethylhexamethylenediamine and terephthalic acid (6/6T/3-6T) for optical lenses with the. advantage of a high heat distortion temperature and a high dimensional stability. But the index of refraction nD20 is far below 1.6.<br>
EP-A-345 810 describes colorless transparent polyamides for lenses that are produced from 2,2-bis(3,4 dicarboxyphenyl)hexafluoropropanedianhydride and aromatic diamines in meta position or 1,4 disubstituted dibenzylmethane or propane or CF3 or S02 in meta position with a refractive index of &gt;1.6. The densities of these lenses are a relatively high 1.33 to 1.44 g/cm3. The disadvantage is the fabrication in organic solvents at 80° C, which require a complicated drying process. The lenses are produced by a casting technique with the aid of solvents. It is not specified whether the material is thermoplastically processible in injection molding machines.<br>
The object of the invention is thus to provide thermoplastic transparent polyamide molding material based on special copolyamides which have a higher refractive index nD20 (&gt;1.6) than PMMA, PC, PS and COC and a low density, which do not exceed the processing temperatures of PC, and which exhibit the highest possible hardness and rigidity.<br>
This object is inventively achieved by the molding composition according to claim 1, the method according to claim 13, and the optical lenses according to claims 17 and 18. Advantageous embodiments of the invention derive from the subclaims.<br>
Surprisingly, the invention establishes that transparent polyamide molding composition based on copolyamides, containing diamines with aromatic cores, with high refractive indices nD20 above 1.6 and very low densities under 1.3 g/cm3, high hardness,<br><br>
low birefringence, and suitable melt viscosity and glass temperatures between 120 and 170° C can be produced from certain combinations of monomers, such as those cited in patent claims 1 to 12, in a pressure autoclave by a modified method. A particular advantage of the inventive polyamide molding material for thermoplastic lens material consists in the simple and rational forming. The fabrication time for lenses in an injection molding method that is customary for polyamides is seconds long, whereas the curing processes for lenses that consist of reactive casting resins require several hours.<br>
The refractive index can be varied broadly by changing the monomer composition of the copolyamide. Materials with different indexes of refraction can be randomly combined in layers according to compound injection molding methods. Finishes of all kinds for stabilization, coloration, strengthening, and so on, can then be incorporated by means of additional compounding methods such as extrusion.<br>
The production of the inventive molding material, i.e. the condensation, occurs on ordinary pressure autoclaves but according to a modified method. What is critical here is that no processing step exceeds 4 bars of pressure in the autoclave. The remolding of the inventive molding material then occurs by ordinary thermoplastic processes. Compared to known materials like PMMA (polymethylmethacrylate) or PC (polycarbonate), optically relevant characteristics like high refractive index, hardness, and high heat distortion temperature were realized in one product. Besides the advantageous combination of characteristics for optical applications, molded parts produced from the inventive molding material have the outstanding chemical resistance for which polyamides are known. For example, for optical lenses, a very low birefringence is desirable in order to prevent color ring formations and unsharp pictures.<br>
The particular advantage of the inventive molding material is the ability to produce complicated optical components by injection molding, for instance, owing to the outstanding fluidity. Furthermore, various combinations of chemically compatible materials are possible in this method, whose optical characteristics can be variably set. This allows the construction of superior technical parts made of resistant polyamides, it being possible to simultaneously integrate a resistant polyamide optical lens into the molded part by exploiting the adhesion of polyamide to polyamide.<br><br>
Another advantage of the inventive molding material is the high refractive index nD20 above 1.6 given at relative low densities below 1.3 g/cm3. This allows the production of light weight but strongly refractive lenses with a substantial comfort advantage.<br>
Further advantage is gained by the high hardness of the material, which greatly simplifies processing steps such as post-processing and grinding of the lens blank and which resembles the standard cast lens material alyldiglycolcarbonate CR39. High hardnesses additionally manifest excellent surface resistance against mechanical damage and can thus obviate surface refining steps such as the cited hardcoats or other protective varnishes.<br>
Further essential advantages of the inventive polyamide molding material are the high' rigidity and hardness of the lenses, whereby the processing and polishing steps are substantially simplified and can be performed with finishes that are used for processing the standard lens CR-39.<br>
Suitable inventive transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding compositions contain aromatic dicarboxylic acids such as isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, or naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, either individually or as a blend, whereby the isophthalic acid forms the largest portion. Of course, the corresponding esters or other substituted derivates can also be utilized. The crystallization behavior can be influenced by the purposeful selection of different symmetrical or asymmetrical isomers of the naphthalene dicarboxylic acid. A portion of the aromatic dicarboxylic acids, i.e. up to 5 mol%, can be replaced by aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with 2 to 12 (CH2) units.<br>
Inventively suitable diamines preferably contain aromatic cores such as meta-xylylene diamine or para-xylylene diamine or come from the aromatic diamine group or the substituted aromatic diamine group and can be used individually or as a blend. The lesser share of the aromatic diamines can be replaced up to 5 mol% by aliphatic or cycloaliphatic diamines with 2 to 12 CH2 groups.<br>
The inventive copolyamide-based transparent thermoplastic polyamide molding materials with a refractive index nD20 above 1.59, preferably above 1.6, contain a predominant proportion by weight of diamines and dicarboxylic acids with aromatic cores, characterized by the following chains, represented by Formula (I):<br>
-{IPS-NH-Rr-NH}nr-{TPS-NH-R2-NH}n2 -{CO-R3-NH}n3 -     (I)<br><br>
where:<br>
n,= 40tol00wt%<br>
n2= 60 to 0 wt%<br>
n3= 0 to 30 wt%, and where the proportions, in wt%, of rii, n2, and n3 total 100%,<br>
whereby the diamines with the cores Rb R2 can be identical or different, and the diamines consist of para-xylylene or meta-xylylene units and can consist of linear aliphatic or branched aliphatic chains with 2 to 12 (CH)2 units or chains with cycloaliphatic cores which are incorporated individually or as blends, and whereby 100 mol% of the dicarboxylic acids consist of at least 40 mol% isophthalic acid (IPS) and, as a residue, terephthalic acid, which can be replaced partly or wholly by naphthalenedicarboxylic acids.<br>
Up to 30 wt% of the copolyamides of the molding compounds can be replaced by amino acids or lactams with core R3, consisting of 5 to 11 (CH2) chain units.<br>

20 to 100 mol% meta-xylylenediamine (MXD)<br>
80 to 0 mol% hexamethylenediamine (6)<br>
50 to 100 mol% isophthalic acid (I) and<br>
50 to 0 mol% terephthalic acid (T) in relation to 100 mol% diamine and 100 mol% dicarboxylic acids, whereby meta-xylylenediamine can be wholly or partly replaced by para-xylylenediamine, and terephthalic acid wholly or partly by naphthalenedicarboxylic acid, whereby symmetric or asymmetric isomers or blends thereof can be utilized. Asymmetric isomers are preferred.<br>
A copolyamide composition according to Formula II is particularly preferred:<br>
MXDI/MXDT/6I/6T (II)<br>
With the following mol% portions of the respective components:<br>
20 to 80 mol% meta-xylylenediamine (MXD) 80 to 20 mol% hexamethylenediamine (6) 60 to 80 mol% isophthalic acid (I) and<br><br>
40 to 20 mol% terephthalic acid (T) in relation to 100 mol% diamine and 100 mol% dicarboxylic acids.<br>
A copolyamide according to Formula III is also particularly preferred:<br>
6I/6T/6NDC       (III)<br>
with the following proportions, in mol%, of the respective components:<br>
20 to 80 mol% naphthalenedicarboxylic acid (NDC), with symmetric or asymmetric substitute positions or combinations thereof, whereby 2,6-naphthalenedicarboxylic acid is preferred,<br>
40 to 20 mol% isophthalic acid (I),<br>
40 to 0 mol% terephthalic acid (T) and<br>
100 mol% hexamethylenediamine (6), which can be wholly or partly replaced by ethylenediamine, trimethylhexamethylenediamine, or linear diamines with 8 to 12 CH2 groups or by cycloaliphatic diamines such as norbomanediamine, 4,4-diaminodicyclohexylmethane, 3,3-dimethyl-4,4-diaminodicyclohexylrnethane or blends thereof, in relation to 100 mol% diamine and 100 mol% dicarboxylic acids.<br>
Inventively suitable diamines with aromatic cores encompass meta-xylylenediamine and/or para-xylylenediamine, which can be contained in copolyamide in a proportion of at least 50 mol% in relation to 100 mol% diamine.<br>
The diamines with aromatic cores or the aromatic dicarboxylic acids in the inventive copolyamides can be replaced up to 5 mol% with branched or unbranched aliphatic diamines with 2 to 12 CH2 units or aliphatic dicarboxylic acids with 2 to 12 CH2 units.<br>
Suitable cycloaliphatic diamines or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids contain skeletons such as norbomyi, cyclohexyl, or dicyclohexyl methane, dicyclohexylpropane, di(methylcyclohexyl)methane, or di(methylcyclohexyl)propane. Said cycloaliphatic diamines or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids can contain up to mol% of the cited cycloaliphatic diamines or cycloaliphatic dicarboxylic acids.<br>
Suitable dicarboxylic acids with aromatic cores are: isophthalic acid (IPS), terephthalic acid (TPS), naphthalene dicarboxylic acid with different symmetrical and asymmetrical isomers, blends thereof which are incorporated as acids or esters thereof, and combinations of these.<br><br>
In order to accelerate the reaction during the polycondensation of the inventive copolyamides, corresponding phosphorous catalysts such as H3P02, H3PO3, R3P04 can be added to the aqueous mixture in amounts between 0.01 and 0.2 wt%.<br>
m order to stabilize the color in the course of the polymerization and later processing, phosphorous stabilizers of the type R3P02, R3PO3, or R3PO4 can be integrated in amounts between 0.01 to 0.2 wt% in the form of the acids with R=H or metal ions or organic linear or cyclic residues in amounts between 0.01 and 0.2 wt%, or suchlike containing sterically hindered phenols.<br>
m order to control the chain length, either monofunctional amines or mono functional acids are polymerized in, or an excess of diamine or dicarboxylic acid is used. The acids used as monofunctional acids are specifically from the benzoic, acetic, and propionic groups. Hexyl and/or cyclohexyl amine are used as amines. Controller types with stabilizer functions, such as multi-substituted piperidyl groups and tertiary butylphenyl groups are particularly preferred.<br>
The inventive copolyamides exhibit a relative viscosity in the range of 1.33 to 1.65, measured in 0.5% m-cresol.<br>
The inventive polyamide compositions — that is to say, molding materials — can additionally contain conventional additives that are known to the person skilled in the art. In particular, the inventive molding materials contain additives such as UV absorbers which filter out UV light under 400 nm, dyes for tinting the lenses, or thermotropic or thermochromatic additives which change the tint depending on temperature or depending on the wavelength of incident light, or isorefractive grafted core-cladding polymers for enhancing impact strength, or lubricants, or additional processing aids or isorefractive strengtheners like glass fibers or spheres or anti-bloom agents.<br>
The inventive molding materials are produced in an autoclave by a known condensation method whose unique feature is that no processing step exceeds a boiler pressure of 10 bars, or preferably 4 bars. At higher pressures, these diamines with aromatic cores tend to develop branchings which drastically increase melt viscosity, for instance at 260° C, and thus make discharge from the reactors impossible.<br><br>
The cited compounding methods in the extruder represent suitable methods for incorporating desired additives such as UV absorbers which filter out UV light under 400 nm, dyes for tinting the lenses, thermotropic or thermochromatic additives which alter the tint depending on temperature or depending on the wavelength of the incident light, or isorefractive grafted core-cladding polymers for impact strength.<br>
Any known method for thermoplastics, particularly injection molding in multi-cavity tools, is suitable for remolding the granulate that is produced from the molding materials into optical lenses, i.e. lens blanks.<br>
The inventive molding materials also make possible the production of composite, lenses from back-injected films or other molded parts which have polarization characteristics or which are equipped with UV absorbers, for instance absorbers that filter UV light under 400 nm, dyes for tinting the lenses, or thermotropic or thermochromatic additives which alter the tint depending on the temperature or the wavelength of incident light. Furthermore, the chemical resistance or the mechanical stress resistance and the anti-friction or abrasion behavior can also be influenced by composite lenses that are produced by the back-injection of protective films with the lens material.<br>
Suitable applications of the inventive high-refraction molding materials encompass lenses for eyeglasses, cameras, binoculars, microscopes, electro-optical measuring and testing devices, optical filters, headlight lenses, lamp lenses, projectors, video projectors, viewing windows and gage glasses.<br>
For refining surfaces of the molded body that is produced, the known methods can be used, such as varnishing with hardcoat, softcoat, or UV protection varnish, evaporation coating with carbon or metal atoms, plasma treatment and layer polymerization.<br>
These inventive molding materials can of course be used as blend components in other amorphous or semi-crystalline polyamides and furnished with the ordinary strengtheners, nanoparticles, impact strength modifiers, dyes, flame retardants, softeners, stabilizers, and lubricants.<br><br>
