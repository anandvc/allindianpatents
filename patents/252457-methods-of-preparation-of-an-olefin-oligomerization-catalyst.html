DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As used herein, a catalyst component includes a chromium-containing compound, a pyrrole-containing compound, a metal alkyl, a halide-containing compound, a solvent, or combinations thereof. In the various embodiments disclosed herein, contacting of catalyst components may occur in one or more contact zones. A contact zone is a zone in which the components are commingled and/or combined, and thereby contacted The contact zone may be disposed in a vessel, e.g. a storage tank, tote, container, mixing vessel, reactor, etc.; a<br><br>
length of pipe, e.g. a tee, inlet, injection port, or header for combining component feed lines into a common line; or any other suitable apparatus for bringing the components into contact. As used herein, the terms contacted and combined refer to any addition sequence, order, or concentration for contacting or combining two or more catalyst components. The term added to refers to a first catalyst component added, e.g., poured, into a second catalyst component. Where a first catalyst component is added to a second catalyst component, the initial concentration, or molar ratio, of the first catalyst component compared to the second catalyst component typically is relatively small and increases over the duration of the addition. In some embodiments, contacting of components may occur in one or more upstream contact zone(s) prior to further contacting with other catalyst component(s) in one or more downstream contact zone(s). Where a plurality of contact zones are employed, contacting may occur simultaneously across the contact zones, sequentially across the contact zones, or both, as is suitable for a given embodiment. Contacting may be carried out in a batch or continuous process, as is suitable for a given embodiment<br>
In embodiments utilizing a vessel for contacting the components, the components<br>
may be optionally mixed by a mixer disposed in the vessel and the formed mixture may then<br>
be removed for subsequent processing. In embodiments utilizing a tee or other means for<br>
combing lines such as a header, an optional in-line mixer may be placed in the commingled<br>
catalyst feed line to ensure that adequate contacting of the combined components takes place,<br>
and the mixture is thus, formed as it passes through the commingled feed line. Where a<br>
method of making a catalyst recites contact or combination of catalyst components, such<br>
may be carried out by contacting or combining all or a portion of such components in various<br>
embodiments.	<br><br>
As used herein, a composition comprising a catalyst component includes the catalyst component alone or in combination with one or more additional compounds, solvents, or both. None, some, or all of the contacting steps may be carried out in the presence of a solvent (sometimes referred to as an optional solvent), which may be introduced to a contact zone via inclusion with one or more compositions comprising a catalyst component or may be introduced separately to a contact zone, for example in a solvent line or as an initial charge to a contact zone.<br>
Disclosed herein is a method of making a catalyst comprising a chromium-containing compound, a pyrrole-containing compound, a metal alkyl, a halide-containing compound, and optionally a solvent for use in oligomerizing an olefin, wherein a composition comprising the chromium-containing compound is contacted in a contact zone with a composition comprising the metal alkyl. In Fig. 1, four embodiments for contacting the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound with the composition comprising the metal alkyl in a contact zone are illustrated. Figures 1A through ID are included as illustrative representations of embodiments of the present disclosure and do not limit the disclosure.<br>
In an embodiment as illustrated in Fig. 1A, the composition comprising the metal alkyl may be disposed in contact zone 115 and the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound may be contacted with or added to the composition comprising the metal alkyl present in contact zone 115 via line 110. The final catalyst composition may be recovered as a product via line 170. The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 110 may further comprise the pyrrole-containing compound, a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof. The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound may also comprise an amount of non-halide<br><br>
metal alkyl to abate undesired water, acidic protons, or both, as disclosed in more detail herein. The final catalyst composition may be further dilute with a solvent (which may not be identical to the catalyst preparation solvent) prior to use in the oligomerization reaction.<br>
The composition comprising the metal alkyl present in contact zone 115, may comprise the pyrrole-containing compound, the halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof The halide-containing compound may be a metal halide, non-metal halide, or combinations thereof. The composition comprising the metal alkyl may also comprise a metal alkyl halide, a non-halide metal alkyl, a non-metal halide, a metal halide, or combinations thereof The metal alkyl halide in this and other embodiments may comprise diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) and the non-halide metal alkyl may comprise triethyl aluminum (TEA). In an embodiment the metal alkyl may be the halide-containing compound, e.g. DEAC is the halide-containing compound and the metal alkyl.<br>
In an embodiment as illustrated in Fig. IB, a pyrrole-chromium mixture may be formed in contact zone 225 by contacting a composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound fed to contact zone 225 via line 220 and the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound fed to contact zone 225 via line 210, which may occur about instantaneously or over a first period of time of from about 1 minute to about 12 hours, alternatively from about 1 minute to about 6 hours, alternatively from about 1 minute to about 3 hours, alternatively from about 1 hour to about 2 hours. Introduction of the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound and the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound to contact zone 225 may be sequential (e.g. chromium followed by pyrrole or vice-versa) or simultaneous. Once the pyrrole-chromium mixture has been contacted in contact zone 225 the pyrrole-chromium mixture from contact zone 225 may be contacted with or added to the composition comprising the metal alkyl<br><br>
present in contact zone 215 via line 240, which may occur about instantaneously or over a second period of time of from about 1 minute to about 12 hours, alternatively from about 1 minute to about 6 hours, alternatively from about 1 minute to about 3 hours, to form the final catalyst product in contact zone 215. The final catalyst product may be withdrawn from contact zone 215 via line 270. The final catalyst composition may be further dilute with a solvent (which may not be identical to the catalyst preparation solvent) prior to use in the oligomerization reaction.<br>
The composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 220 and the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 210 may be contacted, e.g., over the first period of time, at an about constant pyrrole to chromium (Py:Cr) molar ratio or alternatively at a variable Py:Cr molar ratio to form the pyrrole-chromium mixture in contact zone 225. The pyrrole-chromium mixture in contact zone 225 may then be contacted with or added to, e.g., over the second period of time, the metal alkyl present in contact zone 215 via line 240, or alternatively already present in contact zone 215, at an about constant Py:Cr molar ratio, for example in the range of from about 1.0:1 to about 4.0:1. Alternatively, the pyrrole-chromium mixture in contact zone 225 may then be contacted with or added to, e.g., over the second period of time, the metal alkyl present in contact zone 215 via line 240 at a variable Py:Cr molar ratio. In an embodiment the variable Py:Cr molar ratio is decreasing over the second period of time where a decreasing Py:Cr molar ratio refers to a general decreasing trend in the molar Tatio from the start of the addition sequence to the finish and occasional increases in the ratio within the overall decreasing trend are acceptable. In an embodiment a decreasing trend of the Py:Cr refers to the specific situation where the ending Py:Cr ratio is less than the beginning Py:Cr ratio. In an embodiment, an initial Py:Cr molaT ratio at the start of the addition may be greater than the final Py:Cr molar ratio of the<br><br>
catalyst; and an ending Py:Cr molar ratio at the end of the addition may be less than the final Py;Cr molar ratio of the catalyst. In an embodiment, the final Py:Cr molar ratio of the catalyst may be in a range of from about 1.0:1 to about 4.0:1; the initial Py:Cr molar ratio may be greater than about 6:1, alternatively greater than about 20:1, alternatively greater than about 40:1, alternatively greater than about 60:1; and the ending Py:Cr molar ratio may be greater than or equal to about 0, alternatively greater than or equal to about 0.1:1, alternatively greater than or equal to about 0.3:1, and alternatively greater than or equal to about 0.6:1. In an embodiment, the initial Py:Cr molar ratio is about twice the final Py:Cr molar ratio of the catalyst during a first about one-half of the addition and the ending Py:Cr molar ratio is about 0 during a second about one-half of the addition, wherein the final Py.Cr molar ratio of the catalyst is in a range of from about 1.0:1 to about 4.0:1. Introduction of a pyrrole-containing compound and a chromium-containing compound in a contact zone (e.g., formation of a PyCr mixture) as disclosed in various embodiments may be carried out as disclosed in this paragraph, including but not limited to the embodiments shown in Figs. ID, 2C,2D,3B,and4A-E.<br>
The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 210 may comprise a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof. The composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 220 may comprise a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 210, the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 220, or both may also comprise an amount of non-halide metal alkyl to abate undesired water, acidic protons, or both as disclosed herein. Alternatively, the non-halide metal alkyl may be contacted with or added to the pyrrole-chromium mixture, for example in line 240 via line 230, in contact zone 225<br><br>
(not shown), or both, to abate undesired water, acidic protons, or both. The composition comprising the metal alkyl present in contact zone 215, may comprise the halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof The composition comprising the metal alkyl may also comprise a metal alkyl halide, a non-halide metal alkyl, a metal halide, non-metal halide, or combinations thereof<br>
In an embodiment as shown in Fig. 1C, a pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture maybe formed in contact zone 325 by contacting the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound fed to contact zone 325 via line 320 with the composition comprising the metal alkyl fed to contact zone 325 via line 315 which may occur about instantaneously or over a first period of time. Addition of the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound and the composition comprising the metal alkyl to contact zone 325 may be sequential (e.g. pyrrole followed by metal alkyl or vice-versa) or simultaneous. Once the pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture has been contacted in contact zone 325 the pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture from contact zone 325 may be disposed via line 360 in contact zone 335. The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound may then be contacted with or added to contact zone 335 via line 310, which may occur about instantaneously or over a second period of time. The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound is thus contacted with or added to the pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture present in contact zone 335, lo form the final catalyst product in contact zone 335. Addition of the composition comprising the pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture and the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound to contact zone 335 may be sequential (e.g. pyrrole-metal alkyl followed by the chromium containing compound or vice-versa) or simultaneous. The final catalyst product may be withdrawn from contact zone 335 via line 370. The final catalyst<br><br>
composition may be further diluted with a solvent (which may not be identical to the catalyst preparation solvent) prior to use in the oligomerization reaction.<br>
Although the embodiment shown in Fig. 1C shows two contact zones being used to perform the addition sequences, the addition sequences could alternatively be performed in a single contact zone, for example, in contact zone 325. In this embodiment, the composition comprising the metal alkyl may first be placed in the contact zone. In a second step the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound may be contacted with or added to the composition comprising the metal alkyl present in the contact zone (or visa-versa) to adequately contact and form the pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture. In a third step, the composition containing the chromium-containing compound may be contacted with or added to the pyrrole-metal alkyl mixture to form the final catalyst product.<br>
The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 310 may comprise a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof The composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 320 may comprise a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 310, the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 320, or both may comprise an amount of non-halide metal alkyl to abate undesired water, acidic protons, or both. The composition comprising the metal alkyl in line 315, may comprise the halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof The composition comprising the metal alkyl may also comprise a metal alkyl halide, a non-halide metal alkyl, a metal halide, non-metal halide, or combinations thereof<br>
In an embodiment as shown in Fig. ID, a composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 420 and a composition comprising the chromium-containing<br><br>
compound in line 410 may be simultaneously contacted with or added to, which may occur about instantaneously or over a period of time, with a composition comprising the metal alkyl present in contact zone 415, and a final catalyst product may be withdrawn from contact zone 415 via line 470. The final catalyst composition may be further diluted with a solvent (which may not be identical to the catalyst preparation solvent) prior to use in the oligomerization reaction. The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound and the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound maybe contacted with or added to the composition comprising the metal alkyl at Py:Cr molar ratios described previously.<br>
The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 410 may comprise a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof. The composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 420 may comprise a non-metal halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof In the embodiment shown in Fig. ID, the composition comprising the metal alkyl in contact zone 415, may comprise the halide-containing compound, the solvent, or combinations thereof, each added to contact zone 415 through various input lines not shown in Fig. ID. The composition comprising the metal alkyl may also comprise a metal alkyl halide, a non-halide metal alkyl, a metal halide, non-metal halide, or combinations thereof The composition comprising the chromium-containing compound in line 410, the composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound in line 420, or both may comprise an amount of non-halide metal alkyl to abate undesired water, acidic protons, or both.<br>
Further disclosed herein is a method of making a catalyst comprising abating all or a portion of water, acidic protons, or both from a composition comprising the chromium-containing compound, a composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound, a<br><br>
composition comprising the non-metal halide-containing compound, a composition comprising the solvent, or combinations thereof prior to contact thereof with a composition comprising the metal halide-containing compound. Abating water, acidic protons, or both may include neutralizing acidic protons; physically removing water; physically removing acidic protons; chemically binding or reacting free water such that the water is no Longer free; or combinations thereof The amount of water, acid protons, or both removed from the catalyst component may be determined using known methods, for example infrared analysis to determine water content.<br>
In embodiments to prepare a catalyst, one or more of the catalyst components may contain water, for example the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound. Water may be present in a catalyst compound, for example as a contaminant or as a co-product produced during the preparation of the catalyst compound. For example, water may be co-produced during preparation of the chromium-containing compound, and such water may complex with the chromium Acidic protons may also be present, for example carboxylic acid (e.g., ethylhexanoic acid) remaining from production of the chromium-containing compound (e.g., chromium tris(2-ethylhexanoate)). This free water as well as acid present in the chromium source can subsequently react with a metal halide present in the catalyst, for example the metal alkyl halide such as DEAC, to form corrosive compounds, e.g. hydrogen halide compound (e.g hydrochloric acid). Such compounds may cause corrosion in downstream equipment over time, in particular when heated, for example in downstream fractionation facilities. Accordingly, it may be desirable to abate water, acidic protons, or both, when making the catalyst to prevent downstream formation of potentially corrosive by-products.<br><br>
Furthermore, in embodiments of a method of preparing a catalyst, impurities in the catalyst components can participate in unwanted side reactions leading to the formation of precipitates. These precipitates may to lead to further unwanted reactions, for example polymer formation in the trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. Water may be an initiator of the precipitation reactions and therefore may be desirably abated from the catalyst components to improve selectivity to 1-hexene. Abating water, acidic protons, or both may also have beneficial impact on catalyst efficiency, even where corrosive compounds are produced For example, in an embodiment, water is abated from one or more catalyst components by contact thereof with a corrosive abatement compound such as a halide-containing compound, which reacts with and abates the water. Reactions of water with a corrosive abatement compound such as a halide-containing compound may produce a corrosive compound, e.g., HC1, and such should be taken into account in the overall design of the system. Examples of suitable halide-containing compounds for reaction with water include a metal halide, a metal alky] halide, a non-halide metal alkyl and a metal halide, a non-metal halide, or combinations thereof. The use of a halide-containing compound to abate water may be used in place of or in addition to other water abatement embodiments disclosed herein such as the use of a non-halide metal alkyl to abate water.<br>
In an embodiment, water, acidic protons, or both may be abated by pre-contacting one or more catalyst components with a non-corrosive abatement compound, which is a compound that does not form a corrosive compound such as a hydrogen halide compound upon contact with the water, acidic protons, or both. Non-corrosive abatement compounds include, for example, a non-halide metal alkyl such as TEA. Corrosive abatement compounds are compounds that can form a corrosive compound upon contact with water, acidic protons or both such as (i) a metal alkyl halide, (ii) a metal halide and a metal alkyl,<br><br>
and (iii) a non-metal halide and a metal alkyl. The corrosive abatement compounds also include any other combination of compounds that form a corrosive compound upon contact with water, acidic proton, or both.<br>
In an embodiment, one or more catalyst components such as a composition comprising the chromium-containing compound, a composition comprising the pyrrole-containing compound, a non-metal halide-containing compound, a solvent, or combinations thereof, are contacted with a non-halide metal alkyl to abate water, acidic protons, or both. The non-halide metal alkyl can react with free water, acid protons, or both contained in the catalyst components) when pre-contacted to abate water, acidic protons, or both. The non-halide metal alkyl may be pre-mixed in a contact zone with the one or more catalyst components. The pre-mix may be made by either adding the non-halide metal alkyl to the catalyst component(s) or vice versa, and in an embodiment, the pre-mix may be made by adding the non-halide metal alkyl to the catalyst component(s). These additions can be made in various ratios as described below.<br>
In an embodiment, the non-halide metal alkyl in added to or contacted with a composition comprising the chromium-containing compound. Given that the chromium may react with the non-halide metal alkyl to form a gel, it may be desirable to maintain a low concentration of non-halide metal alkyl by adding it to the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound, so that there may only be an amount available to react with the water and acid Conversely, with a high concentration of non-halide metal alkyl, such as can occur when adding the composition comprising the chromium-containing compound to the non-halide metal alkyl, more non-halide metal alkyl would be available to react with the chromium (and thereby form a gel) after the water and acid were removed.<br><br>
In each embodiment, the water or acid abating substance (e.g., a non-halide metal alkyl) may be contacted with or added to one or more catalyst components in an amount effective to abate substantially all free/available water, acidic protons, or both from some or all of the components contacted with the non-halide metal alkyl. In an embodiment, the amount of non-halide metal alkyl contacted with or added to such components is small relative to the amount of the catalyst components to which it is being contacted with or added to.

An azeotropic solvent, e.g., a composition comprising an aromatic compound such as ethylbenzene, may be added to the composition containing a chromium-containing compound in contact zone 910 via line 902 or directly added to separator 900. The azeotropic solvent may be added in an amount effective to form an azeotropic solution with the chromium-containing compound. In an embodiment, the azeotropic solvent may be added in an amount from about 0.5 to about 1000 times the weight of the composition containing the chromium-containing compound to which it is added, alternatively from about 0.5 to about 500 times the weight, alternatively from about 0.5 to about 100 times the weight, alternatively from about 0.5 to about 50 times the weight, alternatively from about 0.5 to about 25 times the weight, alternatively from about 0.5 to about 15 times the weight. The resultant azeotropic solution in contact zone 910 may then be passed from contact zone 910 via line 911 and fed into a separator 900 for the azeotropic distillation of the solution to remove the water. Operating temperature of separator 900 will depend on the azeotropic solvent used and the pressure maintained on the separator. The water may be removed from separator 900 through overhead line 912, optionally the aromatic compound recovered, and<br><br>
the remaining abated components may be fed via line 913 into contact zone 915 for contacting with the remaining catalyst components including the composition comprising the metal alkyl, the pyrrole-containing compound, the halide-containing compound (e.g., a metal halide or non-metal halide), the catalyst solvent, any remaining non-halide metal alkyl, metal alkyl halide, or combinations thereof, which may be placed into contact zone 915 via various input lines not shown in Fig. 3A.

Alternatively the water abated material comprising the chromium-containing compound may be stored prioT to contact with the remaining catalyst components. Optionally, the abated components from line 913 may be subjected to further water abatement as described herein, for example contact with a non-halide metal alkyl, adsorbent, or both prior to contact with the remaining catalyst components.<br>

The contacting may occur prior to contacting with (i) a metal alkyl halide, (ii) a metal halide and a metal alkyl, or (iii) a non-metal halide and a metal alkyl. In some embodiments, contacting the chromium-containing compound with the pyrrole-containing compound may enhance the solubility of the chromium-containing compound in a solvent (e.g. ethylbenzene) as well as reduce the solution viscosity. Thus, the reduced viscosity and more soluble solution may enhance the suitability of the solution to water abatement by means of passing it through an adsorbent such as molecular sieves, to remove all or a portion of any water present  In an<br><br>
embodiment, the pyrrole added may constitute substantially all or only a portion of the pyrrole required to make the catalyst composition. Other known means for reducing viscosity, enhancing solubility, or both may be employed such that a catalyst component becomes suitable for contact with an adsorbent to remove water.<br>
Adsorption as used herein refers to the separation operation in which one component of a gas or liquid mixture is selectively retained in the pores of a resinous or microcrystalline solid A gas or liquid mixture contacts a solid (the adsorbent) and a mixture component (the adsorbate, which is typically water) adheres to the surface of the solid In an embodiment, an adsorbent maybe used to abate water by adding the adsorbent to catalyst components) in a vessel and mixing thoroughly for adequate contacting of the adsorbent with the catalyst component(s). The mixture may then be allowed to stand and after a period of time, the adsorbent settles to the bottom of the vessel. Separation can be completed by decanting or filtration (e.g., suction filtration). Alternatively, water may be abated by passing the catalyst component(s) through a fixed adsorption bed comprised of an adsorbent, allowing the mixture adequate contact time for the adsorbate to sufficiently adhere to the adsorbent, and then removing the abated catalyst components) from the adsorption bed. The adsorbent may then be replaced or regenerated for the next use. The original adsorption capacity of the saturated bed may be recovered by any suitable regeneration method, for example, thermal regeneration, regeneration by pressure swing, or regeneration by purging.<br>
In the embodiments, any suitable adsorbent may be used. Examples of suitable adsorbents include 3-Angstrom molecular sieves, 5-Angstrom molecular sieves, 13X molecular sieves, alumina, silica, or combinations thereof 3-Angstrom (3A) and 5-Angstrom (5A) refers to the size of the molecule the material can adsorb, for example, the 3A molecular sieve can adsorb molecules less than 3 angstrom and the 5A molecular sieve<br><br>
can adsorb molecules less than 5 angstrom. Molecular sieves are crystalline structures not unlike sponges on a molecular scale. They have a solid framework defining large internal cavities where molecules can be adsorbed These cavities are interconnected by pore openings through which molecules can pass. Because of their crystalline nature, the pores and cavities are the same size, and depending on the size of the openings, they can adsorb molecules readily, slowly, or not at all, thus functioning as molecular sieves - adsorbing molecules of certain sizes while rejecting larger ones.<br>

Contact zone 1000 may be a fixed adsorption bed as described in a previous embodiment, sized accordingly to the volumes of materials being adsorbed The pyrrole-chromium mixture may be passed through the adsorption bed comprised of an adsorbent, e.g. 3 A molecular sieve, allowing for<br><br>
the adsorption process to occur over a second period of time to adsorb essentially all of the free water from the pyrrole-chromium mixture. Contact with the adsorbent in contact zone 1000 may be carried out according to various known methods.<br>
The water abated mixture in contact zone 1000 may then be passed from contact zone 1000 via line 1018 and contacted with the remaining catalyst components in contact zone 1015 including the composition comprising the metal alkyl, a halide-containing compound (e.g., a metal halide or non-metal halide), the solvent, any remaining non-halide metal alkyl, metal alkyl halide, or combinations thereof, which may be placed into contact zone 1015 via various input lines not shown in Fig. 3B. A catalyst product may then be withdrawn from contact zone 1015 via line 1070 and optionally filtered (not shown). Alternatively the water abated material comprising the chromium-containing compound may be stored prior to contact with the remaining catalyst components. Optionally, the water abated compounds from contact zone 1000 may be subjected to further water abatement as described herein, for example contact with a non-halide metal alkyl, azeotropic distillation, or both prior to contact with the remaining catalyst components.<br>

Examples Preparation of an oligomerization catalyst having been generally described, the following examples are given as particular embodiments of the catalyst disclosed and to demonstrate the practice and advantages thereof It is understood that the examples are given<br><br>
by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the specification or the claims to follow in any manner.<br>
Various embodiments for preparing the oligomerization catalyst are shown in examples 1 through 14. In example 1, selective 1-hexene catalyst is prepared at various temperatures and chromium concentrations. In example 2, selective I-hexene catalyst is prepared by simultaneous addition of chromium/ethylbenzene and TEA/DEAC/pyrrole/ethylbenzene to the heel of previously prepared catalyst. In example 3, selective 1-hexene catalyst is prepared by using a pyrrolexhromium ratio of 6:1 for the first half of the chromium/pyrrole addition and a pyrrolexhromium ratio of 0 during the second half of the chromium/pyrrole addition. In example 4, selective 1-hexene catalyst is prepared by simultaneous addition of all catalyst components. In example 5, chromium compounds containing various amounts of water and chromium oligomers are used in the preparation of the selective 1-hexene catalyst. In example 6, selective 1-hexene catalyst is prepared by separate but simultaneous addition of the pyrrole and chromium components to a solution of TEA and DEAC. In example 7, selective 1-hexene catalyst is improved when a small amount of TEA is added to the chromium component and water, acidic protons, or both are abated. In example 8, water, acidic protons, or both are abated in the preparation of the selective 1-hexene catalyst by contacting a small amount of TEA with the chromium/pyrrole solution. In example 9, preparation of the selective 1-hexene catalyst is made by varying the pyrrolexhromium ratio during the addition to TEA/DEAC.<br>
In example 10, preparation of the selective 1-hexene catalyst is made using high initial pyrrolexhromium contact ratios when contacted with TEA/DEAC. In example 11, preparation of the selective 1-hexene catalyst is made using simultaneous separate addition of catalyst components to the heel of previously prepared catalyst.    In example 12,<br><br>
preparation of the selective 1-hexene catalyst is made with the addition of a nitrogen<br>
compound to the alkylaluminum compound to solubilize products resulting from the reaction<br>
of water and aluminum alkyls. In example 13, water is abated when the pyrrole and<br>
chromium components are contacted to reduce the chromium component's viscosity,<br>
facilitating water removal using molecular sieves. In example 14, water is abated by<br>
azeotropic distillation to remove the water from the chromium catalyst component In<br>
example 15, the impact of the catalyst age on 1-hexene purity is described. Several of the<br>
above examples also include the embodiment for the addition of chromium and/or pyrrole to<br>
the alkyl aluminums.<br>
1	In the examples below, catalyst was prepared using one of two apparatus set-ups.<br>
One set-up is a lab scale set-up for preparing catalyst in small quantities, for example 100 ml, which are typically used foT screening purposes. The other set-up is a pilot plant scale setup typically designed for preparing larger quantities of catalyst, for example 3.5 gallons, which would be suitable for use in a pilot plant.<br>
The lab scale set-up prepares catalyst in a dry box in which the atmosphere inside the<br>
box is controlled with a helium blanket keeping it free of oxygen and moisture, which may<br>
be detrimental to the catalyst components, the prepared catalysts, or both. All lab scale<br>
catalyst preparation procedures described in the examples below are performed in glassware<br>
in a dry box. Once the catalyst is prepared it is diluted with cyclohexane to the concentration<br>
desired foT oligomerization reactor tests. The diluted catalyst solution is then transferred into<br>
a 300 cc metal cylinder to provide the means for transport of the catalyst to an<br>
,	oligomerization reactor under protected atmosphere.  Note that any transfer of components<br>
via syringes described in the examples below is done in the dry box.<br><br>
The pilot plant scale set-up prepares catalyst under a nitrogen blanket to control the atmosphere, keeping it free of oxygen and moisture. All pilot plant scale catalyst preparation<br>
procedures described in the examples below are performed in a 5 gallon reactor comprising a<br>
*<br>
hasteloy steel autoclave. Once the catalyst is prepared it is filtered into a 5-10 gallon metal &gt; cylinder. About 150 grams of the prepared catalyst is then transferred from the large cylinder into a smaller, 300 cc, metal cylinder and transported to a helium blanketed dry box as described above. The prepared catalyst is transferred into glassware and is diluted with cyclohexane to the desired concentration for testing in the oligomerization reactor. The diluted catalyst solution is then transferred into a 300 cc metal cylinder and transported to an oligomerization reactor.<br>
In the examples below, the prepared catalyst is tested in either a batch or a continuous oligomerization reactor. The batch oligomerization reactor is a 1 liter autoclave that is sealed and is under a nitrogen blanket. It has a magnetic stirring device to stir the contents of the sealed container. Prepared catalyst solution transported to the oligomerization reactor in the 75 cc metal cylinder. Solvent, e.g., cyclohexane, is charged to the oligomerization reactor, and the catalyst is transferred to the reactor by connecting the cylinder to the reactor and pressurizing the cylinder with ethylene, which conveys the catalyst into the reactor. The oligomerization reactor is pressurized with 650 psig of ethylene and 50 psig of hydrogen, and is operated at a temperature of about 115 °C.<br>
In some of the examples below, a continuous oligomerization reactor is used to test the prepared catalyst. The continuous oligomerization is preformed by controlling of all the feeds to the reactor by using separate controls for each feed component. Hydrogen is fed to the reactor at a rate of about 0.5 L/hr, and ethylene is fed to the reactor at a rate of about 497 g/hr.   The reactor is either a 1 liter or a 1 gallon autoclave, depending on the desired<br><br>
residence time in the reactor.   Reaction temperature is about 115 °C, and pressure is about 800 psig.<br>
Online samples of production from the continuous oligomerization reactor were collected via liquid sampling valves (manufactured by Valco) and fed to an online gas chromatograph (GC), a Hewlett Packard 6890, for analysis. The productions samples were analyzed by the GC for the amount of ethylene present, hexene present, and Ce isomers and higher oligomers present. From this information the selectivity, purity, and conversion was calculated Selectivity (1-C6=) refers to the weight percent of ethylene converted into 1-hexene. Purity (1-Ce=/ Cg) refers to the weight percent of 1-hexene in the total of all C6 isomers. Conversion (C2-) refers to the weight percent of ethylene has been converted to oligomer product (e.g., hexene or decenes, etc.). Productivity refers how much 1-hexene the catalyst produced, and relates to the amount of catalyst is used Productivity is quantified in units of grams of 1-hexene per gram of chromium (g l-C6=/g Cr). In the batch processes, productivity is evaluated over a 30 minute time frame. Other evaluations made on the oligomerization processed catalyst examples include reactor polymer (Rx Polymer) and total polymer. At the end of each day, the reactor was opened and cleaned. Any formed polymer inside the reactor was collected, allowed to dry, and then weighed. This amount was then scaled up to a commercial sized processing unit of 100,000,000 pounds/year and reported as reactor polymer, quantified in pounds per hour expected in a 100,000,000 pound per year plant (Lb/Hr lOOMM/yr Plant). A filter comprising a stainless steel pad placed downstream of the reactor was also removed, dried and weighed at the end of each day for amounts of polymer. This amount of polymer was then scaled up to a 100,000,000 pounds/year plant and added to the reactor polymer amount for reporting the total polymer, quantified in pounds per hour expected in a 100,000,000 pound per year plant (Lb/Hr 1 OOMM/yr Plant).<br><br>
To determine the presence of water of hydration in some of the samples an infrared analysis was done using a standard IR apparatus. The IR band for the complexed water, e.g., aboul 1450 cm'1, of hydration is near the band for chromium oligomers, making it difficult to distinguish the two. Therefore, in some cases a methanol solution test for precipitation of chromium oligomers was performed to help in evaluating the online samples to determine the presence of water of hydration.<br>
Example 1<br>
Catalyst 1-8: Catalyst was prepared by adding 14.1 lbs of dry, nitrogen-purged toluene to a 5 gallon reactor. To the toluene was added 630.9 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate dissolved in 750 mL toluene followed by a 300 mL toluene rinse. 2,5-Dimethylpyrrole (388.9 mL) was added to the chromium solution in the reactor. The reactor was purged with nitrogen and brought to a temperature of 25°C.

The needles of the syringes were added to the 100 mL volumetric flask and the syringes emptied into the flask simultaneously at the same rate over 30 minutes. After the additions were complete, ethylbenzene was added to the flask to obtain a total volume of 100 mL. The catalyst (1 mL) prepared by this method was tested in a 1 Lbatch reactor at 116°C and 680 psig.   The results of this test are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
Example 5 Catalyst 13-15: Catalyst was prepared by adding 15.85 g ethylbenzene to a dry 100 mL volumetric flask. To this flask was added 12.09 g neat triethylaluminum (TEA), 9.26 g neat diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) and 2.74 g 2,5-dimethylpyrrole. To this mixture was added 4.76 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate dissolved in 2.38 g ethylbenzene. The volume was brought to 100 mL with ethylbenzene. Different preparations of chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate were used to prepare the catalysts 13-15. In catalyst 13 the chromium content of the chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate was 10.5%. Infrared analysis and a methanol solubility test indicated that some water of hydration was present but no chromium oligomers. In catalyst 14 the chromium content was 10.9% and infrared analysis and methanol solubility indicated that neither water of hydration nor chromium oligomers were present.   In catalyst 15 the analysis indicated the presence of chromium oligomers.   The<br><br>
catalysts prepared were tested for activity in the continuous reactor (1 L) and the average results for two test runs of each preparation are shown in Table 5.<br><br>
The examples show that the best combination of purity and productivity are obtained when the water of hydration and chromium oligomers are not contained in the chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate in significant amounts.<br>
Example 6<br>
Catalyst 16: Ethylbenzene (20.01 g) was added to a dry 125 mL Erlenmeyer flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer.

Into a 10 rnL syringe was added 4.61 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate dissolved in 2.28 g ethylbenzene. Into a separate 10 mL syringe was added 2.73 g 2,5-dimethylpyrrole and 3.38 g ethylbenzene. Both of the syringes had an approximate volume of 7.5 mL. The syringe needles were put into opposite sides of the Erlenmeyer flask containing the diluted aluminum alkyls and the contents were added simultaneously over 30 minutes. After the addition was complete, the contents were transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask and diluted to about 103 mL with ethylbenzene.

This is an amount of TEA sufficient to read with water and excess acid present in the chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate. The chromium solution, after reaction with TEA, was added, over 50 minutes, to a solution containing TEA (11.81 g), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC, 9.27 g), 2,5-dunethylpyrrole (2.75 g) and ethylbenzene (25.01 g). Ethylbenzene was subsequently added to provide a total volume of 100 mL.<br>
Catalyst 18: A comparison catalyst was prepared by adding 30.02 g of ethylbenzene to 4.62 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate dissolved in 2.27 g ethylbenzene.

Ethylbenzene was subsequently added to provide a total volume of 100 mL.<br>
These catalysts were tested for productivity in a 1 L continuous reactor. The average of two separate runs for each catalyst is shown in Table 7.<br><br><br>
The addition of TEA to a chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate solution provided a catalyst with increased activity. It will also reduce corrosion in equipment after the catalyst has been inactivated The example further provides an example of TEA addition to chromium to abate water, acidic protons, or both.<br>
Example 8<br>
Catalyst 19: Neat triethylalummum (TEA, 0.43 g) was added to 2.01 g of<br>
ethylbenzene. This solution was added slowly to 4.62 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate in<br>
27.27 g ethylbenzene. This is a small excess of the amount of TEA sufficient to react with<br>
water and excess acid present in the chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate. To this<br>
chromium/TEA    solution    was    added    2.73    g    of   2,5-dimethylpyrrole.	The<br>
chromium/TEA/dimethylpyrrole solution, was added, over 30-40 minutes, to a solution containing TEA (11.62 g), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC, 9.25 g) and ethylbenzene (15.00 g).  Ethylbenzene was then added to provide a total volume of 100 mL.<br>
Catalyst 20: A comparison catalyst was prepared by adding 2.74 g 2,5-dimethylpyrrole to 4.61 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate dissolved in 2.27 g ethylbenzene. An immediate reduction in the viscosity of the chromium solution was observed. This chromium solution was added, over 30-40 minutes, to a solution containing TEA (12.08 g), diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC, 9.27 g) and ethylbenzene (20.00 g). Ethylbenzene was then added to provide a total volume of 100 mL.<br>
These catalyst preparations were tested for productivity in a 1 L continuous reactor. The average of three separate test runs for each catalyst is shown in Table 8.<br><br><br>
The addition of TEA provided a catalyst with increased activity. It can also reduce corrosion in downstream equipment after the catalyst is inactivated<br>

Example 10<br>
Catalyst 24: To a dry, nitrogen purged 5 gallon reactor was added 14.6 lbs of dry, nitrogen purged ethylbenzene. The reactor was purged with nitrogen and a mixture consisting of 1,592 g neat triethylaluminum (TEA) and 1,238 g neat diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) was added to the reactor. The aluminum alkyl mix vessel was rinsed with 0.2 lbs of ethylbenzene and this rinse was added to the reactor. A chromium solution was prepared by adding 700 mL of ethylbenzene to 630.9 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate. The mixture was stirred until solution was obtained and was transferred to a 1 gallon cylinder followed by a 75 mL ethylbenzene rinse. The cylinder, containing the chromium solution, was pressured and depressured several times with nitrogen. Chromium/2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP) mixtures were added to the reactor in four batches from a chromium/DMP mix tank. For the first batch 65 g of chromium and 233 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 31-52 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 22°C. For the second batch 130 g of chromium and 97 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 48-58 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 22°C. For the third batch 326 g of chromium and 39 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 48-54 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 22°C. For the fourth batch 789 g of chromium and 20 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 100-130 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 24°C. Ethylbenzene (1 lb) was added to the chromium solution cylinder and used to rinse the chromium/DMP mix tank.   The ethylbenzene rinse was then added to the reactor.   The<br><br>
reactor was stirred for an additional 30 minutes. After standing overnight the catalyst solution was filtered, using a filter as described above. The catalyst solution was tested for activity in a 1 L continuous reactor. The results are shown as Catalyst 24 in Table 9 below. The results shown are the average of two separate test runs.<br>
Example 11 Catalyst 25: To a dry, nitrogen purged 5 gallon reactor was added 14.0 lbs of dry, nitrogen purged ethylbenzene. The reactor was purged with nitrogen and a mixture consisting of 1,283 g neat triethylaluminum (TEA) and 990 g neat diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) was added to the reactor. The aluminum alkyl mix vessel was rinsed with 0.2 lbs of ethylbenzene and this rinse was added to the reactor. A chromium solution was prepared by adding 700 mL of ethylbenzene to 630.9 g chromium (III) 2-ethyIhexanoate. The mixture was stirred until solution was obtained and was transferred to a 1 gallon cylinder followed by a 75 mL ethylbenzene rinse. The cylinder, containing the chromium solution, was pressured and depressured several times with nitrogen. Chromium/2,5-dimethylpyrrole (DMP) mixtures were added to the reactor in four batches from a chromium/DMP mix tank. For the first batch 52 g of chromium and 187 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 20-52 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 21°C. For the second batch 104 g of chromium and 78 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 40-50 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 22°C. For the third batch 261 g of chromium and 31 mL DMP were added to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 90-101 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 23°C.   For the fourth batch 625 g of chromium and 16 mL DMP were added<br><br>
to the mix tank and then this mixture was added to the reactor in 30-108 g increments with stirring and cooling so the temperature did not exceed 23°C.<br>
To the TEA/DEAC mix vessel was added 327 g neat TEA and 256 g neat DEAC. To the chromium/DMP mix tank was added 261 g of the chromium solution. To a separate cylinder connected to the reactor was added 78 mL of DMP. The reactor pressure was increased with nitrogen and the valves connecting each of the above cylinders to the reactor were opened. Reducing the reactor pressure transferred the contents of each of these vessels simultaneously to the reactor while the reactor was being stirred and cooled. An increase of 1°C (20°C to21°C) was observed in the reactor temperature upon addition of the catalyst components.<br>
Ethylbenzene (0.4 lb) was added to the chromium solution cylinder and used to rinse the chromium/DMP mix tank. The ethylbenzene rinse was then added to the reactor. Ethylbenzene (0.5 lb) was added to the DMP cylinder. This rinse of the DMP cylinder was added to the reactor. Ethylbenzene (0.2 lb) was added to the aluminum alkyl mix vessel and then pressured into the reactor. The reactor was stirred for an additional 30 minutes. After standing overnight the catalyst solution was filtered, using a filter as described above. The catalyst solution was tested for activity in a 1 L continuous reactor. The results are shown as Catalyst 25 in Table 9. The results shown are the average of three separate test runs.<br><br><br>
Catalysts 21-24 show that varying the chromium to pyrrole ratio in a decreasing manner produces a catalyst which has increased selectivity, product purity, and productivity. Catalyst 25 demonstrates the separate simultaneous addition of catalyst components to a heel of active catalyst.<br>
Example 12<br>
Two catalysts were prepared, catalyst 26 and catalyst 27, with the addition of a nitrogen compound to the alkylaluminum compound to solubilize products resulting from the reaction of water and aluminum alkyls.<br>
Catalyst 26: To a dry 100 mL volumetric flask was added 25.01 g ethylbenzene, 12.07 g neat triethylaluminum (TEA) and 9.27 g neat diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) and 0.34 g tributylamine. To this was added a solution containing 4.61 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate, 2.27 g ethylbenzene and 2.74 g 2,5-dimethylpyrrole. Ethylbenzene was then added to provide a total volume of 100 mL. Upon standing overnight no film was observed in the neck of the flask and no precipitate was observed When the amine was not added to the catalyst preparation a film was observed upon standing overnight. A film was observed in the neck of the flask after standing for an additional 24 hours. This catalyst was tested for activity in a 1 L continuous reactor. The results of two separate test runs are shown in Table 10 below as Catalyst 26.<br>
Catalyst 27: To a dry 100 mL volumetric flask was added 25.01 g ethylbenzene, 12.07 g neat triethylaluminum (TEA) and 9.27 g neat diethylaluminum chloride (DEAC) and 0.34 g tributylamine. To this was added a solution containing 4.61 g chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate, 2.27 g ethylbenzene, 2.74 g 2,5-dimethylpyrrole and 1.06 g tributylamine. Ethylbenzene was then added to provide a total volume of 100 mL. Upon standing overnight no film was observed in the neck of the flask and no precipitate was observed.  When the<br><br>
amine was not added to the catalyst preparation a film was observed upon standing overnight A film was observed in the neck of the flask after standing for an additional 24 hours. This catalyst was tested for activity in a 1 L continuous reactor. The results of two separate test runs are shown in Table 10 as Catalyst 27.<br><br>
The example shows that the addition of an amine to the alkylaluminum compounds inhibits formation of detrimental precipitation from the catalyst solution.<br>
Example 13<br>
Catalyst 28: Chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate (18.44 g) dissolved in 9.1 g ethylbenzene produces a viscous solution. When 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (10.96 g) was added to this viscous solution a much thinner solution results. This thinner solution is much more adaptable to water removal by molecular sieves. Activated 3A molecular sieves (15.05 g) were added to the chromium/pynole/ethylbenzene solution and allowed to stand with periodic shaking for 22 days before catalyst preparation. A solution was prepared in a 100 mL volumetric flask consisting of ethylbenzene (25.00 g), neat triethylaluminum (12.07 g) and neat diethylaluminum chloride (9.26 g). To this aluminum alkyl solution was added 9.62 g of the dried chromium/pynole/ethylbenzene solution and the resulting catalyst was diluted to 100 mL with additional ethylbenzene. After standing overnight a film was observed in the neck of the flask but no precipitate was observed in the flask. This catalyst was tested in a 1 L continuous reactor and an average of two separate test runs is shown in Table 11 as Catalyst 28.  A control using undried chromium/pyrrole/ethylbenzene solution<br><br>
was made at the same time. After standing overnight a film was observed in the neck of the flask and a precipitate was also observed. This catalyst was tested in a 1 L continuous reactor and an average of two separate test runs is shown in Table 11 as Catalyst 29.<br><br>
In addition to the improved catalyst productivity as shown, reduced downstream corrosion could be obtained using the dried catalyst components.<br>
Example 14<br>
Catalyst 30-31: Chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate (222.10 g) was added to a round bottom flask equipped with a Dean-Stark tube. Ethylbenzene (147.39 g) was added and the flask was heated to reflux the contents. Reflux was continued until water no longer accumulated in the Dean-Stark tube. Ethylbenzene and water (27.13 g) were discarded from the Dean-Stark tube. This chromium solution was used to make catalyst by adding it to a 100 mL volumetric flask containing ethylbenzene (16.73 g), neat triethylaluminum (12.28 g)3 neat diethylaluminum chloride (9.26 g) and 2,5-dimethylpyrrole (2.74 g). Ethylbenzene was subsequently added to dilute the catalyst to a 100 mL volume. This catalyst was tested in a 1 L continuous reactor. The results of the test (two catalyst preparations and three separate test runs) are shown in Table 12 as Catalyst 30. A control catalyst prepared similarly but with chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate that had not been azeotrope dried was used. The results of testing the undried preparation are shown as Catalyst 31 in Table 12.<br><br><br>
The example shows that drying the chromium component by azeotropic distillation prepares an effective catalyst and also will reduce equipment corrosion.<br>
Example 15<br>
An ethylene trimerization catalyst composition was prepared using methods known to those skilled in the art, placed in the catalyst feed tank (under inert conditions) of a continuous 1-hexene production process, and aged for approximately 900 hours. The continuous 1 -hexene production process was then started using the aged catalyst in the feed tank for the trimerization of ethylene to 1-hexene. Periodically, additional fresh ethylene trimerization catalyst was prepared and added to the catalyst used in the continuous 1-hexene production process. The average age of the ethylene oligomerization catalyst composition periodically calculated to determine the average time the catalyst had resided in the catalyst feed tank based upon the average catalyst composition in the catalyst feed tank. Throughout the continuous 1-hexene production process, samples of the continuous 1-hexene production process product we removed and analyzed for 1-hexene content. Fig. 5 shows the impact of the average catalyst residence time (i.e. catalyst age) on the purity of the hexene production produced by the continuous 1-hexene production process. Fig. 5 indicates that the purity of the 1-hexene product is negatively impacted by increasing age of the ethylene trimerizationcatalyst.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
