				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present relates to a process for producing a metallic honeycomb body which<br>
comprises at least partially structured metal foils, with passages being formed<br>
through which in particularly an exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine<br>
can flow. The metallic honeycomb body has at least one receptacle, which<br>
extends into the interior of the honeycomb body, for a sensor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Honey comb bodies with sensors of this type are used in particular for onboard<br>
diagnosis (OBD), the objective of which is the functional monitoring of catalytic<br>
converters for example in an exhaust system of an automobile. In this<br>
application, catalytic converters are used to convert pollutants (such as for<br>
example nitrogen oxides, unsaturated hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide)<br>
contained in the exhaust gas into constitutes which can be released into the<br>
environment in accordance with the current statutory provisions. On account of<br>
the fact that direct measurement of, for example, harmful hydrocarbons by<br>
means of a sensor does not currently appear possible, there are currently two<br>
methods which are used to monitor the functionality of catalytic converters.<br>
The objective of the first method is to determine the level of oxygen stored in<br>
the catalytic converter. For this purpose, an oxygen sensor is arranged both<br>
upstream and downstream of the catalytic converter, these sensors determining<br>
the oxygen content in the exhaust gas. Form this information, it is possible to<br>
draw conclusions as to the storage capacity of the catalytic converter and/or as<br>
to the progress of aging. The second method uses two thermal sensors, which<br>
are arranged directly upstream and downstream of the catalytic converter, to<br>
record the change in temperature of the exhaust gas. This is caused by thermal<br>
processes inside the catalytic converter, in particular exothermic reactions<br>
between the catalytic converter and the exhaust gas.<br>
In addition to arrangements of two sensors upstream and downstream of a<br>
catalytic converter of this type, German Utility Model DE 881 6154U has<br>
described a support body for a catalytic reactor for exhaust gas purification, the<br>
honeycomb body of which is composed of a single piece comprising corrugated<br>
metal strips. In this case, a sensor is arranged at the support body in such a<br>
manner that it extends into the interior of the metal honeycomb body.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed for the opening required for this installation to be<br>
produced by means of electron-beam or leaser cutting, cavity sinking or high-<br>
speed milling and grinding. Producing an opening of this type after the metallic<br>
honeycomb body has been formed has proven to be difficult in terms of the<br>
manufacturing technology required.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Working on this basis, it is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for producing a metallic honeycomb body which ensures a reliable<br>
production process which is suitable for series production.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the invention, the process for producing a metallic honeycomb body<br>
comprising at least partially structured metal foils, with passages being formed,<br>
through which in particular an exhaust gas from an internal combustion engine<br>
can flow, and which has at least one receptacle, which extends into the interior<br>
of the honeycomb body, for a sensor, includes the following steps:<br>
- producing recesses at at least one metal foil;<br>
- stacking and/or winding the metal foils in order to form a honeycomb<br>
structure, the at least one metal foil being arranged in such a manner that<br>
at least one receptacle which extends into the interior is formed;<br>
- introducing the metal foils into a tubular casing having an opening, the<br>
opening extending at least partially over the at at least one receptacle;<br>
- producing a connection, by joining technology, between the individual<br>
metal foils and/or between the metal foils and the tubular casing.<br>
The proposed process is distinguished in particular by the fact that essential<br>
production processes for forming the receptacle are performed even before the<br>
metal foils are stacked and/or wound to form a honeycomb structure. The result<br>
of this is that producing recesses of this type affects only the immediately<br>
adjoining areas of the at least one metal foil. By contrast, producing a<br>
corresponding receptacle using the conventional processes led to the<br>
deformation of a large number of adjacent metal foils, since these were already<br>
arranged close together. Deformation of this nature led in particular to passages<br>
becoming blocked, which in turn caused, for example, the efficiency of a catalytic<br>
converter or the pressure loss to be adversely affected. These drawbacks are<br>
avoided by the proposed process according to the invention, in which in<br>
particular the machining of each individual foil separately is preferred.<br>
According to a further configuration, it is proposed to produce a receptacle in the<br>
form of a blind bore. Accordingly, the recesses at the at least one metal foil are<br>
to be designed in such a way that after the stacking and/or winding operation<br>
they generate a receptacle which extends from the periphery of the honeycomb<br>
structure into inner regions. The dimensions of the blind bore are to be selected<br>
such that the blind bore is only slightly larger than the sensor which extends into<br>
the interior of the honeycomb body. This ensures that, despite a sensor being<br>
arranged in the interior of the honeycomb body, a sufficiently large number of<br>
passage have a completely continuous wall, providing the surface area required<br>
for catalytic conversion of pollutants in the exhaust gas.<br>
According to a further configuration, the metallic honeycomb body has metal<br>
foils with a thickness which is less than 0.03 mm. When using thin foils,<br>
subsequent machining (in the stacked and/or wound state) is particularly<br>
difficult, meaning that the proposed process is especially suitable for metal foils<br>
of this type.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process, the recesses are produced<br>
even before the structure of the metal foils has been generated. It is customary<br>
to build up metallic honeycomb bodies using smooth and corrugated metal foils.<br>
The corrugated metal foils are introduced into the metal foils using a rolling<br>
process. With regard to the production of the recesses, it is advantageous for<br>
them to be produced in advance, since it is possible to use relatively simple<br>
manufacturing processes. For example, it is possible in particular for the recesses<br>
to be stamped or trimmed out of the metal foils. This prevents damage to the<br>
structure of the metal foils.<br>
Furthermore, it is proposed for the metal foils to be initially at least partially<br>
structured and then for at least the metal foils which are intended to produced<br>
the receptacle to be stacked, the recesses then being produced with the aid of a<br>
high-energy beam or jet. This means in particular laser cutting processes, plasma<br>
cutting processes and water/abrasive jet cutting processes. In this case, the<br>
number of metal foils which are to be stacked and are machined simultaneously<br>
should preferably be restricted to 20, in particular 10 or 5 metal foils.<br>
According to yet another configuration of the process, the metal foils are initially<br>
stacked and are then wound in and S shape or are arranged in such a way that<br>
the metal foils run in an involute form from the inside outwards towards the<br>
tubular casing. In this case, the recesses are preferably produced prior to the<br>
stacking operation. The S-shaped or involute-shaped arrangement of the metal<br>
foils means that they each extend as far as the edge of the honeycomb body or<br>
as far as the tubular casing. This has the advantage that it is particularly simple<br>
to produce a corresponding recess. To do this, it is sufficiently to provide a<br>
predeterminable number of adjacent metal foils, as a function of the dimensions<br>
of the sensor, with recesses. The recesses directly form the desired receptacle.<br>
By contrast, if the metal foils are arranged helically, it is always necessary,<br>
during production of the recesses, to take account of the change in<br>
circumference, so that the recess of the wound metal layer is arranged over the<br>
recess of the previous metal layer.<br>
The recesses are in this case preferably U-shaped, with in particular adjacent<br>
metal foils having different depths. The U-shaped configuration of the recesses in<br>
particular allows the use of sensors in rod form. The slightly curved arrangement<br>
of the metal foils in the vicinity of the tubular casing is taken into account with<br>
the aid of preferably slight variations in the depth of the recesses in adjacent<br>
metal foils, this also, for example, ensuring the integration of sensors in rod form<br>
without the sensors making contact with the metal foils.<br>
According to an advantageous configuration of the process, the receptacle is<br>
designed in such a way that at least in sections it follows a profile of the metal<br>
foils. The result of this is that only a relatively small amount of adjacent metal<br>
foils have to be provided with recesses. In this case, the sensor to be used is<br>
preferably designed to match the profile of the metal foils. This prevents damage<br>
to the metal foils, while having only a very influence on the functionality of the<br>
honeycomb structure.<br>
Further advantageous configurations and particularly preferred embodiments are<br>
explained in more detail on the basis of the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIEMENTS OF<br>
INVENTION<br>
Fig. 1 shows a metallic honeycomb body 1 which has metal foils which at least<br>
in part are designed with structures 2 forming passages 4. A metallic honeycomb<br>
body 1 of this type is used in particular to purify exhaust gasses from an internal<br>
combustion engine, with the exhaust gas which is to be purified flowing through<br>
the passages 4 in the honeycomb body 1. The honeycomb body 1 has a<br>
receptacle 6 which extends into the interior 5 of the honeycomb body 1 and in<br>
which a sensor 7 is arranged. The receptacle 6 is formed by a number of<br>
recesses 8 which have been formed into a suitable number of metal foils 3. The<br>
metal foils 3 are in this case wound in an S shape and surrounded by tubular<br>
casing 10.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a stack of smooth and corrugated metal foils which together form a<br>
honeycomb structure 9. The metal foils 3 have a thickness 12 of preferably less<br>
than 0.03 mm. A stack of this type is then wound, for example, in an S shape. In<br>
order, in the process, by way of example, to produce a receptacle 6 as shown in<br>
Fig. 1, some metal sheets have recesses 8 which have a predeterminable depth<br>
14 starting from the edge of the metal foils which subsequently bears against the<br>
tubular casing 10. The depth 14 of the recesses 8 in adjacent metal foils 3 is in<br>
this case preferably to be designed to differ. In this context, it is advantageous<br>
for the metal foils to be machined individually using a cutting process.<br>
Fig. 3 diagrammatically depicts the sequence involved in producing the metallic<br>
honeycomb body 1, the metal foils 3 of which are wound helically. In this case, a<br>
smooth metal foil 3 and a structured metal foil 3 are placed on top of one<br>
another and the recesses 8 are produced with the aid of a high-energy beam or<br>
jet 13. In the process, by way of example, a nozzle is moved over the metal foils<br>
3 (as indicated by an arrow) in accordance with the desired shape of the recess<br>
8, in order to produce, for example, round recesses 8 with the aid of the water<br>
jet/abrasive jet cutting process. The metal foils 3 which have been treated in this<br>
way are wound up to form a honeycomb structure, with the distances between<br>
the adjacent recesses 8 being designed in such a manner that they always<br>
overlap one another during the winding operation. When the honeycomb<br>
structure has reached a predetermined diameter, the metal foils 3 supplied are<br>
served and the honeycomb structured is introduced into a tubular casing 10. The<br>
tabular casing 10 has an opening 11 which is oriented in such a way that it is<br>
arranged at least partially above the openings 8. In this way, a receptacle 6 (not<br>
shown) is formed, in which a sensor 7 can subsequently be arranged.<br>
Fig. 4 diagrammatically depicts a cross section through an embodiment of a<br>
metallic honeycomb body 1 with metal foils 3, with the structure 2 (not shown)<br>
in this case having been disregarded. The metal foils 3 are in this case arranged<br>
in a tubular casing 10, forming an involute-like profile 19. The receptacle 6<br>
formed by the metal metal foils 3 in this case, in a section 18, follows the profile<br>
19, as does a sensor 7 which has been arranged in the receptacle 6 and is<br>
shaped suitably. The sensor 7 is in this case fixed in the original 11 in the tubular<br>
casing 10 by means of a holder 15. The sensor 7 is of at least partially elastic or<br>
deformable design, in order to facilitate the introduction of the sensor 7 into the<br>
receptacle 6. The number of the metal foils 3 with recesses 8 (not shown) is in<br>
this way limited to less than 20, in particular less than 10.<br>
Fig. 5 diagrammatically depicts a detailed view of a coated honeycomb<br>
structured 9. The passages 4 of the honeycomb structure 9 are delimited by the<br>
metal foils 3, with a metal foil 3 with a structure 2 and a smooth metal foil 3<br>
being wound alternately. The metal foils in this case have a thickness 12 of less<br>
than 0.03 mm. In view of the preferred use of honeycomb bodies of this type as<br>
catalyst support bodies for exhaust gas purification, the honeycomb structure 9<br>
illustrated has a catalytically active coating 16. During the purification process,<br>
the coating 16 comes into contact with the exhaust gas flowing through the<br>
passages 4, the precious metal 17 including the coating 16 allowing the<br>
pollutants to be converted.<br>
The process according to the invention prevents manufacturing damage to<br>
passages during the retrospective production of receptacles for sensors and<br>
thereby ensures, for example, particularly effective conversion of exhaust gases.<br>
