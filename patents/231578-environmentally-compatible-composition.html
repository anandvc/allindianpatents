				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an environmentally compatible composition formulated for use with trees and plants, fruits and vegetables by spraying the trees and plants, fruits and vegetables to enhance the growth thereof and to effectively control insects and fungi.<br>
Background Art<br>
Various insects such as lice, ticks, mite, aphides and chiggers attack untreated and unprotected trees and plants. Moreover, fungi left uncontralled can damage and even destroy plants and trees including crops associated therewith.<br>
In the past, various oiis have been used to control insects and mites. Recently, however, renewed attention has focused on the use of oils as a natural substitute  for traditional insecticides with attendant toxic and other dangerous side effects.<br>
"These oiis include horticultural oils that are highly refined petroleum products than can be mixed witti water for application for control of target insect and mite pests without deleterious effects. Modern horticultural oils do not include vegetable, fish or whale oils.<br>
Horticultural spray oils are the low toxicity alternative to broad spectrum insecticides. Since the mechanism of insect and mite control with spray oils is by suffocation and/or repellency of egg laying females, there is no requirement for the addition of toxic chemicals. These properties are a valuable and well recognized component of the practice of integrated pest management where oil spraying is intrinsically linked to natural control of pests by predators and parasitoids.<br>
Horticultural spray oils are formulated on highly refined clear oil with a minimum of nonionic surfactant. Independent environmental impact studies have shown that D-C-TRON has no detrimental effect on the environment. Mammalian toxicity studies published in the American Journal of Industrial Medicine have shown that oils at this refinement level are non-toxic and non-carcinogenic.<br>
Generally, oil sprays are safe to humans. These oil sprays have little, if any, negative effect on wildlife and non-target insects in the environment. Furthermore, oil sprays are less toxic due to the method by which they kill target pests. In particular, the thin film of oil covers the target insect or mite and plugs the spiracles or pores through which the pests or parasites breathe. The cause of death is primarily suffocation. Large, motile insects and animals that breathe by another method are not affected by these oils.<br>
Another advantage of oil applications is the absence of objectionable odors. In addition, oils are relatively inexpensive and significantly less expensive than many insecticides.<br>
Unfortunately, there are limitations to the use of oil treatments. For example, oils are only effective against those pests that are thoroughly coated by the spray solution. This usually means that only small, immobile or slow moving pests that are exposed on the surface of the plant or tree at the time of application will be controlled.<br>
Since oil sprays only work by contracting and covering the target pest, thorough application is essential. Missed surface areas provide a safe refuge for the target pests.<br>
U.S. 6,258,369 and U.S. 6,277,389 disclose a non-toxic aqueous pesticide for application on plants and animals comprising at least one surfactant and at least<br>
one high terpene containing natural oil. The pesticide is used to effectively control insects and parasites such as darkling beetles, lice, ticks, mites, flies, aphides, mosquitoes and chiggers found on plants and animals.<br>
U.S. 5,693,344 shows a hazard-free method for controlling insects using a non-toxic composition in the form of a fragrance and crystalline particles which puncture directly through the exoskeleton of an insect, In operation, the particles work themselves between the insect's protective body plates and then puncture the exoskeleton permitting entry of the fragrance into the body of the insect. Once inside, the particles absorb up to four times their weight of the vital body fluids of the insect and the fragrance has a neural effect on the insect.<br>
U.S. 5,143,939 shows a method of treating soil and agricultural crops for controlling worms and nematodes comprising a nonionic surfactant, namely an alkylox-ypolyethyleneoxyethanol used as the sole active ingredient to control fungus, mites, worms, termites, nematodes and other insects.<br>
U.S. 4,379,168 relates to pesticides containing d-limonene as an insect-killing ingredient with surfactants or emulsifiers and water. The pesticide compositions are liquids designed for use as a dip to rid small animals of fleas and ticks, a spray to kill fleas and ticks on small animals and in the kennels of small animals; a spray to kill fies on small animals and in the kennels of small animals; and a spray or liquid to rid household areas of cockroaches and other insect pests.<br>
U.S. 6,248,710 Bl discloses a water-soluble or water-dispersible material for deposition onto a fabric substrate during a treatment process comprising polysaccharide structure having at least one substituent benefit agent group and optionally, one or more other substituent groups. The polysaccharide structure has<br>
one or more regions with at least 3, preferably at least 4 consecutive unsubstituted<br>
saccharide rings.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an environmentally compatible composition<br>
formulated for use with various plants and trees, fruits and vegetables comprising at<br>
least one surfactant and at least one high terpene containing oil to kill various<br>
insects ;and reduce and control fungi. The invention also includes the method of<br>
application of the composition.<br>
High terpene containing natural oil as used herein means those natural oils having a terpene content of at least 50 per cent It is preferable that the high<br>
terpene natural oil contains at least 65 per cent. Suitable high terpene containing natural oils includes oil from conifers such as citrus peel oils, preferably orange oil, grapefruit oil, lemon oil or pine oil. Of these, orange oil is preferred and cold pressed "orange oil the most preferred. The preferred terpene content is from about 80 per cent to about 90 per cent and most preferred from about 85 per cent to about 87 per cent, all by weight<br>
The amount of high terpene containing natural oils in the composition depends upon the amount of terpenes in the specific oil used. Generally, the composition contains from about 3 per cent by weight to about 7 per cent by weight of high terpene containing natural oil, preferably about 5 per cent by weight<br>
Anionic and nonionic surfactants are acceptable for use in the composition of the present invention. Anionic surfactants such as salts of fatty adds, alkyl sulphates, alkyl ether sulphonates and alkyl aryl sulphonates are preferred.<br>
The composition may also contain preservatives, pH neutralizers and/or clarifiers or stabiliiers. The balance of the composition is water.<br>
In use, the biorational insecticide and fungicide is diluted and sprayed or misted on the plants or trees, fruits or vegetables.<br>
When so applied, the composition is effective in controlling various insects including darkling beetles, lice, ticks, mites, flies, aphides, thrips, mealybugs, mosquitoes and chiggers. While not to be bound by theory, the mechanism of insect control is believed to be the breakdown of the protective covering of soft bodied insects, exposing the insects to atmospheric conditions leading to desiccation and eventual death. Flying insects lose the use of their wings caused by the loss of the protective covering and loss of tension in the wings. Initially after spraying the wings tend to stick together, preventing the insect from escaping. Apart from Ihis, it is believed that these products may also enter the digestive and respiratory tracts, debilitating the insects, eventually leading to their demise.<br>
The composition is also effective In controlling fungi. While not to be bound by theory, mechanism of fungi control Is believed to be the wetting of the surface protective layer on the fungal mycelia, sproangia and spores, exposing them to the drying capabilities of the atmosphere. The same happens to plant tissue damaged by the fungus, but healthy plant tissue such as leaves and shoots is not affected. Dying of the fungal mycelia prevents the spread of mycelia into new tissue, while the sporangia cannot sporulate to form new infective spores. Spores that have already spread and are lying dormant, waiting for favorable conditions, may also be affected in the same way.<br>
Finally, the composition enhances water penetration and absorption by the soil as well as decreases waterlogging. These better soil conditions lead to improved root and plant growth.<br>
There is no requirement for the addition of toxic chemicals thereby causing an imbalance in the insect and/or parasite's delicate body moisture balance. As such, the instant invention provides a virtually non-toxic alternative to broad spectrum insecticides.<br>
The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements, and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified in the construction hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims. Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
