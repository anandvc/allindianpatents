				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of non-hydrogenated fats. The process in particular describes the method of preparation of bakery shortenings and vanaspati with no trans fatty acids.<br>
Currently, fats prepared by hydrogenation are being used in bakery and in traditional sweetmeat industries. Hydrogenated fats normally contain large quantity (40-50%) of trans fatty acids. Although, the nutritional significance of trans fatty acids is controversial, it has been found that they are the risk factors involved in coronary heart disease and a comprehensive review concluded that trans fatty acids consumed at 4% or more of total calories may raise plasma lipid levels. Hence, there is a demand for fats having natural fatty acids without any trans isomers. Fats prepared in the present invention do not contain any trans fatty acids and could be utilized in bakery industry for preparation of various types of products such as pastries, biscuit, cakes etc. and also in traditional sweetmeats.<br>
Reference may be made to Sundram, K. et.al., 1999, USP 5,874,117, wherein blends containing 50-95 % of palm fat and 5-50% corn oil providing oxidation resistant shortenings for baking and frying, are prepared. Also, increasing PUFA content of palm fat shortening by supplementing with 5 to 100% corn oils was claimed. The drawbacks of the invention are, mainly blending of palm fat and corn oil is reported. Fractionation of palm fat nor blending it with mahua or ricebran oils are reported.<br>
Reference may be made to Wheeler, E.Let.al.,1995, USP 5,407,695, wherein low palmitic, reduced trans margarines and shortenings were prepared by<br>
blending 75-25% of an edible oil with 25-75% of fully hydrogenated vegetable oil bearing C16 to C24 acid, wherein atleast 15% of C16 in hydrogenated oil are replaced by short chain acids like acetic, propionic, butyric or mixtures of any of these. The drawbacks of the invention are: hydrogenated fats are used and are interesterified to obtain triglycerides having lower chain acids.<br>
Reference may be made to Scavone, T.A... 1995 USP 5,470,598, beta prime stable low saturate low trans all purpose shortening, consisting of less than 10% of trans fatty acids and less than 16% C4-C26 fatty acids and 10-20% of beta prime stable hardstock consisting of atleast 65% of PSP &amp; PSS at a ratio of 0.8 to 1.0, and 0-30% consists of triglycerides or synthetic fats and 0-5% monoglycerides or diglycerides and added antioxidants was prepared. The drawbacks of the invention are: hydrogenated fats are used and also emulsifiers and antioxidants are incorporated and base oils selected are derived from sunflower, soybean, olive, corn, canola, peanut, safflower, and mixtures thereof, hydrogenated vegetable, animal or marine oils, modified oils, microbial, synthetic oils, fully hydrogenated fractionated palm oil. The drawbacks of the invention are: hydrogenated oils, animal, marine oils used in the invention. The process of fractionation and blending were not reported and also the base oils used are different from the present invention.<br>
Reference may be made to Yang, D.K., 1989, USP 4,883,684, wherein functional hard stock composition useful in plastic shortenings, having triglycerides containing 18:2 and other 2 acyl groups selected from C18:0 to C26:0 fatty acyl groups and are free of C12:0 and C16:0 acids was prepared. The drawbacks of the invention are: hydrogenated fats and blending with liquid oils and emulsifiers were reported.<br>
Reference may be made to Keuning, R. et.al, 1982, USP 4,360,536, wherein process for dry fractionation of palm kernel, coconut, babassu oils in presence of palm oil triglycerides, and resulting fat blend is useful for preparation margarine and shortenings is reported. The drawbacks of the invention are: fractionation of lauric acid rich oils with palm oil triglycerides to get pourable margarines were patented, which is different from the present invention, where lauric acid oils are not used and only fractionation of palmitic acid rich oil is used for the preparation.<br>
Reference may be made to Rek; Johannes, H.M., 1982, USP 4,350,715, wherein an edible plastic fat based composition having at least 80% fat phase, which consists of at least 50% butterfat to improve whipping and creaming properties and at least 10% fat selected from palm kernel fat and shea stearin. The drawbacks of the invention are: milk fat, palm kernel oils and shea fraction are used and the composition consists of only 80% fatty phase and is an oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Reference may be made to Luddy, F.E., et.al, 1978, USP 4,130,572, wherein beef tallow is dry fractionated and liquid fraction is used as a base in<br>
production of salad oils, margarines, shortenings. The drawbacks of the invention are: the animal fat is fractionated into different fractions and these fractions are used for preparation of salad oils, margarines, shortenings.<br>
Reference may be made to Anon, 1976, British Patent 1,455,581, wherein fat blend suitable for preparation of margarines and shortenings, based on palm fat co-randomized with non-palm based fats consisting of C44 and higher triglycerides, 30-80% of the total fatty acid residues are derived from palm based fat is prepared. In this invention interesterification process is used to prepare margarines and shortenings, which is different from the present invention, where only fractionation and blending are employed.<br>
Reference may be made to Anon, 1976, Netherland Patent Application 7,602,176, wherein a fat product suitable for shortenings and emulsified spreads from randomly transesterified and non-transesterified components derived from palm oii such that it contains 15-25% SUS triglycerides and has a SUS : SSU ratio of 0.8 to 2.0 is prepared.<br>
Reference may be made to Kriz, E.F., 1976 , USP 3,985,911, wherein process for forming pastry shortening from mixtures of vegetable and animal fats by chilling rapidly to 62-80 °F, and kneading and extruding is reported. The drawbacks of the invention are: only process for forming shortening like chilling, kneading, extruding are reported.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to prepare bakery shortenings and vanaspati with no trans fatty acids.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of non-hydrogenated fats with no trans fatty acids which comprises heating palm oil at 60°C to obtain melt, dry fractionation of palmitic acid rich melt at a temperature ranging from 25-35°C for a time period ranging from 1 to 4 hours to obtain a stearin fraction in 20-40% yield blending the stearin fraction with other low-palmitic acid vegetable oils or fats in the range of 30-60% by wt of stearin and 70-40% by wt of vegetable oils or fats to obtain non-hydrogenated fats with no trans fatty acids.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, palmitic acid rich fat may be fractionated without using any solvents at a temperature ranging from 25 to 35°C for a period of 1 to 4 hours to obtain preferably 20-40% of hard stearin fraction.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, palmitic acid rich fat may be fractionated without using any solvents at a temperature ranging from 25 to 35°C for a period of 1 to 4 hours to obtain preferably 20-40% of hard stearin fraction.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, palmitic acid fat fraction may be blended with low-palmitic vegetable oils/fats preferably in the ratio of 30-60 to 70-40.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, low palmitic acid oils or fats may be selected from mahua, ricebran or sunflower.<br>
The formulation are prepared by mixing palm oil stearin 30-60% and other low-palmitic acid vegetable oils or fats in the range of 40-70% having solid fat content as follows;<br>
20 °C	0-60%<br>
30 °C	40-55%<br>
35°C	25-40%<br>
40° C	10-20%<br>
45 C	0-5%<br>
The formulations prepared in the present invention did not contain any trans fatty acids and had plasticity similar to those of commercial hydrogenated fats suitable for use in bakery and in other culinary purposes.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Refined palm oil (500 g) is heated to 60°C to destroy all crystal' nuclei. The melt is gradually cooled with stirring to 30 °C and held at this temperature for 2 hours. The partially crystallized mass was filtered through buchner funnel under vacuum. The yield of hard stearin fraction was 25% by wt. of the oil.<br>
The hard stearin fraction obtained was blended with refined mahua fat, so as to get the formulations having 50% of palm oil fraction and 50% of mahua fat.<br>
The resultant formulation consists of solids fat content (%)<br>
