				<td>GLASS ARTICLE HAVING A ZINC OXIDE COATING<br>
AND METHOD FOR MAKING SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
        This invention relates to a highly doped zinc oxide coated glass article<br>
exhibiting high visible light transmittance with low total solar energy<br>
transmittance.<br>
        Coatings on architectural glass are commonly utilized to provide specific<br>
energy absorption and light transmittance properties. Additionally, coatings<br>
provide desired reflective or spectral properties that are aesthetically pleasing.<br>
The coated articles are often used singularly or in combination with other<br>
coated articles to form a glazing or window unit.<br>
        Coated glass articles may be produced "on-line" by continuously coating<br>
a glass substrate while it Is being manufactured in a process known in the art<br>
as the "float glass process." Additionally, coated glass articles are produced<br>
"off-line" through a sputtering process. The former process involves casting<br>
glass onto a molten tin bath which is suitably enclosed, thereafter transferring<br>
the glass, after it is sufficiently cooled, to lift out rolls which are aligned with the<br>
bath, and finally cooling the glass as it advances across the rolls, initially<br>
through a lehr, and thereafter, while exposed to the ambient atmosphere. A<br>
non-oxidizing atmosphere is maintained in the float portion of the process,<br>
while the glass is In contact with the molten tin bath, to prevent oxidation of tin.<br>
An oxidizing atmosphere is maintained in the lehr. In general, the coatings are<br>
applied onto the glass substrate in the float bath of the float bath process.<br>
However, coatings may also be applied onto the substrate in the lehr.<br>
        The attributes of the resulting coated glass substrate are dependent<br>
upon the specific coatings applied during the float glass process or an off-line<br>
sputtering process. The coating compositions and thicknesses impart energy<br>
absorption and light transmittance properties within the coated article while also<br>
affecting the spectral properties. Desired attributes may be obtainable by<br>
adjusting the compositions or thicknesses of the coating layer or layers.<br>
However, adjustments to enhance a specific property can adversely impact<br>
other transmittance or spectral properties of the coated glass article. Obtaining<br>
         <br>
desired spectral properties is often difficult when trying to combine specific<br>
energy absorption and light transmittance properties in a coated glass article. It<br>
is also difficult to obtain useful film thicknesses as the available deposition time<br>
in on-line processes is mere seconds, as the continuous glass ribbon is moving<br>
at a speed of several hundred inches per minute.<br>
Deposition of zinc oxide coatings is known from the patent literature.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,751,149 describes a method of applying a zinc oxide<br>
coating to substrate at a low temperature by using a mixture of an organozinc<br>
compound and water carried in an inert gas. The resulting zinc oxide film is<br>
said to have relatively low resistivity which can be varied by addition of a Group<br>
III element.<br>
        U.S. Patent no. 4.990, 286 describes zinc oxy-fluoride films produced by<br>
CVD from vapor mixtures of zinc, oxygen and fluorine-containing compounds.<br>
Electrical conductivity of the film is said to be increased by substituting fluorine<br>
from some of the oxygen in the zinc oxide. The resulting films are said to be<br>
transparent, electrically conductive and infrared reflecting.<br>
        U.S. Patent No. 6,071,561 describes a method of depositing fluorine-<br>
doped zinc oxide films utilizing vaporized precursor compounds such as a<br>
chelate of dialkylzinc, more specifically utilizing an amine chelate, an oxygen<br>
source and a fluorine source. The coatings produced are said to be electrically<br>
conductive, IR reflective, UV absorbing and free of carbon.<br>
        U.S. Patent No. 6,416,814 describes the utilization of ligated compounds<br>
of tin, titanium and zinc as CVD precursor compounds to form metal oxide<br>
coatings on heated substrates.<br>
        U.S. Patent No. 6,858,306 describes a glass substrate having disposed<br>
thereon a multi-layer coating of an antimony doped tin oxide, and a coating of<br>
fluorine doped tin oxide. The glass substrate so coated exhibits low emittance<br>
and high solar selectivity, thus providing improved heat rejection in summer<br>
and heat retention in winter while still permitting the transmittance of a relatively<br>
high degree_of visible light.<br>
        Deposition of highly doped zinc oxide has been reported in the scientific<br>
literature for use in, for example, solar cells. Some examples of such articles<br>
follow:<br>
         <br>
        Park et al. report deposition of highly doped ZnO films via pulsed laser<br>
deposition (see Japanese Journal of Applied Physics. Vol. 44, No. 11,2205, pp.<br>
88027-31). Using aluminum as the dopant, samples with an electron<br>
concentration of 1.25 x 1021cm-3. and an electron mobility of 37.6 cm2N-s were<br>
said to have been produced. The investigators state that doped zinc oxide<br>
films can be used as transparent contacts in solar cells, laser diodes, ultra-<br>
violet lasers, thin film resistors, flat panel displays, and organic light-emitting<br>
diodes.<br>
        Similarly, Singh et al. (Journal of Indian Institute of Science, Vol. 81,<br>
Sept-Oct 2001. pp. 527-533) describe deposition of highly doped ZnO by<br>
pulsed laser ablation. Using a zinc oxide target doped with 2% aluminum<br>
oxide, ZnO:AI samples with an electron concentration of 1.5 x 1021cm-3 and an<br>
electron mobility of 29 cm'3 /V-s were said to have been produced.<br>
        Das and Ray deposited aluminum doped zinc oxide films by rf-<br>
magnetron sputtering, the films obtained were said to exhibit an electron<br>
concentration of 2.3 x 1021 cm'3. (Journal of Physics P: Applied Physics. Vol.<br>
36, 2003. pp. 152-5.)<br>
        Finally, Choiet al. deposited gallium doped zinc oxide by rf-magnetron<br>
sputtering and claims to have produced films exhibiting an electron<br>
concentration of 1.5 x 1021 cm3. (Thin Solid Films. Vol. 192-4, 1990, pp. 712-<br>
720.)<br>
        It would be advantageous to provide a coated glass article having a<br>
neutral tint that rejects solar energy in the summer and provides a low U value<br>
for the winter. A solar reducing glazing with a low emittance, and a low total<br>
solar energy transmittance, would significantly improve energy costs in<br>
buildings and homes while providing a desirable neutral tint.<br>
        It would also be advantageous to provide a solar reducing glazing that<br>
has a neutral color in reflectance, a low emittance, a high visible light<br>
transmittance, and a low total solar energy transmittance. The use of such a<br>
neutral colored article in architectural glazings would permit the transmission of<br>
a high degree of visible light while rejecting a significant amount of near<br>
infrared energy. Furthermore, the low emittance characteristic of the glazing<br>
would minimize any indirect heat gain from absorption.<br>
         <br>
                   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention, there is provided a novel glass article<br>
useful for producing coated, heat reducing glass for architectural windows. The<br>
coated article includes a glass substrate having a coating of a highly doped<br>
zinc oxide deposited over the glass substrate and optionally, a protective<br>
overcoat deposited on and adhering to the surface of the coating of doped zinc<br>
oxide deposited on the heated glass substrate. Such protective overcoat may<br>
comprise any suitably durable thin film having a compatible refractive index.<br>
Examples of such protective overcoats are undoped tin oxide, silica and<br>
titanium oxide. Such protective overcoat may, optionally, be doped to render<br>
same electrically conductive. For example, tin oxide may be doped with<br>
fluorine.<br>
        The coated glass article of the invention has a selectivity of 26 or more,<br>
preferably 33 or more, the selectivity being defined as the difference between<br>
visible light transmittance (llluminant C) and total solar energy transmittance.<br>
integrated with an air mass 1.5. The coating stack, when applied to a clear<br>
glass substrate having a nominal 6 mm thickness, has a visible light<br>
transmittance of 69% or more and a preferred total solar energy transmittance<br>
of less than 41%.<br>
        Preferably, the coated glass article includes an iridescence-suppressing<br>
intertayer deposited between the heated glass substrate and the coating of<br>
doped zinc oxide. These coatings are such as to provide a neutral color in<br>
transmittance and reflectance when applied to a clear glass substrate.<br>
        The doped zinc oxide coating in the coated glass article of the invention<br>
provides for the absorption of solar energy. While this includes the absorption<br>
of some visible light, the doped zinc oxide coating is relatively selective,<br>
absorbing more near infrared energy than visible light. The doped zinc coating<br>
thus reduces the total solar energy transmittance of the coated glass article of<br>
the invention.<br>
        A method of forming the coated glass article of the present invention is<br>
also disclosed. While atmospheric chemical vapor deposition is the preferred<br>
method of deposition, other methods may be utilized.<br>
         <br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
        The above, as well as other advantages of the present invention, will<br>
become readily apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed<br>
description when considered in the light of the accompanying drawings in<br>
which:<br>
        Fig. 1 is a schematic view, in vertical section, of an apparatus for<br>
practicing the float glass process, which includes four gas distributors suitably<br>
positioned in the float bath to apply coatings onto the glass substrate in<br>
accordance with the invention;<br>

the invention; and<br>
        Fig. 3 is a diagram of an architectural glazing in accordance with the<br>
present invention, wherein the coated glass article is shown in an insulated<br>
glass unit as an outboard lite with the multilayer coating of the invention facing<br>
the interior.<br>
          DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the invention, a coated glass article having a<br>
multilayered coating of a highly doped zinc oxide layer over which an optional<br>
protective overcoat of, for example, a substantially undoped tin oxide layer is<br>
applied, provides an article which exhibits a low emittance, a high visible light<br>
transmittance, and a reduced total solar energy transmittance. The coated<br>
glass article is especially suitable for use in architectural glazings and windows.<br>
However, the coated glass article of the present invention may also be suitable<br>
for other applications, such as vehicle windows.<br>
        The highly doped zinc oxide coating also lowers the emissivity of the<br>
coated glass article of the invention to less than 0.15, and preferably to less<br>
than 0.10. As part of an insulating glass unit, the low emittance value provides<br>
a winter time U-value of less than 0.34, and preferably less than 0.32. In<br>
addition, it has surprisingly been determined that the solar selectivity of the film<br>
stack described is more than twice that of previously known multilayer coatings<br>
having otherwise similar solar control properties.<br>
         <br>
        Preferably, tin oxide or other metal oxide coating is utilized to form an<br>
overcoat to protect the somewhat mechanically and chemically fragile zinc<br>
oxide coating. The protective overcoat may slightly increase the emissivity of<br>
the coating stack. In order to minimize emissivity changes, the thickness of the<br>
protective layer is preferably less than 1000 A. Alternatively, a protective layer<br>
consisting of tin oxide having a thickness greater than 1000 A could be doped<br>
with fluorine, niobium, or tantalum to achieve the desired emissivity.<br>
        The specific coating stack on the glass substrate provides a neutral<br>
colored article having a high visible light transmittance, a reduced total solar<br>
energy transmittance, and a low emittance. The use of the inventive article in<br>
architectural glazings results in a glazing that rejects solar energy in the<br>
summer and provides a low U-value for the winter.<br>
        Preferably, the coated glass article includes an iridescence-suppressing<br>
interlayer deposited between the glass substrate and the coating of doped zinc<br>
oxide. The coatings are such as to provide a neutral color in transmittance and<br>
reflectance when applied to a clear glass substrate.<br>
        Fig. 2 illustrates the coated glass article of the invention, indicated<br>
generally by reference numeral 35, comprising a glass substrate 36 and a<br>
multilayered coating 37 adhered to one surface thereof. In the preferred<br>
embodiment illustrated, the multilayered coating comprises an iridescence-<br>
suppressing interlayer 38, a coating of doped zinc oxide 41, and a protective<br>
outer coating 42, for example, an undoped or fluorine doped tin oxide. In the<br>
embodiment illustrated, the iridescence-suppressing interlayer 38 is specifically<br>
comprised of a tin oxide coating 39 and a silicon dioxide coating 40.<br>
For most applications it will be preferred that the doped zinc oxide<br>
coating 41 in the coated glass article of the invention provides especially for the<br>
absorption of solar energy. While this includes the absorption of some visible<br>
light, the doped zinc oxide coating is relatively selective, absorbing more near<br>
infrared energy than visible light. The doped zinc oxide coating thus reduces<br>
the total solar energy transmittance of the coated glass article of the invention.<br>
The highly doped zinc oxide coating 41 includes a molar ratio of dopant<br>
to zinc of between about 0.1 % and 5%. Preferably, the molar ratio of dopant to<br>
zinc is between about 1% and 3%. The molar ratio will vary depending on the<br>
<br>
dopant selected from one or more of aluminum, gallium, indium and boron.<br>
Aluminum and gallium are preferred dopants. The doped zinc oxide coating 41<br>
preferably has a free electron concentration of greater than 1.0 x 1021 cm-3, and<br>
more preferably has a free electron concentration greater than or equal to 1.5 x<br>
1021 cm-3. The doped zinc oxide coating 41 is preferably deposited at a<br>
thickness of from about 1600 to about 9000 Angstroms, and preferably from<br>
about 1800 to about 5200 Angstroms. The most preferred coating thickness<br>
will depend on the free electron concentration in the zinc oxide coating as well<br>
as the glass thickness. As the thickness of the zinc oxide coating, doped with<br>
one or more of the previously noted dopants in the indicated molar ratio range,<br>
is increased above 9000 Angstroms, the absorption of visible light increases to<br>
the point that the visible light transmittance becomes undesirably low.<br>
However, as the thickness of the zinc oxide coating, doped in the indicated<br>
molar ratio range, is decreased below 1600 Angstroms, the total solar energy<br>
transmission becomes undesirably high<br>
        The highly doped zinc oxide coating 41 lowers the emissivity of the<br>
coated glass article of the invention to less than 0.15, and preferably to less<br>
than 0.10. As part of an insulating glass unit, a sheet of glass coated with<br>
doped zinc oxide held in a spaced apart relationship from an uncoated sheet of<br>
clear glass by a frame member, the low emittance value provides a winter time<br>
U-value of less than 0.34, and preferably less than 0.32. In addition, it has<br>
surprisingly been determined that in accordance with the invention, the<br>
insulating glass unit exhibits solar selectivity greater than or equal to 28, and<br>
preferably greater than or equal to 33.<br>
        The optional tin oxide overcoat 42 is preferably applied at a thickness of<br>
less than 1000 Angstroms, and even more preferably at a thickness from about<br>
200 to about 250 Angstroms.<br>
        The iridescence-suppressing interlayer 38 of the coating stack on the<br>
glass substrate 36 provides a means to reflect and refract light to interfere with<br>
the observance of iridescence. The layer specifically eliminates iridescence so<br>
that the coated article may, if desired, be neutral colored in both reflectance<br>
and transmittance. Furthermore, the interlayer suppresses the observance of<br>
off angle colors. Indescence-suppressing coatings are conventionally known<br>
         <br>
within the art. For example, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,187,336, 4,419,386, and<br>
4,206,252, each herein incorporated by reference, describe coating techniques<br>
suitable for suppressing interference colors. Single layer, multiple layer, or<br>
gradient layer color suppression coatings are suitable for use with the present<br>
invention.<br>
        In the two component interlayer 38 illustrated in Fig. 2, which is the<br>
preferred type of iridescence-suppressing interiayer for use in the practice of<br>
the present Invention, the coating 39 deposited onto and adhering to the glass<br>
substrate has a high refractive index in the visible spectrum and is preferably<br>
tin oxide. The second coating 40, having a low refractive index, is deposited on<br>
and adheres to the first coating of the interiayer, and is preferably silicon<br>
dioxide. Generally, each coating has a thickness selected such that the<br>
interiayer forms a combined total optical thickness of about 1/6th to about 1/12th<br>
of a 500 nm design wavelength.<br>
        Various deposition methods may be suitable to deposit the desired zinc<br>
oxide film stack, for example, various sputtering techniques. Chemical vapor<br>
deposition (CVD) is a preferred method of deposition. Atmospheric pressure<br>
chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) is particularly preferred.<br>
        The glass substrates suitable for use In preparing the coated glass<br>
article according to the present invention may include any of the conventional<br>
glass compositions known in the art as useful for the preparation of<br>
architectural glazings. The preferred substrate is a clear float glass ribbon<br>
wherein the coatings of the present invention are applied in the heated zone of<br>
the float glass process where temperatures are in the range of 500-700°C.<br>
Additionally, tinted glass substrates may be suitable for applying the<br>
multilayered stack of the invention. However, certain tinted glass substrates<br>
may impact the spectral and energy transmittance properties of the invention.<br>
        The specific coating stack on the glass substrate provides a coated<br>
glass article having a high visible light transmittance, a reduced total solar<br>
energy transmittance, and a low emittance. The coated glass article of the<br>
invention has a selectivity of 28 or more, the selectivity being defined as the<br>
difference between visible light transmittance (liluminant C) and a total solar<br>
energy transmittance, integrated with an air mass 1.5, on a clear glass<br>
         <br>
substrate at a nominal 3 mm thickness. The selectivity is preferably 33 or<br>
more, with a preferred visible light transmittance of 73% or more and a<br>
preferred total solar energy transmittance of less than 41 %. The emittance of<br>
the present inventive article is less than 0.15, and preferably less than 0.10.<br>
Emittance or emissivity is a measure of both absorption and reflectance of light<br>
at given wavelengths. It is usually represented by the formula: Emissivity = 1-<br>
reflectance of the coating. The term emissivity is used to refer to emissivity<br>
values measured in the infrared range by ASTM standards. Emissivity is<br>
measured using radiometric measurements and is reported as hemispherical<br>
emissivity (eh) and normal emissivity. The use of the inventive article in<br>
architectural glazings results in a glazing that rejects solar energy in the<br>
summer and provides a low U value for the winter.<br>
        The multilayered coatings of the present invention result in a coated<br>
glass article preferably exhibiting neutral color in both reflectance and<br>
transmittance. The color is defined by the composition and thickness of the<br>
various layers of the stack.<br>
        In order to most effectively achieve color neutrality, it may be desirable<br>
to vary the thickness of the tin oxide and silica layers of the iridescence-<br>
suppressing interlayer between 150 Angstroms and 350 Angstroms. It is also<br>
important that, with respect to the subject invention, color neutrality is not<br>
strictly defined by mathematical limits, but also as perceived by the human eye<br>
in viewing the reflective color and the transmitted color.<br>
        The coatings of the present Invention are preferably applied "on-line"<br>
onto the glass substrate by chemical vapor deposition during the glass<br>
manufacturing process. Fig. 1 illustrates an apparatus, indicated generally at<br>
10, useful for the on-line production of the coated glass article of the present<br>
invention, comprising a float section 11, a lehr 12, and a cooling section 13.<br>
The float section 11 has a bottom 14 which contains a molten tin bath 15, a roof<br>
16, sidewalls (not shown), and end walls 17, which together form a seal such<br>
that there is provided an enclosed zone 18, wherein a non-oxidizing<br>
atmosphere is maintained, as hereinafter described in greater detail, to prevent<br>
oxidation of the tin bath 15. During operation of the apparatus 10, molten glass<br>
19 is cast onto a hearth 20, and flows therefrom under a metering wall 21, then<br>
         <br>
downwardly onto the surface of the tin bath 15. from which it is removed by lift-<br>
out rolls 22 and conveyed through the lehr 12. and thereafter through the<br>
cooling section 13.<br>
        A non-oxidizing atmosphere is maintained in the float section 11 by<br>
introducing a suitable gas, such as for example one composed of 99 percent by<br>
volume nitrogen and 1 percent by volume hydrogen, into the zone 18, through<br>
 conduits 23 which are operably connected to a manifold 24. The non-oxidizing<br>
gas is introduced into the zone 18 from the conduits 23 at a rate sufficient to<br>
compensate for losses of the gas (some of the non-oxidizing atmosphere<br>
leaves the zone 18 by flowing under the end walls 17), and to maintain a slight<br>
positive pressure, conveniently about 0.001 to about 0.01 atmospheres above<br>
ambient pressure. The tin bath 15 and the enclosed zone 18 are heated by<br>
radiant heat directed downwardly from heaters 25. The heat zone 18 is<br>
generally maintained at a temperature of about 500-700°C. The atmosphere in<br>
the lehr 12 is typically air, and the cooling section 13 is not enclosed. Ambient<br>
air is blown onto the glass by fans 26.<br>
        The apparatus 10 also includes gas distributors 27, 28, 29 and 30<br>
located in the float zone 11. The desired precursor mixtures for the individual<br>
coatings are supplied to the respective gas distributors, which in turn direct the<br>
precursor mixtures to the hot surface of the glass ribbon. The precursors react<br>
at the glass surface to form the desired coatings.<br>
        The coated glass article of the invention is ideally suited for use in<br>
architectural glazings. For example, the coated glass article may be utilized in<br>
an insulated glass unit. Thus, the coated glass article of the present invention<br>
is illustrated in Fig. 3 as an outboard lite 45 in an insulated glass unit 43<br>
suitable for installation into a building structure. The insulated glass unit 43<br>
also includes an inboard lite 53 made of a glass article and maintained in a<br>
spaced apart relationship from the outboard lite 45 by a frame (not shown) in<br>
the known manner. The glass substrate 45 of the present invention is<br>
positioned facing the exterior of the structure. The multilayered coating 49 of<br>
the present invention faces the interior with an air space 51 separating the<br>
outboard lite 45 from the inboard lite 53.<br>
         <br>
        When the protective overcoat is formed of fluorine doped tin oxide, the<br>
low emittance provided by the fluorine doped tin oxide improves the<br>
performance of the coated glass article in the summer and winter. The<br>
radiation energy, a component of the indirect gain from the glass to the building<br>
interior, is reduced under summer conditions with a low emittance coating.<br>
This is noticed as a reduction in the total solar heat transmittance (TSHT).<br>
TSHT is defined as including solar energy transmitted directly through the<br>
glass, and the solar energy absorbed by the glass, and subsequently<br>
convected and thermally radiated inwardly. Further, solar heat gain coefficient<br>
(SHGC) is defined as the ratio of total solar heat gain through the glass relative<br>
to the incident solar radiation. The major improvement in performance,<br>
however, occurs under winter conditions where the U-value of the glazing<br>
structure is reduced significantly with a low emittance coating. The U-value or<br>
the overall heat transfer coefficient is inversely proportional to the thermal<br>
resistance of the structure. A lower U-value means a reduction in heat loss<br>
through the glass from the interior to the exterior, resulting in savings in energy<br>
costs.<br>
        Thus, the low emittance of the coated glass article, when combined with<br>
the surprisingly selective solar absorption of the multilayer stack provides<br>
improved heat rejection in summer and heat retention in winter.<br>
        The resulting insulated glass unit, utilizing the coated glass article of the<br>
present invention, exhibits specific transmittance and spectral properties. The<br>
low emittance of surface 49 (Fig. 3) results in a U-value of less than 0.34 and<br>
preferably less than 0.32. The total solar heat transmittance of the unit is less<br>
than 41%. The insulated glass unit also exhibits a visible light transmittance<br>
(Illuminant C) of 62% or more.<br>
        The insulated glass unit preferably exhibits a neutral color in both<br>
reflectance and transmittance.<br>
        The following examples, which constitute the best mode presently<br>
contemplated for practicing the invention, are presented solely for the purpose<br>
of further Illustrating and disclosing the present invention, and are not to be<br>
construed as a limitation on the invention.<br>
         <br>
              PREDICTIVE EXAMPLES 1-15 and 16-23<br>
A float glass process is used to produce a float glass ribbon having a<br>
thickness of 6mm. During the production of the float glass ribbon, the specified<br>
coatings are modeled to be consecutively applied onto the glass substrate in<br>
the float bath through conventional chemical vapor deposition methods at the<br>
thicknesses (in Angstroms) indicated in Table 1. The precursor mixture for the<br>
various tin oxide coatings Includes dimethyl tin dichloride, oxygen, water, and<br>
helium as a carrier gas. The precursor mixture for the silicon dioxide coating<br>
includes monosilane, ethylene, and oxygen and a carrier gas. The precursor<br>
mixture for the doped zinc oxide includes a Zn precursor such as diethyl zinc<br>
(DEZ), an oxygen source such as IPA (isopropanol), and a suitable aluminum<br>
precursor, for example, diethylaluminum chloride. Alternatively, a suitable<br>
gallium precursor could be substituted for the aluminum precursor. The<br>
resulting doped zinc oxide layer has a dopant concentration of about 2 atomic<br>
percent Al or Ga.<br>
        The visible light transmittance (TVis), total solar energy transmittance<br>
(Tsol) and the solar selectivity (Tvis - Tsal) were calculated for the resulting<br>
coated glass article in each example. Tvis and TSOl, for the noted examples, are<br>
for a monolithic glazing, i.e., a single glass sheet. The results are also shown<br>
in Table I.<br>
         <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        Examples 16-23 were modeled on much the same basis as Examples 1-<br>
15. except that Examples 16-23 represent an Insulated glass unit, as elsewhere<br>
defined herein, formed from two sheets of glass. The inventive coating stack<br>
was projected to be located on the so-called #2 surface; that is, on the major<br>
surface of the outboard glass sheet which faces the air space between the two<br>
glass sheets. The gap between the glass sheets was 12mm, and the space<br>
was filled with air.<br>
        The electrical and optical properties of conductive materials can be<br>
characterized by NB, the concentration of free electrons in the material, and µ,<br>
the mobility of free electrons in the material. The solar selectivity of the coating<br>
stacks described herein depends primarily on the concentration of free<br>
electrons in the doped ZnO layer. As shown by Examples 2-4 in Table 1, the<br>
required solar selectivity can be achieved by using highly doped zinc oxide,<br>
where "highly-doped" refers to an electron concentration greater than 1.0 x 1021<br>
electrons/cm3. By comparison, Example 1 shows that doped ZnO having an<br>
electron concentration of only 1.0 x 1021 electrons/cm3 results in a TviS (69%)<br>
that just meets the target value (&gt;69%). The solar selectivity of the coating<br>
stacks described herein also depends on the electron mobility in the doped<br>
ZnO layer. As shown by Examples 3 and 6-8 in Table 1, the required solar<br>
selectivity can be achieved by using highly doped zinc oxide with an electron<br>
mobility in the range of 15-100 cm2N-s. By way of comparison. Example 5<br>
shows that doped ZnO with an electron mobility of 10 results in a Tvis (69%) that<br>
just meets the target value (269%).<br>
        Examples 9 and 10 demonstrate that a thin protective overcoat, on the<br>
order of 200-300A of, for example SnO2 or SiO2, does not substantially alter the<br>
solar performance of the film stack. Tvis and TSOl remain above the desired<br>
levels of 69% and only slightly greater than 40%, respectively.<br>
        Example 11 demonstrates that a thicker doped overcoat (3000A fluorine<br>
doped tin oxide) does not seem to adversely affect the solar performance of the<br>
film stack, as both TviS and Tsol are within the targeted levels of &gt; 69% and<br>

type modeled in Example 11 may provide lower emissivity and more nearly<br>
neutral color.<br>
         <br>
        Example 12 shows that undertayers beside SiO2, for example SnO2,<br>
may be utilized in the subject film stack while maintaining desired levels of Tvis<br>
and Tsol. Examples 13-15 show utilization of optional multi-layer color<br>
suppression interlayers which provide desired neutral color of transmitted light<br>
while, once again, maintaining desired levels of Tvis and Tsol.<br>
        Table 2 shows the results of modeling of Insulated glass (IG) units, the<br>
structure of which has been previously described herein. The solar<br>
performance of the subject IG units consistently exhibit properties at, or above,<br>
desired levels, in particular, Tvis &gt;62%, solar heat gain coefficient (SHGC)<br>
&gt;0.40 and U-value 
of the doped zinc oxide coating. Emissivity is also, generally, less than 0.2,<br>
and for some examples, 
<br>
<br>
             PREDICTIVE EXAMPLES 24-31 and 32-35<br>
Examples 24-31, as shown in Table 3. were modeled utilizing Input<br>
parameters substantially similar to Examples 1-15. The substrate thickness<br>
was 3mm rather than 6mm, however.<br>
Similarly, Examples 32-35 were modeled as IG units substantially similar<br>
to those modeled In Examples 16-23. The thickness of both sheets of glass<br>
was, however, 3mm and the gap therebetween was 6mm, rather than 12mm.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
        As can be observed from reviewing Table 3, with silmilar thicknesses of<br>
highly doped zinc oxide on thinner glass, it is still possible to maintain a Tsol of<br>
40, and a solar selectivity &gt;28, although the preferred solar selectivity of 33 is<br>
more difficult to achieve.<br>
        Examples 32-35, displayed in Table 4, demonstrate that it is also<br>
possible to meet the desired solar performance levels for an IG unit utilizing<br>
3mm glass, namely Tvis &gt;62, SHGC &gt;0.40 and U-value 
        In accordance with the provisions of the patent statutes, the present<br>
invention has been described in what is considered to represent its preferred<br>
embodiment. However, it should be noted that the invention can be practiced<br>
otherwise than as specifically illustrated and described without departing from<br>
its spirit and scope. For example, other coating methods, such as sputtering,<br>
may also be utilized to form the solar control coating of the present invention.<br>
