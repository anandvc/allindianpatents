				<td>Field of the Invention	<br><br>
This invention relates to An apparates for sealing on an air handling unit <br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Some air handling units in current use are equipped with an open structural framework and the openings in the framework are closed by panels that seal against the structural elements forming the opening. Adhesive backed gaskets are placed about the inside perimeter of the panel which, when brought into pressure contact with the structural elements, form a seal to prevent air from passing out of the unit around the panel. The gaskets are difficult to install involving a good deal of cutting and fitting which, in turn, generates a good deal of scrap material, hi addition, it is oftentimes extremely difficult to achieve the uniform pressure needed to produce a seal and, as a result, leaks in the unit occur. Over time, the panels may be repeatably removed and replaced weakening or damaging the adhesive material again producing leaks in the unit and eventual replacement of the gaskets.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to improve air handling units.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to improve panel seals utilized in air handling units.<br>
A still further object of the present invention is to provide a panel seal for an air handling unit that can be quickly installed in the unit.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a panel seal for an air handling unit that allows the panel to be repeatedly removed and reinstalled without jeopardizing the seal"s integrity.<br>
These and other objects of the present invention are obtained by a seal assembly suitable for use in an air handling unit having co-joined modular sections. Each section contams a framework having rectangular shaped openings. The<br>
openings are closed by means of panels that are locked into the openings by means of a series of latching mechanisms. The structural elements forming each rectangular shaped opening are each equipped with a guide rail for slidably receiving a seal assembly thereon. Each assembly, in turn, includes a pair of resilient bulb seals that are coextruded along opposed side edges of a stiff or rigid support plate that is arranged to engage a guide rail in sliding contact. The structural elements forming the opening are brought together by comer pieces. The comer pieces have slots formed therein for receiving the ends of the rigid support plates that surround the opening. The bulb seals in assembly pass outside the slots and are brought into contact with each other at the comers so that the seals encircle the opening perimeter so that when a panel is latched into the opening, the panel will compress the seals and provide a leak tight joint between the stmctural elements.<br>
Typically, the openings in the framework are perpendicularly aligned with each other. The guide rails are mounted on stractural elements that are commonly shared by two adjacent openings so that the bulb seal miming along one edge of the support plate serves to seal one of the adjacent openings while the other bulb seal serves to seal the other adjacent opening.<br><br>
To meet the aforementioned objections, the invention provides for an air handling unit containing modular sections, each section having a framework with perpendicularly aligned rectangular shaped openings therein that are closed by close fitting panels that are latched into said openings, japparatus for sealing said panels in said openings that comprises :<br>
tubular structural elements mounted about each panel opening so that each panel opening shares a common structural element with an adjacent perpendicularly aligned panel opening,<br>
said common structural elements each containing a rail extending along said element,<br>
a seal assembly mounted upon said rail that includes a rigid elongated plate having bulb seals mounted along opposing edges of said plate so that the bulb seal extending along one edge of the plate is capable of sealing against a first panel contained in one of the adjacent panel openings and the seal extending along the other edge is capable of sealing against a second panel contained in an adjacent panel opening.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Turning initially to Fig. 1 there is shown a portion of an air handling unit, generally referenced 10. that embodies the teachings of the present invention. The unit contains a series of rectangular shaped modular sections each of which includes a framework having a series of openings 11 that are closed by specially prepared panels 12 that act as a thermal barrier to impede the transfer of heat between the interior of the unit and the surrounding ambient. Although the panels provide an excellent thermal barrier to the flow of heat, air can move between the panels and the framework defining the openings thus defeating the integrity of the thermal barrier provided by the panels. As will be explained in further detail below, the present invention involves seals that are supported upon structural elements and are arranged to close against the entire periphery of each panein assembly to provide a fiirther thermal barrier, as well as preventing air from moving between the panels and the framework of the unit.<br>
As further illustrated in Figs. 2-7, the framework includes individual modular sections_that are brought together in assembly to form an enclosed flow path for conducting conditioned air or the like along a desired path of travel. Each modular section of the unit includes a pair of opposed end frames 14 and 15 that are       connected by horizontal square tubular beams which include two upper beams 17 and two lower beams 18. Each end frame further includes a pair of square tubular side rails 20 and 21. upper rail 23 and an opposed lower rail 24. The rails and beams of each section are interconnected by means of comer pieces 25. Each comer piece.<br>
in tiim, contains a central hub 26 and three perpendicularly disposed arms 27-29 that emanate from the hub. Two of the arms 27 and 28 (Fig. 7) are contained in a common horizontal plane and a third arm 29 is contained in a vertical plane. Although not shown, the distal end of each arm is necked down and is slidably received inside of one of the hollow tubular structural elements that are connected to the end pieces. Each modular section thus contains four adjacent perpendicularly aligned openings that each share a common structural element with its neighbor.<br>
The structural elements of the unit framework are fabricated of metal which, as in the case of most metals, has a relatively high thermal conductivity. The comer pieces on the other hand are fabricated of a high strength plastic material having a relatively low thermal conductivity, that is, a conductivity that is far less than that of the metal members. The conductivity of the comer pieces, like the panels, is such that the comer pieces act as a thermal barrier to the passage of heat.<br>
Each of the tubular stmctural elements contains a pair of outwardly extended flat flanges 30 and 31 that coact as guide rails that nm along an inside comer edge 32 of each commonly shared stmcnural element. The height of the two flanges are about equal and each flange contains a proximal edge with the edges meeting at the inside comer of the commonly shared element. The two flanges in assembly form a right angle with respect to each other.<br>
As best see in Fig. a seal assembly generally referenced 35 is slidably<br>
mounted upon the extended outer edges of the two perpendicular flanges. The assembly includes a rigid plate 37 having inwardly turned edges 38 and 39 that are arranged to hook over the outer edges of the flanges to slidably secure the assembly to the flanges. Bulb shaped seals 40 and 41 are carried upon the side edges of the plate and extend along the entire length of the plate. The seals and the plate are coextruded from materials having different durometers The plate is formed of a relatively stiff material that will hold its shape while the bulb seals are formed of a resilient material. As illustrated in Fig. 3. the bulb seals can be readily compressed to conform to the shape of a compressing body such as one of the frame panels 12 to form a positive seal thereagainst.<br><br>
As illustrated in Fig. 7, both ends of the seal supporting plates are received in openings 43 formed in the hub of each comer piece so that the body section of the plate is telescoped into the opening. Slots 45 are cut into the side walls of the openings to allow the two opposed seals to pass outside of each opening.<br>
As can be seen from the drawings, three seal assemblies come together at each comer piece. The ends 48 of the seals contained in each assembly are mitered at a 45° angle so that the ends of the seals come together in each comer piece to form a leak tight joint therebetween. As should be now evident, four seals extend about the perimeter of each opening in the frame. When a panel is inserted into the opening as illustrated in Fig. 3, the four seals are compressed by the inner siuiace of the panel to completely seal the opening. Each panel has an inwardly directed recess 50 formed in its side walls that surround the entire panel. A series of latching mechanisms 53 are mounted inside of the structural elements surround each opening. Each latching mechanism includes a cylindrical rotor 54 that is rotatably mounted in a trunnion 55 secured in a supporting structural element. A latching arm 56 is secured to the free end of the rotor. The arm is capable of being turned by the rotor between a first recessed position as shown in Fig. 2 wherein the arm is located inside the structural element and a locking position as shown in Fig. 3 wherein the arm is in contact with a side wall of the recess surrounding the panel to hold the panel in tight sealing contact with the bulb seals surrounding the panel opening.<br>
With all the panels locked in place, the air inside the unit sees only the seals, the comer pieces and the inside wall of the panels. All of these three components have a very low thermal conductivity, that is a thermal conductivity less than the metal beam and rail members. Accprdingly,.there is.no conductive path extending between the interior of the air handling unit and the surrounding ambient that would permit heat to be readily transferred through the walls of the unit. This, in tum. prevents moisture from building up on the outside walls of the unit and provide for more effective conduction of conditioned air through the unit.<br>
While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to the preferred mode as illustrated in the drawing, it will be understood by one skilled in the art that various changes in detail may be effected therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
