THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
TITLE<br>
Conversion of organic waste to smaller hydrocarbons<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and a device for conversion of organic waste, in particular chopped waste plastics. The present method constitutes a process of liquefying waste, which takes place in the presence of inorganic medium, e.g. combination of silicates with Zeolites and transition metal particles. The process of cracking of waste is carried out in order to obtain a mixture of hydrocarbons in the liquid form, which could be utilized as liquid fuels or for the production of liquid fuels.<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Zeolite is an inorganic porous material having a highly regular structure of pores and chambers that allows some molecules to pass through, and causes others to be either excluded, or broken down. It is in many ways, the inorganic equivalent of organic enzymes, many of which also have specific sized chambers that trap chemicals within our bodies, holding them where they either break down, or react with specific chemicals. What Zeolite does, and how it does it, depends upon the exact shape, size, and charge distribution of the lattice structure of the Zeolites. There are hundreds of different Zeolites found in nature and made by man.<br>
A defining feature of Zeolites is that their frameworks are made up of 4-connected networks of atoms. One way of thinking about this is in terms of tetrahedra, with a silicon atom in the middle and oxygen atoms at the corners. These tetrahedra can then link together by their corners (see illustration) to from a rich variety of beautiful structures. The framework structure may contain linked cages, cavities or channels, which are of the<br><br>
right size to allow small molecules to enter - i.e. the limiting pore sizes<br>
are roughly between 3 and 10 A in diameter.<br>
In all, over 130 different framework structures are now known. In addition<br>
to having silicon or aluminum as the tetrahedral atom, other compositions<br>
have also been synthesized,  including the growing  category of micro<br>
porous aluminophosphates, known as ALPOs.<br>
Catalysis:<br>
Zeolites have the ability to act as catalysts for chemical reactions which<br>
take place within the internal cavities. An important class of reactions is<br>
that catalyzed by hydrogen-exchanged Zeolites, whose framework-bound<br>
protons give rise to very high acidity. This is exploited in many organic<br>
reactions, including crude oil cracking, isomerisation and fuel synthesis.<br>
Zeolites can also serve as oxidation or reduction catalysts, often after<br>
metals have been introduced into the framework. Examples are the use of<br>
titanium ZSM-5 in the production of caprolactam, and copper Zeolites in<br>
NOx decomposition.<br>
Underpinning all these types of reaction is the unique micro porous nature<br>
of Zeolites, where the shape and size of a particular pore system exerts a<br>
stearic influence on the reaction, controlling the access of reactants and<br>
products. Thus Zeolites are often said to act as shape-selective catalysts.<br>
Increasingly, attention has focused on fine-tuning the properties of Zeolite<br>
catalysts  in  order to carry out very specific syntheses of high-value<br>
chemicals e.g. Pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.<br>
Adsorption and Separation<br>
The shape-selective properties of Zeolites are also the basis for their use<br>
in   molecular  adsorption.   The  ability   preferentially  to   adsorb  certain<br>
molecules,   while  excluding  others,   has  opened   up  a   wide   range  of<br>
molecular sieving applications. Sometimes it is simply a matter of the size<br>
and shape of pores controlling access into the Zeolite.  In other cases<br>
different types of molecule enter the Zeolite, but some diffuse through the<br>
channels more quickly, leaving others stuck behind, as in the purification<br>
of Para Xylene by silicate.<br>
Cation-containihg Zeolites are extensively used as desiccants due to their<br>
high affinity for water, and also find application in gas separation, where<br>
molecules are differentiated on the basis of their electrostatic interactions<br><br>
with the metal ions. Conversely, hydrophobic silica Zeolites preferentially absorbs organic solvents. Zeolites can thus separate molecules based on differences of size, shape and polarity. Mechanism of pyroiysis<br>
1.	End Chain cracking: The polymer is broken up from the end group<br>
successively yielding the corresponding monomer.<br>
2.	Random   chain   cracking:   The   polymer   chain   is   broken   up<br>
randomly into fragments of uneven length.<br>
3.	Chain stripping: Elimination of reactive substitutes or side groups<br>
on the polymer chain leading to evolution of a cracking product on<br>
one hand and charring polymer chain on the other.<br>
4.	Cross linking: Formation of a chain network which often occurs for<br>
thermosetting polymer when heated.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
International patent WO95/06682 disclosed a method of utilization of plastics, which proposes to supply a mixture of plastics, mainly polyolefin type, by means of an extruder, to a reactor, at heightened temperature and in the presence of a catalyst suitable for catalytic cracking. The de-polymerization product undergoes a fractioning into fractions of diesel fuel and gasoline. The total efficiency reaches 70% in relation to raw materials introduced into the process.<br>
US patent 3,770,419 discloses a pyroiysis process for recycling of organic and non-organic refuse including metals, which comprises feeding the refuse into a closed retort having a molten metal bath, submerging the refuse in said bath, collecting vapors, separating any remaining solid residue from the molten metals, conveying the solid residue out of the retort and collecting some molten metals by skimming and conveying skimmed molten metals out of the retort.<br>
US patent 1,658,143 discloses an apparatus for distillation of oil shale comprising a distillation chamber having a corrugated floor, a burner beneath the floor, a series of drums extending across and rotatably mounted within the chamber, a conveyor at the discharge end of the bath<br><br>
reaching into the gangue receiving chamber and the means for introducing raw shale material into the distillation chamber.<br>
European patent application EP 0395486 discloses a method for continuous thermal conversion of organic waste, in the form of contaminated waste plastics and worn out vehicle tyres, to the gas-vapour mixture form, in which the charge in closed perforated box containers is introduced into a hot bath, preferably molten lead bath, by means of a conveyer. After transferring the box containers with the charge through the melting zone and the decomposition zone, by means of the same conveyer, the containers with the remaining impurities are removed from the bath, wherein the gaseous products of decomposition are collected through a circular top aperture. The device disclosed in this publication comprises a casing, including a vat and a conical head, a heating system comprising only a multitude of heating pipes surrounding the containers transported on the conveyer, an endless conveyer surrounding the bottom of the vat and constituting, at the same time, the loading device, the charge moving device and the impurities removal device. There is also a product collecting pipeline for collecting the gaseous product by means of a vertical pipe placed in the circular top aperture of the conical head.<br>
The method and device described in the patent mentioned above, are particularly difficult and expensive, in an industrial scale execution, owing to the huge, reaching tens of tons, weight of the molten lead bath as well as the complex system for the charge loading and transporting in closed containers, by means of a single conveyer surrounding the bottom of the vat and also is complicated, and less effective. Heating system will require a separate bath agitating device to agitate such a big volume of the bath.<br>
Indian patent application 102/MUM/2001 and 535/MUM/2001 discloses an improved process and an apparatus to convert waste plastic into value added products like liquid fuels, coke and petroleum gases consisting of a cylindrical /rectangular coking vessel made from stainless steel heated up to 600 °C connected to condenser, the other end of the condenser is connected to the receiving section to collect the distillate in batches or<br><br>
continuously using Alumina or Benzoquinon in the range of 0.001% to 5.0%.<br>
In particular, these methods and devices do not present an opportunity to apply a catalyst to improve the process and increase its efficiency as well as the quality of the final product.<br>
This process lacks the means to control the displacement and the temperature of the liquid fraction formed while melted charge leaves the containers and undergoes the transformation into the gaseous fraction, whereas it may also form a liquid surface layer, depending on the character    of    the    charge    and    the    temperature    of    the    bath.<br>
Additionally, an apparatus according to the US patent 1, 658,143 and a process according to the US patent 3,770, 419 apart from disadvantages of the system described in EP 0 395 486 stemming from the application of the molten lead and complicated construction has disadvantages resulting from the phenomenon of "fouling" by lead, in which moving steel elements (paddles) in contact with lead are covered by this metal because of its low thermal conductivity. Besides applied means for introduction of charge in the form of screw conveyors require very precise comminuting of the charge, whereas means to remove any remaining solid residue are easily blocked by solidifying lead.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, the catalyst is charged into a pyrolysis hot bath. Waste plastic is charged into the sealed pyrolysis reactor, and it is directly mixed with the hot catalyst to perform a reaction of pyrolysis and catalytic cracking in absence of oxygen. The materials are decomposed into gaseous hydrocarbons and residues. Gaseous substances from the reaction are collected by means of the conventional methods as described in the prior arts so as to obtain lower hydrocarbons (gasoline, diesel and the like).<br>
In the above-mentioned process, the feedstock is mixed directly with<br>
catalyst, where pyrolysis and the catalytic cracking takes place at the<br>
same	time.<br>
Said catalyst is made as follows: 10 - 80 % Silicate, 0-45 % Zeolite, 0 -10 % transition metals, 0-25 % metal oxides, 0-10 % metal carbonates and 0-50 % fuller's earth.<br>
Catalyst is charged into pyrolysis reactor heated to 350 °C continuously with a hot bath. The materials are mixed directly with the catalyst in the reactor to undergo a pyrolytic reaction and a catalytic cracking. Gaseous hydrocarbons generated from the reaction move forward to enter a condenser maintained at lower temperature with the help of cold water.<br><br>
Gaseous hydrocarbons with small molecules may be fractionated in a fractional column to obtain gasoline, kerosene, diesel, lubricant oil and heavy oil by means of a conventional process.<br>
The reaction of pyrolysis and catalytic cracking is conducted under vacuum, and the temperature of the catalyst is controlled at 300 - 400 °C, preferably at 375 °C.<br>
The charge is in the form of all types of waste plastics. The technological process is described, in examples, for waste polyolefin plastics. The plastics are delivered in the form of bales and rolls and they are stored in a warehouse. The bales undergo pre-cutting or could be loosened. The charge of waste plastics is fed in portions of 0.50 kg. The compressed portion of plastics is then introduced into the reactor vessel, containing catalyst mixture. In the presence of the catalyst and under the influence of temperature, the process of bond cleavage takes place in the polymers components of the charge. In the decomposition of the polyolefin waste, the mixture of hydrocarbons from methane CH4 to C30H62 is obtained. At the process temperature of 300 - 400 °C the decomposition products comprises of the gas/vapour phase. The vapours formed on catalytic cracking are condensed through a condenser and the liquid is collected in a separate container through a receiving tank. Catalytic cracking delivers to a wide range of products that are subjected to subsequent separations at different temperatures. Faster heating leads to more gases whereas slow and steady heat increases the yield of liquids.<br>
Catalyst can be reused 1 to 2 times. Spent catalyst can be removed from sludge by gravity and washing.<br>
Following catalysts are used<br>
1. Silicates: 10 to 85 % Silicates help in breaking / cleavage of higher hydrocarbons to lower hydrocarbons. Silicates have more surface area available for hydrocarbons cracking because of porosity.<br><br>
2.	Zeolite: 0 to 45 % Zeolites help in breaking / cleavage of higher<br>
hydrocarbons to lower hydrocarbons. Zeolites have more surface<br>
area available for hydrocarbons cracking.<br>
3.	Metal Oxides:  0 to 25 % Metal Oxides are good for side chain<br>
cleavage   and   random   cleavage   resulting   in   large   number   of<br>
monomer molecules.<br>
4.	Metal carbonates: 0 to 10 % Metal carbonates are good for side<br>
chain cleavage resulting in large number of monomer molecules.<br>
5.	Metal carbide: 0 to 10 % Silicone carbide is good for side chain<br>
cleavage resulting in large number of monomer molecules.<br>
6.	Charcoal: 0 to 40 %. Charcoal helps in decolourisation.<br>
7.	Fuller's earth: 0 to 50 % Fuller's earth helps in decolourisation and<br>
deodorisation.<br>
Total quantity of the catalyst to be used is 2 to 10 % of the total mass of the reactants in the reactor. As the quantity of catalyst is increased with the proportion of the total mass, the total reaction time is reduced and the yield is more. As the temperature of the reaction is increased the yield percentage is more. However the temperature should not exceed 400 °C as more of gases will be produced resulting in the reduction of liquid fuel yield.<br>
Total time for the completion of reaction ranges from 1.5 to 3 hours, which is visibly indicated by stopping of liquids being collected in the receiver vessel.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Random depolymerisation of the plastic materials gives<br>
1.	Liquid fuel: 80 - 85 % Mixture of gasoline, diesel, kerosene and<br>
lube oil.<br>
2.	Gaseous fuel: 5 to 10 %.<br>
3.	Solid fuel: 2-10 % coke.<br>
All types of plastic waste like Polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene terpthalate, ABS, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chloride, hospital waste and the like can be used to produce liquid fuel. About 1 kg of plastic waste gives about 1.1 litre of liquid fuel with density 0.725 to 0.8 along with by products of gas and coke.<br>
While using PVC waste Dioxin formation is ruled out because the reaction is carried out in the absence of oxygen (under vacuum), which is the prime requirement for Dioxin formation. Chlorine produced is removed by scrubbing the gases in water.<br>
Unsaturated hydrocarbons can be treated with H2 in the presence of platinum to get saturated hydrocarbons.<br>
Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the invention, a process and a device that fully satisfies the objects, aims, and advantages set forth above. While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br><br>
The catalytic decomposition was performed in hot bath, usually at temperatures between 250 and 400 degree C.<br>
A laboratory setup was used for preliminary experimentation which consisted of a thermally regulated flask with water condenser. The flask temperature was regulated to within 350 degree C and the overhead distillate condensed with 30 degree C water.<br>
The range of temperatures was 250 to 400 degree C for most plastics and the   reaction   time   varied   up   to   3   hour   in   30   minute   increments.<br>
The important individual results which varied with the type of plastic were as follows:<br>
PE: With 5 % catalyst and 95 % PE starting and a 90 - 120 minute operating time, little overhead distillate was condensed below 15 degree. C but here 82 % of the total product mix was overhead distillate. At 365 degree C 82 % was distillate indicates 82 % process efficiency. Heavy oil containing some decomposition products remained in the flask. For all temperatures small amount of coke was produced and the overhead gas was less than 10 %. For the time varying experimentation at 365 degree C, the overhead distillate increased with time peaking at 82 % at one hour. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry detailed study of the 350 degree C overhead distillate indicated over 15 organic compounds and the 48 % majority was classified as a mixture of C7 to Cu substituted carbon compounds.<br>
Example 2<br>
PP: With 10 % catalyst and 90 % PP starting and a 90 - 180 minute operating time, little overhead distillate was condensed below 25 degree C but here 85 % of the total product mix was overhead distillate. At 385 degree C 85 % was distillate indicates 85 % process efficiency. Heavy oil containing some decomposition products remained in the flask. For all temperatures small amount of coke was produced and the overhead gas<br><br>
was less than 10 %. For the time varying experimentation at 385 degree C, the overhead distillate increased with time peaking at 83 % at one hour. A gas chromatography / mass spectrometry detailed study of the 385 degree C overhead distillate indicated over 15 organic compounds and the 48 % majority was classified as a mixture of C7 to Cu substituted carbon compounds.<br>
Example 3<br>
PVC: With 10 % catalyst and 90 % PVC starting and a 90 - 150 minute operating time, little overhead distillate was condensed below 15 degree C but here 78 % of the total product mix was overhead distillate. At 325 degree C 85 % was distillate indicates 85 % process efficiency. Heavy oil containing some decomposition products remained in the flask. For all temperatures small measurable coke was produced and the overhead gas was less than 8 %. For the time varying experimentation at 360 degree C, the overhead distillate increased with time peaking at 83 % at one hour. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry detailed study of the 360 degree C overhead distillate indicated over 15 organic compounds and the 45 % majority was classified as a mixture of C7 to Cu substituted carbon compounds.<br>
Example 4<br>
PET: With 8 % catalyst and 92 % PET starting and a 90 - 180 minute operating time, little overhead distillate was condensed below 15 degree. C but here 90 % of the total product mix was overhead distillate. At 385 degree C 90 % was distillate indicates 90 % process efficiency. Heavy oil containing some decomposition products remained in the flask. For all temperatures small amount of coke was produced and the overhead gas was less than 10 %. For the time varying experimentation at 385 degree C, the overhead distillate increased with time peaking at 83 % at one hour. A gas chromatography/mass spectrometry detailed study of the 385 degree C overhead distillate indicated over 15 organic compounds and the 48 % majority was classified as a mixture of C7 to C11 substituted carbon compounds.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
With 2 to 4 % of metal silicates and metal oxides (1: 0.25) and 2 to 5 % of Fullers Earth and lkg of plastic as starting material and a 90 - 180 minute operating time, little overhead distillate was condensed below 15 degree. C but here 85 % of the total product mix was overhead distillate. At 375 degree C 85 % was distillate indicates 85 % process efficiency. Heavy oil containing some decomposition products remained in the flask. For all temperatures 5 to 10 % coke was produced and the overhead gas was less than 10 %. For the time varying experimentation at 350 to 400 degree C, the overhead distillate increased with time peaking at 83 % at one hour. A detailed study of the 375 degree C overhead distillate indicated yields as below.<br>
Liquid hydrocarbons    80 to 90 %<br>
Gas	5 to 15 %<br>
Solid coke	2 to 10 %<br>
Example 6<br>
With 2 % of metal silicates and metal (1: 0.25) and 2 to 4 % of Fullers Earth and lkg of plastic as starting material and a 90 - 180 minute operating time, little overhead distillate was condensed below 25 degree. C but here 85 % of the total product mix was overhead distillate. At 375 degree C 85 % was distillate indicates 85 % process efficiency. Heavy oil containing some decomposition products remained in the flask. For all temperatures 5 to 10 % coke was produced and the overhead gas was less than 10 %. For the time varying experimentation at 375 to 400 degree C, the overhead distillate increased with time peaking at 86 % at one hour. A detailed study of the 375 degree C overhead distillate indicated yields as below.<br>
Yield:<br>
Liquid hydrocarbons	: 75 to 85%<br>
Gas - LPG type	5 to 10 %<br>
Solid coke	5 to 15 %<br><br>
Calorific Value of Liquid hydrocarbons    :   ~ 11000 KCal/ Kg<br>
