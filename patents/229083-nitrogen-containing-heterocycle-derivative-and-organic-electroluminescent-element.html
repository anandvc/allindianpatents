DESCRIPTION<br>
NITROGEN-CONTAINING HETEROCYCLE DERIVATIVE AND ORGANIC ELECTROLUMINESCENT ELEMENT USING THE SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel nitrogen-containing heterocycle derivative, i.e., a novel derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom and to an organic electroluminescent element (an electroluminescent element will be referred to as an electroluminescence device, hereinafter) which utilizes the novel compound. More particularly, the present invention relates to a derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom useful as constituting component of an organic electroluminescence ("electroluminescence1* will be occasionally referred to as "EL", hereinafter) device, i.e., an organic EL device achieving elevation of luminance and of efficiency in light emission even under low driving voltage in accordance with an employment of the derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom for at least one layer composing organic compound layers of the EL device.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Organic EL devices which utilize organic substances are expected to be useful for application as an inexpensive full color display device of the solid light emission type having a great size and various developments on the organic EL devices are being conducted. In general, an organic EL device has a construction comprising a light emitting layer and a pair of<br><br>
electrodes sandwiching the light emitting layer. The light emission of the organic EL device is a phenomenon in which, when an electric field is applied between the two electrodes, electrons are injected from the cathode side and holes are injected from the anode side, the electrons are recombined with the holes in the light emitting layer to form an excited state, and energy generated when the excited state returns to the ground state is emitted as light.<br>
As compared with an inorganic light emitting diode, conventional organic EL devices requires high driving voltage and only exhibited low luminance or low efficiency of light emission. Moreover, characteristic degradation of the conventional organic EL devices was also extravagant and as a result, they were not practically used. Although recent organic EL devices are improved step by steps, it has been still demanded to develop organic EL devices operable at low driving voltage, with excellent luminance and favorable efficiency of light emission.<br>
Resolving the above problems, for example, United States Patent No. 5,645,948 discloses an organic EL device with the use of a compound having benzimidazole structure as an light emitting material describing that the organic EL device emits light with a luminance of 200 nit at a voltage of 9 V. Further, Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2002-38141 discloses a compound having benzimidazole ring and anthracene skeleton. However, an organic EL device with further enhanced luminance and with further improved efficiency of light emission than the organic EL device with the use of the above compounds -     is required.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom useful as a constitutional component of an organic EL device. Another object of the present invention is to provide an organic EL device achieving elevation of luminance and of efficiency in light emission in accordance with an employment of the derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom for at least one layer composing organic compound layers of the EL device. As a result of intensive researches and studies to achieve the above object by the present inventors, a derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom was found to be a novel compound with specific structure useful as a material for an organic El device. Further, employing the compound as a component of at least one layer (in particular, electron injecting layer) in organic compound layers of an organic EL device was also found enabling to achieve elevation of luminance and of efficiency in light emission. Such being the case, the present invention has been accomplished on the basis of the foregoing findings and information.<br>

In this case, the light emitting layer corresponds to the light emitting zone. Further, explanations about the light emitting layer, the electron transporting layer and the electron injecting material will be described<br><br>
below.<br>
Following is a description regarding a device structure about the organic EL device of the present invention.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention comprises at least one of organic compound layers containing a light emitting layer sandwiched between a pair of electrodes, wherein the organic compound layers comprises at least one layer containing a derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom represented by any one of general formulae (I), (II) and (III) of the present invention.<br>
Typical examples of the construction of the organic EL device of the present invention include *<br>
anode / hole injecting layer / light emitting layer / electron injecting layer / cathode type;<br>
anode / light emitting layer / electron injectiig layer / cathode type? anode / hole injecting layer / light emitting layer / cathode type! and anode / light emitting layer / cathode type.<br>
However, the construction of the organic EL device is not limited to those described above as the examples.<br>
It is preferable for the organic EL device of the present invention to employ the compound of the present invention as a constituting material for the light emitting layer and/or the electron injecting layer. Although the hole injecting layer or the electron injecting layer is not always necessary for the device structure, an organic EL device having these layers has an advantage of improving light emitting property. Further, the hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer   may   be   mixedly   sandwiched   between   a   pair   of   electrodes.<br><br>
Furthermore, a mixed layer may be made with the use of a binder such as a high molecular compound in order that each constituting component exists stably.<br>
An explanation about an organic EL device of anode / hole injecting layer / light emitting layer / electron injecting layer / cathode type example of the present invention will be described hereinunder. In general, the organic EL device is produced on a substrate which transmits light. The substrate which transmits light is the substrate which supports the organic EL device. As the substrate which transmits light, for example, glass sheet, synthetic resin sheet and quartzes are advantageously employed.<br>
As the anode, an electrode made of a material such as a metal, an alloy, a conductive compound and a mixture of these materials which has a great work function (4 eV or more) is preferable. Specific examples of the material for the anode include metals such as Au and conductive materials such as Cul, ITO (indium tin oxide), Sn(&gt;2, ZnO and In-Zn-O. The anode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the electrode material described above in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process and the sputtering process. When the light emitted from the light emitting layer is obtained through the anode, it is preferable that the anode has a transmittance of the emitted light greater than 10 %. It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the anode is several hundred Q  / □ or smaller. The thickness of the anode is, in general, selected in<br>
the range of from 10 nm to 1 m and preferably in the range of from 10 to 200 nm although the preferable range may be different depending on the adopted material.<br><br>
As the cathode, an electrode made of a material such as a metal, an alloy, a conductive compound and a mixture of these materials which has a small work function (4 eV or smaller) is employed. Specific examples of the material for the cathode include sodium, sodium-potassium alloys, magnesium, magnesium-silver alloys, lithium, magnesium/copper mixture, magnesium-indium alloys, AI/AI2O3, indium, aluminum-lithium alloys, etc. The cathode can be prepared by forming a thin film of the electrode material described above in accordance with a process such as the vapor deposition process and the sputtering process. It is also preferable that the sheet resistivity of the cathode is several hundred Q/ D or smaller. The thickness of the cathode is, in general, selected in the range of from 10 nm to 500 nm and preferably in the range of from 50 to 200 nm. Additionally, it is convenient that either the anode or the cathode of the organic EL device is transparent or translucent in order to transmit light because an efficiency of light emission improves.<br>
It is preferable to employ the foregoing compound of the present invention as the light emitting material composing the light emitting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention. In the case where the compound of the present invention is employed as the light emitting material, the compound may be used alone or in combination with any of publicly known light emitting materials. In the case where the compound of the present invention is employed for other than the light emitting layer, the light emitting material in the light emitting layer is not particularly restricted but may be selectively employed in option from among the conventional well known light emitting materials. For example, polycyclic condensed aromatics, fluorescent whitening agents  such as<br><br>
benzoxazole base, benzthiazole base, benzimidazole base or so, and compounds having favorable thin film formation property such as metal chelated oxanoid compound, distyrylbenzene-based compound and so on are employed as the light emitting material. Examples of the polycyclic condensed aromatics include condensed ring light emitting substances containing anthracene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, chrysene and perylene backbone structure, other condensed ring light emitting substances containing about 8 condensed rings, etc. Specifically, 1,1,4,4-tetraphenyM ,3-butadiene, 4,4!-(2,2-diphenyl vinyl) biphenyl and so on are employable as the light emitting material. The light emitting layer may be composed of single layer comprising one or more kind of these light emitting materials or may be laminated with a light emitting layer comprising another kind of compound.<br>
A hole injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention consists of a hole transfer compound, and is capable of transferring hole which is injected from the anode to the light emitting layer. By intervening the hole injecting layer between the anode and the light emitting layer, large numbers of holes are injected into the light emitting layer even though a relatively lower electric field is applied. Moreover, because electrons injected into the light emitting layer from the cathode or the electron injecting layer are, with the influence of an electronic barrier existing on interfacial area between the light emitting layer and the hole injecting layer, a superior organic EL device with favorable light emitting property such as improving an efficiency of light emission can be obtained. The hole transfer compound used for such a hole injecting layer which is deployed between the two electrodes is<br><br>
capable of transferring holes adequately into the light emitting layer when the holes are injected from the anode. A compound which exhibits, for example, a mobility of holes of at least 10'6 cmW • second under<br>
application of an electric field of from 104 to 106 V/cm is preferable as the hole transfer compound. With regard to the hole transfer compound, it is not particularly specified as long as it has the above favorable light emitting property. Namely, any compound may be selectively employed as the hole transfer compound from among compounds such as used in custom as charge injection and charge transport material of holes among a light conducting material or publicly known as the hole injecting layer of the organic EL device.<br><br>
crystals of inorganic semiconductor such as Si, SiC or CdS and amorphous material may be also employed as the hole transfer compound. The hole injecting layer may be composed of single layer comprising one or more kind of these hole injecting materials or may be laminated with a hole injecting layer comprising another kind of compound.<br>
An electron injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention consists of an electron transfer material, and is capable of transferring electron which is injected from the cathode to the light emitting layer. In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable to employ the foregoing compound of the present invention as<br><br>
the electron injecting material. In the case where the compound of the present invention is employed for other than the electron injecting layer, the electron injecting material is not particularly restricted but may be selectively employed in option from among the conventional well known electron injecting material compounds.<br>
As a preferable embodiment of the organic EL device in the present invention, there is a device containing a reductive dopant in an electron transport zone or an interfacial zone between a cathode and an organic compound layer. In the organic EL device of the present invention, it is preferable to employ the foregoing compound of the present invention. The reductive dopant used in the present invention is defined as a compound which is added to the interfacial region between the electron injecting layer and the cathode and enhances the effect of electron injection. Examples of the reductive dopant include at least one compound selected from alkali metals, alkali metal complexes, alkali metal compounds, alkaline earth metals, alkaline earth metal complexes, alkaline earth metal compounds, rare earth metals, rare earth metal complexes and rare earth metal compounds.<br>
Preferable reductive dopant has a work function of 2.9 eV or smaller. Specific examples of preferable reductive dopant include at least one kind or more of the alkaline metal selected from a group consisting of Na (the work function: 2.36 eV), K (the work function: 2.28 eV), Rb (the work function: 2.16 eV) and Cs (the work function: 1.95 eV). Further, the examples include at least one kind or more of the alkaline earth metal selected from a group consisting of Ca (the work function: 2.9 eV), Sr (the work function: 2.0 - 2.5 eV) and Ba (the work function: 2.52 eV). Among<br><br>
these, more preferable reductive dopants include at least one kind or more selected from the group consisting of K, Rb and Cs, the latter Rb or Cs being farther more preferable and the last Cs being the most preferable. These alkaline metals have particularly high reducing capability, and only an addition of relatively small amount of them into an electron injection zone enables to achieve both improvement of luminance and lifetime extension of the organic EL device. In particular, a combination including Cs, for example, combinations of Cs and Na, Cs and K, Cs and Rb or Cs, Na and K are preferable. Containing Cs in combination enables to reveal reducing capability effectively, and the addition into the electron injection zone achieves both improvement of luminance and lifetime extension of the organic EL device. Also, aside from the alkali metals, even an employment of at least one or more kinds of metal compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal chalcogenide, alkaline earth metal chalcogenide, halide of alkali metal and halide of alkaline earth metal also achieves similar effects. Still further, an employment of alkali metal organic complexes or alkaline earth metal organic complexes also achieves similar effects.<br>
In the organic EL device of the present invention, an electron injecting layer comprising electric insulating material, semiconductor and inorganic compound may be disposed between the cathode and the organic layer. The disposition of the electron injecting layer enables to effectively prevent a leak of electric current and to improve the electron injection property. It is preferable that at least one metal compound selected from the group consisting of alkali metal chalcogenides, alkaline earth metal chalcogenides, alkali metal halides and alkaline earth metal halides is<br><br>
used as the insulating material. It is preferable that the electron injecting layer is constituted with the above alkali metal chalcogenide since the electron injecting property can be improved. Preferable examples of the alkali metal chalcogenide include LJ2O, LiO, Na2S, Na2Se and NaO. Preferable examples of the alkaline earth metal chalcogenide include CaO, BaO, SrO, BeO, BaS and CaSe. Preferable examples of the alkali metal halide include LiF, NaF, KF, LiCl, KC1 and NaCl. Preferable examples of the alkaline earth metal halide include fluorides such as CaF2, BaF2, SrF2, MgF2 and BeF2 and halides other than the fluorides.<br>
Examples of the semiconductor constituting the electron transporting layer include oxides, nitrides and oxide nitrides containing at least one element selected from Ba, Ca, Sr, Yb, Al, Ga, In, Li, Na, Cd, Mg, Si, Ta, Sb and Zn, which are used singly or in combination of two or more. It is preferable that the inorganic compound constituting the electron injection layer is in the form of a fine crystalline or amorphous insulating thin film. When the electron injection layer is constituted with the above inorganic compound, a more uniform thin film can be formed and defective pixels such as dark spots can be decreased. Examples of the inorganic compound include the alkali metal chalcogenides, the alkaline earth metal chalcogenides, the alkali metal halides and the alkaline earth metal halides which are described above.<br>
The electron injecting layer in the organic EL device of the present invention can be formed in accordance with the publicly known thin-film formation method such as the vacuum vapor deposition process, the spin coating process, the casting process or the LB process employing the compound of the present invention or other electron injection material.<br><br>
Although the thickness of the electron injecting layer is not particularly limited, the thickness is usually from 5 nm to 5 \x m. The electron injecting layer may be composed of single layer comprising one or more kind of these electron injecting materials or may be laminated with an electron injecting layer comprising another kind of compound. Furthermore, inorganic hole injection materials such as p type-Si and p type-SiC, inorganic electron injection materials such as n type a -Si and n type a "SiC are employed as the electron injection material for composing electron injecting layer. Specific examples of the above electron injection material correspond to inorganic semiconductors disclosed in International Patent Publication No. WO 90/05998, etc.<br>
Following is a description regarding a preparing method about the organic EL device of the present invention. An explanation about an organic EL device of anode / hole injecting layer / light emitting layer / electron injecting layer / cathode type example of the present invention will be described as a preferred embodiment hereinunder. First, a thin film consisting of a desired electrode substance, for example, a substance for the anode is formed over a suitable substrate so as to finally achieve a film thickness of 1  jumor thinner, preferably within a range from 10 nm<br>
to 200 nm in accordance with a vapor deposition method, a sputtering method, etc. Then, the hole injecting layer, the light emitting layer and the electron injecting layer which are all EL device composing elements are made by successively forming thin films consisting of each composing material into multi layers. With regard to a thin film formation process to be used, there are the spin coating process, the casting process or the vapor deposition process as the foregoing description. A vacuum vapor<br><br>
deposition process is preferable because a uniform film can be easily obtained and the possibility of formation of pin holes is small. In the case where the vacuum vapor deposition process is adopted as the thin film formation process, the vapor deposition condition is different according to the kind of the compound employed, a crystal structure or an association structure each as an object of molecular pile membrane. However, it is generally preferable to appropriately select among port heat temperature of 50 to 400 °C, vacuum of 10"6 to 10'3 Pa, vapor deposition rate of 0.01 to 50 nm/ second, substrate temperature of — 50 to 300 °C, and film thickness of 5 nm to5 /zm respectively. After forming the above layers, a<br>
thin film consisting of a cathode substance is formed thereupon into a film thickness of 1  /imor thinner, preferably within a range from 50 to 200<br>
nm, in accordance with, for example, the vapor deposition process or the sputtering process, thereby making cathode and resultantly obtaining a desired organic EL device. Additionally, in preparation of the organic EL device, reversing the formation order, a formation in order of the cathode, the electron injecting layer, the light emitting layer, the hole injecting (transporting) layer and the anode may be applicable.<br>
Further, a preparation of an organic EL device of the anode / the light emitting layer / the cathode type wherein a hole injecting layer, a light emitting layer and an electron injecting layer as coexisting sandwiched between a pair of electrode is as the following" For example, forming a thin film consisting of anode substance over a suitable substrate, making a light emitting layer (or, a light emission area) by applying or dip coating a solution comprising a hole injection material, a light emitting material,     electron    injection    material    and    a    binder    such    as<br><br>
polyvinylcarbazole, polycarbonate, polyacrylate, polyester and polyether or so and, thereupon, forming a film consisting of cathode substance. After further vacuum vapor deposition of device materials which correspond to the light emitting layer or the electron injecting layer over the formed light emitting layer, the film consisting of cathode substance may be formed thereupon.<br>
The organic EL device which can be produced as described above emits light when a direct voltage of 3 to 50 V is applied in the condition that the anode is connected to a positive electrode (+) and the cathode is connected to a negative electrode (—). When the connection is reversed, no<br>
electric current is observed and no light is emitted at all. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, the uniform light emission is observed only in the condition that the polarity of the anode is positive and the polarity of the cathode is negative. When an alternating voltage is applied to the organic EL device, any type of wave shape can be employed.<br>
Employing the derivative of heterocyclic compound having nitrogen atom of the present invention for the organic compound layer, particularly for the electron injecting layer, adhesion between the organic compound layer containing the compound of the present invention and the electrode (particularly, cathode) in the organic EL device of a the present invention is improved.<br>
The organic EL device of the present invention prepared as the foregoing description achieves elevated luminance and excellent efficiency of light emission.<br>
