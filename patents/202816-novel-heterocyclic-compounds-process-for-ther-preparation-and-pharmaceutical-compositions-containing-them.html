This invention particularly relates to novel azolidmedione derivatives of the general formula (I), and their pharmaceutically aceeptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmacetical compositions containing ther<br><br>
The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the above said level, azolidinedione derivati/es, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymophs, their phannaceutically acceptable salts, pharmaceutically acceptable solvates, novel intenuediates and pharmaceutical composition? "containing them.<br>
The azolidinedione derivatives of the general formula (I) dotined above of the presc.u invention are useful for the treatment and / or prophylaxis of diseases or conditions iis which insi-ilin resistance is the ixsiderlying pat!) physiological mechanism. Examples of ;"«.se (ii.sear.es and conditions are type II diabetes, mipaued glucose tolerance, dysi"pidaemia, hypertensioi). corona 17 heart disease and other cardiovascular disorders including atherof;clerosJs. The azolidhiedionej derivatives of the formula (I) are useful for the treatment of i"jsulin resistance associated with obesity and psoriasis. The azohdinedicyr derivatives of the formula (I) can also be used to trei.; diabetic complications and can be used for treatment and / or prophylaxis of other diseases and conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), certain renal diseases including diabetic nepluopathy,   glomerulonephritis,   glomerular   sclerosis,   nephrotic    syndrome,   hypertensive<br><br>
nephrosclerosis, end-stage renal diseases and microalbuminuria as well as certain eating disorders, as aldose reductase inhibitors and for improving cognitive fiinctions in dementia.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Insulm resistance is the diminished ability of insuhn to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insuhn resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect ; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops mto diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabet&amp;s meUitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlip demia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med.; (1987) 317 : 350 - 357 ; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., (1988) 66 : 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest, (1975) 68 : 957 - 969) and other renal comphcations (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsuhnemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes melUtus. The association of insulm resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has beew described as a syndrcme having insulin resisiance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrpme-X. In addition, polycystic ovarian syndrome (Patent Application No. WO 95/07697), psoriasis (Patent AppUcatlon No. WO 95/35108), dementia (Behavioral Brain Research (1996) 75 : 1 - 11) etc, may also have iasuUu resistance as a central pathogenic feature.<br>
A number of molecular defects have been associaced with k&amp;ulm resistance. These include reduced expression of insulm receptors on the plasma membrane of msuUn responsive cells and alterations m the signal transduction pathways that become ac*" ited after insuhn binds to its receptor includmg glucose transport and glycogen synthesis.<br>
Since defective insulin action is thought to be more important than failure of insulin secretion in the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and other related complications, this raises doubts about the iutiinsic suitabihty of antidiabetic treatment that is<br><br>
based entirely upon stimulation of insulin release. Recently, Takeda has developed a new class of compounds wliicb are the derivatives of 5-(4-alkoxybenzyl)-2,4-thiazolidmediones of the fonnula (n) (Ref Chem. PharntBull. 1982, 3(?, 3580-3600). In the formula (H), V represents substituted or unsubstituted divalent aromatic group and U represents various groups wliich have been reported in various patent documents.<br><br>
By way of examples, U may represent the follov^ig groups:<br>

where V represents substituted or unsubstituted divalent aryl or hetero aryl group, W represents<br>

These compounds<br><br><br>
Some of the above referenced hitherto kiiowii antidiabetic compounds seem to possess bone marrow depression, liver and cardiac toxicities and modest potency and consequently, their regular use for the treatment and control of diabetes is becoming limited and restricted.<br>

The reaction temperature may range fiom 80 ^C to 140 ^C depending upon the solvents employed and in the range from 80 ^C to 180 ^C when the reaction is carried out neat in the presence of sodium acetate. Suitable catalyst such as piperidinium acetate or benzoate, sodium acetate or mixtures of catalysts may also be employed. Sodium acetate can be used in the presence of solvent, but it is preferred tliat sodium acetate is used neat.

Oxazolidme-2-oxo-4-thiione may be used instead of 2,4-oxazohdinedioue. However, the thio group needs to be converted to oxo group by oxidation using agents such as hydrogen peroxide or peroxyacids like mCPBA.<br><br>
