				<td>Method for the decomposition of N2O, catalyst therefor and preparation of this catalyst<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N,O. The invention also relates to1 a catalyst therefor, as well as the preparation of this catalyst.<br>
State of the art<br>
Dinitrogen oxide or laughing gas (N2O) contributes substantially to the greenhouse effect and has a high global warming potential (the degree to which a molecule contributes to the greenhouse effect relative to a molecule of CO3). Over the past few years a policy has been developed for reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. Various significant sources of N2O emissions have been identified: agriculture, the industrial production of precursors for nylon (adipic acid and caprolactam), the production of nitric acid and motor vehicles equipped with a three-way catalyst.<br>
Various catalytic and non-catalytic techniques can be used to render laughing gas harmless. Various catalysts are known for, for example, the catalytic decomposition or conversion of N2O into N2 and O2 (for example JP Patent Application no. Hei-06-154611, in which catalysts based on supports with transition metals and noble metals are described). However, this reaction with catalysts according to the state of the art is severely impeded by the presence of oxygen and water, which occur in the off-gases from virtually all the abovementioned sources of N2O.<br>
A promising alternative is selective catalytic reduction. Various catalysts are known from the literature for the conversion of N2O with the aid of reducing agents such as alkenes (CnH2n), alcohols or ammonia. On technical and economic grounds, additiotis of saturated hydrocarbons (CnH2n+2) would be preferred to the said reducing agents. In particular natural gas (CH4) and LPG (mixture of C3H8 and C4HIO) are attractive in this context.<br>
A disadvantage of the method using catalysts that are able to reduce N2O with the aid of<br><br>
hydrocarbons is that additional facilities for hydrocarbons have to be put in place and hydrocarbons and/or CO can be emitted. From the environmental standpoint, an additional catalyst is often used to avoid the emission of hydrocarbons.<br>
WO2004009220 describes the catalytic reduction of NOX, but this disclosure does not provide a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O.<br>
A disadvantage of many known catalysts for decomposition of N2O is that these catalysts are often unstable and/or are deactivated by the presence of gases such as NOK (NO, NO2, N2O, (x = 3/2), etc.), O, and H2O. However these gases are virtually always present in practical situations, such as for the decomposition of N2O from flue gases.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The aim of the invention is, therefore, to provide a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O where the abovementioned disadvantages are completely or partially eliminated. A further aim of the invention is to provide a catalyst for use in this method, as well as a method for the preparation of this catalyst.<br>
Surprisingly it is found that the catalysts according to the invention give good conversion of N2O, even at low temperatures, are stable during the decomposition reaction (of N2O into N2 and O2) and also give good conversion and have good stability if other gases (such as NO, NO2, N2O3, etc., O2 and H2O) are also present in the gas containing N2O. In addition, advantageously no hydrocarbon has to be added to the gas containing N2O. Therefore these catalysts are exceptionally suitable for the decomposition of N2O.<br>
The invention relates to a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O in the presence of a catalyst, wherein the catalyst comprises a zeolite that has been loaded with a first .metal selected from the group of noble metals consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, silver, rhenium, osmium, indium, platinum and gold, preferably ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and indium, and with a second metal selected from the group of transition metals consisting of vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper, and wherein the loading of the zeolite with metals has been obtained by first loading the zeolite with the noble metal and then with the transition metal.<br><br>
The invention also provides a method for the preparation of a catalyst for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O, wherein the catalyst comprises a zeolite and the zeolite is first loaded with a first metal selected from the group of noble metals consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, silver, rhenium, osmium, indium, platinum and gold and then loaded with a second metal selected from the group of transition metals consisting of vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper.<br>
The invention furthermore also provides a catalyst that can be obtained according to this method and, for example, contains 0.00001 - 4 % (m/m) of the first metal and 0.1 -10 % (m/m) of the second metal, as well as the use of this catalyst for the decomposition ofN2O.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The gas containing N2O can be, for example, off-gas from the synthesis of nitric acid or, for example, off-gas that is liberated during the production of nylon precursors. The gas can also contain oxygen and/or water. In contrast to the majority of catalysts according to the state of the art, the catalyst according to the invention loses little or no activity in the presence of oxygen, water or both. This applies in particular if the water is present in amounts of up to approx. 5-10 % (V/V) (percent by volume; percent by volume relates to the volume of the gas containing N2O, including any NOX, O2 and H2O, etc. present). Up to approx. 20 %, for example 0.5 - 20 % (V/V), oxygen can be present, for example. NO, can also be present, for example from approx. 10 ppm - 5 % NOX, for example 10 ppm - 1 % (V/V) NO,. Therefore, in one embodiment the invention is aimed at a method where the gas containing N2O also contains oxygen and/or water, as well as a method where the gas containing N2O also contains one or more gasses selected from the group consisting of oxygen, water and NOX (for example all three gases are present alongside N2O). Therefore, in the context of the invention, gas containing N2O means that the gas in any event contains N2O and in addition can contain other gases such as N2, NOX, H2O, O2, etc. This gas (or gas mixture) can, as is known to those skilled in the art, be brought into contact with a catalyst. "Decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O" means that N2O that is present in the gas is in any event partially decomposed (with the aid of the catalyst according to the invention) to give N2 and O2.<br>
More particularly, the invention is aimed .at a method for the catalytic decomposition of<br><br>
N2O in a gas containing N2O, comprising:<br>
-	the provision of a catalyst, wherein the catalyst comprises a zeolite that has been<br>
loaded with a lirst metal selected from the group of noble metals consisting of<br>
ruthenium, rhodium, silver, rhenium, osmium, indium, platinum and gold and with a<br>
second metal selected from the group of transition metals consisting of vanadium,<br>
chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper;<br>
-	the provision of a gas containing N2O and feeding the gas containing N2O through a<br>
chamber that contains the catalyst, wherein the chamber, the gas containing N2O or<br>
both are heated if required.<br>
The gas containing N2O is contacted with the catalyst according to the invention and N20 is at least partially decomposed in a composition reaction. During the reaction it is possible, if required, to heat up to a temperature at which (complete or partial) decomposition of N2O can take place; however, the gas containing N2O can, as off-gas, already have the desired temperature or be cooled to the desired temperature. The chamber is, for example, a reactor (chamber), a reaction tube, or any other space where the N2O-containing gas can be brought into contact with the catalyst of the invention, as is known to those skilled in the art. Preferably, the chamber is a reactor, designed to decompose N2O, as known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
In the description of the invention NOX is defined as nitrogen oxides where x is greater than or equal to 1, such as NO, NO2) N2O3, etc. Thus, N2O, laughing gas, is not understood as falling under this tenn. NO is usually in equilibrium with other nitrogen oxides, where x is greater than 1. The catalyst according to the invention is found to be exceptionally suitable for the decomposition of N2O from a gas containing N2O, without the stability suffering from the possible presence of NO, NO,, etc. (NOJ. Therefore, in one embodiment the invention also provides a method where the gas containing N2O also contains NOX, where x is equal to or greater than 1, for example x = 1, 3/2, 2, etc. Of course, the gas can also contain combinations of such NOX compounds. Hence, in an embodiment the N2O-containing gas contains at least N2O and NOX.<br>
In particular the present invention is aimed at the decomposition of N2O where the gas containing N,O essentially does not contain any hydrocarbon. The gas containing N2O<br><br>
preferably contains less than 200 ppm, more preferably less than 50 ppm, even more preferably less than 20 ppm hydrocarbon, based on the total amount of gas containing N2O, or, for example, less than 5 % (V/V), preferably less than 3 % (V/V), more preferably less than 1 % (V/V) hydrocarbon, based on the amount of N2O in the gas containing N2O. More particularly, the gas essentially contains no CnH2n+2 (where n is preferably selected from 1 -4, including all isomers).<br>
The process conditions for the method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O will depend on the applications. Those skilled in the art will in general choose the catalyst volume, the gas velocity, the temperature, the pressure, etc. such that the best conversion results are achieved. Good results are achieved with, for example, an N2O content of approx. 100 ppm or more, for example approx. 100 -100,000 ppm of the gas containing N,O. Under practical conditions the quantity of N2O will in general be<br>
i<br>
between approx. 100 and 3000 ppm of the gas containing N2O. The gas containing N2O is preferably fed at gas space velocities (GHSV; gas hourly space velocity) of approx. 200 -200,000 h"1, preferably 1000 - 100,000 h'!, where this value relates to the catalyst volume used. The pressure of the gas containing N2O will depend on the application and can be, for example, between approx. 1 - 50 bara (bar atmosphere: bara), preferably between approx. 1-25 bara. The method can be used at relatively low temperatures. The conversion of N2O takes place from approx. 300 °C. Virtually complete conversion can already take place at approx. 375 °C, depending on the conditions, such as, for example, the gas space velocity, volume and catalyst loading, etc. Preferably a method where the reaction temperature is between 300 °C and 600 °C, more preferentially between 350 °C and 500 °C, and even more preferably between about 375 and 475 °C, is used. In yet a further embodiment, the reaction temperature is between about 300 °C and 450 °C, more preferably between about 350 °C and 425 °C, and even more preferably below 400 °C, and the gas containing N2O is fed at gas space velocities (GHSV; gas hourly space velocity) of approx. 200 - 20,000 h"', preferably 1000- 15,000 h'1, even more preferably about 6000-10,000 h'1, where this value relates to the catalyst volume used.<br>
The method according to the invention can be used, inter alia, for the catalytic reduction of N2O that is emitted, for example, by emergency power generators, gas engines, installations for nitric acid production, N2O that is emitted during caprolactam production,<br><br>
during coal combustion in a fluidised bed, etc. Therefore, the invention is also aimed at the use of the catalyst according to the invention for, for example, the catalytic decomposition of N.,O. 1 lie method according to the invention can also be used in combination with a catalyst for the removal of NOX, which, for example, is also emitted during the industrial production of nitric acid.<br>
Zeolites that arc used in the method according to the invention are, for example, the following xcolites, as arc known to those skilled in the art by their abbreviations (for example Atlas or xcolite framework types, Ch. Baerlocher, W.M. Meier, D.H.

Combinations of (loaded) zeolites can also be used.<br>
Preferably zeolites based on silicon and aluminium, with an Si/Al ratio of 2 - 60, preferably 2.5 - 30, are used. For example, good results are obtained where the zeolite is selected from the group consisting of FAU, PER, CHA, MOR, MFI, BEA, EMT, CON BOG and ITQ-7. In a preferred embodiment the invention is aimed at a method where the zeolite is selected from the group consisting of PER, CHA, MOR and BEA. Especially preferred are FER, CHA and BEA and even more preferred are FER and BEA. Especially BEA shows a surprising high stability in the N2O-decomposition method of the invention.<br>
Part of the /oolite framework ions may have been replaced with other ions like Fe, Ti etc., as known to the person skilled in the art. For example, up to about 5 mol % of Si or Al may have been replaced by Fe or Ti or other ions, like Ga or Ge, or combinations of two or<br><br>
more of such ions. Such a replacement of framework ions may be effected by replacing part of the "framework ions to be" in the starting materials by l;c or Ti (or other ions), as is known to the person skilled in the art. If desired, the zeolite may be subjected to a steam treatment, after synthesis of the zeolite or after the subsequent loading with the first and second metal, such that part of this framework metal may become available within the pores as catalytkally active sites. In such a way, Co-Rh-BEA or Ni-Ru-MFI having Fe as framework ion may for example be converted to Fe,Co-Rh-BEA or Fe,Ni-Ru-MFI, respectively.<br>
In yet another preferred embodiment zeolites such as FER, CHA and MFI (ZSM-5) are used, which zeolites have relatively small channels and do not have excessively large rings such as 12-membered rings. Zeolites in this embodiment can have 4, 5, 6, 8 or 10-membered rings (or combinations thereof). In a variant embodiment the invention is aimed at a method and a catalyst where the second metal is a trivalent metal such as iron (Felll) and where the zeolite is selected from the group consisting of zeolites that have 4, 5, 6, 8 or 10-membered rings (or combinations thereof) but no rings contain more than 10 members. In another variant embodiment the invention is aimed at a method and a catalyst where the second metal is a divalent metal such as cobalt (Coll) and where the zeolite is selected from the group consisting of zeolites that have 4, 5, 6, 8, 10 or 12-membered rings (or combinations thereof) and where the zeolite contains at least 10- or 12-membered rings (or both).<br>
There are various ways of preparing the catalyst according to the invention. The zeolite can be loaded with the aid of methods such as are known to those skilled in the art, for example with the aid of wet impregnation (volume of liquid with (dissolved) salt is greater than pore volume of zeolite) and pore volume impregnation ("dry impregnation" or "incipient wetness": volume of liquid with (partially dissolved) salt is equal to pore volume of zeolite) or via ion exchange (exchange in the liquid phase, where the metals to be exchanged in any event are at least partially dissolved in the liquid phase as ions (or complexed ions); and where the zeolite is stirred in the liquid containing ions to be exchanged, as is known to those skilled in the art) or with the aid of chemical vapour deposition (CVD). Preferably a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O is used where the zeolite that is used for this composition has been loaded<br><br>
with the first metal by means of ion exchange or impregnation and a subsequent loading with the second metal and is used as such, or after possible further steps such as drying, sieving and/or calcination, applying to a support, etc., for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O. In a preferred embodiment a method is used where the zeolite has been loaded with the first metal by means of ion exchange.<br>
The same applies lor the second metal. Therefore, preferably a method is used where the zeolite has been loaded with the second metal by means of ion exchange or impregnation; in an embodiment a method is used where the zeolite has been loaded with the second metal by means of ion exchange. In a specific embodiment a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O is used where the zeolite has been loaded with the first melal and the second metal by means of ion exchange (sequential). This yields good decomposition values.<br>
In this invention metal is used to mean that an element that is known to those skilled in the art as a metal (for example the metals from groups 3-12 of the periodic table of the elements (1UPAC notation) is used in the invention, in the invention transition metals are metals from groups 3 - 12 of the periodic table of the elements (IUPAC notation), also known as the groups Ib, lib - Vllb and VIII. The second metal is used to refer to those transition metals that are not at the same time also a noble metal. Noble metals are the metals Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Re, Os, Ir, Pt and AU. In the invention, Ru, Rh, Ag, Re, Os, Ir, Pt and Au, and preferably, Ru, Rh, Os and Ir (group 8 and 9 noble metals) are used. When loading the /eolile, in general salts in solution (ion exchange), where the metal is present in ion form (usually in water), or solutions (wet or pore volume impregnation (incipient wetness)), where the metal is present as ion in solution and/or as ion in a salt compound, will be used. Because ion exchange (in the liquid phase) or pore volume impregnation is preferably used, after preparation and before calcination the catalyst will generally comprise a zeolite in which the metal is present in ion form (and coordinated with Al). After calcination and/or while carrying out the method according to the invention some of the metal in ion form can be converted to oxide and/or to metal at the exchange locations, for example by clustering to give particles. This behaviour of zeolites exchanged with metals is known to those skilled in the art. In this invention, metal is therefore also used to refer to metal ion and, for example after loading of (the application of the metals to) the<br><br>
zeolite, metal can further also comprise metal oxide or metal salt (for example chloride,<br>
oxycloride, nilraic. sulphate, etc.).<br>
In one embodiment a method is used where the zeolite has been loaded with the first metal by means of ion exchange. This can lead to a zeolite where 2-50 % of the Al has been coordinated by the first metal; more preferentially approx. 5 - 40 % of the Al has been coordinated by the first metal. This can be determined with the aid of, for example, IR techniques, etc. Thus, for.example, the integral intensity of the bridged OH stretch vibration (approx. 3600 cm'1, depending on the type of zeolite and the measurement temperature) of an activated zeolite can be compared with the same zeolite loaded with the metal of choice. This integral intensity correlates with the concentration of aluminium in the zeolite. As a result of exchanging with the metal of choice the integral intensity decreases and the difference in intensity (before/after exchange) is the amount of metal that coordinates with aluminium.<br>
After loading the zeolite, the zeolite is generally dried. It can then be calcined. Instead of calcination (healing in air, oxygen) it is also possible to reduce (heating in a reducing atmosphere) or activate in an inert atmosphere (heating in an inert atmosphere). Such procedures are known to those skilled in the art as 'post-modification' procedures. Calcination is generally carried out in air at, for example, 400 - 550 °C. Reduction can be effected with hydrogen at, for example, 300 - 500 °C. Inert activation can be done with the aid of nitrogen, argon, helium, etc., at, { for example, approx. 300- 550 °C. These procedures usually take a few hours.<br>
Good decomposition results are obtained if a method is used where the first metal has been selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium. In another embodiment a zeolite is used where the second metal is selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel. Preferably, a method for the catalytic decomposition of N2O in a gas containing N2O is used where the first metal has been selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium and where the second metal has been selected from the group consisting of iron, cobalt and nickel. In a preferred embodiment, a method and a catalyst for decomposition of N2O are provided, wherein the catalyst comprises a zeolite and wherein the zeolite is selected from the group consisting of<br><br>
FAU, FER, CHA, MOR, MFI, BEA, EMT, CON, BOG and ITQ-7. Preferred first metals arc selected from (he group consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium.<br>
Specific preferred embodiments comprise methods according to the invention and catalysts according to the invention where the second metal is Fe and the zeolite is FER, or where the second metal is Co and the zeolite is MOR. In another preferred embodiment the invention comprises a method and catalyst where the second metal is Co and the zeolite is FER, for example Co-Rh-FER, or where the second metal is Fe and the zeolite is MOR, for example Fe-Rh-MOR. Therefore, the invention is also aimed at a method and a catalyst where the zeolite loaded with metals has been selected from the group consisting of Fe-Rh-FER, Fe-Ir-FER, Fe-Ru-FER, Co-Rh-MOR, Co-Ir-MOR, Co-Ru-MOR, Fe-Rh-MOR, Fe-Ir-MOR, Fe-Ru-MOR, Co-Rh-FER, Co-Ir-FER and Co-Ru-FER. Further preferred catalysts are Fe-Rh-BEA, Fe-lr-BEA, Fe-Ru-BEA, Co-Rh-BEA, Co-Ir-BEA and Co-Ru-BEA<br>
The catalyst according to the invention preferably comprises a zeolite that contains approx. 0.00001-4% (m/m) of the first metal (0.00001% (m/m) is 10 ppm) and approx. 0.1-10 % (m/m) of the second metal. More preferentially, the zeolite contains approx. 0.01 to 0.5 % (m/m), more preferably 0.1-0.5 % (m/m), of the first metal and approx. 0.5 to 4 % (m/m), more preferably 1-4 %(m/m), of the second metal. Of course, combinations of "first" metals can also be used, as well as combinations of "second" metals, etc., for example: Fe-Ir,Ru-FER, Co,Ni-Ir-MOR and Co,Ni-Rh,Os-MOR etc. Likewise, a first and a second loading do not preclude one or more subsequent loadings.<br>
The catalyst according to the invention preferably comprises the zeolite only. In another embodiment the catalyst comprises zeolite and a quantity of support, for example 0.1 - 50 % (m/m) of boehmite, for example in the form of pellets or applied to a monolite, as is known to those skilled in the art. The amounts of metal (first metal and second metal) arc related lo the amount of zeolite; the metals are present on and in the zeolite.<br>
Known salts, such as, for example, readily soluble nitrates are used for the ion exchange. The zeolite used can be, for example, the H, Na, K or NH4 form of the zeolite, such as, for example, NH4-MOR or H-FAU, etc. Exchange is continued for such a length of time (or so<br><br>
often) that approx, 0.00001 - 4 % (m/m) of the first metal is present in the zeolite. The zeolite can also he loaded in other ways (pore volume impregnation, etc.). The zeolite is then preferably filtered off, washed and optionally dried. The zeolite is then loaded with 0.1 - 10 % (m/m) of the second metal. This can be done by ion exchange (in the liquid phase) or by pore volume impregnation (incipient wetness technique), etc. (see above). The zeolite is then dried and calcined if required.<br>
In addition to (lie above-mentioned 1R techniques that are able to demonstrate that the preferably desirc-d percentage exchange with regnrd to the first metal has been achieved, the advantage of the method for the application according to the invention can also be determined in other ways, using, for example, electron microscopy or CO chemisorption. By this means it is possible to map what the final dispersion of noble metal has become as a function of the sequence. In the case of CO chemisorption, for example, the amount of CO to be bound is a measure of the dispersion of the noble metal.<br>
The catalyst of the invention, obtainable by the method for preparation according to the invention, comprises a zeolite being loaded with a first metal selected from the group of noble metals consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, silver, rhenium, osmium, indium, platinum and gold, and with a second metal selected from the group of transition metals consisting of vanadium, chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel and copper. In a preferred embodiment, the catalyst of the invention consists of the zeolite, i.e. the catalyst of the invention is the zeolite as prepared according to the invention (optionally provided to a support). Preferred zeolites are selected from the group consisting of FAU, PER, CHA, MOR, MFI, BBA, EMT, CON, BOG and ITQ-7, especially PER, CHA and BEA. Preferred first metals are selected from the group consisting of ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and indium, even more preferred are Ru, Rh and Ir. In another embodiment, the catalyst of the invention may further comprise other catalysts, e.g. other catalysts suitable for the decomposition of N2O and/or catalysts suitable for the decomposition of NOX.<br>
In contrast to prior art catalysts (wherein e.g. first the transition metal ion has been introduced in the zeolite and then the noble metal) the catalyst of the invention comprises a zeolite wherein about 2 - 50 % of the Ai is coordinated by the first metal. Another important distinction of the catalyst (i.e. zeolite) of the invention is that the zeolite has a<br><br>
relatively constant concentration of first metal through the bulk of the zeolite particles and an even coneenlralion over the different /oolite panicles. The concentration of the first meUil jn a /enlile particle (for example a pressed zeolite particle of about 0.1-5 nun diameter) can be measured at different positions (local concentrations) within the particle, (e.g. by SEM/EDX) thereby providing a mean first metal concentration. Hence, herein the term "local" concentration refers to a concentration measured by SEM/EDX at one spot of a zeolite particle, preferably with a scan resolution of about 0.5-5 urn2, preferably a scan resolution of about O.I-1 urn"'. Herein, a x.eolite having a mean (first) metal concentration refers to the bulk (or mean) concentration of e.g. a zeolite crystallite (e.g. about 0.1-10 uin), a zeolite (bulk) powder (e.g. consisting of such crystallites), a pressed particle, etc. A number of measurements of local concentrations may be used to calculate a mean metal concentration. For example, determining the concentration at one spot of about 0.1-1 u.m2, moving to another spot in the zeolite powder or another spot in the zeolite crystallite, e.g. at a distance of a few urn's from the first spot, and determining a second local concentration, etc. Averaging the local (first) metal concentrations measured provides the mean (first) metal concenfration. It appears that the zeolite catalyst provided according to the method of preparation  of the  invention  is  a  zeolite,  wherein  local  first metal  concentrations advantageously appear to have concentration deviations of not larger than 50%, preferably not larger than 30 %, and more preferably not larger than 20 %, of the mean first metal concentration. Hence, there is provided a zeolite having a mean first metal concentration, and wherein any local first metal concentration may have a concentration deviation of not larger than 50% of the mean first metal concentration. The surprisingly even distribution of the first metal may provide the good N2O-decomposition results of the present catalysts; in case the opposite order of loading was chosen, lower N2O conversions arc obtained.<br>
Examples Test equipment<br>
The catalytic decomposition of N2O (and any NOJ was studied in a semi-automatic test set-up. Gases are supplied using so-called mass flow controllers (MFC) and water is added by means of a saturator that is set to the correct temperature. Lines are heated to 130 °C to counteract condensation. For the experiments a quartz reactor with an internal diameter of 0.6 to 1 cm was placed in an oven. The catalyst sieve fraction (0.25 - 0.5 rnm) was placed on a quartz gauze. Quantitative analysis of the gas phase is possible by the use of a<br><br>
calibrated Bomen MB 100 Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer equipped with a model ^100 gas analyser or with the aid of a Perkin Elmer GC-TCD. The carrier gas (balance) in the examples is N2.<br>

It can be seen from this experiment that a physical mixture does not have the good properties such as the catalyst according to the invention. If the catalyst according to the invention is prepared, the presence of a first metal, such as Ru, Ir and Rh, and a second metal, such as Fe and Co, apparently produces a synergistic effect on the decomposition of N2O. This synergistic effect is visible in particular at lower temperatures, such as between approx. 350 - 430 °C, in particular 370 - 430 °C.<br>
Cat 5 was also tested in a CH4-SCR setup as described in WO2004009220 under the conditions of table 3 of WO2004009220, but it appeared that this catalyst was not suitable for NOX-conversion by CH, (NOx-conversion

It can be seen from these results that the combination of Ru-Fe provides a significant higher N2O-conveision. especially in the temperature range of about 385-470 °C. Further, it appeared that the Fe-Ru-BEA catalyst is also very stable in the conversion of N2O.<br>
Example 11: l'ariutii)n in concentration oj first metal<br>
The weight percentage of Rh was measured at different spots of samples of zeolites first loaded with Rh or first loaded with Cu. SElvl / EDX (scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) measurements were performed with a JEOL-JSM-6330F microscope. Such measurements are known to the person skilled in the art. The samples are subjected to irradiation by a focused electron beam, which results in imaging of secondary or back-scattered electrons and energy analysis of x-rays for view and cross-section surface imaging and composition analysis. With the SEM/EDX analysis technique, particles can be imaged by SEM, providing information on the physical properties of particles including<br><br>
size, shape, and surface morphology, while EDX provides information on the elemental composition of particles.<br>
