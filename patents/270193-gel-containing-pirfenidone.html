				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to a gel formula that contains Pirfenidone, which offers advantages over other pharmaceutical forms of known cutaneous administration in the state of the technique.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2(lH)-pyridone, formula;<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
It is a drug that has been applied in the restoration of tissues with lesions with fibrosis and the prevention of fibrotic lesions. This compound, Pirfenidone, it is by itself a known compound and its pharmacological effects has been described, for example, in Japanese applications numbers 87677/1974 and 1284338/1976, as an anti-inflammatory agent that includes antipyretic and analgesics. The United States Patents no. 3, 839, 346, published October 1st of 1974; the number 3, 974, 281, published august 10th of 1976; the number 4, 042, 699 published august 16th of 1977, and the number 4, 052, 509 published October 4th of 1977, which described the methods for the obtained Pirfenidone, as well as its use as an antiinflammatory agent. In the Mexican patent 182, 266 the antifibrotic activity of the 5-methyl-l-phenyl-2(lH)-pyridone is described.<br><br>
Different resources and treatments have been used to the date and none of them have shown to be really effective. Pirfenidone has shown its efficacy as an anti-fibrotic agent in different pathologies and organs, and has been demonstrated in previous works, where we have observed an effect on the fibroblasts and the production of collagen and extracellular matrix, as well as in experimental models and in clinical tests also.<br>
Many substances could form gels when a gelificant agent is added. This is use in many diverse products in the manufacturing industry, from food to paint, passing through adhesives.<br>
Gels are also important in the chemistry part related with the processes SOL_GEL and in the synthesis of solid materials with nanopores.<br>
Gels are classified in: aqueous (hydrogels) or organic (organogels), dependingo if the aqueous component is water or an organic solvent; organic or inorganic in nature, colloidal or thick grain, according to the size of the particles; and rigid gels, elastic ortixothrophic, according to its mechanic properties.<br>
The hydrocolloids are substances that are produced from vegetable and animal proteins or multiple sugars. They have the capacity to swell themselves and to bind to water. The hydrocolloids are used to thicken, solidify and stabilize food.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a gel composition for its cutaneous administration that contains Pirfenidone, a viscous agent; a solubilizer; a non ionic solubilizer; a conserving agent; a neutralizer agent and purified water.<br>
Also, it is the object of the present invention to provide a process of manufacture of a gel that contains pirfenidone for its cutaneous application.<br><br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a gel medicine to be used as an anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory agent.<br>
SPECIFICATION OF THE INVENTION<br>
COMPOSITION OF THE GEL<br>
The composition of the gel contains from 2 to 12% of Pirfenidone is elaborated utilizing from 0.4 to 1.2% of a viscous agent, from 10 to 30% of a solubilizer, from 5 to 15% of a non ionic solubilizer, from 0.2 to 1% of a conserving agent, from 0.4 to 1.2% a neutralizer agent and the rest of purify water. The viscous agent is selected from a carbomer 940 (MR); Ultrex 10(MR), cellulose derivatives; gums; polioxameres; ethylic alcohol and propylenglycol; the conserving agent is selected from a group that consist of Diazolidinyl urea, iodopropinil-butilcarbamate; methylparabene and a mix of these compounds; the neutralizer agent is selected from a group of primary, secondary and tertiary aliphatic amines of the mono-, bi- and triethanolamine type, and of the hydroxide alkaline metals, such as sodium hydroxide.<br>
An example of the composition of the gel is shown in the table 1:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The gel containing Pirfenidone is manufactured as follows:<br>
a)	Mix 50% of the total water to be used with the viscous agent, allowing the complete humectation of the viscous agent;<br>
b)	Mix separately and with constant agitation the Pirfenidone with the solubilizer agent;<br>
c)	Dissolve separately the non ionic solubilizer agent in the 25% water to be used at 40Â°C, once dissolved, the 15% of the total water is added;<br>
d)	Add the solution from part c) to the mix from part b), agitate until the mix is homogenate.<br>
e)	Dilute the neutralizer agent in 10% of the total water to use, agitate until the mix is homogenate; and<br>
f)	Add with constant agitation and homogenate in each addition to the mix from part a) the solution from part d); the conservative and the solution from part e).<br>
A prepared composition according to procedure describe is shown in table 2.<br><br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These compositions are shown in an example mode, but they are not limited in any level of the reach of the description of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
