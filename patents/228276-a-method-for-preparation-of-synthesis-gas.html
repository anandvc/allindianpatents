				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The   present   invention   relates   to   a   method   for   the   preparation   of synthesis gas.<br>
The catalytic partial oxidation of hydrocarbons, natural gas or methane to synthesis gas, which consist in mixtures of hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in various proportions, has been processed for mariy years. While currently limited as an industrial process, the partial oxidation is also of interest for the significant released heat and for the use of smaller reactors. More particularly, the .partial oxidation of methane at short residence time is a goal to reach synthesis gas using an alternative process to the steam reforming process, which is today the most popular one.<br>
Synthesis gas can be used as feed for fuel cell or as a reducing atmosphere in the metallurgic industry but it is mainly the key step for activation of methane for the indirect production of methanol and middle distillate in the petrochemical and chemical industries.<br>
The advantage of the catalytic partial oxidation of methane is mainly its strong<br>
exothermic character in the short residence time. Both parameters allow producing<br>
synthesis gas with lower investment cost without delivering large quantities of external<br>
energy.	.<br>
Nevertheless, because this strong exothermic character of the total oxidation reactions, the temperature of the catalytic bed reaches more than well above 1000°C.<br>
There is thus a need for very stable catalyst in terms of metal sintering and support<br>
resistance.	.<br>
Furthermore, as the catalyst activity affects the thermal profile of the reactor, a careful modulation is therefore required to avoid hot spot in the reactor which can light on the homogeneous reaction.<br>
A novel approach relates to the possibility of introducing the metal in the crystallographic structure of a given material and then to. activate the catalyst by reducing the metal "in situ" or under hydrogen flow. This allows in some case to develop a strong interaction between metal and surface, Some of these catalysts have a Perovskite structure.<br>
US 5,149,516 discloses the partial oxidation of methane'to produce carbon monoxide and hydrogen using a Perovskite catalyst, such as LaCoO3-.<br>
US 5,447,705 discloses a catalyst for the partial oxidation of methane or of a gaseous mixture containing methane, said catalyst preferably having a Perovskite structure with LaFeNi as a cation composition. However, in the reported examples it is very difficult<br>
to balance the structure stability. On one hand, if the reducible metal (Ni and Co) is present in large amount, the structure is completely reduced and the Perovskite structure becomes unstable. On the other hand, if the reducible cation is present in low amount, the catalytic activity is poor and does not allow to work with short residence time.<br>
US 6,110,861 discloses a two-part catalyst comprising a dehydrogenation portion and an oxide-ion conducting portion.<br>
WO 0160742 discloses a catalysts and a processes for the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons to carbon monoxide and hydrogen employing new families of chromium-rare earth based catalysts .<br>
Today, none of the existing catalytic partial oxidation processes is able to provide a sufficiently high conversion of the reactant gas together with a high selectivity of CO and H2 reaction products, without using high quantities(of rare and costly catalysts, nor without experiencing adverse effects such as an excessive coking of the catalyst, or a premature-catalyst failure by its lack of heat resistance or by its mechanical instability or even by the mechanical instability of its structure.<br>
That is why there is a continuing need for new catalysts that are mechanically stable and retains a high level of activity and selectivity to CO and H2 products under conditions of high temperature, without excessive coking.<br>
The inventors have found that the catalysts of the present invention overcome some<br>
of these drawbacks.	,<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition characterized in that it essentially consists in a solid solution of a mixture of at least a perovskite cristallographic structure with nickel and/or rhodium metal.<br>

Example 1: LaFe0.7Ni0.25Rh0.05O3 (Invention)<br>
5.3 g of La(NO3)3, 4.6 g of Fe(NO3)3, 1.2 g of Ni(NO3)2 and 0.83 g of Rh nitrate solution 10 % w/w are dissolved in 300 ml of distilled water and slowly dropped in a solution containing 7.7 g of citric acid dissolved in 400 ml of ethylene glycol. After mixing, the resulting solution are heated at 90°C for 4 h. The evaporation of water from the solution brings to the formation of a sol (colloidal solution with micrometric micelles). The catalyst is dried in oven at 90°C then the oven temperature is increased to 180°C over night. In this step, a gel is formed and dried. The obtained solid is calcined at 500°C for 4 h and then at 900°C for 12 h. The XRD shows the perovskite cubic pattern (figure 1) and the surface area after calcination is 8 m2/g.

mixing, the resulting solution is heated at 90°C for 4 h. The evaporation of water from the solution brings to the formation of a sol (colloidal solution with micrometric micelles). The catalyst is dried in oven at 90°C then the oven temperature is increased to 180°C over night. In this step, a gel is formed and dried. The obtained solid is calcined at 500°C for 4 h and then at 900°C for 12 h. The XRD shows the perovskite cubic pattern and the reflection of the CeO2 phase (Figure 2). The surface area after calcination is 10 m /g. Figure 2 discloses XRD patterns of La0.8Ce0.2Fe0.7Ni0.25Rh0.05O3 catalysts after calcination at 900°C / (+) ABO3 perovskite structure, (*) CeO2 compound.<br>
Example 3: LaFe0.7Ni0.3O3 (Comparative example)<br>
5.3 g of La(NO3)3, 4.7 g of Fe(NO3)3, 1.4 g of Ni(NO3)2 are dissolved in 300 ml of distilled water and slowly dropped in a solution containing 7.7 g of citric acid dissolved in 400 ml of ethylene glycol. After mixing, the resulting solution is heated at 90°C for 4 h. The evaporation of water from the solution brings to the formation of a sol (colloidal solution with micrometric micelles). The catalyst is dried in oven at 90°C then the oven temperature is increased to 180°C over night. In this step, a gel is formed and dried.

5.3 g of La(NO3)3, 6.3 g of Fe(NO3)3, and 0.84 g of Rh nitrate solution 10% w/w are dissolved in 300 ml of distilled water and slowly dropped in a solution containing 7.7 g of citric acid dissolved in 400 ml of ethylene glycol. After mixing, the resulting solution is heated at 90°C for 4 h. The evaporation of water from the solution brings to the formation of a sol (colloidal solution with micrometric micelles). The catalyst is dried in oven at 90°C then the oven temperature is increased to 180°C over night. In this step, a gel is and dried. The solid obtained is calcined at 500°C for 4 h and then at 900°C for 12 h. The XRD shows the perovskite cubic pattern (Figure 1) and the surface area after calcination is 5 m2/g.<br>
Example 5:  La0.8Ce0.2Fe0.7Ni0.3O3 (Invention)<br>
4.3 g of La(NO3)3, 1.4 g Ce(NO3)3, 4.6 g of Fe(NO3)3, 1.4 g of Ni(NO3)2 are dissolved in<br><br>
400 ml of distilled water and slowly dropped in a solution containing 9.5 g of citric acid dissolved in 500 ml of ethylene glycol. After mixing, the resulting solution is heated at 90°C for 4 h. The evaporation of water from the solution brings to the formation of a sol (colloidal solution with micrometric micelles). The catalyst is dried in oven at 90°C then the oven temperature is increased to 180°C over night. In this step, a gel is formed and dried. The solid obtained is calcined at 500°C for 4 h and then at 900°C for 12h. The XRD shows the perovskite cubic pattern and the reflection of the Ce02 phase (Figure 2). The surface area after calcination is 10 m2/g.<br>
The same CPO material can be obtained by solid state reaction. The precursors chosen are La203, Fe203, Ce2(C03)3,xH20 and 2NiC03,3Ni(0H)2,4H20. The oxides and carbonates are ball mixed during one hours in alcohol or water. After drying at 50 °C the mixture is calcined at 900 °C during 12 hr. The XRD shows the perovskite cubic pattern and the reflection of the Ce02 phase (Figure 2). The surface area after calcination is less than 5 m2/g. The powder could be attrited after calcination to increase the surface area around 8-10 m2/g.<br>
Example 6<br>
The catalyst of the example 2 was analysed by XRD after reaction and after calcination at 1100°C and reaction (Figure 3). Figure 3 discloses XRD patterns of Lao.8Ceo.2Feo.7Nio.25Rho.o503 catalysts after calcination at 900°C and 1100°C (fresh C9 and Cll) before reaction and after CPO tests (used C9 and Cll) / (+) AB03 perovskite structure, (*) CeO2 compound. The XRD reported show that the calcined at 1100°C and the reaction does not change the phase composition. In all cases the perovskite structure and a CeO2 side phase are detected. These analyses confirm the stability of the catalyst at high temperature (&gt; 1000 °C) and in hard reaction conditions. The catalyst does not show the Ni and Rh crystal due to the dispersion of the metals on the catalyst surface.<br>
Results<br>
After reduction of the catalysts under a mixture of N2 and H2 at 750 °C / 1 hr, the materials were tested in CPO reactions. The reduction is useful to have immediately the catalyst in its maximum of activity without waiting for stabilisation and to avoid that part<br>
of the catalyst is still oxidised. This activation period (time during which the active phase will be form under reductive conditions) could also be obtained under time on stream with the initial mixture methane/oxygen.<br>
The tests were carried out in a fixed bed quartz microreactor of 8 mm of diameter, loaded with 1.50 g in granules (20-30 mesh). The tests were carried out at atmospheric pressure in three different conditions of feed and two different oven temperature : methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/20 and 2/1/4 v/v at 500°C and 750°C (residence time = 0.2 s) and methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/1 at 750°C (residence time = 0.33 s). The reaction products were analysed by gas chromatography. All the catalyst in all the conditions shows total oxygen conversion. The initial temperature is the temperature of the gas mixture at the beginning of the catalytic bed. The temperature maximal (Tmax) is the temperature measured at the end of the catalytic bed.<br>
CPO tests of LaFe<br>
  (Example 1)<br>
The catalyst prepared in the example 1, LaFe0.7Ni0.25Rh0.05O3, is tested under CPO conditions. At low temperature the catalyst behaviour leads to the total combustion products. The methane conversion and the CO and H2 is high at high temperature (750°C) since the catalyst requires high temperature to be activated.<br>
The test were carried out using methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/20 and 2/1/4 v/v at 500°C and 750°C with residence time of 0.2 s, and methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/1 at 750 °C with a residence time of 0.33 s.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
1 at low temperature in diluted conditions but is higher also in hard reaction conditions.<br>
This is due to the effects of the Ce which promotes the reduction of the catalyst.<br>
The test were carried out using methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/20 and 2/1/4 v/v at 500°C and<br>
750°C with residence time of 0.2 s, and methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/1 at 750°C with a<br>
residence time of 0.33 s.<br>
No deactivation of the catalyst is observed after return to initial conditions (500°C, 2/1/20).<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
*500°C ret. is a test carried out at 500°C 2/1/20 to confirm the result of the first test after all the test<br>
CPO tests of LaFeo.7Nio.3O3 (Example 3, as comparison)<br>
The catalyst prepared in the example 3 LaFeo.7Nio.3O3. This catalyst shows low activity at low and high temperature due to the not complete reduction of the Ni. The test were carried out using methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/20 and 2/1/4 v/v at 500°C and 750°C with residence time of 0.2 s, and methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/1 at 750°C with a residence time of 0.33 s.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
CPO tests of LaFeo.95Rho.05O3 (example 4 as comparison)<br>
The catalyst prepared in the example 4, LaFeo.95Rho.05O3. The catalyst shows a methane conversion and CO and H2 selectivities very low in all reaction conditions. This is due to<br><br>
the fact that the catalyst is not reduced during the activation step in hydrogen flow or in the reaction conditions (methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/20 and 2/1/4 v/v at 500°C and 750°C (residence time = 0.2 s) and methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/1 at 750°C (residence time = 0.33 s).<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Aging CPO tests of  La (Example 2)<br>
The catalytic results of duration tests of the catalyst prepared as in example 2 ( La are reported in figure 4. Figure 4 discloses CPO tests (conversion, selectivity) of  catalyst under time on stream at 500 and 750 °C. The test were carried out using methane/oxygen/helium 2/1/20 and 2/1/4 v/v at 500°C and 750°C with respectively residence time of 0.2 s.<br>
In all cases no deactivation are observed under time on stream. At 750°C the methane conversion is around 90 %, the CO and hydrogen selectivities respectively 94 and 92 %. The results were compared with those of a commercial catalysts Pt 0.5%wt on alfa AI2O3 calcined at 900°C (0.5 % wt Pt/a-Al203). The results of the duration tests of the commercial catalyst are carried out in the same conditions of the CPO tests of Lao.8Ceo.2Feo.7Nio.25Rho.05O3. The comparisons between the two catalysts are described in the next table. The perovskite CPO material presents the same performances and stability as the commercial product.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The advantages of the perovskite catalysts are the thermal stability in hard reaction conditions the high activity at short residence time and the presence of synergetic effect among Rh and Ni.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
