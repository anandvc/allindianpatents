A PROCESS FOR STORING ENRICHED NEMATODES<br>
FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to aquaculture and, more particularly, to a method for "off-the-shelf storage of enriched nematodes used in feeding aquaculture organisms such as fish and shrimp larvae,<br>
A major bottleneck to the successful growing of marine fish with commercial potential is the rearing of the early developmental stages or larvae. During this time, mortality can range from about 60-100%, frequently due to insufficient or poor nutrition. For instance, hatcheries depend on the provision of live food or zooplankton to the large such as rotifers {Brachionus plicatilis or other Brachiamis sp.) and brine shrimp {Artemia sp.). These zooplankters do not represent the natural diet but are relatively easy to grow in large quantities and are readily accepted by the larvae. On the other hand, the culture of these zooplankters requires a considerable investment in infrastructure (tanks, water and air pumps, water treatment) as well as energy and manpower. Moreover, the live food cannot be stored or is deficient in specific long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which are necessary in the diet for rapidly growing larvae which can demonstrate daily a relative growth rate (RGR) of 25-50% (Koven, W., Tandler, A., Kissil, G.Wm., Sklan, D. 1992 The Importance of n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids for growth in larval Spanis atirata and their effect on survival, lipid composition and size distribution. Aquaculture 104, 91-104). This is also true with arachidonic acid (ArA) which has recently been recognized as playing a central role in increasing stress resistance (Koven, W., Barr, Y., Lutzky, S., Ben-Atia. L, Weiss, R,, Harel, M., Behrens, P., Tandler, A. 2001, The effect of arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) on growth, survival and resistance to handling stress in gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata) larvae. Aquaculture 193,  107-122). Consequently, rotifers and Artemia must be enriched with these<br><br>
PUFA, by feeding them commercial DHA and EPA preparations, before they are offered to the fish larvae.<br>
Live food culture systems are frequently plagued by an inconsistent supply of zooplankters that have variable nutritional content and are susceptible to sudden population crashes. So for instance an interruption in the ^supply and/or an inconsistency in feed quality of food fed to the larvae can severely reduce their growth rate, extending the residence time in the hatchery or resulting in smaller, less robust larvae being transferred to the nursery, resulting in reduced growth and survival. In addition, poor feeding can cause stress, resulting in a decreased resistance to disease. In recent years, primarily due to over exploitation, there has been a rapid decline in the world wide availability of Artemia cysts resulting in fluctuating prices and reduced cyst quality compounding the problems of providing these zooplankters.<br>
A clear advantage in the use of nematodes as a feed is in that the nematodes can be stored in a dormant-desiccated state, after enrichment. Tliey can be encapsulated and revived at a later stage for feeding to larvae. This "off the shelf convenience" provides a dependable and nutritionally consistent food supply to the larvae that can be provided, with less investment, than other conventional live food species.<br>
Essential fatty acids for marine larvae such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) can be provided to the nematodes through various oil emulsions. Previous studies have shown that nematodes readily filter the micelles of oil emulsions. Recent studies have shown that the use of liposomes to feed nematodes is a promising<br><br>
approach to widen the range of feeding additives that could be used for enrichment. Liposomes are small (0.025-1 µm) lipid vesicles consisting of an aqueous volume surrounded by a bi-lamellar phospholipid membrane. It is relatively easy to incorporate water-soluble vitamins, minerals, proteins and amino acids into the aqueous volume and/or lipid-soluble nutrients such as<br><br>
lipids, vitamins and pigments into the liposome's phospholipid membrane (Koven, W,, Barr, Y., Hadas, E., Ben-Atia, I., Chen, Y., Weiss, R., Tandler, A. 1999. Tlie potential of liposomes as a nutrient supplement in first-feeding marine fish larvae. Aquaculture Nutrition 5, 251-256).<br>
A recent study showed that liposomes could be used to enrich Artemia nauplii with the free amino acid methionine (Tonheim, S.K., Koven, B, Rlnnestad, I. 2000. Enrichment of Artemia witli free methionine. Aquaculture 190, 223-235). This zooplankter is generally deficient in this amino acid and its enricliment may contribute to more efficient protein synthesis, lliis approach has recently been expanded to include the enrichment of nematodes with this and other free amino acids as well as free fatty acids, which stimulate digestive hormones in the larvae such as cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK is a major factor in the release of pancreatic enzymes resulting in enhanced digestion and assimilation of dietary nutrients. In addition, liposomes fed to nematodes containing immunostimulants, vaccines and other pharmaceuticals may stimulate disease and stress resistance in the larvae resulting in improved larval and juvenile fish quality. -<br>
US Pat. No. 5183950 to Popiel et al teaches a method for commercial storage and shipment of entemogenous (parasitic to insects) nematodes. It relates to methods to desiccate, package, store, and ship insect parasitic nematodes in both large and small quantities while maintaining their viability and pathogenicity to insects. Popiel's method does not mention enriching the nematodes before storage.<br>
US Pat. No. 5042427 to Bedding describes a method of storing and transporting enteropathogenic nematodes by using clay to dry the nematodes, which are revived when dispersed in water. Bedding's method does not mention enriching the nematodes before storage.<br>
Desiccation of nematodes is also taught by Solomon et al. (Solomon A., Papema L, Glazer I.  1999 Desiccation survival of the entomopathogenic<br><br>
nematode Steinemema feltiae: induction of anhydrobiosis Nematology 1 (1), 61-68) as well as by Perry (Perry R. 1999 Desiccation survival of parasitic nematodes. Parasitology 119,S19-S30). Here again there is no mention of enriching the nematodes before desiccation.<br>
WWO Pat. No. 95/18527 to Agricultural Genetics Company LTD teaches enriching nematodes with various additives such as various oils and pigments for use as live feed for larvae. This method illustrates the advantages of feeding enriched nematodes to larvae but there is no mention of long term storage of the nematodes.<br>
The free living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C elegans) has been used as a model genetic organism and has been the subject of intensive molecular and genetic analysis (Jorgensen EM., and Mango SE. 2002 The art and design of genetic screens: Caenorhabditis elegans. Nature Reviews Genetics 3: 356-369; The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium. 1998"Genome sequence of the nematode C. elegans: a platform for investigating biology. Science 282: 2012- 2018; Riddle D.L., Blumenthal, T., Meyer, BJ., and Priess, JR. C elegans 'II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1997.) There has not been however any mention of enrichment, preser\"ation or storage of C. elegans for off the shelf use in aquaculture.<br>
There is thus a widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a process for preserving and storing nematodes having an increased feeding value devoid of the above limitations.<br>

Among the advantages of off-the shelf convenience are:<br>
a)	The ability to store enriched nematodes ensures constant food supply for<br>
the larvae. Due to the rapid daily larval growth rate (RGR of 25-50%), the<br>
interruption of food supply, as a result of equipment failure, crashes in rotifer<br>
and algal cultures and lower hatching rates in poor quality Artemia cysts, can<br>
translate into less than optimal larval growth and survival.<br>
b)	As batches of enriched nematodes can be tested for nutrient content before storage, consistent nutritional quality can be ensured before feeding larvae.<br>
c)	The ability to produce a product for storage, means that sufficient reserves can be built up. This is advantageous otherwise further investment in infrastructure, labor and energy as compared to any other traditional food supply method will be necessary.<br><br>
d)	The ability to store enriched nematodes is a basis for a commercial product that could compete with Artemia cysts, which is a resource plagued by dwindling supply, variable quality, occasional contamination with pesticides fluctuating high prices, and is a non-sustainable resource.	; T<br>
e)	Newly hatched Artemia's body composition can reflect only natural processes in the environment in which the Artemia broodstock dwelled. Cyst laying, being a natural process, lends NO control over quality of the hatched nauplii, in terms of body composition. On the other hand nematodes, which address the same size larvae, can be enriched prior to their encapsulation for long term storage.<br>
The present invention successfully addresses the shortcomings of the presently known configurations by providing a process for preserving and<br><br>
storing nematodes having an increased nutritional value for later use as needed in the feeding of aquaculture organisms.<br>

The present invention is of a method of aquaculture, which can be used for feeding larvae. Specifically, the present invention can be used to preserve and store enriched desiccated nematodes so that they may be taken "off the shelf, be rehydrated and revived for use as needed. Tliis method omits the need for live aquaculture feed such as Artemia, rotifers , copepods etc.<br>
The principles and operation of a method of aquaculture, according to the present invention, may be better understood with reference to the drawing and accompanying descriptions.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details<br><br>
of construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawing. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term "nematode" refers to all types of nematodes. Although the methods of the present invention are practicable with all nematodes, they are preferably practiced with free-living (i.e. non-parasitic) nematodes, more preferably with the species Panagrellus as well as C elegans.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term "desiccation" refers to removal of water from an organism by evaporation, by osmotic pressure or by any other means serving this purpose.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the tenn "aquaculture" refers to the rearing and propagation of any aquatic organism.<br>
For purposes of this specification and the accompanying claims, the term "enrich" refers to substances provided to nematodes via their diet, medium or otherwise, to increase the level of the respected substance in the nematode body prior to feeding it to the target organism and may include but are not restricted to essential fatty acids, vaccines, hormones, immunostimulants, attractants, nutrients or pigments.<br>
Referring now to the drawing, Figure 1 is a flow chart illustrating method 10 for preserving nematodes having an increased feeding value. Method 10 includes the step of culturing nematodes 12. Nematode culturing is known to those skilled in the art of nematology. Nematodes may be fed with yeasts and bacteria acting as mediators for delivering food to the nematodes. Alternately, or additionally, nematodes may be grown on an industrial scale with the use of fermentors.<br>
According to method 10 of the present invention, nematodes are "enriched" with aquaculture feed additives 14 just prior to or alternately after<br><br>
harvest. The nematodes are enriched with at least one additive such as essential fatty acids, vaccines, hormones, immunostimulants, attractants, nutrients or pigments, which is added to the feed of the nematodes. A mediator that has been successfully used for feeding the additives to the nematodes is by penetrating the additives to liposomes and then feeding the liposomes to the nematodes. Essential fatty acids for marine larvae such as docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) and arachidonic acid (20:4n-6) can be provided to the nematodes through various oil emulsions. In addition liposomes, containing immunostimulants and vaccines, can be fed to nematodes, which may improve disease resistance in the larvae feeding on them. Moreover, nematodes can be fed liposomes containing specific free amino (FAA) and fatty acids (FFA) that stimulate digestive hormones in the larvae such as cholecystokinin (CCK). CCK is a major factor in the release of pancreatic enzymes resulting in enhanced digestion and assimilation of dietary nutrients. Other FAA can be incorporated in liposomes to stimulate appetite or to improve larval protein synthesis by giving a more balanced amino acid composition.<br>
In alternative preferred embodiments, enrichment of nematodes with aquaculture feed additives (14) is accomplished by a different approach. In these preferred embodiments, enrichment is accomplished by genetic manipulation of the nematode genome. Such an approach is most easily facilitated using a nematode such as the well studied nematode C. elegans. The genome of C. elegans has been fully sequenced (The C. elegans Sequencing Consortium. 1998 Genome sequence of the nematode C elegans: a platform for investigating biology. Science 282: 2012- 2018). Using standard molecular biological techniques various genes and gene sequences in C elegans can be manipulated (including both regulatory elements and structural genes) to increase the expression of various nutrient compounds and components intrinsic to the species. Altematively new genetic sequences can be introduced into the nematode genome to enrich the nutritional content of the nematode or to<br><br>
produce other biopharmaceutical type compounds, including, but not limited to, essential fatty acids, vaccines, hormones, growth factors, immunostimulants, attractants, nutrients or pigments.<br>
Introduction of genetic material can utilize various techniques for producing transgenic nematodes including, as non-limiting examples,' target selected mutagenesis and manipulation and mobilization of known transposable elements (e.g., Tel) as well as various standard techniques for gene introduction into C. elegans including microinjection (Riddle D.L., Blumenthal, T., Meyer, BJ., and Priess, JR. C. elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1997.).<br>
Transgenic lines of C. elegans are generated by transformation of C elegans with exogenous DNA by microinjection of vectors carrying DNA sequences into the syncitial ovaries of adult hermaphrodites. The injected DNA forms multimerized tandem arrays of microinjected DNA carried either . as semi-stable extrachromosomal arrays, or integrated into a host chromosome, forming a stable integrated transgenic line. By including appropriate genetic markers with the injected DNA, one can identify animals that carry the transgene. . Sometimes chromosomal integration of the introduced DNA can occur, or an existing extrachromosomal array can be integrated after irradiation of a transgenic line. See Riddle D.L., Blumenthal, T., Meyer, BJ., and Priess, JR. C elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York, 1997; Hashmi, S., G. Hashmi &amp; R. Gaugler. 1995.

After feeding the nematodes with the enriching additive, the enriched nematodes are ready for feeding to the breeding larvae or are desiccated 16 for future "off-the-shelf use. Several prior methods of desiccation are discussed above in the introduction and are known to those skilled in the art of nematology. A preferred method of desiccation is performed by inducing a quiescent anhydrobiosis or osmobiosis. Aniiydrobiosis/osmobiosis or dehydration of the nematodes is optimally a quiescent anhydrobiosis. Quiescence is a spontaneous reversible response to unpredictable unfavorable environmental conditions and release from quiescence occurs when favorable conditions return. The desiccated and enriched nematodes are then stored 18 and are available in a dehydrated state for use as needed at a future date.<br>
In alternative preferred embodiments of the method of the present invention, in place of dessication (16), other tecliniques for preserving enriched nematodes can be employed. For example, after enrichment, the enriched nematodes may be preserved for future "off-the-shelf use by lowering the temperature of the enriched nematodes to stop or reduce significantly the metabolism of the enriched nematodes. Prior to use, the nematodes can be restored and revived by raising the temperature of the preserved nematodes to a normal temeperature.<br>
Figure 1 further illustrates an improved method 10 of aquaculture. The method includes the step of culturing nematodes 12. Nematode culturmg is known to those skilled in the art of nematology. Nematodes may be fed with yeasts and bacteria acting as mediators for delivermg food to the nematodes. Alternately, or additionally, nematodes may be grown on an industrial scale with the use of fermentors.<br>
According to method 10 of the present invention, after a period of time, before harvesting or altemately after harvestmg, the nematodes are enriched<br><br>
with aquaculture feed additives 14. A novel means of incorporating feed additives into the nematodes is by using a mediator. A mediator which has been successfully used for feeding the feed additives to the nematodes are liposomes which contain feed additives. Alternately, or additionally, other mediators can be utilized for this purpose.<br>
After feeding the nematodes with the enriching additive, the enriched nematodes are ready for feeding to the breeding larvae or" are desiccated 16 for future use.. Several prior methods of desiccation are discussed above in the introduction and are known to those skilled in the art of nematology. The desiccated enriched nematodes are then stored 18 and are available in a dehydrated state for off-the shelf use at a future date.<br>
Before use, the desiccated enriched nematodes are rehydrated and revived 20. Following rehydration, the rehydrated enriched nematodes are fed to an organism being grown in aquaculture 22.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention nematodes which have been cultured are desiccated and then stored. Prior to use the desiccated nematodes are rehydrated and revived and then the nematodes are enriched with feed additives and then fed to an organism being grown in the agriculture.<br>
In altemative preferred embodiments of the present invention, enrichment of nematodes with aquaculture feed additives (14) prior to preservation is accomplished by genetic manipulation of the nematode genome, as described hereinabove. In further altemative embodiments, in place of dessication, the enriched nematodes are preserved by lowering the temperature of the enriched nematodes to stop or reduce significantly the metabolism of the enriched nematodes. Prior to use, the nematodes can be restored and revived by raising the temperature of the preserved nematodes to a normal temperature, and then fed to an organism being grown in the aquaculture.<br>
