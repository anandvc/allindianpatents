HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf, and HCFC-244bb are available from<br>
specialty chemical manufacturers, including SynQuest Laboratories, Inc.<br>
(Alachua, FL, U.S.A.) or may be made as described herein. For instance,<br>
HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf, and HCFC-244bb may be prepared by noncatalytic<br>
chlorination of HFO-1243zf, as described in International Patent<br>
Application Publication No. WO2008/054782, published May 8, 2008.<br>
Also, HCFO-1233xf and HCFC-244bb may be prepared by catalytic<br>
fluorination of 243db as described in Intemational Patent Application<br>
Publication No. WO2008/054781, published May 8, 2008. The additional<br>
compounds present in each disclosed composition will depend upon the<br>
method of manufacture.<br>
In some embodiments, certain precursor compounds to HCFC-<br>
243db, HCFO-1233xf, or HCFC-244bb contain impurities that then appear<br>
as additional compounds in the described compositions. In other<br>
embodiments, these precursor compounds may themselves react during<br>
the 243db formation to form additional compounds that then appear in the<br>
HCFC-243db compositions. In other embodiments, the reaction conditions<br>
under which the HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf, or HCFC-244bb are<br>
produced also produce by-products, by which is meant adventitious<br>
reaction pathways may occur simultaneously to produce compounds other<br>
than HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf or HCFC-244bb and the quantity and<br>
identity of these additional compounds will depend upon the particular<br>
conditions under which the HCFC-243db, HCFO-1233xf or HCFC-244bb<br>
are produced.<br>
In one embodiment, HFO-1234yf may be produced in a single step<br>
from HCFC-243db. In another embodiment, the reaction sequence may<br>
O<br>
be carried out in a step-wise manner. In another embodiment, HCFO-<br>
1233xf may be produced from HCFC-243db and then HCFO-1233xf may<br>
be converted directly to HFO-1234yf. In yet another embodiment, HCFC-<br>
244bb may be produced from HCFC-243db and then the HCFC-244bb<br>
may be converted to HFO-1234yf,<br>
Fluorochlorination of HFO-1243zf<br>
In some embodiments, HFO-1243rf may be used to make HCFC-<br>
243db, HCFO-1233xf, HCFC-244db, and/or HFO-1234yf by<br>
fluorochlorination. HFO-1243zf is commercially available from E.I. DuPont<br>
de Nemours and Company (Wilmington, DE, USA).<br>
The fluorochlorination reaction may be carried out in the liquid or<br>
vapor phase. For liquid phase embodiments of the invention, the reaction<br>
of HFO-1243zf with HF and CI2 may be conducted in a liquid-phase<br>
reactor operating in batch, semi-batch, semi-continuous, or continuous<br>
modes. In the batch mode, HFO-1243zf, CI2, and HF are combined in an<br>
autoclave or other suitable reaction vessel and heated to the desired<br>
temperature.<br>
In one embodiment, this reaction is carried out in semi-batch mode<br>
by feeding CI2 to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF and HFO-1243zf or<br>
by feeding HFO-1243zf and CI2 to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF, or<br>
by feeding CI2 to a mixture containing HF and reaction products formed by<br>
initially heating HFO-1243zf and HF. In another embodiment, HF and CI2<br>
may be fed to a liquid-phase reactor containing a mixture of HFO-1243zf<br>
and reaction products formed by reacting HF, CI2, and HFO-1243zf. In<br>
another embodiment of the liquid-phase process, HF, CI2, and HFO-<br>
1243zf may be fed concurrently in the desired stoichiometric ratio to the<br>
reactor containing a mixture of HF and reaction products formed by<br>
reacting HF, CI2, and HFO-1243zf.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the reaction of HF and CI2 with HFO-<br>
1243zf in the liquid-phase reactor are, in one embodiment, from about<br>
SOX to about 180°C, and in another embodiment, from about 100°C to<br>
labout 150°C. Higher temperatures typically result in greater conversion of<br>
theHFO-1243zf.<br>
A suitable molar ratio of HF to total amount of HFO-12432f fed to<br>
the liquid-phase reactor is, in one embodiment, at least stoichiometric and<br>
in another embodiment, is from about 5:1 to about 100:1. Of note are<br>
embodiments wherein the molar ratio of HF to HFO-12432f is from about<br>
8:1 to about 50:1. A suitable molar ratio of CI2 to total amount of HFO-<br>
1243zf fed to the liquid-phase reactor is from akx)ut 1:1 to about 2:1.<br>
The reactor pressure in the liquid-phase process is not critical and<br>
in batch reactions is usually the autogenous pressure of the system at the<br>
reaction temperature. The pressure of the system increases as hydrogen<br>
chloride is formed by replacement of hydrogen substituents by chlorine,<br>
and by replacement of chlorine substituents by fluorine in the starting<br>
materials and intermediate reaction products. In a continuous process it is<br>
possible to set the pressure of the reactor in such a way that the lower<br>
boiling products of the reaction, such as HCI, HFO-1234yf(CF3CF=CH2),<br>
E<z-1234ze and hfc-245cb are vented></z-1234ze>
from the reactor, optionally through a packed column or condenser. In this<br>
manner, higher boiling intermediates remain in the reactor and the volatile<br>
products are removed. Typical reactor pressures are from about 20 psig<br>
(239 kPa) to about 1,000 psig (6.994 kPa).<br>
In some embodiments, in which the reaction is conducted using a<br>
liquid-phase process, catalysts which may be used include cart)on, AIF3,<br>
BF3, FeCb-aFa (where a = 0 to 3), FeXs supported on carbon, SbCls-aFa,<br>
ASF3, MCls-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M = Sb, Nb, Ta, or Mo), and M'Cl4-cFc<br>
(where c = 0 to 4, and M' = Sn, Ti, Zr, or Hf). In another embodiment,<br>
catalysts for the liquid phase process are MCls-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M<br>
= Sb, Nb, orTa).<br>
In another embodiment, the reaction of HF and CI2 with HFO-<br>
12432f is earned out in the vapor phase. Typically a heated reactor is<br>
used. A number of reactor configurations are possible including horizontal<br>
or vertical orientation of the reactor as well as the sequence of reaction of<br>
7 -<br>
the HFO-1243zf with HF and CI2. In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
HFO-1243zf may be initially vaporized and fed to the reactor as a gas.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, HFO-1243zf may be<br>
contacted with HF, optionally in the presence of CI2, in a pre-reactor prior<br>
to reaction in the vapor-phase reactor. In one embodiment, the prereactor<br>
may be empty. In another embodiment, the reactor is filled with a<br>
suitable packing such as nickel-copper alloys commercially available from<br>
Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New York) under the trademark<br>
Monel®, (hereinafter "Monel®") nickel-based alloys commercially available<br>
from Haynes International (Kokomo, Indiana) under the trademark<br>
Hastelloy®, (hereinafter "Hastelloy®") or other nickel alloy turnings or wool,<br>
or other material inert to HCI and HF which allows efficient mixing of HFO-<br>
1243zfand HF vapor.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the pre-reactor in one embodiment are<br>
from about 80°C to about 250'C, in another embodiment, from about<br>
100°C to about 200X. Temperatures greater than about lOO'C result in<br>
some conversion of the HFO-1243zf to compounds having a higher<br>
degree of fluorination. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of<br>
the HFO-1243zf entering the reactor and a greater degree of fluorination in<br>
the converted compounds. Under these conditions, for example, a mixture<br>
of HF, CI2, and HFO-1243zf is converted to a mixture containing<br>
predominantly HCFC-243db and HGFC-244db (CF3CHCICH2F).<br>
The degree of fluorination reflects the number of fluorine<br>
substituents that replace chlorine substituents in the HFO-1243zf and their<br>
chlorinated products. For example, HCFC-253fb represents a higher<br>
degree of fluorination than HCC-250fb and HFO-1243zf represents a<br>
higher degree of fluorination than HCO-1240zf.<br>
The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1243zf in the prereactor<br>
is in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio of HF to<br>
the total amount of HFO-1243zf to about 50:1. In another embodiment,<br>
the molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1243zf in the pre-reactor<br>
is from about twice the stoichiometric ratio of HF to the total amount of<br>
HFO-1243zf to about 30:1. In another embodiment, the molar ratio of HF<br>
13<br>
to the total amount of HFO-1243zf is present in the pre-reactor, and no<br>
additional amount of HF is added to the vapor-phase reaction zone.<br>
In another embodiment, the HFO-1243zf may be contacted with Cb<br>
in a pre-reactor, optionally in the presence of HF, prior to reaction in the<br>
vapor-phase reactor.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the pre-reactor for this embodiment of the<br>
invention are from about SO'C to about 250°C, preferably from about<br>
100°C to about 200°C. Under these conditions, at least a portion of HFO-<br>
1243zf is converted to HCFC-243db. Higher temperatures typically result<br>
in a higher degree of halogenation of the HFO-1243zf.<br>
The degree of halogenation reflects the total number of halogen<br>
substituents (chlorine plus fluorine) in a halopropane and/or halopropene<br>
product. For example, HFO-1234yf has a higher degree of halogenation<br>
(i.e., 4) than does HFO-1243zf (i.e., 3).<br>
The molar ratio of GI2 to the total amount of HFO-1243zf is, in one<br>
embodiment, from about 0.5:1 to about 2:1. In another embodiment, the<br>
molar ratio of CI2 to the total amount of the HFO-12432f is from about 1.1:1<br>
to about 1:1.<br>
In one embodiment, the HFO-1243zf is vaporized, optionally in the<br>
presence of HF, and fed to a pre-reactor or to a vapor-phase reactor along<br>
with HF and CI2.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the vapor-phase reaction are from about<br>
120°C to about 500°C. Temperatures of from about 250°C to about<br>
350°G favor the fomnation of HFO-1234yf and HFC-245cb. Temperatures<br>
of from about 350°C to about 450°C favor the formation of HFO-1234ze,<br>
HFC-245fa, and HCFO-1233zd. At temperatures of from about 250°C to<br>
about 450°C, some HCFO-1233xf is also produced. Higher temperatures<br>
result in greater conversion of HFO-1243zf and higher degrees of<br>
fluorination and halogenation in the converted compounds.<br>
Suitable reactor pressures for the vapor-phase reactor may be from<br>
about 1 to about 30 atmospheres. A pressure of about 15 to about 25<br>
atmospheres may be advantageously employed to facilitate separation of<br>
HCI from other reaction products, and the suitable reaction time may vary<br>
11<br>
from about 1 to about 120 seconds, preferably from about 5 to about 60<br>
seconds.<br>
The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1243zf for the<br>
vapor-phase reaction is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric<br>
ratio of HF to the total amount of HFO-1243zf to about 50:1 and, in<br>
another embodiment, from about 10:1 to about 30:1.<br>
In one embodiment, a catalyst is used in the reaction zone for the<br>
vapor-phase reaction of HF and Clzwith HFO-1243zf. Chlorofluorination<br>
catalysts which may be used in the vapor phase reaction include carbon;<br>
graphite; alumina; fluorided alumina; aluminum fluoride; alumina<br>
supported on carbon; aluminum fluoride supported on carbon; fluorided<br>
alumina supported on carbon; magnesium fluoride supported on aluminum<br>
fluoride; metals (including elemental metals, metal oxides, metal halides,<br>
and/or other metal salts); metals supported on aluminum fluoride; metals<br>

titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, copper, silver, gold, zinc, and/or metals<br>
having an atomic number of 58 through 71 (i.e., the lanthanide metals). In<br>
one embodiment, when used on a support, the total metal content of the<br>
catalyst will be from about 0.1 to about 20 percent by weight based on the<br>
total weight of the catalyst; in another embodiment from about 0.1 to about<br>
10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst.<br>
Suitable chlorofluorination catalysts for the vapor-phase reactions<br>
include chromium-containing catalysts including chromium(lll) oxide<br>
(Cr203); CrzOswith other metals such as magnesium halides or zinc<br>

oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally supported on<br>
graphite; and mixtures of chromium and other metals (including elemental<br>
metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally<br>
supported on graphite, alumina, or aluminum halides such as aluminum<br>
fluoride.<br>
Chromium-containing catalysts are well known in the art. They may<br>
be prepared by either precipitation methods or impregnation methods as<br>
generally described by Satterfieid on pages 87-112 in Heterogeneous<br>
Catalysis in Industrial Practice, 2"^ edition (McGraw-Hill, New York, 1991).<br>
Of note are chlorofluorination catalysts that comprise at least one<br>
chromium-containing component selected from the group consisting of<br>
crystalline alpha-chromium oxide where from about 0.05 atom % to about<br>
6 atom % of the chromium atoms in the alpha-chromium oxide lattice are<br>

including their preparation, have been disclosed in U. S. Patent<br>
Application Publication US2005/0228202.<br>
Optionally, the metal-containing catalysts described above can be<br>
pretreated with HF. This pretreatment can be accomplished, for example,<br>
by placing the metal-containing catalyst in a suitable container, and<br>
thereafter, passing HF over the metal-containing catalyst. In one<br>
embodiment, such container can be the reactor used to perform the<br>
chlorofluorination reaction. In one embodiment, the pretreatment time is<br>
from about 15 to about 300 minutes, and the pretreatment temperature is<br>
from about 200'C to about 450'C.<br>

Fluorination of HCFC-243db<br>
In some embodiments, HCFC-243db may be used to make HCFCHCFO-<br>
1233xf, HCFC-244db, and/or HFO-1234yf by fluorination. These<br>
reactions are shown in FIG. 1. The fluorination reaction may be carried<br>
out in the liquid or vapor phase. For liquid phase embodiments of the<br>
invention, the reaction of HCFC-243db with HF may be conducted in a<br>
liquid-phase reactor operating in batch, semi-batch, semi-continuous, or<br>
continuous modes. In the batch mode, starting HCFC-243db and HF are<br>
17<br>
combined in an autoclave or other suitable reaction vessel and heated to<br>
the desired temperature.<br>
In one embodiment, this reaction is carried out in semi-batch mode<br>
by feeding HF to a liquid-phase reactor containing HCFC-243db or by<br>
feeding HCFC-243db to a liquid-phase reactor containing HF, or by<br>
feeding HF to a mixture containing HF and reaction products formed by<br>
initially heating HCFC-243db and HF. In another embodiment, HF may be<br>
fed to a liquid-phase reactor containing a mixture of HCFC-243db and<br>
reaction products formed by the reaction of HF, and HCFC-243db. In<br>
another embodiment of the liquid-phase process, HF, and HCFC-243db<br>
may be fed concurrently in the desired stoichiometric ratio to the reactor<br>
containing a mixture of HF and reaction products formed by reacting HF,<br>
and HCFC-243db.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the reaction of HF with HCFC-243db in<br>
the liquid-phase reactor are, in one embodiment, from about SCC to about<br>
180°C, in another embodiment, from about 100°C to about 150°C. Higher<br>
temperatures typically result in greater conversion of the HCFC-243db.<br>
A suitable molar ratio of HF to HCFC-243db fed to the liquid-phase<br>
reactor is, in one embodiment, at least stoichiometric and, in another<br>
embodiment, is from about 5:1 to about 100:1. Of note are embodiments<br>
wherein the molar ratio of HF to HCFC-243db is from about 8:1 to about<br>
50:1.<br>
The reactor pressure in the liquid-phase process is not critical and<br>
in batch reactions is usually the autogenous pressure of the system at the<br>
reaction temperature. The pressure of the system increases as hydrogen<br>
chloride is formed by replacement of chlorine substituents by fluorine in<br>
the HCFC-243db and intermediate reaction products. In a continuous<br>
process it is possible to set the pressure of the reactor in such a way that<br>
the lower boiling products of the reaction, such as HCI, CF3CF=CH2, and<br>
E/Z-CF3CH=CHF, are vented from the reactor, optionally through a<br>
pacl<ed column or condenser. in this manner higher boiling intermediates></ed>
remain in the reactor and the volatile products are removed. Typical<br>
reactor pressures are from about 20 psig (239 kPa) to about 1,000 psig<br>
(6,994 kPa).<br>
In embodiments in which the reaction is conducted using a liquidphase<br>
process, catalysts which may be used include carbon, AIF3, BF3,<br>
FeCla-aFa (where a = 0 to 3), FeXa supported on carbon, SbCb-aFg, AsFa,<br>
MCls-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M = Sb, Nb, Ta, or Mo), and M'Cl4^Fc<br>
(where c = 0 to 4, and M' = Sn, Ti, Zr, or Hf). In one embodiment,<br>
catalysts for the liquid phase process are MCls-bFb (where b = 0 to 5 and M<br>
= Sb, Nb, or Ta).<br>
In one embodiment, the reaction of HF with HCFC-243db is carried<br>
out in the vapor phase. Typically a heated reactor is used. A number of<br>
reactor configurations are possible including horizontal or vertical<br>
orientation of the reactor as well as the sequence of reaction of the<br>
starting materials with HF. In one embodiment, the HCFC-243db may be<br>
initially vaporized and fed to the reactor as a gas.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the HCFC-243db may be<br>
contacted with HF in a pre-reactor prior to reaction in the vapor-phase<br>
reactor. The pre-reactor may be empty, but is preferably filled with a<br>
suitable packing such as nickel-copper alloys commercially available from<br>
Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New York) under the trademark<br>
Monel®, nickel-based alloys such as Hastelloy®, or other nickel alloy<br>
turnings or wool, or other material inert to HCI and HF which allows<br>
efficient mixing of HCFC-243db and HF vapor.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the pre-reactor in one embodiment are<br>
from about 80°C to about 250'C, in another embodiment, from about<br>
lOO'C to about 200°C. Temperatures greater than about 100°C result in<br>
some conversion of the HCFC-243db to compounds having a higher<br>
degree of fluorination. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of<br>
the HCFC-243db entering the reactor and a greater degree of fluorination<br>
in the converted compounds. Under these conditions, for example, a<br>
mixture of HF and HCFC-243db is converted to a mixture containing<br>
predominantly HF, HCI, HCFC-243db, HCFC-244db (CF3CHCICH2F), and<br>
HCFO-1233xf.<br>
15'<br>
The degree of fluorination reflects the number of fluorine<br>
substituents that replace chlorine substituents in the HCFC-243db and<br>
their fluorinated products. For example, HFO-1234yf represents a higher<br>
degree of fluorination than HCFO-1233xf.<br>
The molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HCFC-243db in the<br>
pre-reactor is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio of<br>
HF to the total amount of HCFC-243db to about 50:1. In another<br>
embodiment, the molar ratio of HF to the total amount of HCFC-243db in<br>
the pre-reactor is from about twice the stoichiometric ratio of HF to the<br>
total amount of HCFC-243db to about 30:1. In another embodiment, the<br>
molar ratio of HF to the amount of HCFC-243db is present in the prereactor,<br>
and no additional amount of HF is added to the vapor-phase<br>
reaction zone.<br>
In one embodiment, the HCFC-243db and HF are vaporized and<br>
fed to a pre-reactor or to a vapor-phase reactor.<br>
Suitable temperatures for the vapor-phase reaction are from about<br>
120°C to about 500°C. Temperatures in the range of from about 300°C to<br>
about 350°C favor the formation of HFO-1234yf and HFC-245cb and<br>
HCFO-1233xf. Temperatures in the range of from about 350°C to about<br>
450°C favor the additional formation of HFO-1234ze, HFC-245fa, and<br>
HCFO-1233zd. Higher temperatures result in greater conversion of<br>
HCFC-243db and greater degrees of fluorination in the converted<br>
products. Reactor temperatures of from about 150°C to about 275°C<br>
favor the formation of HCFO-1233xf as the major product.<br>
Suitable reactor pressures for the vapor-phase reactor may be from<br>
about 1 to about 30 atmospheres. A pressure of about 15 to about 25<br>
atmospheres may be advantageously employed to facilitate separation of<br>
HCI from other reaction products, and the suitable reaction time may vary<br>
from about 1 to about 120 seconds, preferably from atxjut 5 to about 60<br>
seconds.<br>
The molar ratio of HF to the amount of HCFC-243db for the vaporphase<br>
reaction is, in one embodiment, from about the stoichiometric ratio<br>
2.0<br>
of HF to the amount of HCFC-243db to about 50:1 and, in another<br>
embodiment, from about 10:1 to about 30:1.<br>
In some embodiments, a catalyst is used in the reaction zone for<br>
the vapor-phase reaction of HF with HCFC-243db. Fluorination catalysts<br>
which may be used in the vapor phase reaction include carbon; graphite;<br>
alumina; fluorided alumina; aluminum fluoride; alumina supported on<br>
carbon; aluminum fluoride supported on carbon; fluorided alumina<br>
supported on carbon; magnesium fluoride supported on aluminum fluoride;<br>
metals (including elemental metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or<br>
other metal salts); metals supported on aluminum fluoride; metals<br>
supported on fluorided alumina; metals supported on alumina; and metals<br>
supported on carbon; mixtures of metals.<br>
Suitable metals for use as catalysts (optionally supported on<br>
alumina, aluminum fluoride, fluorided alumina, or carbon) include<br>
chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium,<br>
iridium, platinum, manganese, rhenium, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum,<br>
titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, copper, silver, gold, zinc, and/or metals<br>
having an atomic number of 58 through 71 (i.e., the lanthanide metals). In<br>
some embodiments, when used on a support, the total metal content of<br>
the catalyst will be from about 0.1 to about 20 percent by weight based on<br>
the total weight of the catalyst; in another embodiment, from about 0.1 to<br>
about 10 percent by weight based on the total weight of the catalyst.<br>
Typical fluorination catalysts for the vapor-phase reactions in this<br>
invention include chromium-containing catalysts including chromium(lll)<br>
oxide (Cr203); CraOswith other metals such as magnesium halides or zinc<br>
halides supported on Cr203; chromium(lll) halides supported on carbon;<br>

oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally supported on<br>
graphite; and mixtures of chromium and other metals (including elemental<br>
metals, metal oxides, metal halides, and/or other metal salts) optionally<br>
supported on graphite, alumina, or aluminum halides such as aluminum<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
General Procedure for Product Analysis<br>
The following general procedure is illustrative of the method used<br>
for analyzing the products of fluorination reactions. Part of the total<br>
reactor effluent was sampled on-line for organic product analysis using a<br>
gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector (GC/MS).<br>
The gas chromatography utilized a 20 ft. (6.1 m) long x 1/8 in. (0.32 cm)<br>
diameter tube containing perfluorinated polyether sold under the<br>
trademark Krytox® by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company<br>
^ 5<br>
(hereinafter "DuPont") of Wilmington, Delaware on an inert carbon<br>
support. The helium flow was 30 mUmin (5.0 x 10'^ m3/sec). Gas<br>
chromatographic conditions were 60°C for an initial hold period of<br>
three minutes followed by temperature programming to 200°C at a rate of<br>
6°C/minute.<br>
Preparation of 98%Chromium/2%Cobalt Catalyst<br>
A solution of 784.30 grams Cr(N03)3[9(H20)] (1.96 moles) and<br>
11.64 grams Co(N03)2[6(H20)] (0.040 mole) was prepared in 2000 mL of<br>
deionized water. The solution was treated dropwise with 950 mL of 7.4 M<br>
aqueous ammonia until the pH reached about 8.5. The slurry was stirred<br>
ovemight at room temperature and then evaporated to dryness in air at<br>
110-120'C. The dried catalyst was then calcined in air at 400°C for 24<br>
hours prior to use.<br>

Chlorofluorination of HFO-1243zf<br>
The 98% chromium/2% cobalt catalyst prepared above (21.4<br>
grams, 15 mL, -12 to +20 mesh, (1.68 to 0.84 mm)) was placed in a 5/8"<br>
2^^<br>
(1.58 cm) diameter Inconel® (Special Metals Corp. (New Hartford, New<br>
York)) nickel alloy reactor tube heated in a fluidized sand bath. The<br>
catalyst was pre-fluorinated by treatment with HF as follows. The catalyst<br>
was heated from 45°C to 175°C in a flow of nitrogen (50 cc/min) over the<br>
course of about 1.5 hours. HF was then admitted to the reactor at a flow<br>
rate of 50 cc/min for 1.3 hours at a temperature of 175°C. The reactor<br>
nitrogen flow was decreased to 20 cc/min and the HF flow increased to<br>
80 cc/min; this flow was maintained for 0.3 hour. The reactor temperature<br>
was then gradually increased to 400°C over 1 hour. After this period, the<br>
HF and nitrogen flow was stopped and the reactor brought to the desired<br>
operating temperature. A flow of HF vapor, HFO-1243zf, and CI2 then<br>
started through the reactor. Part of the reactor effluent was analyzed by<br>
on line GC/MS.<br>
The results of the chlorofluorination of HFO-1243zf over the 98/2<br>
Cr/Co catalyst at various operating temperatures and indicated molar<br>
ratios of HF, HFO-1243zf and CI2 are shown in Table 2; analytical data is<br>
given in units of GC area %. The nominal catalyst bed volume was 15 cc;<br>
the contact time (CT) was 15 seconds. Examples 1 and 2 were carried out<br>
in the absence of the catalyst.<br>

EXAMPLE 13<br>
Fluorination of HCFO-1233xf to HCFC-244bb<br>
The contents of a small PTFE vial containing 20 grams of viscous<br>
SbFs were poured into a dry 400 mL Hastelloy® shaker tube. The tube<br>
was closed and was pressurized with nitrogen for leak testing. The shaker<br>
tube was then cooled to less than - 40 °C with dry ice, slowly vented, and<br>
then evacuated. 75 grams (3.75-moles) of anhydrous HF was condensed<br>
into the shaker tube followed by 165 grams (1.26-moles) of HCFO-1233xf.<br>
The shaker tube was placed in a barricade and shaking was started.<br>
The shaker tube was agitated at ambient temperature (~20-23°C)<br>
and the pressure was 21 to 25 psig. After 2 hours, shaking was stopped<br>
and 150 mL of water was carefully pumped into the shaker tube. The tube<br>
was left overnight and then cooled to 0 to 5°C in an ice bath before<br>
depressurization and transferring the contents to a plastic container. The<br>
container was kept on ice.<br>
The container contents were poured into a polypropylene<br>
separatory funnel containing some ice. The lower organic layer was light<br>
amber in appearance. The organic layer was separated into a media<br>
bottle made of a glass sold under the trademark of Pyrex® by Coming<br>
(Lowell, MA) (hereinafter "Pyrex®')containing ~50-mL of 4 molar (pH 7)<br>
phosphate buffer and Ice (~100-mL). The organic layer was again<br>
separated and poured into a dry Pyrex® media bottle containing a small<br>
3 0<br>
annount of anhydrous magnesiunn sulfate. Crude yield was 164.3 grams<br>
(about 120-mL, 86%).<br>
GC/MS of the crude material showed that it was mostly HCFC-<br>
244bb. Other components included 0.13% 245cb, 0.09% 245eb, 0.16%<br>
1233xf, and other byproducts totaling 12.2%.<br>
EXAMPLE 14<br>
Fluorination of HCFO-1233xf to HCFC-244bb<br>
The contents of a small PTFE vial containing 20 grams of viscous<br>
SbFs were poured into a dry 400-mL Hastelloy® shaker tube. The tube<br>
was closed and was pressurized with nitrogen for leak testing. The shaker<br>
tube was then cooled to less than - 40 "C with dry ice, slowly vented, and<br>
then evacuated. 53 grams (2.65 moles) of anhydrous HF was transferred<br>
into the shaker tube followed by 227 grams (1.74 moles) of HCFO-1233xf<br>
was condensed into the chilled shaker tube. The shaker tube was placed<br>
in the barricade and shaking was started.<br>
The shaker tube was agitated at ambient temperature (~18-2rC)<br>
and the pressure was 16 to 20 psig. After 2 hours, shaking was stopped<br>
and 100 mL of water was carefully pumped into the shaker tube. The tube<br>
was left overnight and cooled to 0 to 5°C in an ice bath before venting and<br>
transfenring the contents to a plastic container. The container was kept on<br>
ice.<br>
The container contents were poured into a polypropylene separatory<br>
funnel containing some ice. The lower organic layer was light amber in<br>
appearance. The organic layer was separated into a Pyrex® media bottle<br>
containing about 50 mL of 4 molar (pH 7) phosphate buffer and ice (~100-<br>
mL). The organic layer was again separated and poured into a dry Pyrex®<br>
media bottle containing a small amount of anhydrous magnesium sulfate.<br>
Crude yield was 238.8 grams (about 170-mL, 91%).<br>
GC/MS of the crude material indicated that it was mostly HCFC-<br>
244bb. Other components included 0.11% HFC-245cb, 0.10% HFC-<br>
245eb, 0.26% HCFO-1233xf, and other byproducts totaling 9.7%.<br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Example 15 demonstrates the conversion of HCFC-244bb (2-<br>
chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane) to HFO-1234yf (2,3,3,3-<br>
tetrafluoropropene) in the absence of a catalyst.<br>
An empty Inconel® tube (1/2 inch OD) with a heated zone of about<br>
12 inches was heated to a temperature t)etween 500°C and 626°C, and<br>
HFC-244bb was fed at 0.5? mUhour through a vaporizer set at 40°C using<br>
a N2 sweep of 2.4 seem (4.0 x 10"^ m^). The reactor effluent was analyzed<br>
using an on-line GCIVIS, with the results being reported in mole percent.<br>

32-<br>
m ). The reactor was operated for a total of 19 hours continuously, and<br>
samples were taken periodically and analyzed to determine % conversion<br>
of HFC-244bb, and selectivity to HFO-1234yf. The reactor effluent was<br>
analyzed using an on-line GCMS, and the data in Table 6 below is an<br>
average of at least two on-line injections at a given condition; the<br>
percentages are mole percent.<br>

EXAMPLE 17<br>
Example 17 demonstrates the dehydrochlorination of HCFC-244bb<br>
(2-chloro-1,1,1,2-tetrafluoropropane) in the presence of an activated<br>
carbon catalyst.<br>
An Inconel® tube (1/2 inch OD) was filled with 4 cc (1.99 gm) of acid<br>
washed PCB Polynesian coconut shell based carbon from Calgon (6-10<br>
mesh). HFC-244bb was fed at 1.04 mL/hour through a vaporizer set at<br>
40°C using a N2 sweep of 2.4 seem (4.0 x 10"^ m^) giving a total contact<br>
time of about 32 seconds while controlling the reactor temperature at<br>
400°C.<br>
The data in Table 7 shows the reactor effluent composition in mole<br>
percent for this process run with an activated cart)on catalyst to make<br>
HFC-1234yf via HCI elimination over the period of 7 hours of operation.<br>
