Detailed Description<br>
In the following detailed description of embodiments of the invention,<br>
embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to<br>
practice them, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized<br>
and that chemical and procedural changes may be made without departing from<br>
the spirit and scope of the present subject matter. The following detailed<br>
description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of<br>
embodiments of the present invention is defined only by the appended claims.<br>
The Detailed Description that follows begins with a definition section<br>
followed by a brief overview of cellulosic biomass, a description of the<br>
embodiments, an example section and a brief conclusion.<br>
Definitions<br>
The term "biofuel" or "biomass" as used herein, refers in general to<br>
organic matter harvested or collected as a source of energy. Biofuels are<br>
originally derived from the photosynthesis process and can therefore be<br>
considered a solar energy source. A biofuel is a renewable solid, liquid or<br>
gaseous fuel derived from relatively "recently" dead biological material, i.e.,<br>
5<br>
"biomass," as distinguished from fossil fuels, which are derived from long dead<br>
biological material and are not renewable. There are generally considered to be<br>
three types of biofuels, namely, agricultural biofuels (defined below), municipal<br>
waste biofuels (residential and light commercial garbage or refuse, with most of<br>
the recyclable materials such as glass and metal removed) and forestry biofuels<br>
(e.g., trees, waste or byproduct streams from wood products, wood fiber, pulp<br>
and paper industries). Biomass can further be in the form of solid biomass,<br>
liquid biomass or gaseous biomass.<br>
The term "agricultural biofuel", as used herein, refers to a biofuel<br>
derived from agricultural crops, crop residues, grain processing facility wastes<br>
(e.g., wheat/oat hulls, com/bean fines, out-of-specification materials, etc.),<br>
livestock production facility waste (e.g., manure, carcasses, etc.), livestock<br>
processing facility waste (e.g., undesirable parts, cleansing streams,<br>
contaminated materials, etc.), food processing facility waste (e.g., separated<br>
waste streams such as grease, fat, stems, shells, intermediate process residue,<br>
rinse/cleansing streams, etc.), value-added agricultural facility byproducts (e.g.,<br>
distiller's wet grain (DWG) and syrup from ethanol production facilities, etc.),<br>
and the like. Examples of livestock industries include, but are not limited to,<br>
beef, pork, turkey, chicken, egg and dairy facilities. Examples of agricultural<br>
crops include, but are not limited to, any type of non-woody plant (e.g., cotton),<br>
grains such as com, wheat, soybeans, sorghum, barley, oats, rye, and the like,<br>
herbs (e.g., peanuts), short rotation herbaceous crops such as switchgrass, alfalfa,<br>
and so forth.<br>
The term "plant biomass" or "ligno-cellulosic biomass" as used herein<br>
is intended to refer to virtually any plant-derived organic matter (woody or nonwoody)<br>
available for energy on a sustainable basis. Plant biomass can include,<br>
but is not limited to, agricultural crop wastes and residues such as com stover,<br>
wheat straw, rice straw, sugar cane bagasse and the like. Plant biomass further<br>
includes, but is not limited to, woody energy crops, wood wastes and residues<br>
such as trees, including fmit trees, such as fruit-bearing trees, (e.g., apple trees,<br>
orange trees, and the like), softwood forest thinnings, barky wastes, sawdust,<br>
paper and pulp industry waste streams, wood fiber, and the like. Additionally<br>
grass crops, such as various prairie grasses, including prairie cord grass,<br>
switchgrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, side oats grama, and the like, have<br>
6<br>
potential to be produced large-scale as additional plant biomass sources. For<br>
urban areas, potential plant biomass feedstock includes yard waste (e.g., grass<br>
clippings, leaves, tree clippings, brush, etc.) and vegetable processing waste.<br>
Plant biomass is known to be the most prevalent form of carbohydrate available<br>
in nature and com stover is currently the largest source of readily available plant<br>
biomass in the United States.<br>
The term "pretreatment step" as used herein, refers to any step<br>
intended to alter native biomass so it can be more efficiently and economically<br>
converted to reactive intermediate chemical compounds such as sugars, organic<br>
acids, etc., which can then be further processed to a variety of value added<br>
products such as ethanol. Pretreatment methods can utilize acids of varying<br>
concentrations (including sulfuric acids, hydrochloric acids, organic acids, etc.)<br>
and/or other components such as ammonia, ammonium, lime, and the like.<br>
Pretreatment methods can additionally or alternatively utilize hydrothermal<br>
treatments including water, heat, steam or pressurized steam. Pretreatment can<br>
occur or be deployed in various types of containers, reactors, pipes, flow through<br>
cells and the like. Many pretreatment methods will cause hydrolysis of<br>
hemicellulose to pentose sugars.<br>
The term "bulk density" as used herein, refers to the mass or dry weight<br>
of a quantity of particles or particulates (granules and other "divided" solids)<br>
divided by the total volume they occupy (mass/volume). Therefore, bulk density<br>
is not an intrinsic property of the particles, as it is changeable when the particles<br>
are subjected to movement from an external source. The volume measurement is<br>
a combination of the particle volume (which includes the internal pore volume of<br>
a particle) and the intra-particle void volume. Bulk density = intrinsic density (of<br>
each particle) x (1 - voids fraction). For a given intrinsic particle density,<br>
therefore, the bulk density depends only on the void fraction, which is variable.<br>
The term "moisture content" as used herein, refers to percent moisture<br>
of biomass. The moisture content is calculated as grams of water per gram of<br>
wet biomass (biomass dry matter plus water) times 100%.<br>
The term "Ammonia Fiber Explosion" or "Ammonia Fiber<br>
Expansion" (hereinafter "AFEX") pretreatment" as used herein, refers to a<br>
process for pretreating biomass with ammonia to solubilize lignin and redeposit<br>
it from in between plant cell walls to the surface of the biomass. An AFEX<br>
7<br>
pretreatment disrupts the lignocellulosic matrix, thus modifying the structure of<br>
lignin, partially hydrolyzing hemicellulose, and increasing the accessibility of<br>
cellulose and the remaining hemicellulose to subsequent enzymatic degradation.<br>
Lignin is a primary impediment to enzymatic hydrolysis of native biomass, and<br>
removal or transformation of lignin is a suspected mechanism of several of the<br>
leading pretreatment technologies, including AFEX. However in contrast to<br>
many other pretreatments, the lower temperatures and non-acidic conditions of<br>
the AFEX process reduces the conversion of lignin and sugars into lower<br>
molecular weight aromatics, furfural, hydroxymethyl furfural, and organic acids<br>
that could negatively affect microbial activity. The AFEX process further<br>
expands and swells cellulose fibers and further breaks up amorphous hemicellulose<br>
in lignocellulosic biomass. These structural changes open up the plant<br>
cell wall structure enabling more efficient and complete conversion of<br>
lignocellulosic biomass to value-added products while preserving the nutrient<br>
value and composition of the material.<br>
The term "condensed AFEX pretreatment" as used herein, refers to an<br>
AFEX pretreatment as defined herein, which uses gaseous ammonia rather than<br>
liquid ammonia. By allowing hot ammonia gas to condense directly on cooler<br>
biomass, the biomass heats up quickly and the ammonia and biomass come into<br>
intimate contact.<br>
The term "added binder" as used herein, refers to natural or synthetic<br>
substances or energy forms added or applied to loose biomass to improve<br>
stability and quality of a biomass particulate, comprised of a plurality of loose<br>
biomass fibers compressed to form a single particulate product, such as a pellet.<br>
Examples of common added binders include, but are not limited to, heat, steam,<br>
water, air, com starch, lignin compounds, lignite, coffee grounds, sap, pitch,<br>
polymers, salts, acids, bases, molasses, organic compounds, urea, and tar.<br>
Specialty additives are also used to improve binding and other pellet properties<br>
such as color, taste, pH stability, and water resistance. A binder may be added to<br>
the biomass at any time before, during or after a pelleting process. The amount<br>
of added binder may vary depending on the substrate being densified. Typically,<br>
the amount of added binder is about one to ten pounds per ton of loose biomass.<br>
Added binder in the form of added energy is typically in the form of convective<br>
or conducted heat in the range of 90 to 160 °C, although radiated heat may also<br>
8<br>
be used for the same purpose. The heat can be added outright or can be a result<br>
of the heat of friction developed in the pelleting equipment during operation.<br>
The term "particulate" as defined herein refers to solid biomass<br>
dividable into separate pieces, which can range from small microscopic particles<br>
(larger than powders) up to large objects, such as bricks, or larger, such as hay<br>
bales or larger, with any suitable mass. The specific geometry and mass will<br>
depend on a variety of factors including the type of biomass used, the amount of<br>
compression used to create the particulate, the desired length of the particulate,<br>
and the particular end use.<br>
The term "flowability" as used herein refers to the ability of particulates<br>
to flow out of a container using only the force of gravity. A product having<br>
increased flowability, therefore, would flow out of the container at a faster rate<br>
as compared to a product having lower flowability.<br>
Biomass Conversion to Alcohol<br>
Nearly all forms of ligno-cellulosic biomass, i.e., plant biomass, such as<br>
monocots, comprise three primary chemical fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose,<br>
and lignin. Hemicellulose is a polymer of short, highly-branched chains of<br>
mostly five-carbon pentose sugars (xylose and arabinose), and to a lesser extent<br>
six-carbon hexose sugars (galactose, glucose and mannose). Dicots, on the other<br>
hand, have a high content of pectate and/or pectin, which is a polymer of alphalinked<br>
glucuronic acid. Pectate may be "decorated" with mannose or rhamnose<br>
sugars, also). These sugars are highly substituted with acetic acid.<br>
Because of its branched structure, hemicellulose is amorphous and<br>
relatively easy to hydrolyze (breakdown or cleave) to its individual constituent<br>
sugars by enzyme or dilute acid treatment. Cellulose is a linear polymer of<br>
glucose sugars, much like starch, which is the primary substrate of com grain in<br>
dry grain and wet mill ethanol plants. However, unlike starch, the glucose<br>
sugars of cellulose are strung together by 6-glycosidic linkages which allow<br>
cellulose to form closely-associated linear chains. Because of the high degree of<br>
hydrogen bonding that can occur between cellulose chains, cellulose forms a<br>
rigid crystalline structure that is highly stable and much more resistant to<br>
hydrolysis by chemical or enzymatic attack than starch or hemicellulose<br>
polymers. Lignin, which is a polymer of phenolic molecules, provides structural<br>
9<br>
integrity to plants, and remains as residual material after the sugars in plant<br>
biomass have been fermented to ethanol. Lignin is a by-product of alcohol<br>
production and is considered a premium quality solid ftiel because of its zero<br>
sulfiir content and heating value, which is near that of sub-bituminous coal.<br>
Typical ranges of hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin concentrations in<br>
plants are shown in:<br>
http://www 1 .eere.energy.gov^iomass/feedstock_databases.html. Typically,<br>
cellulose makes up 30 to 50% of residues from agricultural, municipal, and<br>
forestry sources. While cellulose is more difficult to convert to ethanol than<br>
hemicellulose, it is the sugar polymers of hemicellulose which can be more<br>
readily hydrolyzed to their individual component sugars for subsequent<br>
fermentation to ethanol. Although hemicellulose sugars represent the "lowhanging"<br>
fruit for conversion to ethanol, the substantially higher content of<br>
cellulose represents the greater potential for maximizing alcohol yields, such as<br>
ethanol, on a per ton basis of plant biomass.<br>
As noted above, the hemicellulose fraction of biomass contains hexose<br>
and pentose sugars, while the cellulose fraction contains glucose. In current<br>
AFEX pretreatment operations, only limited hemicellulose conversions are<br>
obtained. It is further known that of the sugars extracted, about 30 to 35% is<br>
xylose and about 35 to 40% is glucose (most all of which is currently converted<br>
only in post-pretreatment steps). Overall conversions, as well as over-all ethanol<br>
yields, will vary depending on several factors such as biomass type, pretreatment<br>
type, and so forth.<br>
Conventional methods used to convert biomass to alcohol include<br>
processes employing a concentrated acid hydrolysis pretreatment, a two-stage<br>
acid hydrolysis pretreatment as well as processes employing any known<br>
conventional pretreatment, such as hydrothermal or chemical pretreatments,<br>
followed by an enzymatic hydrolysis (i.e., enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis) or<br>
simultaneous enzymatic hydrolysis and saccharification. Such pretreatment<br>
methods can include, but are not limited to, dilute acid hydrolysis, high pressure<br>
hot water-based methods, i.e., hydrothermal treatments such as steam explosion<br>
and aqueous hot water extraction, reactor systems (e.g., batch, continuous flow,<br>
counter-flow, flow-through, and the like), AFEX , ammonia recycled percolation<br>
(ARP), lime treatment and a pH-based treatment.<br>
10<br>
Several of these methods generate nearly complete hydrolysis of the<br>
hemicellulose fraction to efficiently recover high yields of the soluble pentose<br>
sugars. This also facilitates the physical removal of the surrounding<br>
hemicellulose and lignin, thus exposing the cellulose to later processing.<br>
However, most, if not all, pretreatment approaches do not significantly<br>
hydrolyze the cellulose fraction of biomass.<br>
Description of the Embodiments<br>
Pretreatment Methods<br>
In one embodiment, an ammonia fiber expansion (explosion) method<br>
(AFEX) pretreatment is used as defined herein. See also, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,106, 888 ('888), 7187,176 ('176), 5,037,663 ('663), and 4,600,590<br>
('590), each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In one embodiment, biomass is heated to a temperature of from about 60<br>
°C to about 100 °C in the presence of concentrated ammonia. See, for example.<br>
Dale, B.E. et al., 2004, Pretreatment of com stover using ammonia fiber<br>
expansion (AFEX). Applied Biochem, Biotechnol. 115: 951-963, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A rapid pressure drop then<br>
causes a physical disruption of the biomass structure, exposing cellulose and<br>
hemicellulose fibers, without the extreme sugar degradation common to many<br>
pretreatments.<br>
Nearly all of the ammonia can be recovered and reused while the<br>
remaining ammonia serves as nitrogen source for microbes in fermentation. In<br>
one embodiment, about one (1) to two (2) wt% of ammonia remains on the<br>
pretreated biomass.<br>
Additionally, since there is no wash stream in the process, dry matter<br>
recovery following an AFEX treatment is essentially quantitative. This is<br>
because AFEX is basically a dry to dry process.<br>
AFEX treated biomass is also stable for longer periods (e.g., up to at least<br>
a year) than non-AFEX treated biomass and can be fed at very high solids<br>
loadings (such as at least about 40%) in enzymatic hydrolysis or fermentation<br>
process as compared with dilute acid or other aqueous pretreatments that cannot<br>
easily exceed 20% solids.<br>
11<br>
Cellulose and hemicellulose are also well-preserved in an AFEX process,<br>
showing little degradation. As such, there is no need for neutralization prior to<br>
enzymatic hydrolysis of AFEX treated biomass. Enzymatic hydrolysis of AFEXtreated<br>
biomass also produces clean sugar streams for subsequent fermentation.<br>
Degradation products from AFEX treated biomass have also been<br>
identified and quantified. One such study compared AFEX and acid-pretreated<br>
com stover using LC-MS/GC-MS techniques. In acid-pretreated feedstock, over<br>
40 major compounds were detected, including organic acids, furans, aromatic<br>
compounds, phenolics, amides and oligosaccharides. AFEX pretreatment<br>
performed under mild alkaline condition produced very little acetic acid, HMF,<br>
and furfiiral. See, Dale, B.E. et al., 2004, supra, and Dale, B.E. et al, 2005b,<br>

In one embodiment, a modified AFEX pretreatment process is used as<br>
described in Example 1. In this method, gaseous ammonia is used, which<br>
condenses on the biomass itself<br>
In one embodiment, AFEX pretreatment conditions are optimized for a<br>
particular biomass type. Such conditions include, but are not limited to,<br>
ammonia loading, moisture content of biomass, temperature, and residence time.<br>
In one embodiment, com stover is subject to an AFEX pretreatment at a<br>
temperature of about 90 °C, ammonia: dry com stover mass ratio of 1:1,<br>
moisture content of com stover of 60% (dry weight basis, (dwb)), and residence<br>
time (holding at target temperature), of five (5) min. In one embodiment,<br>
switchgrass is subjected to an AFEX pretreatment at a temperature of about 100<br>
°C, ammonia loading of 1:1 kg of ammonia: kg of dry matter, and 80% moisture<br>
content (dwb) at five (5) min residence time.<br>
Hydrolysis resuUs of AFEX-treated and unfreated samples show 93% vs.<br>
16% glucan conversion, respectively. The ethanol yield of optimized AFEXtreated<br>
switchgrass was measured to be about 0.2 g ethanol/g dry biomass, which<br>
is 2.5 times more than that of the untreated sample. See Dale, B.E. et al., 2005b,<br>
supra.<br>
12<br>
In one embodiment, approximately 98% of the theoretical glucose yield<br>
is obtained during enzymatic hydrolysis of an AFEX treated com stover using 60<br>
filter paper units (FPU) of cellulase enzyme/g of glucan (equal to 22 FPU/g of<br>
dry com stover).<br>
Ethanol yield has been shown to increase by up to 2.2 times over that of<br>
an untreated sample. In one embodiment, lower enzyme loadings of 15 and 7.5<br>
FPU/g of glucan do not significantly affect the glucose yield, as compared with<br>
60 FPU. In this embodiment, differences between effects at different enzyme<br>
levels decreased as the treatment temperature increased. See, for example. Dale,<br>
B.E. et al., 2004, supra: and Dale, B.E. et al., 2004, supra.<br>
Optimal AFEX pretreatment conditions for hydrolysis and fermentation<br>
of switchgrass and com stover are also discussed in Dale, B.E. et al., 2004,<br>
supra; Dale, B.E. et al, 2005b, supra: and Dale, B.E. et al., 2005b, supra.<br>
In one embodiment, a modified AFEX treatment with significantly<br>
reduced ammonia loadings and lower required concentrations of ammonia is<br>
used. See Elizabeth (Newton) Sendich, et al.. Recent process improvements for<br>
the ammonia fiber expansion (AFEX) process and resulting reductions in<br>
minimum ethanol selling price, 2008, Bioresource Technology 99: 8429-8435<br>
and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2008/000873 to Dale, B.E.<br>
In one embodiment, steam is used as a pretreatment instead of or in<br>
addition to an AFEX treatment. However, steam tends to reduce availability of<br>
sugars, thus reducing the overall quality of animal feed. Regardless, steam<br>
remains a viable optional embodiment for pretreatment. When biomass is being<br>
pelletized, the pellets themselves typically become hot. Additionally, water is<br>
oftentimes added to bring the biomass up to a desired moisture content, such as<br>
between about 10 and 20%, such as about 12 and 18%, such as around 15% +<br>
1%. As such, steam typically develops prior to and during an AFEX<br>
pretreatment anyway. Addition of additional steam may allow water to be<br>
distributed evenly through the pellet. When the pelletization process is<br>
complete, steam will evaporate off and leave a pellet that is sufficient dry, i.e.,<br>
typically about five (5) to 20% moisture, although the invention is not so limited.<br>
Although a non-volatile base, such as sodium hydroxide, may also be<br>
used to move the lignin to the surface, the sodium hydroxide which remains after<br>
13<br>
evaporation may negatively impact further application of the treated material,<br>
such as for animal feed and other applications.<br>
Densification Process<br>
Due to temperatures reaching the glass transition temperature of the<br>
oligomers within the fiber (e.g., lignin, hemicelluloses), pretreatments, such as<br>
AFEX (and/or steam) also transfers these oligomers (primarily lignin), and in<br>
some embodiments, an amount of hemicellulose, to the surface. Once on the<br>
surface, the lignin and hemicellulose are tacky. Surprisingly, these oligomers<br>
(lignin or lignin and hemicellulose) contain sufficient tackiness to provide<br>
properties at least comparable to an added binder (as the term is defined herein).<br>
As such, the inventors have discovered there is no need to cure the pretreated<br>
biomass (e.g., with heat) prior to forming them into pellets. Additionally<br>
surprising and unexpected is the discovery that there is no need to add binder in<br>
any form to produce pellets having properties at least as good as, if not better<br>
than, conventional pellets containing binder. The ability to omit the step of<br>
adding curing and/or adding binding further provides significant costs savings<br>
during production, leading to a product which is not only environmentally green<br>
but highly economical and transportable, including transportation by<br>
conventional means.<br>
In one embodiment, the densification device utilizes a gear mesh system<br>
to compress biomass through a tapering channel between adjacent gear teeth.<br>
This densification device operates at temperatures less than 60 °C. (See Example<br>
2). In one embodiment energy consumption is minimized and physical and<br>
downstream processing characteristics are optimized.<br>
In one embodiment, an alternative pelleting device is used to form more<br>
conventional cylindrically-shaped pellets (See Example 4).<br>
Novel Intesrated Pretreatment and Densification Process<br>
In one embodiment, an integrated biomass pretreatment and densification<br>
process is provided. In a particular embodiment, an ammonia fiber expansion<br>
(AFEX) treatment is used in conjunction with a compaction process to produce<br>
densified biomass particulates (hereinafter called "pellets"), in a process<br>
requiring no added binder.<br>
14<br>
In one embodiment, the pellets have an inherent density of at least ten<br>
(10) times that of baled biomass (which itself is about 192.2 to about 240.28<br>
kg/m^ (about 12 to about 15 lb/ft')). Use of an integrated process as described<br>
herein eliminates the need for further pretreatment at the processing plant and<br>
further minimizes the distance that low density feedstock bales need to be<br>
transported.<br>
In one embodiment, densified pellets are transported to centralized<br>
processing facilities using existing transportation and handling infrastructure<br>
used for grains.<br>
In one embodiment, AFEX conditions are optimized according to the<br>
type of biomass being processed to enhance binding properties and increase<br>
hydrolysis efficiency following densification and storage.<br>
It is further expected that downstream processing characteristics will be<br>
at least as good or better than non-densified biomass in terms of hydrolysis,<br>
fermentation rates, yields, and so forth.<br>
Novel Properties of Densified Biomass<br>
In one embodiment, AFEX- biomass pellets having no added binder are<br>
provided. In contrast to conventional binder-containing pellets, the novel AFEX<br>
pellets described herein have a substantially smooth, non-flakey outer<br>
surface, likely due to the presence of lignin and, in some embodiments,<br>
hemicellulose, on the outer surface of the pellet, which essentially serve as a<br>
type of coating. As such, AFEX pellets are not susceptible to flaking (loss of<br>
mass) as with a conventional pellet which has no coating and contains removable<br>
flakes on its outer surface. In contrast to conventional pellets containing certain<br>
binders, such as water, which are dull in appearance, the novel AFEX biomass<br>
pellets have a shiny appearance. In some embodiments, the presence of lignin<br>
and/or hemicellulose is not restricted to the surface only, but also is found deeper<br>
inside the microscopic pores of the biomass particle. Therefore, the AFEX pellet<br>
may have added benefits, such as more efficient buming/co-firing with lignite<br>
coal than a conventional pellet whose added binder is chemically restricted to the<br>
surface of the biomass particle only.<br>
The AFEX pellets further are less bendable and therefore tend to be<br>
straighter than conventional pellets. Surprisingly, the novel AFEX pellets have a<br>
15<br>
harder "feel" to them (and are likely less brittle) as compared with the softer feel<br>
of a conventional pellet. Hardness tests (Example 4) reveal that the AFEX pellet<br>
is stronger initially before suddenly breaking. In contrast, a conventional pellet,<br>
such as a non-AFEX pellet, while maintaining strength for a longer time, is<br>
essentially more "squeezable" or "squishier" than the novel AFEX pellet (more<br>
comparable to softness of a "cigar"). In one embodiment, an AFEX-CS pellet is<br>
at least 21% harder and demonstrates at least 20% less variability in hardness.<br>
In one embodiment, the novel AFEX pellets exhibit less deformation than<br>
conventional pellets (See, for example. Table 7). It is likely that AFEX pellets<br>
made from other types of biomass will demonstrate similar or better results.<br>
Lignin is generally darker than other components in plant material, so the<br>
resulting material is noticeably darker in appearance than a material not<br>
substantially surrounded by lignin.<br>
In one embodiment, the AFEX-CS pellets have a specific gravity of up to<br>
1.16 as compared with a non-AFEX pellet with a specific gravity of no more<br>
than 0.87, although the invention is not so limited. As the AFEX pellets appear<br>
to be less porous and fiirther demonstrate superior hardness properties as<br>
compared with conventional pellets, AFEX pellets are likely to show improved<br>
short and long term storage properties including, flowability, compression<br>
strength, water solubility, absorption, and overall shelf life, with reduced<br>
susceptibility to degradation due to heat, bugs, and the like.<br>
It is also expected that the AFEX pellets will have an improved<br>
flowability. Further testing, as noted in prophetic examples will quantify the<br>
amount of improvement.<br>
Applications for APEX Pellets<br>
The resulting pellets are usefijl in a variety of applications, including, but<br>
not limited to, animal feed, chemical conversion, biochemical applications,<br>
electricity generating applications (e.g., burning in a boiler), fiiel for biomassbuming<br>
stoves, and as a component in solid materials, such as fiberboards and<br>
extruded fibrous building materials.<br>
The ammonia pretreatment in the various AFEX processes described<br>
herein dissolves a certain amount of lignin and fiirther brings a significant<br>
amount of lignin from the interior of a plant material to the outer surface or outer<br>
16<br>
edges of the fiber. As a result, the material is more easily digested by animals.<br>
In one embodiment, a combination of the novel AFEX pellets as described<br>
herein together with suitable additives and fillers as is known in the art produces<br>
a novel animal feed.<br>
A blending of the novel AFEX pellets here with coal provides a novel<br>
feed material in power plants.<br>
Biomass Distribution and Bioeconomic Considerations<br>
The logistics of harvesting, handling, transporting, and storing low bulk<br>
density feedstocks is a significant challenge to the developing bioeconomy.<br>
Assuming a yield of 70 gal/ton, biomass baled at a density 120 kg/m' would<br>
require over ten times the volume of material for a given volume of ethanol<br>
compared with com grain. This lower bulk density will not allow trucks to reach<br>
maximum weight capacity, further increasing the number of trucks required for<br>
feedstock supply. Biomass densification through an extrusion pelleting process<br>
has been demonstrated, but at a cost that limits the ability to lower net costs for<br>
feedstock delivery.<br>
As the bioeconomy develops individual producers will need the<br>
flexibility to sell their biomass into the bioenergy market as economics warrant.<br>
For example, with use of regional biomass processing centers (RBPCs) (within a<br>
5 to 10 mile area, for example), round bales may be transported using the<br>
existing infrastructure and equipment of the trucking industry. Because the<br>
RBPCs will be scaled appropriately, trucking distances for round bales will be<br>
minimized. Moreover, the presence of multiple, distributed RBPCs will<br>
minimize need for long term storage of round bales. Shorter term storage would<br>
use bale wraps and other current methods to minimize expense. With use of the<br>
novel integrated AFEX pretreatment/densification system described herein,<br>
densified pellets will then be more efficiently transported to centralized<br>
processing sites.<br>
The invention will be further described by reference to the following<br>
examples, which are offered to further illustrate various embodiments of the<br>
present invention. It should be understood, however, that many variations and<br>
modifications may be made while remaining within the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
Com stover (CS) (everything remaining after grain is harvested, typically<br>
including stalks and leaves w/o cobs)) from a hybrid com plant {Zea mays L.)<br>
grown at the Michigan State University (MSU) Agronomy Center Field was<br>
harvested in October 2007, and stored at room temperature in individual five (5)<br>
kg bags which were housed in a 30-gal trash bin. Switchgrass (SG) from the<br>
"Alamo" lowland variety of seed, Panicum virgatum L. grown at the Thelen<br>
Field located on Farm Lane at MSU, was harvested in October, 2005, and stored<br>
in sealed Ziploc® brand plastic bags in a freezer at four (4) °C.<br>
The CS and SG were each subjected to an AFEX treatment comparable<br>
to the methods described in U.S. Patent Nos. '888, '176, '663, and '590 noted<br>
above, but with certain modifications. Specifically, rather than applying<br>
condensed or liquid ammonia to the biomass and allowing the ammonia and<br>
biomass to react as in conventional AFEX treatment, gaseous ammonia was used<br>
instead. By allowing hot ammonia gas to condense directly on cooler biomass,<br>
the ammonia and biomass become well-mixed.<br>
The condensation AFEX process was performed in the Biomass<br>
Conversion Research Laboratory at Michigan State University, East Lansing,<br>
Michigan. Unless otherwise noted, standard laboratory equipment available in<br>
conventionally stocked laboratories was used. The AFEX procedure was<br>
performed in an approved ventilation hood with protective glass sash minimum<br>
face velocity of 75 feet/minute.<br>
A Parr Instruments Model 4524 bench top reactor (hereinafter "4254<br>
reactor") was used for this testing. The reaction chamber was first placed into<br>
the heating mantle of the 4254 reactor. A J-type T-couple temperature probe<br>
was connected to a Parr Instruments Model 4843 Modular (heat) controller<br>
(hereinafter "4843 controller") on one end and to the reaction chamber on the<br>
other end by placing the temperature probe against the internal wall of (about<br>
half-way down) the reaction chamber. The reaction chamber was then covered<br>
with a custom-fabricated circular stainless sheet metal piece having an<br>
approximately 12.7 cm (about five (5) in) diameter relief cut out for the<br>
temperature probe. The controller was tumed on to low (with a red heater<br>
18<br>
switch) and a J- type temperature (blue) controller showed a room temperature<br>
reading of about 25 °C ± 5°C.<br>
A (yellow) K-type thermocouple (red display) and (green) Omega brand<br>
CXI05 pressure connector (having offices in Stamford, CT) (green display)<br>
from the controller were briefly connected to test the 4254 reactor cover probes.<br>
The red display showed a room temperature reading of about 25 °C + 5°C. The<br>
green display showed a one (1) atm gauge pressure reading of -0.34 to about<br>
0.34 atm (about -5 to about 5 psig). The yellow and green connecters and 4254<br>
reactor cover were then set aside and the blue preheat temperature was turned on<br>
to preheat the 4254 reactor to a target temperature of room temperature +20 °C.<br>
The blue display was observed for about five (5) minutes to ensure that the blue<br>
temperature increased at a rate of about three (3) °C/minute.<br>
A Sartorius MA35 moisture analyzer (Goettingen, Germany) was used to<br>
determine the moisture content of each of the biomass samples. Initial moisture<br>
measurements for the samples were typically five (5) to ten (10) % total<br>
moisture wet basis (mwb). The dry weight equivalent of each sample added to<br>
the 4254 reactor was 150 g (dwb). An amount of biomass was then weighed out<br>
to resuh in 150 g of dry biomass (as given by the total moisture calculation). For<br>
example, for a biomass sample containing five (5) % total moisture (mwb), the<br>
following calculation would be made: x (g) of water in biomass = (0.05 * 150 g<br>
dry biomass). Solving for "x" results in 7.9 g of water present in the biomass.<br>
A calculation was then made to determine the amount of deionized water<br>
to be added to each sample. For com stover, the desired percentage of total<br>
water to dry biomass was 60%. For switchgrass, the desired value was 80%.<br>
These values were selected because they represent the optimal respective<br>
biomass moistures for maximum glucose and xylose yields from enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis after AFEX.<br>
Therefore, for a com stover sample with 7.9 g of water already present,<br>
but requiring 60% (dwb) moisture, the following calculation would be made: x<br>
(g) water to be added to biomass = (0.6 *150 g dry biomass) -7.9 g water already<br>
in biomass. Solving for "x" would result in 82.1 g of water to be added. The total<br>
weight of a 150 g (dwb) com stover sample in this instance would be 82.1 +g +<br>
7.9 g + 150 g = 240 g. Water was misted onto each biomass sample with a water<br>
19<br>
bottle until the total weight (dry biomass (g) + water desired (g)) was achieved.<br>
The biomass was evenly coated with water by stirring the biomass.<br>
An empty 500 ml ammonia cylinder having a 208 g maximum fill level<br>
(Parker 500 ml spun 316 Stainless steel pressure vessel (hereinafter "Parker<br>
cylinder") with high-pressure Swagelok® Series 83 two-way ball valves<br>
installed at both ends, made by Swagelok Co. (having offices in Chicago, IL)<br>
was weighed. Since eight (8) g was determined to be the approximate residual<br>
ammonia left in the cylinder after completion of this step, the total weight of the<br>
cylinder and ammonia required for AFEX treatment was determined by adding<br>
eight (8) g to the weight of the amount of ammonia needed.<br>
The Parker cylinder was attached to an Airgas^*^ brand stock ammonia<br>
tank (with siphon tube) made by Airgas, Inc. (Radnor, PA), by opening the inlet<br>
valve on the ammonia tank, followed by opening the inlet valve on the Parker<br>
cylinder. The Parker cylinder was allowed to fill until it was cold and no more<br>
filling noise from the cylinder could be heard (elapsed time was about one (1)<br>
min). The exit valve on the ammonia tank was opened about 1/4 way. After a<br>
few trials, it was determined that it took about 20 seconds to add 158 g of<br>
ammonia to the Parker cylinder. Thereafter, all valves were closed, starting with<br>
the exit valve of the Parker cylinder and finally the exit valve on the ammonia<br>
tank. The Parker cylinder was weighed to make sure the total weight was equal<br>
to the expected weight. Some ammonia was released under the hood if the<br>
weight was too great. When it was not enough, the above step was repeated.<br>
The Parker cylinder, now containing ammonia, was heated by first<br>
wrapping it in BH Thermal brand Briskheat (Columbus, OH) heat tape and<br>
plugging in the BH Thermal brand Briskheat (Columbus, OH) heat tape<br>
controller. Cylinder pressure started at 0-125 psig (depending on the<br>
temperature of the ammonia inside the cylinder, as it became cold during the<br>
filling step). The Parker cylinder was heated to 600 psig (40 bar), adjustable<br>
from 400 psig (27 bar) for "colder" reactions (80 °C) to 1000 psig (70 bar) for<br>
hot reactions (160 °C). The pressure increased slowly, but always at a rate less<br>
than 0.034 atm/sec (five (5) psig/sec).<br>
The desired biomass was then added to the reaction chamber. The (black)<br>
temperature probe was removed from the reaction chamber and placed into the<br>
slot on the side of the heater mantle that allowed the outside surface temperature<br>
20<br>
of the reaction chamber to be measured. The (blue) display temperature was<br>
adjusted (using arrow keys) +20 degrees more than the original preheat to allow<br>
for the continued heating of the reaction chamber.<br>
The cover of the reaction chamber was replaced and a funnel was added.<br>
The selected biomass sample was then poured down the funnel into the reaction<br>
chamber. Once added, the (yellow) temperature probe tip was completely<br>
covered with biomass and was observed to be about 2.54 cm (about one (1) in)<br>
from the ammonia input nozzle of the cover. The funnel was then removed, the<br>
cover returned on top of the 4254 reactor and brackets were tightened with bolts<br>
to seal it in place.<br>
The Parker cylinder was then attached to the reaction chamber. A Welch<br>
Model 8803 vacuum pump. (Niles, Illinois) was also attached to the reaction<br>
chamber. The vacuum valve on the 4524 reactor was opened and the vacuum<br>
was turned on to pump air from the 4254 reactor for one (1) minute. The<br>
vacuum valve was closed and the vacuum was turn off. The (yellow)<br>
temperature probe and (green) pressure connector was plugged into the 4843<br>
controller. The valve on ammonia cylinder (only) leading towards reaction<br>
chamber was opened.<br>
The AFEX reaction was started by opening the 4254 reactor valve<br>
connected to the Parker cylinder. When the pressure between the Parker<br>
ammonia cylinder and the reaction chamber was equalized, the valves between<br>
the ammonia cylinder and the reaction chamber were closed (i.e., after about one<br>
(1) min). The heat tape on the Parker cylinder was also turned off. The 4843<br>
reactor heater was left on a low setting at 20 °C above the original temperature<br>
used at pre-heat. After about one (1) minute the peak (red) display temperature<br>
and (green) pressure were recorded. When the (red) display temperature did not<br>
get &gt;100C within 1 minute, it meant the feedstock is not touching the<br>
temperature probe. The temperature and pressure were recorded approximately<br>
every five (5) minutes thereafter.<br>
Starting approximately five (5) minutes before expansion step noted<br>
below, the vacuum was detached from the 4524 reaction chamber cover. The<br>
ammonia cylinder pipe was removed from the reaction chamber cover. The<br>
reaction chamber was rotated so that the 4524 pressure release valve was facing<br>
toward the back of the fiime ventilation hood. The ventilation hood sash was<br>
21<br>
adjusted for maximum face velocity (75 feet/minute recommended). Expansion<br>
step: Ear protection was worn. The ammonia pressure in the 4524 was released<br>
by opening the pressure release valve quickly.<br>
The reaction chamber cover was removed. The biomass was removed<br>
and placed in a tray and left under the ventilation hood to allow ammonia vapor<br>
to volatilize. The APEX biomass was allowed to air-dry over-night. The Parker<br>
cylinder was weighed to determine residual grams of ammonia applied to the<br>
biomass and the weight was recorded. The remaining ammonia (approximately<br>
8 g) was released from the Parker cylinder inside of ventilation hood.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Starting Materials and Sample Preparation<br>
Com stover (CS) obtained from the same source as in Example 1 was<br>
used. Two samples, two (2) kg each, of each type of biomass were then<br>
subjected to the APEX pretreatment according to the method described in<br>
Example 1. After pretreatment, samples were densified using a pelleting device<br>
(Federal Machine Co. d/b/a ComPAKco, LLC, Fargo, ND) to produce APEX<br>
com stover (APEX-CS) pellets and APEX switchgrass (APEX-SG) pellets.<br>
PIG. 1 shows an image of the four resulting products, which include<br>
seven (7) g of APEX-CS 102, 12 g of APEX-SG 104, a 22 g APEX-CS 106<br>
pellet and a 23 g APEX-SG pellet 108). The APEX-CS and APEX SG pellets,<br>
106 and 108, respectively, had a substantially rectangular shape. Both pellets<br>
106 and 108 were about 2.54 cm (about one (1) in) wide, about 1.27 (0.5 in)<br>
depth and about 10.16 to about 12.7 cm (about four (4) to about five (5) in) in<br>
length. (Pellet length is dependent on the particular setting use on the<br>
ComPAKco machine).<br>
This image illustrates that just seven (7) to 12 grams of unpelleted<br>
biomass, such as APEX-CS 102 and APEX-SG 104, occupies more space than a<br>
22 or 23 g pellet, such as APEX-CS pellet 106 and APEX-SG pellet 108. In this<br>
instance, the unpelleted biomass (102 and 104) occupies about 570 to about<br>
980% more space than the pelleted biomass (106 and 108).<br>

Testing Performed<br>
Several additional samples were prepared in the manner described above<br>
and subjected to preliminary physical tests such as Angle of Repose (°)<br>
according to the method described in Carr, R. L. Jr. 1965. Evaluating flow<br>
properties of solids. Chemical Engineering 72(3): 163-168.<br>
Thermal Conductivity (W/m°C) was determined with a thermal<br>
properties meter (KD2, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) that utilized the line<br>
heat source probe technique described in Baghe-Khandan, M., S. Y Choi, and<br>

Water activity was measured using a calibrated water activity meter (AW<br>
Sprint TH 500, Novasina, Talstrasse, Switzerland).<br>
Bulk density (kg/m^), true density (kg/m^) and porosity were determined<br>
using a multivolume pycnometer (Micromeritics model 1305, Norcross, GA) as<br>
described in Sahin, S. and S. G. Sumnu. 2006, Physical properties of foods. New<br>
York, NY: Springer Science Media, LLC.<br>
Moisture Content (% db) was determined by ASAE standard method<br>
S352.1 using ISOTEMP laboratory scale (model no: 838F, Fisher Scientific,<br>
Pittsburg, PA) as described in ASAE Standards. 51'* ed. 2004. S352.1: Moisture<br>
measurement — Grain and seeds. St. Joseph, Mich.: ASABE.<br>
Color properties (L*, a*, b*) were measured using a spectrocolorimeter<br>
(LabScan XE, Hunter Associates Laboratory, Reston, VA).<br>
Roundness and sphericity were determined using an Olympus SZHIO<br>
stereo microscope with a DP digital camera, followed by image analysis of the<br>
particles by Image Pro Plus® software.<br>
Water Solubility Index (%) and Water Absorption Index (-) were<br>
calculated using the method described in Anderson, R. A., H. F. Conway, V. F.<br>

Conclusions<br>
The AFEX-CS pellets (e.g., 106) and AFEX-SG pellets (e.g., 108), had a<br>
relatively smooth surface and held together well during handling. The AFEX<br>
pellets of both the com stover and switchgrass possess lower porosity, water<br>
adsorption index, water activity, and moisture content as compared to the nonpelleted<br>
AFEX samples. Such properties are an indication of improved<br>
storability for the pelleted biomass. Lower porosity, higher bulk density and<br>
higher true density of the pellets are also indicative of reduced shipping costs.<br>
The pellets exhibited other desirable properties as shown in Table 1. In<br>
particular, the pellets demonstrated a high angle of repose. A pellet's angle of<br>
repose is defined as the angle between the horizontal and the plane of contact<br>
between two pellets when the upper pellet is just about to slide over the lower.<br>
This is also known as angle of friction. Therefore, particles have an expected<br>
value of 45 degrees. Both the com stover pellets and switchgrass pellets tested<br>
herein exhibited higher than expected angles of repose of 57.4 and 60.6,<br>
respectively, as shown in Table 1. These values are likely related to the pellets'<br>
substantially rectangular geometry.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The purpose of this experiment was to compare hydrolysis properties of<br>
AFEX-CS pellets as compared with AFEX-CS biomass (i.e., unpelleted).<br>
Starting Materials<br>
Com stover (CS) obtained from the same source as in Example 1 was<br>
used. An AFEX pretreatment was performed on the CS in the same manner as<br>
described in Example 1. Pellets were made according to the method described in<br>
Example 2.<br>
Tested samples included 1.7 g of AFEX-CS biomass, a 1.6 g AFEX-CS<br>
pellet, and a 2.2 g AFEX-CS soaked in 100 ml amount of de-ionized water at 25<br>
°C for five (5) minutes before hydrolysis to produce a soaked AFEX-CS pellet.<br>
25<br>
Procedure<br>
After being placed in a 500 ml beaker, an enzymatic hydrolysis was<br>
performed on each sample according to a standard laboratory protocol at one<br>
(1)% solids loading. See, for example, Shishir P.S. Chundawat , Balan<br>
Venkatesh, Bruce E. Dale, 2005, Effect of particle size based separation of<br>
milled com stover on AFEX pretreatment and enzymatic digestibility,<br>
Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. 96, Issue 2, pp 219-231.<br>
Fifteen Filter Paper Units (FPU) of an enzyme, specifically Spezyme® CP<br>
(Genencor®, a Danisco Division, having offices in Rochester, NY whole<br>
cellulose, was added. The samples were incubated at 50 °C in a New Brunswick<br>
incubator Innova 44, (Edison, NJ) while being shaken at 150 RPM within the<br>
incubator. Observations and samples were taken at 6 hrs, 24 hrs and 72 hrs<br>
incubation time.<br>
Results<br>
A visual inspection of the resulting hydrolysates indicates that each of<br>
the three samples completely dissolved immediately upon water addition. (FIG.<br>
3B). Therefore, it is apparent that all three samples hydrolyzed to substantially<br>
the same extent in substantially the same amount of time.<br>
Approximately two (2) ml samples were taken from the incubator were<br>
filtered and run through a Shimadzu high pressure liquid chromatographer<br>
(HPLC) Model LC-2010HT w/ELSD-LT to determine glucan and xylan<br>
conversions.<br>
FIGS. 4A and 4B are comparative hydrolysis graphs showing glucan<br>
conversions of the samples shown in FIGS. 3A-3E. As can be seen, the glucan<br>
conversions remain substantially the same across each sample.<br>

each of the samples.<br>

Conclusion<br>
The substantially instantaneous hydrolyzing (e.g., wetting and<br>
dispersion) in the AFEX- CS pellet demonstrates that pelleting of com stover<br>
biomass does not affect hydrolysis. It is likely that other AFEX pellets made<br>
from other biomass materials will behave in a similar manner. Indeed, as FIG.<br>
3B shows, most of the biomass in each pellet is converted to sugar within six<br>
(hrs), which compares favorably with the unpelleted AFEX-CS biomass sample.<br>
Additionally, both pellets (AFEX-CS pellet and the soaked AFEX-CS pellet)<br>
hydrolyzed to nearly the same extent as the unpelleted sample. This<br>
determination was made by observing the lack of solids remaining after 72 hours<br>
(FIG. 3E). Since the three samples had virtually the same conversions, the test<br>
was concluded at 72 hours. These results are confirmed in FIGS. 4A and 4B.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
This test was performed to determine the comparative hardness between<br>
AFEX-CS pellets and non AFEX-CS pellets.<br>
Starting Materials<br>
CS obtained from the same source as in Example 1 was used in this<br>
testing. Some of the CS was subjected to the AFEX pretreatment as described in<br>
Example 1. No additional treatment was performed on the AFEX-treated<br>
biomass prior to pelleting, including no added binder and no artificial drying<br>
(any evaporation occurring in open air at room temperature is considered to be<br>
negligible during the course of the testing procedure).<br>
The remaining portion underwent a different (non-AFEX) procedure,<br>
which included adding approximately five (5) to ten (10) g of water per 100 g of<br>
CS to bring the moisture content of the biomass to 15% wet basis (wb) prior to<br>
pelleting.<br>
Lodgepole pine biomass from the Driftmier Engineering Laboratory at<br>
the University of Georgia (Athens, GA).also underwent a similar non-AFEX<br>
29<br>
procedure, and because the biomass moisture was measured to be greater than<br>
15%, it was put in a dryer until it was at 12-15% moisture.<br>
Ten (10) AFEX-CS pellets and ten (10) non-AFEX-CS pellets were<br>
formed with a Yankee Pellet Machine Model 400 (Yankee Pellet Mill,<br>
Effingham, NH), a centrifugal die mill which produces pellets currently<br>
considered the industry standard. Ten (10) non-AFEX pine pellets were<br>
pelletized using a California Pellet Machine, Model CL (CPM, Crawfordsville,<br>
IN).<br>
Pellets produced on both these machines have a substantially cylindrical<br>
shape and are about six (6) mm in diameter. Length can be varied as desired, but<br>
is generally more uniform than the device used above in Example 2. For<br>
purposes of testing, the pellets were about one (1) inch.<br>
Procedure<br>
The pellets were tested for hardness using a 12T Carver Laboratory<br>
Hydraulic Press/Hardness testing apparatus with 400PSI gauge (Carver, Wabash,<br>
IN). Specifically, this test measured the amount of force needed to crush each<br>
pellet beyond its yield strength. The determination of "yield strength" was made<br>
through trained observation and "feel." Specifically, pressure was applied to<br>
each pellet until the tester observed and felt the pellet "give." Multiple pellets<br>
were tested and an average hardness, i.e., pressure required to cause pellets to<br>
yield (Table 6), and average deformation (Table 7) were determined.<br>
Results<br>
Comparative hardness results are shown below in Table 6:<br>

The untreated, binder-added com stover pellets average yield point was<br>
98 psi +25 psi. The AFEX, no binder added com stover pellets average yield<br>
point was 119 psi +20 psi, and the non-AFEX binder-added pine pellet average<br>
yield point was 98 psi +23 psi.<br>
31<br>
All cylindrical pellets had a beginning diameter of 6.00 mm. The<br>
untreated, binder-added com stover pellets average deformation at yield was<br>
1.06 mm +0.36 mm. The AFEX, no binder added com stover pellets average<br>
deformation at yield was 0.95 mm +0.24 mm, and the non-AFEX, binder-added<br>
pine pellet average deformation at yield was 1.06 mm +0.23 mm.<br>
Conclusion<br>
The AFEX pellets showed greater durability as compared to non-AFEX<br>
pellets. AFEX pellet quality is also more consistent than the non-AFEX pellets.<br>
As such, it is expected that any given AFEX pellet is less likely to be deformed<br>
or disfigured (not a cylindrical shape) as compared with a non-AFEX pellet.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
This test was performed to determine the bulk density of AFEX-CS<br>
pellets as compared to non-AFEX CS pellets.<br>
AFEX-CS pellets and non-AFEX CS produced according to the method<br>
described in Example 4 (about six (6) mm in diameter and about one (1) inch in<br>
length) were added to a 500 ml beaker and weighed.<br>
The non-AFEX CS pellets had a bulk density of about 36 Ib/ft^ (553 g/L),<br>
while the AFEX-CS pellets had a bulk density of about bout 38 Ib/tf (578g/L).<br>
As this preliminary test indicates, the AFEX-CS pellets showed a higher<br>
bulk density than the non-AFEX CS pellets. This is likely due to their smooth<br>
non-flaky outer surface (which also is expected to improve their flowability), as<br>
compared to the rough flaky outer surface of the non-AFEX pellets. It is<br>
expected that a test performed on a larger scale would demonstrate an even<br>
greater difference in bulk density. Likely, the edge effects caused by the small<br>
size of the container were a significant factor in this preliminary testing.<br>
It is also possible that pellets which are longer than the one (1) inch<br>
pellets may weigh each other down to create a higher mass at a higher density.<br>
Altematively, shorter pellets may pack better. Additional testing (including in<br>
larger containers) will be performed to optimize pellet size, and therefore,<br>
overall bulk density, for a given application.<br>
32<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
In this testing, various properties untreated com stover pellets was<br>
compared with AFEX-treated com stover pellets.<br>
Starting Materials<br>
Com stover (CS) obtained from the same source as in Example 1 was<br>
used. An AFEX pretreatment was performed on the CS in the same manner as<br>
described in Example 1. Pellets were made according to the method described in<br>
Example 2.<br>

Conclusion<br>
As the results in Tables 8 and 9 show, the AFEX pellet has an increased<br>
gross caloric value, i.e., an AFEX pellet bums about 4.8% more efficiently due<br>
to the presence of less moisture in the AFEX pellet as compared with an<br>
untreated pellet. Specifically, the caloric increase, non-AFEX to AFEX was<br>
calculated as follows: 7388 Btu/lb - 7048 Btu/lb = 340 Btu/lb (or 748 Btu/kg);<br>
therefore % increase, non AFEX to AFEX is (340 Btu/lb)/(7048 Btu/lb) * 100%<br>
= 4.8%. Additionally, bulk density increased by an average of seven (7)% and<br>
there is an approximately 65% reduction in the amount of fines (i.e., broken<br>
pieces having a diameter less than 0.125 cm) in an AFEX pellet beg weighing<br>
about 3.5 lb (1.6 kg) as compared with a pellet bag of untreated com stover<br>
having approximately the same weight.<br>
Additionally, although the "durability indices" between AFEX and non-<br>
AFEX pellets are substantially the same in this testing, the method of testing<br>
durability was a simple tumbling experiment ("Kansas State Method"), as<br>
compared with the destructive testing described in the above examples. As such,<br>
35<br>
insufficient energy is provided to create the separation required to be able to<br>
properly distinguish between the pellets. Regardless, a high durability indice<br>
shows that the AFEX pellets are suitable for use in the pellet industry.<br>
EXAMPLE 7 (PROPHETIC)<br>
Samples of biomass, such as switchgrass and prairie cord grass will be<br>
collected at various maturities, and com stover will be collected following grain<br>
harvest. Biomass composition will be determined at harvest, during storage in<br>
round bales, after initial AFEX processing and densification, and after storage of<br>
densified pellets. AFEX pretreatment will be statistically optimized for<br>
hydrolysis and binding properties based on parameters of time, temperature,<br>
biomass moisture, and ammonia to biomass ratio. AFEX conditions providing at<br>
least 90% of glucan conversion and 80% xylan conversion will be used to<br>
prepare materials for densification.<br>
Densification will be performed using any suitable method, including the<br>
methods used in Examples 2 and 3.<br>
The resulting pellets will be subjected to various environmental<br>
conditions to simulate long-term storage, and then evaluated for flowability,<br>
compression strength, water solubility, water absorption, etc. Downstream<br>
processing characteristics will be evaluated using a standardized set of<br>
hydrolysis and fermentation conditions, including separate hydrolysis and<br>
fermentation (SHF) vs. simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF). In<br>
one embodiment a comparison of these properties will be made between freshly<br>
prepared pellets (i.e., within about one (1) month), stored pellets and nondensified<br>
biomass.<br>
EXAMPLE 8 (PROPHETIC)<br>
AFEX pretreatment of prairie cord grass will be statistically optimized<br>
for time, temperature, biomass moisture, and ammonia to biomass ratio. A fairly<br>
broad range of AFEX conditions gives similar hydrolysis results, giving us<br>
confidence that there are sets of pretreatment conditions that also enhance<br>
binding properties. AFEX conditions providing at least 90% of glucan<br>
36<br>
conversion and 80% xylan conversion will be identified and used to prepare<br>
materials for densification. We will characterize these pretreated materials for<br>
surface properties using various methods developed in our lab (ESCA, Prussian<br>
blue staining, SEM), and will correlate those properties with the pellet density<br>
and durability.<br>
EXAMPLE 9 (PROPHETIC)<br>
Ten (10) kilograms each of com stover and switchgrass will be subjected<br>
to AFEX pretreatment. These materials will preferably be chopped and milled<br>
into 5 different particle sizes, ranging from 850 microns to 2.5 cm prior to<br>
receipt by the supplier.<br>
A ten (10) kg sample of this species will be used to do a statisticallyoptimized<br>
AFEX study. The optimal AFEX treatment conditions identified<br>
providing at least 90% of glucan conversion to glucose and 80% xylan<br>
conversion to xylose will be identified. These conditions will be used to prepare<br>
a 10 kg batch of AFEX prairie cord grass, at the varied particle sizes.<br>
It is estimated that each kilogram of AFEX biomass should produce<br>
approximately forty (40) of the approximately 2.54 x 1.59 x 10.16 cm (about one<br>
(1) X 0.625 X four (4) in) "single-stroke" pellets. Therefore, for each biomass<br>
species, 80 AFEX-treated pellets of each of the five biomass particle size should<br>
be obtained, for a total of 400 pellets per feedstock to be tested for durability and<br>
suitability. These AFEX pretreated materials will also be evaluated for their<br>
surface properties using various methods (e.g., ESCA, Prussian blue staining,<br>
SEM), and correlate those properties with the pellet density.<br>
EXAMPLE 10 (PROPHETIC)<br>
Operating variables will be investigated to optimize operating conditions<br>
for converting pretreated biomass into densified pellets. These variables<br>
includes AFEX conditions, moisture content, particle size, die temperature<br>
versus bond strength, rate of compaction versus quality of output, energy usage,<br>
existing surface chemistry and variations, compaction ratios and resultant<br>
37<br>
density, and compacted package size and shape. Attrition and wear of<br>
mechanical components will also be assessed.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 (PROPHETIC)<br>
Biomass pretreated using any known AFEX procedure or according to<br>
the procedure in Example 1 or with any other appropriate modification of an<br>
AFEX procedure will be densified using any suitable method, including the<br>
methods described in Examples 2 and 3.<br>
The densified biomass will then be subjected to various environmental<br>
conditions, including temperature (25 to 40°C), relative humidity (60 to 90%),<br>
consolidation stress (0 to 120 kPa), and storage time (0 to 6 mo). Following<br>
storage, physical characteristics will be evaluated as described below:<br>
Flowability may be evaluated with a simple test in which a number of<br>
AFEX-pellets are placed in a container, such as the bed of a truck and tipped to<br>
about 45 degrees. A comparison with conventional pellets may be made by<br>
noting the time it takes for the pellets to flow out of the container.<br>
Flowability will also be evaluated using Carr Indices. See ASTM<br>
D6393. 1999, Standard test method for bulk solids characterization by Canindices,<br>
ASTM Standards, W. Conshohocken. PA. Flowability is<br>
comprehensively defined as the ability of a material to flow un-abruptly under a<br>
given environmental condition. The flowability measurement is most often done<br>
by Carr Indices, by calculating the total flowability index and total floodability<br>
index. Carr, R. L. Jr. 1965, Evaluating flow properties of solids. Chemical<br>
Engineering Hi}): 163-168.<br>
A higher value to total flowability index and lower value to total<br>
floodability index will yield an ideal material with low or no flow problems.<br>
Another way to quantify flowability is by measuring the Jenike Shear Stress<br>
properties. See Jenike, A. W. 1964, Storage and flow of Bulletin No. 123, Utah<br>
Engineering station, Bulletin of University of Utah. Jenike's method will also be<br>
used to determine particle cohesion, yield locus, angle of internal friction, yield<br>
strength, and flow fianction, and particle size distribution. See ASTM D6128.<br>

Additionally, glucan, xylan, galactan, arabinan, mannan, lignin, ash and<br>
fiber levels will be evaluated to determine their effect on storage and flowability<br>
behavior. Furthermore, several other physical properties will be measured as<br>
indicators of poor flowability (i.e., particle size, particle shape, thermal<br>
properties, moisture properties, and color). See Selig, M, et al., 2008, Enzymatic<br>

Rheological material properties that affect the ability of biomass to be<br>
handled pre- and post-densification will be established. Such properties include,<br>
but are not limited to, bulk density, true density, compressibility, relaxation,<br>
springback, permeability, unconfined yield strength, and frictional qualities.<br>
These properties are a function of the feedstock particle size and distribution,<br>
shape factor, moisture condition, and consolidation pressure and time. Since<br>
commercial rheological testers are typically designed for use with small grains<br>
and fine powders; and consequently, do not accommodate particulate that is<br>
greater than V* inch in diameter, we will develop new measurement systems for<br>
characterizing larger feedstock particles. Systems include compaction and shear<br>
cells that can be scaled for various material sizes, integrated with commercial<br>
load frames, and operated over a range of consolidation pressures.<br>
Data will be analyzed to determine conditions which lead to improved<br>
(or optimized) flowability, using formal statistical methods such as general<br>
linear models, regression, response surface analysis, multivariate analysis, and<br>
other techniques as appropriate. See Myers, H. R. 1986, Classical and modem<br>
regression applications. 2"** edition. Duxbury publications, CA. USA. Draper, N.<br>

EXAMPLE 12 (PROPHETIC)<br>
The impact on downstream processing, such as feedstock pretreatment,<br>
densification, and storage on bioconversion efficiency from the integrated<br>
AFEX/densification process will be evaluated. Tests will be carried out using a<br>
standardized set of conditions for both enzymatic hydrolysis and microbial<br>
fermentation.<br>
At least three types of biomass will be evaluated, namely com stover,<br>
switchgrass, and prairie cord grass. For each of these feedstocks, samples of raw<br>
ground biomass, AFEX-treated biomass, and AFEX-treated and densified<br>
biomass (before and after storage) will be collected. Thus, 3 x 4 = 12 total<br>
biomass sample types will be evaluated. Conversion trials will be conducted in<br>
500 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 48 dry g biomass and 152 ml of 2 M<br>
phosphate buffer (pH 4.3). The 24% solids loading rate was selected to simulate<br>
industrial conditions. Preliminary trials have shown that AFEX/densified pellets<br>
solubilize rapidly upon immersion in water, therefore grinding will not be<br>
necessary (See Example 2). At this point the pH should be 4.7-4.9, and will be<br>
adjusted to that level if necessary. To prevent bacterial contamination, 12 ml of a<br>
10 mg/ml tetracycline stock solution will be added.<br>
Beyond comparing the three types of feedstocks and four pretreatment<br>
combinations, conversion methods, enzyme sources, and enzyme dosage will<br>
also be compared as outlined below. Therefore, the nominal enzyme dosage of<br>
15 FPU Spezyme® CP and 64 /JNPGU Novozyme®188 per g glucan will be<br>
compared, with a more challenging dosage of one third those rates. A similar<br>
pair of enzyme dosages will be calculated for the extremophile enzyme source.<br>
Separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) will be evaluated. For<br>
saccharification, flasks will be incubated for 48 h at 50 °C and 250 rpm in an<br>
orbital shaker. Samples will be removed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 hr.<br>
Flasks will then be cooled to 30 °C and inoculated with 2 ml of a 12-18 h culture<br>
of a recombinant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae which possesses pentose-<br>
40<br>
fermenting capabilities grown in a medium containing two (2) g/1 glucose and<br>
two (2) g/1 yeast extract. Flasks will be incubated for an additional 96 h at 30 °C<br>
and 150 rpm in an orbital shaker. Samples will be removed at 0, 3, 6, 9, 18, 24,<br>
36, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96 hr during fermentation.<br>
Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) will also be<br>
performed to evaluate conversion. The main difference will be that flasks will be<br>
dosed with enzyme and immediately inoculated with yeast as noted above, then<br>
incubated for 144 hr at 30°C. Samples will be removed at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 18, 24,<br>
36, 48, 60, 72, 96, 120, and 144 hr. Enzyme and biomass loadings and other<br>
conditions will be identical to those listed above.<br>
Additionally, both SHE and SSE, replicating the conditions listed above,<br>
except for the enzyme source. Crude enzyme preparations from lignocellulose<br>
degrading extremophiles isolated from the Homestake Mine in Lead, SD, now<br>
known as the Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory (DUSEL),<br>
will be used. See Bang, S., et al, 2008. Biofuels group NSF DUSEL project<br>
[abstract]. Homestake DUSEL Spring Workshop. Talk 10. p. 2. These enzymes<br>
will be added in appropriate amounts to achieve comparable enzyme dosages to<br>
those above.<br>
Samples will be analyzed for carbohydrates, organic acids, and ethanol<br>
via HPLC using a Biorad® HPX 87H column and refractive index detector. As<br>
noted previously, the APEX process does not produce inhibitors such as furfural<br>
and hydroxymethyl furfural, and thus it will not be necessary to measure these.<br>
During fermentation, yeast and/or bacterial populations will be measured by<br>
hemocytometer or plate counts using potato dextrose agar. Three replications of<br>
each saccharification/fermentation will be performed for each treatment.<br>
Parameters to be calculated will include rates and yields for both saccharification<br>
and fermentation. Results will be averaged and statistically analyzed.<br>
EXAMPLE 13 (PROPHETIC)<br>
Techno-economic models will be developed for the AFEX and<br>
densification processes of the pretreatment and densification facility. These<br>
models will be constructed using material and energy balance data collected<br>
41<br>
upon completion of the aforementioned objectives and the general principles of<br>
engineering design. Both capital and operating costs will be estimated by the<br>
techno-economic model for each process. The feedstock cost will be assigned a<br>
value reflective of an informed estimate of its delivered cost. Once the costs are<br>
modeled, optimization methods, such as linear programming, will be used to<br>
minimize overall costs and determine an optimum capacity for the pretreatment<br>
and densification center facilities. The minimum feasible scale will be<br>
determined to assess the efficacy of the process for distributed adoption.<br>
A preliminary model of the AFEX process will be constructed to<br>
interface with the subsequent densification process. Specifically, AFEX will be<br>
modeled as either a batch or a continuous process, depending upon the origin of<br>
the collected data. The capital and operating costs associated with feeding the<br>
AFEX reactor will be included in the model. AFEX reactors will be sized to<br>
achieve the desired capacity of pretreated biomass. Heat will be generated in the<br>
reactor as ammonia dissolves in the water present in the biomass. Additional<br>
heat will be provided by saturated steam at moderate to high pressures, either by<br>
direct injection or by indirect contact. Ammonia will be recovered by steam<br>
stripping the pretreated biomass using distillation. The bottom stage of the<br>
column will produce pretreated biomass that is relatively low in ammonia<br>
concentration.<br>
The pretreated biomass may be dried in a rotary dryer prior to<br>
compaction in the densification process. Both the ammonia-rich distillate and<br>
the volatilized gas from the rotary dryer will be combined and re-pressurized for<br>
recycle to the AFEX reactor. The amount of ammonia recycle is expected to<br>
comprise in excess of 95% of the ammonia needed for pretreatment. The costs<br>
of biomass, fresh ammonia feed, steam, and electricity will reflect industry<br>
values at the time the techno-economic model is constructed. Capital costs will<br>
be based upon the cost of fabrication using materials of construction that are<br>
compatible with the ammonia-biomass mixtures. All cost inputs will be<br>
adjustable to enable a subsequent sensitivity analysis. This analysis will<br>
determine the variables which are likely to result in marked increases in the cost<br>
of pretreated biomass.<br>
42<br>
Subsequently the external costs for the pretreatment and densification<br>
(P&amp;D) facility, including transportation, storage, and material handling will be<br>
determined. The overall cost-to-benefit ratios for the proposed P&amp;D systems will<br>
then be compared to a centralized pretreatment and processing alternative<br>
without densification in order to quantify system advantages. It is anticipated<br>
that some components, such as transportation costs and material loss, may favor<br>
the proposed distributed processing system due to reduced feedstock<br>
transportation distance. The additional processing required by the proposed<br>
distributed P&amp;D system may increase operating and processing costs at that<br>
location, but replace similar processing costs at the centralized processing<br>
facility. Additionally, the uniformity and densification of the raw material may<br>
yield significant advantages for large-scale material handling, storage and<br>
production. Quantifying these potential advantages will be a key outcome of the<br>
proposed project.<br>
These studies will optimize the AFEX process for both pretreatment and<br>
subsequent densification; develop and optimize the densification process for<br>
pellet formation; determine physical characteristics of pellets before and after<br>
storage; evaluate hydrolysis and fermentation of fresh and stored pellets; and<br>
conduct an in-depth economic and energy analysis of the process.<br>
Techno-economic models will be developed for the AFEX and<br>
densification processes using data collected above. Delivered feedstock costs<br>
will be based on informed estimates. Optimization methods (e.g., linear<br>
programming) will be used to minimize overall costs and determine an optimum<br>
and minimum capacity for the pretreatment &amp; densification facility. The analysis<br>
will then compare the regional biomass processing center (RBPC) versus<br>
traditional systems without combined pretreatment and densification.<br>
Costs associated with pretreatment and densification of biomass in RBPC<br>
will be studied, including optimal and minimal scale of RBPCs; sensitivity<br>
analysis to elucidate the variables with greatest impact capital and operating<br>
costs; a comparison of decentralized and centralized systems; and a rationale to<br>
assist in facility location relative to main biorefinery.<br>
43<br>
An economic model will be developed to provide decision-making<br>
capability to those adopting decentralized pretreatment and densification<br>
technology. See, for example Flowchart 1 below:<br>

The logistics of harvesting, handling, transporting, and storing low bulk<br>
density feedstocks is a significant challenge to the bioeconomy. These issues are<br>
especially critical for herbaceous feedstocks, which may have low per-acre<br>
productivities. For example, biomass that yields 70 gallons of ethanol per ton,<br>
baled at a density of 120 Kg/m^ would require over 10 times the volume of<br>
material for a given volume of ethanol, compared with com grain. Therefore,<br>
biomass densification at distributed locations (to minimize transport of feedstock<br>
bales) is critically needed, but conventional extrusion pelleting has proven too<br>
costly.<br>
44<br>
Conclusion<br>
Novel densified biomass products and methods for making and using<br>
same are described herein. In one embodiment, an AFEX pretreatment is used to<br>
produce a tacky biomass which, surprisingly, is easily convertible to a solid<br>
briquette or pellet without the use of additional binder. The AFEX pellets are<br>
also surprisingly at least as dense and demonstrate superior hardness properties<br>
as compared with conventional pellets containing added binders.<br>
In one embodiment, pellets comprising more than one type of biomass<br>
material (e.g., com stover, grasses, wood, and the like) is provided. In this way,<br>
a commodity pelleted biomass product having relatively uniform properties<br>
which may be more easily adopted into the biomass processing industry, can be<br>
provided. Such properties may include, but are not limited to, BTU content,<br>
sugar content, and so forth.<br>
Any suitable type of densification process may be used to produce<br>
products having a variety of sizes and shapes. In one embodiment, the<br>
densification process device uses a gear mesh system to compress biomass<br>
through a tapering channel between adjacent gear teeth, forming high density<br>
pellets. In one embodiment, the system operates at lower temperature, pressure,<br>
and energy requirements than comparable pelleting systems.<br>
In one embodiment, the AFEX pellets "hold up" better, i.e., are more<br>
resistant to physical forces, than non-AFEX pellets during shipping, handling<br>
and/or storing. In one embodiment, the resulting products have an increased<br>
flowability as compared with conventional biomass solids, which allow for<br>
automated loading and unloading of transport vehicles and storage systems, as<br>
well as transport through the processing facility.<br>

may be used. This application is intended to cover any adaptations or variations<br>
