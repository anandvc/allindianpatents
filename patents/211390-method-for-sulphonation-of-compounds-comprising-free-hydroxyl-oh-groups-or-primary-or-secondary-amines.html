COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
METHOD  FOR SULpHONATION OF  COMPOUNDS  COMPRISING  FREE HYDROXYL (OH), GROUPS OR PRIMARY OR SECONDARY AMINES<br>
ORGANES, TISSUS : REGENERATION, REPARATION, REMPLACEMENT-OTR3 of 33, RUE PIERRE BROSSOLETTE, F-94000 CRETEIL, FRANCE, FRENCH Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
The present invention has as object a method for the preparation of sulfated compounds under reproducible, nondegrading conditions compatible with the uses of said compounds in which a precise molecular definition must be described such as, for example, in the case of therapeutic agents.<br>
The method of the invention is applicable to all monomeric, oligomeric and polymeric compounds comprising free hydroxyl (OH) groups or optionally substituted primary or secondary amines. The invention pertains more particularly to an O and N sulfonation method for functionalized polymers.<br>
The methods for the preparation of sulfated compounds reported in the prior art generally induce cleavage of the chains of the polymers during the O or N sulfonation and thus the formation of potentially toxic reactional residues. The method according to the present invention has as object precisely the avoidance of this drawback by enabling the controlled addition of sulfonate groups under controlled conditions such that the structural integrity of the initial polymer, e.g., an oligosaccharide, is not altered.<br>
Known in the prior art are functionalized polymers with anticoagulant properties and notably a family of derivatives obtained by substitutions on a dextran (D) chain of the carboxymethyl (CM), methyl-benzylamide (B) and methyl-benzylamide sulfonate (S) groups, designated by the abbreviation CMDBS. The methods for the preparation of these polymers were described in particular in the French patent published as no. 2 461 724, as well as in the US patent published as no. 4,740,594. Neither of these patents provides a precise analysis of the resultant polymeric structures and the methods described do not enable providing evidence that the resultant products are homogeneous. The experimental conditions of the sulfonation reaction described in these patents promote the binding of the sulfones to the free OH groups of the glucoside residue and the analysis presented does not enable the clear demonstration of the presence of benzylamine sulfonate.<br>
Other members of the CMDBS family, designated HBGF for "Heparin Binding Growth Factor", were described as cicatrization agents in the US patent published as no. 5,693,625. HBFGPPs were also described for their properties of stimulating the repair and regeneration of lesions induced in muscle tissues (French patent no. 2 718 024), nervous tissues (French patent no. 2 718 026) and digestive tract tissues (French<br>
2<br><br>
patent no. 2 718 023) as well as for their anti-inflammatory properties (French patent no. 2 718 025). These patents established a series of functional criteria for screening among all the biocompatible polymers those that respond to the following four functional properties:<br>
-	Protecting the heparin binding growth factors (HBGFs) like the fibroblast growth factors such as FGF1 &amp; 2 or the transforming factors such as TGF-P against proteolytic degradations as well as potentiating their biological activities in a series of tests on cell cultures.<br>
-	Presenting an anticoagulant activity of less than 10 international units per mg.<br>
-	Inhibiting the activity of leukocyte elastase under physiological conditions.<br>
-	Inhibiting the activity of plasmin under physiological conditions.<br>
French patent application no. 98 08309 reports the structure of a family of polymers, designated RGTA for "ReGeneraTing Agent", presenting the properties of the HBGFPPs and describes the method for their preparation and their properties. The RGTAs present antifibrotic effects notably enabling improvement in the quality of cutaneous cicatrices, antioxidant effects notably for treating the deleterious effects of free radicals (after ionizing radiation, or during the oxidative stress induced by ischemia) and properties of regulating tissue homeostasis notably of bone masses. These properties supplement those described for the HBGFPPs.<br>
The polymers described in French patent no. 98 09309 respond to the following formula:<br>
AaXxYy        (I) in which:<br>
A is a monomer; X represents an RCOOR" group; Y represents an O- or N-sulfonate group bound on A and responding to either of the following formulas: ROS03R" or RNS03R"; the R groups are aliphatic hydrocarbon chains optionally branched and/or unsaturated and which can contain one or more aromatic rings with the exception of benzylamine and benzylamine sulfonate; R" represents a hydrogen atom or a cation; a represents the number of monomers; x represents the level or degree of substitution of the A monomers by the X groups; y represents the level or degree of substitution of the A monomers by the Y groups.<br>
3<br><br>
Among the polymers described in French patent no. 98 09309, we can cite the dextran derivatives such as CMDS. Polymers of the CMDS type have also been described as anticoagulants (Maiga et al., Carbohydrate Polymers, 1997,32,89-93).<br>
In all of these examples of the prior art, the synthesis methods described do not make it possible to obtain products in accordance with the criteria of sufficient reproducibility assuring the maintenance of molecular integrity and the absence of contaminants. In fact, although the methods for the substitution of carboxyl groups are widely described in the prior art and make possible controlled and managed substitution ensuring sufficient reproducibility, the sulfonation methods are more difficult to control.<br>
The sulfonation methods are performed at a very acid pH value which does not enable preservation of the integrity of the polymer chain especially if this chain is constituted by natural sugars. Moreover, these sulfonation conditions lead to decarboxylations that are very difficult to control.<br>
Thus, numerous studies in the prior art describe methods enabling the sulfatation of polysaccharides of type Aa. Thus, for example, dextran sulfate (or O-sulfonate) (DS), carboxymethyl dextran sulfate (CM-D-S) (or O-sulfonate) and other sulfated (or O-sulfonated) oligosaccharides such as xylan and starch were sulfated (or O-sulfonated) by methods of the type described in US patent no. 4,814,437. Among these methods, those proposing sulfonation of polysaccharides using strong acids as sulfonation agents were reported by numerous authors. For example, US patents no. 4,740,594 and no. 4,755,379, and French patent no. 2 772 382 describe a treatment with chlorosulfonic acid using dichloromethane (CH2CI2) as solvent for the production of molecules of the CM-D-S and DM-D-B-S type. This method was already widely described in these older studies because the same acid was used for the synthesis of DS with pyridine as solvent of a basic nature (Ricketts, Biochem J, 51,210-233,1952). Sulfuric add and sulfonic acid in the presence of formamide were also used for the preparation of DS at low temperatures as described in US patents no. 3,498,972 and 3,141,014. It is known that these strongly acid reaction conditions induce the partial degradation of the products even in the presence of solvents of a basic nature or at low temperatures. They lead to a noteworthy fragmentation of the macromolecular chain in the case of polymer products and a partial hydrolysis of<br>
4	.   ..     ■   "<br><br>
certain functional groups contained in the molecules to be sulfonated. Many improvements have been introduced with regard to these strong acidity conditions involving the use of better buffered media or media of lower acidity. Thus, the use of sulfur trioxide (SO3) complexes as sulfonation agents less severe than sulfuric and sulfonic acids has already been introduced (Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics, 95, 36-41, 1961; Tetrahedron Letters, 29, 7, 803-806, 1988; J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1,157,1995). Many complexes of the SO3 amine type have been made available commercially such as SO3-ME3N (trimethylamine), SCVEtsN (triethylamine), SO3-pyridine and S03-piperidine. These reagents are used in an anhydrous medium in solvents such as DMF, formamide and DMSO. Although these methods are used for the production of sulfated polysaccharides, especially those derived from dextran, functionalized by ester, ether or amid groups, they present major drawbacks because they lead to:<br>
-	the random fragmentation of the macromolecular chain of the polymers, albeit in lower proportions than with sulfonic acids;<br>
-	a partial hydrolysis of the functional groups already present on the polymers cited above; and<br>
-	the generation of secondary products by formation of amines which contaminate the preparations and which have been shown to be toxic after inoculation in vivo (Brain Res, 16,208-2,473-478,1981).<br>
These techniques have been still further improved in order to eliminate to the maximum extent possible the toxic residues as well as to propose for pyridine the method described in US patent no. 4,814,437. In fact, the S03-amines used in this method of the prior art are reactive with the aldehyde groups present on the reducing end of most of the polysaccharides, notably in dextran, and the bond formed in this manner is covalent and thus permanent.<br>
The disadvantage of the use of complexes of the SCVamine type was also overcome by employing S03-amine type complexes such as SO3-DMF and SO3-FA. For example, the salts of DS, more particularly the sodium salts, are presently prepared as described in US patent no. 4,855,416 by O-sulfonation of dextran by an SO3 complex associated with formamide (SO3-FA) with formamide as solvent. This method comprises the formation in situ of the SO3-FA complex and then its reaction<br>
5<br><br>
with dextran. The strong reactivity of the SO3-FA complex induces a strong acidity of the reactional medium despite the use of an inert atmosphere (N2) and anhydrous solvents. This fact also leads to the degradation of the macromolecular chain.<br>
Another widely used non-animated complex is SO3-DMF. It was in fact proposed in French patent no. 2 772 382 for the synthesis of sulfated polysaccharides of the CM-D-S and CM-D-B-S type. However, the SO3-DMF complex, like the SO3-FA complex, produces a strong acidity of the reaction medium, which also leads to the fragmentation of the macromolecular chain and the hydrolysis of the labile hydrolysis groups resulting in a loss of control of the synthesis and the final products. This method is thus as imperfect as the other methods in the case of the preparation of high-molecular-weight polyanionic polymers which it is not desired to cleave in a random, uncontrolled manner.<br>
It was with this desire to improve the synthesis methods that the protocols for producing CMDBS and CMDS were described in French patent no. 97 15702. According to French patent no. 9715702, this improvement enables on the one hand the production of dextran derivatives presenting a greater homogeneity of molecular weight and on the other hand the control of the substitution rates thus ensuring a greater homogeneity of the structures and thus a better definition. However, like the prior art, the method described in French patent no. 97 15702 is based on the sulfonation of polysaccharides using an S03-amine (DMF, pyridine or triethylamine) and the examples presented are exclusively obtained with SO3-pyridine. This method moreover leads to the formation of residual traces of pyridine, the human toxicity of which is well known, and does not appear to enable the absence of formation of fragments of the polysaccharide chain.<br>
The present invention has precisely as object the offering of new general sulfonation methods making it possible to control with a high level of rigor and precision the conditions of the substitutions of the sulfonate groups on compounds containing hydroxyl functional group or primary or secondary amine functional groups.<br>
This goal is achieved by means of a method for the sulfonation of a compound presenting one or more free hydroxyl functional groups and/or one or more optionally substituted primary or secondary amine functional groups/characterized<br>
6<br><br>
in that it comprises treatment of said compound with the SO3-DMF complex in the presence of an acid capture agent.<br>
The term "acid capture agent" is understood to mean a substance or mixture of substances capable of reacting selectively with the free protons in solution. After the addition of this acid capture agent to the reaction medium, the protons are trapped by the acid capture agent and no longer participate in the reduction of the pH value because they are no longer reactive.<br>
The acid capture agent is, for example, selected from the group comprising: alkenes or alkines with a boiling point lower than 100°C or a mixture of these two.<br>
The acid capture agent is advantageously a butene such as 2-methyl-2-butene (2M2B), 2-methyl-propene, 2-methyl-pentene or their isomers or a mixture of them.<br>
The method according to the invention is remarkable in this it makes it possible to avoid the use of excessively acid pH values and thus to eliminate the risk of cleavage of the treated compounds. The invention moreover presents the advantage of not introducing toxic substances that are difficult or impossible to eliminate completely.<br>
The method according to the invention more particularly comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	solubilization or preparation of a homogeneous solution of the compound to be sulfonated in an anhydrous solvent or cosolvent such as dimethylformamide (DMF) or a cosolvent composed of formamide and dimethylformamide;<br>
b)	addition at ambient temperature (20-22°C) of a molar excess of an acid capture agent, such as 2-methyl-2-butene, miscible in the cosolvent;<br>
c)	rapid addition of the SO3-DMF complex under agitation;<br>
d)	agitation of the mixture obtained in the preceding step for one to two hours at a controlled temperature below 30°C;<br>
e)	stopping the reaction by progressive addition of the mixture to an alkaline<br>
solution, e.g., a 2% solution of sodium bicarbonate acid (NaHCCk) or another alkali,<br>
with monitoring of the pH value such that it is never lower than 4 so as to obtain the,<br>
salts of the compound to be sulfonated.	<br>
7<br><br>
The method of the invention advantageously comprises the purification of the sulfonated compound obtained in step:-(e), e.g., by tangential ultrafiltration against water (the waterybeing of the quality of water for human injection) via an ultrafiltration membrane at a cutoff threshold of 1000 dalton.<br>
The solvent employed in step (a) is preferably not dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) because studies carried out in the framework of the present invention revealed that this solvent is very difficult to eliminate from the sulfonated polysaccharide preparations and thus constitutes an obstacle for their use in the preparation of pharmaceutical forms.<br>
When the compound to be sulfonated is poorly soluble in an anhydrous solvent or cosolvent, a particular form of implementation of the method consists of the protonarion of said compound in order to promote its solubilization. We are dealing here notably with compounds to be sulfonated which are polymers of a sugar, such as dextran, substituted by one or more carboxylate groups, the protonation of which leads to the formation of -COOH groups, e.g., by passage on a cation exchange column.<br>
The sulfonation conditions are thus sufficiently managed and controlled so as to avoid decarboxylation of the polymer initially substituted by carboxyl groups. The sulfonation conditions are consequently advantageously the following:<br>
The polymer to be sulfonated is dissolved in an anhydrous solvent (see, e.g., example II.l). A molar excess of acid capture agent (such as the alkene 2M2B) is added. The sulfonation reagent (SO3) such as the complex SO3-DMF is added and the reaction proceeds at a temperature lower than the evaporation temperature of the acid capture agent. The reaction is stopped by the addition of an alkaline solution such as NaHC03.<br>
The method of the invention is applicable to monomers, oligomers and polymers. It is most particularly suited to polymers such as the previously defined HBGFPPs and RGTAs, and thus especially to compounds derived from dextrans and copolymers of malic acids. The invention thus is especially applicable to polymers of formula:<br>
AaXxYy	(I)<br>
8<br><br>
in which:<br>
A is a monomer; X represents an RCOOR" group; Y represents an O- or N-sulfonate group bound on A and responding to either of the following formulas: ROS03R" or RNS03R"; the R groups are aliphatic hydrocarbon chains optionally branched and/or unsaturated and which can contain one or more aromatic rings with the exception of benzylamine and benzylamine sulfonate; R" represents a hydrogen atom or a cation; a represents the number of monomers; x represents the level or degree of substitution of the A monomers by the X groups; y represents the level or degree of substitution of -the A monomers by the Y groups.<br>
The method of the invention can be implemented on polymers, notably those of formula (I), in which the bonds between the monomers or between the monomers and their substituents, such as the A-A or A-X bonds of the polymers of formula (I), are comprised by functional groups that are unstable in an acid medium, notably ester, amide, ether, acetal (osidic) functional groups or other groups.<br>
The method of the invention is thus most especially suited to the preparation of monomeric or oligomeric sulfated sugars such as certain heparin fragments, or for polymers of the RGTA family notably when A is an osidic monomer as in the case of dextran-based polymers or all other polysaccharide compounds.<br>
Other advantages and characteristics of the invention will become apparent from the examples below regarding the implementation of the method of the invention with reference to the attached drawings in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is a graphic representation of a CMDS molecule in which the terminal aldehyde is shown. For a CMDS in which the values x and y are different than 0, there are three types of Z units: a) aldehyde or semiacetal, b) carboxymethyl glucoside and c) sulfonate glucoside.<br>
-	Figure 2 represents the equilibrium between the aldehyde functional group and the semiacetal of the terminal unit of a substituted dextran. The substituted unit in anomeric position no longer participates in the equilibrium.<br>
-	Figure 3 represents the chromatographic profile of a type CMDS molecule with the structural characteristics described in table 3<br>
9<br><br>
-	Figure 4 shows the chromatographic profiles obtained by the same product PA 07 on different gel filtration columns.<br>
-	Figure 5 presents the structure of CMDS.<br>
These examples also comprise the comparison of the method of the invention with those of the prior art, notably for the sulfonation of polymers derived from dextran such as the CMDSs and CMDBSs. This comparison shows that the protocols proposed in French patents no. FR 97 15702 and no. FR 99 07636 do not make it possible to obtain a good preservation of the molecular integrity of the dextran polymers because they generate fragmentations that can be detected and quantified by simple methods as well as the hydrolysis of groups grafted on the inacromolecular chains.<br>
f - Evaluation of the sulfonation<br>
1.1	- Methods for the measurement of the carboxylic and sulfonate groups<br>
In order to allow comparisons among the different sulfonation methods, we measured the degree of substitution (ds) of carboxyl groups (x) and sulfonate groups (y) per unit of glucose. Dextran being a glucose polymer, it possesses 3 reactive OH groups on each glucose unit. The theoretical maximum is therefore 3. rhe quantitative determinations were performed by titrimetric methods and by slemental analysis according to the usual protocols described in the prior art.<br>
The titrimetric determination in combination with the elemental analysis allows determination of the global substitution rates (x and y) of the carboxymethyl ether (x) and sulfonate (y) groups.<br>
I..2	- Determination of the position of the substitution groups<br>
In order to be able to specify the position of the groups grafted on the osidic units, we used a NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance of the Proton) analysis method under the standard conditions known by the expert in the field (J. Biol. Chem., 275, 38,29383-29390,2000). We used a Bruker 200-MHz spectrometer.<br>
10<br><br>
1.3	- Method for measuring the fragmentation of the poly-osidic chains<br>
In order to measure the integrity of the polymeric chain before and after the addition reaction of the sulfonate groups, the aldehydes present in the product in solution were determined.<br>
The determination of the aldehydes enabled determination of the reducing terminal units of the products because only the reducing terminal end of the polymer presents an aldehyde group as shown in figure 1. Thus the number of aldehyde groups was determined on the product to be sulfonated. The number in this case is equal to 1 micromole of aldehyde per gram of product. This value must remain in all cases less than or equal to the value of the initial product if there were no formation of cleavages during the reaction.<br>
In fact, the free aldehyde value measured after the sulfonation reaction was less than the value measured prior to the introduction of the sulfonate groups (1.0 micromole/g for a CMDS at 0.5 mmole/g). The free aldehyde values usually found for a CMDS type product in which x = 0.5 and y = 1.25 are close to 0.4 micromoles of aldehyde per gram of product. In contrast, if this number exceeds the initial value (1.0), there is necessarily formation of cleavages.<br>
This method thus enables measurement of the formation of fragments because each chain cleavage generates a new detectable, reactive aldehyde.<br>
1.4	Method for measuring the molecular weights and studying the apparent<br>
homogeneity of the preparation<br>
Measurement of the molecular weights is performed by high-performance steric exclusion chromatography in 0.1 M NaNC»3 on columns of KB-804 and KB-805 filtration gel (Shodex Japan) in series at 0.7 ml/min. The products are detected at the column outlet by a Dawn light scattering mini-detector and a refractometer of type RID 10 (J. Biol. Chem. 275, 38, 29383-29390, 2000). the homogeneity of the preparation is reflected by the distribution curve of the molecular weights and the measurement of the width (at half height) of the peak as well as by the measurement of the symmetry of the curve.<br>
11<br><br>
A second HPLC-gel filtration technique can reveal the homogeneity of the molecule with regard to distribution of the molecular weights. A Gaussian distribution is shown in figure 3.<br>
The chromatographic conditions are: Column: TSKgelG4000PWX (TOSOHAAS) at 30°C, 7.8 mm ID x 30 cm; mobile phase: NaCl 0.3 M; flow rate: 0.7 ml/min; detection: IR 0.06.<br>
It was found that for the products synthesized according to the techniques using the S03-amine complexes, the homogeneity of the preparation varied according to the chromatographic system employed.<br>
When the product was separated by Shodex columns the peak was asymmetrical but when the second chromatographic separation system was used, the peak corresponding to the same product appeared symmetrical as shown in figure 4. This indicates that the homogeneity of the dispersion of molecular weights in these preparations as well as those of the prior art is relative to the separation system employed.<br>
II - Example of O-sulfonation of carhoxymethyl dextran employing the method of the invention and in comparison with the prior art<br>
Different O-sulfonation reactions by reagents such as chlorosulfonic acid, or by S03-amine complexes, the SO3-DMF complex, and the SO3-DMF complex in the presence of the acid capture agent 2-methyl-2-butene (SO3-DMF/2M2B), object of the present invention, are described in the examples below.<br>
In order to establish these comparisons, carboxymethyl was selected as initial polymer.<br>
II.1 - Reaction in the presence of the acid capture agent with the complex SO3-DMF/l"methyl-2-butene<br>
In a 500-ml flask, 5 g of acid form carboxymethyl dextran (CMDH+) (24.27 mmol) was dissolved in 40 ml of formamide, then 40 ml of 2-methyl-2-butene (25 equivalents) was added under agitation. 7.90 g of SO3-DMF (5 equivalents per unit of glucose) was added. The reaction progressed for 2 hours at 30°C under agitation.<br>
12<br><br>
The reaction was stopped by very slowly pouring the reaction medium into 200 ml of NaHC03 at 2%. The pH must be close to 7. If this is not the case, the solution is neutralized by addition of soda or HCl. The pH value of the solution must never fall below 5 in any case in order to avoid degradation of the products.<br>
After elimination of the excess water, the DMF and the 2M2B by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure, the product was reduced by tangential ultrafiltration followed by lyophilization. Six g of sulfonated product was obtained in the form of a white powder.<br>
Table 1 below indicates the reproducibility of the O-sulfonation of CMDH+ (x = 0.52) with 5 equivalents of SO3-DMF and 25 equivalents of 2M2B per unit of glucose. The mean deviation (MD) percentage should be examined with regard to products prepared from the same CMD.<br>

Ten independent manipulations were performed according to this protocol: five were performed strictly following the same protocol with 5 equivalents of SO3-DMF and 25 equivalents of 2M2B in accordance with table 1, entries 1 to 4. Five others were performed while varying the amount of reagent S03-DMF/2M2B from 2 to 5 equivalents of reagent per unit of glucose. The ratio of SO3-DMF to 2M2B remained constant at 1:5 (table 2, entries 1 to 5).<br>
The results shows that the method is reproducible for producing products possessing ether groups and osidic bonds.<br>
In all cases, the mean deviation (MD) percentage was lower than the maximum limit set at 10%.<br>
It should be noted that (x) does not vary significantly (MD 
The molecular weight measurements confirm the absence of heterogeneity (figure 3 corresponding to the product described in table 1, entry 4) MW = 67,500 ± 7500.<br>
The results obtained demonstrate that in the presence of 2M2B, the sulfonation rates obtained were a function of the stoichiometric of the reaction. Moreover, the reaction conditions did not affect the levels of carboxyethyl ether groups previously grafted on the CMD.<br>
II.2 - Definition of the molecule by NMR analysis of the proton<br>

The analysis of the synthesized products was performed using analytic techniques including titrimetric quantitative determination, elemental analysis, quantitative analysis of reducing sugars and HPLC/filtration on gel combined with MALLS detection supplemented by 1H NMR spectroscopy.<br>
The lH NMR spectroscopy provided us with the position and the ratio of the substitution rates of the different groups on the 3 reactional hydroxyls at C-2 and C-3,4 of the osidic units of the initial dextran. Table 3 below indicates the position of the X and Y substitutions on A by NMR analysis in the example type CM-D-S dextran. Table 3<br>

III - Comparison with the prior art<br>
II1.1 - O-sulfonation by chlorosulfonic acid. Reaction with CISO3H<br>
Five g of carboxymethyl dextran (24.27 mmol, one equivalent per unit of glucose) was added to 162 ml of dichloromethane.  A heterogeneous mixture was<br>
15<br><br>
obtained.    The mixture was intensely agitated so as to obtain a homogeneous suspension of the product in dichloromethane.<br>
1.5 ml of chlorosulfonic acid (24.27 mmol, one equivalent per unit of glucose) was slowly added to the mixture. The reaction medium was maintained under agitation for 2 hours. Agglomerates of products of a brown color formed during the reaction. The mixture was filtered (on fritted glass no. 4) and the recovered product was washed twice with 100 ml of dichloromethane, 3 times with 100 ml of a dichloromethane/dioxane (1:1) mixture and a final time with 100 ml of dioxane. The resultant product was dissolved in 200 ml of distilled water and the solution was brought to pH 9.5 by addition of soda at 2 M and then pH 7 by addition of HC1 at0.05mol/l.<br>
The solution was filtered, concentrated and precipitated by 500 ml of methanol. The resultant precipitate was then dried in an oven prior to being purified.<br>
Three independent manipulations were performed according to this protocol: One with one equivalent of chlorosulfonic acid at ambient temperature. One with two equivalents of chlorosulfonic acid at ambient temperature. One with two equivalents of chlorosulfonic acid at 4°C.<br>
111.2 - Reaction with SO3" amine and amide complexes<br>
The protocols outlined above were implemented using different complexes based on SO3: S03-pyridine, S03-trimethylamine, S03-triethylamine and SO3-DMF (dimethyl formamide).<br>
Table 4 below indicates the structural and biological characteristics of the products obtained by O-sulfonation of a CMD (d.s. C = 0.56) by the different complexes of SO3.<br>
In a 500-ml flask, 5 g of carboxymethyl dextran (24.27 mmol, one equivalent per unit of glucose) was dissolved in 50 ml of formamide. To promote the dissolution of the carboxymethyl dextran, the temperature of the reaction medium was brought to 50°C. Once the product was solubilized, the solution was brought to ambient temperature. For each reaction performed, a solution containing each of the complexes shown in table 4 below was prepared independently in 50 ml of<br>
16<br><br>
formamide and with the addition of the carboxymethyl dextran solution under agitation. The reaction advanced ior 2 h at ambient temperature.<br>
The reaction was stopped by adding 21 of distilled water at 4°C. Mixing was performed and the pH of the medium was brought to 7.5-8 by the addition of a NaOH 2M solution.<br>
After elimination of the excess water by rotary evaporation at reduced pressure the product was purified by tangential ultrafiltration followed by lyophilization. Six g of sulfated product was obtained in the form of a white powder.<br>
Four independent manipulations were performed according to this protocol:<br>
One with two equivalents of S03-pyridine complex at ambient temperature;<br>
One   with   two   equivalents   of   S03-trimethylamine   complex   at   ambient<br>
temperature;<br>
One with two equivalents of S03-triethylamine complex at ambient temperature;<br>
One with two equivalents of SO3-DMF complex at ambient temperature.<br>
Furthermore, a reaction (table 4, line 8) was performed precisely according to the protocol described in example 5 of French patent no. FR 97 15702, in which the solubilization of CMD was obtained by the formation of trimethylammonium salts. The S03-pyridine in a complex molar ratio of free OH equal to 0.4 (which corresponds to 2 equivalents of complex per unit of glucose) was dissolved in DMSO and added to the polymer solution. The reaction was carried out in dimethylformamide at ambient temperature.<br>
Table 4 shows the structural characteristics of various polymers of type CMDS synthesized according to the different methods and the constraints of each method. The method according to the invention corresponds to entries 10 and 11 of table 4 and the conditions described in example no. 1.<br>

* the initial product of this experiment was substituted in CM at 1 residue per unit of glucose.<br>
The different products of the DCS type were synthesized from a single batch of carboxylated dextran (table 4, entry 1) with a degree of substitution in carboxylate of x = 0.56. After their purification, the products were characterized by the different structural analysis techniques.<br>
The titrimetric results showed that the O-sulfonation reactions by chlorosulfuric acid and the S03-amide or amine complexes induced a cleavage of the ether bond of the grafted carboxyl groups (dsC or x) and a degradation of the macromolecular chain (molecular weight and quantitative determination of the<br>
18<br><br>
reducing sugars). This cleavage becomes more pronounced as the number of reagent equivalents added is increased. Reduction of the temperature of the reaction medium can limit this degradation.<br>
It should be noted that the product prepared by the complex SO3Et3N (table 4, entry 6) was the most sulfonated product but also the product having undergone the greatest decarboxylation. This tendency was confirmed by the other products.<br>
The last two entries of the table (entries 10 and 11) employed the product 2M2B which acts as an acid capture agent in order to limit the degradation of the ether bonds of the grafted carboxylate groups and of the macromolecular chain and the degradation of the chain.<br>
It should be noted that in the presence of the product 2M2B the dsC of the product obtained after sulfonation was identical to that of the precursor dsC. This was the case irrespective of the amount of reagent added. In fact, with 2.5 times more of complex SO3-DMF (entry 11), we obtained a higher dsS but above all the dsC did not change. The efficacy of the protocol of 2M2B is thereby demonstrated.<br>
Whereas for the previously known O-sulfonation techniques there is decarboxylation and degradation of the macromolecular chain, the O-sulfonation technique in the presence of the product 2M2B makes it possible to resolve the problem of the loss of the carboxylate groups grafted on the dextran. The measurements of in vivo activities as well as in vivo toxicity were performed on muscle regeneration models of the muscle extensor digitorum longus of the rear paw of the adult rat after crushing according to the experimental conditions described in Gautron J., Kedzia C, Husmann I. and Barritault D. "Acceleration of the regeneration of an adult rat skeletal muscle by dextran derivatives", C. R. Acad. Sc. Paris, Sciences de la Vie (1995), 318: 671-676. The regeneration is quantified on histological sections by measurement of the number of regenerated muscle fibers. The toxicity was measured by a diminishment of the formation of fibers (compared to the controls injected by a solution of physiological serum) as well as by the analysis of the appearance of the regeneration and the revelation of abnormal zones of regeneration or the formation of abnormal zones or the formation of inflammatory zones showing a degeneration of the muscle tissues.<br>
