				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the [preparation of photoreceptors<br>
useful for xeroradiography.<br>
Xeroradiography (XR) is used in medical applications'as an X-ray imaging technique<br>
in radiology especially in the diagnosis of mammography, i.e., detection of breast cancer at an<br>
early stage, and also in some special extremities cases where its unique imaging<br>
characteristics such as edge enhancement and wider recording latitude provides superior<br>
diagnostic advantages over the conventionally used film-screen radiology. XR technique is<br>
based on the well known Xerox process. In this technique a specially prepared plate known<br>
as the xeroradiography phbtoreceptor is used as an X-ray imaging media. This plate is<br>
charged positively using the well known corona discharge technique and kept in dark using a<br>
metallic shutter which prevents the dissipation of charge on the plate as it is sensitive to light<br>
radiations. This charged plate is now exposed to X-ray via the object to be imaged which<br>
results in the dissipation of charge on the plate in proportion to the X-ray intensity falling on<br>
different parts of the plate. This results in the formation of the image in the form of remaining<br>
charge pattern on the plate which is called the electrostatic latent image. The image is not visible at this stage. It is made visible by the development process, i.e., developing it by using<br>
a special type of ink called the Toner'. The image at this 'stage itself can be used for<br>
diagnosis. However, to keep a permanent record of the image it is transferred onto an<br>
ordinary paper by electrostatic means. The image is fixed on the paper by using chemical<br>
solvents,     heating      techniques.     This     complete    Xeroradiography     process<br>
takes	about	1	to	2	minutes      only.       Therefore,    in<br>
addition        to	the     diagnostic       superiorities      of      Xeroradiography<br>
mentioned earlier this technique is also commercially viable and<br>
quick  as   compared     to     the  conventional   filial-screen .radiology.<br>
The most vital constituent of XR process described above<br>
is the xeroradiography plate/photoreceptor (XRP)  on  which<br>
depends primarily the quality of  XR images .i.e., its contrast,<br>
resolution,definition,etc,.   The  XRP constitutes of  a  vacuum<br>
deposited layer of a knowia X-ray conducting material such as pure/doped amorphous selenium on a conducting aluminium<br>
substrate.   Reference may be made to the US Patent No.4,770,965<br>
to  Fender et al and the other patents referred there-in for  the<br>
art  of  state  existing for the preparartion of XRP  using  the<br>
conventional vacuum deposition technique. Hentlon has been made<br>
in these references about the material compositions used  in<br>
manufacturing the XRP,i.e.,  selenium doped and alloyed with<br>
suitable materials such as chlorine, arsenic ,etc.   Mention has<br>
also been made of the preparation process of XRP where substrate<br>
temperature  (Ts ) during deposition has been maintained between<br>
71°C to 80°C. ' It is important to mention there that the TS used in these investigations has a possible drawback and it is that the Ts used is on a higher side and there is always a possibility<br>
of netting undeaired crystalline contents in the deposited films<br>
because  the ideal requirement of the deposited films  for  X-ray<br>
imaging  is the complete amorphousity and 'no crstalline  content<br>
but at the same time free from artifacts and defects which indeed<br>
in known to depend on Ts ;higher the T- lower is the number of<br>
these defects.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to  provide an<br>
improved process for  the preparation of photoreceptors for<br>
xeroradiography using the  vacuum deposition technique which<br>
obviates the drawbacks of the hitherto known processes.<br>
Another object is to provide photoreceptors made by: the improved process of the<br>
present invention.<br>
In the process of present invention the need to reduce the substrate temperatures<br>
during deposition to get better amorphousity in the films -and also without introducing<br>
additional detects in the films is achieved.<br>
In the improved process of the present invention we have introduced a new step in the vacuum deposition process. The step introduced is heating the substrate in vacuum, prior<br>
to vacuum deposition, to a temperature in the range of 100°C to 130°C and then cooling it in<br>
vacuum to a temperature in the range of 50°C to 65°C and; then starting the process of<br>
deposition. This new invented step enables, prior to deposition! in complete degassing of the<br>
substrate and also making it free from any remaining! impurities, traces, etc. (the known<br>
sources of defects, etc.), due to the simultaneous application of .heat and vacuum. This in turn<br>
enables to deposit the films at reduced temperature i.e., in the range of 57°C to 72°C.<br>
Therefore, this invented process of deposition meets both  the requirements of higher amorphousity and less defects/artifacts in the films.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the preparation<br>
of photoreceptors useful for xeroradiography which comprises cleaning thoroughly an<br>
aluminium substrate by conventional methods, heating the said substrate in vacuum ≥ 10-5 Torr, prior to deposition, to a temperature in the range of 100°C to 130°C, cooling the<br>
substrate in vacuum to a temperature in the range of 50°C to 65°C, vacuum depositing<br>
pure/suitably doped selenium onto the said substrate maintained at a temperature in the<br>
range of 57°C to 72°C to obtain photoreceptors.<br><br>
in the range 57° C to 72 C.<br>
The  conventional  methods used for cleaning  the  sustrate<br>
thoroughly may be  washing with  detergents,followed  by  final<br>
cleaning and decreasing using ultrasonic cleaner.<br>
Prior  to  deposition  the cleaned substrate  is  heated  in<br>
vacuum preferably to a temperature in the range of 110 C to 120 C<br>
and  then cooled down in vacuum to a temperature in the range  of<br>
55°C to 60°C.<br>
the  vacuum deposition  of  pure/doped  sjelenium way  be   effected<br>
at a rate in the range 2.5  µm to 3.5  µm per minute.<br>
The improved process of the present Invention starts with<br>
the thorough cleaning of the aluminium substrate.  In the process<br>
developed  this cleaning was achieved in two steps namely the<br>
pre-cleaning and the final cleaning.  The precleaning involved<br>
'washing the subbatrate with soap solution!detergents,etc., and<br>
rinsing it thoroughly with water. This removed the dust,contamin-<br>
tion,etc,visible on the substrate.  The plate was then dried and<br>
put into an ultrasonic machine for final cleaning.  This machine<br>
contained two tanks one the ultrasonic  and the other vapour degreaser.  The chemical used for  cleaning in both the tanks was<br>
trichloroethylene.  The plate was first put for about  5 minutes<br>
in the ultrasonic cleaner and then for about 5 minutes in the<br>
vapour degreaser.  This process resulted in  the desired cleaning<br>
and degreasing of  the substrate.  The cleaned substrate was then<br>
put in a specially designed frame and loaded in the vacuum chamber<br>
for vacuum deposition.   The vacuum chamber contained a boat  of<br>
quartz specially designed and used for keeping the material to be<br>
vacuum deposited such as in this  case It ibeing  either pure<br>
selenium or selenium doped  suitably with' chlorine and arsenic.<br>
The pressure in the chamber being ≥ 10-5  Torr.  Prior to deposition<br>
of the material the substrate was heated i'n vacuum to a temperature<br>
in the range 110 C to 120°C and  then cooled down in vacuum to a<br>
temperature in the range 55°C to 60°C.  The  TS during deposition<br>
was  maintained between 57°C to 72° C.   The  thickness of the film deposited was  between 170 µm to 200 µm.<br>
Accordingly,  the present invention provides a photoreceptor<br>
nade by the improved process of the present invention.<br>
The general  scope  and  the nature I of  the  invention  is<br>
illustrated  by the  following examples  which should  not  be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Xeroradiography photoreceptor  was prepared by  evaporating<br>
pure\doped selenium onto an alurainiura substrate of size 23.5 en x<br>
36.5 cm.  The substrate was heated in vacuiia ≥ 10-5  Torr,prior<br>
to deposition,to a temperature of 114 C and then cooled down in<br>
vacuum to a temperature of 57 C.  The substrate temperature was<br>
naintained between 57 C and 70 C during the deposition process.<br>
The thickness of the deposited film was of a conventional xerora-<br>
diography layer, i.e., about 180µm ,<br>
EXAHPLE 2<br>
Xeroradiography  photoreceptor was prepared  by  evaporating<br>
pure/doped selenium onto an aluminium substrate of size 23.5 ere x<br>
36.5 cm.   The substrate was heated in vacuum ≥10-5   Torr,prior<br>
to deposition, to a temperature of 117 C and! then cooled dowlimr<br>
vacuum to a temperature of 59°C.  The substrate temperature was<br>
maintained between 59°G to 71° C during the! deposition process. The thickness of the deposited film was  of a conventional<br>
Xeroradiography layer ,i.e., about  185  µm.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Xeroradiography photoreceptor was prepared  by  evaporating<br>
pure/doped selenium onto an aluminium substrate of size 23.5 cm X<br>
36.3 cm.   The substrate was heated in vacuum ≥ 10-5  Torr, prior to<br>
deposition,to a temperature of 120 C and then cooled down in vacuum<br>
to a temperature of 60°C.  The substrate temperature was maintained<br>
between 60 C to 72 C during the deposition process.   The thickness<br>
of  the  deposited  film was of  a  conventional  Xeroradiography<br>
layer,i.e., about 190  µm.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Xeroradiography photoreceptor was prepared  by  evaporating<br>
pure/doped selenium onto an aluminum substrate of size 23.5 cm x<br>
1-5 36.5 cm.  The substrate was heated in vacuum ≥ 10-5  Torr,prior  to<br>
deposition,  to  a temperature of 120 C and then cooled down  in<br>
vacuum to a temperature of 58°C.  The substrate temperature was<br>
maintained between 58 C to 72 C during the (deposition process.<br>
The  thickness  of  the deposited film was  of  a conventional Xeroradiography layer,i.e., about 195 µm.<br>
EXAMPLE 5 Xeroradiography photoreceptor was prepared  by  evaporating<br>
pure/doped selenium onto an aluminium substrate of size 23.5 cm x<br>
'  1    -5 36.5 cm.  The substrate was heated in vacuum ≥ 10-5  Torr,prior to<br>
deposition, to a temperature of 111 C and th«n cooled-down-in vacuum<br><br>
to a temperature of 55 C,  The substrate temperature was maintained<br>
between 57*C to 71 C during the deposition process.  The  thickness of  the  deposited  film was of  a  conventional  xeroradiography layer,i.e., about  175 µm.<br>
The  inference  drawn  from the above examples is  that  the<br>
heating  of  the  substrate in vacuum,prior  to  deposition,to  a<br>
temperature  between in the range 100 C to 130 C and then cooling<br>
it in vacuum to a lower temperature of about 50 C to 65 C,  is an<br>
inventive step in the preparation of xerorladiography photoreceptors using  the  vacuum deposition technique.<br>
The advantages  of  the improved  process  of  the present<br>
invention are:	<br>
1.	The photoreceptors made by the process have less  possibility<br>
of getting high crystalline contents in the deposited films.<br>
2.	The photoreceptors made by the process are prone  to  less<br>
defects/artifacts in the deposited films generally introduced  by<br>
the solvent traces,etc.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
