FIELD OF INVENTION :<br>
This invention relates to bloceramic composites and to a process for the preparation thereof for biomedical and other application.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION :<br>
Today  surgical interventions are possible in cases  of<br>
highly degenerative situations, tumors or minute fractures,  wi th<br>
an  aim  of replacing skeletal parts. Such substitutions  can  be<br>
effected with different materials and each material is  preferred<br>
in  certain applications. A number of materials have  been  tried<br>
but  only few met with certain degree of success, mainly  because<br>
the degree of adhesion of the prosthetic material to bone.<br>
In  order to regenerate the funct ionality  of  impaired<br>
^keletal tissue, di fferent approaches have been tried. Apart from<br>
the  autograft  and allograft materia Is, some  of  the  following<br>
i terns like coral, dimineralised bone, alumina, calcium  phosphate<br>
ceramics,  bioactive  glasses etc have been  used  for  different<br>
surg ical purposes. Among these materials, calc ium phosphate based<br>
ceramics and SiO -CaO-P O glasses form a direct bond to the  bone<br>
without  fibrous  tissue  in between. This is by  virtue  of  the<br>
formation  of  Carbonated hydroxyapatite (HCA  layer  over  these<br>
c 1 ass   of   compounds  from  the  natura1   t i ssue   env i ronment<br>
Hydroxyapati te <ca hap is an important bioceramic></ca>
10   4 6    2 presently   used  for  skeletal  repair  applications  which   is<br>
generated  from  natural or synthet ic routes.  This  compound  is<br>
similar, with respect to chemical and physical properties, to the<br>
bone  mineral  except the fact that natural bone  may  always  be<br>
2-  2+ -<br>
subst i tuted wi th addi tional ions such as CO , hg ,F etc .Because of<br>
this si mi 1 ari ty, implants of calcium hydroxyapat i t e is  most often<br>
used  clinically in the form of powders,granules and blocks.  The disadvantage  of  dense hydroxyapati te materials is   that   they take longer time to get replaced by natural bone when implanted at bony si tes duf? to si ow d issolu t ion rate of  sintered matrix-<br><br>
Another class of compounds, namely bioactive glasses, known in the art possess excellent bone bonding and bioresorbable characteristics. They are compounds containing mainly CaO, SiO2 and P2O5. A number of formulations have been identified in this family with or without additives such as Na20, MgO, NaF etc. which show direct bonding with host bone through Si-on groups. The function of silica is also to provide a low solubility molecular matrix whose network of silica chains act as a container for other ions such as Na, P, Ca etc. These ions dissolve into the surrounding body fluid, thereby activating the biochemical environment ledading to the formation of HAC.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION :<br>
A primary object of this invention is to propose a new composite bioceramic material containing calcium silicate and calcium phosphates and a process for the preparation thereof.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a new composite bioceramic material containing calcium silicate and calcium phosphates and a process for the preparation thereof and wherein the system contains lesser amount of silica than conventional bioactive glasses available in market and has better bone inducting capacity than pure hdroxy apatite bioceramic.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to prepose a new composite bioceramic material containing calcium silicate and calcium phosphates and a process for the preparation thereof which has better biocompatibility and bone growth.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a new composite bioceramic material containing calcium silicate and calcium phosphates and a process for the preparation thereof which can be used for repairing, filling or augmentation of bone defects.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION ;<br>
According to this  invention there  is  provided a process for the manufacture of dense or porous sintered bioceramic composites comprising a mixture of SiO2-CaO-P2O5 glass and calcium phosphates and present in ratios ranging from 10:90 to 90:10 veight percentages.<br>
Bioactive glasses are normally synthesized by usual melting and annealing route. In the present invention SiO2-CaO-P2O5 glass was synthesized by a sol-gel method. The fine powder generated by that method is mixed with a free flowing freeze dried calcium phosphate powder/ with or without a pre former, and compacted. The pore former is introduced to create interconnected porosity in the matrix which will help in bone ingrowth into the material. these green compacts are sintered at high temperature to sintered blocks. The blocks are porous and wisere made into various shapes by grinding or by crushing technique.<br>
EXAMPLE No. 1 ;<br>
a.	Preparation of glass powder :  A solution of Calcium<br>
nitrate (15 gm) and Phosphorous pentoxide (1.3 gm) in 10 ml of water was added to 10 ml of tetra ethoxy silane solution. This ' sol' was then allowed to gel at room temperature for 24 hours. The resultant gel was heat treated at 150 degree and made into a powder using a ball mill.<br>
b.	Preparation of calcium phosphate powder : Calcium<br>
phosphate powder was prepared by precipitation method-<br>
Ammonium phosphate (IM, pH 11) solution was added to an<br>
ammoniated calcium nitrate (IM) solution. The Ca/P<br>
ratio was maintained at 1.67. The precipitate was then<br>
aged for a day and filtered, washed and freeze dried to<br>
generate free lowing HAP powder.<br>
c.	Preparation of composite bioceramic : Above powders were<br>
mixed in 50:50 weight ratio in a ball milled for one<br>
hour. The powder mix was then compacted in a uniaxial<br>
press  into  circular  or  rectangular  blocks.   These<br>
samples were then  fired  at  1300-1350  degree  C  to  get<br><br>
composite ceramic shapes. The sintered blocks were later crushed and sieved to granules of various size ranges.<br>
EXAMPLE No, 2 ;<br>
a.	Bioactive glass powder and calcium phosphate powders<br>
were prepared as per Experiment la and lb respectively.<br>
b.	Preparation of porous composite bioceramic : Above<br>
powders were mixed in 50:50 weight ratio and ball milled<br>
for one hour along with 50 vol% naphthanein (100-400<br>
micron size powders) was added and milled for another<br>
hour. The powder mix was then compacted in a uniaxial<br>
press into circular or rectangular blocks. These<br>
samples were then fired at 1300-1350 degree C to get<br>
porous composite ceramic shapes. The sintered blocks<br>
were later crushed and sieved to granules of various<br>
size ranges.<br>
c.	The granular samples prepared by Example Nos. 1 and 2<br>
were tested for biocompatibility studies such as<br>
cytotoxicity, subcutaneous implantation and bone<br>
implantation. It was found that the samples are<br>
biocompatible, non cytotoxic and showed good bone growth<br>
in and around the sample when implanted in bony sites.<br>
They also showed growth of natural bone around the<br>
implant within 3 months.<br><br><br><br>
