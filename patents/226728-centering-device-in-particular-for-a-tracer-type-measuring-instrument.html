				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a centering device, in particular for a tracer-type<br>
measuring instrument.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
For example, the German laid-open publications DE-A-4100 323, DE-A-<br>
195 02 840 and DE-A-100 14 630 disclose multicoordinate tracer-type measuring<br>
instruments, the tracing arm of which is displaceable in the direction of a main<br>
coordinate axis defined by guides of a housing and can be deflected transversely<br>
to this main coordinate axis by means of a universal joint. The housing is held on<br>
a carrying shank, the shank axis of which runs coaxially to the main coordinate<br>
axis in the state of use. So that the main coordinate axis of the housing can be<br>
centered in relation to the shank axis, the housing is provided, facing the<br>
carrying shank, with an axially perpendicular guide surface for the carrying shank<br>
and engages with a pin into a clearance of the carrying shank, said clearance<br>
allowing radial play between the carrying shank and the pin. The housing is<br>
consequently moveable axially parallel to the carrying shank and can be centered<br>
with the aid of a plurality of setscrews held on the carrying shank and capable of<br>
being advanced toward the pin. For fixing, an axial tension screw is provided,<br>
which screws the carrying shank to the housing. However, such a centering<br>
device formed by the carrying shank of the housing necessitates a comparatively<br><br>
high outlay in production terms, particularly because of the guide surfaces and<br>
locking means used there.<br>
OBJECT OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a centering device which is suitable, in<br>
particular, for a tracer-type measuring instrument and which can be produced<br>
more simply than hitherto.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The invention proceeds from a centering device, in particular for a tracer-type<br>
measuring instrument, which comprises:<br>
An instrument carrier defining an instrument axis,<br>
A carrying shank defining a shank axis,<br>
A centering holder holding the instrument carrier, with the instrument axis<br>
parallel to the shank axis, moveably radially in relation to the latter, but so as to<br>
be capable of being fixed to the carrying shank,<br>
and is characterized in that the centering holder is designed as a parallelogram<br>
guide with a parallelogram-link region distributed about the shank axis and the<br>
instrument axis and extending along these axes.<br><br>
Such a centering holder manages without axially perpendicular guide surfaces<br>
and can therefore be produced substantially more simply and therefore more<br>
cost-effectively than in the case of conventional centering devices. Even though<br>
the centering device according to the invention is preferably used in a tracer-type<br>
measuring instrument, such as are described, for example, in the German laid-<br>
open publications DE-A-41 00 323, DE-A-195 02 840 or DE-A-100 14 630, such a<br>
centering device can also be employed advantageously in other fields of use. For<br>
example, the centering device may be an integral part of a tool holder which<br>
holds a rotary tool, such as, for example, a drill, milling cutter or the like,<br>
centrically to the axis of rotation of the spindle of a machine tool. This applies<br>
particularly to those tool holders which hold the rotary tool in a manner in which<br>
the latter is shrunk into a sleeve portion thermally expandable, for example, by<br>
means of inductive heating. Such tool holders have, for connection to the<br>
machine tool spindle, a standard coupling, for example in the form of a steep-<br>
angle taper or the like. In this case, the centering device according to the<br>
invention is arranged in the force transmission path between the standard<br>
coupling of the tool holder and the sleeve portion holding the rotary tool. In such<br>
a case, the carrying shank of the centering device according to the invention is<br>
designed as a standard coupling and the instrument carrier as a sleeve portion.<br>
The parallelogram-link regions may be a multiplicity of links, for example in the<br>
form of bars, which are separate from one another and are arranged about the<br>
carrying or instrument axis and which can be deflected on all sides, especially<br><br>
when these parallelogram-link regions are arranged in the manner of a<br>
segmented axially parallel circular-cylindrical sleeve portion. However, an<br>
embodiment in which the sleeve portion is designed with a closed wall in the<br>
circumferential direction can be adjusted more accurately and can also be<br>
produced more simply.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the centering holder has a connecting flange which<br>
surrounds the shank axis and the instrument axis and connects the carrying<br>
shank to the instrument carrier and which has on its sides facing axially away<br>
from one another circular grooves which are concentric to one another, overlap<br>
one another axially and delimit the sleeve portion radially between them. Such<br>
grooves can easily be worked into the connecting flange and, by their axial depth<br>
and the radial distance between them, determine the radial deflection properties<br>
of the sleeve portion. The annular regions of the connecting flange which project<br>
radially inward and radially outward beyond the grooves also stiffen the<br>
centering holder, so that the parallelogram movement is essentially based solely<br>
on the deformation of the sleeve portion. Both in embodiments in which the<br>
parallelogram-link regions are formed from individual bars and in embodiments<br>
with parallelogram-link regions designed as a closed sleeve portion, there is<br>
preferably provision for the at least one parallelogram-link region to be<br>
connected at its one axial end to a first annular portion of the centering holder<br>
and at its other axial end to a second annular portion of the centering holder,<br>
and for one of these annular portions to carry at least one, but preferably at<br><br>
least three, setscrews which are distributed in the circumferential direction and<br>
are supported radially in the region of the other of these annular portions. The<br>
common portions stiffen the axial ends of the parallelogram-link regions in<br>
relation to one another, the setscrews which are supported between the two<br>
annular portions ensuring a uniform deflection of the link region. Expediently, the<br>
two annular portions are arranged coaxially one in the other, the outer annular<br>
portion carrying the setscrews in a radially screwable manner. This makes it<br>
easier to adjust the setscrews.<br>
The centering holder may be a component which is separate from the carrying<br>
shank and from the housing. In a preferred variant which simplifies production,<br>
however, the parallelogram-link region is produced with its axial ends integrally<br>
in one piece with a carrying shank and/or with the instrument carrier.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained in more detail below<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1: shows an axial longitudinal section through a tracer-type measuring<br>
instrument with a centering holder according to the invention, and<br>
Figure 2: shows an axial view of the centering holder.<br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF<br>
INVENTION<br>
The tracer-type measuring instrument, designated in general by 1 in figure 1,<br>
comprises a housing 3, on which a tracing lever, designated in general by 5, is<br>
guided displaceably in the direction of a measuring axis 7 defined by the housing<br>
3. Furthermore, the tracing lever 5 is guided on the housing 3, pivotably on all<br>
sides about a pivot point 11 lying on the measuring axis 7, by means of a<br>
universal joint, here in the form of a ball joint 9, and is prestressed resiliency by<br>
a restoring spring 13 into the position of rest illustrated in the drawing, in a way<br>
which is also explained in more detail below. The tracing lever 5 has a tracing<br>
arm 15 which projects out of the housing and of which the free tracing end 17<br>
formed by a ball defines a tracing reference point 19 lying on the measuring axis<br>
7 in the position of rest of the tracing lever 5. In relation to the pivot point 11, a<br>
coupling arm 21 of the tracing lever 5 projects, opposite to the tracing arm 15,<br>
into a circular-cylindrical guide orifice 23 of the housing 3, said guide orifice<br>
being centric to the measuring axis 7. An essentially sleeve-shaped coupling<br>
piece 25 is guided in the guide orifice 23 displaceably in the direction of the<br>
measuring axis 7 by means of a guide sleeve 27, for example a spherical guide<br>
bush of the type explained in DE-A-100 14 630. A digital path-measuring device<br>
29 held on the housing 3 detects the position of the coupling piece 25 in relation<br><br>
to the housing 3 by means of a digital path sensor 31 and indicates on a display<br>
33 the value of the deflection in relation to the position of rest, illustrated in<br>
figure 1, of the tracing lever 5. A mechanical length-measuring dial gauge may<br>
also be provided instead of the digital path-measuring device 29.<br>
The coupling piece 25 has, in the region of its end axially remote from the pivot<br>
point 11, an inner control surface 35 in the form of a frustoconicai surface with a<br>
rectilinear generatrix, with which it bears against a convex outer control surface<br>
37, formed at the free end of the coupling arm 21, of the tracing lever 5. The<br>
inner control surface 35 is rotationally symmetrical to the measuring axis 7, while<br>
the outer control surface 37 is rotationally symmetrical to the straight line<br>
through the tracing reference point 19 and the pivot point 11, said straight line<br>
coinciding with the measuring axis 7 in the position of rest of the tracing lever 5.<br>
The outer control surface 37 has a generatrix in the form of a segment of a<br>
circle. The restoring spring 13 prestresses the coupling piece 25 in the direction<br>
of the tracing end 17 and at the same time ensures a bearing contact pressure of<br>
the control surfaces 35, 37 bearing against one another.<br>
During operation, the tracer-type measuring instrument 1 is held in a machine<br>
tool or a measuring instrument or the like by means of a standard coupling, for<br>
example a steep-angle taper shank, indicated at 39, which is coaxial to the<br>
measuring axis 7. During an adjusting movement of the tracing end 17 in the<br>
direction of the measuring axis 7 which occurs during measuring operation, the<br><br>
coupling arm 21 drives the coupling piece 25 which, in turn, adjusts the<br>
path-measuring device 29. During an adjusting movement of the tracing end 17<br>
transversely to the measuring axis 7, the coupling arm 21 pivots about the pivot<br>
point 11 defined by the ball joint 9. The control surfaces 35, 37, which slide on<br>
one another along their generatrices during this pivoting movement of the<br>
coupling arm 21, convert the pivoting movement of the tracing lever 5 to an axial<br>
movement of the sleeve-shaped coupling piece 25, in such a way that the path-<br>
measuring device 29 measures the radial distance between the tracing reference<br>
point 19 and the measuring axis 7. For further details of a tracer-type measuring<br>
instrument of this type, reference is made to DE-A-100 14 630.<br>
The tracer-type measuring instrument 1 is provided with a carrying shank 41, by<br>
means of which it can be clamped into the standard coupling 39 or into another<br>
tool holder of the machine tool. For exact measurements, it is necessary that the<br>
measuring axis 7 defined by the housing 3 or the tracing lever 5 runs coaxially to<br>
a centric shank axis 43 defined by the carrying shank 41. So that radial errors of<br>
alignment can be compensated, the housing 3 is held on the carrying shank 41<br>
via a centering holder 45. The centering holder 45 allows axially parallel<br>
adjustment of the measuring axis 7 in relation to the shank axis 43. For this<br>
purpose, the centering holder 45 comprises a radially projecting connecting<br>
flange 47 which is integrally formed in one piece on the carrying shank 41 and<br>
which is screwed to an axially perpendicular fitting surface 49 with the aid of a<br>
plurality of axial screws 51. The connecting flange 47 forms, toward tracing end<br><br>
17, a centering extension 53, by means of which said connecting flange is guided<br>
with a close radial fit in the guide orifice 23.<br>
On sides located axially opposite one another, the connecting flange 47 is<br>
provided with annular grooves 55, 57 which are concentric to the shank axis 43<br>
and which overlap one another in the axial direction and between them delimit a<br>
circular-cylindrical axially parallel straight sleeve portion 59. An annular portion<br>
61 formed by the bottom of the radially inner annular groove 55 connects that<br>
axial end of the sleeve portion 59 which faces away from the tracing end 17 to<br>
the carrying shank 41, while the axially other end of the sleeve portion 59 is<br>
connected, by means of an annular portion formed by the bottom 63 of the outer<br>
annular groove 57, to the circumferential region 65 of the connecting flange 47,<br>
said circumferential region being screwed to the housing 3.<br>
In at least three, here four, radial threaded holes 67 arranged distributed in the<br>
circumferential direction, are seated setscrews 69 which are accessible radially<br>
from outside and which are supported with their inner ends, near the end facing<br>
axially away from the tracing end 17, on the sleeve portion 59 and consequently,<br>
in the region of the annular portion 61, on the latter.<br>
The sleeve portion 59 forms a parallelogram guide which can be deflected on all<br>
sides transversely to the shank axis 43 and in which the sleeve portion 59<br>
subjected to flexurally elastic stress forms a parallelogram link deflectable on all<br><br>
sides. By the setscrews 69 being adjusted, the carrying shank 41 is displaced<br>
parallel to the measuring axis 7, the setscrews 69 at the same time assuming the<br>
function of operational fixing. Since four setscrews 69 offset to one another in<br>
each case at 90° are provided, the setscrews can be locked in pairs.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated, the parallelogram guide is<br>
implemented by an annularly closed sleeve extension. Instead of the annularly<br>
closed sleeve extension, a sleeve extension segmented in the circumferential<br>
direction may also be provided, or else the sleeve extension is formed by a cage<br>
comprising axially running bars. In a further variant, the connecting flange 47<br>
may not only be connected in one piece to the carrying shank 41, but also to the<br>
housing 3. In particular, the last-mentioned variant is suitable for other<br>
applications of the centering holder 45, for example for applications in which the<br>
component corresponding to the housing 3 forms a sleeve portion for the shrink-<br>
fit holding of a tool shank of a rotary tool, as is customary in the case of<br>
toolholders which, for example, are thermally expandable inductively. The<br>
carrying shank may then be designed directly as a standard coupling similar to<br>
the standard coupling 39.<br><br>
