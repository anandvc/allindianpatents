				<td>COMBINATION CONSTRUCTION OF MAGNETRON FOR MICROWAVE OVEN<br>
BACKGROUND OP THE INVENTION.<br>
The present invention relates to a magnetron for a microwave oven, and more particularly, to a improved combination construction of a magnetron for a microwave oven designed not to deform or change the position of the antenna feeder when assemblying the antenna feeder and the exhaust pipe playing a transmitting role to radiate high-frequency energy to outside.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1. the construction of the conventional magnetron was as follows:<br>
A serial filament 1 is installed axially along the internal center, and a cylindric anode 2 is also established around the filament, thus forming a diode vacuum tube.<br>
Permanent magnets 4a, 4b and magnetic pole 20, applying magnetic flux and thereby generating magnetic field to a space of action 10 located between the filament 1 and the anode 2 are formed orderly on the surface, reverse side and the center of a lower plate 3 to form a magnetic circuit.<br>
An antenna ceramic 6 and an antenna cap 7, all transmitting high-frequency energy sent by the anode 2 to outside(cavity) are established at an upper plate if fixed with the tower plate 3,<br>
A plurality of vane 8 are fixed radially inside the anode 2.<br>
A plurality of laminated radiator pins 9 are established between the lower plate 3 and the vane 8 to swiftly radiate to outside the heat created by the collision of thermoelectron at the vane 8.<br>
A filter box 11, a choke coil 12 and a condenser 13, all preventing the backward flowing of nonessential high harmonic element which is multiplied integral number than the fundamental wave of 2.450KHz being generated from the space of action 10. are established at the bottom of the lower plate 3.<br>
The filament 1, radiating the thermoelectron, is sustained by a upper-end shield 14 and a lower-end shield 15. At the lower-end shield 15, both center lead 16 and side lead(not shown) are fixed barely inside the filter box 11, and the part of the exposure inside the filter box is fixed at the terminal 17. The center lead 16 and the side lead are insulated by a cylindric cathode ceramic 18. The conventional magnetron operates as follows-<br>
When the magnetic field of the permanent magnets 4a and 4b forms a magnetic circuit at the upper and lower plates 19 and 3 and the magnetic pole 20, an electric field is formed between the vane 8 and the filament 1. As a result, the thermoelectron radiated from the filament starts a cycloid motion by the electric and magnetic fields in the space of action.<br>
Accordingly, the thermoelectron, initiating an acceleration motion is converted into high-frequency energy, also known as electron energy. At this time, most of the high-frequency energy transmit not only the fundamental wave of 2,450KHz, but also<br>
the high harmonics which are multiplied integral number than the fundamental wave. The high harmonic, however, are eliminated by the choke 22 established inside the anode seal 21.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, for the purpose of placing the center of the antenna feeder 5 on the center of the anode 21 to be assembled in the exhaust pipe 23, the conventional art formed the exhaust pipe 23 in a cylindric shape, and formed a sustaining part 5a of a flat shape at the inserting end of the antenna feeder 5 slightly smaller than the inside diameter of the exhaust pipe, thus placing the antenna feeder 5 on the center of the anode seal 21 when connecting the sustaining part 5a to the exhaust pipe 23.<br>
However, since the conventional sustaining part 5a was bigger than the body of the antenna feeder 5, there was a problem deforming the sustaining part 5a because of its hitting at the lower part of the exhaust pipe 23 when inserting the antenna feeder 5 into the anode seal 21. Therefore, the conventional art demanded so much caution during die assembly work while reducing the efficiency of work.<br>
In addition to the above, upon completion of the assembly of the antenna feeder 5, a wide space S was also seen between the outside diameter (01) of the body of the antenna feeder and the inside diameter (03) of the exhaust pipe. Because of this reason, when cutting off the exhaust pipe by the tip off work of the vacuum sealing work, the antenna feeder was deformed by pressing down or pulling up, thus it had greatly affected on the coupling degree of the magnetron output section. A.S a result,<br>
the characteristics of the output, noise and stability of the magnetron were damaged.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the object of the present invention is to provide a improved combination construction of magnetron with its capability to swiftty assemble an antenna feeder with an exhaust pipe without being deformed, and, at the same time, to keep the exhaust pipe and the antenna feeder from being deformed or changed of the position of the antenna feeder during the tip off/owrk, thus safely maintain the characteristics of the output part, noise and stability of the magnetron.<br>
According to the present invention, an improved combination construction of a magnetron for a microwave oven designed to fix one side of an antenna feeder on a vane, and to assemble the body of the antenna feeder on the exhaust pipe by placing it on the center of the anode seal to perform the tip off work on its top comprises the following parts: (a) an antenna feeder having a stick shaped body, (b) an exhaust pipe, where the antenna feeder is inserted therein to perform the tip off work, comprising a small diameter part which has an inside diameter bigger than the outside diameter of the antenna feeder; a large diameter part which has an inside diameter bigger than a small diameter part and is inserted with the antenna feeder; and a connection part connecting the small and large diameter parts, and its inside diameter is gradually narrowed as it extends toward the small diameter part from the large diameter part. The body part of the antenna feeder to be inserted into the<br>
conventional magnetron is omitted while assigning the same symbols.<br>
As indicated in the drawing, the body part of the antenna feeder 5 with one side of its lower part is fixed on the vane 8 is formed in a stick shape, and its end is sharp-pointed.<br>
In other words, the inside diameter of the small diameter part 23a of the exhaust pipe 23 being inserted in the body pan of the antenna feeder 5 and be tipped off is formed slightly bigger than the outside diameter of the antenna feeder 5. The large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe is formed to be bigger than the small diameter part 23a. The connection part 23c, linking the large diameter part 23b and the small diameter part 23a, forms a slope 23d with its outside diameter also reduces gradually. When assembling the antenna feeder 5 into the exhaust pipe 23, the antenna feeder 5 is inserted into the small diameter part 23a through the large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe 23.<br>
This is so designed to lead the upper end of the antenna feeder 5 to the slope 23d of the connection part 23c when assemblyng the antenna feeder 5 into the exhaust pipe 23 without deforming the end of the antenna feeder, and to lead the end of the antenna feeder more smoothly into the small diameter part 23c.<br>
The ratio of the outside diameter (01) of the antenna feeder 5 and the inside diameter (02) of the small diameter part is set at 01=0.802 - 0.902. The setting of the above causes no trouble during the assemblying of the antenna feeder 5 with the small diameter part 23a of the exhaust pipe 23. When completed the assembly work,<br>
conventional magnetron is omitted while assigning the same symbols.<br>
As indicated in the drawing, the body part of the antenna feeder 5 with one side of its lower part is fixed on the vane 8 is formed in a stick shape, and its end is sharp-pointed.<br>
In other words, the inside diameter of the small diameter part 23a of the exhaust pipe 23 being inserted in the body part of the antenna feeder 5 and be tipped off is formed slightly bigger than the outside diameter of the antenna feeder 5. The large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe is formed to be bigger than the small diameter part 23a. The connection part 23c, linking the large diameter part 23b and the small diameter part 23a, forms a slope 23d with its outside diameter also reduces gradually. When assemblying the antenna feeder 5 into the exhaust pipe 23, the antenna feeder 5 is inserted into the small diameter part 23a through the large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe 23.<br>
This is so designed to lead the upper end of the antenna feeder 5 to the slope 23d of the connection part 23c when assemblyng the antenna feeder 5 into the exhaust pipe 23 without deforming the end of the antenna feeder, and to lead the end of the antenna feeder more smoothly into the small diameter part 23c.<br>
The ratio of the outside diameter (01) of the antenna feeder 5 and the inside diameter (02) of the small diameter part is set at 01=0.802 - 0.902. The setting o/ the above causes no trouble during the assemblying of the antenna feeder 5 with the small diameter part 23a of the exhaust pipe 23. When completed the assembly work,<br>
the gap between them is minimized so that pressing or pulling up of the antenna feeder during the tip off work can be prevented<br>
The operational motion and effect of the present invention are as ollows: Tn order to place the antenna feeder 5 on the center of the anode seal 21, one side of the antenna feeder 5 is fixed on a vane 8 through a hole formed at the magnetic pole 20. When the upper end of the antenna feeder 5 is pushed in through the large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe 23, the upper end of the antenna feeder forms a sharp-pointed slope within the range of 50-70 degrees. Therefore, the contact area of the upper end with the large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe is minimized, and the antenna feeder can more easily be inserted into the exhaust pipe 23 through the large diameter part 23b.<br>
When the upper end of the antenna feeder 5 is inserted into the large diameter part 23b of the exhaust pipe 23, the sharp-pointed upper end of the antenna feeder 5 is led to the slope 23d formed inside the connection part 23c of the exhaust pipe 23 and is further inserted into the inside of the small diameter part 23a without difficulty as shown in FIG. 4.<br>
When the antenna feeder 5 is inserted into the exhaust pipe 23 as described above, the ratio of the outside diameter (01) of the antenna feeder 5 and the inside diameter (02) of the small diameter part should be 01=0.802 - 0.902. Thus, the antenna feeder 5 is not deformed by pressing or pulling during the tip off work for the vacuum sealing of the magnetron.<br>
In addition, when the cutting point of the antenna feeder 5 is matched to the point where the connection part 23c of the exhaust pipe 23 and the small diameter part 23a arc met, the deviation of the lip off point can also be reduced.<br><br><br><br><br>
