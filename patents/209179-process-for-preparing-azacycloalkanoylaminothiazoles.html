COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"PROCESS FOR PREPARING AZACYCLOALKANOYLAMINOTHIAZOLES"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of Lawrenceville-Princeton Rd., P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
23-7-2006<br><br>
1 <br>
The present invention concerns new processes for the preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazoles and analogs, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.<br>
The 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazole compounds of formula I<br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:<br>
R is alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl;<br>
R6 and R7 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, halogen,<br>
hydroxy or alkoxy; R8 is hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, CONR9V10, COR11 or COOR12; R9, R10, R11 and R12 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl or aryl; m equals 0 to 5; and n equals 0 to 5,<br>
are novel, potent inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (cdks).  They are useful in the therapy of proliferative diseases, for example, cancer, inflammation, autoimmune<br>
2<br><br>
LD137ePCT<br>
diseases such as arthritis, viral diseases, fungal diseases, chemotherapy-induced alopecia,<br>
neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease.<br>
More specifically, the compounds of formula I are useful in the treatment of a variety of<br>
cancers such as bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver and lung cancers.<br>
5	WO 9924416  and corresponding U.S.  Patent No.  6,040,321   describe the<br>
preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles, key intermediates in the synthesis of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazoles of formula I, by reacting 5-acetylthio-2-acetylaminothiazole with a base followed by trapping the thiolate with a 2-oxazolylalkyl halide.   Hydrolysis of the resulting 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-<br>
10 acetylaminothiazole compounds afforded the 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazole key intermediates. The requisite 2-oxazolylalkyl halides were prepared by (i) reaction of p-hydroxy amines with -chloroacyl chlorides followed by oxidation of the resulting p-hydroxy-a-chloroamides and subsequent oxazole ring formation (K. S. Kim et al, WO 9924416, May 20, 1999) or (ii) reaction of a-diazo ketones with -chloronitriles (K.S.<br>
15 Kim et al, WO 9924416, May 20, 1999; T. Ibata et al, Bull Chem. Soc. Japan 1979, 52, 3597). Although a variety of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles can be prepared by this method, this process is not amenable to large scale synthesis due to the commercial availability of the starting 5-acetylthio-2-acetylaminothiazole, the use of hazardous a-diazo ketones and expensive chromatographic separation of products.<br>
20	Reaction of a-halo ketones with azide to give a-azido ketones has been<br>
previously reported in the literature (A. Hassner et al, Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl 1986, 25,478; M. G. Nair et al, J. Med. Chem. 1980, 23, 899; H.-J. Ha et al, Synth. Commun. 1994, 24, 2557). Reaction of a-sulfonyloxy ketones with azide to give a-azido ketones<br>
3<br><br>
LD137ePCT<br>
las also been previously reported (T. Patonay et al, J. Org. Chem. 1994, 59, 2902; G. A. Revelli et al, Synth. Commun. 1993,23,1111).<br>
Reduction of -azido ketones to a-amino ketones has been described in the literature (H.-J. Ha et al, Synth. Commun. 1994, 24, 2557; J. P. Sanchez et al, J. 5 Heterocycl Chem. 1988, 25, 469; S. K. Boyer et al, J. Org. Chem. 1985, 50, 3408). Reaction of a-amino ketones with a-halo acyl halides to give the corresponding amides has further been described (G. T. Newbold et al, J. Chem. Soc. 1948, 1855; G. T. Newbold et al, J. Chem. Soc. 1950, 909).<br>
Reaction of alkylthiouronium salts with alkyl halides to give sulfides has been 10 previously reported (H. Chen et al, Synth. Commun. 1990, 20, 3313). Reaction of alkylthiols with 5-bromo-2-aminothiazole to give 5-alkylthio-2-aminothiazoles has been reported (J. B. Dickey et al, J. Org. Chem. 1959,24, 187).<br>
This invention concerns new efficient processes for the preparation of 5-(2-15 oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles. The processes involve new strategies for the preparation of 2-oxazolylalkyl halides and 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles which include the method of making new key intermediate quaternary ammonium salts and 2-oxazolylalkyl sulfide derivatives. This invention further relates to processes for the preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazoles and 20     analogs, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.<br>
The present invention relates to new, more efficient processes for the preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles with application to the synthesis of 5-(2-<br>
4<br><br>
LD137ePCT<br>
oxazolylalkylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazoles and analogs, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases. The process generally involves reaction of a-halo ketones II with an azide to give a-azido ketones III. Reduction of III with a reducing reagent gives a-amino ketones IV. From a practical standpoint, safety concerns make this reaction 5     through the azide economically unfeasible.<br>
Alternatively and more advantageously, the a-amino ketones IV are prepared by reaction of a-halo ketones II with a cyclic alkylenetetramine such as hexamethylenetetramine and the like, followed by hydrolysis of the resulting, new quaternary ammonium salt III'.   This reaction provides excellent yields of the desired<br>
10     intermediate compound IV, above 90%, yet in a safer manner.<br>
Thereafter, reacting the a-amino ketones IV with an a-halo acyl halide V in the presence of a base or, alternatively, coupling the a-amino ketones IV with an a-halo acid, produces the corresponding amides VI. Then, ring closure of VI with a dehydrating reagent affords 2-oxazolylalkyl halides VII.   When a conventional dehydrating reagent<br>
15 such as trihalophosphorus oxide like POCI3 is used, product isolation is difficult due to the formation of large amounts of hydrochloric and phosphoric acids. Thus, the process of the present invention preferably utilizes the Burgess' reagent which produces excellent yields and permits easy, safe product isolation from water.<br>
Subsequent treatment of 2-oxazolylalkyl halides VII with sulfur-containing<br>
20 reagent VIII or VIII' affords new key intermediate compounds, 2-oxazolylalkyl sulfides IX. Coupling of IX with 5-halo-2-aminothiazole X gives 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles XI. Coupling of XI with an azacycloalkanoic acid derivative XII affords thiazolyl amides XIII, which may be deprotected (in the case where P is a protecting<br>

When a functional group is termed "protected," this means that the group is in modified form to preclude undesired side reactions at the protected site. Suitable protecting groups for the compounds involved in the present processes will be recognized from the specification taking into account the level of skill in the art, and with reference<br>
15 to standard textbooks such as T. W. Greene et al., Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, Wiley, N.Y. (1991).<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts of the biologically active compounds which do not significantly or adversely affect the pharmaceutical properties of the compounds such as, for example, toxicity, efficacy, etc.<br>
20 and include those salts which are conventionally employed in the pharmaceutical industry. Suitable examples of salts include, but are not limited to, those formed with inorganic or organic acids such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, sulfate, phosphate, etc. Also included, particularly for the intermediate compounds of the invention, are salts<br>
9<br><br>
LD137ePCT<br>
which are unsuitable for pharmaceutical utility but which can be employed otherwise, for example, for isolation or purification of free active compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
All stereoisomers of the compounds of the instant invention are contemplated, either in admixture or in pure or substantially pure form. The definition of the compounds employed in the processes of the invention embraces all possible stereoisomers and their mixtures. The definition further embraces the racemic forms and the isolated optical isomers having the specified activity. The racemic forms can be resolved by physical methods such as, for example, fractional crystallization, separation or crystallization of diastereomeric derivatives or separation by chiral column chromatography. The individual optical isomers can be obtained from the racemates by conventional methods such as, for example, salt formation with an optically active acid followed by crystallization.<br>
It should be understood that solvates (e.g., hydrates) of the compounds of formula I and the intermediate compounds are also within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known in the art. Therefore, the compounds useful in the processes of this invention may be in the free or hydrate form.<br>
As set forth in Scheme 1, the processes for the preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazoles and analogs involve the following transformations:<br>
(a) reacting an a-substituted ketone II such as, for example, an a-halo ketone, with an azide in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give an a-azido ketone III; or, more desirably, (a') reacting an a-substituted ketone II like the a-halo ketone with a<br>
10<br><br><br>
LD137ePCT<br>
cyclic alkylenetetramine such as, for example, hexamethylenetetramine in a suitable  solvent or solvent mixtures to give a new quaternary ammonium salt III'.<br>
The a-halo ketone includes a-halo aliphatic and a-halo aromatic ketones. The preferred a-halo ketones are a-halo pinacolones with a-bromo pinacolone most 5 preferred. A sulfonate, for example, RSO2O- (where R is alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl), CF3SO2O- and the like, may be substituted for the halogen in the a-position. The azides include both metal azides and quaternary ammonium azides. The metal azides are preferred with sodium azide most preferred. Suitable solvent(s) include solvents such as hydrocarbons, ethers, amides, for example, dimethylformamide, ketones, etc., or mixtures<br>
10     thereof, with ketones such as acetone preferred for both reactions (a) and (a').<br>
(b) reacting the a-azido ketone III obtained in step (a) with a reducing reagent in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give an a-amino ketone IV, or, more desirably, (b1) reacting the quaternary ammonium salt III1 obtained in step (a1) with an acid in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give an a-amino ketone IV.<br>
15	The reducing reagent in reaction (b) includes hydrogen in the presence of a<br>
transition metal catalyst such as palladium, trialkyl or triarylphosphines like triphenylphosphine. Hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst is preferred with hydrogen and palladium over activated carbon most preferred. Suitable solvent(s) in reaction (b) include solvents such as hydrocarbons, ethers, alcohols and the like, or<br>
20 mixtures thereof, with alcohol such as methanol preferred. Alternatively, the reduction reaction can be carried out in the presence of an acidic medium such as, for example, hydrochloric acid in ethanol to give a-amino ketone acid salt which can be isolated as the acid salt or free amine forms.<br>
11<br><br>
LD137ePCT<br>
The acid in reaction (b') includes, but is not limited to, protic acids such as HCl,<br>
^HBr, HI, H2S04, H3PO4, etc., with HCl preferred.   Suitable solvent(s) in reaction (b)<br>

with alcohol such as ethanol preferred. The a-amino ketone product may be isolated as<br>
5     the salt or free base forms.<br>
(c) reacting (acylating) the a-amino ketone IV or its acid salt obtained in step (b) or (b') with an a-substituted acyl derivative V such as, for example, an a-halo acyl halide, in the presence of a base and in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give an amide VI.<br>
10	The a-halo acyl halide V includes a-alkyl or aryl substituted or unsubstituted a-<br>
halo acyl halide with the latter preferred. The most preferred a-halo acyl halide is a-chloroacetyl chloride. The base used in the reaction includes, but is not limited to, aromatic and aliphatic organic amines with the latter preferred. The most preferred base is triethylamine.    Suitable solvent(s) include aprotic solvents such as hydrocarbons,<br>
15 halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters and the like, or mixtures thereof, with halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane preferred. Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out using an a-substituted acid instead of the a-substituted acyl derivative and then employing a coupling reagent such as a water-soluble diimide like carbodiimide, haloformate, thionyl halide, etc.    In either reaction, a sulfonate, for<br>
20 example, RSO2O- (where R is an alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl), CF3SO2O- and the like, may be substituted for the halogen in the a-position of the a-halo acyl halide or the a-halo acid reactants which are illustrated.<br>

Advantageously, the reaction is carried out using (methoxycarbonylsulfamoyl)-5 triethylammonium hydroxide (Burgess' reagent) as the dehydrating reagent. Suitable solvent(s) include hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers and the like, or mixtures thereof. Most preferred is the use of the Burgess' reagent in tetrahydrofuran. Suitable dehydrating reagents also include, but are not limited to, other bases, acids, acid anhydrides and the like, such as, e.g., concentrated sulfuric acid, polyphosphoric acid, 10 etc. Although less conveniently, the dehydrating reagent, for instance, can be trihalophosphorus oxide such as tribromophosphorus oxide or trichlorophosphorus oxide, alone or with a solvent like toluene.<br>
(e)	reacting the 2-oxazolylalkyl derivative VII obtained in step (d) with a sulfur-<br>
containing reagent VIII or VIII' in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give 2-<br>
15     oxazolylalkyl sulfide IX, a new key intermediate compound.<br>
The sulfur-containing reagent includes N-substituted or unsubstituted thioureas, thio acids or salts such as thioacetic acid or its salt, xanthic acids or salts such as ethylxanthic acid potassium salt. Unsubstituted thiourea is preferred. Suitable solvent(s) include hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, amides, alcohols and the<br>
20     like, or mixtures thereof, with alcohol such as methanol or ethanol preferred.<br>

5	The starting compounds of Scheme 1 are commercially available or may be<br>
prepared by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
To further illustrate Scheme 1, a process to make 5-(5-t-butyI-2-oxazolylmethylthio)-2-azacycloalkanoylaminothiazoles and analogs thereof, for example, starts with reaction of a-bromo pinacolone II (R = Bu-t, R1 = H, L = Br) with sodium<br>
0	azide to give an a-azido pinacolone III (R = Bu-t, R1 = H). Reduction of a-azido<br>
pinacolone III (R = Bu-t, R = H) with a reducing reagent gives a-amino pinacolone IV<br>
(R = Bu-t, R = H). Alternatively and more desirably, the a-amino pinacolone IV (R =<br>
Bu-t, R1 = H) is prepared by reaction of a-bromo pinacolone II (R = Bu-t, R1 = H, L = Br)<br>
with  hexamethylenetetramine  followed  by  hydrolysis  of the  resulting  quaternary<br>
1	5     ammonium salt III' (R = Bu-t, R1 = H, L = Br). Coupling of a-amino pinacolone IV (R =<br>
Bu-t, R1 = H) with an a-chlor0acetyl chloride V (R2 = R3 = H, L - X = CI) produces amide VI (R = Bu-t, R1 = R2 =R3 = H, L = CI). Ring closure of VI with a dehydrating reagent affords 5-t-butyl-2-oxa% olylmethyl chloride VII (R = Bu-t, R1 = R2 =R3 = H, L = CI). Treatment of VII with sulfur-containing reagent VIII or VIII' such as thiourea 10 affords 5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylalkyl sulfide IX (R = Bu-t, R1 = R2 =R3 = H, Y = NH, Z = NH2). Coupling of IX with 5-bromo-2-aminothiazole X (R4=R5=H, L=Br) gives 5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylmethylthio)-2-aminothiazole XI (R = Bu-t, R1 = R2 =R3 = R4 = R5 = H). Coupling of XI with N-Boc aza.Cycloalkanoic acid XII (X = OH, R6 = R7 = H, m = 0, n =<br>
