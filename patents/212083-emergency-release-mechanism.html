				<td>EMERGENCY RELEASE, "' "ANISM FOR ELECTRICAL BUS DOOR Cross-Refernnr-o to Ralatad Applications<br>
The present application is related to and claims benefit from U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/289,319 filed May 2001. This application is also<br>
closely related to U.S:  "application Serial Number 	,<br>
entitled "Electric Door "perator", filed 	.<br>
ffioi -! -f th« Invention<br>
This invention r :!es generally to power operators for multi-passenger iv.ass transit vehicles, more particularly to an aency release mechanism for an electrically driven door operator for opening and closing dual leaf doors such as used in multiple passenger vehicles riing airport utility transports, school, and small trar - '• • buses.<br>
Background the Invention<br>
Prior to the f power operated door openers, doors of mass transi hides were manually opened and closed, typically by  vehicle operator. The strain of actuating these door springs and closings often led to long term medical dif I ties for the vehicle operators. The need for power . -rated door openers led to the development of larae". pneumatically actuated operators<br>
since in most large --hides, use of air brake systems provides a reliable and convenient source of operating a.ir at controlled pressure-.   U.S. Patent Numbers 4,490,941 and 4,134,231 show o.cse types of vehicles typically incorporate hydraulic br^ke systems.   Therefore, no air supply is available, anri hydraulic door drives are high in cost and involve exces , -
A power door c•.-,, --.gtor for multi-passenger mass transit vehicles in ^ii-'closed in U.S. Patent Number 5,332,279, the spe.-:i • i cation of which is hereby incorporated by reference:. This type of prior art system incorporates an electr-l O ly driven gear motor operating drive arms rotating approximately 160° in order to open and close a dual panel swing door set. A gear motor drive shaft operating through a sleeve clutch operates individually adjustable -~ngth drive arras of a drive bar in order to effect app" ~ innately 90° rotation of each door from open to closed are closed to open. The operating door shafts located at the outer edges of each panel have<br>
door arms affixed thereLO for connection to the above-mentioned reciprocating drive arms through door drive rods. Each door drive rod end is interfaced between its respective drive arm aun door arm with a spherical rod end.<br>
In order to obtain door operation independent of the door power drive,  or door, operation in the event of operator failure or in -an emergency situation, the clutch fork actuating bar 20 10, manually actuated by an actuator assembly, see Figures 4-5 of U.S. Patent Number 5,332,279 which are labeled as prior art Figures 1 and 2 of the present application.   As shown in Figure 2, the normal position of the mushroom headed plunger 34 is extended somewhat  from  the  surface  of  the  movable  panel  31 internally into the vehicle.  In the event that uncoupling of the operator and door panels is desired, it is only necessary to move the plunger end 35 toward the panel, thereby actuating the clutch fork actuating bar 20, by compressing engaging sprig 23 which allows the clutch fork assembly 16 to piv^; on pins 17, thereby moving the slide collar and drive h-ir assembly 8 inward along shaft 10 and disengaging the ;jear box drive shaft teeth 12 and aperture slots 14.  D clutch disengagement, drive rod<br>
ends 41 deflect inwardly, resulting in angular movement 43 of rods 40.<br>
With the  clutch disengaged,,  resilient  edges  and vehicle body door seal  mounted on the vehicle structure, having been compressed on closing, provide an initial door opening force.   Therefore,  on disengagement of clutch teeth 12 and slots 14, the door panels are moved ajar. The doors can then be manually moved to an open position. When  normal  door  operation  is  desired,  it  is  only necessary to actuate the door motor.  Re-engagement of the clutch teeth and apertures will again place the doors in their original relative positions for power operation.<br>
A disadvantage of some types of prior art. emergency releases which use tognle. mechanisms as clamping devices require a large amount, of travel of the clamping lever to achieve a very short stroke at the full load. A need exists for ah emergency release mechanism which produces high final force within the mechanism resulting in relatively long travel of the lever under full load and a ahort travel of its dn^inrr arm.<br>
The aforementioned related patent application, U.S.<br>
Serial Number 	 _  is directed to an electric door<br>
operator for a mass transit vehicle.   In the event of<br>
operator failure or in an emergency situation, there is a need for an emergency release mechanism which is compatible with this type of electric door operator.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The following background information is provided to assist the reader to understand, the environment in which the invention will typically be used. The terms used herein are not intended to be limited to any particular narrow interpretation unless specifically stated otherwise in this document.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 3A and. 3B, the present invention is directed to an emergency release mechanism, generally indicated, as 10, for use with a door operator, generally indicated as 12, of a multi-passenger mass transit vehicle for manually opening a door of this mass transit vehicle.<br>
The emergency release mechanism 10 comprises a toggle mechanism, generally indicated as 14, having a first fixed pivot 16 and a second fixed 18 pivot and a movable pivot 20 positioned between the. first and second fixed pivots 16, 18.  The first fixed pivot 16 is secured to a wall portion 22 of the vehicle.  A target member 24 is provided which is associated with and/or is a component of the door operator 12.  This target member 24 is capable of moving in a vertical direction to enable an emergency release of the door.  A clamping lever 26 is provided which has a first end 28 and a second end 30.  The first end 28 of the clamping lever 26 is pivotally attached to the second fixed pivot 18 of the toggle mechanism 14 and the second end 30 of the clamping lever 26 is capable of engaging the target member 24.<br>
A means, such as a. stanchion 32, is provided for mounting the clamping lever 26 such that the clamping lever 26 is capable of pivoting in a first and second direction to one of an engaging and disengaging position with respect to the target member 24. The stanchion 32 is positioned between the first end 28 and second end 30 of the clamping lever.<br>
An actuating means 34 is connected at 35 to the movable  pivot  20  of  the  toggle  mechanism  14.    The actuating means 34 can be a drive arm or any well known means- capable of pivoting the clamping lever 26.   The actuating means 34 is capable of pivoting the clamping lever 26 in one of an engaging position and disengaging position with the target member 24 for moving the target member 24 in a vertical direction  for achieving an emergency release of the door of the mass transit vehicle. The toggle mechanism 14 can include a biasing means 36 positioned between the movable pivot 20 and the second fixed pivot 18.   This biasing means 36 can comprise a spring or any other well known biasing means.<br>
A return spring 38 is engaged with a predetermined portion of the clamping lever 26 to assist in disengaging the clamping lever from the target.<br>
As shown in Figures 4-6, the emergency release mechanism can be used in combination with 'an electrically actuated rotary door 12. In this embodiment, the driving arm 34 has an end portion 40 which is attached to the wall portion 22 of the transit vehicle at a fixed pivot point 42. This fixed pivot point 42 corresponds with the first fixed pivot 16 of the toggle mechanism 14. The driving<br>
arm 34 is capable of being manually actuated by rotation thereof about this fixed pivot point 42.  As stated above, the drive arm 34 is connected at 35 to the movable pivot 20 of the toggle mechanism 14 such that movement of the drive arm 34  results  in  the movement  of the toggle .mechanism 14 about the mox/able pivot 20.  Such movement of the toggle mechanism 14 results in pivotal movement of the clamping lever 26 in one of an engaging position and disengaging position with the target member 24 for moving the target member 24 in a vertical direction for achieving an emergency release of the door of the mass transit vehicle.<br>
The target member 24 comprises a driving pinion 44 driven by a gear motor 45 within the electrically actuated rotary door operator 12. The driving pinion 44 intermeshes with a gear sector 46 to achieve opening and closing of the vehicle door. Vertical movement of the driving pinion 44 results in disengagement of this driving pinion 44 from the gear sector 46 to enable manual opening of the vehicle door.<br>
The driving arm 34 is also capable of traveling beyond a dead position or within a dead zone 48 while remaining in a released position.<br>
The emergency release mechanism of the invention is especially • convenient when target source yields high frictional drag. This high frictional drag can be produced between meshing teeth of the driving pinion 44 and the gear sector 46 during axial motion of the driving pinion 44 under full, load during de-clutching a gear motor 45 from engagement with the driven gear sector 46.<br>
The toggle mechanism 14 having a pushing linkage absorbs energy during the initial stage of its motion via deflecting by the spring 36. The stiffness of this spring 36 should be as high as demanded by the lever system serving a target member 24 and also deflecting the returning spring 38 acting in the opposite direction. The toggle mechanism also allows its driving arm to travel beyond the "dead" position in spite of the lever remaining in the released position.<br>
The mechanism of the invention produces a high final force within a lever mechanism which provides a relatively long travel of the acting lever under full load and a short travel of its driving arm. Well known toggle mechanisms which are used as clamping devices provide large travel of the clamping lever and very short stroke at the full load.<br>
The emergency release mechanism 10 of the invention produces high final force within the mechanism resulting in relatively long travel of the clamping lever 26 under full load and a short travel of its driving arm 34.<br>
The invention may be utilized in -a variety of electrical rotary door operators and safety release mechanisms. Note that the clamping lever 26 may either engage or disengage the target member 24, as shown in Figures 3A and 3B, to achieve vertical movement of this target member 24 to enable an emergency release depending upon the environment in which the emergency release mechanism is utilized.<br>
It is noted that the Figures show the emergency release mechanism in combination with a door operator for opening and closing a pair of pivotally mounted swing doors. However, one having ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the emergency release mechanism may be utilized with a door operator for use with a single plug door.<br>
The invention has been described in such full, clear, concise and exact terras so as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use the same. It should be understood that variations, modifications,<br>
equivalents and substitutions for components of the specifically described embodiments of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims. Persons who possess such skill will also recognize that the foregoing .description is merely illustrative and not intended to limit any of the ensuing claims to any particular narrow interpretation.<br><br><br><br><br>
