				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention pertains to various compounds, methods of producing the compounds, compositions containing the compounds, and methods of using the compounds and the compositions containing the compounds. Some examples are to use the compounds as Pharmaceuticals, aversive agents and/or as antifoulants.   One of the compounds is lidocaine nonivamide. This compound, as well as many of the other compounds, are utilized as antifouling agents either alone or in a composition, especially a composition comprising 10,10'-oxybisphenoxarsine (OBPA) or other organo-arsenicals or biocidal antifoulants and molluscicides.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,207,290 to Blum et al. discloses antifoulant compositions including 10, lO'-oxybisphenoxarsine and/or phenarsazine oxide with a quaternary ammmonium salt. In particular, U.S. Patent No. 6,207,290 discloses denatonium capsaicinate as one of the quaternary ammonium compounds.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,652,577 to Hollander et al. and U.S. Patent No. 4,661,504 to Hollander et al. disclose denatonium saccharide to protect an article against gnawing, biting, licking, and feeding by various animals.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,891,919 to Blum et al. discloses denatonium capsaicinate and its use as an aversive agent, biocide, antifoulant, and flavorant. Denatonium capsaicinate is formed by reaction of a denatonium compound with capsaicin. Although the patent discloses that the combination of lidocaine or a lidocaine derivative in an aqueous, glycol, polyol, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), alcohol solution or combination thereof with capsaicin or any of its derivatives will form some denatonium capsaicinate, this is incorrect. In order to form a denatonium compound from lidocaine, a benzyl group, such as benzyl chloride, must first be reacted with the lidocaine. Additionally, U.S. Patent No. 5,891,919 foils to distinguish between synthetic capsaicin and nonivamide. Although nonivamide is sometimes referred to as a synthetic capsaicin or a homologue of capsaicin, it is not capsaicin since its molecular structure and chemical and physical properties are quite different. U.S. Patent No. 5,891,919 refers to nonivamide as synthetic capsaicin even though this is not correct since nonivamide is a capsaicinoid. There are many different capsaicinoids and capsaicinates.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,465,022 to Torres discloses a method for providing an extract of capsicum, which contains a capsaicinoid and terpene.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,985,010 to Etscorn et al. and U.S. Patent No. 5,674,496 to Etscorn et al. disclose extraction of natural capsaicinoids from chile peppers. Both patents also disclose using the extract to minimize damage to objects caused by animals, especially by gnawing and<br>
chewing.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,698,191 to Wiersma et al. discloses a bio-repellent amount of capsicum oleoresin and an amount of a saponin sufficient to enhance the effectiveness of the capsicum oleoresin.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,629,045 to Veech discloses antifoulant coatings that include capsaicin and nonivamide. Veech states that capsaicin can be extracted from cayenne pepper.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,397,385 to Watts discloses an anti-fouling coating that uses capsaicin as an antifouling agent. The patent also discloses utilizing synthetic capsainoid compounds such as synthetic capsaicin (C) and synthetic dihydrocapsaicin (DHC).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention recognizes novel compounds having various characteristics, including having antifouling, analgesic, anaesthetic, mildewcidal, biocidal, pharmaceutical, aversant, repellent, flavorant, carminative, and antismoking agent properties. The invention includes the compounds themselves, the methods for their production, compositions comprising the compounds, and uses of the compounds and of the compositions. One important aspect of the invention involves the compound lidocaine nonivamide, which has many useful characteristics, including antifouling and pharmaceutical properties. Lidocaine nonivamide or a composition containing lidocaine nonivamide is very effective as an antifoulant, for example. A composition comprising lidocaine nonivamide as a co-biocide can further comprise OBPA and/or copper and/or copper oxides and/or organo-tins for excellent results as, inter alia, an antifoulant.<br>
Another composition with excellent results is a combination of nonivamide and OBPA and/or other organo-arsenicals. Both nonivamide and OBPA are known as antifoulants. However, mixing them together improves their performance synergistically. The results are significantly better than either OBPA or nonivamide separately. A composition comprising OBPA and nonivamide can have antifoulant properties that last 25% to 100% longer than either OBPA or nonivamide separately. The scope of the invention includes a composition comprising capsaicin and OBPA as an effective antifoulant. It should be noted, however, that using nonivamide instead of capsaicin provides longer protection at a much more economical price.<br>
The invention also encompasses other novel compounds with antifoulant, pharmaceutical and other useful properties as described below.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to novel compounds having various uses, including having antifouling, analgesic, anaesthetic, biocidal, aversant, repellent, pharmaceutical, flavorant, carminative, irritant, incapacitant, and antismoking properties. Some of these compounds may also have useful cardiovascular benefits such as, for example, being antithrombotic. Many of these capsaicinoid compounds and homologs that have pharmaceutical, antifouling, and other properties are related in that they contain a "caine" functionality, such as lidocaine nonivamide, etc.  For the purpose of brevity, a list of compounds will be referred to as the "caine compounds" and whenever "caine compounds" appears in this description, this will be a reference to the following compounds: lidocaine capsaicinate, benzocaine capsaicinate,<br>
bupivacaine capsaicinate, mepivacaine capsaicinate, cocaine capsaicinate, ambucaine capsaicinate, betoxycaine capsaicinate, butacaine capsaicinate, butoxycaine capsaicinate, dibucaine capsaicinate, etidocaine capsaicinate, fomocaine capsaicinate, hexylcaine capsaicinate, meprylcaine capsaicinate, myrtecaine capsaicinate, octacaine capsaicinate, orthocaine capsaicinate, piperocaine capsaicinate, prilocaine capsaicinate, procaine capsaicinate, propanocaine capsaicinate, propoxycaine capsaicinate, pseudococaine capsaicinate, pyrrocaine capsaicinate, risocaine capsaicinate, tetracaine capsaicinate, tolycaine capsaicinate, lidocaine nonivamide, benzocaine nonivamide, bupivacaine nonivamide, mepivacaine nonivamide, cocaine nonivamide, ambucaine nonivamide, betoxycaine nonivamide, butacaine nonivamide, butoxycaine nonivamide, dibucaine nonivamide, etidocaine nonivamide, fomocaine nonivamide, hexylcaine nonivamide, meprylcaine nonivamide, myrtecaine nonivamide, octacaine nonivamide, orthocaine nonivamide, piperocaine nonivamide, prilocaine nonivamide, procaine nonivamide, propanocaine nonivamide, propoxycaine nonivamide, pseudococaine nonivamide, pyrrocaine nonivamide, risocaine nonivamide, tetracaine nonivamide, and tolycaine nonivamide. In addition to capsaicin and nonivamide based compounds, homologs of capsaicin and nonivamide can also form the base of the compounds of the invention such as dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, n-vanillyl octanamide, n-vanillyl decanamide, n-vanillyl nonamide, n-vanillyl undecanamide, n-vanillyl paaipine acidamide, etc.<br>
The invention includes the compounds themselves, methods for their production, compositions comprising the compounds, and uses of the compounds and compositions. One important aspect of the invention involves a composition comprising one or more of the above-<br>
mentioned compounds and further comprising OBPA. A group of compounds will be referred to as the "other biocides" and the group includes: phenarsazine oxide (PZO), copper, cupric oxides, copper sulfides, cuprous oxides, copper pyrithione, zinc pyrithione, iodo propynyl butyl carbamate, metalaxyl, niclosamide, metaldehyde, fentin acetate, copper quinolinolate, copper thiocyanate, selenium disulfide, iodine, iodine pentoxide, "organo arsenicals", thimerosal, chlor-thalinal, organo-tins, triazines, organomercurials, octyl iso-thiazolone, and/or dichloro octyl iso thiazolone. The "organo arsenicals" include, but are not limited to, arsanilic acid, roxarsone, methyl arsonic acid, mono methyl arsinic acid, mono sodium methyl arsonate (MSMA), and cacodylic acid.<br>
One composition that is particularly effective is one comprising nonivamide and OBPA. Both OBPA and nonivamide are known antifoulants. However, mixing them together synergistically improves their performance. The results are significantly better than either OBPA or nonivamide separately. A composition comprising OBPA and nonivamide has antifouling properties that last 25% to 100% more than either OBPA or nonivamide separately. When a composition comprising OBPA and nonivamide is combined with other antifoulants such as one or more of the "other biocides" (see above for listing), the results improve by an additional 25-200%.<br>
The invention is also directed towards a composition comprising capsaicin and OBPA, which is an effective antifouling composition. However, using nonivamide instead of capsaicin provides longer protection than capsaicin and OBPA. Nonivamide is far more economical than capsaicin and more stable and easier to synthesize.<br>
The above-identified "caine compounds" and/or nonivamide have many uses. A composition comprising one or more of these "caine compounds" and/or nonivamide and further comprising OBPA and/or one or more of the "other biocides" is useful. Uses for the various compounds and compositions are that of local anaesthetic (topically or by injection), analgesic, desensitizing agent for diabetic neuropathy, and an antifoulant primarily for hard fouling (excellent for barnacles and zebra mussels). The compounds and compositions work exceptionally well with various co-biocides for soft fouling. The compounds and compositions also work well as irritants and sternutators in personal protection pepper sprays, neurodegenerators, counterirritants (delayed), rubifaciants, carminatives, stomachics, repellents for insects, birds, fish and animals, biocides, fungicides, mildewcides, circulatory stimulants, cardio-protective agents (depressant as anti-arrhythmic and fibrin dissolver), immune boosters, decongestants, and anti-inflammatory substances.    All the uses mentioned regarding this invention apply to the compounds themselves and to the compositions comprising one or more of the "caine compounds," and/or nonivamide, and/or capsaicinate, and/or OBPA and/or one or more of the "other biocides", and/or one or more antioxidants, and/or one or more UV absorbers. All the uses mentioned regarding the "caine compounds" also apply to the compounds taught by Examples 1-3 below.<br>

To synthesize lidocaine nonivamide, lidocaine or its HC1 is converted to the hydroxide with KOH and/or NaOH. This hydroxide is then reacted with nonivamide. The same procedure is followed to synthesize the other "caine compounds." Thus, lidocaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, cocaine, ambucaine, betoxycaine, butacaine, butoxycaine, dibucaine, etidocaine, fomocaine, hexylcaine, meprylcaine, myrtecaine, octacaine, orthocaine, piperocaine, prilocains, procaine, propanocaine, propoxycaine, pseudococaine, pyrrocaine, risocaine, tetracaine, tolycaine, and/or an HC1 of these compounds is converted to the hydroxide with KOH and/or NaOH and reacted with capsaicin and/or nonivamide to form the "caine compounds."<br>
The reactants necessary to synthesize the "caine compounds" are either commercially available or can be synthesized by methods known in the art by using commercially available chemicals. The procedure mentioned above regarding the synthesis of the "caine compunds" may need to be altered, in practice, to synthesize benzocaine nonivamide and/or benzocaine capsaicinate. Benzocaine does not form a long term stable HC1 or hydroxide so one option is for the reaction to be direct from base ethylaminobenzoate (also known as benzocaine) with capsaicin and/or nonivamide to form benzocaine capsaicinate and/or benzocaine nonivamide, although the yields are not as good as the yields for the hydroxide compounds that are made with KOH and/or NaOH. Another option to synthesize benzocaine nonivamide and/or benzocaine capsaicinate is to synthesize the HC1 of benzocaine and then, without storing this HC1 of benzocaine for extended periods of time because of the stability mentioned above, to react this HC1 of benzocaine with KOH and/or NaOH and then to react the resulting hydroxide of benzocaine with capsaicin and/or nonivamide. It should be noted that the reactions mentioned above with capsaicin and/or nonivamide can also be carried out with the homologs of capsaicin and nonivamide such as dihydrocapsaicin, nordihydrocapsaicin, homodihydrocapsaicin, homocapsaicin, n-vanillyl octanamide, n-vanillyl decanamide, n-vanillyl nonamide, n-vanillyl undecanamide, n-vanillyl paaipine acidamide, etc.<br>
Ivtany of the reactants mentioned above which are used to form the compounds of the present invention are commercially available and information on some of them is provided below.   It should be noted that any mention of capsaicin includes both the naturally-occurring as well as any that is synthesized.<br>

Example 1: Method of forming lidocaine nonivamide and/or lidocaine capsaicinate.<br>
About 500 ml of pure isopropanol is added to a three necked glass flask equipped with a stirrer (60-80 rpm), thermometer, reflux (straight-run) and condenser. About 10 g of KOH (based on 100 percent content) is added to the isopropanol with stirring. The reaction mass is heated to its boiling point and held until total dissolution of the KOH occurs. The solution is then cooled to about 50-55 degrees Celsius. About 60 g of lidocaine hydrochloride is added to the cooled solution. The mixture is stirred for thirty to forty minutes at about 50-55 degrees Celsius. The resulting solution is cooled to about 18-20 degrees Celsius and transferred to a filter with filtering paper, wherein potassium chloride precipitate is separated. The mother liquor is recycled to the same flask and about 60 g (total) of nonivamide and/or capsaicin is added. The reaction mixture is heated to its boiling point and refluxed for about 1-1.5 hours. The reflux condenser is then replaced with a straight run condenser and the isopropanol-water azeotrope, if<br><br>
any (the water being present, for example, as an impurity in the isopropanol), is distilled off. The reaction mass is boiled off to about 200 ml in volume, cooled to an ambient temperature, and transferred to a polyethylene or similar vessel and refrigerated at about 3-5 degrees Celsius for about ten to twelve hours. The precipitated crystals are filtered, washed on a filter with cyclohexane or petroleum ether, and air or vacuum dried at ambient temperature.<br>
Example 2: Method of forming benzocaine nonivamide and/or benzocaine capsaicinate.<br>
About 500 ml of pure isopropanol is added to a three necked glass flask equipped with a stirrer (60-80 rpm), thermometer, reflux (straight-run) and condenser. About 60 g of benzocaine is added to the isopropanol. About 60 g of nonivamide and/or capsaicin is added. The reaction mixture is heated to its boiling point and refluxed for about 1-1.5 hours. The reflux condenser is then replaced with a straight run condenser and the isopropanol-water azeotrope, if any (the water being present, for example, as an impurity in the isopropanol), is distilled off. The reaction mass is boiled off to about 200 ml in volume, cooled to an ambient temperature, and transferred to a polyethylene or similar vessel and refrigerated at about 3-5 degrees Celsius for about ten to twelve hours. The precipitated crystals are filtered, washed on a filter with cyclohexane or petroleum ether, and air or vacuum dried at ambient temperature.<br>
Example 3: Method of forming the "caine compounds."<br>
About 500 ml of pure isopropanol is added to a three necked glass flask equipped with a stirrer (60-80 rpm), thermometer, reflux (straight-run) and condenser. About 10 g of KOH (based on 100 percent content) is added to the isopropanol with stirring. The reaction mass is heated to its boiling point and held until total dissolution of the KOH occurs. The solution is then cooled to about 50-55 degrees Celsius. About 60 g (total) of a hydrochloride of lidocaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine, cocaine, ambucaine, betoxycaine, butacaine, butoxycaine, dibucaine, etidocaine, fomocaine, hexylcaine, meprylcaine, myrtecaine, octacaine, orthocaine, piperocaine, prilocaine, procaine, propanocaine, propoxycaine, pseudococaine, pyrrocaine, risocaine, tetracaine, and/or tolycaine is added to the cooled solution. The mixture is stirred for thirty to forty minutes at about 50-55 degrees Celsius. The resulting solution is cooled to about 18-20 degrees Celsius and transferred to a filter with filtering paper, wherein potassium chloride precipitate is separated. The mother liquor is recycled to the same flask and about 60 g (total) of nonivarnide and/or capsaicin is added. The reaction mixture is heated to its boiling point and refluxed for about 1-1.5 hours. The reflux condenser is then replaced with a straight run condenser and the isopropanol-water azeotrope, if any (the water being present, for example, as an impurity in the isopropanol), is distilled off. The reaction mass is boiled off to about 200 ml in volume, cooled to an ambient temperature, and transferred to a polyethylene or similar vessel and refrigerated at about 3-5 degrees Celsius for about ten to twelve hours. The precipitated crystals are filtered, washed on a filter with cyclohexane or petroleum ether, and air or vacuum<br>
dried at ambient temperature.<br>
