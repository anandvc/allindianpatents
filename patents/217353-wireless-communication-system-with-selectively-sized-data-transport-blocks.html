				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to wireless communication system configured to utilize selectively sized data transport blocks and, in particular, the selective sizing of data blocks for wireless transport of data in an efficient manner.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Radio interfaces such as those proposed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3G) use Transport Channels (TrCHs) for transfer of user data and signaling between User Equipment (UH), such as a Mobile 1 erminal (Ml), and a Base Station (BS) or other device within node of a communication network. In 3G lime Division Duplex (1 DD), TrCHs are a composite oi one or more physical channels defined by mutual!} exclusive physical resources. TrCH data is transferred in sequential groups of Transport Blocks (IBs) defined as Transport Block Sets (TBSs). Each TBS is transmitted in a given Transmission Time Interval (TTI). User Equipment (UE) and Base Station (BS) physical reception of TrCHs require knowledge of Transport Block (TB) sizes.<br>
For each TrCH, a Transport Format Set (TFS) is specified containing Transport Formats (TFs). Each TF, defines a TBS composed of a specified number of TBs where each IB preferably has the same size within a given TBS. Thus, a finite number of potential IB sizes are defined with respect to each TrCH.<br>
Radio Resource Control (RRC) signaling is required Vtv\ oen the BS and UL' to define the attributes oi each established Irt'JH, including a list ol potential IB sixes. Signaling over the radio interlace introduces system overhead, winch reduces the physical resources available for user data transmission. Therefore, it is important to minimize RRC signaling and the number of potential TrCH TB sizes respectively.<br>
All data transferred by specific TrCHs must fit into the 'IB sizes specified for the ITS oi a particular TK'll. However, variable size data blocks exist that can not be predicted, for Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core Network (CN) signaling data, as uell as Non-Real Time (NRT) user data transmissions.<br>
To allow for the transfer of variable size data blocks, a Radio Link Control (RLC) provides a segmentation and re-assembly multiplexing function and a padding function. 1 he segmentation and re-assembly multiplexing function reduces the size prior to transmission RJLC and is used when the transferred data block is larger then the maximum allowed TB size. The padding function increases the data block or segmented data block size by padding with extra bits to fit a TB size.<br>
Segmentation and re-assembly of data over more than one TT1 is permitted for some, but not all, types of data. In 3G, it is not permitted, for example, for Common Control Channel (CCCH) logical data. Thus, the payload requirements for a TrCH carrying logical CCCH data are inherently restricted.<br>
The RLC processing results in blocks of data call Protocol Data Units (PDUs). A certain amount of each RLC PDU is required for control information. Using a relatively small RLC PDU results in a lower transfer data to control information ratio consequently resulting in a less efficient use of radio resources. The RLC padding function is used when the transferred data block is not equal to any oi the allowed TB sizes. Likewise, the greater the difference between the transferred data block size and the next larger allowed TB size results in lowering the transfer data to used physical resources ratio consequently resulting in a less efficient use of radio resources. Therefore, it is important to maximize the number of potential IB si/es.<br>
1 oweriiiL' the number of TB sizes reduces RR(" Mi&gt;naliny overhead and increases radio interface efficiency. Increasing the number of IB sizes reduces RLC ovcihead and increases radio interface efficiency. It is therefore important to make the best use of the specified TB sizes for each TrCH.<br>
TB sizes are the sum of the RLC PDU size and a Medium Access Control (MAC') header si/c. The MAC header size is dependent of the class of traffic, which is indicated by the Logical Channel type. A Target Channel Type Field (TCTF) is provided in the MAC' header to indicate to which logical channel a TB is assigned. A TrCH can support multiple logical channel types. This means that the finite number of allowed TB sizes must support several MAC" header sizes.<br>
For RAN and CN signaling data and NRT user data, the RLC generates octet aligned (8 bit quantities) PDU sizes. Thus, the RLC PDUs are defined as groups of a selected number of octets, such that the RLC PDU bit size is always evenly divided by eight, i.e. the RLC" PDU bit size always equals 0 modulo 8. This characteristic is maintained even when padding is required.<br>
Applicant has recognized that, if MAC header sizes for different Logical Channel types have mutually exclusive bit offsets, IB sizes cannot be genencally used for all transmissions. TB sizes have to be defined for specific MAC' headers and logical channels respectivdv. 1 his increases signaling overhead and reduces RLC" PDU size options, which results in less efficient use of radio resources.<br>
Specifying octet aligned MAC header sizes as is currently done in some 3'u generation systems allows for some sharing of TB sizes between different Logical Channel types, but also increases MAC signaling overhead since the MAC header size must be at least 8 bits in such situations. In 3rd generation TDD mode, certain TrCFI and Logical Channel combinations have very limited transfer block sizes and increasing MAC" overhead should be avoided. Therefore, in FDD, TB size definitions are specific to Logical Channel specific MAC' header bit offsets, and as described, reduces overall radio resource efficiency.<br>
Applicant has recognized that without common MAC header bit offsets, it is not possible for MT down dink and BS up-lir.k transmissions to octet align received lramc
TrCH's. Applicant has recogni/.ed that with TrClI specific bit aligned MAC" headers, bit shifting is known at the physical layer and no additional processing overhead is introduced.<br>

A CDMA telecommunication system utilizes a plurality of protocol layers including a physical layer and a medium access control (MAC) layer such that the MAC layer provides data to the<br>
physical layer via plurality of transport channels (TrC'lls). Each transport channel (TrCH) is associated with a set of logical channels for transporting logical channel data within transport channel data. At least one TrCl 1 is associated with a set of logical channels having at least two logical channels of different types.<br>
The physical layer receives blocks of data for transport such that the transport blocks (TBs) of data includes of a MAC header and logical channel data for one of the TrCHs. Each TB transports data for a given TrCH such that the logical channel data includes data associated with a selected logical channel from the set of logical channels associated with the given TrCH. Each TB has one of a selected limited finite number of TB bit sizes. The logical channel data for each TB has a bit si/e evenly divisible by a selected integer N greater than three (3). N is preferably eight (S) so that the logical data is in the iorm of an Kl.( i'tHJ defined in terms oi octets of data bits. Preferably the data manipulation and formatting is performed by one or more computer processors.<br>
The MAC header for each TB includes data identifying the selected logical channel and has a bit size such that the MAC header bit size plus the logical channel data bit size equals one of the TB bit sizes. The MAC header bit size is fixed for TBs transporting data for the same TrCH and same selected logical channel, but may be different from the MAC header bit size for TBs transporting data for either a different TrCH or a different selected logical channel.<br>
Preferably, for TrCHs associated with a set of multiple types of logical channels, a fixed MAC header bit size is associated with each logical channel within the set of logical channels and is selected such that each fixed MAC header bit size equals M modulo N where M is an integer greater than 0 and less than N. This results in a MAC" header bit offset of M which is the same for all MAC headers associated with a given 1 rC 11. This allows for a MAC header to be smaller than N in size. Thus, when N is X. such as- for octet alitmed RI.C PDI is. a MAC header can be smaller than one octet of data.<br>
Preferably, each MAC header has a data field for data identifying the selected type of logical channel associated with the logical channel data. A bit size of that data field is preferably<br>
selected to determine the modulo N bit size of the MAC header, i.e. the MAC header bit offset. A shortest data field bit size is preferably provided for the data field of the MAC header of one or more logieal channels of the set associated with the respective TrCH such that the logical channels designated by the shortest data field size are collectively more frequently used with the respective TrCH than any other logieal channel within the associate set of logical channels. Alternatively, the shortest data field bit size may be associated with the most restricted TrCH logical channel combination payload requirement.<br>
Preferably, the TrCHs includes a forward access channel (FACH) associated with a set of logical channels including a dedicated traffic channel (D'l'CH), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a shared channel control channel (SI1CCI1), a common control channel (CCCH) and a common traffic channel (CTCH). and a random access channel (RACH) associated with a set of logical channels including the DTCH, the DCCH, the SHCCH and the CCCH. In such case, each MAC header preferably has a Target Channel fype Field (TCTF) for data identifying the selected logical channel type associated with the transport channel data where a bit size of the TCTF field is selected to determine the modulo N bit size M of the MAC header. The modulo N bit size M of the MAC header is preferably 3 modulo 8 for FACH and 2 modulo 8 for RACH.<br>
The TCTF data field bit size is preferably 3 with respect to FACH MAC headers associated with the CCCH, DCCH, SCCH and BCCH logical channels. The TCTF data field bit size is preferably 5 with respect to the FACH MAC headers associated with the DCCH and DTCH logical channels. The TCTF data field bit size is preferably 2 with respect to RACH MAC headers associated with the CCCH and SHCC11 logical channels. The TCTF data field bit size is preferably 4 with respect to the RACH MAC headers associated with the DCCH and DTCH logical channels.<br>

Detailed Description of The Invcntion<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a simplified wireless spread spectrum code division multiple access (CUMA) communication system 18. A node b 26 within the system 18 communicates with associated user equipment (UE) 20-24 such as a mobile terminal (MT). The node h 26 has a single site controller (SC) 30 associated with cither a single base station (BS) 28 (shown in Figure 1) or multiple base stations. A Group of node bs 26, 32, 34 is connected to a radio network controller (RNCj 36. To transfer communications between RNCs 36-40, an interface (IUR) 42 between the RNCs is utilized. Hach RNC 36-40 is connected to a mobile switching center (MSC) 44 which in turn is connected to the Core Network (CN) 46.<br>
To communicate within the system 18, many types of communication channels are used, such as dedicated, shared and common. Dedicated physical channels transfer data between a node b 26 and a particular Ut 20-24. Common and shared channels are used by multiple UHs 20-24 or<br>
oi^eis.   All oi these channels caiiy j -.aiicly of data including traffic, control and signaling data.<br>
Since shared and common channels carry data for different users, data is sent using protocol data units (PDL-s) or packets. .As shown in Figure 2, lo regulate the flo\\ of data from differing sources 48, 50, 52 into a channel 56, a controller 54 is used.<br>
One common channel used for transmitting data to the Ulis 20-24 is a forward access channel<br>
(l-'ACH) 58. As shown in Figure 3, the FACH 58 originates in a RNC 36 and is sent to a node b 28-34 for wireless transmission as a spread spectrum signal to the UHs 20-24. The FACH 58 carries several data types from various sources, such as a common control channel (CCCH), dedicated control and traffic channel (DCCH and DTCH), and a downlink and uplink shared channel (DSCH and USCH) control signaling via a shared control logical channel (SHCCH). The FACH 58 also carries control signaling out of band and similar data transmitted via the 1UR 42 from other RNCs 38-40, such as CCCH, DCCH and DTCH control data.<br>
Various controllers are used by the RNC 36 to control the flow of data. A radio link controller (RLC) 64 handles the CCCH. A dedicated medium access controller (MAC-d) 66 handles the DCCH. the DTCH. A shared medium access controller (MAC-sh) 68 handles the DSCH, USCH control signaling. Controlling the FACH 58 is a common medium access controller (MAC-c) 60<br>
With reference to Figure 4, there is illustrated a preferred channel mapping with respect to the MAC layer 70 and the physical layer 72. The transport channels (TrClls) 74 transport data over the physical layer 72 to associated physical channels 76. Each of the TrCHs 74 is associated with one or more logical channels 78. The TrCHs communicate by using transport blocks (TB) which are comprised of a MAC header and associated logical channel data in a RLC PDU. The MAC header has logical channel identification information. Preferably, the RLC PDU is defined by data octets, so that the RLC PDU bit size equals 0 modulo 8.<br>
Preferably, the TrCHs 74 include a dedicated channel (DCH). a downlink shared channel (DSCH), a common packet channel (CPCH), a random access channel (RACH), a forward access channel (FACH), a paging channel (i'CIl) a,id a brixsucusi channel (BCH). The associated physical channels include a dedicated physical channel (DPDCH), a physical downlink shared channel (DPSCH) a physical common packet channel (PCPCF1). a physical random access channel (PRACH), a secondary common control physical channel (SCCPCH) and a primary common control physical channel (PCCPCH). Other transport and physical channels may be supported, such as an uplink shared channel (USCH) with an associated physical uplink shared channel (PUSCH).<br>
The logical channels preferably include a dedicated traffic channel (I.)T(TI), a dedicated control channel (DCCH), a shared control channel (SHCX'H), a common control channel (CCCH), a common traffic channel (CTCH), a paging control channel (PCCH) and a broadcast control channel (BCCH).<br>
The preferred association of transport channels with physical and logical channels is illustrated in Figure 4. For example, the FACI1 may transport data to the SCCPCH from any one of the set of logical channels including the DTCH, the DCCH, the SHCCH, the CCCH, or the CTCH. Similarly, the RACH transports data to the PRACH from any one of the set of logical channels including the DTCH, the DC'CII, the SHCCH, or the CCCII.<br>
In order to make efficient use of TBS size definitions, it is desirable to be able to use all specified TB sizes for all Logical Channel types supported by a respective TrCH. This allows the number of specified TFs for a TFS to be minimized thereby reducing signaling overhead, while maximizing the number of RLC PDU size options reducing the overhead associated with RLC segmentation and padding. TB and TBS assignment is accomplished without increasing MAC header sizes for TrCH logical channel combinations that support limited TB data payloads, i.e. the amount of data processed as a single unit from higher layers within MAC and RLC'.<br>
A bit aligned MAC header resolves both the radio resource efficiency issues associated with TB size signaling and RLC' segmentation and padding overhead. The alignment is performed by maintaining the minimum size MAC" headers for the Logical Channel and TrCH combinations that support limited TB data payload sizes, and increasing MAC1 headers for non- data payload<br>
si/c sensitive combinations to the same bi! off-,cL<br>
For example, if the data payload size limited combinations have MAC headers of X octets (lota! octets) • Y bn (extra bit ollsel, less than 8) sizes, and non-limited combination have headers of A octets + C bits and B octets + D bits. Then the C and D bits are adjusted to match Y bits. In some cases this means A and/or B octets must be incremented by one octet. It is not nece^sar\ for A and B octet sizes to match the X octet size since TB size = MAC" header + RLC PDU and<br>
the octet aligned RLC PDU will conform to the available octet size. MAC" headers less than an octet in length are permitted, and in fact desirable, in such cases X. A or B may be 0.<br>
All TB sizes specified by RRC signaling for a specific TrCH channel will have a Y bit offset. That Y bit offset being applicable to the MAC headers for all Logical Channels supported by the specific TrCH. Since the MAC header octet sizes do not necessarily match between different Logical Channel types, RLC entities will correspondingly generate appropriate RLC PDU sizes to conform to the allowed TB sizes. This does not necessarily mean RLC PDU's have to be resized when switching between TrCH types, since it is always possible to adjust the difference in MAC header size between the new and old TrCH's in the allowed TB sizes.<br>
With bit aligned MAC headers, each IrCll type may have ;.
The invention has the additional benefit of removing processor intensive la\er 2 bit shifting requirements in the UE and BS equipment. With a common TB size bit offset for all Logical Channels types supported by a specific TrCH, it is possible for received radio transmissions to be bit shifted by the physical layer according to higher layer requirements. It is advantageous to provide bit shifting at the physical layer which is already involved in bit manipulations without adding additional overhead, as opposed to adding this requirement to the higher layer processing requirements.<br>
In X, ^\.&gt;tc:ri d^ign, RLC and Radio Rex.».;rc, receive data blocks which start on octet boundaries. If MAC headers for specific irCH's have variable bit otlsets n is only possible to avoid bit shifting in BS down-link and Ml up-link transmission:-,. In the Ml down-link and BS up-link ca&gt;cs it is not possible for the physical layer to be aware of the higher layer logical channel type that defines the bit offset. Only if the bit offset is common for all transmissions across the specific transport channel can bit processing be avoided in communication layers 2 and 3.<br>
RRC Transport Format Set (TI;S) signaling is used to define Transport Block (TB) sizes for each define Transport Format (TF) allowed on a specific TrCH. The number of possible TB sizes should be minimized to reduce the signaling load. It is also necessary to choose TB sizes wisely since RLC PDU padding can dramatically increase transmission overhead.<br>
Preferably, there is a maximum of 32 possible TB size.s in each TrCH's TFS. Specifying all 32 results in a significant signalling load that should be avoided. Although it is also important to have as many choices as possible on transport channels which have variable transmissions since RLC Acknowledged Mode (AM) and Unacknowledged Mode (IJM) PDU's will be padded to match the next larger TB size when the previous lower size is exceeded.<br>
1 he relation between RLC PDU and TB sizes is as follows: IB Size - MAC' Header Size + RLC PDU Size.<br>
In the preferred RLC AM and UM, the PDU size is always octet aligned and in Time Division Duplex (TDD) a variable non-octet aligned MAC header exists. Therefore, MAC individual bit offsets must be taken into account when specifying the allowed IB sizes.<br>
In TDD, with the exception of DTCH/DCCH all logical channel combinations on the FACH and separately on the RACH are modified from the prior art to have the same bit offset (+2 bits foi RACTI and +3 bits for FACH when multiple logical channels are allowed), fable 1 reflects a preferred prior art MAC header siz.e specification.<br>
Table 1]<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note 1: SHCCH does not require TCTF when SHCCH is the only channel assigned to RACH or FACH.<br>
With the prior art MAC header definitions, octet aligned AM and UM RFC payloads will result in two possible TB size bit offsets on RACH and FACH when multiple logical channel types are applied. Octet + 1 or 3 bits for FACH and octet t 0 or 2. bits for RACH. This potentially doubles the number of Transport Foimats that need to be specified on RACII and FACH.<br>
To increase the efficiency of TFS signaling and allow for more RFC" PDU size choices, it is necessary to have a common TB si/e bit offset. Increasing MAC header sizes for CCCH, SHCCH, CTCH and BCCH, should be avoided since these channels operate in RLC TM where RLC segmentation across multiple radio frame TTIs is not possible. Therefore, the preferred solution is to increase the DCCH/DTCH TCTF by 2 bits on RACH and FACH. A preferred coding is reflected in Tables 2 and 3 below, respectively for FACH and RACH. This results in common RACH TB sizes of octet+2. i.e. 2 modulo 8, and FACH TB sizes of octet+3, i.e. 3 modulo 8.<br>
Another benefu of MAC' header bit alignment is ihe abiiuy to remove tne Li: and RNC layer 2 bit shifting requirement. The RFC generates and expects to receive octet aligned PDlI's. With variable bit shifted MAC header.- o:ih UK TTRAN IXm M [.in!; (!&gt;!.) ;;,K] !:]; [ |r. i jp]: (T[ ; MAC PDU's could avoid layer 2 bit shifting by padding the MAC header and providing a padding indicator to the physical layer. This is not possible for the UF DL and UTRAN UF transmissions since physical layer is unaware of the logical channel type on RACH and FACH.<br>
If the I rCI I bit oitset is constant for all logical channel types supported lor a given TrCH, the physical layer can pad the MAC" header to octet align the UF DI. and UTRAN UL. No padding indicator is needed in HI., or DL since the padaing is constant for the '1 r( 'H.<br>
The number of TFs specifying TB sizes allowed in each TFS on a specific TrCH should be minimi/ed to reduce the layer 3 signaling load. It is also necessary to allow a maximum number of octet aligned RFC PDU sixes in AM and UM for efficieni transfer of DCCH/DTCH data. In TDD mode bit shifted MAC headers potentially doubles the number of TFs that need to be defined on RACH and FACT! TrCHs. Additionally, variable bit shifted MAC headers result in requiring layer 2 bit shifting for all UE DL and UTRAN UL transmissions on RACH and FACH. MAC header bit alignment is defined to avoid duplication of IB si/.e definitions for octet aligned RLC PDUs and layer.' bit shilling.<br>
As in the prior art. the MAC header preferably includes a Target Channel Type Field (TCTF). The TCTF field is a flag that provides identification of the logical channel type on FACll and RACH transport channels, i.e. whether it carries BCCII, CCCH, CTCH, SHCCH or dedicated logical channel information. Unlike the prior art. the preferred size and coding of TCTF for TDD are shown in Tables 2 and 3.<br>
Table 2:  C.'oding of the Target Channel Type Field on FACH for 11)D<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note that the preferred si/,e of the TCTF field of FAC1I for TDl) is either 3 or 5 bits depending on the value of the 3 most significant bits. The preferred TCTF of the RACI1 for TDD is either 2 or 4 bus depending on the value of the 2 most significant bits.<br>
Bit aligned MAC' headers allow common TB sizes to be defined for different logical channels on the same TrCH. Common TB sizes reduce signalling overhead and potentially increase the options for Rl.C PDl; si/.es, which increases system efficiency by reducing the need for padding in AM and DM.<br>
This is especially important for RACH and FACH channels where a common TrCH supports many different traffic types. Optimally for RACH and FACII, each TB size specified can apply to DCC'H, ('('CM. i,'ICH. SHCCH and DK'll. !o allow this capability in octet mode it is preferred to specify the total number of octets not just the number of RLC FDD octets.<br>
By specifying the total number of octets, it is not necessary to indicate the TDD MAC" header type on common channels since the header offset is the same for all logical channel types. It is also possible to avoid RLC' PDU resizing transport channel switching by taking into account the change in MAC" header octet offset. Table 4 is a preferred specification for a Transport Format Set (TFS) in a 3Ci system.<br>

NOTES  2:	For dedicated channels, 'RLC size' reflects RLC PDl -: size. In FDD for common<br>
channels 'RLC size' reflects actual TB size. In TDD for common channels since MAC headers are not octet aligned, to calculate IB si/.e trie MAC' header bit offset is added 10 the specified size (similar to the dedicated case). Therefore for TDD DCH TrCHs the 4 bit C/T is added if MAC multiplexing is applied, for FACT! the 3 bit TCTF offset is added and for RACH the 2 bit TCTF offset is added.<br>
