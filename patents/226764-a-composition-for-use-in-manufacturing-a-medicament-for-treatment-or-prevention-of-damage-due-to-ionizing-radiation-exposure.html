				<td>A COMPOSITION FOR USE IN MANUFACTURING A MEDICAMENT FOR TREATMENT OR<br>
PREVENTION OF DAMAGE DUE TO IONIZING RADIATION EXPOSURE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
 [001] The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/488,097, filed July 18, 2003.<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
[002] The present invention relates to the field of the treatment or prevention of<br>
 damage due to radiation.<br>
2. Description of the Background Art<br>
[003] For decades, ionizing radiation has frequently been used as a modality for the<br>
treatment of many types of cancers and tissue abnormalities. Although control of the<br>
 delivery of such radiation has improved, the fact that it cannot be precisely controlled in<br>
many areas of the body confers certain unwanted biological side effects, including the<br>
destruction of healthy tissue, radiation burns and sickness, and other similar damage<br>
such as disruption of tissue and cellular architecture, structural changes in cytoskeletal<br>
organization and disruption of the structural organization of actin and various<br>
 degenerative, immunological, and other injuries to the blood, blood vessels,<br>
microvasculatures, healthy tissues and organs secondary to radiation therapy. In<br>
particular the efficacy of therapy in cancer patients and other patients receiving<br>
radiation treatments is currently limited by the significant damage to surrounding<br>
healthy tissues which includes increased inflammatory responses and the release of<br>
 toxic intermediates including inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, eicosanoids and<br>
metabolites that limit the effective dose of ionizing radiation in patients.<br>
[004] Radiation from other sources, including sunlight, gamma rays, X-rays, nuclear<br>
equipment, nuclear facilities, nuclear bombs, "dirty" bombs, high voltage electrical<br>
current, etc., can cause damage, sometimes severe, to tissues of exposed subjects.<br>
 [005] There remains a need in the art for improved methods and compositions for<br>
treating or preventing the damage caused by radiation exposure.<br><br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[006] In accordance with the present invention, a method of treatment or prevention<br>
of damage due to radiation exposure comprising administering to a subject in need of<br>
such treatment an effective amount of a composition comprising 1) a compound<br>
 including a radiation damage-inhibiting polypeptide comprising amino acid sequence<br>
LKKTET, a conservative variant of LKKTET, an actin-sequestering agent, an anti-<br>
inflammatory agent; 2) an agent which stimulates production of said compound in said<br>
subject; 3) an agent which regulates said compound in said subject; or 4} an antagonist<br>
of said compound, so as to inhibit radiation damage in said subject.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[007] In accordance with one embodiment, the present invention relates generally to<br>
the treatment, prevention or reversal of physical, cognitive, and biological injuries<br>
resulting from exposure to ionizing radiation by the use of the peptide, Thymosin beta 4<br>
 (Thymosin p4 or TP4), or fragments of Tp4 such as LKKTET, or conservative variants<br>
thereof. Sometimes these are referred to as LKKTET peptides or polypeptides. Included<br>
are N- or C-tenninal variants such as KLKKTET and LKKTETQ.<br>
[008] Over 50% of all cancer patients receive radiation therapy to reduce tumor size.<br>
The efficacy of radiotherapy is dose limiting due to the toxic side effects of radiation and<br>
 the disruption of normal tissue architecture and inflammatory, degenerative and<br>
immunological effects to surrounding tissues due either to the direct effects of the x-rays<br>
or gamma-rays or to side effects resulting from the release of toxic amounts of tissue and<br>
cellular debris from the tumors. As up to 10% of the total protein in tumors is actin and<br>
50% of this protein is sequestered in its monomeric form when the G-actin is released<br>
 into the blood following destruction of tumor tissues, the physico-chemical properties of<br>
the blood induces the polymerization of the G-actin into F-actin, the fibril form of this<br>
molecule. This flood of F-actin overwhelms the actin-sequestering properties of the<br>
blood and can result in severe pathologies. F-actin alone, when administered to<br>
experimental animals, has significant toxicity and is thought to play role in the multi-<br>
 organ failure, ARDS and other syndromes associated with septic shock. A number of<br>
tissues such as the stem cells of the bone marrow, the lymphoid tissues such as the<br>
spleen and lymph nodes and the endothelial cells of the gut, have long been known to<br>
be highly sensitive to the deleterious effects of ionizing radiation. The deleterious<br>
effects on these tissues have previously been attributed to either direct or indirect effects<br><br><br><br>
due to the release of adrenal cortical steroids or to a variety of other additional<br>
hormones and growth factors. In addition, the structural disorganization of actin due to<br>
direct or indirect effects of radiation is thought to contribute significantly to the<br>
toxicities observed. Some of the growth factors which include inflammatory cytokines<br>
 and chemokines and other agents such as eicosinoids may contribute significantly to the<br>
side effects and current limitations of radiotherapy. Tβ4, analogs and isoforms and<br>
other derivatives, by virtue of their unique properties when administered systemically,<br>
locally or topically, are effective in reducing the toxic side effects of radiotherapy.<br>
Furthermore, the unique properties of Tβ4 include radio-protective effects, thus<br>
 allowing increased effective doses of radiation therapy. The invention also is applicable<br>
to treatment or prevention of damage due to radiation from other sources, including<br>
sunlight, x-rays, gamma rays, nuclear equipment, nuclear facilities, nuclear bombs,<br>
"dirty" bombs, high voltage electrical current and other sources of radiation.<br>
[009] Without being bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the present<br>
 invention is based on the discovery that anti-inflammatory peptides and actin -<br>
sequestering peptides such as Tβ4 and a number of other actin-sequestering peptides<br>
which contain the actin binding motif and amino acid sequence LKKTET, are useful for<br>
the treatment or prevention of certain biological processes which occur due to exposure<br>
to ionizing radiation, and promote treatment or prevention of damage due to ionizing<br>
 radiation exposure. These peptides have the capacity to promote repair and healing by<br>
having the ability to induce terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (a non-template<br>
directed DNA polymerase), to decrease the levels of one or more inflammatory cytokines<br>
and chemokines and to act as a chemotactic and angiogenic factors for endothelial cells,<br>
and thus prevent and/or heal and reverse effects that occur due to a number of factors,<br>
 including exposure to certain x-rays, gamma-rays or other forms of ionizing radiation<br>
and radiotherapy of (i) cancer patients, (ii) patients receiving radiation or photo-therapy<br>
for skin disorders, or (iii) individuals exposed to acute or lethal doses of ionizing<br>
radiation. T34 may act as a "rescue molecule", preventing permanent polymerization of<br>
actin, preserving the function of actin in cells exposed to radiation and protecting the<br>
 ability of normal cells to divide. Tβ4 may inhibit induction of enzymes which induce<br>
apoptosis, thereby inhibiting induction of apoptosis of normal cells which may be<br>
caused by radiation. Tβ4 may also prevent damage to tissue by modulation of<br>
transcription factors associated with improved survival of tissue. Tβ4 forms a functional<br>
ternary complex with LIM domain protein PINCH and Integrin Linked Kinase (ILK),<br>
 which are essential for cell survival. Tβ4 exposure results in induction, altered<br><br><br><br>
localization and activation of ILK. Formation of a TP4-PINCH-ILK complex in cells may<br>
mediate the protection and/or repair effects of Tβ4 independently of actin<br>
polymerization. Additionally, Tβ4 stimulates the production of laminin-5 in cells which<br>
may protect, or facilitate repair of, tissue.<br>
 [0010] Tβ4 was initially identified as a protein that is up-regulated during endothelial<br>
cell migration and differentiation in vitro. Tβ4 was originally isolated from the thymus<br>
and is a 43 amino acid, 4.9 kDa ubiquitous polypeptide identified in a variety of tissues.<br>
Several roles have been ascribed to this protein including a role in a endothelial cell<br>
differentiation and migration, T cell differentiation, actin sequestration and<br>
 vascularization.<br>
[0011] In accordance with one embodiment, the invention is a method of treatment<br>
or prevention of damage due to ionizing radiation exposure comprising administering to<br>
a subject in need of such treatment an effective amount of a composition comprising a<br>
radiation damage-inhibiting polypeptide comprising LKKTET, or a conservative variant<br>
 thereof having radiation damage-inhibiting activity, preferably Tβ4, an isoform of Tβ4,<br>
oxidized Tβ4, Tβ4 sulfoxide, or an antagonist of Tβ4. Administration can be before,<br>
during or after exposure of the subject to radiation, so as to protect tissue and prevent<br>
damage, and/or salvage and repair tissue.<br>
[0012] Preferred compositions which may be used in accordance with the present<br>
 invention comprise amino acid sequence LKKTET, amino acid sequence KLKKTET or<br>
LKKTETQ, Tβ4, an N-terminal variant of Tβ4, a C-terminal variant of Tβ4, an isoform of<br>
Tβ4, a splice-variant of Tβ4, oxidized Tβ4, Tβ4 sulfoxide, lymphoid Tβ4, pegylated Tβ4<br>
or any other actin sequestering or bundling proteins having actin binding domains, or<br>
peptide fragments comprising or consisting essentially of the amino acid sequence<br>
 LKKTET or conservative variants thereof, having radiation damage-inhibiting activity.<br>
International Application Serial No. PCT/US99/17282, incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses isoforms of Tβ4 which may be useful in accordance with the present invention<br>
as well as amino acid sequence LKKTET and conservative variants thereof, which may<br>
be utilized with the present invention. International Application Serial No.<br>
 PCT/GB99/00833 (WO 99/49883), incorporated herein by reference, discloses oxidized<br>
Tβ4 which may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. Although the<br>
present invention is described primarily hereinafter with respect to Tβ4 and Tβ4<br>
isofonns, it is to be understood that the following description is intended to be equally<br>
applicable to amino acid sequence LKKTET, KLKKTET, LKKTETQ, peptides and<br>
 fragments comprising or consisting essentially of LKKTET, KLKKTET or LKKTETQ,<br><br><br><br>
conservative variants thereof, as well as oxidized Tβ4 and Tβ4 sulfoxide, having<br>
radiation damage-inhibiting activity.<br>
[0013] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for healing radiation<br>
damage in a subject by contacting an area to be treated with an effective amount of a<br>
 radiation damage-inhibiting composition which contains Tβ4 or a Tβ4 isoform. The<br>
contacting may be topically, systemically, enterally, by pulmonary delivery, etc.<br>
Examples of topical administration include, for example, contacting the skin with a<br>
lotion, salve, gel, cream, paste, spray, suspension, dispersion, hydrogel, ointment, or oil<br>
comprising Tβ4, alone or in combination with at least one agent that enhances Tp4<br>
 penetration, or delays or slows release of Tβ4 peptides into the area to be treated.<br>
Systemic administration includes, for example, intravenous, intraperitoneal,<br>
intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, or inhalation, transdermal or oral<br>
administration of a composition containing Tβ4 or a Tβ4 isoform, etc. Enteral<br>
administration may include oral or rectal administration. A subject may be a mammal,<br>
 preferably human.<br>
[0014] Tβ4, or its analogues, isoforms or derivatives, may be administered in any<br>
effective amount. For example, Tβ4 may be administered in dosages within the range of<br>
about 0.1-50 micrograms of Tβ4, more preferably in amounts of about 1-25 micrograms.<br>
[0015] A composition in accordance with the present invention can be administered<br>
 daily, every other day, etc., with a single administration or multiple administrations per<br>
day of administration, such as applications 2, 3, 4 or more times per day of<br>
administration.<br>
[0016] Tβ4 isoforms have been identified and have about 70%, or about 75%, or<br>
about 80% or more homology to the known amino acid sequence of Tβ4. Such isoforms<br>
 include, for example, Tβ4ala, Tβ9, Tβ10, Tβ11, Tβ12, Tβ13, Tβ14 and Tβ15. Similar to<br>
Tβ4, the Tβ10 and Tβ15 isoforms have been shown to sequester actin. Tβ4, Tβ10 and<br>
Tβ15, as well as these other isoforms share an amino acid sequence, LKKTET, that<br>
appears to be involved in mediating actin sequestration or binding. Although not<br>
wishing to be bound to any particular theory, the activity of Tβ4 isoforms may be due, in<br>
 part, to the ability to regulate the polymerization of actin. For example, Tβ4 can<br>
modulate actin polymerization in skin (e.g. P-thymosins appear to depolymerize F-actin<br>
by sequestering free G-actin). Tβ4's ability to modulate actin polymerization may<br>
therefore be due to all, or in part, its ability to bind to or sequester actin via the LKKTET<br>
sequence. Thus, as with Tβ4, other proteins which bind or sequester actin, or modulate<br><br><br><br>
actin polymerization, including Tβ4 isoforms having the amino acid sequence LKKTET,<br>
are likely to prevent or reduce radiation damage alone or in a combination with Tβ4, as<br>
set forth herein.<br>
[0017] Thus, it is specifically contemplated that known Tβ4 isoforms, such as Tβ4ala,<br>
 Tβ9, Tβ10, Tβ11, Tβ12, Tβ13, Tβ14 and Tβ15, as well as Tβ4 isoforms not yet identified,<br>
will be useful in the methods of the invention. As such Tp4 isoforms are useful in the<br>
methods of the invention, including the methods practiced in a subject. The invention<br>
therefore further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising Tβ4, as well as Tβ4<br>
isoforms Tβ4ala, Tβ9, Tβ10, Tβ11, Tβ12, Tβ13, Tβ14 and Tβ15, and a pharmaceutically<br>
 acceptable carrier.<br>
[0018] In addition, other proteins having actin sequestering or binding capability, or<br>
that can mobilize actin or modulate actin polymerization, as demonstrated in an<br>
appropriate sequestering, binding, mobilization or polymerization assay, or identified by<br>
the presence of an amino acid sequence that mediates actin binding, such as LKKTET,<br>
 for example, can similarly be employed in the methods of the invention. Such proteins<br>
include gelsolin, vitamin D binding protein (DBP), profilin, cofilin, adsevertin,<br>
propomyosin, fincilin, depactin, Dnasel, vilin, fragmin, severin, capping protein, β-<br>
actinin and acumentin, for example. As such methods include those practiced in a<br>
subject, the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
 gelsolin, vitamin D binding protein (DBP), profilin, cofilin, depactin, Dnasel, vilin,<br>
fragmin, severin, capping protein, β-actinin and acumentin as set forth herein. Thus,<br>
the invention includes the use of a radiation damage-inhibiting polypeptide comprising<br>
the amino acid sequence LKKTET (which may be within its primary amino acid<br>
sequence) and conservative variants thereof.<br>
 [0019] As used herein, the term "conservative variant" or grammatical variations<br>
thereof denotes the replacement of an amino acid residue by another, biologically<br>
similar residue. Examples of conservative variations include the replacement of a<br>
hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or methionine for another, the<br>
replacement of a polar residue for another, such as the substitution of arginine for<br>
 lysine, glutamic for aspartic acids, or glutamine for asparagine, and the like.<br>
[0020] Tβ4 has been localized to a number of tissue and cell types and thus, agents<br>
which stimulate the production of Tβ4 can be added to or comprise a composition to<br>
effect Tp4 production from a tissue and/or a cell. Such agents include members of the<br>
family of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), platelet derived<br><br><br><br>
growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor beta<br>
(TGF-β), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), thymosin α1 (Tα1) and vascular<br>
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). More preferably, the agent is transforming growth<br>
factor beta (TGF-β) or other members of the TGF-β superfamily. Tβ4 compositions of<br>
 the invention may reduce certain effects of radiation by effectuating growth of the<br>
connective tissue through extracellular matrix deposition, cellular migration and<br>
vascularization.<br>
[0021] Additionally, other agents may be added to a composition along with Tp4 or a<br>
Tβ4 isoform. Such agents include angiogenic agents, growth factors, agents that direct<br>
 differentiation of cells, agents that promote migration of cells and agents that stimulate<br>
the provision of extracellular matrix material in tissue. For example, and not by way of<br>
limitation, Tβ4 or a Tβ4 isoform alone or in combination can be added in combination<br>
with any one or more of the following agents: VEGF, KGF, FGF, PDGF, TGFβ, IGF-1,<br>
IGF-2, IL-1, prothymosin a and thymosin α1 in an effective amount.<br>
 [0022] The actual dosage or reagent, formulation or composition that heals damage<br>
associated with radiation damage may depend on many factors, including the size and<br>
health of a subject. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art can use teachings<br>
describing the methods and techniques for determining clinical dosages as disclosed in<br>
PCT/US99/17282, supra, and the references cited therein, to determine the appropriate<br>
 dosage to use.<br>
[0023] Suitable formulations include the inventive composition at a concentration<br>
within the range of about 0.001 -10% by weight, more preferably within the range of<br>
about 0.005 - 0.1% by weight, most preferably about 0.01-0.05% by weight.<br>
[0024] The therapeutic approaches described herein involve various routes of<br>
 administration or delivery of reagents or compositions comprising the Tp4 or other<br>
compounds of the invention, including any conventional administration techniques (for<br>
example, but not limited to, topical administration, local injection, inhalation, systemic<br>
or enteral administration), to a subject. The methods and compositions using or<br>
containing Tβ4 or other compounds of the invention may be formulated into<br>
 pharmaceutical compositions by admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic<br>
excipients or carriers.<br>
[0025] The invention includes use of antibodies which interact with Tβ4 peptide or<br>
functional fragments thereof. Antibodies which include pooled monoclonal antibodies<br>
with different epitopic specificities, as well as distinct monoclonal antibody<br><br><br><br>
preparations are provided. Monoclonal antibodies are made from antigen containing<br>
fragments of the protein by methods well known to those skilled in the art as disclosed<br>
in PCT/US99/17282, supra. The term antibody as used in this invention is meant to<br>
include monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies.<br>
 [0026] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treatment or<br>
prevention of damage due to ionizing radiation exposure comprising administering to a<br>
subject in need of such treatment, an effective amount of a composition comprising a<br>
radiation damage-inhibiting polypeptide comprising amino acid sequence LKKTET, or a<br>
conservative variant thereof having radiation damage-inhibiting activity.<br>
 [0027] In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treatment or<br>
prevention of damage due to ionizing radiation exposure in a subject by contacting<br>
tissue with a radiation damage-inhibiting amount of a composition which contains Tβ4<br>
or a Tβ4 isoform. The contacting may be topically, enterally or systemically. Examples<br>
of topical administration include, for example, contacting skin or other tissue with a<br>
 lotion, salve, gel, cream, paste, spray, suspension, dispersion, hydrogel, ointment, or oil<br>
comprising Tβ4, alone or in combination with at least one agent that enhances Tβ4<br>
penetration, or delays or slows release of Tβ4 peptides into the area to be treated.<br>
Systemic administration includes, for example, intravenous, intraperitoneal,<br>
intramuscular or subcutaneous injections, or inhalation (orally or nasally), transdennal,<br>
 suppository, enema or oral administration of a composition containing Tβ4 or a Tβ4<br>
isoform, etc. A subject may be a mammal, preferably human.<br>
[0028] The invention provides a method for the prevention and/or healing and<br>
reversal of the body, bodily tissues, and organs and/or symptoms associated therewith,<br>
resulting from X-rays, gamma-rays or other forms of ionizing radiation and radiotherapy<br>
 of (i) cancer patients, (ii) patients receiving radiation or photo-therapy for skin or other<br>
disorders, or (iii) individuals exposed to acute or lethal doses of ionizing radiation, by<br>
the application of a therapeutically effective amount of a composition comprising Tβ4,<br>
Tβ4 analogues, isoforms, or peptide fragments with the amino acid sequence LKKTET<br>
and conservative variants thereof.<br>
 [0029] A method of the invention involves applying a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the composition to a site or systemically on a continuous or periodic basis<br>
during a course of therapy to reduce the effects of exposure to ionizing radiation. The<br>
duration of administration can range from a single administration to administration for<br>
the life of the subject. Preferred courses of administration are in a range of about 1-6<br>
 months. Administration can be periodic or continuous. During a course of<br><br><br><br>
administration, a composition in accordance with the invention may be administered<br>
once, twice, or three or more times per day, and can be administered daily, every other<br>
day, every third day, etc.<br>
[0030] According to one embodiment, radiation is administered to a target area of a<br>
 subject, and a composition in accordance with the invention is administered before,<br>
during and/or after administration of the radiation to the target area, so as to inhibit<br>
radiation damage in an area of said subject outside said target area.<br>
[0031] A method of the invention involves utilization of a composition which<br>
contains an agent that stimulates the production of LKKTET or Tβ4 or variants thereof<br>
 or some other actin-sequestering or anti-inflammatory compound.<br>
[0032] In one aspect of the method, the healing polypeptide is Tβ4 or an isoform or<br>
oxidized form of Tβ4, or a spliced-variant form of Tβ4 in a gel, cream, paste, lotion,<br>
spray, suspension, dispersion salve, hydrogel or ointment formulation.<br>
[0033] In another aspect of the method the composition may be delivered<br>
 systemically by injection, orally, nasally, transdermally or any other means.<br>
[0034] The composition may be naturally derived or produced using recombinant<br>
methodologies, or other synthetic means such as, but not limited to, solid-phase and<br>
solution-phase synthesis.<br>
[0035] One method includes treating exposure to ionizing radiation or other types of<br>
 radiation in a subject, comprising administering to the subject a composition containing<br>
an agent that regulates the actin-sequestering peptide, LKKTET, or Tβ4 activity. The<br>
