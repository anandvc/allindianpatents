BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a portable storage device, and in particular to a portable storage device having image and/or audio capture capabilities.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Portable data storage devices have become a class of indispensable peripherals that are widely utilized in business, educational, and home computing. These devices are generally not permanently fitted to a particular host platform, such as a personal computer (PC). Rather, they can be conveniently removed from and attached to any computer having the appropriate connection port (e.g. a serial bus port like a USB port or an IEEE 1394 ("Firewire") port). Thus, these portable data storage devices enable a user to transfer data among different computers that are not otherwise connected. A popular type of portable storage device utilizes a non-volatile solid-state memory (e.g. flash memory) as the storage medium and so does not require moving parts or a mechanical drive mechanism for accessing the data. The absence of a drive mechanism enables these portable solid-state memory devices to be more compact than surface storage devices such as magnetic disks and CD-ROMs.<br>
Portable devices such as digital cameras are known for acquiring images and processing/storing the images in a digital format. In general, devices such as digital cameras focus an image via a lens on the surface of an image-sensing device such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) or a MOS-type image-photographing element. The image-sensing device converts the optical image into electrical signals representative of the image. The electrical signals are then digitized through an A/D converter. Thereafter, the image may be processed to optimize visual aspects of the image and/or stored, typically on a flash memory card. A conventional digital camera is disclosed for example in U. S. Patent No. 6,208, 380 B1 to Misawa, discloses "A digital camera stores image data, which represent object images captured via a taking lens and a charge coupled device, in a built-in memory, which is provided in a camera body and which is able to store<br>
3<br><br>
image data of plural object images. When the built-in memory is filled with the image data, a memory card is inserted into a card slot so that the memory card connects to a card connector, and then the image data stored in the built-in memory are automatically transferred to the memory card. In this case, more than [1/3] of the memory card in the insertional direction is exposed, and hence the camera can be small-sized without being restricted by standards of the memory card."<br>
It is known to download images from a digital camera to a host platform such as a PC for further processing, viewing, printing, etc. However, many digital camera manufacturers use proprietary standards in the physical interface between the camera and host computer, and/or in the creation and storage of the image within the camera. In the event such proprietary standards are used, proprietary hardware and/or software are required on the host platform in order to download and process digital images from the camera to the host platform. For example, U. S. Patent No. 6,111, 604 to Hashimoto et al. discloses "An electronic camera and method of operating an electronic camera which detects whether an external device such as a personal computer is properly connected to the camera and in a state which permits communication. The camera monitors a data terminal ready (DTR) signal of an RS-232 connection in order to determine that the external device is properly connected and in a state, which permits communication. Once the proper connection is detected, the camera can either transmit or receive images and/or audio from the external device. Accordingly, a specific switch, which places the camera in a communication mode can be eliminated. Further, a single switch may be utilized for both controlling whether the camera records or plays images when there is no device connected, and which controls whether the camera transmits or receives images and/or audio when an external device is determined to be connected."<br>

Where the data comprises video image and audio data (explained below), the data may be compressed in accordance with the Movie Picture Experts Group (MPEG) file format.   The degree to which the Image data is compressed may be selected by the operator, for example, using an operator control panel 68 In digital camera module 50 as described below.   In one embodiment, the compressed data is sent via RAM 16 and then throucih USB device controller 15 to host platform 95.    In another embodiment, the compressed data is sent via RAM 16 and then through flash controller 14 to flash memory 20 for storage.<br>
Additionally, integrated circuit 10 Includes an optional error checking (ECC) engine 19 for performing various error checking tasks during the operation o"f portable device 70. It should be appreciated that ECC engine 19<br><br><br>
is well-sulled to numerous Implementations within the scope of the present Invention, For example, ECC engine 19 can be Implemented by software (e.g., firmware stored in a non-volatile memory), as part of microprocessor 11, pr as a pre cessor unit separate from microprocessor 11.<br>
The internal components of camera module 50 are of conventional design. In general, an image is focused on the surface of an image-sensing device 52 via an optical lens 54. Image-sensing device 52 may be a charge-coupled dovice (CCD) or a MOS-type image photographing element. It may alternatively be an Infrared (IR) or ultraviolet (UV) sensing device for camera embodiments Intended to capture Images beyond the visible light spectrum. The analocj raw Image data received from Image-sensing device 52 is passed to an analog processing circuit 56 which may include a CDS cramp circuit, a gain adjustment circuit, a color balance circuit and various other systems for performing known Image checking and enhancement functions. The output from analog processing circuit 56 is digitized by an A/D converter 58 and forwarded to a digital Image processing circuit 60 for processing as explained<br>
hereinafter.<br>
The CCD is driven by a CCD driver 62, which driver is synchronized with analog processing device 56 and A/D converter 58 by a timing signal generated by a timing generator 64 in a known manner. Timing generator 64 Is controlled by a camera microprocessor 66. Camera module 50 may further Include an operator control panel 68 for allowing a camera operator to manually s elect between various modes and functions of the camera module. including lor example Image resolution, image magnification, still frame or continuous!   video,   etc.      Operator-selected   modes   and   functions   are<br><br>
communicated from control panel 68 to camera microprocessor 66. Information from microprocessor 66 is also communicated to control panel 68 for display to the operator over an LCD (not shown) on panel 68, such as the amount of available space In memory and battery charge status. Microprocessor 66 also performs monitoring functions which are communicated to operator control panel 68. For example, in the case of an error in ths operation of any of the above-described camera module components;, microprocessor 66 can cause an error message to be displayed on the LCD of panel 66. Operator control panel 68 may also Include an image capture button (not shown) for activating the Image capture operation described above.<br>
