				<td>The present invention relates to reproducing apparatus for recording data from recordable disc and/or a replay -only disc.<br>
This invention relates to a disc recording/reproducing apparatus adapted to implement bit compression processing to successively inputted data caused to be in a digital form to record/reproduce them through a disc.<br>
This application is a divisional out of Indian Patent Application No. 849/Del/92 filed September 22, 1992 now Patent No. 185,888.<br>
Description of the Prior Art<br>
Optical discs can have a recording capacity greater than that of magnetic discs by of 2-3 figures or digits, and can make a higher speed access than that in a recording medium in a tape form. Further, such optical discs can carry out recording/reproduction of data in a manner to be not in contact with a medium, thus advantageously providing an excellent durability. For these reasons, optical discs have been frequently used in recent years. For such optical disc, so called CDs (Compact Discs) are most popularly known.<br>
Meanwhile, in the case of attempting to provide, by using an optical disc, a portable recording/reproducing equipment, particularly a head phone stereo equipment of about so-called a<br><br>
pocket size, or a recording and/or reproducing apparatus similar thereto, in existing CDs as described above, for example, there are standardized formats for a CD of a disk diameter of 12 cm and a CD of a disk diameter of 8 cm (so called a CD single type). However, in the case of the disk having a diameter of 12 cm, the outside dimension of the recording/reproducing apparatus becomes too large, resulting in poor portability. For this reason, it is conceivable to use a disk having a diameter of 8 cm or less. However, in the case of attempting to constitute a portable recording and/or reproducing apparatus or an apparatus of about a pocket size by using an optical disk having a diameter of about 8 cm or less, there are the following problems.<br>
First, in a standard CD format (CD-DA format) such that optical disks, on whigh stereo digital PCM audio signals having a sampling frequency of 44.1 KHz and subjected to 16 bit quantization are recorded, are supplied from the maker side, and only reproduction or playback is conducted on the user side, the reproduction or playback time (recording time) of the disk having a diameter of 8 cm is a short value of about 20 to 22 minutes even at the maximum, so it would be unable to entirely record a symphony of a classic music. For the reproduction or playback time, about 74 minutes or more at the maximum the same order as that of the 12 cm CD presently available is expected. Further, in the CD-DA format, recording cannot be carried out on the user side. In addition, a non-contact optical pick-up device is<br><br>
easily affected by mechanical vibration, etc., so deviation in tracking and/or defocusing (deviation infocusing), etc. are apt to occur by vibration, etc. For this reason, in the case of carrying such equipment, any very effective measure for suppressing bad influence on the reproducing operation due to deviation in tracking or defocusing, etc. is required.<br>
Further, in a CD-MO format (format using a recordable magneto-optical disk) as an extended format of the standard CD format (CD-DA format), the recording/reproducing time of a disk having a diameter of 8 cm is disadvantageously a short time of about 20 to 22 minutes the same as that of the CD-DA format. In addition, the deviation in tracking and/or defocusing of an optical pick-up device resulting from mechanical vibration, etc. are apt to occur. Fo,r this reason, any measure for preventing bad influence on the recording/reproducing operation resulting therefrom is required.<br>
In a CD-I (CD-interactive) format, as a mode for recording/reproducing a bit-compressed digital audio signal, respective levels as shown in the following Table are standardi zed.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
In this Table 1, when a disk recorded, e.g. in the B level mode is reproduced, a signal obtained by bit-compressing a digital signal of the standard CD-DA format so that its signal density becomes equal to an approximately quadruple value (a value about four times grater than that of the original signal) is reproduced. Accordingly, for example, when all recording data are stereo audio compressed data, reproduction of a time four times (four channels) greater than the standard time can be carried out. As a result, even with an optical disk having a diameter of about 8 cm or less, recording/reproduction of about 70 minutes can be carried out.<br>
Meanwhile, in the above-mentioned CD-I format, because a disk is rotationally driven at the same linear velocity as that of the standard CD-DA format, successive audio compressed data will be reproduced at a rate of 1/n recording units on the disk.<br>
This unit is called a block or sector. One block (sector) is comprised of 98 frames, and the period is 1/75 seconds. In this instance, n is the above-mentioned reproduction or playback time or a numeric value corresponding to bit compression ratio of data. For example, in the B level stereo mode, n is equal to 4. Accordingly, in the B level stereo mode, a data train in which ones of respective four sectors are respectively caused to serve as an audio sector as indicated below:<br>
SDDDSDDD -••<br>
(S is an audio sector, and D is any other data<br>
sector)<br>
are recorded on a disk. It is to be noted that since, at the time of an actual recording, a predetermined encode processing (error correction codi.ng processing and interleaving processing) similar to that for audio data of an ordinary CD format is implemented to the above-mentioned data train, data of the audio sector S and data of the data sector D are arranged in __ a distributed manner in recording sectors on the disk. Here, e.g., video data or computer data, etc. is used as any other data sector D mentioned above. In the case where bit-compressed audio signals are used also for the data sector D, data train [S1 , 52, S3, S4, S1, S2, S3, S4 •••] in which audio sectors SI ~ S4 of four channels are cyclically arranged in a successive manner will be subjected to encode processing and are recorded on the disk.<br>
In the  case  of recording/reproducing successive audio<br>
signals, the above-mentioned audio signals of four channels such that they are connected in a successive manner from the first channel to the fourth channel are used. At this time, by reproducing data of the first channel corresponding to the audio sector SI from the disk innermost circumference up to the outermost circumference thereafter to return to the disk innermost circumference for a second time to reproduce in turn data of the second channel corresponding to the audio sector S2 up to the outermost circumference to reproduce data of the third channel corresponding to the next audio sector S3 from the disk innermost circumference to the outermost circumference for a second time to finally reproduce data of the fourth channel corresponding to the remaining audio sector S4 from the disk innermost circumference up to the outer circumference for a second time, continuous reproduction of a quadruple time will be carried out.<br>
.... ._: However, in a continuous reproduction as described above, several times of track jump operations of a long distance returning from the outermost circumference to the inner circumference are required. Since such track jump operations cannot be momentarily carried out, there is the serious problem that reproduced data for that time is lost, so a reproduced sound is interrupted. Further, in order to attempt to record successive audio signals, it is impossible to record, e.g., a signal of the sector S2 alone by the relation of the interleaving<br>
processing at the time of recording. For this reason, interleaving processing of data of adjacent sectors SI and S3, or interleaving processing of data of the peripheral sectors in addition thereto is required. As a result, it is necessary to rewrite signals in sectors already recorded. Accordingly, recording of such successive compressed audio data is very difficult.<br>
OBJECTS &amp; SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
With such actual circumstances in view, this invention has been made and its object is to permit recordi ng/reproducti on of recording data having a data structure in which an extremely long convoluted interleaving processing is implemented.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Fig. 1 is a circuit diagram showing,	in a block form, the<br>
outline   of   the   configuration   of	an   optical   disk<br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according	to an embodiment of<br>
this invention.<br>
In the optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus shown in Fig. 1, a magneto-optical disk having a recording/reproducing area where data can be recorded and reproduced, an optical disk for reproduction or playback only having a reproduction or playback only area for recording data, and a magneto-optical disk having both a recording/reproducing area where data can be recorded and reproduced and a playback only area for recording data may be used as a recording medium. These disks are adapted so that they are rotationally driven by a spindle motor 1. In this example, a magneto-optical disk 2 having a playback only area AIO and a recordi ng/reproduci ng area A20 provided outside the playback only area A1Q is adapted so that it is rotationally driven by the spindle.motor 1.<br>
The playback only area A1Q of the magneto-optical disk 2 includes a data area A^ where data such as playing information, —circumferential side thereof. In this lead-ion area A12, TOC (Table of Contents) data indicating the recording position or recording content of the data area A^ is recorded. In this playback only area A10, digital data are recorded in advance as presence and absence of pits corresponding to "1" and "Ov.<br>
Further, the recording/reproducing area A2Q of the magneto-optical disk 2 includes a data area A21 where data such as playing information, etc. is recorded, and a lead-in area provided on the Inner circumferential side thereof. In this lead-in area A22, TOC data indicating the recording position or the recording content of the data area k^ "•s recorded. This recording/reproducing area A20 serves as a magneto-optical recording medium area.<br>
The optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus of this embodiment applies a modulated magnetic field to the magneto-optical disk 2 rotated by the spindle motor 1 with a laser beam being irradiated thereto by means of an optical head 3, for example, to thereby carry out recording (so-called a magnetic modulation recording) of data along recording tracks of the recordi ng/reproduci ng area A20 of the magneto-optical disk 2, and to trace, by a laser beam, recording tracks of the playback only area A10 and the recording/reproducing area A20 of the magneto-optical disk 2 by means of the optical head 3 to thereby optically reproduce data.<br>
The optical head 3 is comprised, as shown in Fig. 3, for example, of a laser light source 31 such as a laser diode, etc., optical components such as a collimator lens 32, a beam splitter 33, an object lens 34, and a polarized beam splitter 35, etc. , first and second photodetectors 36, 37 for detecting a light separated by the polarized beam splitter 35, a first signal synthesis elements for performing additive synthesis of respective detection outputs by these photodetectors 36, 37, a second signal synthesis element 39 for performing a subtractive<br>
synthesis of respective detection outputs, and the like. This optical head 3 is provided at the position opposite to a magnetic head 4 with the magneto-optical disk 2 being put therebetween. In the case of recording data into the recording/reproducing area A20 of the magneto-optical disk 2, this optical head 3 irradiate a laser beam onto a target track of the magneto-optical disk 2 to which a modulated magnetic field corresponding to recording data is applied resulting from the fact that the magnetic head 4 is driven by a head driving circuit 16 of a recording system which will be described later to thereby carry out data recording by thermomagnetic recording. This optical head 3 also detects a reflected light of a laser beam irradiated onto the target track to thereby detect a focus error, e.g., by the so-called astigmatism method, and to detect a tracking error, e.g., by the so-called push-pull method. Further, when data is reproduced from the playback only area A-|Q of the magneto-optical disk 2, this optical head 3 detects a change in a light quantity of a reflected light from a target track of the laser beam, thereby making it possible to provide a reproduced signal. Thus, such a reproduced signal obtained by carrying out additive synthesis of respective detection outputs by the photodetectors 36, 37 by using the first signal synthesis element 38 is outputted through a changeover switch 40. Further, when data is reproduced from the recording/reproducing area A20 of the magneto-optical disk 2, this optical head 3 detects a difference in the polarization<br>
angles (Kerr rotational angles) of a reflected light from a target track of a laser beam, thereby making it possible to provide a reproduced signal. Thus, such a reproduced signal obtained by applying subtractive synthesis of respective detection outputs by the photodetectors 36, 37 by using the second signal synthesis element 39 is outputted through the changeover switch 40. Here, the above-mentioned changeover switch 40.is adapted so that switching control corresponding to respective operational modes is conducted by a system controller 7 which will be described later.<br>
An output of the optical head 3 is delivered to a RF circuit 5 as shown in Fig. 1. This RF circuit 5 extracts a focus error signal or a tracking error signal from an output of the optical head 3 to deliver it tp a servo control circuit 6, and to binary-code the reproduced signal to deliver a decoder 21 of a reproducing system which will be described later.<br>

control circuit, a tracking servo control circuit, a spindle motor servo control circuit, and a sled servo control circuit, etc. The focus servo control circuit carries out a focus control of the optical system of the optical head 3 so that the focus error signal becomes equal to zero. Moreover, the tracking servo control circuit carries out a tracking control of the optical system of the optical head 3 so that the tracking error signal becomes equal to zero. Further, the spindle motor servo control<br>
circuit controls the spindle motor 1 so that the magneto-optical disk 2 is rotationally driven at a predetermined rotational velocity (e.g., constant linear velocity). In addition, the sled servo control circuit moves the optical head 3 and the magnetic head 4 to a target track position of the magneto-optical disk 2 designated by the system controller 7. The servo control circuit 6 adapted for carrying out various control operations delivers, to the system controller 7, information indicating operating states of respective components controlled by the servo control ci rcui t 6.<br>
To the system controller 7, a key input operation unit 8 and a display unit 9 are connected. This system controller 7 carries out control of the recording system and the reproducing system i n an operational mode, designated by operation input i nf orr.aci on by the key input operation unit 8. Further, this system controller 7 controls the recording position or the reproducing  magnetic head 4 trace, on the basis of address information every sector reproduced from the recording track of the magneto-optical disk 2.<br>
The recording system of the optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus includes an A/D converter supplied with an analog audio signal AIN through a low-pass filter 11 from an input terminal 10. The A/D converter 12 quantizes the audio signal AIN to form digital audio data of a<br>
data rate of 2 ch. x 16 bits x 44.1 KHz = 1.4 M bits/s. The digital audio data obtained from the A/D converter 12 is delivered to an ATRAC (Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding) encoder 13.<br>
This ATRAC encoder 13 analyzes 1.4 M bit/s data rate digital audio data obtained by quantizing the audio signal A™ by using the A/D converter 12 so that a waveform on the time base is divided into about 1,000 components on the frequency base by the so-called orthogonal-transform processing with data of about 20 ms at the maximum being as one block to extract those components in order from frequency components considered to be important from a viewpoint of hearing sense to generate about 300K bits/s digital audio data. Namely, there is carried out a processing to compress the 1.4 M,b-&gt;t/s data rate digital audio data to 3OO K bit/s data rate digital audio data which is about one fifth thereof. Thus, the transfer rate of data is converted from 75<br>
seetors/s^c.- to -about—15—sectors/sec.—in—tne standard <br>
fo rmat.<br>
Data write and readout in the memory 14 are controlled by the system controller 7. This memory 14 is used as a buffer memory for temporarily storing compressed audio data delivered from the ATRAC encoder 13 to record it onto the disk according to need. Namely, the data transfer rate of compressed audio data delivered from the ATRAC encoder 13 is reduced to one fifth of the data transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec., i.e., 15 sectors/sec.<br>
and such compressed data are successively written into the memory 14. Such compressed data can be provided if recording of one of five sectors is carried out. Since such recording every fifth sector is virtually impossible, recording successive in sector as described later is carried out. This recording is carried out in a burst at a data transfer rate of 75 seconds/sec, with a cluster comprised of a predetermined plural number of sectors (.e.g., 32 sectors + several sectors) through idle periods. Namely, in the memory 14, compressed audio data successively written at a low transfer rate of 15 (= 75/5) sectors/sec, corresponding to the bit compression rate is read out in a burst at the transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, as recording data. With respect to data read out and recorded, the entire data transfer rate including the recording idle periods is a low rate of 15 sectors/sec., but momentary data transfer rate within a time of the recording operation carried out in a<br>
-b-u-FSt H-S-—7-5 -sect o-rs/s-ec-;	<br>
Compressed audio data, i.e., recording data read out in a burst at the transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, from the memory 14 is delivered to the encoder 15. Here, in the data train delivered from the memory 14 to the encoder 15, a unit in which data are successively recorded by a single recording is caused to be a cluster comprised of plural sectors (e.g., 32 sectors) and several sectors for connection of cluster arranged before and after the cluster mentioned above. This cluster connection<br><br>
sector has a length set so that it is longer than an interleaving length at the encoder 15. Even if interleaving processing is carried out, such cluster connection sectors have no influence on data of adjacent clusters.<br>
Namely, recording data (data read out from the memory 14) in this optical disk recordi ng/reproduci ng apparatus is in a form such that recording data is divided into clusters every a fixed number of. sectors (or blocks), and that several sectors for connection of cluster are arranged between these clusters. In actual terms, as shown in Fig. 4, a cluster C is comprised of 36 sectors in total of 32 sectors (blocks) BO - B31, a single subcode sector S, and three connection (linking) sectors LI - L3, and Is joined with adjacent clusters through the linking sectors LI ~ L3. Here, in the cas.e of recording one cluster, e.g., the K-th cluster CK, recording is carried out with 36 sectors including not only 32 sectors BO - 831 of the cluster CK and a<br>
single sub-cod_e_...se_ct_P_r.__S_.__but_._also two	se-C-to-rs	L2,—L3 ^&gt;n—the	<br>
cluster C^_1 side (run-in block) and a single sector LT on the cluster CK+1 side (run-out block) being as a unit. At this time, recording data of 36 sectors is sent from the memory 14 to the encoder 15. As the result of the fact that the interleaving processing is carried out at this encoder 15, sequencing of a distance of 108 frames (corresponding to 1.1 sectors) at the maximum is carried out. With respect to data within the cluster CK, those data sufficiently fal1 within the range from the run-in<br><br>
block L2, L3 up to the run-out block LI, and have therefore no influence on other clusters CK_^ on C^. It is to be noted that, in the linking sectors L1 ~ L3, dummy data, e.g., 0, etc. are arranged. Thus, bad influence on original data by the interleaving processing can be avoided.<br>
By carrying out such a recording every cluster, it has been unnecessary to take into consideration interference by the interleaving processing with other clusters. As a result, the data processing can be simplified to much degree. Further, in the case where recording data fails to be normally recorded at the time of recording by defocusing, tracking deviation, other erroneous operations, or the like, re-recording can be carried out every cluster. In addition, in the case where effective data reading fails to be carried out at the time of reproduction, re-reading can be carried out every cluster.<br>
The encoder  15  implements  coding processing for error correction (addition of parity and interleaving processing) or<br>
EFM coding processing, etc. to recording data delivered in a burst as described above from the memory 14. The recording data to which coding processing has been implemented by the encoder 15 is delivered to the magnetic head driving circuit 16. This magnetic head driving circuit 16, to which the magnetic head 4 is connected, drives the magnetic head 4 so as to apply a modulated magnetic field corresponding to the recording data to the magneto-optical disk 2.<br><br>
Further, the system controller 7 carries out a memory control as described above with respect to the memory 14, and carries out control of the recording position so as to<br>
successively record the recording data read out in a burst from<br>
.•..-&amp;&amp;<br>
the memory 14 by the memory control onto recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2. The control of the recording position is carried out by controlling, by using the system controller 7, the recording position of the recording data read out in a burst from the memory 14 to deliver a control signal for designating the recording position on the recording track of the magneto-optical disk 2 to the servo control circuit 6.<br>
Namely, in this optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus, digital data obtained from the A/D converter 12 is audio PCM data having a sampling frequency of 44.1 KHz, a quantization bit number of 16 bits, and a data transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, as described above. This audio PCM data is sent to the ATRAC encoder 13. As a result, compressed audio data having a data transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec, which is one fifth of the audio PCM data is outputted. Thus, compressed audio data successively outputted at a transfer speed of 15 sectors/sec, is delivered from the ATRAC encoder 13 to the memory 14.<br>
The system controller 7 successively increments, as shown in Fig. 5, a write pointer W of the memory 14 at a transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec, to thereby successively write the compressed audio data into the memory 14 at a transfer rate of 15<br><br>
sectors/sec. When the data quantity of the compressed audio data stored in the memory 14 exceeds a predetermined quantity K, the system controller 7 carries out a memory control so as to increment in a burst a read pointer R of the memory 14 at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, to read out, from the memory 14, the compressed audio data as recording data at the transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, by the predetermined quantity K.<br>
By such memory control by the system controller 7, compressed audio data successive!y outputted, e.g., at a transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec, from the ATRAC encoder 13 is written into the memory 14 at the transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec. When the data quantity of the compressed audio data stored in the memory 14 exceeds the predetermined quantity K, the compressed audio data is read out from .the memory 14 in a burst at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, by the predetermined quantity K as recording data. Accordingly, it is possible to successively write inputted data into the memory 14 while ensuring a data write area having<br>
a capacity of more than a predetermined quantity in the memory 14 at all times.<br>
The recording data which are read out in a burst from the memory 14 in a successive manner on recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2 by controlling the recording position on recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2 by using the system controller 7. As mentioned above, data write area having a capacity of more than a predetermined quantity is always<br><br>
ensured in the memory 14. Accordingly, if the operation of ecording on the magneto-optical disk 2 is interrupted by the occurrence of a track jump or other incident due to a disturbance which is detected by the system controller 7, a recovery operation can be carried out while inputted data continue to be written into the data write area having a capacity of more than a predetermined quantity, and the inputted data can be recorded on the recording track of the magneto-optical disk 2 in a successive manner.<br>
It is to be noted that header time data corresponding to a physical address of the sector are added to the compressed audio data every sector and recorded on the magneto-optical disk 2. In addition, Tabl e-of-contents data indicating the recording area or the recording contents are recorded in a Table-of-contents area.<br>
When attention is now drawn to recording data recorded as<br>
presence or absence of	pjrts in the playback only area A^Q jof_t_he	<br>
magneto-optical disk 2, it is seen that one cluster C is comprised of 36 sectors in total of 32 sectors (blocks) BO ~ B31 and four sub-data sectors S1 ~ S4, as shown in Fig. 6, with connection sectors LI ~ L3 for recording data in the above-described recording/reproducing area A2Q shown in Fig. 4 being as a sub-data sector S. Since there is no possibility that recording data in the playback only area A1Q is rewritten, it is possible to use the connection sectors L1 - L3 as sub-data sector<br><br>
S. By providing four sub-data sectors SI - S4 every cluster in the playback only area A^ in this way, it is possible to record, into the sub-data sectors S1 - S4, addition data of a quantity four times greater than that of addition data recorded in the sub-data sector S of the recording/reproducing area A20.<br>
The reproducing system in this optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus will now be described.<br>
This.reproducing system serves to reproduce recording data which have been successively recorded on the recording tracks of the playback only area A1Q and the recording/reproducing area A20 of the magneto-optical disk 2, and includes a decoder 21 supplied with a reproduced output obtained by tracing recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2 by a laser beam from the optical head 3, i.e., a reproduced signal of the playback only area A1fl outputted through the changeover switch 40 from the first signal synthesis element 38, or a reproduced signal of the<br>
	recordi ng / r ejir_ojju c 'ing.__a_re.a^Wjg -Q-Ut putt e d . t h _r pjjgjx. t_h e.. _c _ha_n_g e_o v e_ r_<br>
switch 40 from the second signal synthesis element 39 under the state where the reproduced output, i.e., the reproduced signal of the region A1Q or the recordi ng/reproduci ng area A20 is binary-cc Jed by the RF circuit 5.<br>
The above-mentioned decoder 21 corresponds to the encoder 15 in the above-described recording system, and carries out processing such as decoding processing or EFM decoding processing as described above for error correction, etc. with respect to<br><br>
reproduced output binary-coded by the RF circuit 5 to reproduce the above-described compressed audio data at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec. The reproduced data obtained by the decoder 21 is delivered to the memory 22. The data write/read operations of the memory 22 are controlled by the system controller 7. Thus, reproduced data delivered at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, from the decoder 21 is written into the memory 22 in a burst at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec. Further, from the memory 22, the reproduced data written in a burst at the transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, is read out in a successive manner at a transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec.<br>
The system controller 7 carries out such a memory control to write the reproduced data into the memory 22 at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/seg. , and to read out in a successive manner the reproduced data from the memory 22 at the transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec.<br>
Further, the system controller 7	c^r^ies °_u"t_a memory<br>
control as described above with respect to the memory 22, and carries out control of the reproducing position so as to successively reproduce, from the recording track of the magneto-optical disk 2, the reproduced data written in a burst from the memory 22 by this memory control. The control of the reproducing position is carried out by controlling, by using the system controller 7, the reproducing position of the reproduced data read out in a burst from the memory 22 to deliver a control<br><br>
signal for designating the reproducing position on the recording "crack of the magneto-optical disk 2 to the servo control circuit 6.<br>
Namely, the system controller 7 carries out a memory control, as shown in Fig. 7, to increment a write pointer W of the memory 22 at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, to write the reproduced data into the memory 22 at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec., and to successively increment the read pointer R of the memory 22 at a transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec, to successively read out the reproduced data from the memory 22 at a transfer rate of 15 sectors/sec, to stop the write operation when the write pointer W catches up with the read pointer R to increment in a burst the write pointer W of the memory 22 at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec, so as to carry out a write operation when the data quantity of the reproduced data stored in the memory 22 is below a predetermined quantity L.<br>
By srcrcrh—memory—contrrol	by thve—sy-s-t-etn—-e orrt-r-e-1-1-e-r	7-,-	<br>
compressed audio data reproduced from recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2 is written into the memory 22 in a burst at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec., and the compressed audio data is successively read out from the memory 14 as reproduced data at a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec. Accordingly, while ensuring a data readout area having a capacity of more than a predetermined quantity L at all times in the memory 22, reproduced data can be successively read out from the memory 22.<br><br>
Further, the reproduced data read out in a burst from the memory 22 can be reproduced in a successive manner from the recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2 by controlling the reproducing position on the recording tracks of the magneto-optical disk 2 by using the system controller 7. In addition, since a data readout area having a capacity of more than a predetermined quantity L is ensured at all times in the memory 22 .as described above, even in the case where the system controller 7 detects that a track jump, etc. takes place by disturbance, etc. to interrupt the reproducing operation with respect to the magneto-optical disk 2, it is possible to read out reproduced data from the data readout area having a capacity of more than a predetermined quantity L to successively provide an output of analog audio signals. Thus, a recovery processing operation can be carried out during that time period.<br>
The compressed audio data obtained as  reproduced data successively read out from the memory 22 at a transfer rate of<br>
15 sectors/sec, is delivered to an ATRAC decoder 23. This ATRAC decoder 23 corresponds to the ATRAC encoder 13 of the recording system. When an operational mode is designated by the system controller 7, the ATRAC decoder 23 in this optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus reproduces digital audio data having a transfer rate of 75 sectors/sec. by expanding the compressed audio data to five times. The digital audio data thus obtained is delivered from the ATRAC decoder 23 to a D/A<br><br>
converter 24.<br>
The D/A converter 24 converts digital audio data delivered from the ATRAC decoder 23 to data in an analog form to form an analog audio signal Agy-j-. The analog audio signal A^j obtained by the D/A converter 24 is outputted from an output terminal 26 through a low-pass filter 25.<br>
It is to be noted that the reproducing system of the optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus of this embodiment has also a digital output function. By the ATRAC encoder 23, digital audio data is outputted from a digital output terminal 26 as a digital audio signal DQUj through a digital output encoder 27.<br>
As stated above, in the optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus of this embodiment, recording data obtained by implementing, by using the ATRAC encoder 13, data compression to digital audio data obtained by digitizing, by using the A/D converter 12, analog audio signals AjN, i.e., successive signals is divided into c1 usjte rjs every _a_ fixed number of sec_tp_r_s_&gt; and cluster connection sectors L1 - L3 longer than an interleaving length in the interleaving processing are provided at connection portions of respective clusters C, thus to implement interleaving processing thereto to record the data thus processed into the recording/reproducing area A20 of the magneto-optical disk 2 every cluster, and to reproduce recorded data from the recording/reproducing area A20. Since recording data is separated every cluster by providing the cluster connection<br><br>
sectors LI - L3 as described above, record!ng/reproduction of -ecording data having a data structure in which an extremely long convoluted interleaving processing is implemented can be carried out.<br>
Further, from the playback only area A1Q where recording data is recorded in accordance with the same data format as that of the recordi ng/reproduci ng area A20, and addition data are recorded i.n four sub-code sectors S1 ~ S4 which correspond to the cluster connection sectors LI ~ L3, recorded data and addition data are reproduced. Then, time-base expansion processing is implemented to reproduced data from the recording/reproducing means or the reproducing or playback means by using the reproduced data memory means. Thus, the recording area for addition data where recording data of the same data structure as that of the recording/reproducing area A2Q are recorded is ensured in the playback only area AIQ , thus making it possible to reproduce addition' data along with the recorded data.<br>
Here, in the optical disk recording/reproducing apparatus of this embodiment, magneto-optical disk 2 including both the playback only area A^ and the recordi ng/reproduci ng area A20 is used as a recording medium. However, there may be used a magneto-optical disk as a recording medium, in which the entire area is caused to be the recordi ng/reproduci ng area A20 without provision of the playback only area A1Q to record, into the recordi ng/reproduci ng area AOQ , recording data of the<br><br>
above-described data structure shown in Fig. 4 provided with cluster connection sectors longer than an interleaving length in the interleaving processing provided at connection portions of respective clusters of recording data divided into clusters every a fixed number of sectors, and to reproduce the recorded data from the recording/reproducing area A20.<br>
Further, there may be used a reproduction or playback only disk as a.recording medium, in which the entire area is caused to be the playback only area A^ without provision of the recording/reproducing area A20, and recording data of the above-described data structure shown in Fig. 6 are recorded on the entire surface, thus to reproduce recorded data of the playback only area A1Q. In the playback only optical disk, cluster connection se.ctors provided at connection portions of respective clusters of recording data divided into clusters every a fixed number of sectors may be used as sub-data sector to record in advance addition data thereinto, thereby making it possible to increase the quantity of addition data. Thus, a playback only disk having a recording area for addition data broader than that of the magneto-optical disk, i.e., the recording/reproducing disk can be provided.<br>
It is to be noted various data such as still picture data, character data or speech data, etc. are conceivable as the addition data.<br>
As is clear from the foregoing description, in the disk<br><br>
recording/reproducing apparatus according to this invention, recording data obtained by implementing time base compression processing to successively, inputted data caused to be in a digital form by using memory means is divided into clusters every a fixed number of sectors to provide cluster connection sectors longer than an interleaving length in the interleaving processing at connection portions of respective clusters to implement interleaving processing to recording data to record the interleaved data into the recordi ng/reproduci ng area every cluster, and to reproduce recorded data from the recording/reproducing area. As stated above, since recording data is separated every cluster by providing the cluster connection sectors, it is possible to carry out recording/reproduction of recording data having .a data structure in which an extremely long convoluted interleaving processing is implemented. Further, the reproducing means reproduces recorded data and addition data from a-p^-a-yback-on-l^y—area-whe re -recordi ng -data—i s—rettrrd-exi ~by~ttre-same-data format as that of the recordi ng/reproduc i ng area are recorded, and addition data are recorded in sectors corresponding to the cluster' connection sectors. Then, time-base expansion processing is implemented to reproduced data from the recording/reproducing means or the reproducing or playback means by using the reproduced data memory means. Thus, a recording region for addition data is ensured in the playback only area or playback only disk where recording data of the same data<br><br>
structure as that of the recording/reproducing area are recorded, thus making it possible to reproduce addition data along with recording data.<br>
Accordingly, in accordance with this invention, there can be provided a disk recording/reproducing apparatus in which recording/reproduction of recording data having a data structure where an extremely long convoluted interleaving processing is implemented can be carried out, and a recording area for addition data is ensured in a playback only area or a playback only disk where recording data of the same data structure as that of the recording data are recorded, thus making it possible to reproduce addition data together with recorded data.<br>
Further, in the playback only disk according to this invention, since addition data are recorded in cluster connection sectors longer than the interleaving length in the interleaving processing provided at connection portions of respective clusters of recording data divided into clusters every a fixed number of sectors, the quantity of addition data can be increased. Accordingly, in accordance with this invention, there can be provided a playback only disk having a recording area for addition data broader than that of the recording/reproducing disk.<br>
In addition, in the disk according to this invention, recording data is divided into clusters every a fixed number of sectors, and cluster connection sectors longer than the<br><br>
interleaving length in the interleaving processing are provided at connection portions of respective clusters. Accordingly, it is possible to carry out recording/reproduction of data to which the interleaving processing is implemented every cluster through the recording/reproducing area. Further, from the playback only area, recording data of the same data format as that of the recording/reproducing area can be reproduced together with addition data. Accordingly, in accordance with this invention, there can be provided a disk including a recording/reproducing area where recording/reproduction of recording data of a data structure in which an extremely long convoluted interleaving processing is implemented is carried out, and a recording area where recording data of the same data structure as that of the recording/reproducing, region are recorded along with addition data.<br><br>
