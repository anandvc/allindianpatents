				<td>This Invention relates to an improved valve winding of a converter transformer.<br>
BACKGROUND Of THE INVENTION.<br>
In most of the filed converter transformers, it has been found that a shining layer<br>
is formed between copper conductor and first layer of paper insulation in the<br>
valve winding. This compound is conducting in nature and doubts have been<br>
expressed that it may deteriorate the insulation strength of the covered paper<br>
insulation. Such conducting material is likely to lead to partial discharges<br>
between strands of copper-paper Insulation system and eventually an internal<br>
fault.<br>
The formation of conducting layer Is due to chemical reaction between<br>
sulphides/mercaptans present in transformer oil &amp; copper, which produces<br>
copper sulphide &amp; thereby deteriorating the insulation properties of paper<br>
insulation. Such deterioration eventually leads to the Insulation failure.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
An object of this invention is to propose en improved veto winding of a convenor<br>
transformer.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved valve winding of a<br>
converter transformer having a protective layer of enamel Insulation.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose an Improved valve winding of a<br>
convenor transformer having no chemical reaction between the<br>
sulphides/mercaptans present in transformer oil and copper.<br>
Still further object of this Invention is to propose en Improved valve winding of a<br>
converior transformer having proper insulation properties.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention, there is provided an improved valve winding of a<br>
converter transformer comprising a protective coating disposed between the<br>
copper conductor and a first layer of paper insulation of the valve winding to<br>
protect the valve winding from insulation failure due to formation of a conductive<br>
layer, the conductive layer being formed by the chemical reaction between the<br>
copper conductor and the transformer oil.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig-1 New concept applied on normal PICC<br>
Fig-2 New concept applied on glued bunch PICC<br>
Fig-3 EDAX Analysis of copper conductor from Rihand<br>
Fig-4 EDAX Analysis of Chandrapur copper conductor<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the new design, direct contact between winding copper (especially valve<br>
windings) and transformer oil is avoided thereby eliminating the chance of<br>
formation of conducting layer due to chemical reaction between conductor and<br>
transformer oil. In this design, a protective layer of enamel insulation is used<br>
over all the valve winding copper to prevent the direct chemical reaction<br>
between copper &amp; sulphides/mercaptans present in transformer oil.<br>
Usually for valve windings, Paper insulated copper conductor (PICC) (1) or Glued<br>
Bunched PICC (4) are used. Conventionally both these type of conductors<br>
without enamel (3) were being used since last many years for all applications as<br>
per Fig la &amp; 2a. Paper (2) used to be the insulating material for these type of<br>
conductors. However the new invention makes the use of protective layer of<br>
enamel (3) as a mandatory requirement over bare copper as per Figure 1b &amp; 2b<br>
to prevent the direct chemical reaction between copper (1) &amp;<br>
sulphides/mercaptans present in transformer oil.<br>
The thickness of protective layer of enamel used in valve winding depends on<br>
the type of winding. The protective layer of enamel used in valve winding<br>
comprises of Polyvinyl acetal enamel class 120 of IEC 317-18-1990.<br><br>
Published information regarding detailed analysis carried out on refined<br>
transformer oil samples indicates that there are different types of sulphur<br>
compounds present. Some of them are corrosive or reactive. Further analysis<br>
reveals that five basic groups of sulphur and sulphur compounds are found in<br>
crude oil as indicated below:<br><br>
R- Paraffin with straight or branched chain hydrocarbon or cyclic hydrocarbon.<br>
As shown in table above, the elemental sulphur and sulphur containing<br>
mercaptans are very reactive, sulphides are also reactive. Reactive sulphur is<br>
mainly in form of organic sulphur compounds like R-SH, where the sulphur is<br>
attached at the end of an organic molecule. When the molecule is more complex,<br>
for instance when the sulphur is surrounded or contained within the molecule<br>
then the sulphur compounds are more stable and less reactive like in R-S.S-R.<br>
Thiophenes are the most stable of all the sulphur compounds.<br>
It has been found that deterioration in insulation properties is due to reaction of<br>
mercaptan sulphur and elemental sulphur with exposed copper surface of<br>
conductor leading to formation of conducting layer of copper sulphides and other<br>
compounds.<br>
Probable Phenomena of Failure<br>
The reactive sulphur, once in contact with copper surface, starts reacting with it,<br>
forming copper sulphide even at operating temperature. The rate of reaction<br>
increases with temperature. The reaction is likely to be faster in hot spot region<br>
of the winding and ducts. It is likely that presence of voltage could accelerate the<br>
formation of copper sulphide. However no experimental evidence has been<br>
published yet.<br><br>
The copper sulphide thus formed may create craters/protrusions in localized area<br>
of conductor giving rise to onset of partial discharge or might permeate through<br>
the paper, reducing the breakdown strength of the insulation. Such occurrence<br>
could be the reason of several failures observed in the converter transformers.<br>

Analysis and Field of Invention<br>
There are two major projects related to HVDC in India, one is Rihand Dadri &amp; the<br>
other is Chandrapur-Padghe. One sample (copper conductor &amp; paper sample)<br>
was drawn from Rihand Transformer, which had failed &amp; the other (copper<br>
conductor &amp; paper sample) was drawn from the Chandrapur Transformer, which<br>
was withdrawn form operation due to high Dissolved gases. These samples were<br>
subjected to detailed tests &amp; analysis.<br>
The results are shown in Fig.3 &amp; 4 respectively. The sample of Rihand was found<br>
to contain precipitates of copper sulphides, (Fig.3). Whereas in the sample of C-P<br>
project, oxide deposits were found along with traces of copper sulphide (Fig.4).<br>
Thus the copper conductor of valve windings when coated with thin layer of<br>
enamel insulation totally eliminates the contact of Mercaptan sulphur and<br>
elemental sulphur with base copper of valve windings which in turn also<br>
eliminate the failure of converter transformers. This invention relates to<br>
elimination of contact of oil &amp; base copper surface by use of enamel coating over<br>
copper surface. This excludes the formation of conducting layer of copper<br>
sulphides and other compounds thereby preventing the failure of valve winding.<br><br><br><br>
