Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to gas burners, and particularly, but by no means exclusively, to so-called neat gas burners, in which no or a irunimal amount of air is mixed with the feed gas upstream of the area of combustion. Such burners find application for example, in commercial cooking appliances such as fryers. Background to the Invention and Overview of the Prior Art<br>
Gas burners are well-known and are used in a wide variety of<br>
applications. A typical gas burner may include a burner bar in. the form of a<br>
conduit having a gas inlet and one or more openings along its length to provide<br>
gas outlets through.which the gas is emitted, prior to combustion. The gas is<br>
emitted in the form of  jets, which are. ignited to produce heat. For most<br>
domestic applications, natural gas (a "second family" gas) is used as the fuel,<br>
although "third family" gases such as liquid petroleum gas (LPG), butane and<br>
propane may also be used. Using these types of gas can require that a large<br>
amount of air be available to ensure complete combustion, and this has led to<br>
the use of a "pre-aeration" stage in conventional gas, burners, typically<br>
comprising a short tube in which the air and gas are mixed before the mixture is<br>
emitted through the gas, outlets. Although this pre-aeration stage helps to<br>
achieve complete combustion of the gas, it adds to the cost and complexity of<br>
manufacturing gas burners.<br>
In an attempt to overcome this problem, the technology of neat gas burners has been used. In such burners, no pre-aeration chamber or process are used, upstream of the area of combustion, and thus neat gas burners can be cheaper and simpler to manufacture.<br><br>
This, type of-burner was originally developed to burn "first family" town<br>
. gas, which :i§ derived from, coal, and which does not require as much air as<br>
second and third family gases for complete combustion. In adapting this type of<br>
burner to use second and third family gases, it was found that there was<br>
insufficient air present for complete combustion to occur. To alleviate this, neat<br>
gas burners for. second and third family gases have tended to include a baffle<br>
near the gas outlets such that gas escaping from the outlets is deflected by the<br>
baffle, resulting in turbulence, which causes the gas to mix with the<br>
surrounding air. "The mixture of gas and air is ignited at the point where the gas<br>
hits me baffle, resulting in improved combustion of the gas.<br>
Summary of the Invention <br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
gas burner comprising a gas supply element having an outlet, and a gas<br>
deflector disposed .adjacent the outlet, the position of the deflector, relative to<br>
tiie outlet,. being adjustable so as to allow the extent of deflector-induced<br>
aeration to be altered. <br>
The angle of the deflector, relative to the outlet, may be adjustable.<br>
The spacing of the deflector, relative tothe outlet, may be adjustable.<br>
Preferably both the angle and spacing of the deflector, relative to the<br>
outlet, are adjustable.<br>
The supply element may comprise .a conduit having a plurality of spaced<br>
outlets, the deflector being provided by a baffle surface adjacent the outlets,<br>
such that gas emitted therefrom is incident upon spaced regions of the baffle<br>
surface. <br>
The conduit may be a closed pipe, conveniently being generally straight,<br>
with the baffle surface extending generally parallel thereto.<br>
Preferably; the baffle surface is generally flat<br>
The baffle surface may be inclined relative to the gas streams emitted<br>
through the outlets. <br>
"The baffle surface may have a distal ridge, with the distance -of the distal<br>
ridge.frpm the gas steams desirably being adjustable. <br>
The gas burner may- further comprise an air guide to assist in the<br>
entrainment of air with gas emitted from the outlet<br>
The air guide may have guide surfaces disposed on at least two sides of<br>
the outlet.<br>
The outlet may be. generally horizontally-disposed, with the guide<br>
surfaces being "disposed above and below the outlet<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a gas<br>
burner comprising a gas supply element having an outlet for the emission of a<br>
gas stream, and a gas deflector, disposed,adjacent the outlet to assist in the<br>
aeration of the gas prior to combustion, the baffle surface of the deflector being<br>
inclined to the gas stream at between 40° and 50°. .<br>
The- baffle surface may be inclined at between 44° and 46°, but<br>
preferably is-inclined to the gas stream at approximately 45°.<br>
The deflector may be positioned such that the gas stream hits the<br>
deflector at a region whose height is approximately two thirds of the height of<br>
the deflector, taken from the base thereof.<br>
This has been found to increase the stability of the flame produced by<br>
the combustion of the gas.<br>
Advantageously, the deflector is coated with or made from a ceramic or<br>
ceramic fibre material, to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides (NOx)<br>
produced by the combustion of the gas. .<br>
Specific and-non-limiting embodiments of the aspects of the invention<br>
will now. be described,, by way of example only, with reference to the,<br>
accompanying drawings, hi which: .<br>
.FIGURE 1 shows a part cut-away perspective view of a gas burner<br>
according to the present invention;<br>
FIGURE 2 shows a side view of the gas burner in operation; and<br>
FIGURE 3 shows a schematic view of the gas burner.<br>
Turning first to Fig. 1, a gas burner is shown generally at 10. The gas<br>
burner 10 has a burner bar 11. comprising a partly-sealed length of tubing 12<br>
having a gas inlet (not shown) and a number of gas outlets 13, formed by drilled<br>
holes in the tubing. 12. The gas outlets 13 are .spaced so as to allow easy crossh'ghtmg<br>
of gas streams issuing from'the gas outlets 13. Optionally, gas nozzles<br>
(not shown) may be fitted to the gas outlets 13. Positioned above the burner bar<br>
11 is an air guide plate 14, which is curved to correspond with the outer surface<br>
of the burner bar 11 so as to direct air towards the gas outlets 13, as indicated by<br>
arrow 17. The air guide plate 14 is fitted with a reinforcing lip 19 for added<br>
strength. Facing the gas outlets 13 is a deflector 15, mounted such that a front<br>
face (baffle surface) 23 of the deflector 15 is' angled away from the gas outlets<br>
13. In this example, the .deflector is made from angle iron to prevent<br>
deformation of the deflector 15 at high temperatures, but other materials could<br>
also be used. In particular, the deflector 15 may be made from, or coated with, a<br>
ceramic or ceramic fibre material to help reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides<br>
(NOx) produced. The deflector 15 in this example has a_generally triangular<br>
cross-section for strength.<br>
.However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the<br>
deflector 15 may have any suitable cross-section, or may be a single flat plate.<br>
The horizontal distance.between the burner bar 11 and the deflector 15 is<br>
adjustable in accordance with the application for which the burner is to be used.<br>
The angle of the deflector relative to a horizontal plane is also adjustable, such<br>
that the angle at which the gas streams hit the front face 23 of the deflector 15 is<br>
adjustable, as explained in more detail below.<br>
Turning next to Fig. 2, a gas burner 10 is shown in use. Gas is supplied to<br>
the burner bar 11 through the gas inlet. Gas escapes from the burner bar 11, in<br>
the form of jets/streams 21, through the gas outlets 13. The escaping gas jets-21<br>
. 5 .<br>
hit the deflector 15 and experience turbulence 22, causing the gas to mix with<br>
atmospheric air surrounding the deflector 15. For many feed gases such as<br>
propane, this mixing of the gas with air, combined with the air directed towards -<br>
the escaping gas jets 21 by the air guide plate 14 (indicated by arrows 17), and<br>
air from beneath the burner bar 11 (indicated by. arrows^ 8), ensures that<br>
sufficient air is present to allow complete or near-complete combustion of the<br>
gas-when it is ignited at the deflector 15. However, some gases, such as butane,<br>
require more air for.complete or near-complete combustion. When such gases<br>
are used, an appropriate amount of air may be added to the feed gas stream at<br>
the inlet or in the burner bar 11, to ensure complete, or near-complete,<br>
combustion.. In order to reduce problems caused by "feedback" of gas and/or<br>
combustion products, and to. ensure that the iiecessary turbulence is created, the<br>
air introduced into the feed gas stream must be at a pressure greater than that of<br>
the feed gas. As will be understood by those skilled in the art, additional<br>
controls; which are known per se, may be required to ensure the safety and.<br>
correct operation of such an arrangement In .either case, a fan-shaped flame 16,<br>
generally blue hi.colourj is produced at the deflector 15. . •<br>
Turning lastly to Fig. 3, there is shown a schematic side view of a burner.<br>
Through, testing, it has been found by the applicants that, for a given size of<br>
burner bar, the horizontal distance between the burner bar 11 and the deflector<br>
15 (indicated by arrow 40) is .dependent upon the required heat output of the<br>
burner 10. For small heat outputs, a small distance 40 is required, whereas for<br>
larger heat outputs, a larger distance 40 is required. It has also been found by the<br>
applicants that the amount of aeration of the gas jets 21 issuing from the gas<br>
outlets 13 -is dependent upon the angle 41 at which the gas jets 21 hit the<br>
deflector 15. For example, if the angle 41 is less than 44 degrees, less<br>
turbulence 22 is created'at the deflector 15, which results in less aeration of the<br>
gas jets-21 and thus less complete combustion of the gas 21! Increasing the<br>
angle 41 above 46 degrees also reduces the amount of turbulence 22 <br>
again causing less complete combustion of the gas, as well as giving rise to a<br>
risk that the flame 16 will 'lift off the deflector 15, moving away from a<br>
position at which optimum heating occurs. It has been found that the optimum<br>
angle 41 is 45 degrees to ensure correct aeration of the gas 21 and therefore<br>
complete or near-complete combustion. It has also been found that, for<br>
maximum stability of the flame 16, the point at which the gas 21 hits the<br>
deflector 15 should be approximately two-thirds of the height of the deflector <br>
from the base of the deflector 15, as shown (approximately) in Fig.2.<br>
In the drawings the gas outlets 13 are shown to emit gas in a generally<br>
horizontal direction. It is to be understood that the present invention may<br>
equally.be .employed using gas outlets which emit gas in a more vertical<br>
. direction, although for downward firing applications, it may be necessary to<br>
extract the combustion, products so that they do not interfere with- the<br>
combustion process.<br>
