				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a system for simplifying the programmable memory to logic interface in field programmable gate array (FPGA).<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
An FPGA is a semi custom device based on an array of generic cells or logic blocks, each having a programmable function, surrounded by a programmable interconnect network. Inclusion of RAM blocks in the FPGA architecture saves lot of valuable logic &amp; routing resources. Memory intensive applications are accommodated within an FPGA with embedded RAM blocks. Also, many wide input output functions are absorbed into the RAM blocks, thus saving logic and interconnect resources. Such RAM blocks are generally evenly distributed on the FPGA chip. An interconnect system is provided for the RAM to interface with other logic resources on chip.

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Figure 1 shows an FPGA chip with embedded memory (RAM) in the prior art. Item [1] is a generic programmable logic block (PLB), [3] is the RAM, [la] is the general routing fabric, [2a] are the Input-Output (IO) routing resources and [2] are the IO pads. Figure 2 delineates the interconnect scheme of the prior art for a rudimentary single port RAM. Configurable switches [3] interface the memory to the routing interconnects in the routing channel. These routing lines can also be accessed by logic blocks or IO pads through the routing channel. Thus, a lot of flexibility is provided. But many constraints are introduced and the software for routing such architectures becomes very complex as the memory (RAM) blocks in the FPGA chip are augmented.<br>
The basic embodiment of figure 3 aims to bring forth the advantages of the present invention. Referring to figure 3, a simple single port memory is shown with a plurality of multiplexers [3i] and de-multiplexers [3o] at its input and output pins respectively. It is apparent that the RAM has eight address .inputs and eight data outputs. The inputs to the multiplexers [3i] are outputs from various PLB (or even the same PLB) or from IO pads/routing. Similarly, outputs from de-multiplexers [3o] are being fed to PLB inputs or IO resources. The multiplexer [3i] &amp; de-multiplexer [3o] will be configured during initial configuration of the device. In most cases all [3i] multiplexers and [3o] de-multiplexers can share their respective configuration bits, thus reducing the configuration latch count. The direct interconnects to/from IO routing at the device periphery may be provided to facilitate signals from a range of IO pads rather than a single pad.<br>
Therefore, by using programmable direct interconnects for memory interface. many advantages are in the offering. Some of the major advantages are given below.<br>
It is to be noted that PLBs which interact with the RAM do so only through programmable tappings to/from their inputs or outputs. Their connectivity to the general-purpose routing fabric is not altered in any way. The basic idea of extending direct interconnects from PLBs or lOs is to spare the general purpose routing from the burden of RAM interconnects. It is very obvious that the memory block will network signals to/from cither a sub-circuit or an IO resource. The invention attempts to eliminate any routing that might be used to convey signals between sub-circuits/IOs and the memory. The same arguments hold valid for control<br>
signals to/from the memory. Although some limitations are inherent in terms of flexibility<br>
when direct interconnects are used for memory interface, but the architecture becomes software friendly.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is to provide for devoted bus based routing for clubbing data and address lines in order to combine the RAM blocks to implement larger memories (figure 4). This dedicated routing extends between memory address ports or data ports that might be combined for large memory emulation. As the routing is bus based, configuration latch count is reduced because a bus is routed as a whole against a net-to-net route.<br>
In figure 5, the multiplexer[3i] sourcing a memory input is shown connected to the PLB output via a DI[7o] (Direct Interconnect). The memory block can be used in both asynchronous and synchronous mode. The asynchronous mode comes into picture when the memory block is used to implement combinatorial logic. In this mode, the memory block receives unregistered output[4o] of the LUT via multiplexer[7]. The memory output is directed through multiplexer [3o] to the PLB input [4i] that is an LUT input. The control line of the multiplexers is suitably configured by the configuration latches[5x &amp; 7x].<br>
In the synchronous mode, the memory block is used as a RAM. In this mode, the registered output[6o] of the LUT is connected to the Memory input via the multiplexers [7] &amp; [3i]. The control line of the multiplexer is suitably configured by the configuration latch[7x] to include the flip-flop output. Another possibility is to connect the FF input to [5i] via multiplexer[5]. This enables the memory input signal to bypass the LUT output and approach the FF from general purpose routing. The flip-flop associated with each LUT obviates the need of internal memory registers present at the input of a conventional memory block. The clock of the flip-flop initiates the read/ write operation of the memory.<br>
Similarly, the output registers of the memory become redundant as multiplexer [3o] can drive a PLB input [5i]. Output of multiplexer[3o) is directed to FF[6) via multiplexer [5]. Thus, we can save memory registers internal to the memory in an FPGA with memory blocks.<br>
It is also apparent that if the Flip-Flop is used as a memory input/output register, the LUT can be used to perform independently.<br>
MAJOR ADVANTAGES<br>
1.	Architecture simplified, as switch pattern interfaces between general routing and the<br>
memories are eliminated.<br>
2.	Input/Output registers internal to a memory eliminated.<br>
3.	Symmetric properties of the general purpose routing are preserved.<br>
4.	Memory routing is independent of PLB routing architecture and is bus based. Results in a<br>
symmetrical PLB routing architecture. Configuration latch count in intra-memory routing<br>
is reduced with the additional advantage of improved flexibility in tying up memories.<br>
5.	There is no slack among nets comprising the address/data bus. Negligible slack that might<br>
be introduced while clubbing memories can be easily controlled.<br>
6.	Facilitates even distribution of memory  resources  in the FPGA without  increasing<br>
complexity.<br>
7.	Greatly reduces the formidable task of routing memories to PLBs for the Place &amp; Route<br>
