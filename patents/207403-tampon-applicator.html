				<td>Tampon Applicator<br>
The invention relates to an applicator type tampon having an elongated outer cylinder, a tampon contained therein and a push-out member by which the tampon can be pushed out through a f or-ward delivery opening of the outer cylinder.<br>
A simple applicator of this type is for example described in DE. 29 40 588/ which tampon applicator comprises an outer cylinder which holds in its interior a tampon near its forward end portion. An inner cylinder or plunger is inserted through a rearward opening of the outer cylinder and is slidable therein. Wnen sliding the inner cylinder forward its front end abuts against the rearward end of the tampon, whereby the tampon, upon further advancing the inner cylinder, is "pushed through the delivery opening out of the outer cylinder. The inner cylinder presents, at its rearward end, a planar end surface onto which the user presses with a finger to thereby advance the inner cylinder while holding the outer cylinder with other fingers.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
From DE 30 11 612 a tampon applicator is known comprising an outer cylinder arid a pusher cylinder as pusher member. The pusher cylinder is cut open in its front portion such that two elongated bars or legs are formed which,  in cross-section perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the pusher cylinder, have the shape of segments of the original cylinder wall. In its rearward portion the outer cylinder is provided with openings which are located behind the rearward end of the tampon when the latter is in its initial position in the outer cylinder. Before use the pusher cylinder is positioned with its elongated bars engaging the outer wall of the outer cylinder and with its cylindrical end portion being located behind the rearward end of the outer cylinder. To use the applicator the pusher cylinder is first pulled back until the front ends of said elongated bars are in registration with the openings in the outer cylinder. Then, the forward ends of the bars are introduced into the openings and slid into the interior of the outer cylinder by pushing the pusher cylinder forward. By further advancing the pusher cylinder the tampon is then pushed through the delivery opening out of the outer cylinder. The rearward end surface of the pusher cylinder onto which a finger has to press to advance the pusher cylinder, has a flat supporting surface.<br>
A disadvantage of these prior art applicators is that the handling is difficult and uncomfortable since the finger which has' to rest on the rearward end of the applicator can easily slide off the end surface, in particular since the applicator is usually handled with one hand.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a tampon applicator which can easily be handled and which allows to push out the tampon in an easy and safe way.<br>
This object is achieved by the tampon applicator <br>
 Preferred embodiments of the invention are<br><br>
~ 3 -<br>
indicated in the dependent claims.<br>
According to the present invention the applicator is, on its rearward end opposite to the delivery opening, provided with a recess extending perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the applicator, the cross-sectional contour of the recess being shaped to receive a finger, The recess can for example have the rape of a cylinder segment. Such a flute or groove shaped recess for receiving or seating the finger allows the user to hold the applicator at the rearward end with one finger in a secure manner, without risk that the finger could slide off when using the applicator.<br>
In the above described tampon applicators the pusher member can be formed by a inner cylinder being slidably received in rhe outer cylinder; the recess or finger seat is then provided at the rearward end of the inner cylinder so that the user can advance the inner cylinder with the index finger resting in a secure manner on the rearward end in its seat, without continuously taking care that the finger remains in its proper position on the rearward end of the inner cylinder. In a one piece tampon applicator, as it is described in the prior Patent Application P 197 58 376.8 of the Applicant, the applicator comprises an outer cylinder with an opening in its cylinder wall through which an elongated pusher element is slidable into the interior/ and can be pushed forward by means of a push lever which is connected with its one end to the outer cylinder and with-its other end with the rearward end of the pusher element In such a single piece tampon applicator the recess for seating a. finger is provided at the rearward end of the outer cylinder* In this manner the applicator can be properly oriented with one finger while the push lever is operated with another finger.<br>
In the following the invention is described with reference to preferred embodiments in connection with the/drawings, in which;<br><br>

Figure 1;    shows a side plan view of a first embodiment of a tampon applicator;<br>
Figure 2 :    shows a side cross-sectional view of a second embodiment of the tampon applicator? and<br>
FIgurs 3;    shows a side plan view of the tampon applicator of Figure 2.<br>
Figure 1 shows a first embodiment of the tampon applicator In its Initial position, before use, as it is removed from Its package. The tampon applicator comprises an outer cylinder 10 having a cylindrical hollow interior into which a tampon is inserted. Into the rearward end of the outer  cylinder 10 an. inner cylinder 8 is inserted which is slidably movable within the ouster cylinder 10. In the forward end of the outer cylinder 10 a delivery opening 12 is provided through which the tampon is pushed out from the interior of the outer cylinder 10 when the inner cylinder 8 is pushed forward in the direction to the delivery opening 12*<br>
The rearward end of the inner cylinder 8 is provided with the recess S having the shape of a flute or groove extending perpendicular (in the representation of Figure 1 extending perpendicular to the paper plane) to the longitudinal axis of the applicator. This flute- or groove-shaped recess 6 has, as illustrated in Figure l, a cross-sectional contour which provides for a comfortable and slide-free seat and support of a finger, The shape of the recess can be generally described as a cylinder segment shape.<br>
The recess 6 for supporting a finger allows for example that the Index finger of the user is received and supported therein and pushes the Inner cylinder 8 forward while the outer cylinder 10 is held with other fingers, wherein the user does not have to pay particular attention to -the proper positioning of the index<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
finger on the inner cylinder while pushing it forward, hut the finger "remains, received in the recess 6, properly positioned in the finger seat. To further improve the handling of the applicator the outer surface of the outer cylinder 10 is provided with two circumferential rings or flanges 18, 19 which allow the user to hold the outer cylinder between two fingers, without any danger of the cylinder sliding in longitudinal direction-.<br>
The applicator can be made of plastic, biodegradable  or cardboard. In particular plastic materials such as polyethylene, polypropulene, polyurethane, polyesters, ethylene-vinyl acetate,<br>
polystyrene can be used to form the applicator of the invention. Biodegradable materials which can be used to form the applicator of the invention are for example described in EP 0 606 323 Al; suitable biodegradable materials are for example poly (vinyl alcohol), polyaxyethylene, and the like. The inner cylinder can be formed as a solid or hollow cylinder. In case of a hollow cylinder the recess 6 is formed by two opposite indentations in the rearward end of the wall surface of the inner cylinder $.<br>
Xn Figures 2 and 3 a second embodiment of the invention is shown, in Figure 2 the applicator being illustrated in a cross-sectxonal view and in Figure 3 in a side plan view, Xn the embodiment illustrated in Figures 2 and 3-the tampon applicator is not formed with an inner cylinder but with a pusher member which comprises a push lever 30 and a pusher element 20. In the following the construction and function of this tampon applicator ±s described with reference to Figure 2.<br>
The tampon 2 is positioned within the interior of the outer cylinder 10 so that the front end portion of the tampon 2 is located adjacent to the delivery openingo12 of the outer cylinder 10. Stops 11 on the inner wall of the outer cylinder 10 are provided to prevent the tampon from moving backward t rcir, its initial position adjacent the delivery opening 13*<br><br>
_ 6 -<br>
The outer cylinder 10 is provided with a push lever 30 which is with one of its ends 34 pivotally connected to the exterior of the outer cylinder. At its other end 32 the push lever 30 is pivotally connected to an elongated pusher element 20. An opening 14 is provided in the outer wall of the outer cylinder 10. Through this opening 14 the elongated pusher element 20 can be, with its front end portion 22 leading, slid into the interior of the outer cylinder 10. The opening 14 is located in longitudinal direction between the rear end 3 of the tampon 2 and the rear end 34 of the push lever 30 which is pivotally connected to the outer cylinder 10. The opening 14 can be located in longitudinal direction between the rear end 3 of the tampon 2 and the forward end 32 of the push lever 30, in particular the opening 14 can be, as in the illustrated embodiments, located at the position of the forward end 32 of the push lever 30 when the latter is folded against the outer cylinder 10.<br>
The outer cylinder 10, the push lever 30 and the pusher .element 20 can be integrally formed as a single piece, wherein the pivotal connections between the outer cylinder 10 and the push lever 30 at its end 34 and between the pusher element 20 and the push lever at its and 32 are realized by zones of weakened material. The push lever 30 is, as illustrated, preferably thicker than the push element 20 in order to have more rigidity so that the user can safely press on it and the force is transmitted to the pusher element 20 essentially without bending of the push lever 30.<br>
In order to use the tampon applicator the push lever 30 which is shown in Figure 3 in its initial or start position is pivoted away from the outer surface of the outer cylinder 10, and the tip 22 of the pusher element 20 is inserted into the opening 14 in the cylinder wall. Then, by further turning the push lever 30 towards the outer surface of the outer cylinder the pusher element 20 is being slid further into the interior of the outer cylinder 10 , until it contacts the rearward end 3 of the<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
tampon 2. This position is shown in Figure 2. In this position the applicator is ready for use, and can be introduced into the vagina, thereafter the push lever 30 is further turned towards the outer surface of the outer cylinder 10 with the thumb of the user pressing onto the push lever 30 to further turn the push lever. By further turning the push lever. 30 the pusher element 20 is advanced into the interior of the outer cylinder 10, thereby advancing the tampon 2 and pushing it out of the delivery opening 12 of the outer cylinder 10.<br>
The outer cylinder 10 is provided with two circumferential rings<br>
or flanges 18, 19 which allow the user to grip the applicator between two fingers between the rings 18 and 19 , without any danger that the applicator could slide away in longitudinal direction between the fingers.<br>
In the position as illustrated in Figure 2 and during the fur-ther movement the elongated pusher element 20 does not extend along a straight line but undergoes a certain bending along its longitudinal axis. After inserting the pusher element 30 through the opening 14 and further advancing the pusher element, it, finally, contacts the inner wall of the outer cylinder 10 in area opposite to the opening 14. whereupon the pusher element slight-ly bends during -its progressing movement in the general direc** tion of the longitudinal axis of the outer cylinder, This flexibility or capability of bending is easily achievable if the-pusher element is, as illustrated, formed by a simple rod, the diameter of which can be dimensioned to achieve the, desired flexibility, When making the pusher element of plastic or cardboard the required flexibility is easily achievable.<br>
In the plan view of Figure 3 it can be seer, that the tampon applicator is provided at its rearward end with a recess 6 for receiving a finger. The recess 6 is formed at the rearward end, opoosite to the deXiverv opening 12 on the outer cylinder 10* Tne_ recess 6 has a flute- or groove-shaped cross-sectional- con-<br><br>
