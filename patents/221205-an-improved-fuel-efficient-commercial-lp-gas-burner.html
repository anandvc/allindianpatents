The another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of hydroxy-functinalized trioxanes and their esters of general formula 1, a new series of antimalarial agents.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the  preparation of novel   substituted 1,2,4-trioxanes and their esters of general formula 1 which comprises reacting hydroxyacetophenones of formula 2 wherein X   represents hydrogen or lower alkoxy such as OMe, with α-haloesters   of formula   3 wherein R1 and R2 represent hydrogen,  alleyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl   and  Y represnts halogen such as Cl or Br, in the presence  of a base  optionally in an organic solvent at a temperature in the range range of room temperature to refluxing temperature to give keto-esters of general formula 4, wherein R1, R2 and X have the same meaning as above; reacting keto-esters   of general formula 4 under Reformatsky condition in an aprotic  organic solvent in the temperature range of room temperature to refluxing temperature to give   p-hydroxyesters of general formula   5, wherein Rh R2 and X have the same meaning as above ; dehydrating p-hydroxyesters of formula 5 using a catalyst in an organic solvent at a temperature in the range of room temperature to refluxing temperature to give α,β-unsaturated esters of general formula 6, wherein RI, R2 and X have the same meaning as above ; reducing a,p-unsaturated esters of general formula 6 with a complex metal hydride such as LiAlELt in an ether solvent at a temperature in the range of 0°C to room temperature to give allylic alcohols of formula 7 wherein R1, R2, X have the same meaning as above ; oxygenation of allylic alcohols of formula  7 in presence   of a  sensitizer in an organic solvent at a temperature in   the range    of    -10°C to   room temperature   to   give   p-hydroxyhydroper oxides of general formula 8 wherein RI, R2, X have the same meaning above ; isolating and then reacting or reacting in situ p-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula § with compounds containing aldehyde or ketone group in presence of an acid catalyst in an organic solvent at  a temperature in the range of 0°C to room temperature to  give hydroxy-fiictionalized 1,2,4-trioxanes of general formula   1, wherein RI, R2 and X have the same meaning as above, R3, R4 are hydrogen, alkyl group such as methyl, propyl, aryl group such as phenyl, naphthy! or part of a cyclic system, Rj is H and Zis 0 ; reacting hydroxy-functionalized trioxanes of general formula 1, wherein R is H and Z is 0 with an acid chloride or anhydrides in presence of a base in an organic solvent at a temperature in the range of 0°C to room temperature to give trioxane esters of genera! formula 1, wherein RI, R2, R3, R, and X have the same meaning as above, R3 is alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, aryl group such as phenyl, carboxyalkyl such as CH2CH2C02H; Z is 0-CO.<br>
In the process hydroxyacetophenones of formula 2 are reacted with a-haloesters of formula 3 in presence of a base such as Na2C03, K2C03, KHC03, in an organic solvent such as acetone, dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide or without solvent, to give ketoesters of general formula 4. These ketoesters can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as crystallization or<br>
chromatography using an adsorbent such as silica gel.  All  ketoesters of general  formula 4  except lla (formula 11, RI = R2 = X = H), lie (formula 11, R, = H, R2 = Me, X = H) and 12a (formula 12, R, =<br>
R2 = H) are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier. Ketoesters lla, lie and 12a  are<br>
known   compounds,   [(a) Chim, Ther., 8, 574   (1973),   Indian   J. Oiem., 24, 119 (1985), Chen-Abstracts, 124, 8616e (1996)].<br>
In the process ketoesters of general formula 4 are reacted with ethyl bromoacetate and Zn in an aprotic solvent such as benzene, diethyl ether, to give p-hydroxyesters of general formula 5. These p-hydroxyesters can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as column chromatography using an adsorbent such as silica gel and a hydrocarbon solvent in combination with ethyl acetate as eluent or can be used without purification in the next step, p-hydroxyesters of general formula 5 are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier. These hydroxy esters of general formula S have an additional ester group as part of substitution in the aromatic ring.<br>
In the process dehydration of p-hydroxyesters of geneal formula 5 is accomplished in an hydrocarbon solvent such as benzene, toluene, CH2C12, in the presence of a catalyst such as I2, p-toluenesulfonic acid, P205, or acidic resin such as Amberlyst-15 to give a,p-unsaturated esters of general formula 6. These unsaturated esters can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as chromatography using an adsorbent such as silica gel. a,p-Unsaturated esters of general formula 6 have an addition ester group as part of substitution in the aromatic ring. These esters of general formula 6 are new compounds and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process reduction of and unsaturated esters of general formula 6 is done by reacting the compound with a complex metal hydride such as LiAlHL4 in an ether solvent such as diethyl ether, THF, to give allylic alcohols of general formula 7. These allylic alcohols of general formula 7 have an addition hydroxyl group as hydroxyalkoxy substitution in the aromatic ring. These allylic alcohols of general formula 7 can be isolated and purified by standard laboratory methods such as chromatography using an adsorbent, such as silica gel and a hydrocarbon solvent in combination with ethyl acetate as eluant. Compounds of general formula 7 are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
In the process allylic alcohols of general formula 7 are converted to p-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 8 by passing oxygen gas in the solution of the alcohol in an organic solvent and in the presence of a dye and a light source which provides visible light. The dye which acts as a sensitizer i.e. converts triplet oxygen to highly reactive singlet oxygen, may be such as methylene blue, Rose Bengal,<br>
tetraphenylporpliine. Organic solvent used maybe such as CH2C12, CH3CN, acetone, methanol, benzene. These p-hydroxyhydroperoxides of general formula § can be isolated and purified by known laboratory1 methods or can be used in situ, without purification and isolation, in the next step. These p-hydroxyhydroperoxides of formula 8 are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier. Furthermore, these p-hydroxyhydroperoxides have an extra hydroxyl group in the form of hydroxyalkoxy substitution in the aromatic ring. The novel feature of these p-hydroxyhydroperoxides is that this extra hydroxy! group which is present as a hydroxyalkoxy substituent in the aromatic ring, does not take part in the next reaction i.e. condensation of hydroperoxides with aldehyde and ketones and thus provide 1,2,4-trioxanes which carry a hydroxy group suitable for further derivatization.<br>
In  the process B-hydroxyhydroperoxides of general formula   8 are     converted   lo   hydroxy-fimctionalized   1,2,4-trioxanes     of general     formula   1   (Rs = H, Z = 0)   by     reacting     these hydroperoxides with  carbonyl  compounds  of formula  21-22  in presence  of an acid catalyst in an aprotic organic solvent.   The carbonyi     compounds     used     may   be     such     as     benzaidehyde, naphthaldehyde,  acetone,  ethyl  msthyl  ketone,  methyl  propyl ketone,   methyl   isobutyl   ketone.   4-heptanone,    5-nonanone,    6-undecanone,   dibenzyl ketone and the such as, cyclic ketone    such as cyciopentanone, cyclohexanone, cycloheptanone, bicyclic ketone such as norcomphor (22a) and tricyclic ketone such as  2-adamantanone (22b). The acid catalyst used may be HC1, HaSO^,  p-toiuene sultbraic acid, BF3.OEt2, acidic resin such as Amberlyst-15. The organic solvent used may be CH2C12, CHC!3, benzene, CH3CN. These trioxanes of general formula 1 (R5 = H, Z = O) are stable compounds and can be isolated and purified by standard chromatographic techniques using an adsorbent such as silica gel and a hydrocarbon solvent in combination with polar organic solvent as eluaat. These trioxanes of general formula 1 (R5 = H, Z = 0) are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier. The novel feature of these trioxanes is that they are equipped with a primary hydroxyi group suitable for making derivatives of these trioxanes. This hydroxyl group is part ofalkoxy substituent in the aromatic ring. These trioxanes of general formula 1 (Rj = H, Z = O) have been tested against malarial parasites in animal models and several of them show very promising     antimalarial    activity,    both      against chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant malaria. Tliese trioxanes   are oil-soluble   and can be administered as solution in oil such as groundnut oil.  Some of these trioxanes have shown significant gamatocidal activity.<br>
In the process reaction of trioxanes of general formula 1 (R3 - H, Z = O) with acid chlorides of formula 29 or acid anhydrides of formula 30 wherein R5 is alkyl group such as methyl,  ethyl,  propyl, aryl group such as phenyl, is done in an aprotic organic solvent in the presence of a base to give trioxane esters of general formula 1 wherein R5 is alkyi group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, atyl group such as phenyl, Z is OCO. In the reaction hydroxyl group of trioxanes of formula 1 (R3 = H, Z = 0) is esterified. The acid chlorides and acid anhydrides used may be such as acetyl chloride, benzoyl chloride, propionic anhydride, butyric anhydride, heptanoic anhdride. The base can be such as EtjN, pyridine, with or without the catalyst such as 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The organic solvent<br>
used may be such as CH2C12, CHC13, THF, CH3CN.  These trioxanes of general formula 1 (R, = alkyi,<br><br>
aryl, Z = OCO) can be isolated and purified by known laboratory methods such as crystallization or chromatography using an adsorbent such as silica gel and hydrocarbon solvent hi combination with polar organic solvents as eluant The trioxanes are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier. These trioxanes are oil-soluble and can be administered as solution in edible oil such as groundnut oil. Some of the trioxanes of general formula 1 (Rj = alkyi, aryl, Z = OCO) have shown promising antimalarial activity in animal models.<br>
In the process trioxanes of formula 1 (R5 = H, Z = 0) are reacted with succinic anhydride in an aprotic solvent in presence of tertiary amine with or without the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) to give carboxy fimctionalized trioxanes of general formula 1 (R = CH2CH2CO2H, Z = OCO). The tertiary amine may be such as Et3N, pyridine. Aprotic organic solvent may be such as CH2C12, CHC13, CH3CN, toluene. THF. In the reaction, the hydroxyl group of the trioxanes 1 (Rj - H, Z - 0) is esterified. The trioxanes of general formula 1 (R5 = CH2CH2C02H, Z = OCO) have a carboxyl group and are soluble in aqueous bicarbonate or carbonate solutions. Thus they can be administered both as solution in oil or aqueous bicarbonate/carbonate solutions. Trioxanes of general formula 1 (R3 = CH2CH2C02H, Z = OCO) can be isolated and purified by known laboratory methods such as given above. Trioxanes of general formula 1 (R5 = CH2CH2C02H, Z = OCO) are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier. Some of these trioxanes have shown promising antimalarial activity against both chloroquine-sensitive and resistant malaria in animal models. Some of these trioxanes also show significant gamatocidal activity.<br>

Antimalarial Activity<br><br>
The antimalarial activity of the test compounds was evaluated in rodent using muitidrug resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii Nigenensis in swiss mice.<br>
General Procedure : Random bred swiss mice of either sex (20 ± 2 gm) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 105 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero. The treatment with test compounds were administered to groups of 6 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 24-96 mg/kg/day. The trioxanes were dissolved in groundnut oil (or 50% sodium bicarbonate solutions in case of hemisuccinate derivatives) and were administered via intramuscular or oral route for 4 consecutive days (day 0-3).<br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular interval till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with the vehicle control group and the percent suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated.<br>
For detenning the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28. The dose at which no parasitaemia develop during the observation period has been recorded as the curative dose. The aiitimalarial data is summarized in Table-4.<br>

Trioxane 27a, 271) ande their hemisuccinates 41a and 41b were evaluated for blood schizontocidal activity against Plasmodium. cynomolgi and Plasmodium knowlesi in Rhesus monkeys using the following protocol:<br>
 For activity against P. cynomolgi, rhesus monkeys were inoculated intravenously with 1 x 105 parasitized RBC and the treatment was initiated when the parasitaemia level reached above 0.5%. For activity against P. knowlesi the rhesus monkeys were inoculated intravenously with 1 x 104 parasitized RBC and the treatment was initiated at 0.1% parasitaemia level.<br>
Compounds 27a and 27b were dissolved in groundnut oil and administered in various regimens for 3-5 days via oral or intramuscular (im) routes. Hemisuccinates 41a and 41b were dissolved in 5% bicarbonate solution and administered similarly by oral, im or iv routes.<br>
The blood smears from the treated monkeys were examined once daily to record parasitaemia clearance time and subsequent recurrence of parasitaemia. The animals in which no recrudescence was observed upto day 60 were recorded as cured. The antimalarial data is summerized in table 5 and table 6.<br>

Gametocytocidal .Activity<br>
Compounds 27a and 4la were also tested for gametocytocidal activity according to the following protocol:<br>
Different batches of 3 to 4 days old naive Anopheles stephensis mosquitoes are allowed to engorge blood from gametocyte carrying infected host (rhesus monkey infected with P, cynomolgi or hamster infected with P. yoelii') at different time intervals prior to and after administration with a single dose of the test compound. The blood fed mosquitoes were maintained for the next 7-10 days in an insectorium to allow development of oocysts. A comparison of mosquito infectively rate and oocyst numbers in pre-treatment versus post-treatment provided index for gametocytocidal potential of the test agent.<br>
Compound 27a and 4 la showed complete loss of infectivity in mosquito batches fed 24 h post-treatment with 50 mg/kg (im, single dose) in P. yoelii model and 20 mg/kg (im, single dose) or 30 mg/kg (oral, single dose) in P. cynomolgi model.<br><br><br><br>
