				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (I), their derivatives, analogs, tautomeric forms, stereoisomers, polymorphs, hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions, metabolites and prodrugs thereof, which have strong antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and also against gram-negative bacteria. The present invention more particularly provides novel quaternary ammonium cephems and derivatives thereof, represented by the general formula (I), these compounds are extremely useful for the treatment of infectious diseases.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the above said cephalosporin antibiotics of the general formula (I), their derivatives, analogs, stereoisomers, polymorphs, hydrates, solvates, pharmaceutically acceptable salts and compositions, metabolites and prodrugs thereof. This invention also relates to intermediates useful in the preparation of such compounds.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Cephalosporins are beta-lactams in which the beta-lactam ring is fused to a 6-membered dihydrothiazine ring, thus forming the cephem nucleus. A side chain modification to the cephem nucleus confers in addition to pharmacokinetic advantages an improved spectrum of antibacterial activity.<br>
Bacterial pathogens are classified as either gram-positive or gram- negative and many antibacterial agents, including antibiotics are specific against one or other gram-class of pathogens. Antibacterial agents effective against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens are therefore generally regarded as having a broad-spectrum of activity. In general, 1st generation cephalosporins have better activity against gram-positive bacteria and are less active against gram-negative bacteria, while the 3rd generation agents, with a few exceptions, have a better gram-negative activity and less of gram-positive activity. It is only the 4th generation agents that have both gram- positive and gram-negative activity; few quaternary ammonium cephalosporins are also reported in the literature and some of them are summarized below.<br>
