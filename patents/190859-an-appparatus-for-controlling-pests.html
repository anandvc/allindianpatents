Detailed Description of the Invention In producing 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl 3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate as a pesticidally active agent, there are various methods. As examples of producing the pesticidally active agent, the following Production Examples 1 and 2 are provided.<br>
Production Example 1<br>
Under ice-cooled conditions, 1.82g of (lR)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-((Z)-l-propenyl)cyciopropanecarbonyl chloride was added to a mixture containing 2.24g of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylphenyl) methanol, 0.87g of pyridine and 20mL of tetrahydrofuran. The produced reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hours and was then poured into lOOmL of ice water. Subsequently, the mixture was extracted twice with lOOmL of ethyl acetate and the extracted ethyl acetate layers were mixed together. The ethyl acetate layer mixture was washed with saturated brine, was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and was concentrated under reduced pressure to produce a residue. The residue is subjected to silica gel chromatography (eluent solvent:<br><br>
hexane/ethyl acetate = 20/1) to obtain 3.17g (88% yield) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylphenyl)methyl(lR)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-((Z)-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate. The resulting NMR values thereof are as follows:<br>
1H-NMR (CDCI3, TMS) 6 1.15 (3H,s), 1.28 (3H,s), 1.46 (lH,d), 1.70 (3H,dd), 2.18 (lH,dd), 3.41 (3H,s), 4.59 (2H,s), 5.08-5.12 (lH,m), 5.24 (2H,s), 5.58^-5.62 (lH,m) Production Example 2<br>
Under ice-cooled conditions, 2.18g of (lR)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-(l-propenyl(Z/E=8/l))cyclopropanecarbonyl chloride was added to a mixture containing 2.69g of (253,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylphenyl) methanol, 1.04g of pyridine and 30mL of tetrahydrofuran. The produced reaction mixture was stirred for 8 hours and was then poured into 150mL of ice water. Subsequently, the mixture was extracted twice with 150mL of ethyl acetate and the extracted ethyl acetate layers were mixed  together. The ethyl acetate layer mixture was washed with a saturated brine, was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and was concentrated under reduced pressure to produce a residue. The residue was subjected to silica gel chromatography (eluent solvent: hexane/ethyl acetate = 20/1) to obtain3.68g (yield 85%) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylphenyl)methyl(lR)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-((Z)-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylate. The resulting NMR values thereof are as follows:<br>
1H-NMR (CDCI3, TMS) 6 1.14 (3H,s), {1.24,1,28 (combined to 3H,sx2)}, 1.45<br>
(lH,d), 1.69 (3H,dd), {2.06, 2.18 (combined to lH,ddx2)}, 3.40 (3H,s), 4.58 (2H,s), 5.08-'5.23 (lH,m), 5.22 (2H,s), 5.56'-5.63 (lH,m)<br>
It is worth noting that the present invention may utilize therein pesticidally active isomers of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl 3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-<br><br>
dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate as the pesticidally active agent. Based on the presence of an assymetric carbon atom in 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethyIbenzyI 3-(l-propenyI)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, pesticidally active optical isomers thereof may act as the pesticidally active agent. Further, based on the cyclopropane ring or propenyl double bond in 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate, pesticidally active geometric isomers thereof may act as the pesticidally active agent. In this regard, the present invention may utilize as the pesticidally active agent, mixtures containing the optical isomer and/or geometrical isomer, in which the content of the optical isomer and/or geometrical isomer therein is at a random pesticidally active ratio.<br>
The support used in the methods of the present invention may be a support which can carry the pesticidally active agent and which can allow the pesticidally active agent to vaporize into the surrounding area or atmosphere by raising a relative air current on the surface thereof. Examples of the support include solid supports, those made into a gel form by being soaked with water, those which can be melted so that the pesticidally active agent may be kneaded therein and the like. More particular examples of the support include paper, nonwoven fabric, cloth, spongy plastics, resin films, polyurethane, sponge, silica, montmorillonite, sodium stearate, carageenan, ceramic ahd the like. Further, such supports of the present invention preferably have forms which allow a preferable vaporization of the pesticidally active agent carried therein and which can be easily prepared. As such, a preferable support is typically shaped as a sheet form of at least one selected from paper, nonwoven fabric, cloth, spongy plastics, ceramic and resin films. If so desired, such sheet-shaped supports may be further formed into forms which provide a larger surface area, relative to the volume of the supports. In such cases, such large surface area supports can be prepared bv foldins the<br><br>
sheet support into a suitable form and then laminating that in part, in order to provide corrugated portions on the surface thereof or a honeycomb structure.<br>
The pest control material utilized in the present invention is typically obtained by impregnating, adding or coating the pesticidally active agent to the support. Such methods of providing the pesticidally active agent to the support include kneading the pesticidally active agent into a molten form of the support and then molding the support into a desired form. In having the pesticidally active agent carried in the support, the support usually contains a pesticidally effective amount of the pesticidally active agent. Although such an amount of the pesticidally active agent may vary with the intended purpose of the support, scene and timeframe of the utilizing the support and the like, such an effective amount thereof in the support is usually from 0.01 to lOOg, preferably 0.1 to lOOg and more preferably from 0.1 to lOg.<br>
The pesticidally active agent in the support is typically vaporized and diffused into the surrounding area or atmosphere by raising a relative air current on the surface of the support. A control over the pests can then be provided by diffusing the pesticidally active agent.<br>
The terms "relative air current" as used herein refers to an air current raised by a relative movement of air between the pest control material and the surrounding area thereof. More particularly, when a pest control material remains fixed, a relative air current may be raised on the surface of the support by using a blowing means to allow a wind to blow to the pest control material. The relative air current may also be raised on the surface of the support by sufficiently moving the pest control material. Further, these techniques may be combined.<br>
As examples of the blowing means, there is mentioned a centrifugal fan, a small-sized electric fan and the like.<br><br>
In order to move the pest control material and provide the relative air current thereto, the support having the pesticidally active agent may be provided in a carrier or housing which is shaped as a windmill, propeller, a circular rim rotator which contains slits or the like. The carrier or housing is typically moved to provide the relative air current by rotating or revolving the carrier or housing about an axis.<br>
In the methods of the present invention, the relative air current should have a velocity at the surface of the support which is effective to vaporize and/or diffuse an effective amount of the pesticidally active agent therein. For example, such a velocity of the air current may be from 0.1 to lOm/sec.<br>
In cases of utilizing a tube with the support having the pesticidally active agent, the support is positioned in the tube so that a wind can efficiently pass therethrough. For example, when utilizing a honeycomb or corrugated support, there is mentioned a position in which the corrugated or honeycomb surfaces of the support having the pesticidally active agent is substantially parallel to the direction of the moving wind or the wind from said blowing means. In such cases, the tube may be used to direct wind to the support. For example, in a tube having both ends open, the tube may have at least one corrugated support positioned in the tube, so that the corrugated surfaces thereof are parallel to the direction of the wind and the blowing means positioned at one of the open ends. The tube may have a circular or polygonal cross section such as a trigonal, tetragonal, hexagonal or the like, and that may be made of various materials such as resins, cardboards and the like. In using resins to produce the tube, synthetic resins are typically utilized to produce the tube, with examples of the synthetic resin including polyethylene, polypropylene, copolymers of ethylene in which the units therein contain a polar group such as ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, ethylene-methyl (meth)acrylate copolymers, ethylene-ethyl acrylate copolymers and ethylene-vinyl<br><br>
acetate-methyl (meth)acrylate copolymers, chlorine-containg synthetic resins such as polyvinyl chloride and polyvinylidene chloride and the like. The tube can further have internal projections, slits, holding means, catching means or the like, in order to position and fix the support therein. In order to provide easy access to the pesticidal pest control material in the tube, the tube may also have the portion of the tube where the pest control material is positioned therein formed as a removal cassette or may also have the tube vertically separatable into at least two parts in which the part having the support is openable.<br>
In the methods of the present invention, for the purpose of attaining an excellent stable and lasting control over the pests, the resulting value of the expression:<br>
a xb/c<br>
wherein a is the surface area (m2) of the provided support, b is the velocity (m/sec.) of the relative air current on the surface of the pest control material and c is the amount (g) of the pesticidally active agent in the support, is preferably from 0.001 to 10, more preferably from 0.01 to 1.<br>
The pests which can be controlled by the methods of the present invention include Arthropoda, with examples of the arthropods including various harmful ticks and mites, insanitary insects such as flies, mosquitoes and cockroaches, wood harmful insects, food harmful insects and the like.<br>
As such, one mode of the pest control methods of the present invention may include having the pesticidally active agent in a support to prepare a pest control material and moving the pest control material, thereby generating or providing a relative air current to the material. In such a method, a moving means, such as a motor,<br><br>
may be utilized to move the material. Further, the pest control material may be connected to a shaft and at least one blade extending substantially outwardly and radially from the shaft. The motor may then rotate or revolve the material about the shaft, so that a current of air relative to the material is generated to help vaporizing the pesticidally active agent.<br>
In another mode of the present invention, there may be utilized an apparatus in which the pest control material has a shaft and at least one blade connected thereto. For example, in such an apparatus, the blade may be securely coupled to the shaft and may extend substantially outwardly and radially from the shaft. The blade is also inclined to a plane perpendicular to the shaft. A bearing is also provided therein to hold the pest control material to the shaft, so that the material can rotate or revolve about the shaft. The apparatus further comprises a motor and a fan. The fan is drivingly connected with the motor, so that when the motor rotates or revolves the fan, the fan provides said inclined blade of the pest control material with a current of air which rotates or revolves said material. This rotation or revolution of the pest control material generates an additional relative current of air to help vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. The pest control material may include a plurality of blades equally positioned about the shaft, such that the material is in the form of a propeller. Further, the apparatus may additionally comprise a breathable member surrounding the pest control material.<br>
In one other mode of the present invention, there is utilized an apparatus in which the pest control material has a bearing portion added thereto, at least one horizontal portion extending substantially outwardly and radially from the bearing portion and a rim extending substantially downwardly from the horizontal portion in a form similar to that of a skirt. In addition, the apparatus has a shaft drivingly connected with a motor, so that the motor can rotate or revolve said rim through the shaft.<br><br>
Particularly, the shaft is coupled with the bearing portion of the pest control material, so that the material can rotate or revolve about the shaft by the frictional contact between the bearing portion and the shaft generated by rotating or revolving said shaft. This forms a current of air relative to the pest control material which helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. A fan is also securely coupled to the shaft, so that when the fan rotates or revolves together with the shaft, the fan provides the pest control material with an additional current of air which helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. Preferably, the fan is a centrifugal fan and is positioned in the vicinity of the pest control material.<br>
In yet another mode of the present invention, there is utilized an apparatus having a shaft, a motor for rotating or revolving the shaft, an arm securely coupled with the shaft in which the arm extends substantially outwardly and radially from the shaft. and the pest control material coupled to the arm. As such, when the shaft rotates or revolves, a current of air relative to the pest control material can be provided to the pest control material to help vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. The shaft is also securely coupled with at least one blade inclined to a plane perpendicular with the shaft, such that the blade can provide an additional current of air to help vaporizing the pesticidally active agent.<br>
In even yet another mode of the present invention, there is utilized an apparatus having a vertical member possessing first and second ends. The vertical member is typically fixed at the first end. At least one horizontal member is connected to the second end of the vertical member so that the horizontal member can rotate or revolve about the second end of the vertical member. In this regard, the horizontal member has first and second arms essentially extending in opposite horizontal directions from the second end of the vertical member. The pest control material is typically coupled at the<br><br>
end area of the first arm of the horizontal member. A counterweight is then coupled to the second arm of the horizontal member to compensate for the weight of the pest control material on the first arm. The apparatus also comprises a means for rotating or revolving the horizontal member about the second end of the vertical member and providing a current of air relative to the pest control material. Preferably, the means for rotating the horizontal member includes a motor mounted in or on the pest control material and a propeller drivingly connected with the motor. Further, the counterweight preferably includes a battery for providing electricity to the motor. An electric circuit connecting the motor to the battery is also utilized in the apparatus.<br>
Examples The present invention is further illustrated by the following Example, but is  ' not limited thereby or thereto.<br>
Test Example 1<br>
A spiral material was produced by spirally rolling a 0.5cm x 69cm x 0.5cm piece of paper possessing a honeycomb structure and a surface area of 0.0246 m , so that the spiral had a diameter of 5.5cm and a width of 0.5cm. A solution containing 150 mg of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate in acetone was uniformly coated onto the spiral material. The resulting spiral material was then allowed to dry to substantially remove the acetone therein. As such, a pest control material having a surface area of 0.0246 m2, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, was produced.<br>
The prepared pest control material was placed in the upper portion of a first metal cylindrical tube having an inner diameter of 6.5 cm and a length of 8 cm and an<br><br>
electric fan was provided in the lower portion thereof. The pest control material was placed in the first metal cylindrical tube so that the spiral surface of the pest control material would be perpendicular to the direction of wind provided by the electric fan positioned below.<br>
The pesticidal test was conducted as follows. Ten (10) female adults of common mosquitoes (Culex pipens pallens) were released, respectively, in two (2) glass tubes having a diameter of 4 cm and a height of 12 cm. Both ends of the glass tubes were then closed with polyamide resin nets. The two (2) glass tubes were then placed in a plastic cylindrical cover having a diameter of 18 cm and a height of 30 cm, A second metal cylindrical tube having a diameter of 20 cm and a height of 80 cm was placed under the plastic cylindrical cover and was provided with the pesticidal first metal cylindrical tube at the bottom area thereof. The fan in the pesticidal device was driven for five (5) minutes allowing wind to blow at a velocity of 1.5 m/sec. The number of common mosquitoes knocked down after five minutes was determined, and the knockdown percentage thereof was 100%.<br>
Test Example 2<br>
A spiral material was placed in a screw lid (diameter 2.6 cm, height 1.1 cm). The spiral material was produced by spirally rolling a 1cm x 90cm x 0.2cm piece of paper processing a honeycomb structure and a surface area of 0.0407 m2, so that the spiral material had a diameter of 5.25cm and a width of 1cm. A solution containing 150 mg of 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methoxymethylbenzyl 3-(l-propenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate in acetone was uniformly coated onto the spiral material. The resulting spiral material was then allowed to dry to substantially remove<br><br>
the acetone therein. As such, a pest control material having a surface area of 0.0407 m", as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, was produced.<br>
The prepared pest control material was placed in the upper portion of a first metal cylindrical tube having an inner diameter of 5.5 cm and a length of 8 cm and an electric fan was provided in the lower portion thereof. The pest control material was placed in the first metal cylindrical tube so that the spiral surface of the pest control material would be perpendicular to the direction of wind provided by the electric fan positioned below.<br>
The pesticidal test was conducted as follows. The resulting pesticidal apparatus was placed in a cubic test chamber having a volume of 5.8cm3 and a side length of 1.8m. When the fan was turned on to blow air at 1.45m/sec., 50 female adults of common mosquitoes (Culex pipens pallens) were released therein. The number of mortal common mosquitoes were then measured 2,3,5,7,10,15,20, 25,30 and 40 minutes thereafter. From the achieved measured values thereof, a KT50 value (the time needed to knock down 50% of the common mosquitoes) was found to be 6.4 min.<br>
The above results evidence that the methods of present invention sets forth an excellent pest controlling effect.<br>
With reference to the drawings, pesticidal apparatuses of the present invention will be further described hereinafter. Referring to Fig. 3, there is shown a pesticidal apparatus, generally indicated by reference numeral 20. The pesticidal apparatus 20 has a cylindrical vertical housing 21. The housing 21 is opened at its top opening 22 but closed at its bottom with a partition 23 fixed to the housing 21. The partition 23 has a drive mechanism generally indicated at 24. The drive mechanism 24 includes a case 25 fixed on the partition 23. The case 25 holds a first vertical shaft 26 which can rotate or<br><br>
revolve about the longitudinal axis 27 thereof. Further, the case 25 includes therein a motor 28 drivingly connected with the first vertical shaft 26, so that when the motor 28 is energized, the first vertical shaft 26 rotates or revolves about its longitudinal axis 27. Preferably, the motor 28 is connected with the first vertical shaft 26 through a suitable velocity reduction mechanism such as a well-known pulley and belt mechanism or gear mechanism. The motor 28 is electrically connected with a power source such as battery 29. In this embodiment, although the battery 29 is removably provided below the partition 23, it may be mounted on the partition 23. In such cases, the battery 29 should be positioned so that it can be exchanged with a new battery without substantial difficulty. The motor 28 and the battery 29 should be connected through a manual switch 30 preferably provided on the vertical housing 21, so that when the switch 30 is turned on, the battery 29 supplies a predetermined voltage to the motor 28. Instead of battery 29, a commercial power may be utilized therein.<br>
The first vertical shaft 26 comprises a plurality of blades 32, i.e., a propeller. The blades 32 extend outwardly and radially at equal angles from a top portion of the first vertical shaft 26. In this case, four blades 32 are provided in the Fig.3, but the present invention is not limited to having four blades. Each of the blades 32 is inclined to an imaginary plane, i.e., X-Y plane in Fig. 3, which is perpendicular to the first yertical shaft 26 extending in the vertical direction (direction of Z). In this regard, when the first vertical shaft 26 as well as the blades 32 rotate or revolve in a direction indicated by 33, the blades 32 generate a current of air indicated by arrow 34 flowing toward the top opening 22 of the housing 21. A plurality of air inlets 35 are formed on the housing 21 so that sufficient air can be drawn from the exterior into the interior of the housing 21. Preferably, the air-inlets 35 are formed below the blades 32. Other<br><br>
-.f<br>
air-inlets may also be formed in the partition 23. In this instance with Fig. 3, additional air-inlets should be made on a portion of the housing 21 located under the partition 23.<br>
A bearing member generally indicated at 36 is provided at the top opening 22 of the housing 21. The bearing member 36 includes a vertically extending bearing cylinder 37. A bearing cylinder 37 is fixedly provided at the center of the opening 22 in the housing 21 using a plurality of bridges 38 each extending between the inner surface of the housing 21 and the outer surface of the bearing cylinder 37. Although Fig. 3 shows four bridges at equal angles, the number of the bridges is not limited in the present invention, provided that the bridges can positively hold bearing cylinder 37.<br>
The bearing cylinder 37 holds the pest control material 39, which is entirely or partially made of the support containing the pesticidally active agent. The pest control material 39 is coupled with a second shaft 40. The second shaft 40 is sized to have an' outer diameter slightly smaller than the inner diameter of the bearing cylinder 37, so that the pest control material 39 can be removed there from without substantial difficulty and so that the second shaft 40 can rotate freely in the bearing cylinder 37. In order to help the shaft 40 rotate or revolve more smoothly, i.e., to lower frictional force between opposing surfaces of the second shaft 40 and the bearing cylinder 37, the inner surface of the bearing cylinder 37 may be coated with a low-frictional substance such as polytetrafluoroethylene.<br>
The second shaft 40 is coupled with a plurality of second blades 41, i.e., a second propeller, extending outwardly and radially at equal angles from a top portion of the second shaft 40. Although four second blades 41 are provided on the second shaft 40, the number of second blades in the present invention is not limited thereto. Each of the second blades 41 is inclined with respect to the horizontal plane, i.e., X-Y plane, which is perpendicular to the second shaft 40. In this regard, when the second blades 41<br><br>
catch the air current 34, the second blades 41 provide the pest control material 39 with a rotational or revolutional force in a direction indicated at 42. This typically allows the pest control material 39 to make dynamic contact with air and help vaporization as well as diffusion of the pesticidally active agent into the surrounding area or atmosphere.<br>
For safety, it is preferable to have the pest control material 39 protected by a breathable net or mesh 43. Preferably, the mesh 43 is configured in the form of a dome leaving sufficient space between the mesh 43 and the second propellers 41, such that the mesh 43 does not obstruct the rotation or revolution of the pest control material 39. Preferably, the domed mesh 43 also has at the bottom peripheral edge thereof, a ring 44 made of elastic metal or resin, so that said domed mesh can be easily fitted at the top portion of the housing 21. It should be noted that a mesh size of the mesh 43 should not be a size which prevents the vaporized pesticidally active agent from diffusing into the surrounding area or atmosphere.<br>
When the switch 30 is turned on, the motor 28 is energized to rotate or revolve the first vertical shaft 26 and the first propellers 32 in the direction of 33. As such, an upward air current 34 is generated in the housing 21. The generated air current 34 contacts the surface of the second propellers 41 of the pest control material 39, which then has the second propellers 41 rotate or revolve the pest control material 39 in the direction of 42. The air current 34 helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. In addition, the rotation or revolution of the pest control material 39 and particularly second propellers 41, provides an additional air current 45 relative to the surface of the pest control material 39, which also helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent in the pest control material 39.<br>
The vaporized pesticidally active agent is diffused by the air current 34 and 45 into the surrounding area or atmosphere through the protection mesh 43. If all of or a<br><br>
substantial amount of the pesticidally active agent in the pest control material 39 has been vaporized, the mesh 43 can be removed and a new pest control material holding the pesticidally active agent can replace the old material.<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 and 5, there is shown another pesticidal apparatus of the present invention, generally indicated by reference numeral 50. The pesticidal apparatus 50 has a housing 51 in the form of truncated cone. The housing 51 includes a motor 52 fixed therein and a battery 53 removably mounted therein. The motor 52 and the battery 53 are electrically connected through a manual switch 54 provided on the housing 51, so that when the switch 54 is turned on, the motor 52 is supplied with a predetermined voltage from the battery 53. The housing 51 should be designed and constructed so that the battery 53 can be removed and mounted without substantial difficulty. It is to be understood that the commercial power supply may be utilized instead of the battery 53.<br>
The housing 51 has a vertical shaft 55. The vertical shaft 55 extends along a vertical axis 56. The vertical shaft 55 is drivingly connected with the motor 52, so that when the motor 52 is energized, the vertical shaft 55 rotates or revolves about the vertical axis 56 in the direction of arrow 57. A suitable velocity reduction mechanism such as pulley and belt mechanism or gear mechanism may be provided between the motor 52 and the vertical shaft 55.<br>
The vertical shaft 55 securely holds a centrifugal fan 58. As best shown in Fig. 5, the centrifugal fan 58 has a top circular plate 59 and a bottom ring plate 60 spaced a predetermined distance from the top circular plate 59. Preferably, the top circular plate 59 and the ring plate 60 substantially have the same outer diameter length. Positioned between the top circular plate 59 and the bottom ring plate 60 are a number of fins 61. The fins 61 are securely connected between the top and bottom plates, 59 and 60. Each<br><br>
of the fins 61 is oriented obliquely against a radial direction of the circular plate 59, so that when the centrifugal fan 58 rotates or revolves about an axis extending vertically at the center of the circular plate 59, it draws air in an inner chamber 62 surrounded by fins 61 and then blows it outwardly and radially. The blown air is indicated in Fig. 5 by the arrow 63. In addition, the top circular plate 59 has a through-hole 64 formed at the center of the plate. The through-hole 64 securely receives the vertical shaft 55, which allows the fan 58 to rotate or revolve, based on the rotation or revolution of the vertical shaft 55. The vertical shaft 55 is projected a predetermined length through the top circular plate 59.<br>
The apparatus 50 further includes the pest control material generally indicated at<br>
65.	The pest control material 65, which is entirely or partially made from the support including the pesticidally active agent, has a circular plate 66 and a cylindrical vertical wall 67 (i.e., skirt) extending downwardly from a peripheral edge of the circular plate<br>
66.	The circular plate 66 as well as the vertical wall 67 is sized to have an inner diameter that is greater than an outer diameter of the centrifugal fan 58 so that the pest control material 65 surrounds and covers the centrifugal fan 58 when it takes an operational position shown in Fig. 4. The vertical wall 67 has a number of openings 68. Although each of the openings 68 is in the form of rectangular, the openings 68 may have other configurations. The top circular plate 66 has a cylindrical bearing 69 at the center area and the underneath surface thereof. The cylindrical bearing 69 has an inner diameter slightly greater than the outer diameter of the top projected portion of the vertical shaft 55. This allows the vertical shaft 55 to receive the cylindrical bearing 69 of the pest control material 65, so that the pest control material 65 can rotate or revolve about the vertical shaft 55. In addition, when the vertical shaft 55 rotates or revolves, an efficient amount of frictional force between opposing surfaces of the vertical shaft 55<br><br>
and the cylindrical bearing 69 allows the pest control material 65 to rotate or revolve in the same direction around the vertical shaft 55.<br>
When the switch 54 is turned on, the motor 52 is energized by the voltage supplied from the battery 53 to rotate or revolve the vertical shaft 55 in the direction of the arrow 57. This produces frictional force between the contacting portions of the vertical shaft 55 and the cylindrical bearing 69, which then rotates or revolves the pest control material 65 in the same direction thereof. By rotating or revolving the pest control material 65, the surface of the pest control material 65 makes dynamic air contact with air. Namely, an air current 70 is generated relative to the surface of the pest control material 65. The air current 70 helps vaporization and diffusion of the pesticidally active agent into the surrounding area or atmosphere. Further, the rotation or revolution of the vertical shaft 55 is also transmitted to the fan 58. When the fan   , rotates or revolves in the direction of arrow 57, the fan draws air from the chamber 62 to blow the air outwardly and obliquely toward the vertical wall 67 of the pest control material. This further helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. The pesticidally active agent so vaporized is then diffused into the atmosphere or surrounding area.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, there is shown another pesticidal apparatus of the present invention generally, indicated by reference numeral 80. The apparatus 80 has a base housing 81 in the form of a rectangular box. The housing 81 includes a motor 82 fixed therein and a battery 83 removably mounted therein. The motor 82 and the battery 83 are electrically connected through a manual switch 84 provided on the housing 81, so that when the switch 84 is turned on, the motor 82 is supplied with a predetermined voltage from the battery 83. The housing 81 should be designed and constructed so that the battery 83 can be removed and mounted without any difficulty. Further, it is to be understood that a commercial power supply may be utilized instead of the battery.<br><br>
The housing 81 holds a vertical shaft 85. The vertical shaft 85 extends along a vertical axis 86 and is held for rotating or revolving about the vertical axis 86. The vertical shaft 85 is drivingly connected with the motor 82, so that when the motor 82 is energized, the vertical shaft 85 rotates or revolves about the vertical axis 86 in the direction indicated by arrow 87. A suitable velocity reduction mechanism such as pulley and belt mechanism or gear mechanism may be provided between the motor 82 and the vertical shaft 85.<br>
The vertical shaft 85 holds a plurality of arms 88 extending outwardly and radially from the vertical shaft 85, in which each of the arms 88 are positioned at substantially regular or equal angles from each other. Although four arms 88 are provided in Fig. 6, the number of arms 88 in the present invention is not limited thereto. Each of the arms 88 is coupled with a cylinder 89. The cylinders 89 have openings 91 * and 92 at their opposite ends, and are coupled with the arms so that the openings 91 and 92 are oriented along the horizontal axis 90. A pest control material 93, which is entirely or partially made from the support including the pesticidally active agent, is positioned within each cylinder 89.<br>
The pest control material 93 typically includes at least one support 94 containing the pesticidally active agent (shown in Fig. 7). The support 94 is constructed with a plurality of the cylindrical members 95 having different diameters, which are coaxially arranged about the axis 96. Each cylindrical member 95 is securely connected with the neighboring cylindrical member by a corrugated member 97 substantially running in a zigzag fashion between the cylindrical members, which results in a number of openings 98 between cylindrical members 95 and connecting members 97. The support 94 is removably inserted in the cylinder 89 with the axis 96 oriented toward the openings 91 and 92, so that when the cylinder 89 rotates or revolves in the direction of<br><br>
the arrow 87, the pest control material 93 makes dynamic air-contact with the air at the surfaces of the members 95 and 97 though the openings 98 to provide an air current relative to the surfaces of the members 95 and 97.<br>
It should be noted that although the support 94 contains cylindrical members having different sizes, a support of the present invention may be formed by a spiral member and a corrugated member running in a zigzag fashion between radially neighboring portions of the spiral member. Alternatively, a support of the present invention may also possess a honeycomb structure.<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, the vertical shaft 85 is additionally coupled with a plurality of blades 99, i.e., propellers. The blades 99 extend outwardly and radially from the vertical shaft 85 at regular or equal angles. Although three blades 99 are provided in Fig. 6, the number of blades in the present invention is not limited thereto. Each of the blades 99 is inclined to a horizontal plane, i.e., X-Y plane in Fig. 6, so that when the vertical shaft rotates in the direction of arrow 87, an air current 101 is provided to the cylinders 89.<br>
When the switch 84 is turned on, the motor 82 is energized by a voltage supplied from the battery 83 to rotate or revolve the vertical shaft 85 as well as the cylinders 89 in the direction of the arrow 87, so that the pesticidal support 94 in the cylinder 89 dynamically contacts air. More specifically, a current of air shown in Fig. 7 by an arrow indicated at 100 is generated relative to the surfaces of the members 95 and 97 of the support 94. The current of air 100 helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. Subsequently, the vaporized pesticidally active agent is diffused into the atmosphere or surrounding area. In addition, the blades 99 rotate with the vertical shaft 85 to generate the additional current of air 101, which also helps diffusing the vaporized pesticidally active agent into the atmosphere or surrounding area.<br><br>
Although the blades 99 are provided in Fig. 6, it is not necessary for the apparatus 80 to have the blades 99. In such cases, the pesticidally active agent can be effectively vaporized by the air current 100 relative to the surfaces of the members 95 and 97 of the support.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, there is shown yet another pesticidal apparatus of the present invention, generally indicated by reference numeral 110. The apparatus 110 includes a vertical shaft 111 having upper and lower ends, 112 and 113. The upper end 112 is securely connected to a suitable fixed portion such as the ceiling. The lower end 113 has a coupling member 114 which is connected thereto for rotating or revolving a horizontal shaft 116 about the longitudinal axis 115 of the vertical shaft 111. The coupling member 114 holds the horizontal shaft 116 such that there are first and second arms thereof extending substantially opposite directions from the coupling member   114. The first arm of the horizontal shaft 116 removably holds a pest control material generally indicated at 117. The pest control material 117, resembling an airplane is entirely or partially made of the support containing the pesticidally active agent. The pest control material 117 includes a motor 118 mounted therein. An output shaft 119 from the motor 118 is coupled with a plurality of blades 120, i.e., a propeller. The second arm of the horizontal shaft 116 carries a counterweight 121 in which a battery 122 may be removably mounted therein. The battery 122 is electrically connected to the motor 118 through an electric circuit typically positioned in the horizontal shaft 116. The circuit includes a manual switch 123 preferably provided on the counter weight 121.<br>
When the switch 123 is turned on, a predetermined voltage is supplied from the battery 122 through the power line to the motor 118, in order to energize the motor 118 to rotate or revolve the output shaft 119 and the blades 120. The rotating or revolving<br><br>
blades 120 generates a propelling force, which rotates or revolves the pest control material 117 together with the counter weight 121 in a direction indicated by arrow 124. As a result, the pest control material 117 makes dynamic contact with air, i.e., a current of air is generated relative to the surface of the pest control material 117, which helps vaporizing the pesticidally active agent. The vaporized pesticidally active agent is then diffused into the atmosphere or surrounding area affected by moving the pest control material 117 and battery holder 121.<br><br><br><br>
