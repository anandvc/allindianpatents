				<td>SANITARY NAPKIN WITH STIFF SIDE FLAPS<br>
FIE LD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to disposable absorbent products for absorbing<br>
body fluids and, in particular, to sanitary napkins adapted to be worn against<br>
the perineal region of the body and held in place in the crotch portion of the<br>
undergarment when worn by the user. In a specific non-limiting example of<br>
the inventive principle, the sanitary napkin is provided with a pair of stiff flaps<br>
that are associated to the longitudinal sides of the sanitary napkin and cause<br>
trie sides to bend upwardly as they are parted during placement of the<br>
sanitary napkin on the undergarment of the wearer. The upwardly bent<br>
sides form upstanding barriers that impede body exudate discharged on the<br>
sanitary napkin from leaking past the sides of the sanitary napkin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sanitary napkins are prone to fail when body exudate is discharged<br>
on the napkin at a higher rate than that which the napkin can take up. When<br>
stich failure occurs, body exudate usually leaks at the sides of the sanitary<br>
napkin and soils the undergarment.<br>
One approach to solve this problem has been described in the<br>
international patent application PCT/SE91/00735 filed on October 31. 1991<br>
and published on May 14, 1992 which teaches a sanitary napkin with side<br>
flaps that in use are folded over the edges of the crotch portion of the<br>
undergarment. A portion of each side flap is bonded in a face-to-face<br>
relationship with the flange seal of the sanitary napkin that surrounds the<br>
CAN-135<br>
absorbent system. When the napkin is worn, the side flaps are pulled out<br>
from the sides of the central absorbent pad causing flange seal to raise into<br>
an upstanding barrier. However, in practice, the upstanding barrier may not<br>
always be created. For example, if the width of the central absorbent pad is<br>
not substantially less than the width of the user"s undergarment, it will not be<br>
possible for the flaps to be pulled and maintained in an outward orientation<br>
with respect to the absorbent pad. If the flaps are not maintained in this<br>
position, the upstanding barrier will not be formed.<br>
Against this background, there exists a need in the industry to provide<br>
a sanitary napkin that offers a reduced likelihood of side failure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there has been provided a<br>
sanitary napkin having a main body including at least three superposed<br>
functional layers, namely a fluid permeable body facing layer, an absorbent<br>
layer and a liquid impermeable undergarment facing layer. The main body<br>
has a pair of opposite longitudinal sides and a pair of opposite transverse<br>
sides. The sanitary napkin has at least one flap that is affixed to or<br>
otherwise physically associated with each longitudinal side of the main body.<br>
The flap is characterized as having a rigidity that is sufficient to cause the<br>
longitudinal side to fold upwardly when the flap is subjected to an effort<br>
causing outward displacement of the flap from a first position toward a<br>
second position, in the first position the flap acquiring a more acute angular<br>
relationship to the liquid impermeable undergarment facing layer than in the<br>
second position.<br>
One benefit of this sanitary napkin is the formation of an upstanding<br>
CAN-135<br>
barrier on the main body that impedes the lateral flow of body exudate and<br>
can, therefore, reduce the likelihood of failures. The upstanding barrier<br>
results from the outward displacement of the flap that is normally effected<br>
when the sanitary napkin is installed on the undergarment of the wearer.<br>
The longitudinal side of the main body is maintained in the upwardly oriented<br>
position during the use of the sanitary napkin since the flap is restrained from<br>
moving back toward the liquid impermeable undergarment facing layer by<br>
the undergarment.<br>
Optionally, the main body is manufactured such that the longitudinal<br>
side has a resiliency sufficient to urge the flap into mechanical engagement<br>
with :he crotch portion of the undergarment when the effort causing outward<br>
displacement of the flap from the first position toward the second position<br>
ceases.<br>
Another option is to provide the sanitary napkin with a pair of stiff<br>
flaps, each Hap being associated with a respective longitudinal side. The<br>
upstanding barriers on the main body are formed when the flaps are parted<br>
to install the sanitary napkin on the crotch portion of the undergarment and<br>
they are maintained in this position during the use of the sanitary napkin.<br>
In a specific non-limiting example of implementation, the main body is<br>
generally rectangular with substantially rounded ends. When the main body<br>
is of such a conformation, the transverse sides are the shorter opposing<br>
sicli^s and will generally have an arcuate shape. The longitudinal sides are<br>
the longer opposing sides and will generally be arcuate, typically inwardly<br>
arcuate. It should be understood, however, that the shape of such sides is<br>
not essential to the invention, and thus the transverse or the longitudinal<br>
CAN-135<br>
The sanitary napkin has a pair of flaps each flap affixed to a<br>
respective opposite longitudinal side of the main body. Each flap has a<br>
proximal end portion and a distal end portion. The proximal end portion is<br>
the portion of the flap that is physically attached to the main body while the<br>
distal end portion is the opposite end portion of the flap that is remote from<br>
the main body. Each flap is attached to a portion of the flange seal that<br>
forms a respective longitudinal side of the main body. More specifically, the<br>
surface of the flap that faces the barrier layer is attached in a face to face<br>
relationship to the lower surface of the flange seal (the surface of the flange<br>
seat that is oriented toward the undergarment of the wearer).<br>
At least a portion of each flap is constructed of a material that is<br>
suficiently rigid such that when the flaps are parted to allow the sanitary<br>
napkin to be installed on the crotch portion of the undergarment, they will<br>
raise the flange seal to form a pair of opposite upstanding barriers. The<br>
stillness or rigidity of the flaps should be sufficient to cause the flange seal to<br>
fold upwardly when the flaps are parted. In general, the more rigid the<br>
flange seal, the stiffer the flaps should be. In a specific example, the flaps<br>
are formed from a foam material. Alternatively, the flaps can be formed of a<br>
material that is not inherently rigid but to which rigidity has been imparted by<br>
specific treatments or by addition of specific structures. One specific<br>
treatment to impart or enhance rigidity is embossing. Embossing has the<br>
effect of densifying the material and thus renders it less pliable.<br>
Alternatively, specific structures such as additional layers of material can be<br>
added to reinforce the tab.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown an example of implementation<br>
of a sanitary absorbent article of the present invention, namely a disposable<br>
sanitary napkin 10. The sanitary napkin 10 comprises a main body 12. The<br>
main body 12 has two generally opposing longitudinal sides 14, 16 and an<br>
imaginary longitudinal centerline 18 running down the center of the napkin 10,<br>
generally equidistant from the longitudinal sides 14, 16 and thus bisecting the<br>
main body 12 in two identical halves. The longitudinal sides 14, 16 are<br>
concavely arcuate.<br>
The main body 12 also has two generally opposing transverse sides,<br>
20.22 which are convexly arcuate. An imaginary transverse centertine 24 runs<br>
across the napkin 10, perpendicular to the longitudinal centerfine 18, and thus<br>
CAN-135<br>
bisects the main body 12 in two identical halves.<br>
With reference to Figures 1 and 3, the sanitary napkin 10 is a laminate<br>
stricture and the main body 12 has a cover layer 26 which will face the body of<br>
a wearer when the napkin 10 is in use; a barrier layer 28, which will face the<br>
environment (i.e. away from the body of the wearer, and in almost all cases the<br>
wearer"s undergarment) when the sanitary napkin 10 is in use; and a layer-like<br>
absorbent system 30 therebetween. The absorbent system 30 comprises a<br>
first absorbent layer, commonly called "transfer layer" 32 positioned<br>
immediately underneath the cover layer 26 and a second absorbent layer,<br>
commonly called "absorbent core" 34 that is located between the first<br>
absorbent layer 32 and the barrier layer 28.<br>
The cover layer 26 and the barrier layer 28 are joined along their<br>
marginal portions to form an enclosure or flange seal 40 that maintains the<br>
absorbent system 30 captive. The Joint may be made by means of adhesrves,<br>
heat-bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing, mechanical<br>
cramping, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
In the example of implementation depicted in the drawings, the flange<br>
seal 40 is continuous around the absorbent system 30. Optionally, the flange<br>
seal 40 may be discontinuous, in other words the cover layer 26 and the<br>
turner layer 28 remain unattached to one another at some peripheral areas of<br>
the sanitary napkin.<br>
The main body 12 is provided with a pair of flaps 36, 38 that are affixed<br>
to the respective longitudinal sides 14, 16. The flaps may be either directly<br>
affixed to the sides of the main body or may be affixed through one or more<br>
CAN-135<br>
intermediate components.<br>
Each of the constituent elements of the sanitary napkin 10 will be<br>
described in further detail hereinbeiow.<br>
Cover layer<br>
The cover layer 26 may be a relatively low density, bulky, high-loft non-<br>
woven web material. The cover layer 26 may be composed of only one type of<br>
fiber, such as polyester or polypropylene or it may be composed of bi-<br>
component or conjugate fibers having a low melting point component and a<br>
high melting point component. The fibers may be selected from a variety of<br>
natural and synthetic materials such as nylon, polyester, rayon (in combination<br>
with other fibers), cotton, acrylic fiber and the like and combinations thereof. An<br>
example is the non-woven cover layer of sanitary napkins sold by Johnson &amp;<br>
Johnson inc. of Montreal, Canada under the trademark Stayfree Ultra-Thin<br>
Cottony Dry Cover.<br>
Bi-component fibers may be made up of a polyester core and a<br>
polysthylene sheath. The use of appropriate bi-cornponent materials results in<br>
a fusible non-woven fabric. Examples of such fusible fabrics are described in<br>
U.S. Patent 4,555,432 issued November 28, 1985 to Mays. Using a fusible<br>
fabric increases the ease with which the cover layer may be mounted to the<br>
underlying first absorbent layer and/or to the barrier layer.<br>
Although the individual fibers comprising the cover layer 26 may not be<br>
panculariy hydrophilic the cover layer 26 preferably has a relatively high<br>
degree of wettability. The cover material should also contain a great number of<br>
relatively large pores. This is so because the cover layer 26 is intended to take-<br>
up body fluid rapidly and transport it away from the body and the point of<br>
CAN-135<br>
deposition. Advantageously, the fibers which make up the cover layer 26<br>
should not lose their physical properties when they are wetted, in other words<br>
they should not collapse or lose their resiliency when subjected to water or<br>
body fluid. The cover layer 26 may be treated to allow fluid to readily pass<br>
through it. The cover layer 26 also functions to transfer the fluid quickly to the<br>
other layers of the absorbent system 30. Thus, the cover layer 26 is<br>
advantageously wettable, hydrophiljc, and porous. When composed of<br>
synthetic hydrophobic fibers such as polypropylene or bi-component fibers, the<br>
cover layer 26 may be treated with a surfactant to impart the desired degree of<br>
weltability.<br>
Alternatively, the cover layer 26 can also be made of polymeric film<br>
having large pores. Because of such high porosity, the film accomplishes the<br>
function of quickly transferring body fluid to the inner layers of the absorbent<br>
system. Apertured co-extruded films such as those described in U.S. Patent<br>
4,690,679 and available on sanitary napkins sold by Johnson &amp; Johnson inc.<br>
of Montreal, Canada could be useful as cover layers in the present invention.<br>
The cover layer 26 may be embossed to the absorbent system 30 in<br>
order to aid in promoting fluid transport by fusing the cover layer to the next<br>
layer. Such fusion may be effected locally, at a plurality of sites, or over the<br>
entire contact surface of cover layer 26 with absorbent system 30.<br>
Alternatively, the cover layer 26 may be attached to the absorbent system 30<br>
by other means such as with adhesive.<br>
Absorbent System -First Absorbent Layer (transfer layer)<br>
Adjacent to the cover layer 26 on its inner side and bonded to the cover<br>
layer 26 is the first absorbent layer 32 that forms part of the absorbent system<br>
3C The first absorbent layer 32 provides the means of receiving body fluid<br>
CAN-135<br>
from the cover layer 26 and holding it until an underlying second absorbent<br>
layer has an opportunity to absorb the fluid.<br>
The first absorbent layer 32 is, preferably, more dense than and has a<br>
larger proportion of smaller pores than the cover layer 26. These attributes<br>
allow the first absorbent layer 32 to contain body fluid and hold it away from the<br>
outer side of the cover layer 26, thereby preventing the fluid from re-wetting the<br>
cover layer 26 and its surface. However, the first absorbent layer 32 is,<br>
preferably, not so dense as to prevent the passage of the fluid through it and<br>
into the underlying second absorbent layer 34. These types of absorbent<br>
layers are commonly known as fluid transfer layers or acquisition layers.<br>
The first absorbent layer 32 may be composed of fibrous materials,<br>
such as wood pulp, polyester, rayon, flexible foam, or the like, or combinations<br>
thereof The first absorbent layer 32 may also comprise thermoplastic fibers for<br>
the purpose of stabilizing the layer and maintaining its structural integrity. The<br>
first absorbent layer 32 may be treated with surfactant on one or both sides in<br>
order to increase its wettability, although generally the first absorbent layer 32<br>
is relatively hydrophilic and may not require treatment. The first absorbent layer<br>
32 s preferably bonded on both sides to the adjacent layers, i.e. the cover<br>
layer 26 and an underlying second absorbent layer 34. An example of a<br>
suitable first absorbent layer is a through air bonded pulp sold by BUCKEYE of<br>
Memphis, Tennessee under the designation VIZORB 3008.<br>
Absorbent System—Second Absorbent Layer (Absorbent core)<br>
Immediately adjacent to and bonded to the first absorbent layer 32 is<br>
the second absorbent layer 34.<br>
CAN-135<br>
In one non-limiting example of implementation, the second absorbent<br>
layer 34 is a blend or mixture of cellulosic fibers and superabsorbent disposed<br>
in and amongst fibers of that pulp. The second absorbent layer 34 can contain<br>
any superabsorbent polymer (SAP); SAPs being well known in the art. For the<br>
purposes of the present invention, the term "superabsorbent polymer" (or<br>
"SAP") refers to materials which are capable of absorbing and retaining at least<br>
about 10 times their weight in body fluids under a 0.5 psi pressure. The<br>
superabsorbent polymer particles of the invention may be inorganic or organic<br>
cross linked hydrophilic polymers, such as polyvinyl alcohols, polyethylene<br>
oxides, crosslinked starches, guar gum, xanthan gum, and the like. The<br>
particles may be in the form of a powder, grains, granules, or fibers.<br>
Superabsorbent polymer particles that could be used for the present invention<br>
are crosslinked polyacrylates, such as the product offered by Sumitomo Seika<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd. Of Osaka, Japan, under the designation of SA60N Type<br>
and the product offered by Chemdal International, Inc. of Palatine, Illinois,<br>
under the designation of 2100A*.<br>
In one specific and non-limiting example of implementation, the<br>
cellulosic fiber for use in the second absorbent layer 34 is wood pulp.<br>
For further details on the structure and the method of construction of the<br>
second absorbent layer 34, the reader is invited to refer to the US Patent<br>
5,866,226 granted on February 2, 1999 to Tan et al. The contents of this<br>
document are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Alternatively, the second absorbent layer 34 may include other<br>
absorbent materials such as sphagnum peat moss.<br>
CAN-135<br>
Barrer Layer<br>
Underlying the absorbent system 30 is the barrier layer 28 comprising<br>
liquid-impervious film material so as to prevent liquid that is entrapped in the<br>
absorbent system 30 from egressing the sanitary napkin 10 and staining the<br>
weaver"s undergarment. The barrier layer 28 is preferably made of polymeric<br>
film, such as polyethylene or polyethylene/ethylvinyl acetate (EVA), which are<br>
both inexpensive and readily available. The polymeric film is capable of fully<br>
blocking the passage of liquid or gas that may emanate from the absorbent<br>
system 30. In a variant breathable films, which allow passage of gases while<br>
blocking liquid, may be used. A suitable example is a combination<br>
polyethylene/ethylvinyl acetate (EVA) film sold by the Edison Plastics<br>
Company in the United States under the commercial designation XP-1167B.<br>
Flaps<br>
The sanitary napkin has flaps 36, 38 extending laterally from the<br>
longitudinal sides of the main body and are adapted to be folded over the<br>
edges of a crotch portion of a user"s undergarment. Figure 3 illustrates the<br>
mariner of attaching the flaps 36, 38 to the main body 12 of the sanitary<br>
napkin 10. Each flap has a proximal end portion 70 and a distal end portion<br>
72 The proximal end portion 70 is the area of the flap 36, 38 that is<br>
adjacent the corresponding longitudinal side 14, 16 of the sanitary napkin<br>
10. The distal end portion 72 is the portion of the flap 36, 38 that is remote<br>
from the longitudinal side 14, 16 with which the flap 36, 38 is respectively<br>
associated. In addition, each flap 36, 38 also has an outer face 76 and an<br>
inner face 74. The inner face 74 is the side of the flap 36, 38 that faces the<br>
barrier layer 28 when the flap 36, 38 is in a position such as that shown in<br>
Figure 3, in other words being adjacent or resting against the barrier layer<br>
28. The outer face 76 is the side of the flap 36, 38 that faces away from the<br>
barrier layer 28 when the flap 36, 38 rests against the barrier layer 28.<br>
CAN-135<br>
Each flap 36, 38 is affixed to a corresponding longitudinal side 14, 16<br>
of he main body 12 in a cantilever arrangement and at least a portion of the<br>
flap possesses sufficient rigidity such as to cause the longitudinal side 14, 16<br>
to fold upwardly when the flap 36, 38 is displaced from a position such as<br>
that shown in Figure 3 to a position as shown in Figure 4. In the position<br>
shown in Figure 3, the flap 36, 38 acquires a more acute angular relationship<br>
with relation to the barrier layer 28 than in the position shown at Figure 4.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the configuration acquired by the main body 12<br>
when both flaps 36, 38 are parted to insert the crotch portion of the<br>
endergarment between them. Because of the outward cantilever pivotal<br>
displacement of each flap 36, 38, the longitudinal sides 14, 16 fold upwardly<br>
as discussed above. The parting of the flaps 36, 38 shown in Figure 2 is<br>
somewhat exaggerated. In practice, it will not be required to part the flaps<br>
35, 38 as much to clear the crotch portion of the undergarment. When the<br>
sanitary napkin 10 is installed on the undergarment the flaps 36, 38 are<br>
released. Due to the resiliency of the longitudinal sides 14, 16 of the main<br>
body 12, the flaps 36, 38 have a tendency to at least partially return to their<br>
original position and abut the crotch portion of the undergarment.<br>
The position of the flaps 36, 38 when they rest against the crotch<br>
portion of the undergarment generally corresponds to the position of the flap<br>
36, 38 as shown in Figure 4 for flap 38. In this position of the flaps 36, 38,<br>
two beneficial features arise. Firstly, each longitudinal side 14, 16 is raised<br>
and forms an upstanding barrier on the main body 12 that impedes the<br>
ateral flow of body exudate and can, therefore, reduce the likelihood of<br>
failures. Secondly, the flaps 36, 38 are urged against the crotch portion of<br>
CAN-135<br>
the undergarment and thus engage the undergarment, which has the effect<br>
of stabilizing the sanitary napkin 10 on the undergarment.<br>
Three primary factors determine the extent to which these two<br>
beneficial features will manifest themselves, namely: the rigidity of the flaps<br>
36, 38, the rigidity of the longitudinal sides 14, 16, and the manner of<br>
physical association between the flaps 36, 38 and the longitudinal sides 14,<br>
16.<br>
With regard to the first factor, at least a portion of each flap 36, 38<br>
should possess a rigidity or stiffness sufficient such that when it is displaced<br>
outwardly, such displacement causes the longitudinal side 14, 16 physically<br>
associated with the flap 36, 38 to fold upwardly. A sufficient rigidity can be<br>
obtained by using a material for manufacturing the flap 36, 38 that is<br>
inherently rigid or by conditioning the material to enhance its rigidity in a<br>
specific example of implementation, the flaps 36, 38 are made of polymeric<br>
foam material. Polymeric foam is commercially available in a wide range of<br>
densities and thicknesses from Voltek in Lawrence MA, USA. Conditioning a<br>
material to make it more rigid is generally known in the art and many<br>
possibilities exist. One possibility is to laminate a base material with another<br>
material to form a layered structure that is more rigid than the base material.<br>
Another possibility is to compress the material to density it, which usually<br>
results in a more rigid structure. Yet another possibility is to emboss the<br>
base material to create a pattern of localized densification areas that impart<br>
additional rigidity. This possibility is illustrated in Figure 5. The flaps 36, 38<br>
are made of polymeric foam material that has been locally embossed at 100<br>
to donate to the flaps 36, 38 additional rigidity.<br>
CAN-135<br>
A further possibility to increase the rigidity of the flap 36, 38 is to<br>
impregnate the material of the flap 36, 38 with a liquid, such as any suitable<br>
binder, that makes the base material more rigid when it sets.<br>
With regard to the second factor that is the rigidity of the longitudinal<br>
side 14, 16, if the longitudinal side is very soft and yields readily to bending<br>
pressure, a flap 36, 38 of a lesser rigidity will be needed to cause formation of<br>
an upstanding barrier. At the same time the flap 36, 38 will be urged against<br>
the undergarment with less intensity than if the longitudinal side 14, 16<br>
manifests a strong resiliency. The rigidity of the longitudinal sides 14, 16<br>
depends upon several factors, namely: the number of layers forming the lateral<br>
side 14, 16, the rigidity of the individual layers, the way those individual layers<br>
are conded to one another, among others.<br>
With regard to the third factor that is the manner of physical association<br>
between the flaps 36, 38 and the longitudinal sides 14, 16, the following<br>
observations can be made. Different possibilities exist to physically associate<br>
the f ap 36, 38 to the corresponding longitudinal side 14, 16 such that when the<br>
flap 36, 38 is displaced outwardly, its longitudinal side 14, 16 is folded<br>
upwardly. One such possibility is to directly bond the flap 36,38 to the<br>
longitudinal side 14, 16. Another possibility is to fasten the flap 36, 38 to the<br>
longitudinal side through an intermediate component Under the first:<br>
possibility, the inner face 74 of the proximal end portion of the flap 36, 38 is<br>
bonded to the flange seal 40. The joint may be made by means of adhesives,<br>
heat-bonding, ultrasonic bonding, radio frequency sealing, mechanical<br>
crimping, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
CAN-135<br>
The surface area of the bond between the flap 36. 38 and the<br>
longitudinal side 14, 16 along flange seal 40 influences to what extend the<br>
longtudinal side 14, 16 will fold upwardly when the flap 36, 38 is displaced<br>
outwardly, in particular, the width of the bond surface area (the width is<br>
measured along an imaginary line that is transverse to the longitudinal side 14<br>
16) should be sufficient to cause the formation of an upstanding barrier. Under<br>
a specific and non-limitative example of implementation, the width of the bond<br>
surface area generally corresponds to the width of the flange seal 40.<br>
A possible variant under the first possibility is illustrated in Figure 7 that<br>
shows the sanitary napkin 10 in cross section. It that figure, all the<br>
components of the sanitary napkin 10 that are identical of similar to the<br>
corrponents previously illustrated and described will be designated by the<br>
same reference numerals. Under this variant, the flaps 200 are also<br>
associated with the longitudinal sides 14, 16 in a cantilever arrangement but<br>
the proximal end portion 208 of each flap 200 is folded over the cover layer 26<br>
such that the proximal end portion 208 forms a loop receiving the respective<br>
longitudinal side 14, 16. More specifically, the inner face 204 of each flap 200<br>
is first bonded at the barrier layer 28 at location 210, then folded upwardly so<br>
as to overlay the cover layer 26 and bond with the cover layer 26 at location<br>
212 This realization offers the benefit of a stronger attachment between the<br>
flaps 200 and the longitudinal sides 14, 16.<br>
The reader skilled in the art will recognize that by varying the three<br>
factors discussed earlier, the behavior of the sanitary napkin 10 can be altered<br>
to suit specific applications.<br>
CAN-135<br>
Referring back to Figure 1, the flaps 36, 38 are bonded to the main<br>
body 12 with their respective distal end portions 72 retained to one another by<br>
a frangible bond. This allows the sanitary napkin 10 to be placed on the<br>
uncergarment without using the flaps, if the user so desires. Alternatively, by<br>
separating the proximal end portions 72 from one another, the flaps 36, 38<br>
become operational. In practice, the flaps 36, 38 can be manufactured as a<br>
single unit having across its center a line of weakness 102 that allows to<br>
separate the unit in two identical halves. The line of weakness 102 can be a<br>
line of perforations or any other physical treatment of the material that creates<br>
a local fragile area that will rupture when pulled apart.<br>
In order to enhance the comfort potential of the sanitary napkin 10 the<br>
flaps 36, 38 may be provided with specific materials or treatments designed to<br>
reduce the possibility of irritation of the skin at the area where the flaps 36, 38<br>
contact the thighs of the wearer. One possibility is to laminate the outer face<br>
76 of the flaps 36, 38 with a material that is soft and non-irritating. One such<br>
example is a non-woven fabric. Another possibility is to treat the outer face 76<br>
such that it presents a non-irritating surface. Such a treatment may be<br>
designed to create a very smooth surface or a surface that is soft and<br>
compliant. At the same time, a different treatment may be provided on the<br>
inner face 74 to make that surface rougher such as to reduce slippage<br>
between the flap 36, 38 and the undergarment. It is within the reach of a<br>
person skilled in the art to select the treatment method to create the desired<br>
surface finishes described above.<br>
Another possible refinement that can be considered is to apply on the<br>
inner face 74 a release coating such as silicone coating to prevent accidental<br>
CAN-135<br>
bonding between the flap 36, 38 and the positioning adhesive of the main body<br>
12. The positioning adhesive is discussed below.<br>
Adhesives<br>
Referring back to Figure 1, the barrier layer 28 is provided with an area<br>
of adhesive material 25 to retain the sanitary napkin 10 on the undergarment of<br>
the wearer. The area of adhesive material 25 is rectangular and extends over<br>
the major part of the length of the main body 12. Release paper 104 covers<br>
the adhesive material 25. A suitable adhesive is the composition designated<br>
HL-1491 XZP commercially available from H.B. Fuller Canada, Toronto,<br>
Ontario, Canada. The release paper is of conventional construction (silicone<br>
coated wet-laid Kraft wood pulp) and suitable papers are available from<br>
Tekkote Corporation (Leonia, New Jersey, USA), and bear the designation<br>
FRASER 30#/61629.<br>
In the example of implementation of the invention illustrated in Figure 1,<br>
the adhesive material 25 and the release paper 104 pass under the flaps 36,<br>
38. In a possible variant shown in Figure 6, the flaps 36, 38 are shorter such<br>
that a space is defined between their distal end portions 72. A zone of<br>
adhesive material 22 extends in that space. The advantage of this form of<br>
implementation is that there is little risk of accidentally adhering the flaps 36, 38<br>
to the zone of adhesive material 22. In addition to this zone of adhesive<br>
material 22, the sanitary napkin 10 is provided with two additional zones of<br>
adhesive material 52 and 54 near the transverse end portions 20 and 22 of the<br>
main body 12. The zones of adhesive material 22, 52 and 54 are covered by<br>
release papers, not shown in the drawings.<br>
CAN-135<br>
Test Procedures<br>
Figure 8 illustrates a test set-up to measure the cantilever authority of<br>
the flap 36, 38. The test set-up includes a suitable support (not shown) to<br>
hold he sanitary napkin 10 in a vertical position. An angled probe 42 is<br>
slipped under the flap 36 and the dimension A noted. A is the length of the<br>
flap 26 (measured along the centerline 18) at the area where it contacts the<br>
horizontal segment of the probe 42. To properly assess the dimension A, the<br>
horizontal segment of the probe 42 should be placed as close as possible to<br>
the barrier layer 28 without rubbing too much against the barrier layer. The<br>
objective is to avoid that friction between the horizontal segment of the probe<br>
42 and the barrier layer 28 influences significantly the test results. In<br>
addition, the horizontal segment of the probe 42 is placed vertically as close<br>
as possible to the location where the flap 36 is attached to the main body 12.<br>
The probe 42 is then displaced vertically at a constant speed and the<br>
force at different vertical positions of the probe 42 recorded. The movement<br>
is stopped when the horizontal segment of the probe 42 has cleared the<br>
distal end portion 72. The peak force value is extracted and divided by the<br>
dimension A to obtain a result expressed in grams per centimeter. The test<br>
is performed a total of ten times and the results averaged to obtain the<br>
cantilever authority for the flap 36.<br>
Although various embodiments have been illustrated, this was for the<br>
purpose of describing, but not limiting, the invention. Various modifications<br>
will become apparent to those skilled in the art and are within the scope of<br>
