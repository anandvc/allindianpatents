				<td>SECURITY DEVICE. PROCESS FOR PREPARING A SECURITY DEVICE AND<br>
SECURITY DOCUMENT HAVING ONE OR MORE SECURITY DEVICES<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001]            This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial<br>
No. 60/477,693, filed June 10, 2003.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]            The present invention generally relates to a security device that serves to<br>
increase the design options available for light absorbing security features while more<br>
effectively hiding or concealing these features. The present invention further relates to a<br>
process for preparing such a security device and to a security document having one or more<br>
such security devices at least partially embedded therein and/or mounted thereon.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0003]             It is known that secure documents or instruments may be rendered less<br>
susceptible to forgery or counterfeiting by including security features in various forms within<br>
the body of the document. In fact, the security or integrity of a document or instrument will<br>
increase with the number of separate and distinct security features that it employs.<br>
[0004]            Many security papers and other items of value include a security device or<br>
element, such as a security thread, disposed on or within the document. The security device<br>
typically includes one or more security features, such as metallic, magnetic and/or<br>
luminescent security features, that serve to authenticate the security paper and prevent or<br>
deter counterfeiting.<br>
[0005]            A common type of security thread includes metal-formed characters or indicia<br>
disposed on a plastic carrier substrate. Such threads, which are coated with a very thin<br>
(e.g., 100 to 500 angstrom) layer of metal, such as aluminum, and then demetallized, display<br>
either: discrete metal characters as currently used in United States currency; negative or<br>
reverse-image characters as currently used in the new Euro currency; or a repeating pattern<br>
of isolated metal blocks containing negative or reverse-image characters as described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,486,022 and as used in Indian and Venezuelan currencies. The<br>
characters on fully embedded portions of these threads are visually detectable in transmitted<br>
light by members of the public. Moreover, these threads may be detected by conventional<br>
thread detectors that detect the presence or absence of conductive features on the threads.<br>
The repeating patterns of the threads described in U.S. Patent No. 5,486,022 and employed<br>
in Indian and Venezuelan currencies are machine readable as well as machine detectable.<br>
[0006]              It has long been recognized that while visually detectable or public security<br>
features are both necessary and desirable, the use of machine testable security features<br>
offer a heightened level of security.<br>
[0007]              Magnetic materials have been used as machine testable security features in<br>
security threads. Unfortunately, these materials have a degree of inherent color, which<br>
renders them visually detectable in reflected light through a surface of a security paper.<br>
Attempts have therefore been made to hide or conceal these materials.<br>
[0008]              U.S. Patent No. 5,354,099 to Kaule et al., in an attempt to produce an<br>
improved security thread that matches the appearance of commercially established metallic<br>
threads, provides a means for concealing a magnetic ink. In particular, this reference<br>
discloses a security thread that serves to combine magnetics with negative metal-formed<br>
indicia (i.e., negative writing) on a plastic carrier film. Kaule et al. teach that a metallic<br>
coating, due to its reflective properties, constitutes the outermost layer of the negative<br>
writing. The process disclosed in Kaule et al. for forming the negative writing involves the<br>
formation of multiple layers on the carrier film and the subsequent removal or detachment of<br>
these layers to form the "negative writing". The subject process relies in part on<br>
"mechanically acting treatment methods" to bring out the "negative writing" more clearly.<br>
The ability of the process to produce clear and distinct "negative writing" is enhanced when<br>
foaming additives are used where such additives cause the ink to increase in volume<br>
thereby creating a bulge on the surface of the thread that provides the "mechanically acting<br>
treatment methods" with a good point of attack. See Column 5, lines 2 to 7, of Kaule et al.<br>
[0009]              Unfortunately, the process identified in Kaule et al. is both time-consuming<br>
and arduous. Moreover, combining magnetics with the negative writing limits the design<br>
options available for the magnetic security feature.<br>
[0010]             U.S. Patent No. 6,549,131 to Cote et al. offers an improved method for<br>
concealing magnetic materials. By way of this reference, a laminated security device is<br>
provided that includes a carrier substrate, a first metallic layer disposed on the carrier<br>
substrate, a magnetic layer disposed on the first metallic layer, and a second metallic layer<br>
disposed on the magnetic layer. In one embodiment, these layers collectively form graphic<br>
indicia on the carrier substrate, either positively or negatively. A preferred method of making<br>
the laminated security device of Cote et al. comprises:<br>
a.         providing a carrier substrate;<br>
b.         applying a metallic layer to at least a portion of one surface of the<br>
carrier substrate;<br>
c.         applying a magnetic chemical resist containing a heat and/or pressure<br>
activatable adhesive to at least a portion of the metallic layer, where the magnetic<br>
chemical resist forms a pattern of graphic indicia on the metallic layer;<br>
d.         chemically etching the metallic layer to remove exposed portions of<br>
the metallic layer, where chemical etching is resisted by the magnetic chemical resist<br>
such that the magnetic chemical resist and a portion of the metallic layer underlying<br>
the magnetic chemical resist together form the pattern of graphic indicia on the<br>
carrier substrate; and<br>
e.         applying a foil film, which is provided on a release coated carrier film,<br>
to the pattern of graphic indicia on the carrier substrate under heat and pressure,<br>
causing the foil film to bond and cover or conceal the magnetic regions of the graphic<br>
indicia pattern.<br>
[0011]             Although the method of making the laminated security device of Cote et al.<br>
offers good process economics, integrating the metal and magnetics into a single graphics<br>
design again limits the design options available for the magnetic security feature.<br>
[0012]             The design of the security thread used in the new Euro currency departs<br>
somewhat from the teachings of the prior art references identified above in that instead of<br>
using e.g. vacuum deposited metal, these threads employ silver ink to hide the magnetic<br>
materials. Unfortunately, the magnetic materials are still visible through an overlying surface<br>
of these security papers under reflected light.<br>
[0013]             A need therefore exists for a security device that overcomes the<br>
disadvantages of these prior art security threads.<br>
[0014]              It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide such a security<br>
device.<br>
[0015]              It is a more particular object to provide a security device that increases the<br>
design options for such light absorbing security features.<br>
[0016]              It is another more particular object to provide a security device that serves to<br>
more effectively hide or conceal light absorbing security features, thereby improving the<br>
optical quality of security documents that employ this device.<br>
[0017]              It is yet another more particular object to provide a security device that<br>
employs a second carrier substrate, which allows for the use of additional security features<br>
or elements such as holographic and/or diffractive security features.<br>
[0018]              It is a further more particular object to provide a process for preparing such a<br>
security device, wherein the process reduces manufacturing demands by eliminating the<br>
need to register in one process step and improves process economics by allowing for a<br>
reduction in the thicknesses of the layers which make up the device.<br>
[0019]            It is yet a further more particular object to provide a security document having<br>
one or more such security devices at least partially embedded therein and/or mounted<br>
thereon, wherein the optical quality of the security document is improved in those areas in<br>
which the security device(s) is fully embedded.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0027]             Although the security device of the present invention will be described herein<br>
mainly as a security strip or thread used in association with banknotes, the invention is not<br>
so limited. The security device of the present invention can be utilized in a variety of different<br>
forms with any document or means of identification for authentication purposes.<br>
[0028]             By way of the security device of the present invention, the design options for<br>
the first optionally repeating pattern of indicia (i.e., the machine testable security feature),<br>
which is formed in part from a machine testable light absorbing material, are increased by<br>
physically separating this security feature from the second optionally repeating pattern of<br>
indicia (i.e., the visually detectable or public security feature). The inventive security device<br>
also overcomes the drawbacks inherent in the security threads used in the new Euro<br>
currency by more effectively hiding or concealing light absorbing (e.g., magnetic) security<br>
features.<br>
[0029]             Referring now to the drawings in detail, reference numeral 10 has been used<br>
to generally designate a preferred embodiment of the security device of the present<br>
invention. Security device 10 basically comprises a first carrier substrate 12 having a first<br>
optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 formed thereon, which is fixably attached to a<br>
second carrier substrate 16 having a second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18 formed<br>
thereon. While the first and second optionally repeating patterns of indicia 14,18, may be in<br>
an exactly registered arrangement, such an arrangement is neither necessary nor preferred.<br>
[0030]              The first and second carrier substrates 12,16, are light-transmitting carrier<br>
substrates that have a thickness ranging from about 4 to about 26 microns (preferably from<br>
about 4 to about 12 microns).<br>
[0031]              In a preferred embodiment, each carrier substrate is formed using one or<br>
more essentially colorless polymers selected from the group of polyester, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and mixtures thereof. In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, each carrier substrate is a polyester film.<br>
[0032]              In another preferred embodiment, the carrier substrates 12,16, are colored<br>
and/or luminescent and, in yet another preferred embodiment, at least one carrier substrate<br>
contains optical marks such as diffractive gratings and/or hologram structures.<br>
[0033]              Further to the above, at least one carrier substrate preferably provides<br>
adhesive properties to bond the security device 10 into or onto a security document such as<br>
paper.<br>
[0034]             The first optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 is a machine testable<br>
security feature that embodies machine-detectable and optionally machine-readable<br>
information. The first pattern of indicia 14 comprises:<br>
a.         at least one layer of a machine testable light absorbing material 20<br>
that would be discernible through an overlying or underlying surface of a security<br>
paper in reflected light; and<br>
b.         at least one layer of a camouflage or masking material 22, which is<br>
positioned between the first carrier substrate 12 and the light absorbing material<br>
layer(s) 20.<br>
[0035]             The term "light absorbing", as used herein, is intended to mean any inherently<br>
colored material that would be visually detectable in reflected light through an overlying layer<br>
of a security paper. Such materials typically absorb greater than about 95 % of incident<br>
light.<br>
[0036]              Examples of machine testable, inherently colored materials include, but are<br>
not limited to, magnetic materials and electronically resonating materials.<br>
[0037]             Magnetic materials include both "hard" and "soft" magnetic materials, which<br>
have varying degrees of inherent color ranging from light silver-gray to dark or black.<br>
[0038]              Hard magnetic materials, such as iron oxides, which have relatively high<br>
coercivities (i.e., &gt;10 kiloamperes/meter), are detected by their remanent magnetization after<br>
exposure to a magnetic field. The magnetic field is applied either at manufacture, or just<br>
before detection.<br>
[0039]             Soft magnetic materials, such as nickel cobalt, which has a relatively low<br>
coercivity, can be detected using the permeability, coercivity, B-H<br>
(magnetization/demagnetization) loop, non-linearity and/or magnetization characteristics of<br>
these materials.<br>
[0040]             Soft-magnetic materials, such as pure iron, can be produced as a light silver-<br>
gray pigment. These pigments have a high permeability and, due to their high iron content<br>
(typically 99.5%), they have very high saturation magnetization.<br>
[0041]             The term "camouflage or masking material", as used herein, is intended to<br>
mean any material that renders the light absorbing material virtually undetectable to the<br>
unaided eye in reflected light through a surface of a security document, thereby improving<br>
the optical quality of security documents that employ this device. Such materials typically<br>
reflect greater than about 95 % of incident light.<br>
[0042]              Suitable camouflage or masking materials include, but are not limited to,<br>
metal or metallic materials.<br>
[0043]             Examples of metal or metallic materials, which are suitable for use in the<br>
present invention, include, but are not limited to, aluminum (Al), chromium (Cr), cobalt (Co),<br>
copper (Cu), gold (Au), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), or alloys of two or more of the<br>
aforementioned materials. In a more preferred embodiment, the metal or metallic material is<br>
aluminum.<br>
[0044]             The first optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 or machine testable security<br>
feature may adopt any form or presentation including any type and combination of symbol,<br>
design, shape or other graphic indicia, provided the security feature is substantially covered<br>
or concealed by the second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18.<br>
[0045]             The thickness of the first optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 ranges from<br>
about 1.0 to about 20.0 microns, and preferably ranges from about 3.0 to about 12.0<br>
microns.<br>
[0046]              The first optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 may be prepared using<br>
conventional techniques, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 6,255,948, which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0047]              In a preferred embodiment, the optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 is<br>
formed by printing (via conventional printing techniques, such as gravure or screen printing<br>
methods) directly on a metallized plastic web or sheet using a formulation that contains the<br>
machine testable light absorbing material and a chemical resist for rendering the formulation<br>
resistant to a metal reactive solvent. The printed, metallized plastic web is then exposed to<br>
a metal reactive solvent to chemically etch or dissolve the non-printed metal areas on the<br>
plastic web.<br>
[0048]             Examples of chemical resists include, but are not limited to, solvent based,<br>
water based or solid based, ultraviolet (UV) or electron beam (EB) polymerized resin<br>
systems (e.g., polyester resin systems), and other conventional chemical resist resins.<br>
[0049]             Chemical etching is carried out using appropriate etchants such as sodium<br>
hydroxide, ferric chloride or a hydrofluoric acid/nitric acid mix and techniques that serve to<br>
etch to the full depth of the deposited metal layer(s) in those areas not protected by the<br>
chemical resist resin.<br>
[0050]             In a more preferred embodiment, the machine testable light absorbing<br>
material is magnetic particles and the printing formulation comprises from about 50 to about<br>
95 % by weight of the magnetic particles, and from about 50 to about 5 % by weight of an<br>
etchant resistant resin.<br>
[0051]             The second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18 or public security feature<br>
takes the form of information (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols) that is visually perceivable<br>
when viewed in transmitted light and, optionally, machine-detectable and optionally machine-<br>
readable information, and comprises at least one layer of a metal or metallic material 24.<br>
[0052]             The second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18 may also be prepared<br>
using conventional techniques.<br>
[0053]             In a preferred embodiment, the second optionally repeating pattern of indicia<br>
18 is formed directly on a metallized plastic web or sheet by printing using a clear chemical<br>
resist which is resistant to a metal reactive solvent. The printed, metallized plastic web is<br>
then exposed to a metal reactive solvent to dissolve the non-printed metal areas on the<br>
plastic web. As best shown in FIG. 2B, the formed pattern of indicia 18 is made up of a first<br>
metal layer 24 and a second clear chemical resist layer 26.<br>
[0054]            Suitable clear chemical resists include, but are not limited to, solvent based,<br>
water based or solid based, ultraviolet (UV) or electron beam (EB) polymerized resin<br>
systems (e.g., polyester resin systems).<br>
[0055]            The first carrier substrate 12 may be fixably adhered or laminated to the<br>
second carrier substrate 16 by using a light-transmitting adhesive.<br>
[0056}            Light-transmitting laminating adhesives, suitable for use in the practice of the<br>
present invention, guarantee good bond strength between the carrier substrates and should<br>
be light stable, resistant to ageing, free from fine coagulum and exhibit little foaming.<br>
Examples of such light-transmitting laminating adhesives include, but are not limited to,<br>
acrylic polymers and copolymers, modified acrylic polymers and copolymers and polyesters.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the light-transmitting laminating adhesive is a solvent based<br>
resin solution.<br>
[00571            When embedded in e.g. a banknote, the first and second patterns of indicia<br>
14,18, while physically separated by the second carrier substrate 16, have the appearance<br>
of a single graphics design under transmitted illumination, making it difficult for a<br>
counterfeiter to ascertain how many security features are in fact present. A heightened level<br>
of security is therefore obtained for documents employing the security device 10 of the<br>
present invention. As evident from viewing FIGS. 1A and 1C and FIGS. 2A and 2C, security<br>
device 10 has the additional advantage of looking substantially similar on the front and back<br>
and therefore does not have to be incorporated into ag. a security paper or banknote, true to<br>
side.<br>
[0058]            In order to insure the appearance of a single graphics design under<br>
transmitted illumination, the upper exposed surface of the light absorbing material of the first<br>
optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 must be substantially hidden or concealed by the<br>
second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18. For example, and as best shown in FIGS.<br>
1B, 2B and 3, when the first pattern of indicia 14 is a repeating pattern of geometric shapes,<br>
each geometric shape must be positioned below a solid metal or metallic portion 28 of the<br>
second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18 and must be of a size smaller than (or in<br>
register with) portion 28.<br>
[0059]            As will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art, the fact that the first<br>
optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 does not need to be co-extensive with the second<br>
optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18, allows for a limitless number of design options for<br>
this machine testable security feature.<br>
or coatings, provided however that any such additional layer or coring does not interfere<br>
with the visual perception of the information conveyed by way of the first and second<br>
patterns of indicia 14,18, and/or the signals seen by authenticity testing devices.<br>
Contemplated additional layers or coatings include outer protective layers, light-transmitting<br>
adhesive layers on either or both sides of device 10 that facilitate the incorporation of the<br>
device into or onto security documents and fluorescent coatings made up of eosin,<br>
fluorescein, fluorspar, fuchsin, sulphate of quinine, calcium sulphide, Neodymium salicylate,<br>
Samarium gluconate, Yttrium salicylate and the like.<br>
[0061]            In a preferred embodiment, and as best shown in FIG. 3. security device 10<br>
employs an outer protective layer 30. The outer protective layer 30 is a light-transmitting<br>
protective layer that may take the form of a protective film having a thickness ranging from<br>
about 3.0 to about 12.0 microns (preferably from about 3.0 to about 6.0 microns) or a printed<br>
coating having a thickness ranging from about 1.0 to about 6.0 microns.<br>
[0062]            In a more preferred embodiment, the protective layer 30 is formed using one<br>
or more essentially colorless polymers selected from the group of polyester, polypropylene,<br>
polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and mixtures thereof. In a most preferred<br>
embodiment, the protective layer is a laminated polyester film.<br>
[0063]            In another more preferred embodiment, the protective layer 30 is colored<br>
and/or luminescent and, in yet another more preferred embodiment, the protective layer<br>
provides adhesive properties to bond the security device 10 into or onto paper.<br>
[0064]            The outer protective layer 30 may be laminated to the second pattern of<br>
indicia 18 and to second carrier substrate 16 by using the light-transmitting adhesives<br>
described above.<br>
[0065]            in a most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the first optionally<br>
repeating pattern of indicia 14 comprises a layer of aluminum metal and a layer of a machi/<br>
testable ferro-magnetic material, the second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18<br>
comprises a layer of aluminum metal and a layer of clear chemical resist, and the security<br>
device 10 is prepared by a process comprising:<br>
a. preparing the first optionally repeating pattern of indicia 14 by a<br>
process comprising: printing an optionally repeating pattern of indicia on a first<br>
metallized carrier substrate using a ferro-magnetic chemical resist; and chemica<br>
etching the printed, metallized carrier substrate to remove metal not protected b<br>
ferro-magnetic chemical resist;<br>
b.         laminating a second metallized carrier substrate to the first carrier<br>
substrate 12 using a solvent based adhesive; and<br>
c.         preparing the second optionally repeating pattern of indicia 18 by a<br>
process comprising: printing a pattern of indicia on the second metallized carrier<br>
substrate using a clear chemical resist; and etching the printed, metallized carrier<br>
substrate to remove metal not protected by the clear chemical resist.<br>
[0066]             The inventive process eliminates the need to register the patterns of magnetic<br>
and metallic indicia on the first carrier substrate thereby reducing manufacturing demands<br>
and improving process economics. The inventive process also allows for the use of thinner<br>
layers where the layers do not need to be transferred from an existing structure, as in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,549,131 to Cote et al. Other attractive features inherent in the inventive<br>
process include the fact that the process is amenable to high speed printing and etching<br>
methodologies and the combination of the first and second carrier substrates are equally<br>
amenable to high speed lamination.<br>
[0067]             The security document of the present invention is preferably a security paper<br>
and the security device 10, which is preferably in the form of a security thread, is wholly or<br>
partially embedded within the paper and/or mounted thereon.<br>
[0068]              For partially embedded security devices 10, portions thereof are exposed on<br>
one or opposing surfaces of the security document. In one such embodiment, portions of<br>
the security device 10, which is in the form of a security thread, are exposed on one surface<br>
of the document at spaced intervals along the length of the thread at windows or apertures in<br>
the document.<br>
[0069]             In another such embodiment, the security document is provided with one or<br>
more window-like through openings, with device 10 being exposed at the same location on<br>
both sides of the security document at these openings. The security document may also be<br>
provided with one or more window-like non-through openings which serve to expose device<br>
10 on only one surface or side of the document. While preferably in the form of a security<br>
thread, it is noted that the size and shape of the device 10 is limited only to the extent that it<br>
extend beyond the through and non-through openings on all sides.<br>
[0070]              In a preferred embodiment, the partially embedded security device 10 is<br>
transparent in the region of the window-like through opening(s). In a more preferred<br>
embodiment, the security device 10 is provided with additional security features such as<br>
diffraction structures (e.g., structures having optical-diffraction or optical-refraction effect)<br>
and polarizing filters. For example, the security device 10 may be provided with a polarizing<br>
filter in the region of the window-like through opening and the security document may be<br>
provided with a modified optical image on a surface thereof. The modified optical image<br>
would reveal a hidden message when the document is folded upon itself and the image<br>
viewed through the polarizing filter.<br>
[0071]             The number, size, shape and position of the window-like through and non-<br>
through openings are not limited. In fact, variations in security documents can be made<br>
possible by varying one or more of these features.<br>
[0072]             The security device 10 may be at least partially incorporated in security<br>
papers during manufacture by techniques commonly employed in the papermaking industry.<br>
For example, the inventive device 10 in the form of a security thread may be fed into a<br>
cylinder mold papermaking machine, cylinder vat machine, or similar machine of known<br>
type, resulting in total or partial embedment of the thread within the body of the finished<br>
paper. In one such manufacturing technique, two layers of paper having one or more<br>
window-like through openings are brought together. During the operation of bringing them<br>
together, a security thread is introduced such that at least one window in each layer coincide<br>
in aligned relationship with each other and with the thread so that the security thread is<br>
exposed at the same location on the resulting paper web on both sides thereof.<br>
[0073]              In addition to the above, the security device 10 of the present invention may<br>
be mounted on the surface of security documents (e.g., security papers). In one such<br>
embodiment, the security document is provided with one or more window-like through<br>
openings, at least one of which is covered by the security device 10. The security device 10<br>
projects beyond the opening on all sides and is fixed (over its entire surface area) to the<br>
surface of the security document. As noted above, the size and shape of the device 10 is<br>
limited only to the extent that it extend beyond the through opening on all sides.<br>
[0074]              In the region of the opening the security device 10 is transparent and may be<br>
provided with additional security features such as diffraction structures and polarizing filters.<br>
[0075]              In one contemplated embodiment, the security device 10 is provided with a<br>
polarizing filter in the region overlying the window-like through opening and the security<br>
document is provided with a modified optical image on a surface thereof. The modified<br>
optical image reveals a hidden message when the document is folded upon itself and the<br>
image viewed through the polarizing filter.<br>
[0076]             The window-like through openings may be produced either during<br>
manufacture or during a subsequent converting process by means of, for example, a<br>
punching or cutting (e.g., laser cutting) operation.<br>
[0077]              Mounting of the device 10 to the surface of a security document, or to a<br>
depression formed in the document surface, may be achieved by any number of known<br>
techniques including: applying a pressure-sensitive adhesive to a surface of the device 10<br>
and pressing the device 10 to the optionally depressed surface of the document; and<br>
applying a heat activated adhesive to a surface of the device 10 and applying the device 10,<br>
using thermal transfer techniques, to the optionally depressed surface of the document.<br>
[0078]              Detection schemes contemplated for use with the first optionally repeating<br>
pattern of indicia 14, and possibly also with the second optionally repeating pattern of indicia<br>
18, include simple recognition/authentication schemes and data/identification/denomination<br>
detection schemes.<br>
[0079]              Simple recognition/authentication can be achieved using various properties of<br>
the materials that form indicia patterns 14, 18. In particular, indicia pattern 14 employing<br>
metallic and magnetic materials may be authenticated by, for example, detecting whether or<br>
not one or more metallic and/or magnetic properties are present on security device 10.<br>
[0080]              Detection of metal or metallic security features may be carried out by<br>
detectors that depend upon intrinsic metal properties such as capacitance and microwave<br>
resonance. Such detectors and the detection means or mechanisms upon which they rely<br>
are shown and described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,980,569, 5,279,403, 5,308,992, 5,394,969,<br>
5,417,316, 5,419,424 and 5,810,146, which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0081]              Detection of "hard" magnetic materials having high coercivities of greater than<br>
10 kiloamperes/meter can be detected by their remanent magnetization after exposure to a<br>
magnetic field. The magnetic field can be applied either at manufacture or just before<br>
detection.<br>
[0082]              Detectable magnetic characteristics of "soft" magnetic materials include<br>
permeability, coercivity, B-H (magnetization/demagnetization) loop, non-linearity and<br>
magnetization characteristics. Detection can be accomplished by mid-range (i.e., 1 to 2 mm<br>
between the detector head and the magnetic feature) examination of magnetic properties<br>
with an imposed magnetic field. Such detection schemes are described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,614,824, which is also incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0083]              Data/identification/denomination detection schemes basically involve the use<br>
of one or more material properties (e.g., one or more metallic and/or magnetic properties) for<br>
the purpose of encoding data (i.e., analog or digital) onto a carrier substrate. Once the<br>
security device is employed on or within a security document, the data can be detected,<br>
read, and decoded and the security documents authenticated and identified.<br>
[0084]              Metallic materials and/or magnetic materials (in the form of one or more<br>
"hard" magnetic materials and/or one or more "soft" magnetic materials) may be patterned or<br>
used to encode data onto a carrier substrate in a multitude of ways.<br>
[0085]              Patterning or encoding schemes involving magnetic materials and/or metal or<br>
metallic materials are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,549,131, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
[0086]             While various embodiments of the present invention have been described<br>
above, it should be understood that they have been presented by way of example only, and<br>
not limitation. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by<br>
any of the exemplary embodiments.<br>
