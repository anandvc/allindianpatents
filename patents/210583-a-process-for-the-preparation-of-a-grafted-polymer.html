Grafting Of Ethvlenicallv Unsaturated Monomers Onto Polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of grafted polymers wherein in a first step A) a stable nitroxyl radical is grafted onto a polymer, which step comprises heating a polymer and a compound containing a stable NO. radical to above the melting point of the polymer, mixing and reacting the components at said temperature; and in a second step B) the grafted polymer of step A) is heated in the presence of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer to a temperature at which cleavage of the nitroxyl-polymer bond occurs. Further subjects of the present invention are grafted polymers prepared by said process, the use of the polymeric radical initiator and the use of a stable NO radical for grafting polymers.<br>
Increasing activities have been directed towards chemical modifications of existing polymers in order to obtain functional and/or engineered new material Chemical modifications of existing polymers are important for at least two reasons: 1. They can be an inexpensive and rapid way of obtaining new polymers without having to search for new monomers; 2. they may be the only way to synthesize polymers with the intended new characteristics.<br>
An important chemical modification is the free radical grafting of reactive monomers, which involves reaction of a polymer with a vinyl-group containing monomer or mixture of monomers capable of forming grafts onto the polymer backbone. If the grafts are long, the modified polymer becomes a true graft copolymer, of which the properties will be very different from those of the original polymer substrate. When the grafts are short with less than, for example five moieties, most of the physical and or mechanical properties of the modified polymer substrate will be retained. The properties are furthermore influenced by the structure of the grafted monomer. For example grafting of a polar monomer onto a non polar polymer such as polyethylene, results in decisively modified properties such as adhesion to other substrates, compatibility with polar surfaces, even at short chain lengths.<br>
The advantages of free radical-grafting are further gained with the use of batch mixers or screw extruders as chemical reactors, which allow the free radical-grafting reaction to oocur without solvents. This is for example described by G. H. Hu et al.. in "Reactive Modifiers for Polymers", first edition, Blackie Academic &amp; Professional an Imprint of Chapman &amp; Hall. London 1997, chapter 1, pages 1-97.<br>
These free radical-grafting reactions are usually performed in the presence of a free radical source such as a peroxide and a reactive monomer, such as for example acrylic acid. However the use of free radical sources such as peroxides may cause undesired properties and lead to problems during processing (gel formation, crosslinking, molecular weight reduction) or during<br><br>
use. Typically the long term stability is reduced and/or the polymer cannot anymore be used in outdoor applications or in applications at elevated temperatures.<br>
EP-A-621 878 discloses a free radical polymerization process which controls the growth of polymer chains to produce short chain or oligomeric homopolymers and copolymers, including block and graft copolymers. The process employs a stable free radical as for example of formula (in part) R'R"N-O-and a free radical initiator.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that with such R'R"N-O- compounds it is possible to produce a polymeric radical initiator by grafting the group R'R-N-O to the polymer and to use this macroinitiator for further grafting reactions of olefinically unsaturated monomers.<br>
The polymerization processes and resin products of the present invention are useful in many applications, including a variety of specialty applications, such as for the preparation of grafted block copolymers which are useful as compatibilizing agents for polymer blends, adhesion promoters or dispersing agents for coating systems.<br>
One subject of the present invention is a process for the preparation of a grafted polymer wherein in a first step<br>
A)	a stable nitroxyl radical is grafted onto a polymer, which step comprises heating a polymer and a stable nitroxyl radical (N0«); and in a second step<br>
B)	the grafted polymer of step A) is heated in the presence of an ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer to a temperature at which cleavage of the nitroxyl-polymer bond occurs and polymerization of the ethylenically unsaturated monomer or oligomer is initiated at the polymer radical; maintaining said temperature for further polymerization and afterwards cooling down the mixture to a temperature below 60° C,<br>
The reaction mixture after step A) may also be cooled down to a temperature below 60° C before further reaction of step B) is performed.<br>

Knappe and H, Potente, 1989, pages 3-7. if an extruder is used the process may be described as reactive extrusion process. Examples of reactiv extrusion equipment and processes are given by G, H, Hu et al., in "Reactive Modifiers for Polymers", first edition, Blackie Academic &amp; Professional an Imprint of Chapman &amp; Hall, London 1997, chapter 1, pages 1-97,<br>

The grafted polymers are useful in many applications such as compatibilizers in polymer blends or alloys, adhesion promoters between two different substrates, surface modification agents, nucleating agents, coupling agents between filler and polymer matrix or dispersing agents.<br>
The process is particularly useful for the preparation of grafted block copolymers.<br>
Grafted block copolymers are, for example, grafted block copolymers of polystyrene and polyacrylate (e.g., poly(styrene-co-acry!ate) or poly($tyrene-co-acrylate-cO'Styrene), They are useful! as adhesives or as compatibilizers for polymer blends or as polymer toughening agents. Poly(methylmethacrylate-co- acrylate) diblock graft copolymers or poly(methylacrylate-co-acrylate-co-methacrylate) triblock graft copolymers are useful as dispersing agents for coating systems, as coating additives (e.g. rheological agents, compatibilizers, reactive diluents) or as resin component in coatings(e.g, high solid paints). Graft block copolymers of styrene, (meth)acrylates and/or acrylonitrile are useful for plastics, elastomers and adhesives.<br>
Furthermore, graft block copolymers of this invention, wherein the grafted blocks have polar monomers on a non polar polymer are useful in many applications as amphiphilic surfactants or dispersants for preparing highly uniform polymer blends.<br>
Thus, the present invention also encompasses in the synthesis novel graft block, multi-block, star, gradient, random, hyperbranched and dendritic copolymers.<br>
The polymers prepared by the present invention are particularly useful for following<br>
applications:<br>
adhesives, detergents, dispersants, emulsifiers, surfactants, defoamers, adhesion promoters,<br>

paper treatment, water treatment, electronic materials, paints, coatings, photography, ink<br>
materials, imaging materials, superabsorbants, cosmetics, hair products, preservatives, biocide<br>
materials or modifiers for asphalt, leather, textiles, ceramics and wood.<br>
Because the present graft polymerizaton is a "living" polymerization, it can be started and stopped practically at will. Furthermore, the polymer product retains the functional alkoxyamine group allowing a continuation of the polymerization in a living matter. Thus, in one embodiment of this invention, once the first monomer is consumed in the initial polymerizing step a second monomer can then be added to form a second block on the growing graft polymer chain in a second polymerization step. Therefore it is possible to carry out additional graft polymerizations with the same or different monomer(s) to prepare multi-block graft copolymers.<br><br>
Furthermore, since this is a living radical polymerization, graft blocks can be prepared in essentially any order.<br>

Graft block copolymers of styrene, (meth)acrylates and/or acrylonitrile are useful for plastics, elastomers and adhesives.<br>
Furthermore, graft block copolymers of this invention, wherein the grafted blocks have polar monomers on a non polar polymer are useful in many applications as amphiphilic surfactants or dispersants for preparing highly uniform polymer blends.<br>
