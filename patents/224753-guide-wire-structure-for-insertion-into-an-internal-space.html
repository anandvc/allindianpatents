				<td>Guide wire structure for insertion into an internal space<br>
This invention relates to a guide wire structure for insertion into an internal<br>
space defined by a wall. The invention is particularly concerned with a guide wire<br>
structure which can be inserted into an interior space within a human or animal body.<br>
More particularly, it concerns a guide wire device which can be inserted into, and<br>
moved along, a lumen within the body of a human patient, for example within the<br>
gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a human patient.<br>
A physician typically accesses and visualizes tissue within a patient's<br>
gastrointestinal (GI) tract with a long, flexible endoscope. For the upper GI, a<br>
physician may insert a gastroscope into the sedated patient's mouth to examine and<br>
treat tissue in the esophagus, stomach, and proximal duodenum. For the lower GI, a<br>
physician may insert a colonoscope through the sedated patient's anus to examine the<br>
rectum and colon. Some endoscopes have a working channel, typically about 2.5-<br>
3.5mm in diameter, extending from a port in the handpiece to the distal top of the<br>
flexible shaft. A physician may insert medical instruments into the working channel<br>
to help diagnose or treat tissues within the patient. Physicians commonly take tissue<br>
biopsies from the mucosal lining of the GI tract using a flexible, biopsy forceps<br>
through the working channel of the endoscope.<br>
Insertion of a flexible endoscope, especially into the colon, is usually a very<br>
time-consuming and uncomfortable procedure for the patient, even when sedated with<br>
drugs. A physician often needs several minutes to push a flexible endoscope through<br>
the convoluted sigmoid, descending, transverse, and ascending portions of the colon.<br>
The physician may diagnose and/or treat tissues within the colon either during<br>
insertion or removal of the endoscope. Often the flexible endoscope "loops" within<br>
the colon, such as at the sigmoid colon or at the splenic flexure of the colon, so that it<br>
becomes difficult to further advance the endoscope along the colon. When a loop is<br>
formed, the force exerted to push the scope stretches the mesentery and causes pain<br>
for the patient. Depending on the anatomy of the patient and the skill of the physician<br>
in manipulating the flexible endoscope, some portions of the colon may be<br>
unexamined, thus increasing the risk of undiagnosed disease.<br>
Given® Engineering LTD, Yogneam, Israel, sells a device in the U.S. called<br>
the M2A™ Swallowable Imaging Capsule. The device contains a tiny video camera,<br>
battery, and transmitter. It is propelled through the gastrointestinal tract by natural<br>
peristalsis. The device is currently used for diagnostic purposes and passes through<br>
the intestinal tract with a velocity determined by the natural, peristaltic action of the<br>
patient's body. PCT publication No. WO 01/08548 describes a self-propelling device<br>
adapted to travel through a passage having walls containing contractile tissue. The<br>
applicants disclose that the device is particularly useful as an enteroscope and may<br>
also carry objects such as feeding tubes, guide wires, physiological sensors or<br>
conventional endoscopes within the gut. A summary of other alternative to push<br>
endoscopy can be found in 'Technical Advances and Experimental Devices for<br>
Enteroscopy" by C. Mosse, et al, published in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of<br>
North America, Volume 9, Number 1, January 1999: pp. 145-161.<br>
Guide wires have been used to aid the introduction of catheters and other<br>
instruments into many sites in the human body. Many medical applications and<br>
specific designs of guide wires have been for cardiovascular use. There are, however,<br>
specific challenges relates to the use of guide wires in the GI tract, as opposed to the<br>
vascular system. Thus, the bowel is more tortuous, softer and generally of larger<br>
diameter. Furthermore, in the case of the small intestine and the colon, these are<br>
longer than most arteries or veins. It is an object of an aspect of the invention to<br>
provide a guide wire structure which is capable of being advanced along the GI tract,<br>
and which, under appropriate conditions and with sufficient medical skill, can be used<br>
safely even when passing through complex looped formations of small intestine.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a guide wire structure for<br>
insertion into an interior space defined by a wall, the guide wire structure comprising<br>
at least two guide wires each having a leading end portion which terminates in a<br>
leading end, the guide wires being connected to one another at or adjacent their<br>
leading ends, the guide wires have a first position in which the leading end portions<br>
are substantially parallel to one another, a second position in which the leading end<br>
portions are curved, and a third position in which at least one of the leading end<br>
portions forms a loop. It is to be understood that, as used herein, the term "loop" does<br>
not necessarily denote a complete loop, but also includes a partial loop. It is also to<br>
be understood that the two guide wires (or, where there are more than two guide<br>
wires, any two of the guide wires) may be in the form of a continuous piece of guide<br>
wire material whose two ends are brought together where the connection is formed.<br>
A primary purpose of the above structure is for insertion into an interior space<br>
within a human or animal body, for example into the GI tract of a human patient. It is<br>
believed that the guide wire structure of the present invention should be capable of<br>
being negotiated through the small intestine or colon, and may allow the delivery of<br>
endoscopic devices even to relatively inaccessible parts of the gut such as the cecum<br>
(accessed via the anus) and the distal jejunum and ileum (accessed via the mouth).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention there are precisely two guide wires<br>
connected to one another at their leading ends. For many purposes, two wires are<br>
believed to be sufficient. However, in some circumstances more than two wires may<br>
be appropriate, and the present invention envisages that the guide wire structure may<br>
have three wires, four wires, or even more than four wires.<br>
The invention is described further below with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
Figure la shows an embodiment of guide wire structure according to the<br>
present invention in the condition which it tends to adopt when not in use;<br>
Figure lb shows the structure of Figure la when one of its guide wires is<br>
advanced rightwardly and the other is held steady;<br>
Figure lc shows the structure of Figure la after further righthand advance of<br>
one of the guide wires;<br>
Figure 2 shows an example of a pattern of markings which may be provided<br>
on the guide wires to indicate their relative position to a physician;<br>
Figure 3a to 3c show a guide wire structure according to the invention<br>
advancing into the colon;<br>
Figure 4 shows diagrammatically a handle for use in controlling movement of<br>
the guide wires;<br>
Figures 5a and 5b show successive stages in the use of the guide wire structure<br>
of the present invention in conjunction with a bias tube;<br>
Figures 6a and 6b show successive stages in the use of a cutting catheter to<br>
sever the junction between two guide wires;<br>
Figure 7 shows an embodiment of the invention which comprises two guide<br>
wire structures arranged in parallel;<br>
Figures 8 a to 8c illustrate diagrammatically the use of a guide wire structure<br>
according to the present invention, which has a pivotal junction portion; and<br>
Figure 9 shows yet another guide wire structure according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The structure of Figure la comprises a first guide wire 1 and a second guide<br>
wire 2, the wires 1 and 2 being connected to one another by a junction 3 formed at the<br>
leading ends of the wires 1 and 2. Although the junction 3 is shown as being at the<br>
leading ends, it could alternatively be adjacent the leading ends. The length of the<br>
junction need be no more than is necessary to hold the leading ends securely together<br>
side by side. Depending on the nature of the junction, a length of as little as 5-10 mm<br>
may be sufficient, though a greater length may sometimes be preferable.<br>
The guide wires 2 and 3 can be made of the materials conventionally used for<br>
guide wires, for example straight stainless steel wire, coiled stainless steel wire, glass<br>
fiber, a plastics material, or nitinol. Conveniently, a guide wire has a floppy tip, i.e. a<br>
leading end portion, typically 4-5 cm in length, of greater flexibility than the<br>
remainder of the guide wire, in order to reduce the risk of the leading end of the guide<br>
wire causing damage to the wall of the lumen through which it is passing. Where two<br>
such conventional guide wires are joined together to produce the guide wire structure<br>
of the present invention, it will of course be these floppy tips, or parts thereof, which<br>
are joined together. Preferably, the length of the junction is less than the length of the<br>
floppy tips, so that some length of floppy material remains which is unaffected by the<br>
junction.<br>
The whole or part of each of the guide wires may be coated to reduce its<br>
coefficient of friction, as is done with conventional guide wires. For example, guide<br>
wires can be coated with a low friction material such as silicone, or with a hydrophilic<br>
material which becomes slippery in use in a patient, or with both a low friction<br>
material such as silicone and hydrophilic material applied over the low friction<br>
material.<br>
The junction 3 can be formed in any desired manner, provided the resulting<br>
leading end of the guide wire structure is not such as to damage the wall of the GI<br>
tract or other body lumen, nor cause undue pain when in contact therewith. For<br>
example, the junction can be made by gluing or welding the leading end portions<br>
together and, preferably, then covering those portions with heat shrink tubing.<br>
Alternatively, the end portions could be held together by having a metal band crimped<br>
on to them, optionally enclosed by a cover made of a softer material.<br>
It is not essential for all the guide wires, or both the guide wires, as the case<br>
may be, to be of material which would normally be regarded as guide wire material.<br>
For example, in the case of a guide wire structure consisting of just two guide wires,<br>
one of the guide wires may be made of a thread, which is joined to the other guide<br>
wire by being tied to it.<br>
Yet another possibility would be to start with a single guide wire of twice the<br>
required length and fold it sharply back on itself, for example by crimping the folded<br>
wire adjacent the fold, so that it became, in effect, a pair of guide wires joined at the<br>
fold. A guide wire structure having an even number n of guide wires greater than<br>
two could be formed by folding half that number of guide wires.<br>
The principle of operation of the guide wire structure can be seen by<br>
comparing Figures 1b and 1c with Figure la. Figure 1b shows (he result of advancing<br>
the guide wire 1 rightwardly, as indicated by the arrow, whilst holding the guide wire<br>
2 still. As indicated in Figure lb, this causes the distal region of the guide wire<br>
structure to curve in a direction so that the advanced guide wire 1 is on the outside of<br>
the curve and the still guide wire 2 is on the inside of the curve. Continued<br>
advancement of guide wire 1 beyond the position illustrated in Figure lb, whilst<br>
continuing to hold guide wire 2 steady, results in the formation of a loop in an end<br>
region of guide wire 1. This is illustrated in Figure lc, where the loop is denoted by<br>
reference numeral 4.<br>
To enable the physician to easily advance one of the guide wires while<br>
keeping the other still, the guide wires are preferably received, at their ends remote<br>
from the junction 3, in a handle which can be moved up and down the guide wires as<br>
they are advanced and retracted. The handle should allow precise regulation of the<br>
relative lengths of the two guide wires. It should also allow the introduction of the<br>
various catheters, imagers and other accessories, discussed in more detail below,<br>
giving accurate information on their relationship to the junction 3. The handle may be<br>
provided with a reversible motor drive which enables both guide wires to be driven.<br>
The motor drive itself may provide data to enable the user to monitor the lengths of<br>
the guide wires which have been fed forward.<br>
An example of a handle is illustrated in Figure 4. The illustrated handle 40<br>
comprises a pistol grip 41 within which is mounted a pair of electric motors 42 (of<br>
which one is shown) powered either by a battery 43 or a mains supply 44. The motors<br>
are controlled by respective finger controls 45, one for each motor, each control<br>
having forward, reverse and stop positions. Each motor provides drive, via a<br>
respective gear, shown diagrammatically at 46, to a respective belt or chain drive 47,<br>
each of which propels a respective guide wire 48 forwardly (or backwardly). A<br>
switch 47a is provided to cause the driving belts or chains to move away from the<br>
wires, to allow the wires to be released, for example at the conclusion of a procedure.<br>
A lock mechanism 49 is provided to attach the handle 40 to a catheter or to an<br>
accepting channel of an endoscope, through which the guide wire is to be driven. The<br>
guide wires are stored in a coiled plastics tube 50, either with both wires side by side<br>
in a single tube or each in its own tube. This has the benefit of keeping the guide<br>
wires clean, and avoiding the risk of their trailing on to the floor. Under some<br>
conditions this storage facility may be omitted.<br>
The combined effect of the forms of behaviour illustrated in Figures 1b and 1c<br>
enables the guide wire structure of the present invention to perform in a highly<br>
advantageous manner. Thus, causing the structure to become curved, as shown in<br>
Figure lb, enables the physician to steer the leading end of the structure round bends<br>
in the lumen through which the structure is being advanced. The ability to form a<br>
loop, as illustrated in Figure lc, enables the guide wire structure to adopt as<br>
configuration in which it can be safely advanced along the lumen, without undue<br>
discomfort for the patient.<br>
Furthermore, the presence of a loop at the leading end of the structure rather<br>
than the tip of a single wire, makes the structure more likely to follow the main course<br>
of the lumen, and less likely to inadvertently enter branches off it. Thus, in the case<br>
of the gut, there will be a much reduced tendency to enter, for example, diverticulae<br>
or the orifice of the appendix. However, the fact that the loop is not permanently<br>
present, and can be eliminated by putting the structure into the configuration shown in<br>
Figure la, means that the structure can easily, and without damage to itself, be passed<br>
along a very narrow passageway. It can therefore be passed, for example, along a<br>
channel of an endoscope or down a catheter, as is described further below. Also,<br>
when the guide wire structure is not in an endoscope or catheter, but is advancing<br>
directly along a patient lumen, it is not always desirable to do so with a loop at the<br>
front (for example if it has to pass through a small opening). Under such<br>
circumstances the guide wire structure is allowed to revert to the straight form shown<br>
in Figure la with both guidewires being advanced aligned and in unison.<br>
Figures 3a to 3c show diagrammatically, and by way of example, successive<br>
stages in advancing the guide wire structure of the invention along a colon 30. It is<br>
shown being introduced in conjunction with a catheter 31 within which the whole<br>
guide wire structure is slidably received. The individual guide wires are denoted as<br>
w1 and w2. Advancement takes place by alternately:<br>
(a) pushing one wire forward while holding the other still; and<br>
(b) pushing the catheter forwards as far as the position shows in Figure 3c, or<br>
even somewhat further.<br>
It is desirable in endoscopic procedures to avoid, or at least reduce, the use of<br>
X-ray imaging to monitor what is taking place. With this in mind, the guide wires are<br>
preferably each provided with a pattern of markings, distributed along their length, to<br>
indicate how far each individual guide wire has been inserted. One such pattern in<br>
shown in Figure 2. As shown there, a pattern of markings in a given colour, and<br>
similar in nature to a bar code, is spaced along a first length (L1), and then repeated<br>
along successive lengths (of which only L2 is shown) each time in a different colour.<br>
Each of the lengths could conveniently be of the order of 10cm. This provides a<br>
method by which the physician can easily see which of the guide wires is the further<br>
advanced, and by how much, and enable him, for example, to make the inserted<br>
lengths equal and thus eliminate any curve (Figure 1b) or loop (Figure 1c). Of course,<br>
many other patterns of marking, for example numerals or letters, could be used<br>
instead of that illustrated, which is given only as an example.<br>
Additionally, or instead, the guide wire structure can be provided with other<br>
forms of position indication. It is known to provide a conventional guide wire with a<br>
series of miniature electrically conductive coils which surrounded the guide wire and<br>
are spaced along its length, the coils being connected to a source of electrical current,<br>
whereby each coil becomes a miniature electromagnet. Such coils can be provided on<br>
the guide wires used to form the guide wire structure of the present invention. A<br>
sensing device outside the patient is used to detect the position of the coils within the<br>
patient, and thereby determine the location of the guide wires.<br>
The path of the guide wire structure can be influenced by the use of a catheter,<br>
which can be passed over one or both of the two guide wires, when there are precisely<br>
two, or over one, some, or all of the guide wires, when there are more than two. In<br>
one particularly advantageous embodiment the catheter has a curved tip, which allows<br>
the application of torque to bias the forward motion of the guide wire (or wires) over<br>
which it passes in any given direction. The use of a catheter in this way is illustrated<br>
in Figures 5a and 5b. Figures 5a and 5b show a pair of guide wires 51 and 52 joined<br>
at a junction 53. Guide wire 51 is received within a catheter 54, referred to herein as a<br>
bias tube, the leading end portion of which is so formed as to have a curvature in it.<br>
The guide wire 51 with the bias tube, and the guide wire 52, are both received within<br>
an outer catheter 55. The ends of the catheters 51 and 52 remote from their tips<br>
emerge from the catheter 55 to allow them to selectively advance and retract. The end<br>
of the bias tube 54 remote from the curved end thereof emerges from the outer<br>
catheter 55 at the user's end. As can be seen by comparing the state shown in Figure<br>
5a with the subsequent state shown in Figure 5b, in advancing both the guide wires,<br>
but advancing guide wire 51 more than guide wire 52, the bias tube helps to ensure<br>
that the combined guide wire structure curves in the desired direction. If it were<br>
desired to cause the structure to advance in some other direction, this could be<br>
achieved by twisting the catheter 55 about its longitudinal axis, thus altering the<br>
positions of the guide wires relative to the lumen in which they are being advanced.<br>
The purpose of the guide wire is, as its name indicates, to act as a guide for<br>
some other element. Accordingly, when the guide wire structure of the present<br>
invention is in place some other element is then passed over it.<br>
As in the case of a catheter used to influence the path of a guide wire structure<br>
during passage of the guide wire structure along a lumen, a catheter introduced<br>
subsequently can pass over one or both of the guide wires, when there are precisely<br>
two, or over one, some, or all of the guide wires, when there are more than two.<br>
When the catheter is passed over both, or all, the guide wires, as the case may be, the<br>
leading end of the catheter will be free to pass beyond the leading end of the guide<br>
wire structure once it reaches that point. If the catheter is not passed over both, or all,<br>
the guide wires, for example if it is passed over only one of two interconnected guide<br>
wires, the leading end of the catheter will normally be unable to pass beyond the<br>
connection between the guide wires. That may be desirable, for the purpose of<br>
ensuring that the leading end of the catheter can be brought to a position previously<br>
defined by the leading end of the guide wire structure. It also has the result, however,<br>
that if the guide wire structure is withdrawn, the catheter must be withdrawn with it.<br>
If it is desired to enable the leading end of the catheter to pass beyond the end<br>
of the guide wire over which it is travelling, or to enable the catheter to remain in<br>
position after the guide wire has been withdrawn, this can be achieved by providing<br>
the leading end of the catheter with a cutting device. The use of such a catheter is<br>
illustrated in Figures 6a and 6b. Figures 6a and 6b show guide wires 61 and 62<br>
connected by a junction 63 and extending within an outer catheter 65. A cutting<br>
catheter 64 surrounds one of the guide wires, in this case the guide wire 61. The<br>
catheter 64 has a cutting tip (not visible in Figure 6a) which, when the catheter 64 is<br>
advanced over the guide wire 61, severs the junction 63. Figure 6b shows the<br>
severing operation partly completed.<br>
The cutting catheter comprises a cylindrical cutting member 66 with a circular<br>
cutting edge 67 (visible in Figure 6b but not in Figure 6a) formed at its leading end.<br>
When not in use the cutting edge is shielded by a generally cylindrical sheath 68<br>
which is biased to a forward protecting position by a compression spring 69 located<br>
between the rearward end of the sheath 68 and a stop 70 fixed to the end of the<br>
catheter. When the cutting catheter is pushed forwards, against the force of the spring<br>
69, as it is in Figure 6b, the cutting edge 67 emerges from the sheath 68 and severs the<br>
junction 63. As soon as severing is completed the spring automatically causes the<br>
sheath 68 to move forwards, covering the cutting edge 67 and preventing it from<br>
harming the patient.<br>
Once a sufficiently large guide wire loop has been formed in, say, the gut, it<br>
becomes possible to pull the gut backwards to some extent, using the friction between<br>
the loop and the wall of the gut. To do this, both guide wires are pulled backwards in<br>
synchronism. This provides a means for straightening the gut, and this in turn makes<br>
it easier to advance the guide wire structure further or, indeed, to advance other<br>
structures (e.g. endoscopes), and reduces the pain of the procedure, which is mainly<br>
caused by stretching nerve endings in the mesentery.<br>
The above described concept of using a guide wire loop to straighten a<br>
passageway, e.g. the gut, can be further developed in an embodiment of the present<br>
invention which employs two guide wire structures operating in parallel. An example<br>
of such an embodiment is shown in Figure 7. This comprises two parallel catheters<br>
72a and 72b, which are preferably connected together side by side in such a way as to<br>
allow each to move longitudinally with respect to the other. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment the connection is provided by a T-shaped stud 73 formed on catheter 72a<br>
which is slidable in a correspondingly shaped passageway 74 formed in catheter 72b<br>
and running longitudinally along it. A single stud may be provided, or a plurality of<br>
studs spaced along the length of catheter 72a, or there may be a continuous stud<br>
running along all or part of the length of catheter 72a. Catheter 72a receives a first<br>
guide wire structure 75a, comprising a pair of wires w1 and w2 joined at a junction<br>
76a. Catheter 72b receives a guide wire structure 75b, comprising a pair of wires w3<br>
and w4 joined at a junction 76b.<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 7 can be used in a procedure which employs<br>
the following steps:<br>
1. Push the combination of catheters 72a and 72b into an appropriate orifice, e.g.<br>
the anus in the case of the colon, as far as they will go.<br>
2. Advance wire w3 as far as the loop which it forms is able to travel (this is<br>
substantially the configuration shown in Figure 7).<br>
3. Pull back on both catheters so that the loop in guide wire structure 75b<br>
straightens the gut.<br>
4. Advance guide wire structure 75a in its unlooped form, i.e. wires w1 and w2,<br>
through the catheter 72a as far as it will go (which should be past the loop in guide<br>
wire structure 75b).<br>
5. Advance catheter 72a over wi and W2 so that it is ahead of catheter 72b, while<br>
catheter 72a, and the loop extending from the catheter, hold the gut in position.<br>
6. Advance guide wire W1 or guide wire w2 so that a loop is formed in guide wire<br>
structure 75a and advances in the gut.<br>
7. Withdraw whichever of wires w3 and w4 is the more forward of the two, so as<br>
to eliminate the loop in guide wire structure 75b.<br>
8. Advance catheter 72b so that it catches up with catheter 72a.<br>
The above cycle is then repeated until the desired degree of advancement has<br>
been achieved.<br>
A similar cycle of steps can be achieved by a modified form of the<br>
embodiment of Figure 7, in which one or each of the two catheters 72a and 72b is<br>
replaced by a suction catheter. A suction catheter can be used to effect the above<br>
described straightening of the gut by pulling back on it while suction is being applied.<br>
The suction is only applied during the straightening step. Yet another modification is<br>
to replace one of the guide wire structures by a soft balloon, which can be inflated to<br>
engage the gut wall, and then pulled back to straighten the gut.<br>
Many different devices can be passed over the guide wire structure, and some<br>
examples will now be given.<br>
(a) A small imager (for example a CCD or CMOS chip) on a catheter could be<br>
passed along the guide wire or guide wires to the tip. This could optionally be<br>
propelled along the guide wire by a water jet or some other means of tip propulsion to<br>
reduce the force that has to be exerted outside the patient. A source of white or<br>
coloured light could be also introduced by the same means. This source could be in<br>
the form of light emitting diodes or could use fibre-optics. One of the wires could be<br>
optionally formed out of a fiberoptic bundle. It would be easier to take the optical<br>
signal through a light-weight insulated wire which could be incorporated into the<br>
guide wire or via a separate wire in a catheter. The imager could then convert the<br>
optical information to radiowaves or microwaves, to send the information to an aerial<br>
attached to, or adjacent to, the exterior of the patient.<br>
(b) A separate soft catheter could be run over the guide wire to the tip and this<br>
could be used to introduce air from a controlled pump to inflate the viscus. Water for<br>
rinsing purposes could be passed through this catheter or through some other from a<br>
water pump.<br>
(c) A catheter could be passed over one of the guide wires, which would provide a<br>
channel through which biopsies could be performed. This is preferably done after the<br>
imager referred to in (a) above has been placed in position, so that the imager can be<br>
used to view the biopsy procedure. This catheter might have tip angulation<br>
properties.<br>
(d) A double lumen catheter could be passed over the double wire, which might<br>
allow the introduction of another wire of greater stiffness or with a curled tip to allow<br>
the movement of the device in a desired direction.<br>
Once the guide wire, and the imager referred to in (a) above, have reached the<br>
desired location, an overtube could be passed, for example to the cecum. The guide<br>
wire and the imager could then be withdrawn and a conventional endoscope could be<br>
passed through the overtube to deliver therapy, for example removing a polyp or<br>
cancer.<br>
A conventional endoscope could be introduced into a body lumen by passing it<br>
over the guide wire structure of the present invention. However, a conventional<br>
endoscope would normally be too stiff for this to be possible, and the guide wire<br>
structure of the present invention offers the possibility of, in effect, constructing an<br>
endoscope within a patient. To achieve this, a number of catheters, each providing<br>
one or more of the utilities normally provided a conventional endoscope, are<br>
successively passed over one or more of the guide wires, so that result is an<br>
assemblage of these various elements within the patient. A particular advantage of<br>
proceeding in this way is that the force required to advance each of the individual<br>
catheters is substantially less than that required to advance a complete conventional<br>
endoscope (e.g. a colonoscope or an enteroscope), since the latter is much stiffer and<br>
has much greater mass. It is therefore easier for the physician, and less uncomfortable<br>
for the patient, and is less likely to cause injury to the patient. Also, since the<br>
endoscope is then assembled element by element, the endoscope can have those<br>
facilities which are required for the particular patient, and, only those facilities, so that<br>
the endoscope is tailored to the requirements of the medical procedure being carried<br>
out. It will be understood that, for the purpose of allowing in situ assembly of a<br>
catheter, the guide wire structure should preferably comprise more than two guide<br>
wires, for example three or four guide wires.<br>
Although a structure having more than two guide wires is particularly useful<br>
for the purpose discussed above of assembling an endoscope in situ, it may also have<br>
value in relation to the procedure for introducing the guide wire structure into a<br>
lumen. This is because the two-guide wire structure shown in Figures la to lc allows<br>
curvature in only one plane, so that steering the structure in three dimensions requires<br>
the user to twist the structure about its longitudinal axis, for example by using a<br>
catheter to which the necessary torque can be applied. However, if more than two<br>
guide wires are provided it is possible to curve the structure in any plane; three guide<br>
wires are sufficient for this purpose.<br>
Attention is now directed to Figures 8a to 8c, which illustrate the use of a<br>
guide wire structure 80 which comprises two guide wires 81 and 82 connected by a<br>
junction portion 83. As can be seen, the junction portion 83 is pivotal about an axis<br>
located at the proximal end of the portion 83, so that, as shown in Figure 8a, it can<br>
pivot to such an extent that it lies flat along the distal end portion of guide wire 81.<br>
This is advantageous in that it makes possible, or makes easier, movement of the<br>
portion 83 within a catheter 84, not only where there is no loop present (as in Figure<br>
8c) but also when there is (as shown in Figure 8a). In this connection it is to be<br>
understood that the diameter of the catheter 84 would actually be substantially greater<br>
than that shown in these Figures. It is also to be understood that instead of being<br>
joined by a junction portion 83 of significant length, as illustrated, the guide wires<br>
could alternatively be joined by a junction of substantially no length, i.e. the ends of<br>
the guide wires could be connected by a junction consisting, at least in substance of<br>
just a pivot point.<br>
Figure 9 shows yet another guide wire structure in which a similar pivoting<br>
action can be achieved. This comprises guide wires 91 and 92, having respective<br>
floppy tip portions 91a and 92a connected to one another by a thread or highly<br>
flexible wire 93. This thread or wire can be inserted into the portions 91a and 92a, or<br>
attached to their surfaces.<br>
