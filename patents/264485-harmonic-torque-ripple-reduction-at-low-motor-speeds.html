				<td>HARMONIC TORQUE RIPPLE REDUCTION AT LOW MOTOR SPEEDS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to electric motor drive systems, and more particularly, embodiments<br>
of the subject matter relate to methods and apparatus for reducing torque<br>
ripple in electric motors utilized in electric and hybrid-electric vehicle drive<br>
systems.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] In vehicles using electric traction motors, alternating current (AC)<br>
motor drives are used to provide a requested torque to the motor shaft. Most<br>
motor drives attempt to provide a balanced set of purely sinusoidal currents to<br>
the motor stator windings to produce a constant torque with no distortion or<br>
ripple. However, due to practical design constraints of the AC motor, torque<br>
ripple exists even with purely sinusoidal stator current excitation. Torque<br>
ripple may cause speed ripple, excite driveline resonances, or produce other<br>
undesirable effects. In the case of a vehicle, torque ripple may produce<br>
vehicle oscillations or noise.<br>
[0003] In some situations, the torque ripple generated by a motor can be<br>
reduced by making mechanical changes to the motor design, such as the<br>
winding configuration, stator tooth geometry, rotor barrier geometry, and rotor<br>
skewing. However, there is a trade-off between torque ripple and torque<br>
density of the motor. Therefore, in all practical applications, the motor<br>
produces some torque ripple when supplied by a sinusoidal current. Passive<br>
damping methods, such as the addition of structural reinforcement or sound<br>
dampening materials to the vehicle, may be utilized to reduce some of the<br>
adverse affects of torque ripple and mitigate acoustic noise. However, these<br><br>
damping methods can be costly and do not directly address the problem of<br>
torque ripple produced by the motor.<br>
[0004] In the case of hybrid or electric vehicles, higher level supervisory<br>
controllers may employ algorithms such as active damping which attempt to<br>
modulate the torque command provided to the AC motor drive in order to<br>
minimize excitation of driveline resonances due in part to the torque ripple.<br>
However, these algorithms typically cannot operate at very low speeds, as they<br>
can not differentiate between the modulation of the driver requested torque<br>
command and oscillations induced by the torque ripple of the AC motor.<br>
Alternative techniques attempt inject a harmonic cancellation current in the<br>
fundamental synchronous frame. However, these techniques fail to address the<br>
effects of current regulator bandwidth limitations on the system, which could<br>
possibly lead to increased torque ripple.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0005] A method is provided for reducing torque ripple in an electric<br>
motor. The electric motor is coupled to an inverter, which is coupled to a<br>
current regulated control module, wherein the inverter is configured to drive<br>
the electric motor. The method comprises receiving a torque command and<br>
determining a cancellation current command based on the torque command.<br>
The method further comprises generating a harmonic cancellation command<br>
based on the cancellation current command, wherein the harmonic<br>
cancellation command is generated to compensate for a phase shift and an<br>
attenuation introduced by the current regulated control module, and providing<br>
the harmonic cancellation command to the current regulated control module,<br>
wherein the current regulated control module is configured to control the<br>
inverter in response to the harmonic cancellation command and the torque<br>
command.<br>
[0006] A method is provided for reducing torque ripple in an electric<br>
motor in response to a torque command. The electric motor is coupled to an<br>
inverter, which is coupled to a current regulated control module, wherein the<br><br>
inverter is configured to drive the electric motor. The method comprises<br>
determining a harmonic cancellation command based on the torque command,<br>
wherein the harmonic cancellation command is adjusted to compensate for a<br>
phase shift introduced by the current regulated control module, and providing<br>
the harmonic cancellation command to the current regulated control module.<br>
[00071 An apparatus is provided for a controller for reducing torque ripple<br>
in an electric motor in response to a torque command, wherein the electric<br>
motor is coupled to an inverter. The controller comprises a current regulated<br>
control module, wherein the current regulated control module generates<br>
control signals for the inverter in response to the torque command, and a<br>
harmonic cancellation command block coupled to the current regulated control<br>
module. The harmonic cancellation command block is configured to generate<br>
a harmonic cancellation command for the current regulated control module to<br>
reduce a torque ripple harmonic, wherein the harmonic cancellation command<br>
compensates for a phase shift introduced by the current regulated control<br>
module.<br>

[0031] Referring to FIG. 1, in an exemplary embodiment, an electric<br>
motor system 5 includes, without limitation: an electric motor 10, an energy<br>
source 11, an inverter 12, an electronic control system 14, a current command<br>
generator block 16, a harmonic cancellation command block 18, a summing<br>
junction 19, a current regulated control module 20, and a resolver system 22.<br>
[0032] In an exemplary embodiment, the electric motor 10 is coupled to<br>
the inverter 12 which is coupled to the energy source 11. The electronic<br>
control system 14 is coupled to the current command generator block 16 and<br>
the harmonic cancellation command block 18. The current command<br>
generator block 16 may be further coupled to the energy source 11. The<br>
output of the current command generator block 16 and output of the harmonic<br><br>
cancellation command block 18 feed the summing junction 19, which also<br>
receives an output from the current regulated control module 20. The output<br>
of the summing junction 19 is coupled to the current regulated control module<br>
20. The current regulated control module 20 may be further coupled to the<br>
electric motor 10, and it feeds the summing junction 19 to create a feedback<br>
loop. The resolver system 22 is coupled to the electric motor 10, and is further<br>
coupled to the harmonic cancellation command block 18 and the current<br>
regulated control module 20 to provide information regarding operation of the<br>
electric motor 10.<br>
[0033] In an exemplary embodiment, the electric motor 10 is a three-phase<br>
alternating current (AC) electric machine having a rotor and stator windings.<br>
In various embodiments, the electric motor 10 may be an internal permanent<br>
magnet (IPM) motor, an induction motor, a synchronous reluctance motor, or<br>
another suitable motor as will be understood. Further, it should be understood<br>
that the subject matter discussed herein is not limited to three-phase machines,<br>
and may be adapted for any number of phases. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the energy source 11 provides electrical energy and/or voltage to the inverter<br>
12 for driving the electric motor 10. The energy source 11 may comprise a<br>
battery, a fuel cell, an ultracapacitor, or any other suitable energy source<br>
known in the art. The electric motor 10 operates in response to voltage<br>
applied to the stator windings from the inverter 12, which creates torque-<br>
producing current in the stator windings. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
inverter 12 provides pulse-width modulated (PWM) voltage signals to each<br>
phase of the stator windings and may comprise a plurality of transistor switch<br>
pairs for modulating the voltage provided, as is understood in the art.<br>
(0034] In an exemplary embodiment, the electronic control system 14 may<br>
include various sensors and automotive control modules, electronic control<br>
units (ECUs), or at least one processor and/or a memory which includes<br>
instructions stored thereon (or in another computer-readable medium) for<br>
carrying out the processes and methods as described below. Although not<br>
shown, the electronic control system 14 may be coupled to additional vehicle<br><br>
components, as will be appreciated in the art. In an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the electronic control system 14 generates a torque command (T*) in response<br>
to a request for torque, and provides the torque command to the current<br>
command generator block 16 and the harmonic cancellation command block<br>
18.<br>
[0035] In an exemplary embodiment, the current command generator<br>
block 16 generates a synchronous stator current command  at a<br>
fundamental electrical frequency to operate the electric motor 10 with the<br>
commanded torque. In accordance with one embodiment, the synchronous<br>
stator current command is realized as two components relative to the d-q<br>
reference frame, discussed in greater detail below (see FIG. 2).<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the current command, s based on the<br>
torque command (T*), the energy source voltage (VDc), the angular velocity of<br>
the motor (a&gt;r), and possibly other operating parameters of the electric motor<br>
system 5. The current command generator block 16 provides the current<br>
command to the summing junction 19.<br>
[0036] In an exemplary embodiment, the harmonic cancellation command<br>
block 18 provides a second current command to the summing junction<br>
19	to cancel torque ripple harmonics in the electric motor 10 for one or more<br>
multiples of the fundamental electrical frequency. In accordance with one<br>
embodiment, the harmonic cancellation command may be realized in the d-q<br>
reference frame as discussed in greater detail below (see<br>
FIG. 2). The harmonic cancellation command block 18 is configured to<br>
perform additional tasks and functions as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0037] In an exemplary embodiment, the current regulated control module<br>
20	provides measured current feedback from the electric motor 10 to the<br>
summing junction 19. The output of the summing junction 19 is a current<br>
error command In accordance with one<br><br>
embodiment, the current regulated control module 20 generates three-phase<br>
voltage commands based on the current error command,  The current<br>
regulated control module 20 provides three-phase voltage commands to the<br>
inverter 12 to produce the commanded torque in the electric motor 10. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the current regulated control module 20 regulates the<br>
current in the electric motor 10, as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the electric<br>
motor system 5 is implemented in the d-q reference frame. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the current regulated control module 20 includes a synchronous<br>
frame current regulator 24, a synchronous to stationary transformation block<br>
26, a two to three phase transformation block 28, a three to two phase<br>
transformation block 30, and a stationary to synchronous transformation block<br>
32. The resolver system 22 includes a resolver 34 and a resolver to digital<br>
converter 36.<br>
[0039] In an exemplary embodiment, the output of the summing junction<br>
19 is coupled to the synchronous frame current regulator 24. The synchronous<br>
frame current regulator 24 is coupled to the synchronous to stationary<br>
transformation block 26, which is coupled to the two to three phase<br>
transformation block 28, which in turn is coupled to the inverter 12. The three<br>
to two phase transformation block 30 is coupled to the electric motor 10 and to<br>
the stationary to synchronous transformation block 32, which is coupled to the<br>
summing junction 19 to create a feedback loop as shown.<br>
[0040] Referring again to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
current error command is provided to the synchronous frame current regulator<br>
24. The synchronous frame current regulator 24 regulates the motor current<br>
by providing voltage commands such that the measured current in the electric<br>
motor 10 tracks the current command  The outputs of the<br>
synchronous frame current regulator 24 are intermediate voltage commands<br>
  which are processed by the synchronous to stationary<br>
transformation block 26, which uses rotor position (e.g., from the resolver<br><br>
system 22 as described below) to transform the voltage commands from the<br>
synchronous reference frame to the stationary reference frame in accordance<br>
with conventional coordinate transformation. The outputs of the synchronous<br>
to stationary transformation block 26 are the stationary frame two phase<br>
alpha/beta voltage commands The alpha/beta voltage commands<br>
are then passed to the two to three phase transformation block 28, which<br>
converts the alpha/beta voltage commands to the equivalent three-phase<br>
signals The 3-phase stationary frame voltage commands <br>
  are the operational control signals passed to the inverter 12, which<br>
processes the voltage commands and applies the commanded voltages to stator<br>
windings of the electric motor 10.<br>
[0041] In an exemplary embodiment, two (or three) stator phase currents<br>
are sensed and passed to the three to two phase transformation block 30. The<br>
three to two phase transformation block 30 converts the three phase<br>
currentsIa ,Ib and Ic to equivalent two phase alpha/beta currents la and l.<br>
The stationary to synchronous transformation block 32 transforms (using rotor<br>
position Ør which may be provided by the resolver system 22 as described<br>
below) the alpha/beta currents to synchronous frame quantities <br>
which are fed back to the summing junction 19 as shown to create a current<br>
control feedback loop. The outputs of the summing junction 19 (i.e., the<br>
current error commands) are the synchronous frame error signals, which are<br>
provided to inputs of the synchronous frame current regulator 24.<br>
[0042] In an exemplary embodiment, the resolver system 22 comprises a<br>
resolver 34 coupled to the electric motor 10. The output of the resolver 34 is<br>
coupled to a resolver to digital converter 36. The resolver to digital converter<br>
36 generates a digital representation of the rotor position, which is provided to<br>
the synchronous to stationary transformation block 26, the stationary to<br>
synchronous transformation block 32, and the harmonic cancellation<br>
command block 18.<br><br>
(0043] Referring again to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
resolver system 22 measures the rotor position (Ør) and the motor speed (nr)<br>
and provides the measured values to other system components. The resolver<br>
34 (or similar speed sensing device) senses the position of the rotor and,<br>
thereby, derives the speed of the electric motor 10. The resolver to digital<br>
converter 36 converts the signals from the resolver 34 to digital signals (e.g., a<br>
digital motor speed signal and a digital rotor angular position signal), as is<br>
understood in the art. The resolver system 22 may provide digital<br>
representations of rotor position and motor speed to the harmonic cancellation<br>
command block 18, the current regulated control module 20, and/or other<br>
system components as described herein.<br>
[0044] For the implementation depicted in FIG. 2, the harmonic<br>
cancellation command block 18 generates in response to the<br>
torque command and other system parameters. Both outputs of the harmonic<br>
cancellation control block 18 are fed to the summing junction 19. Thus, the<br>
harmonic cancellation control block 18 influences the operation of the current<br>
regulated control module 20.<br>
[0045] Referring again to FIG. 2, the current control feedback loop<br>
introduces a bandwidth frequency limitation (i.e., a cutoff frequency) to the<br>
frequency response of the current regulated control module 20. The<br>
bandwidth frequency (fbW) is governed in part by the maximum switching<br>
frequency of the PWM inverter 12 and sampling rate of the electric motor<br>
system 5, which are two factors limiting the achievable bandwidth of the<br>
current regulated control module 20. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
bandwidth frequency may range from 300-500 Hz, although in other<br>
embodiments, the bandwidth frequency may be 1 kHz or greater. The<br>
bandwidth limitation of the current regulated control module 20 introduces<br>
attenuation and phase shift which affects the current regulated control module<br>
20 frequency response. This limits the ability of the synchronous frame<br><br>
current regulator 24 to faithfully track the harmonic cancellation command<br>
when the command frequencies approach or exceed fbw.<br>
[00461 Referring now to FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment,<br>
the harmonic cancellation command block 18 generates a harmonic<br>
cancellation command,  , to reduce torque ripple caused by an identified<br>
ripple harmonic, H. In an exemplary embodiment, the harmonic cancellation<br>
command block 18 includes, without limitation: a cancellation current<br>
command block 38, a magnitude compensation block 40, a phase<br>
compensation block 42, a deactivation block 44, and a rectangular conversion<br>
block 46. The harmonic cancellation command block 18 may receive as<br>
inputs a torque command (T*), rotor position (Ør ),motor speed (nr), electrical<br>
angular velocity (ωe = 2πfe), current regulator bandwidth (ωbw), and/or the<br>
ripple harmonic to be cancelled (H). As shown in FIG. 4, the harmonic<br>
cancellation command block 18 may be realized and/or implemented in the d-<br>
q reference frame.<br>
[0047] In the illustrated embodiment, the cancellation current command<br>
block 38 is coupled to the magnitude compensation block 40 and the phase<br>
compensation block 42. The output of the magnitude compensation block 40<br>
is coupled to the input of the deactivation block 44. The output of the<br>
deactivation block 44 and the output of the phase compensation block 42 are<br>
coupled to the rectangular conversion block 46. As shown in FIG. 2, the<br>
output of the rectangular conversion block 46 is coupled to the summing<br>
junction 19. In an exemplary embodiment, the magnitude compensation block<br>
40 compensates for the attenuation of the current regulated control module 20<br>
and the phase compensation block 42 compensates for the phase shift of the<br>
current regulated control module 20, as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0048] Referring now to FIG. 5, in an exemplary embodiment, tne<br>
harmonic cancellation command block may be configured to perform a torque<br>
ripple reduction process 500 and additional tasks, functions, and operations<br>
described below. The various tasks may be performed by software, hardware,<br><br>
firmware, or any combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following<br>
description may refer to elements mentioned above in connection with FIGS.<br>
1-4. In practice, the tasks, functions, and operations may be performed by<br>
different elements of the described system. It should be appreciated any<br>
number of additional or alternative tasks may be included, and may be<br>
incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or process having<br>
additional functionality not described in detail herein.<br>
[0049] Referring again to FIG. 5, and with continued reference to FIG. 3<br>
and FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment, a ripple harmonic to be cancelled is<br>
identified, H (task 502). In accordance with one embodiment, H is an integer<br>
multiple representing a harmonic of the fundamental electrical frequency that<br>
causes torque ripple. In an exemplary embodiment, the ripple harmonic may<br>
be predetermined based on motor operating characteristics and preconfigured<br>
in the harmonic cancellation command block 18. In accordance with another<br>
embodiment, the ripple harmonic may be produced external to the harmonic<br>
cancellation command block 18 (i.e., provided to the harmonic cancellation<br>
command block 18 from the electronic control system or another vehicle<br>
control module). In an exemplary embodiment, the harmonic cancellation<br>
command block 18 generates the harmonic cancellation command based on<br>
the identified ripple harmonic.<br>
[0050] In an exemplary embodiment, the harmonic cancellation command<br>
block is configured to receive a torque command, T* (task 504). The torque<br>
command may be provided to the cancellation current command block 38<br>
from the electronic control system or another control module within a vehicle<br>
in response to a user request for torque (i.e., a driver of a vehicle depressing an<br>
accelerator pedal).<br>
[0051] In an exemplary embodiment, the cancellation current command<br>
block 38 determines a cancellation current command based on the torque<br>
command (task 506). The cancellation current command block 38 provides a<br>
cancellation current command for the harmonic frequency (H*fe) based on the<br>
torque command and predetermined torque characteristics of the electric<br><br>
motor. The torque ripple characteristics of the electric motor are a complex<br>
function of the motor design, including stator and rotor lamination geometry<br>
and the winding configuration. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
predetermined torque characteristics may be determined either empirically, or<br>
by finite element analysis (FEA). In accordance with one embodiment, the<br>
cancellation current command block 38 determines the cancellation current<br>
command by obtaining the cancellation current command from a lookup table<br>
39 containing stored current cancellation commands corresponding to a range<br>
of possible input torque commands. In another embodiment, the cancellation<br>
current command block 38 may determine the cancellation current command<br>
by performing a polynomial curve fitting operation on the torque command.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, the cancellation current command is a polar<br>
quantity having a magnitude (M) and a cancellation phase angle (Ø), as<br>
labeled in FIG. 4.<br>
[0052] In an exemplary embodiment, the harmonic cancellation command<br>
block 18 generates the harmonic cancellation command by modifying the<br>
magnitude of the cancellation current command based on the identified ripple<br>
harmonic frequency to compensate for the attenuation of the current regulated<br>
control module (task 508). The current regulated control module may be<br>
modeled as a single pole low pass filter, with a pole at the bandwidth<br>
frequency   wherein the gain of the current regulator has a<br>
frequency response   Accordingly, the attenuation<br>
increases (or the magnitude of the gain decreases) as command frequencies<br>
provided to the current regulated control module increase (i.e., ω -» ωbw ). In<br>
an exemplary embodiment, to compensate for attenuation, the magnitude<br>
compensation block 40 generates an adjusted magnitude (M') by multiplying<br>
the magnitude by a compensating factor, such that <br><br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the magnitude compensation block 40 may include a gain<br>
compensation operation block 41 coupled to a first multiplier 43 which<br>
receives the cancellation current command magnitude Mas an input. The gain<br>
compensation operation block 41 evaluates  and provides the<br>
result to a first multiplier 43 to produce M'. In accordance with one<br>
embodiment, the bandwidth frequency of the current regulated control module<br>
may be predetermined and the magnitude compensation block 40 may be<br>
preconfigured accordingly.<br>
[0053] In an exemplary embodiment, the harmonic cancellation command<br>
block 18 generates the harmonic cancellation command by modifying the<br>
cancellation phase angle to compensate for the phase shift of the current<br>
regulated control module (task 510). As discussed above, the current<br>
regulated control module may be modeled as a single pole low pass filter, with<br>
a pole at the bandwidth frequency such that the phase shift of<br>
the current regulated control module is governed by <br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the phase compensation block 42 may include a phase<br>
correction block 45 which evaluates tar  to produce y.<br>
Additionally, the location of the identified ripple harmonic must be accounted<br>
for by adding a harmonic phase angle corresponding to the harmonic position,<br>
governed by , which may be generated by a second multiplier 47. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the phase compensation block 42 modifies the<br>
cancellation phase angle by adding a compensating phase shift and a harmonic<br>
phase angle, wherein the harmonic cancellation phase angle is governed by<br><br>
[0054] Referring again to FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
deactivation block 44 is configured to disable the harmonic cancellation<br>
command if the motor speed is greater than a threshold speed I (task<br><br>
512, 514). In this regard, the deactivation block 44 may be implemented with<br>
a scaling factor block 49 and a third multiplier 51 which receives M' as an<br>
input. The scaling factor block 49 calculates a scaling factor dn which is<br>
provided to the third multiplier 51 to disable the harmonic cancellation<br>
command as speed increases. As the speed increases, the fundamental<br>
electrical frequency increases (fe), which causes the frequency of the harmonic<br>
cancellation command (i.e., Hxfe) to approach the switching frequency of<br>
the inverter. At some point the ratio of the harmonic frequency to the<br>
switching frequency reaches a level where the harmonic cancellation<br>
command is no longer effective because of pulse ratio (ratio of the harmonic<br>
frequency to the output PWM frequency) restrictions. Accordingly, the<br>
harmonic cancellation command is deactivated as speed increases.<br>
[0055] In an exemplary embodiment, the resolver system 22 may provide<br>
the motor speed, nr to the deactivation block 44. In alternative embodiments,<br>
the motor speed may be calculated based on , where p is the<br>
number of poles in the electric motor. In an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
magnitude of the harmonic cancellation command is modified by multiplying<br>
the adjusted magnitude by a scaling factor to smoothly disable the harmonic<br>
cancellation command between a first speed (n1) and the threshold speed. For<br>
example, the scaling factor dn may linearly vary from 1 at speed n1 to 0 at<br>
speed nth (and speeds thereafter), such that for <br>
[0056] In an exemplary embodiment, the rectangular conversion block 46<br>
converts the harmonic cancellation command from a polar quantity (having<br>
magnitude  to a rectangular quantity (task 516). In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the rectangular conversion block 46 generates the<br>
harmonic cancellation command in the d-q synchronous reference frame,<br>
wherein  . Referring to FIG. 4, the<br>
rectangular conversion block 46 may be realized as sine operator block 53, a<br>
cosine operator block 55, a fourth multiplier 57 and a fifth multiplier 59. The<br><br>
sine operator block 53 and cosine operator block 55 each receive the harmonic<br>
cancellation phase angle ø' and perform the sine and cosine function of ø',<br>
respectively. The fourth multiplier 57 receives the output of the sine operator<br>
block 53 and M" as inputs and produces   The fifth multiplier 59<br>
receives the output of the cosine operator block 55 and M" as inputs and<br>
produces  The harmonic cancellation command block provides the<br>
harmonic cancellation command to the current regulated control module via<br>
the summing junction 19 (task 518). The torque ripple reduction process 500<br>
operates continually and the loop defined by tasks 504, 506, 508, 510, 512,<br>
514, 516, and 518 may repeat and respond to changes within the system, for<br>
example, changes to the torque command, T*, or the rotor position.<br>
[00571 Referring now to FIGS. 6-11, for an exemplary case, when the<br>
harmonic cancellation command block is not active and a sinusoidal current<br>
shown in FIG. 6 is provided to the motor, the motor torque exhibits a ripple<br>
component as shown in FIG. 7. FIG. 8 illustrates a fast Fourier transform<br>
(FFT) of the torque ripple in FIG. 7 which reveals torque ripple produced by a<br>
dominant harmonic of the fundamental electrical frequency corresponding to<br>
the 12th harmonic. As shown in FIG. 9, when the harmonic cancellation<br>
command block is enabled with H-12, the current provided to the motor is<br>
distorted rather than purely sinusoidal as a result of the harmonic cancellation<br>
current provided to the current regulated control module. In response to the<br>
harmonic cancellation command, the motor produces a smoother torque and<br>
torque ripple oscillations are notably reduced as shown in FIG. 10. As shown<br>
in FIG. 11, an FFT of the motor torque in FIG. 10 reveals the harmonic<br>
cancellation command block with H=\2 effectively cancels the 12th harmonic.<br>
[0058] It should be understood that the exemplary embodiment shown is<br>
solely for the purpose of illustration, and the electric motor system may be<br>
adapted to include additional harmonic cancellation command blocks, or the<br>
harmonic cancellation command block may be adapted (i.e., by replicating the<br>
individual component blocks) in order to target additional harmonics and<br><br>
further reduce the torque ripple. Thus, in alternative embodiments, one or<br>
more harmonic cancellation command blocks may be utilized to generate<br>
commands to cancel multiple harmonics.<br>
[0059] One advantage of the methods and/or systems described above is<br>
that the electric motor system produces a smoother torque at low motor<br>
speeds. Furthermore, compensating, for the attenuation and phase shift<br>
introduced by the current regulated control module allows the harmonic<br>
cancellation command to be faithfully tracked by the synchronous frame<br>
current regulator as the fundamental electrical frequency increases. Other<br>
embodiments may utilize the systems and methods described above in<br>
different types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and aircraft),<br>
or in different mechanical systems altogether, as it may be implemented in any<br>
situation where torque ripple harmonics exist.<br>
[0060] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>

of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br>

the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
