FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the manufacture of mesoporous Zirconium compounds<br>
and in particular to the manufacture of cost effective mesoporous zirconia-silica<br>
composite and mesoporous zirconium phosphate involving cost effective inorganic<br>
ingredients. The process is commercially viable and favour cost effective and large scale<br>
production of such zirconium composites. Importantly the mesoporous zirconium<br>
composite of the invention is directed for application / use in catalyst bed and as<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known to provide mesoporous zirconium composites involving silicate and<br>
phosphate material with selective porosity for variety of end use / application including<br>
chemical, optical, biological and electronic industry.<br>
In providing such mesoporous composites it is an important consideration that<br>
fictionalization is enhanced for its variety of end use/applications.<br>
Usually in the synthesis of mesoporous zirconia-silica composite and mesoporous<br>
zirconium phosphates generally metal alkoxides are used which are however very costly<br>
and therefore synthesis routes involving the same are not commercial viable.<br>
It is also known to synthesis mesoporous SIO2 - ZrO2 composite through sol-gel method<br>
using TEOS as a source of silica and also the gelling agent. In such process Zlrconyl<br>
nitrate dihydrate is used as a zirconium source. In this method, after preparation of the<br>
gel through add catalyzed reaction, the gel obtalned was aged. Subsequently<br>
mesoporous SiO2 - ZrO2 was obtalned after super critical gel drying. The use of<br>
tetraethoxysilane and zirconium n - propoxfde, mesoporous SiO2 - ZrO2 composite is<br>
also reported.<br>
As a further variety synthesis of mesoporous zirconium phosphate through sol-gel<br>
technique using zirconium alkoxide as precursor is also known. In this process,<br>
hydrolyzing of the alkoxide in the presence of ortho-phosphoric add and cationic<br>
surfactant to produce a solid mass which on leaching / caldning formed mesoporous<br>
zirconium phosphate is also known.<br><br>
While the above reveals the avallable knowledge in the art to produce the mesoporous<br>
composites, such process however are found to be either complex and/or cost extensive-<br>
It should thus be apparent that there is considerable advancement by ways to<br>
fictionalize mesoporous silicate structures. One of the major concerns in such<br>
manufacture of mesoporous composites Is the need to provide selected, functional sites<br>
in a number of locations within the structural network. Moreover, the flctlonalizatlon<br>
processes should be generally compatible with avallable techniques for making such<br>
mesoporous structures. For example, they should not add excessive cost to the overall<br>
manufacturing operations. Furthermore, it would be helpful if the new processes<br>
generally malntalned the physical integrity of the mesoporous structure.<br>
The pore size distribution obtalned from surface area analysis was comparable with<br>
alkoxides route indicating very good quality of the materials. In general such<br>
characteristics are hardly obtalned by such cost effective procedure.<br>
Importantly while the commercial source of mesoporous zirconia is zirconyl oxychloride<br>
which is a cost effective source to produce mesoporous zirconia with broad range of pore<br>
size distribution through precipitation, it has been difficult to produce mesoporous<br>
zirconium composites involving such cost effective sources. This is because in case of<br>
mesoporous SIO2 - ZrO2 composite, if sodium silicate and zirconyl oxychloride are used,<br>
instantaneous inhomogeneous precipitation takes place which hinder the formation of<br>
mesoporous compound or decreased its quality. In contrast with these traditional<br>
techniques, the solution sol-gel method (SSG) allows excellent control of the properties<br>
of the products. The SSG method, comprised of controlled hydrolysis and subsequent<br>
condensation of metal alkoxides, normally yield a homogeneous distribution of all the<br>
components at a molecular level, high surface area and adjustable pore size distribution.<br>
The same problem is experienced for zirconium Phosphate also. Though precipitation<br>
occurs here but the process is very slow and the homogeneity of the retalned compared<br>
to other non sol-gel methods. Thus in spite of the well known wide applications /uses of<br>
mesoporous composites the reliance on cost extensive sources of its manufacture make<br>
its obtalning commercially not viable to the desired extent There is thus a continuing<br>
need in the art to develop methods of producing such mesoporous composites cost<br>
effectively involving cost-effective sources.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for a method of<br>
manufacture of mesoporous zirconium composite such as mesoporous zirconium<br><br>
phosphate and ZrO2-SiO2 -composite involving cost effective inorganic ingredients as an<br>

cheapest way.<br>

production of such zirconium composites. Importantly the mesoporous zirconium<br>
composite of the invention is directed for application / use in catalyst bed and as<br>
mesoporous molecular sieve.<br></td>
