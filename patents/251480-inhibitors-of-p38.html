				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to inhibitors of<br>
p38, a mammalian protein kinase involved in cell<br>
proliferation, cell death and response to extracellular<br>
stimuli. The invention also relates to methods for<br>
producing these inhibitors. The invention also provides<br>
pharmaceutical compositions comprising the inhibitors of<br>
the invention and methods of utilizing those compositions<br>
in the treatment and prevention of various disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Protein kinases are involved in various<br>
cellular responses to extracellular signals. Recently, a<br>
family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) has<br>
been discovered. Members of this family are Ser/Thr<br>
kinases that activate their substrates by phosphorylation<br>
[B. Stein et al., Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., 31, pp. 289-98<br>
(1996)]. MAPKs are themselves activated by a variety of<br>
signals including growth factors, cytokines, UV<br>
radiation, and stress-inducing agents.<br>
One particularly interesting MAPK is p38. p38,<br>
also known as cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drug<br>
binding protein (CSBP) and RK, was isolated from murine<br>
pre-B cells that were transfected with the<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor, CD14, and induced with<br>
LPS. p38 has since been isolated and sequenced, as has<br>
the cDNA encoding it in humans and mouse. Activation of<br>
p38 has been observed in cells stimulated by stress, such<br>
as treatment of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), UV,<br><br>
anisomycin, or osmotic shock, and by cytokines, such as<br>
IL-1 and TNF.<br>
Inhibition of p38 kinase leads to a blockade on<br>
the production of both IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF<br>
stimulate the production of other proinflammatory<br>
cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 and have been implicated<br>
in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and in post-<br>
menopausal osteoporosis [R. B. Kimble et al.,<br>
Endocrinol., 136, pp. 3054-61 (1995)].<br>
Based upon this finding, it is believed that<br>
p38, along with other MAPKs, have a role in mediating<br>
cellular response to inflammatory stimuli, such as<br>
leukocyte accumulation, macrophage/monocyte activation,<br>
tissue resorption, fever, acute phase responses and<br>
neutrophilia. In addition, MAPKs, such as p38, have been<br>
implicated in cancer, thrombin-induced platelet<br>
aggregation, immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune<br>
diseases, cell death, allergies, osteoporosis and<br>
neurodegenerative disorders. Inhibitors of p38 have also<br>
been implicated in the area of pain management through<br>
inhibition of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2<br>
induction. Other diseases associated with 11-1, IL-6,<br>
IL-8 or TNF overproduction are set forth in WO 96/21654.<br>
Others have already begun trying to develop<br>
drugs that specifically inhibit MAPKs. For example, PCT<br>
publication WO 95/31451 describes pyrazole compounds that<br>
inhibit MAPKs, and, in particular, p38. However, the<br>
efficacy of these inhibitors in vivo is still being<br>
investigated.<br>
Accordingly, there is still a great need to<br>
develop other potent inhibitors of p38, including p38-<br><br>
specific inhibitors, that are useful in treating various<br>
conditions associated with p38 activation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

-C(O)-OR or -C(O)R wherein two adjacent R are optionally<br>
bound to one another and, together with each Y to which<br>
they are respectively bound, form a 4-8 membered<br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring.<br>
When the two R components form a ring together<br>
with the Y components to which they are respectively<br>
bound, it will obvious to those skilled in the art that a<br>
terminal hydrogen from each unfused R component will be<br>
lost. For example, if a ring structure is formed by<br>
binding those two R components together, one being -NH-<br>
CH3 and the other being -CH2-CH3, one terminal hydrogen on<br>

According to another embodiment, the present<br>
invention provides methods of producing the above-<br>
identified inhibitors of p38 of the formulae (la), (lb),<br>
(Ic), (Id) and (Ie). Representative synthesis schemes<br>
for formula (la) are depicted below.<br>
Schemes 1-3 illustrate the preparation of<br>
compounds in which W is either an amino, carboxyl or an<br>
aldehyde function. In each case the particular moiety<br>
may be modified through chemistry well known in the<br>
literature. For example the final amino compounds D and<br>
N (schemes 1 and 4 respectively) may be acylated,<br>
sulfonylated or alkylated to prepare compounds within the<br>
scope of W. In all schemes, the LI and L2 groups on the<br>
initial materials are meant to represent leaving groups<br><br>
ortho to the nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring. For<br>
example, compound A may be 2, 6-dichloro-3 nitro pyridine.<br><br>
In Scheme 1, W is selected from amino-<br>
derivatized compounds such as N (R1) SO2-N(R2)2; N(R2)SO2-<br>
N(R')(R3); N(R2)C(O)-OR2; N (R2) C (O) -N (R2) 2; N(R2)C(O)-<br>
N(R')(R3); N(R2)C(O)-R2; or N(R2)2.<br>
In Scheme 1, the Q2 ring is introduced<br>
utilizing one of many reactions know in the art which<br>
result in the production of biaryl compounds. One<br>
example may be the reaction of an aryl lithium compound<br>
with the pyridine intermediate A. Alternatively, an<br>
arylmetalic compound such as an aryl stannane or an aryl<br>
boronic acid may be reacted with the aryl halide portion<br>
(intermediate A) in the presence of a Pdo catalyst to<br>
form product B. In the next step, a Ql substituted<br>
derivative such as a phenyl acetonitrile derivative may<br>
be created with a base such as sodium hydride, sodium<br>
amide, LDA, lithium hexamethyldisilazide or any number of<br><br>
other non-nucleophilic bases to deprotonate the position<br>
alpha to the cyano group, which represents a masked amide<br>
moiety. This anion is then contacted with intermediate B<br>
to form C. The nitrile or equivalent group of<br>
intermediate C is then hydrolyzed to form the amide and<br>
the nitro group is subjected to reducing conditions to<br>
form the amine intermediate D. Intermediate D is then<br>
used to introduce various functionality defined by W<br>
through chemistry such as acylation, sulfonylation or<br>
alkylation reactions well known in the literature.<br>
Depending on the regiochemistry of the first two steps of<br>
this procedure, the first two steps may need to be<br>
reversed.<br><br>
In Scheme 2, W is selected from carboxyl-derivatized<br>
compounds such as C(O)-R2; CH(OH)-R2; C (O) -N (R2) 2; or C(O)-<br>
OR; .<br>
Scheme 2 generally follows the procedures<br>
described for Scheme 1 except that a carboxyl<br><br>
intermediate such as E is the starting material. The<br>
first two steps mirror Scheme 1, and, as mentioned for<br>
Scheme 1, may be reversed depending on the regiochemistry<br>
of specific examples. Intermediate G is formed from<br>
these first two steps and this material may be hydrolyzed<br>
as mention to for the carboxyl intermediate H. The<br>
carboxyl group may then be modified according to well-<br>
known procedures from the literature to prepare analogs<br>
with defined W substituents such as acylations,<br>
amidations and esterifications.<br><br>
In Scheme 3, W is selected from (C1-C4) straight<br>
or branched alkyl optionally substituted with N(R');., OR',<br>
CO2R', CON(R');., R3, or SO2N(R2)2; or a 5-6 membered<br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system optionally<br>
substituted with N(R')2, OR', CO2R' , CON(R')2, or<br>
SOzN(R2)z; provided that W is not an R3 substituted C,<br>
alkyl.<br><br>
In scheme 3 a pyridine derivative is metalated<br>
and quenched with one of many known electrophiles which<br>
can generate an aldehyde, to form intermediate I. The<br>
aldehyde can then be masked to form the dimethyl acetal<br>
J. This intermediate is then carried on as described in<br>
scheme 1 and 2 to introduce the Ql and Q2 substituents,<br>
to produce intermediate L. As before, these two steps<br>
may be interchanged depending on specific regiochemistry.<br>
The masked aldehyde of L may then be deprotected and<br>
utilized to form compounds with the defined W<br>
substitution using well know chemistry such as<br>
alkylations and reductive aminations.<br>
Schemes 4-6 are similar to schemes 1-3 with the<br>
exception that the targeted compounds are those :.n which<br>
Z = Nitrogen. The steps for these schemes parallel 1-3<br>
with the exception that the alkylation utilizing a phenyl<br>
acetonitrile is replaced with a reaction with a Ql amine<br>
derivative such as a substituted aniline derivative. The<br>
amide portion of the molecule is then introduced in an<br>
acylation reaction with, for example, chlorosulfonyl<br><br><br>
In Scheme 4, W is selected from amino-<br>
derivatized groups such as N (R2) SO2-N (R2) 2; N(R2)SO2-<br>
N(R2)(R3); N(R2)C(O)-OR2; N (Rz) C (0) -N (R2) 2; N(R2)C(O)-<br>
N(R2)(R3); N(R2)C(O)-R2; or N(R2)2.<br>
In Scheme 4, intermediate B (from scheme 1) is<br>
treated with, for example, an aniline derivative in the<br>
presence of a base such as potassium carbonate.<br>
Additionally, a palladium catalyst may be utilized to<br>
enhance the reactivity of this general type of reaction,<br>
if needed. The resulting amine derivative is then<br>
acylated to form intermediate M. The nitro group of M is<br>
then reduced to form N and the amino group may then be<br>
derivatized as described for scheme 1. As mentioned for<br>
schemes 1-3, the steps involved in the introduction of<br>
the Ql and Q2 substituents may be interchanged depending<br>
on the specific regiochemistry of specific compounds.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 5, W is selected from carboxyl-derivatized<br>
groups such as C(O)-R2; CH(OH)-R2; C(O)-N(R2)2; or C(O)-<br>
OR2.<br><br><br>
In Scheme 6, W is selected from (C1-C4) straight<br>
or branched alkyl optionally substituted with N(R')2/ OR',<br>
CO2R', CON(R')2, R3, or SO2N(R2)2; or a 5-6 membered<br>
carbocyclic or heterocyclic ring system optionally<br>
substituted with N(R')2, OR', CO2R', CON(R')2, or<br>
SO2N(R1)2; provided that W is not an R3 substituted C2<br>
alkyl.<br>
Schemes 5 and 6 generally follow the procedures<br>
mentioned above.<br>
One having skill in the art will recognize<br>
schemes 1-6 may be used to synthesize compounds having<br>
the general formula of (Ib), (Ic), (Id) and (Ie).<br>
According to another embodiment of the<br>
invention, the activity of the p38 inhibitors of this<br>
invention may be assayed in vitro, in vivo or in a cell<br>
line. In vitro assays include assays that determine<br>
inhibition of either the kinase activity or ATPase<br>
activity of activated p38. Alternate in vitro assays<br>
quantitate the ability of the inhibitor to bind to p38<br>
and may be measured either by radiolabelling the<br>
inhibitor prior to binding, isolating the inhibitor/p38<br>
complex and determining the amount of radiolabel bound,<br>
or by running a competition experiment where new<br>
inhibitors are incubated with p38 bound to known<br>
radioligands.<br>
Cell culture assays of the inhibitory effect of<br>
the compounds of this invention may determine the amounts<br>
of TNF, IL-1, IL-6 or IL-8 produced in whole blood or<br>
cell fractions thereof in cells treated with inhibitor as<br>
compared to cells treated with negative controls. Level<br>
of these cytokines may be determined through the use of<br>
commercially available ELISAs.<br><br>
An in vivo assay useful for determining the<br>
inhibitory activity of the p38 inhibitors of this<br>
invention are the suppression of hind paw edema in rats<br>
with Mycobacterium butyricum-induced adjuvant arthritis.<br>
This is described in J.C. Boehm et al., J. Med. Chem.,<br>
39, pp. 3929-37 (1996), the disclosure of which is herein<br>
incorporated by reference. The p38 inhibitors of this<br>
invention may also be assayed in animal models of<br>
arthritis, bone resorption, endotoxin shock and immune<br>
function, as described in A. M. Badger et al., J.<br>
Pharmacol. Experimental Therapeutics, 279, pp. 1453-61<br>
(1996), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
The p38 inhibitors or pharmaceutical salts<br>
thereof may be formulated into pharmaceutical<br>
compositions for administration to animals or humans.<br>
These pharmaceutical compositions, which comprise an<br>
amount of p38 inhibitor effective to treat or prevent a<br>
p38-mediated condition and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, are another embodiment of the present invention.<br>

The compositions of the present invention may<br>
be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation<br>
spray, topically, rectally, nasally, buccally, vaginally<br>
or via an implanted reservoir. The term "parenteral" as<br>
used herein includes subcutaneous, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular, intra-articular, intra-synovial,<br>
intrasternal, intrathecal, intrahepatic, intralesional<br><br>
and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
Preferably, the compositions are administered orally,<br>
intraperitoneally or intravenously.<br>
Sterile injectable forms of the compositions of<br>
this invention may be aqueous or oleaginous suspension.<br>
These suspensions may be formulated according to<br>
techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile<br>
injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable<br>
solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-<br>
acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution<br>
in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's<br>
solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In<br>
addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed<br>
as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any<br>
bland fixed oil may be employed, including synthetic mono-<br>
or di-glycerides. Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and<br>
its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation<br>
of injectables, as are natural pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil,<br>
especially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil<br>
solutions or suspensions may also contain a long-chain<br>
alcohol diluent or dispersant, such as carboxymethyl<br>
cellulose or similar dispersing agents which are commonly<br>
used in the formulation of pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
dosage forms including emulsions and suspensions. Other<br>
commonly used surfactants, such as Tweens, Spans and<br>
other emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers<br>
which are commonly used in the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solid, liquid, or other<br><br>
dosage forms may also be used for the purposes of<br>
formulation.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may be orally administered in any orally<br>
acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to,<br>
capsules, tablets, aqueous suspensions or solutions. In<br>
the case of tablets for oral use, carriers commonly used<br>
include lactose and corn starch. Lubricating agents,<br>
such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added.<br>
For oral administration in a capsule form, useful<br>
diluents include lactose and dried cornstarch. When<br>
aqueous suspensions are required for oral use, the active<br>
ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending<br>
agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring or<br>
coloring agents may also be added.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention may be administered in the form of<br>
suppositories for rectal administration. These can be<br>
prepared by mixing the agent with a suitable non-<br>
irritating excipient which is solid at room temperature<br>
but liquid at rectal temperature and therefore will melt<br>
in the rectum to release the drug. Such materials<br>
include cocoa butter, beeswax and polyethylene glycols.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered topically, especially<br>
when the target of treatment includes areas or organs<br>
readily accessible by topical application, including<br>
diseases of the eye, the skin, or the lower intestinal<br>
tract. Suitable topical formulations are readily<br>
prepared for each of these areas or organs.<br>
Topical application fcr the lower intestinal<br>
tract can be effected in a rectal suppository formulation<br><br>
(see above) or in a suitable enema formulation.<br>
Topically-transdermal patches may also be used.<br>
For topical applications, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated in a suitable ointment<br>
containing the active component suspended or dissolved in<br>
one or more carriers. Carriers for topical<br>
administration of the compounds of this invention<br>
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, liquid<br>
petrolatμM, white petrolatμM, propylene glycol,<br>
polyoxyethylene, polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying<br>
wax and water. Alternatively, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can be formulated in a suitable lotion or<br>
cream containing the active components suspended or<br>
dissolved in one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. Suitable carriers include, but are not limited<br>
to, mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, polysorbate 60,<br>
cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol,<br>
benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
For ophthalmic use, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions may be formulated as micronized suspensions<br>
in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline, or, preferably,<br>
as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted sterile saline,<br>
either with or without a preservative such as<br>
benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, for ophthalmic<br>
uses, the pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated<br>
in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention may also be administered by nasal aerosol or<br>
inhalation. Such compositions are prepared according to<br>
techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives,<br><br>
absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability,<br>
fluorocarbons, and/or other conventional solubilizing or<br>
dispersing agents.<br>
The amount of p38 inhibitor that may be<br>
combined with the carrier materials to produce a single<br>
dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated,<br>
the particular mode of administration. Preferably, the<br>
compositions should be formulated so that a dosage of<br>
between 0.01 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day of the inhibitor<br>
can be administered to a patient receiving these<br>
compositions.<br>
It should also be understood that a specific<br>
dosage and treatment regimen for any particular patient<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors, including the<br>
activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body<br>
weight, general health, sex, diet, time of<br>
administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, and<br>
the judgment of the treating physician and the severity<br>
of the particular disease being treated. The amount of<br>
inhibitor will also depend upon the particular compound<br>
in the composition.<br>
According to another embodiment, the invention<br>
provides methods for treating or preventing a p38-<br>
mediated condition comprising the step of administering<br>
to a patient one of the above-described pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. The term "patient", as used herein, means<br>
an animal, preferably a human.<br>
Preferably, that method is used to treat or<br>
prevent a condition selected from inflammatory diseases,<br>
autoimmune diseases, destructive bone disorders,<br>
proliferative disorders, infectious diseases,<br>
degenerative diseases, allergies, reperfusion/ischemia in<br><br>
stroke, heart attacks, angiogenic disorders, organ<br>
hypoxia, vascular hyperplasia, cardiac hypertrophy, and<br>
thrombin-induced platelet aggregation.<br>
According to another embodiment, the inhibitors<br>
of this invention are used to treat or prevent an IL-1,<br>
IL-6, IL-8 or TNF-mediated disease or condition. Such<br>
conditions are described above.<br>
Depending upon the particular p38-mediated<br>
condition to be treated or prevented, additional drugs,<br>
which are normally administered to treat or prevent that<br>
condition, may be administered together with the<br>
inhibitors of this invention. For example,<br>
chemotherapeutic agents or other anti-proliferative<br>
agents may be combined with the p38 inhibitors of this<br>
invention to treat proliferative diseases.<br>
Those additional agents may be administered<br>
separately, as part of a multiple dosage regimen, from<br>
the p38 inhibitor-containing composition. Alternatively,<br>
those agents may be part of a single dosage form, mixed<br>
together with the p38 inhibitor in a single composition.<br>
In order that the invention described herein<br>
may be more fully understood, the following examples are<br>
set forth. It should be understood that these examples<br>
are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be<br>
construed as limiting this invention in any manner.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
Cloning of p38 Kinase in Insect Cells<br>
Two splice variants of human p38 kinase, CSBP1<br>
and CSBP2, have been identified. Specific<br>
oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify the coding<br>
region of CSBP2 cDNA using a HeLa cell library<br>
(Stratagene) as a template. The polymerase chain<br>
reaction product was cloned into the pET-15b vector<br>
(Novagen). The baculovirus transfer vector, pVL-(His)6-<br>
p38 was constructed by subcloning a Xbal-BamEI fragment<br>
of pET15b-(His)6-p38 into the complementary sites in<br>
plasmid pVL1392 (Pharmingen).<br>
The plasmid pVL-(His)6-p38 directed the<br>
synthesis of a recombinant protein consisting of a 23-<br>
residue peptide (MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMLE, where LVPRGS<br>
represents a thrombin cleavage site) fused in frame to<br>
the N-terminus of p38, as confirmed by DNA sequencing and<br>
by N-terminal sequencing of the expressed protein.<br>
Monolayer culture of Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect<br>
cells (ATCC) was maintained in TNM-FH medium (Gibco BRL)<br>
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a T-flask at<br>
27C'C. Sf9 cells in log phase were co-transfected with<br>
linear viral DNA of Autographs califonica nuclear<br>
polyhedrosis virus (Pharmingen) and transfer vector pVL-<br>
(His)6-p38 using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). The individual<br><br>
recombinant baculovirus clones were purified by plaque<br>
assay using It low melting agarose.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Expression and Purification of Recombinant p38 Kinase<br>
Trichoplusia ni (Tn-368) High-Five™ cells<br>
(Invitrogen) were grown in suspension in Excel-405<br>
protein free medium (JRH Bioscience) in a shaker flask at<br>
27°C. Cells at a density of 1.5 X 106 cells/ml were<br>
infected with the recombinant baculovirus described above<br>
at a multiplicity of infection of 5. The expression<br>
level of recombinant p38 was monitored by immunoblotting<br>
using a rabbit anti-p38 antibody (Santa Cruz<br>
Biotechnology). The cell mass was harvested 72 hours<br>
after infection when the expression level of p38 reached<br>
its maximum.<br>
Frozen cell paste from cells expressing the<br>
(His)6-tagged p38 was thawed in 5 volumes of Buffer A (50<br>
mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 2mM ß-Mercaptoethanol, 10%<br>
Glycerol and 0.2 mM PMSF). After mechanical disruption<br>
of the cells in a microfluidizer, the lysate was<br>
centrifuged at 30,000 x g for 30 minutes. The<br>
supernatant was incubated batchwise for 3-5 hours at 4°C<br>
with Talon™ (Clontech) metal affinity resin at a ratio of<br>
1 ml of resin per 2-4 mgs of expected p38. The resin was<br>
settled by centrifugation at 500 x g for 5 minutes and<br>
gently washed batchwise with Buffer A. The resin was<br>
slurried and poured into a column (approx. 2.6 x 5.0 cm)<br>
and washed with Buffer A + 5 mM imidazole.<br>
The (His)6-p38 was eluted with Buffer A + 100<br>
mM imidazole and subsequently dialyzed overnight at 4°C<br>
against 2 liters of Buffer B, (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 25 mM<br><br>
ß-glycerophosphate, 5% glycerol, 2mM DTT). The His6 tag<br>
was removed by addition of at 1.5 units thrombin<br>
(Calbiochem) per mg of p38 and incubation at 20°C for 2-3<br>
hours. The thrombin was quenched by addition of 0.2 mM<br>
PMSF and then the entire sample was loaded onto a 2 ml<br>
benzamidine agarose (American International Chemical)<br>
column.<br>
The flow through fraction was directly loaded<br>
onto a 2.6 x 5.0 cm Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column<br>
previously equilibrated in Buffer B + 0.2 mM PMSF. The<br>
p38 was eluted with a 20 column volume linear gradient to<br>
0.6M NaCl in Buffer B. The eluted protein peak was<br>
pooled and dialyzed overnight at 4°C vs. Buffer C (50 mM<br>
HEPES pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, 0.2 mM<br>
PMSF) .<br>
The dialyzed protein was concentrated in a<br>
Centriprep (Amicon) to 3-4 ml and applied to a 2.6 x 100<br>
cm Sephacryl S-100HR (Pharmacia) column. The protein was<br>
eluted at a flow rate of 35 ml/hr. The main peak was<br>
pooled, adjusted to 20 mM DTT, concentrated to 13-80<br>
mgs/ml and frozen in aliquots at -70°C or used<br>
immediately.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Activation of p38<br>
p38 was activated by combining 0.5 mg/ml p38<br>
with 0.005 mg/ml DD-double mutant MKK6 in Buffer B + lOmM<br>
MgCl,, 2mM ATP, 0. 2mM Na2V04 for 30 minutes at 20cC. The<br>
activation mixture was then loaded onto a 1.0 x 10 cm<br>
MonoQ column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a linear 20<br>
column volume gradient to 1.0 M NaCl in Buffer B. The<br><br>
activated p38 eluted after the ADP and ATP. The<br>
activated p38 peak was pooled and dialyzed against buffer<br>
B + 0.2mM Na2VO4 to remove the NaCl. The dialyzed protein<br>
was adjusted to 1.1M potassium phosphate by addition of a<br>
4.OM stock solution and loaded onto a 1.0 x 10 cm HIC<br>
(Rainin Hydropore) column previously equilibrated in<br>
Buffer D (10% glycerol, 20mM ß-glycerophosphate, 2.OmM<br>
DTT) + 1.1MK2HP04. The protein was eluted with a 20<br>
column volume linear gradient to Buffer D + 50mM K2HPO4.<br>
The double phosphorylated p38 eluted as the main peak and<br>
was pooled for dialysis against Buffer B + 0.2mM Na2v04.<br>
The activated p38 was stored at -70°C.<br>

p38 Inhibition Assays<br>
A. Inhibition of Phosphorylation of EGF Receptor<br>
Peptide<br>
This assay was carried out in the presence of<br>
10 mM MgCl2, 25 mM ^-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol and<br>
100 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.6. For a typical ICb0<br>
determination, a stock solution was prepared containing<br>
all of the above components and activated p38 (5 nM).<br>
The stock solution was aliquotted into vials. A fixed<br>
volume of DMSO or inhibitor in DMSO (final concentration<br>
of DMSO in reaction was 5%) was introduced to each vial,<br>
mixed and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature.<br>
EGF receptor peptide, KRELVEPLTPSGEAPNQALLR, a phosphoryl<br>
acceptor in p38-catalyzed kinase reaction (1), was added<br>
to each vial to a final concentration of 200 uM. The<br>
kinase reaction was initiated with ATP (100 uM) and the<br>
vials were incubated at 30°C. After 30 minutes, zhe<br><br>
reactions were quenched with equal volume of 101<br>
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA).<br>
The phosphorylated peptide was quantified by<br>
HPLC analysis. Separation of phosphorylated peptide from<br>
the unphosphorylated peptide was achieved on a reverse<br>
phase column (Deltapak, 5 μm, C18 100D, Part no. 011795)<br>
with a binary gradient of water and acteonitrile, each<br>
containing 0.1% TFA. IC50 (concentration of inhibitor<br>
yielding 50% inhibition) was determined by plotting the<br>
percent (%) activity remaining against inhibitor<br>
concentration.<br>
B. Inhibition of ATPase Activity<br>
This assay is carried out in the presence of 10<br>
mM MgCl2, 25 mM ß-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol and 100<br>
mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.6. For a typical Ki<br>
determination, the Km for ATP in the ATPase activity of<br>
activated p38 reaction is determined in the absence of<br>
inhibitor and in the presence of two concentrations of<br>
inhibitor. A stock solution is prepared containing all<br>
of the above components and activated p38 (60 nM). The<br>
stock solution is aliquotted into vials. A fixed volume<br>
of DMSO or inhibitor in DMSO (final concentration of DMSO<br>
in reaction was 2.5%) is introduced to each vial, mixed<br>
and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. The<br>
reaction is initiated by adding various concentrations of<br>
ATP and then incubated at 30°C. After 30 minutes, the<br>
reactions are quenched with 50 μl of EDTA (O.1 M, final<br>
concentration), pH 8.0. The product of p38 ATPase<br>
activity, ADP, is quantified by HPLC analysis.<br>
Separation of ADP from ATP is achieved on a<br>
reversed phase column (Supelcosil, LC-18, 3 μm, part no.<br><br>
5-8985) using a binary solvent gradient of following<br>
composition: Solvent A - 0.1 M phosphate buffer<br>
containing 8 mM tetrabutylamrnonium hydrogen sulfate<br>
(Sigma Chemical Co., catalogue no. T-7158), Solvent B -<br>
Solvent A with 30% methanol.<br>
Ki is determined from the rate data as a<br>
function of inhibitor and ATP concentrations.<br>
p38 inhibitors of this invention will inhibit<br>
the ATPase activity of p38.<br>
C. Inhibition of IL-1, TNF, IL-6 and IL-8<br>
Production in LPS-Stimulated PBMCs<br>
Inhibitors were serially diluted in DMSO from a<br>
20 mM stock. At least 6 serial dilutions were prepared.<br>
Then 4x inhibitor stocks were prepared by adding 4 pi of<br>
an inhibitor dilution to 1 ml of RPMI1640 medium/10%<br>
fetal bovine serum. The 4x inhibitor stocks contained<br>
inhibitor at concentrations of 80 μM, 32 μM, 12.8 μM,<br>
5.12 μM, 2.048 μM, 0.819 μM, 0.328 μM, 0.131 μM, 0.052<br>
μM, 0.021 uM etc. The 4x inhibitor stocks were pre-<br>
warmed at 37°C until use.<br>
Fresh human blood buffy cells were separated<br>
from other cells in a Vacutainer CPT from Becton &amp;<br>
Dickinson (containing 4 ml blood and enough DPBS without<br>
2 + 2 +<br>
Mg /Ca to fill the tube) by centrifugation at 1500 x g<br>
for 15 min. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs),<br>
located on top of the gradient in the Vacutainer, were<br>
removed and washed twice with RPMI1640 medium/10%, fetal<br>
bovine serum. PBMCs were collected by centrifugation at<br>
500 x g for 10 min. The total cell number was determined<br>
using a Neubauer Cell Chamber and the cells were adjusted<br>
to a concentration of 4.8 x 106 cells/ml in cell culture<br><br>
medium (RPMI164 0 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serum).<br>
Alternatively, whole blood containing an anti-<br>
coagulant was used directly in the assay.<br>
100 ul of cell suspension or whole blood were<br>
placed in each well of a 96-well cell culture plate.<br>
Then 50 ul of the 4x inhibitor stock was added to the<br>
cells. Finally, 50 ul of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)<br>
working stock solution (16 ng/ml in cell culture medium)<br>
was added to give a final concentration of 4 ng/ml LPS in<br>
the assay. The total assay volume of the vehicle control<br>
was also adjusted to 200 ul by adding 50 μl cell culture<br>
medium. The PBMC cells or whole blood were then<br>
incubated overnight (for 12-15 hours) at 37° C/5% CO2 in a<br>
humidified atmosphere.<br>
The next day the cells were mixed on a shaker<br>
for 3-5 minutes before centrifugation at 500 x g for 5<br>
minutes. Cell culture supernatants were harvested and<br>
analyzed by ELISA for levels of IL-lb (R&amp;D Systems,<br>
Quantikine kits, #DBL50), TNF-a (BioSource, #KHC3012),<br>
IL-6 (Endogen, #EH2-IL6) and IL-8 (Endogen, #EH2-IL8)<br>
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The<br>
ELISA data were used to generate dose-response curves<br>
from which IC50 values were derived.<br>
Results for the kinase assay ("kinase";<br>
subsection A, above), IL-1 and TNF in LPS-stimulated<br>
PBMCs ("cell") and IL-1, TNF and IL-6 in whole blood<br>
("WB") for various p38 inhibitors of this invention are<br>
shown in Table 7 below:<br><br><br>
Other p38 inhibitors of this invention will<br>
also inhibit phosphorylation of EGF receptor peptide, and<br>
will inhibit the production of IL-1, TNF and IL--6, as<br>
well as IL-8, in LPS-stimulated PBMCs or in whole blood.<br>
D. Inhibition of IL-6 and IL-8<br>
Production in IL-1-Stimulated PBMCs<br>
This assay is carried, out on PBMCs exactly the<br>
same as above except that 50 ul of an IL-lb working stock<br>
solution (2 ng/ml in cell culture medium) is added to the<br>
assay instead of the (LPS) working stock solution.<br>
Cell culture supernatants are harvested as<br>
described above and analyzed by ELISA for levels of IL-6<br>
(Endogen, #EH2-IL6) and IL-8 (Endogen, #EH2-IL8)<br>
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The<br>
ELISA data are used to generate dose-response curves from<br>
which IC50 values were derived.<br><br>
E. Inhibition of LPS-Induced<br>
Prostaglandin Endoperoxide Synthase-2<br>
(PGHS-2, or COX-2) Induction in PBMCs<br>
Human peripheral mononuclear cells (FBMCs) are<br>
isolated from fresh human blood buffy coats by<br>
centrifugation in a Vacutainer CPT (Becton &amp; Dickinson).<br>
15 x 106 cells are seeded in a 6-well tissue culture dish<br>
containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine<br>
serμM, 50U/ml penicillin, 50 ug/ml streptomycin, and 2 mM<br>
L-glutamine. Compounds are added at 0.2, 2.0 and 20 μM<br>
final concentrations in DMSO. LPS is then added at a<br>
final concentration of 4 ng/ml to induce enzyme<br>
expression. The final culture volume is 10 ml/well.<br>
After overnight incubation at 37°C, 5% CO2, the<br>
cells are harvested by scraping and subsequent<br>
centrifugation, the supernatant is removed, and the cells<br>
are washed twice in ice-cold DPBS (Dulbecco's phosphate<br>
buffered saline, BioWhittaker). The cells are lysed on<br>
ice for 10 min in 50 μl cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-<br>
HC1, pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton-X-100, 1% deoxycholic<br>
acid, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM EDTA, 2% aprotinin (Sigma), 10 ug/ml<br>
pepstatin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mM PMSF, 1 mM<br>
benzamidine, 1 mM DTT) containing 1 ul Benzonase (DNAse<br>
from Merck). The protein concentration of each sample is<br>
determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) and bovine serum<br>
albumin as a standard. Then the protein concentration of<br>
each sample is adjusted to 1 mg/ml with cold lysis<br>
buffer. To 100 ul lysate an equal volume of 2xSDS PAGE<br>
loading buffer is added and the sample is boiled for 5<br>
min. Proteins (30 μg/lane) are size-fractionated on 4-<br>
2OR SDS PAGE gradient gels (Novex) and subsequently<br>
transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by<br><br>
electrophoretic means for 2 hours at 100 mA in Towbin<br>
transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine) containing<br>
20% methanol. After transfer, the membrane is pretreated<br>
for 1 hour at room temperature with blocking buffer (51<br>
non-fat dry milk in DPBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween-20)<br>
and washed 3 times in DPBS/0.1% Tween-20. The membrane<br>
is incubated overnight at 4°C with a 1: 250 dilution of<br>
monoclonal anti-COX-2 antibody (Transduction<br>
Laboratories) in blocking buffer. After 3 washes in<br>
DPBS/0.1% Tween-20, the membrane is incubated with a<br>
1:1000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated<br>
sheep antiserum to mouse Ig (Amersham) in blocking buffer<br>
for 1 h at room temperature. Then the membrane is washed<br>
again 3 times in DPBS/0.1% Tween-20. An ECL detection<br>
system (SuperSignal™ CL-HRP Substrate System, Pierce) is<br>
used to determine the levels of expression of COX-2.<br>
