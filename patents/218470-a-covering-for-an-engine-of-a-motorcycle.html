1 0 JAN 2008 GRANTED <br><br>
The present invention relates to an engine for motorcycle.<br>
[DETAILED   DESCRIPTION   OF   THE   INVENTION]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to an engine for a motorcycle having dummy covers for covering at least part of cylinder heads from the sides and overhead covers for covering at least part of head covers coupled to said cylinder heads from above and the sides.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-234562 discloses a construction in which at least part of head covers is covered by overhead covers from above and the sides in order to enhance the functional beauty of an engine for a motorcycle  and to improve noiseproofing. Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 11-82051 discloses a construction in which at least part of cylinder heads is covered by dummy covers having dummy cooling fins from the sides in order to enhance the functional beauty of an engine for a motorcycle. [0003]<br>
2<br><br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the construction disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-234562, protrusions provided in the head covers are engaged with the overhead covers, the overhead covers are fastened to the head covers with bolts, and the bolt heads are arranged to face the outer surface of the overhead covers . The bolts are seen from outside . To enhance the appearance functional beauty, bolt heads of a special shape must be employed and an expensive surface treatment with chromeplating must be done to the bolt heads.<br>
[0004]<br>
In the construction disclosed in Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. Hei 11-82051, the dummy covers are attached to stays mounted on the cylinder heads in snap fit and are fastened to the stays and a crankcase with bolts in order to increase vibration endurance. The bolt heads are exposed to outside. There may arise the same problem as Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application No. 2000-234562.<br>
[0005]<br>
The present invention has been made in view of such circumstances and an object of the present invention is to provide an engine for a motorcycle which requires no parts of a special shape and no surface treatment and enhances the functional beauty.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Means to Solve the Problems]<br>
To achieve the foregoing object, in the invention<br>
3<br><br>
aWording to claim 1, an engine for a motorcycle having dummy covers for covering at least part of cylinder heads from the sides; and overhead covers for covering at least part of head covers coupled to the cylinder heads from above and the sides, wherein: at least one spot of the dummy covers is fastened to an engine main unit including the cylinder heads and head covers with bolts, and a plurality of engaging protrusions provided in the overhead covers formed in a shape to cover the bolts are resiliently engaged with the engine main unit or the dummy covers so as to be detachable or attachable. [0007]<br>
Such a construction of the invention according to claim 1 can require no parts of a special shape and no surface treatment and enhance the functional beauty. In other words, in many cases, the dummy covers for covering at least part of the cylinder heads from the sides are provided with dummy cooling fins for enhancing the functional beauty and are made of metal to eliminate heat and enhance the functional beauty. Strong support is thus necessary. Also in many cases, the overhead covers require no dummy cooling fins and are formed of lightweight material such as synthetic resin since requirements to eliminate heat and to enhance the functional beauty are relatively low. It is thus unnecessary to support the overhead covers very strongly. At least one spot of the dummy covers is fastened to the engine main unit and a plurality of engaging protrusions provided in the overhead covers are resiliently engaged with the engine main unit or the dummy covers so as to be detachable or attachable. The dummy covers<br>
4<br><br>
and overhead covers can be supported in the engine main unit in a construction suitable thereto. The bolts for fastening at least one spot of the dummy covers to the engine main unit are covered by the overhead covers. Parts of a special shape and a surface treatment which have been required since the bolts are exposed to outside become unnecessary. The cost can be reduced and the functional beauty can be enhanced. [0008]<br>
In the invention according to claim 2, in addition to the construction of the invention according to claim 1, the dummy covers are provided with notches for arranging spark plugs mounted on the cylinder heads, and the overhead covers are formed in a shape to cover the notches from above. According to such a construction, the notches for arranging the spark plugs are covered by the overhead covers from above. The functional beauty can be thus enhanced. A plurality of engaging protrusions provided in the overhead covers are resiliently engaged with at least either of the cylinder heads and the head covers so as to be detachable or attachable. The overhead covers can be easily detached or attached. The maintenance operability of the spark plugs can be improved. [0009]<br>
In the invention according to claim 3, in addition to the construction of the invention according to claim 1 or 2, cylinders consisting of part of the engine main unit are coupled to the cylinder heads, in portions corresponding to the fins closest to the cylinder heads of a plurality of fins provided in the sides of the cylinders aligned in the direction along<br>
5<br><br>
cylinder axes of the cylinders, at least one recess is provided in the cylinders, and protrusions provided in the dummy covers are fitted in the recesses. According to such a construction, the dummy covers are supported by the cylinders in the engine main unit together with fastening at least one spot thereof to the engine main unit with bolts . The dummy covers which become relatively heavy can be reliably fixed to the engine main unit. The mutual fitting.portions of the dummy covers and the cylinders can be hidden by the fins provided in the cylinders. The mutual fitting of the dummy covers and the cylinders will not deteriorate the functional beauty of the engine. [0010]<br>

[0053]<br>
The fins 40A ..., 44A ..., 45A ...; 40B ..., 44B ..., 45B ... for enhancing the appearance have a function to decide the appearance shape of both the banks BA, BB. In the above-described construction, the fins 40A ..., 44A ..., 45A ...; 40B ..., 44B ..., 45B ... in both the banks BA, BB are arranged corresponding to almost the same position along the cylinder axes CA, CB of the banks BA, BB. A visual impression so that the heights of both the banks BA, BB are not different can be obtained. The functional beauty of the V-type engine E can be enhanced and the marketability of the engine E can be improved.<br>
[0054]<br>
In the side view in the direction along the axis of the crankshaft 30, the contour shapes of the first and second<br><br>
cylinders 33A, 33B including the fins 40A ... , 40B ... and the dummy covers 42A, 43A; 42B, 43B including the fins 44A, 45A; 44B, 45B are formed almost symmetrically with respect to a plane including the bisector 76 between both the banks BA, BB passing through the cross point CP of the cylinder axes CA, CB of both the banks BA, BB. The contours of the first and second banks BA, BB are shaped almost symmetrically. The functional beauty of the V-type engine E can be enhanced and the marketability can be improved. [0055]<br>
The lengths LA3, LB3 between cross points at which the right-side and left-side first overhead covers 64A, 65A and the right-side and left-side second overhead covers 64B, 65B for covering at least part of the first and second head covers 35A, 35B or the right and left sides of the first and second head covers 35A, 35B in this embodiment from above and the sides cross the cylinder axes CA, CB of the first and second cylinders 33A, 33B in a plane orthogonal to the axis of the crankshaft 30 and the cross point CP at which both the cylinder axes CA, CB cross each other in the plane are set to be almost equal in both the banks BA, BB. The height difference and the appearance shape difference of both the banks BA, BB appear to be small. The functional beauty of the V-type engine E can be enhanced and the marketability can be improved. [0056]<br>
