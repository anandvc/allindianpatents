				<td>A SUPPORT STRUCTURE FOR MEASURING BIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes support and sensing<br>
structures positioned in a physiologic tunnel for<br>
measuring bodily functions and to manage abnormal<br>
conditions indicated by the measurements.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interfering constituents and variables can introduce<br>
significant source of errors that prevent measured<br>
biologic parameters from being of clinical value. In<br>
order to bypass said interfering constituents and achieve<br>
undisturbed signals invasive and semi-invasive techniques<br>
have been used. Such techniques have many drawbacks<br>
including difficulties in providing continuous monitoring<br>
for long periods of time. Non-invasive techniques also<br>
failed to deliver the clinical usefulness needed. The<br>
placement of a sensor on the skin characterized by the<br>
presence of interfering constituents do not allow<br>
obtaining clinically useful nor accurate signals due to<br>
the presence of said interfering constituents and<br>
background noise which greatly exceeds the signal related<br>
to the physiologic parameter being measured.<br>
The most precise, accurate, and clinically useful<br>
way of evaluating thermal status of the body in humans<br>
and animals is by measuring brain temperature. Brain<br>
temperature measurement is the key and universal<br>
indicator of both disease and health equally, and is the<br>
only vital sign that cannot be artificially changed by<br>
emotional states. The other vital signs (heart rate,<br>
blood pressure, and respiratory rate) all can be<br>
influenced and artificially changed by emotional states<br>
or voluntary effort.<br>
Body temperature is determined by the temperature of<br>
blood, which emits heat as far-infrared radiation.<br>
Adipose tissue (fat tissue) absorbs far-infrared and the<br>
body is virtually completely protected with a layer of<br>
adipose tissue adherent to the skin. Thus measurement of<br>
temperature using the skin does not achieve precision nor<br>
accuracy because previous techniques using sensors placed<br>
on skin included by the presence of adipose tissue.<br>
Because it appeared to be impossible with current<br>
technology to non-invasively measure brain temperature,<br>
attempts were made to determine internal body<br>
temperature, also referred to as core temperature. An<br>
invasive, artificial, inconvenient, and costly process is<br>
currently used to measure internal (core) temperature<br>
consisting of inserting a catheter with a temperature<br>
sensor in the urinary canal, rectum or esophagus. But<br>
such methodology is not suitable for routine measurement,<br>
it is painful, and has potential fatal complications.<br>
Semi-invasive techniques have also being tried.<br>
Abreu disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,120,460 apparatus<br>
and methods for measuring core temperature continuously<br>
using a contact lens in the eyelid pocket, but the<br>
contact lens is a semi-invasive device which requires<br>
prescription by a physician and sometimes it is not easy<br>
to place the contact lens in the eye of an infant or even<br>
in adults and many people are afraid of touching their<br>
eyes.<br>
There are several drawbacks and limitations in the<br>
prior art for continuous and/or core measurement of<br>
temperature.<br>
Measurement of temperature today is non-continuous,<br>
non-core and nurse dependent. Nurses have to stick a<br>
thermometer in the patient's mouth, rectum or ear. To get<br>
core temperature nurses invasively place a tube inside<br>
the body which can cause infection and costly<br>
complications.<br>
Measurement of core temperature on a routine basis<br>
in the hospital and/or continuously is very difficult and<br>
risky because it requires an invasive procedure with<br>
insertion of tubes inside the body or by ingesting a<br>
thermometer pill. The thermometer pill can cause<br>
diarrhea, measure temperature of the fluid/food ingested<br>
and not body temperature, and have fatal complications if<br>
the pill obstructs the pancreas or liver ducts. Placement<br>
of sensors on the skin do not provide clinically useful<br>
measurements because of the presence of many interfering<br>
constituents including fat tissue.<br>
It is not possible to acquire precise and clinically<br>
useful measurements of not only brain temperature, but<br>
also metabolic parameters, physical parameters, chemical<br>
parameters, and the like by simply placing a sensor on<br>
the skin. One key element is the presence of fat tissue.<br>
Fat varies from person to person, fat varies with aging,<br>
fat content varies from time to time in the same person,<br>
fat attenuates a signal coming from a blood vessel, fat<br>
absorbs heat, fat prevents delivery of undisturbed far-<br>
infrared radiation, fat increases the distance traveled<br>
by the element being measured inside the body and an<br>
external sensor placed on the surface of the skin.<br>
There is a need to identify a method and apparatus<br>
that can non-invasively, conveniently and continuously<br>
monitor brain temperature in a painless, simple, external<br>
and safe manner with sensors placed on the skin.<br>
There is further a need to identify a method and<br>
apparatus that can conveniently, non-invasively, safely<br>
and precisely monitor biological parameters including<br>
metabolic parameters, physical parameters, chemical<br>
parameters, and the like.<br>
There is a need to identify an apparatus and method<br>
capable of measuring biological parameters by positioning<br>
a sensor on a physiologic tunnel for the acquisition of<br>
undisturbed and continuous biological signals.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods, apparatus<br>
and systems that effectively address the needs of the<br>
prior art.<br>
In general, the invention provides a set of sensing<br>
systems and reporting means which may be used<br>
individually or in combination, which are designed to<br>
access a physiologic tunnel to measure biological,<br>
physical and chemical parameters. Anatomically and<br>
physiologically speaking, the tunnel discovered by the<br>
present invention is an anatomic path which conveys<br>
undisturbed physiologic signals to the exterior. The<br>
tunnel consists of a direct and undisturbed connection<br>
between the source of the function (signal) within the<br>
body and an external point at the end of the tunnel<br>
located on the skin. A physiologic tunnel conveys<br>
continuous and integral data on the physiology of the<br>
body. An undisturbed signal from within the body is<br>
delivered to an external point at the end of the tunnel.<br>
A sensor placed on the skin at the end of the tunnel<br>
allows optimal signal acquisition without interfering<br>
constituents and sources of error.<br>
Included in the present invention are support<br>
structures for positioning a sensor on the skin at the<br>
end of the tunnel. The present invention discloses<br>
devices directed at measuring brain temperature, brain<br>
function, metabolic function, hydrodynamic function,<br>
hydration status, hemodynamic function, body chemistry<br>
and the like. The components include devices and methods<br>
for evaluating biological parameters using patches,<br>
clips, eyeglasses, head mounted gear and the like with<br>
sensing systems adapted to access physiologic tunnels to<br>
provide precise and clinically useful information about<br>
the physiologic status of the wearer and for enhancing<br>
the safety and performance of said wearer, and helping to<br>
enhance and preserve the life of said wearer by providing<br>
adequate reporting means and alert means relating to the<br>
biological parameter being monitored. Other components<br>
provide for producing direct or indirect actions, acting<br>
on another device, or adjusting another device or article<br>
of manufacture based on the biological parameter<br>
measured.<br>
The search for a better way to measure biological<br>
parameters has resulted in long and careful research,<br>
which included the discovery of a Brain Temperature<br>
Tunnel (BTT) and other physiologic tunnels in humans and<br>
animals. The present invention was the first to recognize<br>
the physiologic tunnel in the body. The present invention<br>
was yet the first to recognize the end of the tunnel on<br>
the skin surface in which an optimal signal is acquired<br>
and measurements can be done without the presence of<br>
interfering constituents and background noise that<br>
exceeds the signal being measured. The present invention<br>
was also the first to recognize and precisely map the<br>
special geometry and location of the tunnel including the<br>
main entry point. The present invention was yet first to<br>
recognize the precise positioning of sensing systems at<br>
the main entry point for optimal signal acquisition.<br>
Careful studies have been undertaken including software<br>
development for characterizing infrared radiation to<br>
precisely determine the different aspects of the tunnel.<br>
This research has determined that the measurement of<br>
brain (core) temperature and other body parameters can be<br>
accomplished in a non-invasive and continuous manner in<br>
humans and animals with sensors positioned in a confined<br>
area of the skin at the end of a physiologic tunnel.<br>
The key function and critical factor for life<br>
preservation and human performance is brain temperature.<br>
Brain tissue is the tissue in the body most susceptible<br>
to thermal damage, by both high and low temperature.<br>
Brain temperature is the most clinically relevant<br>
parameter to determine the thermal status of the body and<br>
the human brain is responsible for 18 to 20% of the heat<br>
produced in the body, which is an extraordinary fact<br>
considering that the brain represents only 2% of the<br>
body weight. The great amount of thermal energy generated<br>
in the brain is kept in a confined space and the scalp,<br>
skull, fat and CSF (cerebral spinal fluid) form an<br>
insulating layer. The recognition of the BTT by the<br>
present invention bypasses the insulating barriers and<br>
provides a direct connection to inside the brain<br>
physiology and physics.<br>
Anatomically and physiologically speaking, a Brain<br>
Temperature Tunnel consists of a continuous, direct, and<br>
undisturbed connection between the heat source within the<br>
brain and an external point at the end of the tunnel. The<br>
physical and physiological events at one end of the<br>
tunnel inside the brain are reproduced at the opposite<br>
end on the skin. A BTT enables the integral and direct<br>
heat transfer through the tunnel without interference by<br>
heat absorbing elements, i.e., elements that can absorb<br>
far-infrared radiation transmitted as heat by blood<br>
within the brain. There are six characteristics needed to<br>
define a BTT. These characteristics are:<br>
1)    area without heat absorbing elements,<br>
i.e., the area must not contain adipose tissue (fat<br>
tissue). This is a key and needed characteristic for<br>
defining a temperature tunnel,<br>
2)    area must have a terminal branch of a<br>
vessel in order to deliver the integral amount of<br>
heat,<br>
3)    terminal branch has to be a direct branch<br>
of a blood vessel from the brain,<br>
4)    terminal branch has to be superficially-<br>
located to avoid heat absorption by deep structures<br>
such as muscles,<br>
5)    area must have a thin and negligible<br>
interface between a sensor and the source of thermal<br>
energy to achieve high heat flow, and<br>
6)    area must not have thermoregulatory<br>
arteriovenous shunts.<br>
All six characteristics are present on the skin on<br>
the medial canthal area adjacent to the medial corner of<br>
the eye above the medial canthal tendon and in the medial<br>
third of the upper eyelid. In more detail the end of BTT<br>
area on the skin measures about 11 mm in diameter<br>
measured from the medial corner of the eye at the medial<br>
canthal tendon and extend superiorly for about 6 mm and<br>
then extends into the upper eyelid in a horn like<br>
projection for another 22 mm.<br>
The BTT area is the only area in the body without<br>
adipose tissue, which is in addition supplied by a<br>
terminal branch, which has a superficial blood vessel<br>
coming from the brain vasculature, and which has a thin<br>
interface and no thermoregulatory shunts. The BTT area is<br>
supplied by a terminal branch of the superior ophthalmic<br>
vein which is a direct connection to the cavernous sinus,<br>
said cavernous sinus being an endothelium-lined system of<br>
venous channels inside the brain which collects and<br>
stores thermal energy. The blood vessel supplying the BTT<br>
area is void of thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts and<br>
it ends on the skin adjacent to the medial corner of the<br>
eye and in the superior aspect of the medial canthal area<br>
right at the beginning of the upper eyelid. The blood<br>
vessels deliver undisturbed heat to the skin on the<br>
medial canthal area and upper eyelid as can be seen in<br>
the color as well as black and white photos of infrared<br>
images shown in FIGS. 1 and 2. The undisturbed thermal<br>
radiation from the brain is delivered to the surface of<br>
the skin at the end of the tunnel. The heat is delivered<br>
to an area of skin without fat located at the end of the<br>
tunnel. The blood vessel delivering heat is located just<br>
below the skin and thus there is no absorption of<br>
infrared radiation by deep structures.<br>
If the blood vessel is located deep, other tissues<br>
and chemical substances would absorb the heat, and that<br>
can invalidate the clinical usefulness of the<br>
measurement. There is direct heat transfer and the skin<br>
in the BTT area is the thinnest skin in the body and is<br>
void of thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts. A very<br>
important aspect for optimal measurement of temperature<br>
is no interference by fat tissue and direct heat<br>
transfer.<br>
The absence of fat tissue in this particular and<br>
unique area in the body at the end of the tunnel allows<br>
the undisturbed acquisition of the signal. The<br>
combination of those six elements allows the undisturbed<br>
and integral emission of infrared radiation from the<br>
brain in the form of direct heat transfer at the BTT area<br>
location, which can be seen in the infrared image<br>
photographs (FIGS. 1 to 8). The BTT and physiologic<br>
tunnels are also referred in this description as the<br>
"Target Area".<br>
From a physical standpoint, the BTT is the<br>
equivalent of a Brain Thermal Energy tunnel with high<br>
total radiant power and high heat flow. The temperature<br>
of the brain is determined by the balance between thermal<br>
energy produced due to metabolic rate plus the thermal<br>
energy delivered by the arterial supply to the brain<br>
minus the heat that is removed by cerebral blood flow.<br>
Convection of heat between tissue and capillaries is high<br>
and the temperature of the cerebral venous blood is in<br>
equilibrium with cerebral tissue. Accordingly,<br>
parenchymal temperature and thermal energy of the brain<br>
can be evaluated by measuring the temperature and thermal<br>
energy of the cerebral venous blood. The superior<br>
ophthalmic vein has a direct and undisturbed connection<br>
to the cavernous sinus and carries cerebral venous blood<br>
with a thermal energy capacity of 3.6 J.ml-1.(°C)-1 at<br>
hematocrit of 45%. Cerebral thermodynamic response,<br>
thermal energy, and brain temperature can be evaluated by<br>
placing a sensor to capture thermal energy conveyed by<br>
the cerebral venous blood at the end of the BTT.<br>
The research concerning BTT and physiologic tunnels<br>
involved various activities and studies including: 1) In-<br>
vitro histologic analysis of mucosal and superficial body<br>
areas; 2) In-vivo studies with temperature evaluation of<br>
external areas in humans and animals; 3) In-vivo<br>
functional angiographic evaluation of heat source; 4)<br>
Morphologic studies of the histomorphometric features of<br>
the BTT area; 5) In-vivo evaluation of temperature in the<br>
BTT area using: thermocouples, thermistors, and far-<br>
infrared; 6) Comparison of the BTT area measurements with<br>
the internal eye anatomy and current standard most used<br>
(oral) for temperature measurement; 7) Cold and heat<br>
challenge to determine temperature stability of BTT; and<br>
8) Infrared imaging and isotherm determination. Software<br>
for evaluating geometry of tunnel was also developed and<br>
used. Simultaneous measurement of a reference temperature<br>
and temperature in the BTT area were done using pre-<br>
equally calibrated thermistors. A specific circuit with<br>
multiple channels was designed for the experiments and<br>
data collection.<br>
The measurement of temperature in the BTT area<br>
showed almost identical temperature signal between the<br>
BTT area and the internal conjunctival anatomy of the<br>
eye, which is a continuation of the central nervous<br>
system. Measurement of the temperature in the internal<br>
conjunctival anatomy of eye as used in the experiment was<br>
described by Abreu in U.S. Patents No. 6,120,460 and<br>
6,312,393. The averaged temperature levels for BTT and<br>
internal eye were within 0.1 °c.(0.18 °F) with an average<br>
normothermia value equivalent of 37.1°C (98.8 °F) for the<br>
BTT and 37°C {98.6 °F) for the internal eye. Comparison<br>
with the standard most used, oral temperature, was also<br>
performed. The temperature voltage signal of the BTT area<br>
showed an average higher temperature level in the BTT<br>
area of an equivalent of 0.3 °C (0.5 °F) when compared to<br>
oral.<br>
Subjects underwent cold challenge and heat challenge<br>
through exercising and heat room. The lowering and rising<br>
of temperature in the BTT area was proportional to the<br>
lowering and rising in the oral cavity. However, the rate<br>
of temperature change was faster in the BTT area than for<br>
oral by about 1.2 minutes, and temperature at the BTT<br>
site was 0.5 "C (0.9 °F) higher on few occasions.<br>
Subjects of different race, gender, and age were<br>
evaluated to determine the precise location of the BTT<br>
area across a different population and identify any<br>
anatomic variation. The location of the BTT was present<br>
at the same location in all subjects with no significant<br>
anatomic variation, which can be seen in a sample of<br>
infrared imaging of different subjects.<br>
The tunnel is located in a crowded anatomic area and<br>
thus the positioning of the sensor requires special<br>
geometry for optimal alignment with the end of the<br>
tunnel. The clinical usefulness of the tunnel can only be<br>
achieved with the special positioning of the sensor in<br>
relation to anatomic landmarks and the support structure.<br>
The tunnel is located in a unique position with<br>
distinctive anatomic landmarks that help define the<br>
external geometry and location of the end of the tunnel.<br>
The main entry point of the tunnel, which is the<br>
preferred location for positioning the sensor, requires<br>
the sensor to be preferably placed in the outer edge of a<br>
support structure. The preferred embodiment for the<br>
measurement of biological parameters by accessing a<br>
physiologic tunnel includes sensors positioned in a<br>
particular geometric position on the support structure.<br>
The support structure includes patches containing<br>
sensors. For the purpose of the description any structure<br>
containing an adhesive as means to secure said structure<br>
to the skin at the end of the tunnel is referred to as a<br>
patch including strips with adhesive surfaces such as a<br>
"BAND-AID" adhesive bandage. It is understood that a<br>
variety of attachment means can be used including<br>
adhesives, designs incorporating spring tension pressure<br>
attachment, and designs based on other attachment methods<br>
such as elastic, rubber, jelly-pads and the like.<br>
The patches are adapted to position sensors at the<br>
end of the tunnel for optimal acquisition of the signal.<br>
The patch is preferably secured to the area by having an<br>
adhesive backing which lays against the skin, although a<br>
combination of adhesive and other means for creating a<br>
stable apposition of the sensor to the tunnel can be used<br>
such as fastening or pressure.<br>
Support structures also include clips or structures<br>
that are positioned at the end of the tunnel with or<br>
without adhesive and which are secured to the area by<br>
pressure means. Any structure that uses pressure means to<br>
secure said structure to the skin at the end of the<br>
tunnel is referred as a clip.<br>
Head-mounted structures are structures mounted on<br>
the head or neck for positioning sensors on the end of<br>
the tunnel and include head bands with accessories that<br>
are adjacent to the tunnel, visors, helmets, headphone,<br>
structures wrapping around the ear and the like. For the<br>
purpose of this description TempAlert is referred herein<br>
as a system that measures temperature in the BTT area and<br>
has means to report the measured value and that can<br>
incorporate alarm means that are activated when certain<br>
levels are reached. Support structures yet include any<br>
article that has sensing means in which said sensing<br>
means are positioned at the end of the tunnel.<br>
Support structures further include medial canthal<br>
pieces of eyeglasses. A medial canthal piece is also<br>
referred to herein as a medial canthal pad and includes a<br>
pad or a piece which positions sensing means on the skin<br>
at the medial canthal area on top of a tunnel, with said<br>
medial canthal piece being permanently attached to or<br>
mounted to an eyeglass. Any sensing means incorporated in<br>
an eyeglass (fixed or removable) for accessing a tunnel<br>
are referred to herein as EyEXT including means for<br>
sensing physical and chemical parameters. Any article of<br>
manufacture that has visual function, or ocular<br>
protection, or face protection with a part in contact<br>
with the tunnel is referred herein as eyeglasses and<br>
includes-  conventional  eyeglasses,  prescription<br>
eyeglasses, reading glasses, sunglasses, goggles of any<br>
type, masks (including gas masks, surgical masks, cloth<br>
masks, diving masks, eyemask for sleeping and the like)<br>
safety glasses, and the like.<br>
For brain temperature evaluation the tunnel area<br>
consists of the medial canthal area and the superior<br>
aspect of the medial corner of the eye. For brain<br>
function evaluation the tunnel area consists of primarily<br>
the upper eyelid area. For metabolic function evaluation<br>
the tunnel area consists of an area adjacent to the<br>
medial corner of the eye and both the upper and lower<br>
eyelids.<br>
The measurement of metabolic function, brain<br>
function, immunogenic function, physical parameters,<br>
physico-chemical parameters and the like includes a<br>
variety of support structures with sensors accessing the<br>
physiologic tunnels. The sensors are placed in apposition<br>
to the skin immediately adjacent to the medial corner of<br>
the eye preferably in the superior aspect of the medial<br>
canthal area. The sensor can also be positioned in the<br>
medial third of the upper eyelid. The sensor is most<br>
preferably located at the main entry point of the tunnel<br>
which is located on the skin 2.S mm medial to the corner<br>
of the eye and about 3 mm above the medial corner of the<br>
eye. The diameter of the main entry point is about 6 to 7<br>
mm. The positioning of the sensor at the main entry point<br>
of the tunnel provides the optimum site for measuring<br>
physical and chemical parameters of the body.<br>
Besides a sensor that makes contact with the skin at<br>
the Target Area, it is understood that sensors which do<br>
not make contact with the skin can be equally used. For<br>
instance an infrared-based temperature measuring system<br>
can be used. The measurement is based on the Stefan-<br>
Boltzman law of physics in which the total radiation is<br>
proportional to the fourth power of the absolute<br>
temperature, and the Wien Displacement law in which the<br>
product of the peak wavelength and the temperature are<br>
constant. The field of view of the non-contact infrared<br>
apparatus of the invention is adapted to match the size<br>
and geometry of the BTT area on the skin.<br>
A variety of lenses known in the art can be used for<br>
achieving the field of view needed for the application.<br>
For example, but not by way of limitation, a thermopile<br>
can be adapted and positioned in a manner to have a field<br>
of view aimed at the main entry point of the BTT area on<br>
the skin. The signal is then amplified, converted into a<br>
voltage output and digitized by a MCU (microcontroller).<br>
This infrared-based system can be integrated into a<br>
support structure that is in contact with the body such<br>
as any of the support structures of the present<br>
invention. In addition, it is understood that the<br>
infrared-based system of the present invention can be<br>
integrated as a portable or hand-held unit completely<br>
disconnected from the body. The apparatus of the present<br>
invention can be held by an operator that aims said<br>
apparatus at the BTT area to perform the measurement. The<br>
apparatus further includes an extension shaped to be<br>
comfortably positioned at the BTT site for measuring<br>
biological parameters without discomfort to the subject.<br>
The extension in contact with the skin at the BTT is<br>
shaped in accordance with the anatomic landmarks and the<br>
geometry and size of the BTT site. The infrared radiation<br>
sensor is positioned in the extension in contact with the<br>
skin for receiving radiation emitted from the BTT site.<br>
The present invention provides a method for<br>
measuring biological parameters including the steps of<br>
positioning sensing means on the skin area at the end of<br>
a tunnel, producing a signal corresponding to the<br>
biological parameter measured and reporting the value of<br>
the parameter measured.<br>
It is also include a method to measure biological<br>
parameters by non-contact infrared thermometry comprising<br>
the steps of positioning an infrared detector at the BTT<br>
site with a field of view that encompasses the BTT site<br>
and producing a signal corresponding to the measured<br>
infrared radiation. The biological parameters include<br>
temperature, blood chemistry, metabolic function and the<br>
like.<br>
Temperature and ability to do chemical analysis of<br>
blood components is proportional to blood perfusion. The<br>
present invention recognizes that the tunnel area, herein<br>
also referred as a Target Area, has the highest<br>
superficial blood perfusion in the head and has a direct<br>
communication with the brain, and that the blood vessels<br>
are direct branches of the cerebral vasculature and void<br>
of thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts. It was also<br>
recognized that the Target Area has the highest<br>
temperature in the surface of the body as can be seen in<br>
the photographs of experiments measuring infrared<br>
emission from the body and the eye.<br>
The Target Area discovered not only has the thinnest<br>
and most homogeneous skin in the whole body but is the<br>
only skin area without a fat layer. Since fat absorbs<br>
significant amounts of radiation, there is a significant<br>
reduction of signal. Furthermore other skin areas only<br>
provide imprecise and inaccurate signals because of the<br>
large variation of adipose tissue from person to person<br>
and also great variability of fat tissue according to<br>
age. This interference by a fat layer does not occur in<br>
the Target Area. Furthermore, the combined<br>
characteristics of the Target Area, contrary to the skin<br><br>
in the rest of the body, enable the acquisition of<br>
accurate signals and a good signal to noise ratio which<br>
far exceeds background noise. In addition, body<br>
temperature such as is found in the surface of the skin<br>
in other parts of the body is variable according to the<br>
environment.<br>
Another important discovery of the present invention<br>
was the demonstration that the Target Area is not<br>
affected by changes in the environment (experiments<br>
included cold and heat challenge), The Target Area<br>
provides an optimum location for temperature measurement<br>
which has a stable temperature and which is resistant to<br>
ambient conditions. The Target Area discovered has a<br>
direct connection to the brain, is not affected by the<br>
environment and provides a natural, complete thermal seal<br>
and stable core temperature. The apparatus and methods of<br>
the present invention achieve precision and clinical<br>
usefulness needed with the non-invasive placement of a<br>
temperature sensor on the skin in direct contact with the<br>
heat source from the brain without the interference of<br>
heat absorbing elements.<br>
The Target Area is extremely vascularized and is the<br>
only skin area in which a direct branch of the cerebral<br>
vasculature is superficially located and covered by a<br>
thin skin without a fat layer. The main trunk of the<br>
terminal branch of the ophthalmic vein is located right<br>
at the BTT area and just above the medial canthal tendon<br>
supplied by the medial palpebral artery and medial<br>
orbital vein. The BTT area on the skin supplied by a<br>
terminal and superficial blood vessel ending in a<br>
particular area without fat and void of thermoregulatory<br>
arteriovenous shunts provides a superficial source of<br>
undisturbed  biological  signals  including  brain<br>
temperature, metabolic function, physical signals, and<br>
body chemistry such as glucose level, and the like.<br>
Infrared spectroscopy is a technique based on the<br>
absorption of infrared radiation by substances with the<br>
identification of said substances according to its unique<br>
molecular oscillatory pattern depicted as specific<br>
resonance absorption peaks in the infrared region of the<br>
electromagnetic spectrum. Each chemical substance absorbs<br>
infrared radiation in a unique manner and has its own<br>
unique absorption spectra depending on its atomic and<br>
molecular arrangement and vibrational and rotational<br>
oscillatory pattern. This unique absorption spectra<br>
allows each chemical substance to basically have its own<br>
infrared spectrum, also referred to as fingerprint or<br>
signature which can be used to identify each of such<br>
substances. Radiation containing various infrared<br>
wavelengths is emitted at the substance to be measured<br>
and the amount of absorption of radiation is dependent<br>
upon the concentration of said chemical substance being<br>
measured according to Beer-Lambert's Law.<br>
Interfering constituents and variables such as fat,<br>
bone, muscle, ligaments and cartilage introduce<br>
significant source of errors which are particularly<br>
critical since the background noise greatly exceeds the<br>
signal of the substance of interest. Since those<br>
interfering constituents area not present on the skin at<br>
the BTT area, the sensing systems positioned at said BTT<br>
are can acquire optimal signal with minimal noise<br>
including spectroscopic-based measurements.<br>
Spectroscopic means integrated into support<br>
structures disclosed in the present invention can<br>
precisely non-invasively measure blood components since<br>
the main sources of variation and error, such as fat<br>
tissue, are not present in the Target Area. In addition,<br>
other key constituents which interfere with<br>
electromagnetic energy emission such as muscle, cartilage<br>
and bones, are not present in the Target Area either. The<br>
blood vessels delivering the infrared radiation are<br>
superficially located and the infrared radiation is<br>
delivered at the end of the tunnel without interacting<br>
with other structures. The only structure to be traversed<br>
by the infrared radiation is a very thin skin, which does<br>
not absorb the infrared wavelength. The present invention<br>
includes infrared spectroscopy means to provide a<br>
clinically useful measurement with the precise and<br>
accurate determination of the concentration of the blood<br>
components at the end of the tunnel.<br>
In addition to spectroscopy in which electromagnetic<br>
energy is delivered to the Target Area, the present<br>
invention also discloses apparatus and methods for<br>
measuring substances of interest through far infrared<br>
thermal emission from the Target Area. Yet, besides near-<br>
infrared spectroscopy and thermal emission, other means<br>
are disclosed for measurement of substances of interest<br>
at the Target Area including electroosmosis as a flux<br>
enhancement by iontophoresis or reverse iontophoresis<br>
with increased passage of fluid through the skin through<br>
application of electrical energy. Yet, transcutaneous<br>
optical means can also be integrated into support<br>
structures including medial canthal pieces, modified nose<br>
pads, and the frame of eyeglasses, with said means<br>
positioned to access the tunnel.<br>
It is understood that application of current,<br>
ultrasonic waves as well as chemical enhancers of flow,<br>
electroporation and other means can be used to increase<br>
permeation at the tunnel site such as for example<br>
increased flow of glucose with the use of alkali salts.<br>
In addition creating micro holes in the target area with<br>
a laser, or other means that penetrate the skin can be<br>
done with the subsequent placement of sensing means on<br>
the BTT site, with said means capable of measuring<br>
chemical compounds.<br>
Furthermore, reservoirs mounted on or disposed<br>
within support structures, such as the frame and pads of<br>
eyeglasses, can deliver substances transdermally' at the<br>
BTT site by various means including iontophoresis,<br>
sonophoresis, electrocompression, electroporation,<br>
chemical or physical permeation enhancers, hydrostatic<br>
pressure and the like.<br>
In addition to measure the actual amount of oxygen<br>
in blood, the present invention also discloses means to<br>
measure oxygen saturation and the amount of oxygenated<br>
hemoglobin. In this embodiment the medial canthal piece<br>
of a support structure or the modified nose pads of<br>
eyeglasses contain LEDs emitting at two wave lengths<br>
around 940 and 660 nanometers. As the blood oxygenation<br>
changes, the ratio of the light transmitted by the two<br>
frequencies changes indicating the oxygen saturation.<br>
Since the blood level is measured at the end of a<br>
physiologic brain tunnel, the amount of oxygenated<br>
hemoglobin in the arterial blood of the brain is<br>
measured, which is the most valuable and key parameter<br>
for athletic purposes and health monitoring.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
measuring biological parameters with said method<br>
including the steps of directing electromagnetic<br>
radiation at the BTT area on the skin, producing a signal<br>
corresponding to the resulting radiation and converting<br>
the signal into a value of the biological parameter<br>
measured.<br>
Besides using passive radio transmission or<br>
communication by cable; active radio transmission with<br>
active transmitters containing a microminiature battery<br>
mounted in the support structure can also be used.<br>
Passive transmitters act from energy supplied to it from<br>
an external source. The transensor transmits signals to<br>
remote locations using different frequencies indicative<br>
of the levels of biological parameters. Ultrasonic micro-<br>
circuits can also be mounted in the support structure and<br>
modulated by sensors which are capable of detecting<br>
chemical and physical changes at the Target Area. The<br>
signal may be transmitted using modulated sound signals<br>
particularly under water because sound is less attenuated<br>
by water than are radio waves.<br>
One preferred embodiment comprises a support<br>
structure including a patch adapted to be worn on or<br>
attached with adhesives to the tunnel and includes<br>
structural support, a sensor for measuring biological<br>
parameters, power source, microcontroller and<br>
transmitter. The parts can be incorporated into one<br>
system or work as individual units. The sensor is located<br>
preferably within 7 mm from the outer edge of the patch.<br>
The apparatus of the invention can include a temperature<br>
sensor located in the outer edge of the patch for sensing<br>
temperature. The transmitter, power source and other<br>
components can be of any size and can be placed in any<br>
part of the patch or can be connected to the patch as<br>
long as the sensing part is placed on the edge of the<br>
patch in accordance with the principles of the invention.<br>
The sensor in the patch is positioned on the skin<br>
adjacent to the medial canthal area (medial corner of the<br>
eye) and located about 2 mm from the medial canthal<br>
tendon. The sensor can preferably include electrically-<br>
based sensors, but non-electrical systems can be used<br>
such as chemicals that respond to changes in temperature<br>
including mylar.<br>
Besides patches, another preferred embodiment for<br>
measuring biological parameters at the physiologic tunnel<br>
includes a medial canthal pad. The medial canthal piece<br>
is a specialized structure containing sensors for<br>
accessing the tunnel and adapted to be worn on or<br>
attached to eyeglasses in apposition to the tunnel and<br>
includes structural support, a sensor for measuring<br>
biological parameters, power source, microcontroller and<br>
transmitter. The parts can be incorporated into one<br>
system or work as individual units. The sensors are<br>
positioned on the BTT area. The transmitter, power<br>
source, and other components can be placed in the medial<br>
canthal pad or in any part of the eyeglasses. A medial<br>
canthal piece or extension of nose pads of eyeglasses<br>
allow accessing the physiologic tunnel with sensing<br>
devices laying in apposition to the BTT area.<br>
The apparatus of the invention include a temperature<br>
sensor located in the medial canthal pad. For temperature<br>
measurement the sensing system is located on a skin area<br>
that includes the medial canthal corner of the eye and<br>
upper eyelid. The sensor in the medial canthal pad is<br>
preferably positioned on the skin adjacent to the medial<br>
canthal area (medial corner of the eye) . Although one of<br>
the preferred embodiments for measurement of brain<br>
temperature consists of medial canthal pads, it is<br>
understood that also included in the scope of the<br>
invention are nose pads of a geometry and size that reach<br>
the tunnel and that are equipped with temperature sensors<br>
preferably in the outer edge of said nose pads for<br>
measuring brain temperature and other functions. An<br>
oversized and modified nose pad containing sensors using<br>
a special geometry for adequate positioning at the BTT<br>
area is also included in the invention.<br>
With the disclosure of the present invention and by-<br>
using anatomic landmarks in accordance with the invention<br>
the sensor can be precisely positioned on the skin at the<br>
end of the tunnel. However, since there is no external<br>
visible indication on the skin relating to the size or<br>
geometry of the tunnel, accessory means can be used to<br>
visualize, map or measure the end of the tunnel on the<br>
skin. These accessory means may be particularly useful<br>
for fitting medial canthal pads or modified nose pads of<br>
eyeglasses.<br>
Accordingly, a infrared detector using thermocouple<br>
or thermopiles can be used as an accessory for<br>
identifying the point of maximum thermal emission and to<br>
map the area. An infrared imaging system or thermography<br>
means may be preferably used. In this instance, an<br>
optical store selling the eyeglasses can have a thermal<br>
imaging system. The optician, technician and the like<br>
take an infrared image picture or film the area, and in<br>
real time localize the tunnel of the particular user. The<br>
medial canthal pads or modified nose pads can then be<br>
adjusted to fit the particular user based on the thermal<br>
infrared imaging. The eyeglasses are fitted based on the<br>
thermal image created. This will allow customized fitting<br>
according to the individual needs of the user. Any<br>
thermography-based system can be used including some with<br>
great visual impact and resolution as a tri-dimensional<br>
color thermal wave imaging.<br>
It is also a feature of the invention to provide a<br>
method to be used for example in optical stores for<br>
locating the tunnel including the steps of measuring<br>
thermal infrared emission, producing an image based on<br>
the infrared emission, and detecting the area with the<br>
highest amount of infrared emission. Another step that<br>
can be included is adjusting sensors in support<br>
structures to match the area of highest infrared<br>
emission.<br>
One of said support structures includes the medial<br>
canthal pieces or nose pads of eyeglasses. The thermal<br>
imaging method can be used for fitting a patch, but said<br>
patch can be positioned at the tunnel by having an<br>
external indicator for lining up said indicator with a<br>
permanent anatomic landmark such as the medial corner of<br>
the eye. Although medial canthal pieces of eyeglasses can<br>
have an external indicator for precise positioning, since<br>
opticians are used to fit eyeglasses according to the<br>
anatomy of the user, the thermal imaging method can be a<br>
better fit for eyeglasses than an external indicator on<br>
the medial canthal pieces or modified nose pads of<br>
eyeglasses.<br>
The source of the signal is key for the clinical<br>
usefulness of the measurement. The brain is the key and<br>
universal indicator of the health status of the body. The<br>
signal coming from the brain or brain area provides the<br>
most clinically useful data. In accordance with another<br>
embodiment, the measurement of biological parameters will<br>
be described. The amount of sodium and other elements in<br>
sweat is a key factor for safety and performance of<br>
athletes and military, as well as health monitoring.<br>
For instance hyponatremia (decreased amount of<br>
sodium) can lead to reduced performance and even death.<br>
Hyponatremia can occur due to excess water intake,<br>
commonly occurring with intense physical activity and<br>
military training. Sweat can be considered as an<br>
ultrafiltrate of blood. The blood vessels supplying the<br>
skin on the head are branches of the central nervous<br>
system vasculature. The amount of chemical substances<br>
present in the sweat coming from those blood vessels is<br>
indicative of the amount of chemical substances present<br>
in the cerebral vasculature. For instance, sodium<br>
concentration of sweat from blood vessels in the head<br>
changes in relation to the rates of sweating. The<br>
apparatus and methods of the present invention can<br>
prevent death or harm due to water intoxication, by-<br>
providing alert signals when the levels of sodium in<br>
sweat reach a certain threshold for that particular<br>
wearer. The presence of various chemical elements, gases,<br>
electrolytes and pH of sweat and the surface of the skin<br>
can be determined by the use of suitable electrodes and<br>
suitable sensors integrated in the eyeglasses and other<br>
support structures mounted on the head or fitted on the<br>
head or face. These electrodes, preferably<br>
microelectrodes, can be sensitized by several reacting<br>
chemicals which are in the sweat or the surface of the<br>
skin. The different chemicals and substances can diffuse<br>
through suitable permeable membranes sensitizing suitable<br>
sensors.<br>
For example but not by way of limitation,<br>
electrochemical sensors can be used to measure various<br>
analytes such as glucose using a glucose oxidase sensor<br>
and the pilocarpine iontophoresis method can be used to<br>
measure electrolytes in sweat alone or in conjunction<br>
with microfluidics system. Besides the support structures<br>
of the present invention, it is also understood that<br>
other articles such as watches, clothing, footwear and<br>
the like can be adapted to measure concentration of<br>
substances such as electrolytes present in sweat, however<br>
there is reduced clinical relevance for evaluating<br>
metabolic state of an individual outside, the central<br>
nervous system.<br>
Body abnormalities may cause a change in the pH,<br>
osmolarity, and temperature of the sweat derived from<br>
brain and neck blood vessels as well as change in the<br>
concentration of substances such as acid-lactic, glucose,<br>
lipids, hormones, gases, markers, infectious agents,<br>
antigens, antibody, enzymes, electrolytes such as sodium,<br>
potassium and chloride, and the like. Eyeglasses and any<br>
head gear can be adapted to measure the concentration of<br>
substances in sweat. Microminiature glass electrodes<br>
mounted in the end portion of the temple of eyeglasses<br>
sitting behind the ear or alternatively mounted on the<br>
lens rim against the forehead can be used to detect<br>
divalent cations such as calcium, as well as sodium and<br>
potassium ion and pH. Chloride-ion detectors can be used<br>
to detect the salt concentration in the sweat and the<br>
surface of the skin.<br>
Many agents including biological warfare agents and<br>
HIV virus are present in sweat and could be detected with<br>
the eyeglasses or support structure on the head or face<br>
using sensors coated with antibodies against the agent<br>
which can create a photochemical reaction with appearance<br>
of colorimetric reaction and/or potential shift with<br>
subsequent change in voltage or temperature that can be<br>
detected and transmitted to a monitoring station or<br>
reported locally by audio or visual means.<br>
Electrocatalytic antibodies also can generate an<br>
electrical signal when there is an antigen-antibody<br>
interaction. It is also understood that other articles<br>
such as watches, clothing, footwear, and the like or any<br>
article capturing sweat can be adapted to identify<br>
antigens, antibody, infectious agents, markers (cancer,<br>
heart, genetic, metabolic, drugs, and the like) in<br>
accordance with the present invention. However,<br>
identification of those elements away from the central<br>
nervous system is of reduced clinical relevance.<br>
The different amounts of fluid encountered in sweat<br>
can be easily quantified and the concentration of<br>
substances calibrated according to the amount of fluid in<br>
sweat. The relationship between the concentration of<br>
chemical substances and molecules in the blood and the<br>
amount of said chemical substances in the sweat can be<br>
described mathematically and programmed in a computer.<br>
The present invention also includes eyeglasses or<br>
support structures in which a radio frequency transensor<br>
capable of measuring the negative resistance of nerve<br>
fibers is mounted in the eyeglasses or support structure.<br>
By measuring the electrical resistance, the effects of<br>
microorganisms, drugs, and poisons can be detected. The<br>
system also comprises eyeglasses in which a<br>
microminiature radiation-sensitive transensor is mounted<br>
in said eyeglasses or support structure.<br>
The brain has a rich vasculature and receives about<br>
15% of the resting cardiac output and due to the absence<br>
of fat the tunnel offers an area for optimal signal<br>
acquisition for evaluating hemodynamics. Accordingly,<br>
change in the viscosity of blood can be evaluated from a<br>
change in damping on a vibrating quartz micro-crystal<br>
mounted in the eyeglasses or support structure and the<br>
invention can be adapted to measure blood pressure and to<br>
provide instantaneous and continuous monitoring of blood<br>
pressure through an intact wall of a blood vessel from<br>
the brain and to evaluate hemodynamics and hydrodynamics.<br>
Also, by providing a contact microphone, arterial<br>
pressure can be measured using sonic means.<br>
Pressure can be applied to a blood vessel through a<br>
micro cuff mounted in the medial canthal pads, or<br>
alternatively by the temples of eyeglasses. Pressure can<br>
also be applied by a rigid structure, and the preferred<br>
end point is reached when sound related to blood<br>
turbulence is generated. The characteristic sound of<br>
systole  (contraction of the heart)  and diastole<br>
(relaxation of the heart) can be captured by the<br>
microphone. A microphone integrated into the medial<br>
canthal pad can be adapted to identify the heart sounds.<br>
Pressure transducers such as a capacitive pressure<br>
transducer with integral electronics for signal<br>
processing and a microphone can be incorporated in the<br>
same silicon structure and can be mounted in the medial<br>
canthal pad. Motion sensors and/or pressure sensors can<br>
be mounted in the medial canthal pad to measure pulse.<br>
Reversible mechanical expansion methods,<br>
photometric, or electrochemical methods and electrodes<br>
can be mounted in the eyeglasses or support structures of<br>
the present invention and used to detect acidity, gases,<br>
analyte concentration, and the like. Oxygen gas can also<br>
be evaluated according to its magnetic properties or be<br>
analyzed by micro-polarographic sensors mounted in the<br>
eyeglasses or other support structure. A microminiature<br>
microphone mounted in the eyeglasses or other support<br>
structure can also be adapted to detect sounds from the<br>
heart, respiration, flow, vocal and the environment,<br>
which can be sensed and transmitted to a remote receiver<br>
or reported by local audio and visual means. The sensors<br>
are adapted and positioned to monitor the biological<br>
parameters at the end of the tunnel.<br>
The eyeglasses or other support structures can also<br>
have elements which produce and radiate recognizable<br>
signals and this procedure could be used to locate and<br>
track individuals, particularly in military operations. A<br>
permanent magnet can also be mounted in the eyeglasses<br>
and used for tracking as described above. A fixed<br>
frequency transmitter can be mounted in the eyeglasses<br>
and used as a tracking device which utilizes a satellite<br>
tracking system by noting the frequency received from the<br>
fixed frequency transmitter to a passing satellite, or<br>
via Global Positioning Systems. Motion and deceleration<br>
can be detected by mounting an accelerometer in the<br>
eyeglasses. The use of eyeglasses as tracking means can<br>
be useful for locating a kidnapped individual or for<br>
rescue operations in the military, since eyeglasses are<br>
normally unsuspecting articles.<br>
The use of integrated circuits and advances<br>
occurring in transducer, power source, and signal<br>
processing technology allow for extreme miniaturization<br>
of the components which permits several sensors to be<br>
mounted in one unit.<br>
The present invention provides continuous automated<br>
brain temperature monitoring without the need for a<br>
nurse. The present invention "can identify a spike in<br>
temperature. Thus, proper diagnosis is made and therapy<br>
started in a timely fashion. Time is critical for<br>
identifying the temperature spike and organism causing<br>
the infection. Delay in identifying spike and starting<br>
therapy for the infection can lead to demise of the<br>
patient. The invention timely and automatically<br>
identifies the temperature spike and prevents the<br>
occurrence of complications.<br>
The present invention also alerts the user<br>
about overheating or hypothermia to allow:<br>
1.   Proper hydration;<br>
2.   Increased performance;<br>
3.   Increased safety; and<br>
4.   Feed back control in treadmills and other<br>
exercise machines for keeping proper hydration and<br>
performance.<br>
Annually many athletes, construction workers,<br>
college students and the general public unnecessarily die<br>
due to heatstrokes. Once the brain reaches a certain<br>
temperature level such as 40° C, an almost irreversible<br>
process ensues. Because there are no specific symptoms<br>
and after a certain point there is rapid increase in<br>
brain temperature, heatstroke has one of the highest<br>
fatality rates. The more severe and more prolonged the<br>
episode, the worse the predicted outcome, especially when<br>
cooling is delayed. Without measuring core temperature<br>
and having an alert system when the temperature falls<br>
outside safe levels it is impossible to prevent<br>
hyperthermia and heatstroke. The present invention<br>
provides means for continuous monitoring of temperature<br>
with alert systems that can prevent dangerous levels to<br>
be reached and cooling measures applied if needed. The<br>
apparatus can be adapted to be used in an unobtrusive<br>
manner by athletes, military, workers and the general<br>
population.<br>
All chemical reactions in the body are dependent on<br>
temperature. High temperature can lead to enzymatic<br>
changes and protein denaturation and low temperature can<br>
slow down vital chemical reactions. Hydration is<br>
dependent on brain temperature and loss of fluid leads to<br>
a rise in brain temperature. Minimal fluctuations in the<br>
body's temperature can adversely affect performance and<br>
increase risk of illness and of life threatening events.<br>
Therefore, it is essential that athletes, sports<br>
participants, military personnel, police officers,<br>
firefighters, forest rangers, factory workers, farmers,<br>
construction workers and other professionals have precise<br>
means to know exactly what is their brain temperature.<br>
When the core temperature rises, the blood that<br>
would otherwise be available for the muscles is used for<br>
cooling via respiration and perspiration. The body will<br>
do this automatically as temperature moves out of the<br>
preferred narrow range. It is this blood shifting that<br>
ultimately impairs physical performance and thermal<br>
induced damage to brain tissue interferes with normal<br>
cognitive function. Intense exercise can increase heat<br>
production in muscles 20 fold. In order to prevent<br>
hyperthermia and death by heat stroke athletes drink<br>
water. Because the ingestion of water is done in a random<br>
fashion, many times there is water intoxication which can<br>
lead to death as occurs to many healthy people including<br>
marathon runners and military personnel. Both, excess of<br>
water (overhydration) or lack of water (dehydration) can<br>
lead to fatal events besides reducing performance.<br>
Therefore, it is essential that individuals have precise<br>
means to know exactly when and how much to drink. By<br>
monitoring brain temperature with the present invention<br>
proper hydration can be achieved and athletes and<br>
military will know precisely when and how much water to<br>
ingest.<br>
Timely ingestion of fluids according to the core<br>
temperature allows optimization of cardiovascular<br>
function and avoidance of heat strain. Because there is a<br>
delay from the time of ingestion of fluid to absorption<br>
of said fluid by the body, the method of invention<br>
includes signaling the need for ingestion at a lower core<br>
temperature such as 38.5° C to account for that delay, and<br>
thus avoid the onset of exhaustion. The temperature<br>
threshold can be adjusted according to each individual,<br>
the physical activity, and the ambient temperature.<br>
In addition, software can be produced based on data<br>
acquired at the BTT site for optimizing fitness, athletic<br>
performance, and safety. The upper temperature limit of a<br>
particular athlete for maintaining optimal performance<br>
can be identified, and the data used to create software<br>
to guide said athlete during a competition. For instance,<br>
the athlete can be informed on the need to drink cold<br>
fluid to prevent reaching a certain temperature level<br>
which was identified as reduced performance for said<br>
athlete. Brain temperature level for optimal performance<br>
identified can be used to guide the effort of an athlete<br>
during competition and training. Hyperthermia also<br>
affects mental performance and software based on data<br>
from the BTT can be produced to optimize mental and<br>
physical performance of firefighters in an individual<br>
manner. People can have different thresholds for<br>
deleterious effects of hyperthermia and thus setting one<br>
level for all users may lead to underutilization of one's<br>
capabilities and putting others at risk of reduced<br>
performance. Likewise, exercise endurance and mental<br>
performance is markedly reduced by hypothermia and the<br>
same settings can be applied for low temperature<br>
situations. Determinations of brain temperature, oxygen<br>
and lactic acid levels can also be used for endurance<br>
training of athletes, fitness training, and to monitor<br>
the effects of training. The system, method, and<br>
apparatus of the invention provides means for enhancing<br>
safety and optimizing fitness for athletes and<br>
recreational sports participants.<br>
It is a feature of the invention to provide a method<br>
for the precise and timely intake of fluids including the<br>
steps of measuring brain temperature, reporting the<br>
signal measured, and ingesting an amount of fluid based<br>
on the signal measured. Other steps can be included such<br>
as reporting means using voice reproduction or visual<br>
means to instruct on what beverage to drink and how much<br>
to drink to reduce core temperature. It is understood<br>
that the method of the present invention can combine<br>
measurement of temperature associated with measurement of<br>
sodium in sweat or blood, in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention.<br>
Children do not tolerate heat as well as adults<br>
because their bodies generate more heat relative to their<br>
size than adults do. Children are also not as quick to<br>
adjust to changes in temperatures. In addition, children<br>
have more skin surface relative to their body size which<br>
means they lose more water through evaporation from the<br>
skin. It is understood that different sizes, shapes, and<br>
designs of medial canthal pads including children size<br>
can be used in the present invention. Children eyeglasses<br>
equipped with sensors can have a booster radio<br>
transmitter that will transmit the signal to a remote<br>
receiver and alert parents about dangerous temperature<br>
levels. The eyeglasses can be incorporated with a<br>
detecting system to send a signal if the eyeglasses were<br>
removed or if the temperature sensor is not capturing<br>
signals in a proper manner. By way of illustration, but<br>
not of limitation, pressuse sensing means can be<br>
incorporated in the end of the temples to detect if the<br>
sunglasses are being worn, and an abrupt drop in the<br>
pressure signal indicates glasses were removed or<br>
misplacement of the sensor can also generate an<br>
identifiable signal. An adhesive, a double-sided adhesive<br>
tape, or other means for increasing grip can be used in<br>
the medial canthal pads to assure more stable position.<br>
It is understood that the eyeglasses can come equipped<br>
with sensors to detect ambient temperature and humidty,<br>
which allows for precisely alerting the wearer about any<br>
aspect affecting heat conditions.<br>
In the current industrial, nuclear and military<br>
settings, personnel may be requied to wear protective<br>
clothing. Although the protective clothing prevent harm<br>
by hzaradous agents, the garments increase the rate of<br>
heat storage. It is understood that the present invention<br>
can be coupled with garments with adjustable permeability<br>
to automatically keep the core temperature within safe<br>
limits.<br>
In addition, the present invention alerts an<br>
individual about risk of thermal damage (risk of wrinkles<br>
and cancer) at the beach or during outdoor activities.<br>
When one is at the beach, watching a game in a stadium,<br>
camping or being exposed to the sun, the radiant energy<br>
of the sun is absorbed and transformed into thermal<br>
energy. The combination of the different means of heat<br>
transfer to the body lead to an increase in body<br>
temperature, which is reflected by the brain temperature.<br>
Convection and conduction can also lead to an increase in<br>
body temperature through heat transfer in the absence of<br>
sun light. The absorption of heat from the environment<br>
leads to a rise in the average kinetic energy of the<br>
molecules with subsequent increase in core temperature.<br>
The levels of core temperature is related to the<br>
risk of thermal damage to the skin. After certain levels<br>
of heat there is an increased risk of denaturing protein<br>
and breaking of collagen in the skin. This can be<br>
compared with changes that occur when frying an egg.<br>
After a certain amount of thermal radiation is delivered<br>
the egg white changes from fluidic and transparent to a<br>
hard and white structure. After the egg white reaches a<br>
certain level of temperature the structural change<br>
becomes permanent. After a certain level of increase in<br>
core temperature during sun exposure, such as a level of<br>
37.7° Celsius to 37.9° Celsius at rest (e.g.; sun<br>
bathing), thermal damage may ensue and due to the<br>
disruption of proteins and collagen there is an increased<br>
risk for wrinkle formation. The increased brain<br>
temperature correlates to the amount of thermal radiation<br>
absorbed by the body, and the duration of exposure of the<br>
temperature level times the level of temperature is an<br>
indicator of the risk of thermal damage, wrinkle<br>
formation, and skin cancer.<br>
The present invention provides an alarm system that<br>
can be set up to alert in real time when it is time to<br>
avoid sun exposure in order to prevent further absorption<br>
of thermal radiation and reduce the risk of dermatologic<br>
changes, as can occur during outdoor activities or at the<br>
beach. In addition, thermal damage to the skin prevents<br>
the skin from adequately cooling itself and can result in<br>
increasing the risk of dehydration which further<br>
increases the temperature. The present invention helps<br>
preserve the beauty and health of people exposed to sun<br>
light and during outdoor activities while allowing full<br>
enjoyment of the sun and the benefits of sun light.<br>
By the present invention, a method for timing sun<br>
exposure includes the steps of measuring body<br>
temperature, reporting the value measured and avoiding<br>
sun exposure for a certain period of time based on the<br>
level measured.<br>
Hypothermia is the number one killer in outdoor<br>
activities in the U.S. and Europe. Hypothermia also<br>
decreases athletic performance and leads to injuries. It<br>
is very difficult to detect hypothermia because the<br>
symptoms are completely vague such as loss of orientation<br>
and clumsiness which are indistinguishable from general<br>
behavior. Without measuring core temperature and having<br>
an alert system when the temperature falls outside safe<br>
levels it is impossible to prevent hypothermia due to the<br>
vague symptoms. The present invention can alert an<br>
individual about hypothermia during skiing, scuba diving,<br>
mountain climbing and hiking. The present invention<br>
provides means to precisely inform when certain<br>
temperature thresholds are met, either too high or too<br>
low temperature.<br>
The present invention continuously monitors the<br>
brain temperature and as soon as a temperature spike or<br>
fever occurs it activates diagnostics systems to detect<br>
the presence of infectious agents, which can be done<br>
locally in the BTT site, or the infectious agents can be<br>
identified in other parts of the body such as the blood<br>
stream or the eyelid pocket. The present invention can be<br>
also coupled to drug dispensing means for the automated<br>
delivery of medications in accordance with the signal<br>
produced at the BTT site including transcutaneous means,<br>
iontophoresis or by injection using a pump.<br>
The invention also includes a tool for family<br>
planning. The system can detect spike and changes in<br>
basal temperature and identify moment of ovulation and<br>
phases of the menstrual cycle. This allows a woman to<br>
plan pregnancy or avoid pregnancy. This eliminates the<br>
need for invasive devices used for monitoring time for<br>
artificial insemination not only for humans but also<br>
animals. The invention can yet detect the start of<br>
uterine contractions (parturition) and allow a safer<br>
birth for animals. Support structures can be equally<br>
used in the BTT of animals.<br>
The present invention also includes Automated<br>
Climate control according to the value measured at the<br>
BTT. The temperature of the user controls the temperature<br>
in the car. When the body starts to warm up, the signal<br>
from the apparatus of the invention automatically<br>
activates the air conditioner according to the user<br>
settings, alternatively it activates heat when the body<br>
is cold. This automation allows drivers to concentrate on<br>
the road and thus can reduce the risk for car crashes. It<br>
is understood that other articles that can affect body<br>
temperature can be controlled by the present invention<br>
including vehicle seats. Likewise, automated climate<br>
control at home, work, or any confined area can be<br>
achieved by activating the thermostat directly or via<br>
BlueTooth technology. Besides convenience and comfort,<br>
this automation allows saving energy since gross changes<br>
manually done in the thermostat leads to great energy<br>
expenditure.<br>
It is understood that any body temperature measuring<br>
system can provide automated climate control or adjust<br>
temperature of articles in accordance with the principles<br>
of the present invention.<br>
The present invention yet includes methods for<br>
reducing weight. It includes monitoring of temperature<br>
during programs for weight reduction based on increasing<br>
body heat to reduce said weight. The system alerts<br>
athletes on a weight losing program to prevent injury or<br>
death by overheating. The system can monitor temperature<br>
of people in sauna, steam rooms, spas and the like as<br>
part of weight reduction programs in order to prevent<br>
injuries and enhance results.<br>
Yet, methods to enhance memory and performance<br>
besides preserving health by providing an automated<br>
mechanism to control ambient temperature and surrounding<br>
body temperature based on the brain temperature measured<br>
by the present invention. Human beings spent about one<br>
third of their lives sleeping. Many changes in body<br>
temperature occur during sleep. All of the metabolism and<br>
enzymatic reactions in the body are dependent on adequate<br>
level of temperature. The adequate control of ambient<br>
temperature which matches the needs of body temperature<br>
such as during sleeping have a key effect on metabolism.<br>
Adequate ambient temperature and surrounding temperature<br>
of objects which matches body temperature allow not only<br>
for people to sleep better, but also to achieve improved<br>
efficiency of enzymatic reactions which leads to improved<br>
mental ability and improved immune response. A variety of<br>
devices such as blankets, clothing, hats, mattress,<br>
pillows, or any article touching the body or in the<br>
vicinity of the body can be adapted to automatically<br>
increase or decrease temperature of said articles<br>
according to the temperature signal from the present<br>
invention.<br>
The body naturally becomes cooler during the night<br>
and many people have restless sleep and turn continuously<br>
in bed because of that temperature effect. Since the<br>
tossing and turning occurs as involuntary movements and<br>
the person is not awake, said person cannot change the<br>
stimuli such as for instance increasing room temperature<br>
or increasing temperature of an electric blanket. The<br>
present invention automatically changes the ambient<br>
temperature or temperature of articles to match the<br>
temperature needs of the person. This is particularly<br>
useful for infants, elderly, diabetics, neuro- disorders,<br>
heart disease, and a variety of other conditions, since<br>
this population has reduced neurogenic response to<br>
changes in body temperature, and said population could<br>
suffer more during the night, have increased risk of<br>
complications besides decreased productivity due to sleep<br>
deprivation.<br>
The invention also provides means and methods to be<br>
used with bio feedback activities. A brain temperature<br>
signal from the sensor at the BTT site produces a<br>
feedback signal as an audio tone or visual display<br>
indicating temperature and a series of tones or colors<br>
identify if the brain temperature is increasing (faster<br>
frequency and red) or decreasing (lower frequency and<br>
blue). The display means can be connected by wires to the<br>
support structure holding the sensor at the BTT site.<br>
Head cooling does not change brain<br>
temperature. Athletes, military, firefighters,<br>
construction workers and others are at risk of heatstroke<br>
despite pouring cold water on their head or using a fan.<br>
Medically speaking that is a dangerous situation because<br>
the cool feeling sensed in the head is interpreted as<br>
internal cooling and the physical activity is maintained,<br>
when in reality the brain remains at risk of thermal<br>
induced damage and heatstroke. Other medical challenges<br>
related to temperature disturbances concern response<br>
time. The brain has a slower recovery response to<br>
temperature changes than core temperature (internal<br>
temperature measured in rectum, bladder, esophagus, and<br>
other internal means). Thus, internal measurement may<br>
indicate stable temperature while the brain temperature<br>
remains outside safe levels, with risk of induced damage<br>
to cerebral tissue, either due to hypothermia or<br>
hyperthermia. The only medically acceptable way to<br>
prevent cerebral tissue damage due to temperature<br>
disturbances is by continuous monitoring brain<br>
temperature as provided by the present invention.<br>
The present invention utilizes a plurality of active<br>
or passive sensors incorporated in support structures for<br>

producing a signal corresponding to the thermal emission<br>

temperature level. The invention also includes means and<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION  OF  THE  PREFERRED  EMBODIMENTS<br>
In describing a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention illustrated in the drawings, specific<br>
terminology will be resorted to for the sake of clarity.<br>
However, the invention is not intended to be limited to<br>
the specific terms so selected, and it is to be<br>
understood that each specific term includes all technical<br>
equivalents which operate in a similar manner to<br>
accomplish a similar purpose.<br>
FIG. 1A shows a thermal infrared image of the human<br>
face showing a physiologic tunnel. The figure shows an<br>
image of the end of the brain temperature tunnel (BTT)<br>
depicted as white bright spots in the medial canthal area<br>
and the medial half of the upper eyelid. The end of the<br>
BTT on the skin has special geometry, borders, and<br>
internal areas and the main entry point is located on the<br>
supero-medial aspect of the medial canthal area<br>
diametrically in position with the inferior portion of<br>
the upper eyelid and 4 mm medial to the medial corner of<br>
the eye. From there the boundary goes down in the medial<br>
canthal area diametrically in position with the medial<br>
corner of the eye and within 5 mm down from the medial<br>
corner of the eye, and proceeding up to the upper eyelid<br>
with the lateral boundary beginning at the mid-part of<br>
the upper eyelid as a narrow area and extending laterally<br>
in a fan-like shape with the superior boundary beginning<br>
in the mid-half of the upper eyelid.<br>
The scale indicates the range of temperature found<br>
in the human face. The hottest spots are indicated by the<br>
brightest white spots and the coldest areas are black,<br>
temperature between the hottest and coldest areas are<br>
seen in different hues in a gray scale. The nose is cold<br>
(seen as black) since it is primarily composed of<br>
cartilage and bones, and consequently has a lower blood<br>
volume. That is the reason why frostbite is most common<br>
in the nose.<br>
The surrounding periocular area of the upper and<br>
lower eyelids (seen as gray) is hotter because of high<br>
vascularization and the reduced amount of adipose tissue.<br>
The skin underneath the eyelids is very thin and does not<br>
have adipose tissue either. However, the other conditions<br>
necessary to define a brain temperature tunnel are not<br>
present in this area.<br>
The BTT requirements also include the presence of a<br>
terminal branch to deliver the total amount of heat, a<br>
terminal branch that is a direct branch from a vessel<br>
from the brain, a terminal branch that is superficially<br>
located to avoid far-infrared radiation absorption by<br>
other structures, and no thermoregulatory arteriovenous<br>
shunts. Thus, the BTT, i.e., the skin area in the medial<br>
corner of the eye and upper eyelid, is the unique<br>
location that can access a brain temperature tunnel. The<br>
skin around the eyelids delivers undisturbed signals for<br>
chemical measurements using spectroscopy and is defined<br>
as a metabolic tunnel with optimal acquisition of signals<br>
for chemical evaluation, but not for evaluation of the<br>
total radiant power of the brain.<br>
FIG. 1B is a computer generated thermal infrared<br>
color plot image of the human face showing in detail the<br>
geometry and different areas of the brain temperature<br>
tunnel and surrounding areas. Only few creatures such as<br>
some beetles and rattle snakes can see this type of<br>
radiation, but not humans. The infrared images make the<br>
invisible into visible. Thus the geometry and size of the<br>
tunnel can be better quantified. The color plot of the<br>
isothermal lines show the peripheral area of the tunnel<br>
in red and the central area in yellow-white with the main<br>
entry point at the end of the BTT located in the supero-<br>
medial aspect of the medial canthal area above the medial<br>
canthal tendon.<br>
The main entry point is the area of most optimal<br>
signal acquisition. The image also shows the symmetry of<br>
thermal energy between the two BTT sites. Since other<br>
areas including the forehead do not have the<br>
aforementioned six characteristics needed to define a<br>
BTT, said areas have lower total radiant power seen as<br>
light and dark green. Thus the forehead is not suitable<br>
to measure total radiant power. The whole nose has very<br>
little radiant power seen as blue and purple areas, and<br>
the tip of the nose seen as brown has the lowest<br>
temperature of the face. Thus, the nose area is not<br>
suitable for measuring biological parameters.<br>
FIG. 2A is a schematic diagram of a physiologic<br>
tunnel, more particularly a Brain Temperature Tunnel.<br>
From a physical standpoint, the BTT is a brain thermal<br>
energy tunnel characterized by a high total radiant power<br>
and high heat flow and can be characterized as a Brain<br>
Thermal Energy tunnel. The tunnel stores thermal energy<br>
and provides an undisturbed path for conveying thermal<br>
energy from one end of the tunnel in the cavernous sinus<br>
inside of the brain to the opposite end on the skin with<br>
the thermal energy transferred to the surface of the skin<br>
at the end of the tunnel in the form of far-infrared<br>
radiation. High heat flow occurs at the end of tunnel<br>
which is characterized by a thin interface, and the heat<br>
flow is inversely proportional to the thickness of the<br>
interface.<br>
The total radiated power (P) at the end of the<br>
tunnel is defined by P = o*e*A*T4, where o is the Stefan-<br>
Boltzman constant with a value o = 5.67 x 10-8 W.m-2.K-4<br>
and e is the emissivity of the area. Since the end of the<br>
tunnel provides an optimal area for radiation, the total<br>
power radiated grows rapidly as the temperature of the<br>
brain increases because of the T4 term in the equation. As<br>
demonstrated in the experiments in the present invention<br>
mentioned, the radiated power in the BTT occurred at a<br>
faster rate than the radiated power in the tongue and<br>
oral cavity.<br>
The BTT site on the skin is a very small area<br>
measuring only less than 0.5% of the body surface area.<br>
However, this very small skin region of the body provides<br>
the area for the optimal signal acquisition for measuring<br>
both physical and chemical parameters.<br>
FIG. 2A shows the brain 10 with the thermal energy<br>
12 stored in its body. The BTT 2 0 include the brain 10,<br>
the thermal energy stored in the brain 12, the thermal<br>
energy stored in the tunnel 14 and the thermal energy 16<br>
transferred to the exterior at the end of the tunnel. The<br>
thermal energy 12, 14, 16 is represented by dark arrows<br>
of same size and shape. The arrows have the same size<br>
indicating undisturbed thermal energy from one end of the<br>
tunnel to the other and characterized by equivalent<br>
temperature within the tunnel.<br>
Thermal energy from the sinus cavernous in the brain<br>
10 is transferred to the end of the tunnel 16 and a rapid<br>
rate of heat transfer occurs through the unimpeded<br>
cerebral venous blood path. The tunnel also has a wall 18<br>
representing the wall of the vasculature storing the<br>
thermal energy with equivalent temperature and serving as<br>
a conduit from the inside of the body 10 to the exterior<br>
(skin surface) 19 which ends as a terminal vessel 17<br>
transferring the total amount of thermal energy to said<br>
skin 19.<br>
The skin 19 is very thin and allows high heat flow.<br>
The thickness of skin 19 is negligible compared to the<br>
skin 39, 49 in non-tunnel areas 30 and 40 respectively.<br>
Due to the characteristics of skin 19, high heat flow<br>
occurs and thermal equilibrium is achieved rapidly when a<br>
sensor is placed on the skin 19 at the end of the BTT 20.<br>
In other areas of skin in the face and in the body<br>
in general, and in the exemplary non-tunnel areas 3 0 and<br>
4 0 of FIG. 2 several interfering phenomena occur besides<br>
the lack of direct vasculature connection to the brain,<br>
and includes self-absorption and thermal gradient. 1.<br>
Self-absorption: This relates to the phenomena that deep<br>
layers of tissue selectively absorb wavelengths of<br>
infrared energy prior to emission at the surface. The<br>
amount and type of infrared energy self-absorbed is<br>
unknown. At the surface those preferred emissions are<br>
weak due to self-absorption by the other layers deriving<br>
disordered thermal emission and insignificant spectral<br>
characteristic of the substance being analyzed being<br>
illustratively represented by the various size, shapes<br>
and orientations of arrows 34a to 36g and 44a to 46g of<br>
FIG.2. Self-absorption in non-tunnel areas thus naturally<br>
prevents useful thermal emission for measurement to be<br>
delivered at the surface. 2. Thermal gradient: there is a<br>
thermal gradient with the deeper layers being warmer than<br>
the superficial layers, illustratively represented by<br>
thicker arrows 36d and 46d in the deeper layers compared<br>
to thinner arrows 3 6e and 4 6e located more superficially.<br>
There is excessive and highly variable scattering of<br>
photons when passing through various layers such as fat<br>
and other tissues such as muscles leading to thermal<br>
loss.<br>
Contrary to that, the tunnel area 20 is homogeneous<br>
with no absorption of infrared energy and the blood<br>
vessels are located on the surface. This allows<br>
undisturbed delivery of infrared energy to the surface of<br>
the skin 19 and to a temperature detector such as an<br>
infrared detector placed in apposition to said skin 19.<br>
In the BTT area there is no thermal gradient since there<br>
is only a thin layer of tissue 19 with terminal blood<br>
vessel 17 directly underneath said thin interface skin<br>
19. The thermal energy 16 generated by the terminal blood<br>
vessel 17 exiting to the surface skin 19 corresponds to<br>
the undisturbed brain (true core) temperature of the<br>
body. The preferred path for achieving thermal<br>
equilibrium with brain tissue temperature is through the<br>
central venous system which exits the brain and enters<br>
the orbit as the superior ophthalmic vein. The arterial<br>
blood is 0.2 to 0.3 degrees Celsius lower when compared<br>
to the central venous blood, and said arterial blood is<br>
not the actual equivalent of the brain temperature. Thus<br>
although arterial blood may be of interest in certain<br>
occasions, the venous system is the preferred carrier of<br>
thermal energy for measurement of . brain temperature.<br>
Arterial blood temperature may be of interest to<br>
determine possible brain cooling by the arterial blood in<br>
certain circumstances.<br>
Non-tunnel areas 30 and 40 are characterized by the<br>
presence of heat absorbing elements. The non-tunnel areas<br>
3 0 and 4 0 are defined by broken lines characterizing the<br>
vulnerability of interference by heat absorbing<br>
constituents and by the disorganized transferring of heat<br>
in said non-tunnel areas 3 0 and 40. Various layers and<br>
other constituents in non-tunnel areas 30 and 4 0<br>
selectively absorb infrared energy emitted by the deeper<br>
layers before said energy reaches the surface of skin,<br>
and the different thermal energy and the different areas<br>
are represented by the different shapes and sizes of<br>
arrows and arrows heads.<br>
Non-tunnel area 3 0 can be representative of<br>
measuring temperature with a sensor on top of the skin<br>
anatomically located above the heart 32. White arrows 34<br>
represent the thermal energy in the heart 32. Non-tunnel<br>
area 30 includes the heart 32 and the various blood<br>
vessels and its branches 36a, 36b, 36c, 36d storing<br>
therma1 energy.<br>
Different amounts of heat are transferred and<br>
different temperatures measured depending on the location<br>
and anatomy of blood vessels 36a, 36b, 36c. The blood<br>
vessels branch out extensively from the main trunk<br>
34a.The non-tunnel area 30 also includes heat absorbing<br>
structures 37 such as bone and muscles which thermal<br>
energy 34 from the heart 3 2 need to be traversed to reach<br>
the skin 39. The non-tunnel area 30 also includes a<br>
variable layer of fat tissue 38 which further absorbs<br>
thermal energy. The reduced amount of thermal energy<br>
reaching the skin surface 3 9 due to the presence of fat<br>
38 is represented by the arrows 36d and 36e, in which<br>
arrow 36d has higher temperature than arrow 36e. Non-<br>
tunnel area 30 also includes a thick skin 39 with low<br>
heat flow represented by arrows 36f.<br>
The thick skin 3 9 corresponds to the skin in the<br>
chest area and fat layer 3 8 corresponds to the variable<br>
amount of fat present in the chest area. Arrows 36g<br>
represent the disordered and reduced total radiant power<br>
delivered after said thermal energy traverses the<br>
interfering constituents in the non-tunnel area including<br>
a thick interface and heat absorbing structures. In<br>
addition, BTT 2 0 has no fat layer as found in non-tunnel<br>
areas 30 and 40. Lack of a thick interface such as thick<br>
skin and fat, lack of thermal barriers such as fat, and<br>
lack of heat absorbing elements such as muscles allows<br>
undisturbed emission of radiation at the end of the BTT.<br>
Lack of a thick interface such as thick skin and fat,<br>
lack of thermal barriers such as fat, and lack of heat<br>
absorbing elements such as muscles allowed undisturbed<br>
emission of radiation at the end of the BTT.<br>
Yet referring to FIG. 2, non-tunnel area 40 can be<br>
representative of measuring temperature with a sensor on<br>
top of the skin in the arm 42. The heat transfer in non-<br>
tunnel area 40 has some similarity with non-tunnel area<br>
3 0 in which the end result is a disordered and reduced<br>
total radiant power not representative of the temperature<br>
at the opposite end internally. The blood vessels branch<br>
out extensively from the main trunk 44a. Thermal energy<br>
and temperature in blood vessels 46a, 46b, 46c is<br>
different than in areas 36a, 36b, 36c. The structures<br>
that thermal energy 44 needs to traverse to reach the<br>
skin are also different compared to non-tunnel 30. The<br>
amount of heat absorbing structures 47 is different and<br>
thus the end temperature at non-tunnel 4 0 is also<br>
different when compared to non-tunnel area 30. The amount<br>
of fat 48 also varies which changes the energy in areas<br>
area 46d and 46e, wherein 46d is deeper than area 46e.<br>
Thick skin 4 9 also reduces heat flow and the temperature<br>
of the area 46f. Reduction of radiant power indicated by<br>
arrow 46g when compared to radiant power 3 6g is usually<br>
quite different, so different skin temperature is<br>
measured depending on the area of the body. This applies<br>
to the whole skin surface of the body, with the exception<br>
of the skin at the end of the BTT.<br>
Measurements of internal temperature such as rectal<br>
do not have the same clinical relevance as measurement in<br>
the brain. Selective brain cooling has been demonstrated<br>
in a number of mammalian species under laboratory<br>
conditions and the same process could occur in humans.<br>
For instance the temperature in bladder and rectum may be<br>
quite different than the brain. High or low temperature<br>
in the brain may not be reflected in the temperature<br>
measured in other internal organs.<br>
FIG. 2B is a cross-sectional schematic diagram of<br>
the human head 9 showing the brain 10, spinal cord 10a,<br>
the tunnel 2 0 represented by the superior ophthalmic<br>
vein, the cavernous sinus 1, which is the thermal energy<br>
storage compartment for the brain, and the various<br>
insulating barriers 2, 2a, 3, 4, 4a, 4b, 5 that keep the<br>
brain as a completely thermally insulated structure.<br>
Insulating barriers include skin 2 corresponding to the<br>
scalp, skin 2a corresponding to the skin covering the<br>
face, fat 3 covering the whole surface of the skull and<br>
face, skull bone 4, spinal bone 4a surrounding spinal<br>
cord 10a, facial bone 4b covering the face, and cerebral<br>
spinal fluid (CSF) 5. The combined thickness of barriers<br>
2,3,4,5 insulating the brain can reach 1.5 cm to 2.0 cm,<br>
which is a notable thickness and the largest single<br>
barrier against the environment in the whole body. Due to<br>
this completely confined environment the brain cannot<br>
remove heat efficiently and heat loss occurs at a very<br>
lower rate. Skin 2 corresponds to the scalp which is the<br>
skin and associated structure covering the skull and<br>
which has low thermal conductivity and works as an<br>
insulator. Fat tissue 3 absorbs the majority of the far-<br>
infrared wavelength and works as a thermal buffer. Skull<br>
bone 4 has low thermal conductivity and the CSF works as<br>
a physical buffer and has zero heat production.<br>
The heat generated by metabolic rate in the brain<br>
corresponds to 20% of the total heat produced by the body<br>
and this enormous amount of heat is kept in a confined<br>
and thermally sealed space. Brain tissue is the most<br>
susceptible tissue to thermal energy induced damage, both<br>
high and low levels of thermal energy. Because of the<br>
thermal insulation and physical inability of the brain to<br>
gain heat or lose heat, both hypothermic (cold) and<br>
hyperthermic (hot) states can lead to brain damage and<br>
death can rapidly ensue, as occur to thousands of healthy<br>
people annually besides seizures and death due to high<br>
fever in sick people. Unless appropriate and timely<br>
warning is provided by continuously monitoring brain<br>
temperature anyone affected by cold or hot disturbances<br>
is at risk of thermal induced damage to the brain.<br>
FIG. 2B also shows a notably small entry point 20a<br>
measuring less than 0.5% of the body surface which<br>
corresponds to the end of the tunnel 2 0 on the skin 2b.<br>
The skin 2b is extremely thin with a thickness of 1 mm or<br>
less compared to the skin 2 and 2a which are five fold or<br>
more, thicker than skin 2b.<br>
The tunnel 20 starts at the cavernous sinus 1 which<br>
is a conduit for venous drainage for the brain and for<br>
heat transfer at the end of the tunnel 2 0 as a radiant<br>
energy. Tunnel 20 provides an obstructed passage to the<br>
cavernous sinus 1, a structure located in the middle of<br>
the brain, and which is in direct contact with the two<br>
sources of heat to the brain: 1) thermal energy produced<br>
due to metabolic rate by the brain and carried by the<br>
venous system; and 2) thermal energy delivered by the<br>
arterial supply from the rest of the body to the brain.<br>
This direct contact arrangement is showed in detail in<br>
FIG. 2C, which is a coronal section of FIG. 2B<br>
corresponding to the line marked "A".<br>
FIG. 2C is a coronal section through the cavernous<br>
sinus 1 which is a cavity-like structure with multiple<br>
spaces la filled with venous blood from the veins 9 and<br>
from the superior ophthalmic vein 6. Cavernous sinus 1<br>
collects thermal energy from brain tissue 7, from<br>
arterial blood of the right and left internal carotid<br>
arteries 8a, 8b, and from venous blood from vein 9. All<br>
of the structures 7, 8a, 8b, 9 are disposed along and in<br>
intimate contact with the cavernous sinus 1. A particular<br>
feature that makes the cavernous sinus 1 of the tunnel a<br>
very useful gauge for temperature disturbances is the<br>
intimate association with the carotid arteries 8a, 8b.<br>
The carotid arteries carry the blood from the body, and<br>
the amount of thermal energy delivered to the brain by<br>
said vessels can lead to a state of hypothermia or<br>
hyperthermia. For instance during exposure to cold, the<br>
body is cold and cold blood from the body is carried to<br>
the brain by internal carotid arteries 8a, 8b, and the<br>
cavernous sinus 1 is the entry point of those vessels 8a,<br>
8b to the brain.<br>
As soon as cold blood reaches the cavernous sinus 1<br>
the corresponding thermal energy state is transferred to<br>
the tunnel and to the skin surface at the end of the<br>
tunnel, providing therefore an immediate alert even<br>
before the cold blood is distributed throughout the<br>
brain. The same applies to hot blood for instance<br>
generated during exercise which can lead to a 20 fold<br>
heat production compared to baseline. This heat carried<br>
by vessels 8a, 8b is transferred to the cavernous sinus 1<br>
and can be measured at the end of the tunnel. In<br>
addition, the thermal energy generated by the brain is<br>
carried by cerebral venous blood and the cavernous sinus<br>
1 is a structure filled with venous blood.<br>
FIG. 3A is a thermal infrared image of the human<br>
face in which the geometry of the end of the tunnel on<br>
the skin can be visualized. The white bright spots define<br>
the central area of the tunnel. FIG. 3B is a schematic<br>
diagram of an exemplary geometry on the skin surface at<br>
the end of the tunnel. The medial aspect 52 of the tunnel<br>
50 has a round shape. The lateral aspect 54 borders the<br>
upper lid margin 58 and caruncle 56 of the eye 60. The<br>
tunnel extends from the medial canthal area 52 into the<br>
upper eyelid 62 in a horn like projection.<br>
The internal areas of the tunnel 50 include the<br>
general area for the main entry point and the main entry<br>
point as shown in FIGS. 4A to 5D. FIG. 4A is a thermal<br>
infrared image of the side of the human face showing a<br>
general view of the main entry point of the brain<br>
temperature tunnel, seen as white bright points located<br>
medial and above the medial canthal corner. FIG. 4B is a<br>
diagram showing the general area 7 0 of the main entry<br>
point and its relationship to the eye 60, medial canthal<br>
corner 61, eyebrow 64, and nose 66.The general area 70 of<br>
the main entry point provides an area with more faithful<br>
reproduction of the brain temperature since the area 70<br>
has less interfering elements than the peripheral area of<br>
the tunnel.<br>
FIG. 5A is a thermal infrared image of the front of<br>
the human face with the right eye closed showing the main<br>
entry point of the brain temperature tunnel seen as white<br>
bright spots above and medial to the medial canthal<br>
corner. With closed eyes it is easy to observe that the<br>
radiant power is coming solely from the skin at the end<br>
of BTT.<br>
FIG. 5B is a diagram showing the main entry point 80<br>
and its relationship to the medial canthal corner 61 of<br>
closed eye 60 and eyelids 62. The main entry point 80 of<br>
the tunnel provides the area with the most faithful<br>
reproduction of the brain temperature since the area 80<br>
has the least amount of interfering elements and is<br>
universally present in all human beings at an equivalent<br>
anatomical position. The main entry point 80 has the<br>
highest total radiant power and has a surface with high<br>
emissivity. The main entry point 80 is located on the<br>
skin in the superior aspect of the medial canthal area<br>
63, in the supero-medial aspect of the medial canthal<br>
corner 61.<br>
FIG. 5C is a thermal infrared image of the side of<br>
the human face in FIG. 5A with the left eye closed<br>
showing a side view of the main entry point of the brain<br>
temperature tunnel, seen as bright white spots. It can be<br>
observed with closed eyes that the radiant power is<br>
coming solely from the skin at the end of BTT.<br>
FIG. 5D shows the main entry point 80 in the<br>
superior aspect of the medial canthal area above the<br>
medial canthal corner 61, and also shows the position of<br>
main entry point 80 in relation to the eye 60, eyebrow 64<br>
and nose 66. Support structures can precisely position<br>
sensing means on top of the main entry point of the<br>
tunnel because the main entry point is completely<br>
demarcated by anatomic landmarks. In general the sensor<br>
is positioned on the medial canthal skin area above the<br>
medial canthal corner and adjacent to the eye. Although<br>
indicators can be placed on support structures to better<br>
guide the positioning of the sensor, the universal<br>
presence of the various permanent anatomic landmarks<br>
allows the precise positioning by any non-technical<br>
person.<br>
The main entry point is the preferred location for<br>
the positioning of the sensor by the support structure,<br>
but the placement of a sensor in any part of the end of<br>
the tunnel including the general entry point area and<br>
peripheral area provides clinically useful measurements<br>
depending on the application. The degree of precision<br>
needed for the measurement will determine the positioning<br>
of the sensor. In cases of neurosurgery, cardiovascular<br>
surgery, or other surgical procedure in which the patient<br>
is at high risk of hypothermia or malignant hyperthermia,<br>
the preferred position of the sensor is at the main entry<br>
point. For recreational or professional sports, military,<br>
workers, fever detection at home, wrinkle protection in<br>
sunlight, and the like, positioning the sensor in any<br>
part of the end of the tunnel area provides the precision<br>
needed for clinical usefulness.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, FIG. 6 is<br>
a schematic view of the face showing the general area of<br>
the main entry point of the tunnel 90 and the overall<br>
area of the end of the tunnel and its relationship to the<br>
medial canthal tendon 67. The end of the tunnel includes<br>
the general main entry point area 90 and the upper eyelid<br>
area 94. The area 90 has a peripheral portion 92. Both<br>
medial canthal areas have a medial canthal tendon and the<br>
left eye is used to facilitate the illustration. The<br>
medial canthal tendon 67 arises at the medial canthal<br>
corner 61 of eye 60. The left medial canthal tendon 67 is<br>
diametrically opposed to the right medial canthal tendon<br>
as shown by broken lines 61a which begins at the medial<br>
corner of the eye 61. Although the main entry point is<br>
above the medial canthal tendon 67, some of the<br>
peripheral area 92 of the tunnel is located below tendon<br>
67.<br>
Fig. 6A is a schematic diagram showing two<br>
physiologic tunnels. The upper figure shows the area<br>
corresponding to the BTT 10. The lower figure shows an<br>
area corresponding to a metabolic tunnel 13 which<br>
includes the upper eyelid area 13a and lower eyelid area<br>
13b seen as light blue areas in FIG. 1B. For measuring<br>
the concentration of chemical substances the total<br>
radiant power is not mandatory. The key aspect for<br>
clinical useful spectroscopic measurements is signal<br>
coming from the cerebral area and the reduction or<br>
elimination of interfering constituents, and the main<br>
interfering constituent is adipose tissue. By removing<br>
adipose tissue and receiving spectral information carried<br>
by a vasculature from the brain, precise and clinical<br>
measurements can be achieved. The sensors supported by<br>
support structure are adapted to have a field of view<br>
that matches in total or in part the metabolic tunnel 13<br>
for capturing thermal radiation from said tunnel 13.<br>
To determine the thermal stability of the tunnel<br>
area in relation to environmental changes, cold and heat<br>
challenge tests were performed. FIGS. 7A and 7B are<br>
thermal infrared images of an exemplary experiment<br>
showing the human face before and after cold challenge.<br>
In FIG. 7A the face has a lighter appearance when<br>
compared to FIG. 7B which is darker indicating a lower<br>
temperature. The nose in FIG. 7A has an overall whitish<br>
appearance as compared to the nose in FIG. 7B which has<br>
an overall darker appearance. Since the areas outside the<br>
tunnel have thermoregulatory arteriovenous shunts and<br>
interfering constituents including fat, the changes in<br>
the temperature of the environment are reflected in said<br>
areas. Thus measurements in those non-tunnel areas of the<br>
face reflect the environment instead of the actual body<br>
temperature. The non-tunnel areas of the skin in the face<br>
and body can change with the changes in ambient<br>
temperature. The radiant power of the tunnel area remains<br>
stable and there is no change in the amount of thermal<br>
energy demonstrating the stability of the thermal<br>
emission of the area. Changes of thermal radiation at<br>
the tunnel area only occur when the brain temperature<br>
changes, which provides the most reliable measurement of<br>
the thermal status of the body.<br>
FIGS. 8A and 8B are thermal infrared images of the<br>
human face of different subjects showing the tunnel seen<br>
as bright white spots in the medial canthal area. The<br>
physiologic tunnel is universally present in all<br>
individuals despite anatomic variations and ethnic<br>
differences. FIGS. 9A and 9B are thermal infrared image<br>
showing that the tunnel seen as bright white spots are<br>
equally present in animals, illustrated here by a cat<br>
(FIG. 9A) and a dog (FIG. 9B).<br>
A preferred embodiment includes a temperature sensor<br>
with measurement processing electronics housed in a<br>
patch-like support structure which positions a passive<br>
sensor directly in contact with the skin over the brain<br>
temperature tunnel site. Accordingly, FIG. 10 is a<br>
perspective view of a preferred embodiment showing a<br>
person 100 wearing a support structure comprised of a<br>
patch 72 with a passive sensor 74 positioned on the skin<br>
at the end of the tunnel. Person 100 is laying on a<br>
mattress 76 which contains antenna 78. Wire 82 extends<br>
from antenna 78 to controller unit 84 with said<br>
controller 84 communicating with device 88 by<br>
communication line 86. Exemplary device 88 includes a<br>
decoding and display unit at the bedside or at the<br>
nursing station. It is understood that controller unit 84<br>
besides communicating by cable 86, can also contain<br>
wireless transmission means to wirelessly transmit the<br>
signal acquired to a remote station. This inductive radio<br>
frequency powered telemetry system can use the same<br>
antenna 78 to transfer energy and to receive the signal.<br>
The antenna 78 can be secured to a mattress, pillow,<br>
frame of a bed, and the like in a removable or permanent<br>
manner. The preferred embodiment includes a thin flat<br>
antenna encapsulated by a flexible polymer that is<br>
secured to a mattress and is not visible to the user.<br>
Alternatively an antenna can be placed in any area<br>
surrounding the patient, such as on a night stand.<br>
The antenna 78 and controller unit 84 works as a<br>
receiver/interrogator. A receiver/interrogator antenna 78<br>
causes RF energy to radiate to the microcircuit in the<br>
patch 72. This energy would be stored and converted for<br>
use in the temperature measurement process and in the<br>
transmission of the data from the patch 72 to the antenna<br>
78. Once sufficient energy has been transferred, the<br>
microcircuit makes the measurement and transmits that<br>
data to the receiver/interrogator antenna 78 with said<br>
data being processed at controller 84 and further<br>
communicated to device 88 for display or further<br>
transmission. The switching elements involved in the<br>
acquisition of the sensor data (measurement of the<br>
energy) is done in a sequence so that the quantized<br>
answer is available and stored prior to the activation of<br>
the noise-rich transmission signal. Thus the two<br>
inherently incompatible processes successfully coexist<br>
because they are not active simultaneously.<br>
The capability of the RF link to communicate in the<br>
presence of noise is accomplished by "spreading" the<br>
spectral content of the transmitted energy in a way that<br>
would inherently add redundancy to the transmission while<br>
reducing the probability that the transmission can ever<br>
be interpreted by the receiver/interrogator 78 as another<br>
transmission or noise that would cause the<br>
receiver/interrogator 78 to transmit and display<br>
incorrect information. This wireless transmission scheme<br>
can be implemented with very few active elements. The<br>
modulation purposely spreads the transmission energy<br>
across the spectrum and thus provides noise immunity and<br>
the system can be ultimately be produced via batch<br>
processing and thus at a very low cost.<br>
Since the energy to operate sensor 74 in patch 72<br>
comes from the antenna 78, the microcircuit in said patch<br>
72 can be very small and ultra-thin. Size of the patch 72<br>
would be further minimized to extremely small dimensions<br>
by the design approach that places all the processing<br>
function of the RF link in the controller unit 84 working<br>
as a receiver. RF messaging protocol and the control of<br>
the sensor 74 resides in the receiver/interrogator<br>
controller 84 powered by commercially available batteries<br>
or by AC current. Thus the RF messaging protocol and the<br>
control of the sensor 74 is directly controlled by the<br>
MCU of controller 84 . The circuit resident in the patch<br>
72 is preferably completely self-contained. The sensing<br>
system 74 in the patch 72 is preferably a silicon<br>
microcircuit containing the circuits needed to support<br>
the sensor, quantatize the data from the sensor, encode<br>
the data for radio frequency transmission, and transmit<br>
the data, besides power conditioning circuits and digital<br>
state control. Sensor, support circuitry, RF power and<br>
communications are all deposited on a micro-chip die<br>
allowing the circuit to be built in large quantities and<br>
at very low cost. This scheme is preferably used for both<br>
passive and active devices.<br>
The operational process can consist of two modes,<br>
manual or automated. In the manual mode, an operator such<br>
as a nurse activates the system and RF energy radiated to<br>
the microcircuit in the patch 72 would be stored and<br>
converted for use in the temperature measurement process<br>
and in the transmission of the data from the end of the<br>
BTT to the antenna 78. Once sufficient energy has been<br>
transferred (less than 1 second) the microcircuit would<br>
make the measurement and transmit the data to the antenna<br>
78 receiver and controller 84 to be displayed for example<br>
on a back-lit LCD display at the nursing station. An<br>
audio "beep" will signal that the data had been received<br>
and is ready for view. In the automated mode, the process<br>
is done automatically and continuously by interrogation<br>
at preset frequency and an alarm being activated when the<br>
reading is outside the specified range. A tri-dimensional<br>
antenna can also be used and the controller 84 set up to<br>
search the three dimensions of the antenna to assure<br>
continued and proper connection between antenna 78 and<br>
sensing means 74. It is also understood that the sensor<br>
can modulate reflected RF energy. Accordingly, the<br>
energy will trigger the unit to acquire a temperature<br>
measurement, and then the unit will modulate the<br>
reflected energy. This reflected energy and information<br>
will be received at the interrogator and displayed as<br>
above.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
monitoring biological parameters, which comprises the<br>
steps of: securing a passive sensor to the body;<br>
generating electromagnetic radiation from a . device<br>
secured to at least one of a mattress, a pillow and the<br>
frame of a bed; generating a signal from said passive<br>
sensor; receiving said signal by a device secured to at<br>
least one of a mattress, a pillow and the frame of a bed;<br>
and determining the value of the biological parameter<br>
based on said signal.<br>
It is understood that a variety of external power<br>
sources such as electromagnetic coupling can be used<br>
including an ultra-capacitor charged externally through<br>
electromagnetic induction coupling and cells that can be<br>
recharged by an external oscillator. It is also<br>
understood that the sensing system can be remotely driven<br>
by ultrasonic waves.<br>
FIG. 11 is a perspective view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing in closer detail a person 100 wearing<br>
a support structure comprised of patch 72 with a sensor<br>
74, transmitter 71, and digital converter and control 73<br>
positioned on the skin at the end of the tunnel. Person<br>
100 is wearing a necklace which works as antenna 78 and a<br>
pendant in the necklace works as the controller unit and<br>
transmitting unit 79. Solar cells and/or specialized<br>
batteries power unit 79. Patients are used to carrying<br>
Holter monitoring and cards with cords around their necks<br>
and this embodiment can fit well with those currently<br>
used systems. It is understood that, besides a necklace,<br>
a variety of articles including clothing and electric<br>
devices can be used as a receiver/interrogator and this<br>
capability can be easily incorporated into cell phones,<br>
note book computers, hand held computers, internet<br>
appliances for connecting to the internet, and the like,<br>
so a patient could use his/her cell phone or computer<br>
means to monitor his/her brain temperature.<br>
The preferred embodiments shown in FIGS. 10 and 11<br>
can preferably provide continuous monitoring of fever or<br>
temperature spikes for any surgery, for any patient<br>
admitted to a hospital, for nursing home patients, in<br>
ambulances, and to prevent death or harm by hospital<br>
infection. Hospital infection is an infection acquired<br>
during a hospital stay. Hospital infection is the fourth<br>
cause of death in the US and kills more than 100,000<br>
patients annually and occurs primarily due to lack of<br>
early identification of fever or temperature spikes. The<br>
present invention provides timely identification and<br>
therapy of an infection due to 24 hour automated<br>
monitoring of temperature. If there is a spike in<br>
temperature an alarm can be activated. This will allow<br>
timely identification and treatment of an infection and<br>
thus prevent death or costly complications such as septic<br>
shock that can occur due to delay in treating infectious<br>
processes. Besides, said preferred embodiments provide<br>
means for continuous fever monitoring at home including<br>
during sleeping for both children and adults.<br>
FIG. 12A is a front perspective view of a preferred<br>
embodiment showing a person 100 wearing a support<br>
structure comprised of a patch 109 with indicator lines<br>
111 and containing an active sensor 102 positioned on the<br>
skin at the end of the tunnel. The preferred embodiment<br>
shown in FIG. 12 provides transmitting means 104,<br>
processing means 106, AD converter 107 and sensing means<br>
102 connected by flexible circuit 110 to power source<br>
108. For example the transmitting module can include RF,<br>
sound or light. FIG. 12B is a side schematic view showing<br>
the flexible nature of the support structure in FIG. 12A<br>
with flexible circuit 110 connecting microelectronic<br>
package 103 which contains transmitting means, processing<br>
means and sensing means in the right side of the patch<br>
109 to the power source 108 in the left side of said<br>
patch 109. Exemplary embodiments will be described.<br>
In accordance with this exemplary embodiment for<br>
temperature measurement, the thermal energy emitted by<br>
the BTT is sensed by the temperature sensor 102 such as a<br>
miniature thermistor which produces a signal representing<br>
the thermal energy sensed. The signal is then converted<br>
to digital information and processed by processor 106<br>
using standard processing for determining the<br>
temperature. An exemplary sonic-based system for brain<br>
temperature measurement comprises a temperature sensor,<br>
input coupling circuit, signal processing circuit, output<br>
coupling circuit and output display circuit. A<br>
temperature sensor 102 (e.g., thermistor) in a patch 109<br>
placed on the surface of the skin at the medial canthal<br>
area responds to variations in brain temperature which is<br>
manifested as a DC voltage signal.<br>
This signal, coupled to a Signal Processor Circuit<br>
via an Input Coupling Circuit is used to modulate the<br>
output of an oscillator, e.g., a multivibrator circuit,<br>
piezoelectric systems operating in or just above the<br>
audio frequency range. The oscillator is a primary<br>
component of the Signal Processor Circuit. The output of<br>
the oscillator is input to an amplifier, which is the<br>
second primary component of the Signal Processor.<br>
The amplifier increases the output level from the<br>
oscillator so that the output of the Signal Processor is<br>
sufficient to drive an Output Display Circuit. Depending<br>
on the nature of the Output Display Circuit, e.g., an<br>
audio speaker, a visual LED display, or other possible<br>
display embodiment, an Output Coupling Circuit is<br>
utilized to match the signal from the Signal Processor<br>
Circuit to the Output Display Circuit. For an Output<br>
Display Circuit that requires a digital input signal, the<br>
Output Coupling Circuit might include an analog to<br>
digital (A/D) converter circuit. A DC power supply<br>
circuit is the remaining primary component in the Signal<br>
Processor Module. The DC power supply is required to<br>
support the operation of the oscillator and the amplifier<br>
in the Signal Processing Circuit. Embodiments of the DC<br>
power supply can include ultra miniature DC batteries, a<br>
light sensitive DC power source, or some combination of<br>
the two. The micro transducers, signal processing<br>
electronics, transmitters and power source can be<br>
preferably constructed as an Application Specific<br>
Integrated Circuit or as a hybrid circuit alone or in<br>
combination with MEMS  (micro electrical mechanical<br>
systems) technology.<br>
The thermistor voltage is input to a microcontroller<br>
unit, i.e., a single chip microprocessor, which is pre-<br>
programmed to process the thermistor voltage into a<br>
digital signal which corresponds to the patient's<br>
measured temperature in degrees C (or degrees F) at the<br>
BTT site. It is understood that different programming and<br>
schemes can be used. For example, the sensor voltage can<br>
be directly fed into to the microcontroller for<br>
conversion to a temperature value and then displayed on a<br>
screen as a temperature value, e.g., 98.6° F. On the other<br>
hand the voltage can be processed through an analog to<br>
digital converter (ADC) before it is input to the<br>
microcontroller.<br>
The microcontroller output, after additional signal<br>
conditioning, serves as the driver for a piezoelectric<br>
audio frequency (ultrasonic) transmitter. The<br>
piezoelectric transmitter wirelessly sends digital pulses<br>
that can be recognized by software in a clock radio sized<br>
receiver module consisting of a microphone, low-pass<br>
audio filter, amplifier, microcontroller unit, local<br>
temperature display and pre-selected temperature level<br>
alert mechanism. The signal processing software is pre-<br>
programmed into the microcontroller unit of the receiver.<br>
Although the present invention provides means for RF<br>
transmission in the presence of noise, this particular<br>
embodiment using a microphone as the receiving unit may<br>
offer additional advantages in the hospital setting since<br>
there is zero RF interference with the many other RF<br>
devices usually present in said setting. The<br>
microcontroller unit drives a temperature display for<br>
each patient being monitored. Each transmitter is tagged<br>
with its own ID. Thus one receiver module can be used for<br>
various patients. A watch, cell phone, and the like<br>
adapted with a microphone can also work as the receiver<br>
module.<br>
In another embodiment the output of the<br>
microcontroller is used to drive a piezo-electric buzzer.<br>
The microcontroller output drives the piezo-electric<br>
buzzer to alert the user of the health threatening<br>
situation. In this design the output of the<br>
microcontroller may be fed into a digital-to-analog<br>
converter (DAC) that transforms the digital data signal<br>
from the microcontroller to an equivalent analog signal<br>
which is used to drive the buzzer.<br>
In yet another embodiment the output from the (DAC)<br>
is used to drive a speech synthesizer chip programmed to<br>
output an appropriate audio warning to the user, for<br>
instance an athlete at risk of heatstroke. For a sensed<br>
temperature above 3 9 degrees Celsius the message might<br>
be: "Your Body temperature is High. Seek shade. Drink<br>
cold liquid. Rest." For temperature below 3 6 degrees<br>
Celsius the message might be: "Your Body temperature is<br>
Low. Seek shelter from the Cold. Drink warm liquid. Warm<br>
up."<br>
In another embodiment the output is used to drive a<br>
light transmitter programmed to output an appropriate<br>
light signal. The transmitter consists of an infrared<br>
light that is activated when the temperature reaches a<br>
certain level. The light signal will work as a remote<br>
control unit that activates a remote unit that sounds an<br>
alarm. This embodiment for instance can alert the parents<br>
during the night when the child is sleeping and has a<br>
temperature spike.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the platform for local<br>
reporting consists of three electronic modules<br>
mechanically housed in a fabric or plastic holder such as<br>
patch 100, which contain a sensor 102 positioned on the<br>
skin at the BTT site. The modules are: Temperature Sensor<br>
Module, Microcontroller Module, and Output Display Module<br>
in addition to a battery. An electronic interface is used<br>
between each module for the overall device to properly<br>
function. The configuration of this system consists of a<br>
strip such as patch 100 attached to the BTT area by a<br>
self-adhesive pad. A thermistor coupled to a<br>
microcontroller drives an audio frequency piezoelectric<br>
transmitter or LED. The system provides local reporting<br>
of temperature without a receiver. An audio tone or light<br>
will alert the user when certain thresholds are met. The<br>
tone can work as a chime or reproduction of human voice.<br>
Another exemplary embodiment for remote reporting<br>
consists of four electronic modules: Sensor Module,<br>
Microcontroller Module, Output Transmitter Module and<br>
Receiver/Monitor Module. From a mechanical viewpoint the<br>
first three modules are virtually identical to the first<br>
embodiment. Electronically the Temperature Sensor and<br>
Microprocessor Modules are identical to the previous<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment an Output Transmitter<br>
Module replaces the previous local Output Display Module.<br>
Output Transmitter Module is designed to transmit<br>
wirelessly the temperature results determined by the<br>
Microprocessor Module to a remotely located<br>
Receiver/Monitor Module. An electronic interface is used<br>
between each module for proper function. This device can<br>
be utilized by patients in a hospital or home setting. On<br>
a continuous basis temperature levels can be obtained by<br>
accessing data provided by the Receiver/Monitor Module.<br>
A variety of temperature sensing elements can be<br>
used as a temperature sensor including a thermistor,<br>
thermocouple, or RTD (Resistance Temperature Detector),<br>
platinum wire, surface mounted sensors, semiconductors,<br>
thermoelectric systems which measure surface temperature,<br>
optic fiber which fluoresces, bimetallic devices, liquid<br>
expansion devices, and change-of-state devices, heat flux<br>
sensor, crystal thermometry and reversible temperature<br>
indicators including liquid crystal Mylar sheets. Two<br>
preferred temperature sensors are thermistor models ET-<br>
503 and 104JT available from Semitec of Japan.<br>
FIG. 13 shows a block diagram of a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention linking transmitter<br>
120 to receiver 130. Transmitter 120 preferably includes<br>
a chip 112 incorporating a microcontroller (MCU) 114, a<br>
radio frequency transmitter (RF) 116 and a A/D converter<br>
118 in addition to a power source 122, amplifier (A) 124,<br>
sensor 126, and antenna 128, preferably built-in in the<br>
chip. Exemplary chips include: (1) rfPIC12F675F,<br>
(available from Microchip Corporation, Arizona, USA) this<br>
is a MCU + ADC + 433Mhz Transmitter (2) CC1010, available<br>
from Chipcon Corporation of Norway.<br>
Receiver 130 preferably includes a chip RF<br>
transceiver 132 (e.g., CC1000 available from Chipcon<br>
Corporation), a microcontroller unit (MCU) 134, amplifier<br>
and filtering units (A/F) 136, display 138, clock 140,<br>
keypad 142, LED 144, speaker 146, in addition to a power<br>
source 150 and input/output units (I/O) 148 and<br>
associated modem 152, optical transceiver 154 and<br>
communication ports 156.<br>
A variety of means can be used for the transmission<br>
scheme besides the commercially available RF transmitter<br>
chips previously mentioned. One simple transmission means<br>
include an apparatus with a single channel transmitter in<br>
the 916.48 MHz band that sends the temperature readings<br>
to a bed side receiver as a frequency proportional to the<br>
reading. The thermistor's resistance would control the<br>
frequency of an oscillator feeding the RF transmitter<br>
data input. If the duty cycle is less than 1%, the 318<br>
MHz band would be usable. Rather than frequency, a<br>
period measurement technique can be used. The model uses<br>
a simple radio frequency carrier as the information<br>
transport and modulating that carrier with the brain<br>
temperature information derived from a transduction<br>
device capable of changing its electrical characteristics<br>
as a function of temperature (e.g.; thermistor). Either<br>
frequency or amplitude of the carrier would be modulated<br>
by the temperature information so that a receiver tuned<br>
to that frequency could demodulate the changing carrier<br>
and recover the slowly moving temperature data.<br>
Another transmission technique suitable to transmit<br>
the signal from a sensor in a support structure is a<br>
chirp device. This means that when activated, the<br>
transmitter outputs a carrier that starts at a lower<br>
frequency in the ISM band and smoothly increases<br>
frequency with time until a maximum frequency is reached.<br>
The brain temperature information is used to modify the<br>
rate of change of frequency of the chirp. The receiver<br>
is designed to measure the chirp input: very accurately by<br>
looking for two or more specific frequencies. When the<br>
first of the frequencies is detected, a clock measures<br>
the elapsed time until the second frequency is received.<br>
Accordingly, a third, fourth, etc., frequency could be<br>
added to aid in the rejection of noise. Since virtually<br>
all the direct sequence spread spectrum transmitters and<br>
frequency hopping transmitters are spread randomly<br>
throughout their part of the ISM band, the probability of<br>
them actually producing the "right" sequence of<br>
frequencies at exactly the right time is remote.<br>
Once the receiver measured the timing between the<br>
target frequencies, that time is the value that would<br>
represent the brain temperature. If the expected second,<br>
third, or fourth frequency is not received by the<br>
receiver within a "known" time window, the receiver<br>
rejects the initial inputs as noise. This provides a<br>
spread spectrum system by using a wide spectrum for<br>
transmitting the information while encoding the<br>
information in a way that is unlike the expected noise<br>
from other users of the ISM band. The chirp transmitter<br>
is low cost and simple to build and the brain temperature<br>
transducer is one of the active elements that controls<br>
the rate of change of frequency.<br>
Other preferred embodiments for local reporting<br>
include a sensor, an operational amplifier (LM358<br>
available from National Semicondutor Corporation) and a<br>
LED in addition to a power source. It is understood that<br>
the operational amplifier (Op Amp) can be substituted by<br>
a MCU and the LED substituted by a piezoelectric<br>
component.<br>
FIG. 14 is a schematic diagram showing the support<br>
structure 160 with a sensor 158, and MCU 164 controlling<br>
and/or adjusting unit 162. Communication between MCU 164<br>
and unit 162 is achieved by wires 168 or wirelessly 166.<br>
By way of example, but not by limitation, exemplary units<br>
162 include climate control units in cars, thermostats,<br>
vehicle seats, furniture, exercise machines, clothing,<br>
footwear, medical devices, drug pumps, and the like. For<br>
example, MCU 164 is programmed with transmit the<br>
temperature level to receiver unit 162 in the exercise<br>
machine. MCU in the exercising machine unit 162 is<br>
programmed to adjust speed or other settings in<br>
accordance with the signal generated by MCU 164.<br>
The preferred embodiment allows precise positioning<br>
of the sensing apparatus by the support structure on the<br>
BTT site. The support structure is designed to conform to<br>
the anatomical landmarks of the BTT area which assures<br>
proper placement of the sensor at all times. The corner<br>
of the eye is considered a permanent anatomic landmark,<br>
i.e., it is present in the same location in all human<br>
beings. The BTT area is also a permanent anatomic<br>
landmark as demonstrated by the present invention. To<br>
facilitate consistent placement at the BTT site, an<br>
indicator in the support structure can be used as shown<br>
in FIGS. 15A to 15E.<br>
FIG. 15A shows a Guiding Line 170 placed on the<br>
outside surface of the support structure 172. The Guiding<br>
Line 170 is lined up with the medial corner of the eye<br>
174. The sensor 176 is located above the Guiding Line 170<br>
and on the outer edge of the support structure 172, so<br>
once the Guiding Line 17 0 of the support structure 172 is<br>
lined up with the medial corner of the eye 174, the<br>
sensor 176 is positioned on the main entry point of the<br>
tunnel. Thus the support structure 172 can be precisely<br>
and consistently applied in a way to allow the sensor 176<br>
to cover the BTT area at all times.<br>
FIG. 15B shows a different design of the patch 172<br>
but with the same Guiding Line 170 lined up with the<br>
medial corner of the eye 174, thus allowing consistent<br>
placement of sensor 176 at the BTT site despite the<br>
difference in design.<br>
FIG. 15C is another preferred embodiment showing the<br>
senor 176 lined up with medial corner 174. Thus in this<br>
embodiment a Guiding Line is not required and the sensor<br>
176 itself guides the positioning.<br>
In FIG. 15D the MCU 175 and cell 177 of patch 172<br>
are located outside of the BTT site while sensor 176 is<br>
precisely positioned at the BTT site. It is understood<br>
that any type of indicator on the support structure can<br>
be used to allow proper placement in the BTT area<br>
including external marks, leaflets, cuts in the support<br>
structure, different geometry that lines up with the<br>
corner of the eye, and the like.<br>
FIG. 15E is another preferred embodiment showing the<br>
superior edge 176a of sensor 176 lined up with medial<br>
corner 174 and located in the inferior aspect of the<br>
medial canthal area while microchip controller 175 is<br>
located in the superior aspect of the medial canthal<br>
area. Support structure 172 has a geometric indicator 179<br>
comprised of a small recess on the support structure 172.<br>
It is understood that a strip working as support<br>
structure like a band-aid can have the side opposite to<br>
the sensor and hardware made with tear off pieces. The<br>
sensor side is first attached to the skin and any excess<br>
strip can be easily torn off. Two sizes, adult and<br>
children cover all potential users.<br>
The material for the support structure working as a<br>
patch can be soft and have insulating properties such as<br>
are found in polyethylene. Depending on the application a<br>
multilayer structure of the patch can include from the<br>
external side to. the skin side the following: thinsulate<br>
layer; double foam adhesive (polyethylene) ; sensor<br>
(thermistor); and a Mylar sheet. The sensor surface can<br>
be covered by the Mylar sheet, which in turn is<br>
surrounded by the adhesive side of the foam. Any soft<br>
thin material with high thermal resistance and low<br>
thermal conductivity can be preferably used as an<br>
interface between the sensor and the exterior, such as<br>
polyurethane foam (K =0.02 W/m.C). Any support structure<br>
can incorporate the preferred insulation material.<br>
A preferred power source for the patch includes<br>
natural thermoelectrics as disclosed by the present<br>
invention. In addition, standard lightweight thin plastic<br>
batteries using a combination of plastics such as<br>
fluorophenylthiophenes as electrodes can be used, and are<br>
flexible allowing better conformation with the anatomy of<br>
the BTT site. Another exemplary suitable power source<br>
includes a light weight ultra-thin solid state lithium<br>
battery comprised of a semisolid plastic electrolyte<br>
which are about 3 00 microns thick.<br>
The system can have two modes: at room temperature<br>
the system is quiet and at body temperature the system is<br>
activated. The system can also have an on/off switch by<br>
creating a circuit using skin resistance, so only when<br>
the sensor is placed on the skin is the system activated.<br>
The patch can also have a built-in switch in which<br>
peeling off a conductive backing opens the circuit (pads)<br>
and turn the system on. In addition, when removed from<br>
the body, the patch can be placed in a case containing a<br>
magnet. The magnet in the case acts as an off switch and<br>
transmission is terminated when said patch is in the<br>
case.<br>
FIG. 16A to 16C are perspective views of preferred<br>
embodiments showing a person 100 wearing support<br>
structures 180 incorporated as patches. In a preferred<br>
embodiment shown in FIG 16A, the support structure 180<br>
contains LED 184, cell 186, and sensor 182. Sensor 182 is<br>
positioned at a main entry point on the superior aspect<br>
of the medial canthal area adjacent to the medial corner<br>
of the eye 25. LED 184 is activated when signal reaches<br>
certain thresholds and in accordance with the principles<br>
of the invention. FIG. 16B is another preferred<br>
embodiment showing a person 100 wearing support structure<br>
180 with sensor 182 positioned at the general area of the<br>
main entry point of the tunnel with the superior edge 181<br>
of support structure 180 being lined up with the corner<br>
of the eye 25. Support structure 180 contains an<br>
extension that rests on the cheek area 189 and houses<br>
transmitting means 183 for wireless transmission,<br>
processing means 185 and power source 187. FIG 16C is an<br>
exemplary preferred embodiment showing person 100 wearing<br>
a two piece structure 180a comprised of support structure<br>
180b and housing structure 180c connected by wires 192,<br>
preferably a flexible circuit. Support structure 180b<br>
contains the sensor 182 which is positioned at the BTT<br>
site. Housing structure 180c which can comprise an<br>
adhesive strip on the forehead 21 houses processing means<br>
183a, transmitting means 183b and power source 187 for<br>
transmitting the signal to unit 194, for example a cell<br>
phone.<br>
FIG. 17 is a schematic view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing the support structure 180 with sensor<br>
182 being held at the nose 191 by a clip 196. Support<br>
structure 180 extends superiorly to the forehead 193.<br>

FIG. 18 is a perspective view of another preferred<br>
embodiment showing a person 100 wearing a support<br>
structure 180 comprised of a patch with sensor 182<br>
positioned on the skin at the end of the tunnel and<br>
connected by a wire 199 to a decoding and display unit<br>
200. Support structure 180 has a visible indicator 170<br>
lined up with the medial corner of the eye 174. Wire 199<br>
includes an adhesive tape 201 within its first 20 cm, and<br>
most preferably adhesive tape connected to wire 199 is in<br>

FIGS. 19A1 to 19D are schematic views of preferred<br>
geometry and dimensions of support structures 18 0 and<br>
sensing means 182. Special geometry and dimension of<br>
sensors and support structure is necessary for the<br>
optimal functioning of the present invention. The<br>
dimensions and design for the support structure 180 are<br>
made in order to optimize function and in accordance with<br>
the geometry and dimensions of the different parts of the<br>
tunnel.<br>
FIG. 19A1 shows support structure 18 0 working as a<br>
patch. The patch 180 contains sensor 182. The patch 180<br>
may contain other hardware or solely the sensor 182.<br>
Exemplary sensor 182 is a flat thermistor or surface<br>
mount thermistor. The preferred longest dimension for the<br>
patch referred to as nz" is equal or less than 12 mm,<br>
preferably equal or less than B mm, and most preferably<br>
equal or less than 5 mm. The shortest distance from the<br>
outer edge of the sensor 182 to the outer edge of the<br>
patch 180 is referred to as "x" . "x" is equal or less<br>
than 11 mm, preferably equal or less than 6 mm and most<br>
preferably equal or less than 2.5 mm. For illustrative<br>
purposes the sensor 182 has unequal sides, and distance<br>
"y" corresponds to the longest distance from outer edge<br>
of the sensor to outer edge of the patch 180. Despite<br>
having unequal sides, the shortest distance "x" is the<br>
determining factor for the preferred embodiment. It is<br>
understood that the whole surface of the sensor 182 can<br>
be covered with an adhesive and thus there is no distance<br>
between the sensor and an outer edge of a support<br>
structure.<br>
An exemplary embodiment for that includes a sensor<br>
in which the surface touching the skin at the BTT site is<br>
made with Mylar. The Mylar surface, which comprises the<br>
sensor itself, can have an adhesive in the surface that<br>
touches the skin.<br>
As shown in FIG. 19A2, the sensor 182 has adhesive<br>
in its surface, to be secured to skin 11. The sensor then<br>
can be applied to the BTT site in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention. The preferred distance "x"<br>
equal or less than 2.5 mm allows precise pinpoint<br>
placement of sensor 182 at the main entry site of the<br>
tunnel and thus allows the most. optimal signal<br>
acquisition, and it should be used for applications that<br>
require greatest precision of measurements such as during<br>
monitoring surgical procedures. Although a patch was used<br>
as support structure for the description of the preferred<br>
dimensions, it is understood that the same dimensions can<br>
be applied to any support structure in accordance with<br>
the principle of the invention including clips, medial<br>
canthal pads, head mounted gear, and the like.<br>
FIG. 19B is an exemplary embodiment of a round patch<br>
180 with a flat sensor 182. Preferred dimensions "x" and<br>
"z" apply equally as for FIG. 19A1. FIG. 19C is an<br>
exemplary embodiment of a patch 180 with a bead-type<br>
sensor 182. Preferred dimensions "x" and "z" apply<br>
equally as for FIG. 19A1. FIG. 19D is an exemplary<br>
embodiment of a support structure 180 with a sensor-chip<br>
15. Sensor chip 15 comprises a sensor that is integrated<br>
as part of a chip, such as an Application Specific<br>
Integrated Circuit (ASIC). For example sensor chip 15<br>
includes sensor 15a, processor 15b, and transmitter 15c.<br>
Preferred dimension "x" apply equally as for FIG. 19A1.<br>
Other hardware such as power source 2 7 may be housed in<br>
the support structure 180 which can have a long dimension<br>
referred to as "d" that does not affect performance as<br>
long as the dimension "x" is preserved.<br>
The support structure and sensor are adapted to<br>
match the geometry and dimensions of the tunnel, for<br>
either contact measurements or non-contact measurements,<br>
in which the sensor does not touch the skin at the BTT<br>
site.<br>
FIGS. 20A to 20C show the preferred dimensions "x"<br>
for any support structure in accordance with the present<br>
invention. The distance from the outer edge 180a of the<br>
support structure to outer edges of sensor 182a is 11 mm,<br>
as shown in FIG. 20A. Preferably, the distance from the<br>
outer edge 180a of support structure to outer edges of<br>
sensor 182a is 6 mm, as shown in FIG. 20B. Most<br>
preferably, the distance from the outer edge 180a of the<br>
support structure to outer edges of sensor 182a,is 2.5<br>
mm, as shown in FIG. 2 0C.<br>
Preferred positions of sensors 182 in relation to<br>
the medial corner of the eye 184 are shown in FIGs. 21A<br>
and 21B. Support structure 180 positions sensor 182 lined<br>

FIG. 32A is a perspective view of a person 100<br>
wearing a support structure comprised of medial canthal<br>
caps 390 secured on top of a regular nose pad 3 92 of<br>
eyeglasses 394. FIG. 32B is a perspective rear view of<br>
the medial canthal cap 3 90 showing sensor 3 96,<br>
transmitter chip 3 98 and opening 3 97 for securing cap 3 90<br>
to nose pads.<br>
FIG. 33A is a perspective view of a medial canthal<br>
cap 390 being secured to the nose pad 392. Medial canthal<br>
cap 390 contains sensor 396, transmitter chip 398 and<br>
opening 397. FIG. 33B is a perspective view showing the<br>
end result of the medial canthal cap 390 secured to the<br>
nose pad 392.<br>
Special nose pads are provided by the present<br>
invention for proper positioning a sensor at the BTT<br>
site. FIG. 34 is a perspective view of a modified left<br>
side rotatable nose pad 4 00 adapted to position a sensor<br>
on the skin at the end of the tunnel and includes nose<br>
pad 402 with sensor 401, arm 404, house 406 which houses<br>
a gear that allows rotation of a nose pad as a dial for<br>
positioning sensor 401 on different regions of the tunnel<br>
identified as 1 and 2. Position 1 places the sensor in<br>
line with the medial canthal corner and reaches the<br>
general area of the main entry point of the tunnel and<br>
position 2 places the sensor above the medial canthal<br>
corner right at the main entry point of the tunnel. This<br>
embodiment allows automated activation of the sensing<br>
system and takes advantage of the fact that the nose<br>
bridge is cold as seen in FIG. 1 (nose is dark) and FIG.<br>
2 (nose is purple and blue) . When the pad is in its<br>
resting position ("zero"), the sensor 401 rests in a cold<br>
place with temperature of 35.7° C corresponding to the<br>
regular position of nose pads on the nose. In position<br>
"zero" the sensor is in Sleep Mode (temperature of 35.8° C<br>
or less). Changing the sensor to a hot region such as the<br>
general area (position 1) or the main entry point<br>
(position 2) automatically activates the sensor which<br>
goes into Active Mode and start sensing function.<br>
It is understood that numerous special nose pads and<br>
medial canthal pads can be used in accordance with the<br>
principles of the invention including a pivotal hinge<br>
that allows pads to be foldable in total or in part,<br>
self-adjusting pads using a spring, pivoting, sliding in<br>
a groove, and the like as well as self-adjusting<br>
mechanisms which are adaptable to anatomic variations<br>
found in different races. It is understood that the<br>
modified nose pads are preferably positioned high in the<br>
frame, most preferably by connecting to the upper part of<br>
the lens rim or within 6 mm from the upper edge of the<br>
lens rim.<br>
A variety of materials can be used including<br>
materials with super-adherent properties to allow<br>
intimate apposition of sensing means to the BTT site. A<br>
variety of metallic wires exhibiting super-elastic<br>
properties can be used as the hinge assembly mechanism<br>
for allowing proper positioning of sensing means to the<br>
BTT site. Medial canthal pads can be made of a flexible<br>
synthetic resin material such as a silicon rubber,<br>
conductive plastic, conductive elastomeric material,<br>
metal, pliable material, and the like so that appropriate<br>
apposition to the BTT site at the medial canthal area and<br>
proper functioning is achieved. It is also understood<br>
that the medial canthal pads can exhibit elastic and<br>
moldable properties and include material which when<br>
stressed is able to remain in the stressed shape upon<br>
removal of the stress. Any type of rubber, silicone, and<br>
the like with shape memory can also be used in the medial<br>
canthal pads and modified nose pad.<br>
By greatly reducing or eliminating the interfering<br>
constituents and providing a high signal to noise ratio<br>
with a sensor adapted to capture thermal radiation from<br>
the BTT, the present invention provide the means needed<br>
for accurate and precise measurement of biological<br>
parameters including chemical components in vivo using<br>
optical means such as infrared spectroscopy. Moreover,<br>
the apparatus and methods of the present invention by<br>
enhancing the signal allows clinical useful readings to<br>
be obtained with various techniques and using different<br>
types of electromagnetic radiation. Besides near-infrared<br>
spectroscopy, the present invention provides superior<br>
results and higher signal to noise ratio when using other<br>
forms of electromagnetic radiation such as for example<br>
mid-infrared radiation, radio wave impedance,<br>
photoacoustic spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, visible<br>
spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, fluorescent<br>
spectroscopy, scattering spectroscopy and optical<br>
rotation of polarized light as well as other techniques<br>
such as fluorescent (including Maillard reaction, light<br>
induced fluorescence and induction of glucose<br>
fluorescence by ultraviolet light), colorimetric,<br>
refractive index, light reflection, thermal gradient,<br>
Attenuated Total Internal Reflection, molecular<br>
imprinting, and the like. A sensor adapted to capture<br>
thermal energy at the BTE (Brain Thermal Energy) tunnel<br>
site provides optimal means for measurement of biological<br>
parameters using electromagnetic means. The BTE tunnel is<br>
the physical equivalent to the physiologic BTT and is<br>
used herein to characterize the physics of the tunnel.<br>
The geometry and dimension on the skin surface are the<br>
same for the BTT and BTE tunnel.<br>
The following characteristics of the • BTE tunnel<br>
allow optimal signal acquisition. Skin at the end of the<br>
BTE tunnel is thin. With a thick skin radiation may fail<br>
to penetrate and reach the substance to be measured. Skin<br>
at the BTE tunnel is homogenous with constant thickness<br>
along its entire surface. Random thickness of skin as<br>
occurs in other skin areas prevent achieving the<br>
precision needed. The BTE tunnel has no fat. The<br>
intensity of the reflected or transmitted signal can vary<br>
drastically from patient to patient depending on the<br>
individual physical characteristics such as the amount of<br>
fat. A blood vessel in the end of the BTE is superficial,<br>
terminal and void of thermoregulatory shunts. In other<br>
parts of the skin the deep blood vessels are located deep<br>
and vary greatly in position and depth from person to<br>
person. The BTE tunnel has no light scattering elements<br>
covering its end such as bone, cartilage and the like.<br>
Thermal radiation does not have to go through cartilage<br>
or bone to reach the substance to be measured. The end of<br>
the BTE tunnel on the skin has a special but fixed<br>
geometry and is well demarcated by permanent anatomic<br>
landmarks. In other skin surfaces of the body,<br>
inconsistency in the location of the source and detector<br>
can be an important source of error and variability.<br>
Far-infrared radiation spectroscopy measures natural<br>
thermal emissions after said emissions interact and are<br>
absorbed by the substance being measured. The present<br>
invention provides a thermally stable medium,<br>
insignificant number of interfering constituents, and a<br>
thin skin is the only structure to be traversed by the<br>
thermal emissions from the BTE tunnel before reaching the<br>
detector. Thus there is high accuracy and precision when<br>
converting the thermal energy emitted by the BTE tunnel<br>
into concentration of the substance being measured.<br>
The natural spectral emission by BTE tunnel changes<br>
according to the presence and concentration of chemical<br>
substances. The far-infrared thermal radiation emitted<br>
follow Planck's Law and the predicted amount of thermal<br>
radiation can be calculated. Reference intensity is<br>
calculated by measuring thermal energy absorption outside<br>
the substance of interest band. The thermal energy<br>
absorption in the band of substance of interest can be<br>
determined via spectroscopic means by comparing the<br>
measured and predicted values at the. BTE tunnel site. The<br>
signal is then converted to concentration of the<br>
substance measured according to the amount of thermal<br>
energy absorbed.<br>
A sensor adapted to view the BTE tunnel provides<br>
means for measuring a substance of interest using natural<br>
brain far-infrared emissions emitted at the BTE tunnel<br>
site and for applying Beer-Lambert's law in-vivo.<br>
Spectral radiation of infrared energy from the surface of<br>
the BTE tunnel site corresponds to spectral information<br>
of chemical substances. These thermal emissions<br>
irradiated at 38 degrees Celsius can include the 4,000 to<br>
14,000 nm wavelength range. For example, glucose strongly<br>
absorbs light around the 9,4 00 nm band. When far-infrared<br>
thermal radiation is emitted at the BTE tunnel site,<br>
glucose will absorb part of the radiation corresponding<br>
to its band of absorption. Absorption of the thermal<br>
energy by glucose bands is related in a linear fashion to<br>
blood glucose concentration in the thermally sealed and<br>
thermally stable environment present in the BTE tunnel.<br>
The support structure includes at least one<br>
radiation source from infrared to visible light which<br>
interacts with the substance being measured at the BTE<br>
tunnel and a detector for collecting the resulting<br>
radiation.<br>
The present invention provides method for measuring<br>
biological parameters comprising the steps of measuring<br>
infrared thermal radiation at the BTE tunnel site,<br>
producing output electrical signals representative of the<br>
intensity of the radiation, converting the resulting<br>
input, and sending the converted input to a processor.<br>
The processor is adapted to provide the necessary<br>
analysis of the signal to determine the concentration of<br>
the substance measured and for displaying the results.<br>
The present invention includes means for directing<br>
preferably near-infrared energy into the surface of the<br>
skin at - the end of the BTE tunnel, means for analyzing<br>
and converting the reflectance or back scattered spectrun<br>
into the concentration of the substance measured and<br>
support means for positioning the light source and<br>
detector means adjacent to the surface of the skin at the<br>
BTE tunnel site.<br>
The present invention also provides methods for<br>
determining the concentration of a substance with said<br>
methods including the steps of directing electromagnetic<br>
radiation such as near-infrared at the skin at the BTE<br>
tunnel site, detecting the near-infrared energy radiated<br>
from said skin at the BTE tunnel site, taking the<br>
resulting spectra and providing an electrical signal upon<br>
detection, processing the signal and reporting<br>
concentration of the substance of interest according to<br>
said signal. The invention also includes means and<br>
methods for positioning the light sources and detectors<br>
in stable position and with stable pressure and<br>
temperature in relation to the surface to which radiation<br>
is directed to and received from.<br>
The present invention further includes means for<br>
directing infrared energy through the nose using medial<br>
canthal pads, means for positioning radiation source and<br>
detector diametrically opposed to each other, and means<br>
for analyzing and converting the transmitted resulting<br>
spectrum into the concentration of the substance<br>
measured. The present invention also provides methods for<br>
measuring biological parameters with said methods<br>
including the steps of directing electromagnetic<br>
radiation such as near-infrared through the nose using<br>
medial canthal pads, collecting the near-infrared energy<br>
radiated from said nose, taking the resulting spectra and<br>
providing an electrical signal upon detection, processing<br>
the signal and reporting concentration of the substance<br>
measured according to said signal. The invention also<br>
includes means and methods for positioning the radiation<br>
sources and detectors in a stable position and with<br>
stable pressure and temperature in relation to the<br>
surface to which radiation is directed through.<br>
The present invention yet includes means for<br>
collecting natural far-infrared thermal radiation from<br>
the BTE tunnel, means for positioning a radiation<br>
collector to receive said radiation, and means for<br>
converting the collected radiation from the BTE tunnel<br>
into the concentration of the substance measured. The<br>
present invention also provides methods for measuring<br>
biological parameters with said methods including the<br>
steps of using the natural far-infrared thermal emission<br>
from the BTE tunnel as the resulting radiation for<br>
measuring the substance of interest, collecting the<br>
resulting radiation spectra, providing an electrical<br>
signal upon detection, processing the signal and<br>
reporting the concentration of the substance measured<br>
according to said signal.<br>
A drug dispensing system including an infusion pump<br>
can be activated according to the level of the substance<br>
measured at the BTE tunnel, for example insulin can be<br>
injected automatically as needed to normalize glucose<br>
levels as an artificial pancreas.<br>
Any substance present in blood which is capable of<br>
being analyzed by electromagnetic means can be measured<br>
at the BTE tunnel. For example but not by way of<br>
limitation such substances can include exogenous<br>
chemicals such as drugs and alcohol as well as endogenous<br>
chemicals such as glucose, oxygen, lactic acid,<br>
cholesterol, bicarbonate, hormones, glutamate, urea,<br>
fatty acids, triglycerides, proteins, creatinine,<br>
aminoacids and the like. Values such as pH can also be<br>
calculated as pH can be related to light absorption using<br>
reflectance spectroscopy.<br>
In accordance with FIG. 35 a schematic view of one<br>
preferred reflectance measuring apparatus of the present<br>
invention is shown. FIG. 35 shows a light source 420 such<br>
as an infrared LED and a photodetector 422 located side-<br>
by-side and disposed within support structure 426 such as<br>
a medial canthal pad or modified nose pads of eyeglasses<br>
directing radiation 424 at the BTE tunnel 430 with said<br>
light source 420 laying in apposition to the skin 428 at<br>
the BTE tunnel 430. The light source 420 delivers the<br>
radiation 424 to the skin 428 at the BTE tunnel which is<br>
partially absorbed according to the interaction with the<br>
substance 432 being measured resulting in attenuated<br>
radiation 425. Part of the radiation 424 is then absorbed<br>
by the substance 432 and the resulting radiation 425<br>
emitted from BTE tunnel 430 is collected by the<br>
photodetector 422 and converted by a processor into the<br>
blood concentration of the substance 432. Thin skin 428<br>
is the only tissue interposed between radiation 424, 425<br>
and the substance 432 being measured. The concentration<br>
of the substance 432 is accomplished by detecting the<br>
magnitude of light attenuation collected which is caused<br>
by the absorption signature of the substance being<br>
measured.<br>
Infrared LEDs (wavelength-specific LEDs) are the<br>
preferred light source for this embodiment because they<br>
can emit light of known intensity and wavelength, are<br>
very small in size, low-cost, and the light can be<br>
precisely delivered to the site. The light source 420<br>
emits preferably at least one near-infrared wavelength,<br>
but alternatively a plurality of different wavelengths<br>
can be used. The light source emits radiation 424,<br>
preferably between 750 and 3000 nm, including a<br>
wavelength typical of the absorption spectrum for the<br>
substance 432 being measured. The preferred photodetector<br>
includes a semiconductor photodiode with a 400 micron<br>
diameter photosensitive area coupled to an amplifier as<br>
an integrated circuit.<br>
FIG. 36 shows a schematic view of a person 100<br>
wearing a support structure 434 and light source 436 and<br>
detector 438 adapted to measure biological parameters<br>
using spectral transmission means. The light source 436<br>
and photodetector 438 are positioned diametrically<br>
opposed to each other so that the output of the radiation<br>
source 436 goes through the nasal interface 442<br>
containing the substance 44 0 being measured before being<br>
received by the detector 438. Photodetector 438 collects<br>
the resulting transmitted radiation which was directed<br>
through the nasal interface 442. A variety of LEDs and<br>
optical fibers disposed within the support structure 434<br>
such as the medial canthal pads, nose pads and frames of<br>
eyeglasses are preferably used as a light delivery for<br>
the light source 436 and the light detector 438.<br>
Arms of support structures 434 such as medial<br>
canthal pads are moveable and can be adjusted into<br>
different positions for creating fixed or changeable<br>
optical path. Preferred substances measured include<br>
oxygen and glucose. The brain maintains constant blood<br>
flow, whereas flow in extremities change according to<br>
cardiac output and ambient conditions. The oxygen levels<br>
found in the physiologic tunnel reflects central<br>
oxygenation. The oxygen monitoring in a physiologic<br>
tunnel is representative of the general hemodynamic state<br>
of the body. Many critical conditions such as sepsis<br>
(disseminated infection) or heart problems which alter<br>
perfusion in most of the body can be monitored. Oxygen in<br>
the BTE tunnel can continuously monitor perfusion and<br>
detect early hemodynamic changes.<br>
FIG. 37 is a schematic cross-sectional view of<br>
another preferred embodiment of the present invention<br>
using thermal emission from the BTE tunnel. FIG 37 shows<br>
a support structure 450 housing a thermal infrared<br>
detector 444 which has a filter 446 and a sensing element<br>
448 with said sensing element 448 being preferably a<br>
thermopile and responding to thermal infrared radiation<br>
452 naturally emitted by the BTE tunnel 454. The support<br>
structure 450 is adapted to have sensing means 448 with a<br>
field of view that corresponds to the geometry and<br>
dimension of the skin 462 at the end of the BTE tunnel<br>
454. Support structure 450 provides walls 456, 458 which<br>
are in contact with the skin 462 with said walls creating<br>
a cavity 460 which contains thermal radiation 453 which<br>
has already passed through thin skin 462.<br>
For example in the thermally sealed and thermally<br>
stable environment in the BTE tunnel 454, at 3 8° Celsius<br>
spectral radiation 453 emitted as 9,400 nm band is<br>
absorbed by glucose in a linear fashion according to the<br>
amount of the concentration of glucose due to the carbon-<br>
oxygen- carbon bond in the pyrane ring present in the<br>
glucose molecule. The resulting radiation 453 is the<br>
thermal emission 452 minus the absorbed radiation by the<br>
substance 464. The resulting radiation 453 enters the<br>
infrared detector 444 which generates an electrical<br>
signal corresponding to the spectral characteristic and<br>
intensity of said resulting radiation 453. The resulting<br>
radiation 453 is then converted into the concentration of<br>
the substance 464 according to the amount of thermal<br>
energy absorbed in relation to the reference intensity<br>
absorption outside the substance 464 band.<br>
The same principles disclosed in the present<br>
invention can be used for near-infrared transmission<br>
measurements as well as for continuous wave tissue<br>
oximeters, evaluation of hematocrit, blood cells and<br>
other blood components. The substance measured can be<br>
endogenous such as glucose or exogenous such as alcohol<br>
and drugs including photosensitizing drugs.<br>
Numerous support structures can position sensors at<br>
the BTT site for measuring biological parameters.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 38 is a side perspective view of an<br>
alternative embodiment showing a person 100 using head<br>
mounted gear 4 70 as a support structure positioning with<br>
wires 478 and sensor 476 on the skin at the BTT site. A<br>
microelectronic package 472 containing transmitting<br>
means, processing means, and power source is disposed<br>
within or mounted on head band 47 0, with said head band<br>
470 providing wire 478 from microelectronic package 472<br>
for connection with sensing means 476 on the skin at the<br>
BTT site.<br>
It is understood that the sensing means can be<br>
an integral part of the support structure or be connected<br>
to any support structures such as using conventional<br>
fasteners including screw, pins, a clip, a tongue-groove<br>
relationship, interlocking pieces, direct attachment,<br>
adhesives, mechanical joining, and the like; and said<br>
support structures include patches, clips, eyeglasses,<br>
head mounted gear, and the like.<br>
Various means to provide electrical energy to the<br>
sensing system were disclosed. The BTE tunnel offers yet<br>
a new way for natural generation of electrical energy.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 39 is a schematic diagram of a<br>
preferred embodiment for generating thermoelectric energy<br>
from the BTE tunnel to power the sensing system. The<br>
generator of the invention converts heat from the tunnel<br>
into electricity needed to power the system. A<br>
thermoelectric module is integrated into the support<br>
structure to power the sensing system. The thermoelectric<br>
module preferably includes a thermopile or a thermocouple<br>
which comprises dissimilar metallic wires forming a<br>
junction. As heat moves from the tunnel through the<br>
thermoelectric module an electric current is generated.<br>
Since the BTE tunnel is surrounded by cold regions, the<br>
Seebeck effect can provide means for generating power by<br>
inducing electromotive force (emf) in the presence of a<br>
temperature gradient due to distribution of electric<br>
charges at the surface and interface of the<br>
thermoelectric circuit generated by the temperature at<br>
the BTE tunnel.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 3 9 shows the junctions Tl and T2<br>
of metallic wire A 470 and metallic wire B 472 kept at<br>
different temperatures by placing junction Tl at the main<br>
entry point of the tunnel and junction T2 in a cold area<br>
such as the nose bridge (denoted in blue or purple in<br>
FIG. 1B, and referred herein as blue-purple nose).<br>
Metallic wires A 470 and B 472 are made of different<br>
materials and electric current flows from the hot to the<br>
cold region due to the thermal gradient with a magnitude<br>
given by the ratio of the thermoelectric potential. The<br>
potential U is given by U = (Qa - Q b) * ( T1 - T 2) ,. where Qa<br>
and Qb denote the Seebeck coefficient (thermoelectric<br>
power) of metal A and metal B2 and Tx denotes temperature<br>
at the entry point of the BTE tunnel and T 2 denotes<br>
temperature at the blue-purple nose. The thermoelectric<br>
potential generated can power the sensing system and a<br>
capacitor 4 74 inserted into the system can be used to<br>
collect and store the energy and MCU 476 is adapted to<br>
controls the delivery of energy as needed for measuring,<br>
processing and transmitting the signal.<br>
It is understood that other means to convert thermal<br>
energy from the BTE tunnel into electricity can be used.<br>
It is also understood that the surface of the eye and<br>
caruncle in the eye can provide a thermal gradient and<br>
Seebeck effect, however it is much less desirable than<br>
using the skin at the end of the BTE tunnel since<br>
hardware and wires touching the surface of the eye and/or<br>
coming out of the eye can be quite uncomfortable and<br>
cause infection.<br>
Contrary to that numerous support structures<br>
disclosed in the present invention including eyeglasses<br>
can easily be adapted to provide in an unobtrusive manner<br>
the power generating system of the invention, for example<br>
by using a support structure such as eyeglasses for<br>
positioning the hot junction at the BTE site using medial<br>
canthal pads and positioning the cold junction on the<br>
nose using regular nose pads of eyeglasses. It is also<br>
understood that although the power generating system<br>
using Brain Thermal Energy was designed for powering the<br>
sensing system of the present invention, any other<br>
electrical device could be adapted to be supplied with<br>
energy derived from the Brain Thermal Energy tunnel.<br>
Additional embodiments include support structures to<br>
position the sensor at the BTT site of animals. Many<br>
useful applications can be achieved, including enhancing<br>
artificial insemination for mammalian species by<br>
detecting moment of ovulation, monitoring herd health by<br>
continuous monitoring of brain temperature, detection of<br>
parturition and the like.<br>
Accordingly, FIG. 4 0 is a perspective view of a<br>
preferred embodiment showing an animal 101 with sensor<br>
480 positioned at the BTT site with wire 482 connecting<br>
sensor 480 with a microelectronic package 484 containing<br>
transmitting means, processing means, and power source in<br>
the eyelid pocket 486 of animal 101. Signal from<br>
microelectronic package 484 is preferably transmitted as<br>
radio waves 489. The signal from the transmitter in<br>
package 484 can be conveyed to a GPS collar allowing the<br>
identification of the animal having a high temperature<br>
associated with the localization of said animal by GPS<br>
means. Whenever there is an increase in brain temperature<br>
identified by the sensing means 480, the signal of high<br>
temperature activates the GPS collar to provide the<br>
localization of the affected animal. Alternatively the<br>
remote radio station receiving waves 489 activate the GPS<br>
system when the abnormal signal is received. In this<br>
case, the transmitter in package 4 84 only sends the<br>
signal to the remote station, but not to the GPS collar.<br>
FIG. 41A is a perspective view of a portable support<br>
structure 4 90 positioning sensor 4 92 in contact with the<br>
skin 494 at the BTT site for measuring biological<br>
parameters. Support structure 490 incorporated as a<br>
thermometer with a contact sensor 492 is held by a second<br>
person 17 for positioning the sensor 492 on the skin 494<br>
and performing the measurement. FIG. 41B is a<br>
perspective view of a portable support structure 496 with<br>
walls 500 positioning non-contact sensor 4 98 such as a<br>
thermopile with a field of view that matches in total or<br>
in part the geometry and dimension of the skin area at<br>
the end of the BTT. Support structure 4 96 incorporated as<br>
an infrared thermometer is held by a second person 105<br>
for positioning the sensor 498 and measuring biological<br>
parameters. Although it is understood that pointing an<br>
infrared detector to the BTT site can be used in<br>
accordance with the invention, the temperature measured<br>
is not as clinically useful because of the ambient<br>
temperature. Therefore, the support structure 496<br>
contains walls 500 that create a confined environment for<br>
thermal radiation to reach sensor 498 from the skin over<br>
the tunnel. Walls 500 of the support structure are<br>
adapted to match the geometry of the tunnel and to<br>
provide a cavity 499 with the boundaries consisting of<br>
the sensor surface 492 and the skin area 493 viewed by<br>
said sensor 498, in a similar manner as described for<br>
FIG. 37.<br>
It is also understood that many variations are<br>
evident to one of ordinary skill in the art and are<br>
within the scope of the invention. For instance, one can<br>
place a sensor on the skin at the BTT site and<br>
subsequently place an adhesive tape on top of said sensor<br>
to secure the sensor in position at the BTT site. Thus<br>
in this' embodiment the sensor does not need to have an<br>
adhesive surface nor a support structure permanently<br>
connected to said sensor.<br>
It is understood that any electrochemical sensor,<br>
thermoelectric sensor, acoustic sensor, piezoelectric<br>
sensor, optical sensor, and the like can be supported by<br>
the support structure for measuring biological parameters<br>
in accordance with the principles of the invention. It is<br>
understood that sensors using amperometric,<br>
potentiometric, conductometric, gravimetric,<br>
impedimetric, systems, and the like can be used in the<br>
apparatus of the invention for the measurement of<br>
biological parameters. It is also understood that other<br>
forms for biosensing can be used such as changes in ionic<br>
conductance, enthalpy, and mass as well as<br>
immunobiointeractions and the like.<br>
The foregoing description should be considered<br>
as illustrative only of the principles of the invention.<br>
Since numerous modifications and changes will readily<br>
occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to<br>
limit the invention to the exact construction and<br>
operation shown and described, and, accordingly, all<br>
suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted<br>
to, falling within the scope of the invention.<br>
