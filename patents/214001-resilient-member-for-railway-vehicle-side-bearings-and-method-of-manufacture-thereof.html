				<td>RESILIENT MEMBER FOR RAILWAY VEHICLE SIDE BEARINGS<br>
AND METHOD OF MANUFACTURE THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a resilient member for use in side bearings, in particular, for<br>
side bearings deployed on railroad cars, typically freight cars. The invention also relates to a<br>
method of manufacturing the resilient members and the mold used in such manufacture.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Side bearings used on railroad vehicles, in particular railroad freight trucks, have<br>
taken many different configurations. Typically, such side bearings are used to control truck<br>
dynamic motion to minimize dynamic instabilities at higher operating speeds. More<br>
specifically, as railroad trucks become lighter and travel at higher speeds, dynamic instability<br>
lendencies increase, and it becomes necessary that such truck side bearings control such<br>
increased tendencies. These dynamic instabilities typically are referred to in the railroad<br>
industry as "truck hunting."<br>
More specifically, a railroad truck"s hunting motion starts at the wheel/rail interface<br>
and is translated into the multi-body system of the railroad car. Thus, in order to minimize<br>
such hunting motion being translated into the multi-body system, side bearings are employed<br>
as one of a multitude of suspension components, and serve multiple functions.<br>
When mounted on a freight truck"s suspension, side bearings provide damping as a<br>
result of friction between the side bearing and car body. Further, the radial stiffness of most<br>
side bearings provides a more controlled connection between the wheels and the multi-body<br>
system.<br>
Tn order to provide the above functions, side bearings rely on resilient members which<br>
make up part of the side bearing assembly. Such resilient members come in many shapes and<br>
forms, and each has its advantages and disadvantages.<br>
One method of manufacture of such resilient members is through a transfer molding-<br>
type operation. More specifically, in such an operation, typically a resilient or elastomeric<br>
material (used interchangeably herein), such as rubber compound, is introduced into a mold<br>
through sprues located in a cap for the mold. The rubber compound is introduced under<br>
pressurized conditions to fill the mold which also contains metal elements covered with<br>
adhesive such that the rubber compound bonds to the metal. The compound is allowed to<br>
cure, and the resultant resilient member is then removed from the mold.<br>
Tn conducting this operation, it is usually the case that the resilient member is weaker<br>
at the locations adjacent to where the sprues are located due to the inhomogeneity of the<br>
rubber compound in the area of the incoming flow. If such weakened regions occur at<br>
portions of the resilient member which receive the greatest stresses, forces and/or strains,<br>
such as on outer surface areas, the resilient member will often fail and break prematurely.<br>
This is especially true under extensive dynamic loading, such as in a suspension system.<br>
Similarly, when the cap is removed from the mold, as a result of rubber compound remaining<br>
in the sprue, weakened areas are created in the resilient material as the rubber compound<br>
sometimes break", off beyond the end of the sprue and into the working body of the resilient<br>
member, making the resilient member non-usable or susceptible to stress concentrations and<br>
premature failure.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, the problems of the prior art are avoided, and<br>
a resilient member is provided having a unique geometry which is substantially less<br>
susceptible to failure than the resilient members currently in use. Further, a method and mold<br>
are provided which maintain the simplicity of prior methods and mold assemblies<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a resilient member,<br>
typically for use as an insert in a railway vehicle side bearing assembly. Although one skilled<br>
in the art will realize many oilier applications of the resilient member of the present invention.<br>
The resilient member includes a first rigid element extending in a linear direction, and having<br>
a first end and a second end. A second rigid element is disposed spaced substantially parallel<br>
to the first rigid element to provide a space between the first rigid element and the second<br>
rigid element. The second rigid element extends in the linear direction of the first rigid<br>
element, and includes a first end, with at least the first end displaced or offset along the linear<br>
direction away from the first end of the first rigid element. Resilient or elastomeric material<br>
fills the space between the first rigid element and the second element and adheres to the two<br>
elements. The resilient material extends between the first end of the first rigid element and<br>
the first end of the second element to define a predetermined, preferably substantially<br>
concave, profile between the two first ends. The resilient material also includes at a<br>
predetermined location at least one weakened region along the profile thereof. The weakened<br>
region a result of the resilient material being assembled with the first rigid element and the<br>
second rigid element, and adjacent to sprue locations in a mold. The weakened region is at a<br>
predetermined location on the resilient material which is subject to the lowest stress/strains<br>
when the resilient member is used as an insert in a side bearing assembly.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to a method of making a resilient member<br>
which is used as an insert in a side bearing assembly. The method includes placing a first and<br>
a second rigid element in a mold wilh the first and second rigid elements extending in a linear<br>
direction and spaced, typically substantially parallel, from each other. As a result, a space is<br>
defined between the two elements. As noted previously, the first and second rigid elements<br>
each have a first end and a second end, with the first end of the first rigid element offset from<br>
the first end of the second rigid element. The first and second rigid elements have side<br>
surfaces substantially parallel to each other and facing each other. An adhesive is applied on<br>
the side surfaces of the first and second rigid elements which face each other, and resilient<br>
material is then forced into the mold through a cap having a predetermined, preferably<br>
substantially concave, profile surface extending between the first ends of the two rigid<br>
elements. The cap includes sprues spaced from each other around the periphery of the cap,<br>
and adjacent to the firs! end of the second rigid member. The resilient material is forced<br>
through the sprues into the mold. The sprues are positioned at a predetermined location of<br>
the lowest stress/strain in the resilient material of the dynamically loaded resilient member,<br>
and in ihe closes! proximity (o the second rigid element which allows the resilient material to<br>
be forced into the mold without stripping the adhesive off the side surface of the second rigid<br>
element. The resilient material is then cured in the mold to rigidify and have it adhere to the<br>
first and second rigid elements to result in the resilient member.<br>
In another aspect, the invention relates to the mold for forming the resilient member.<br>
The mold includes a cap having sprues spaced about the periphery of the cap which allows<br>
the mold body to be filled with resilient elastomeric material forced through the sprues<br>
under pressure. The sprues are positioned at a predetermined location of the lowest<br>
stress/strain in the resilient material of the dynamically loaded resilient member, and in the<br>
closest proximity to a rigid element in the mold while not stripping adhesive from the wall of<br>
the rigid element. The rigid elements in the mold may be, for example, flat or cylindrical<br>
elements previously placed in the mold for the purpose of manufacturing the resilient member<br>
or mount of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a freight car truck 11 of the type upon which the resilient member<br>
described herein is deployed. A typical freight car truck 11 includes wheels 13 connected by<br>
axles 15 supported by side frames 17 which are connected to each other through a bolster 19.<br>
The bolster 19 includes side bearing pads 21 upon which side bearings can be mounted.<br>
Side bearings are generally necessary on the freight car trucks for railroad cars<br>
because they control hunting in railroad cars which result from lighter weights and higher<br>
speeds for modern day railroad cars. Figures 2-4 illustrate generally how freight car side<br>
bearings serve multiple functions. Specifically, in a multi-body system, a freight car is<br>
subject to a number of different forces due to, for example, the track 25 on which the railroad<br>
car travels having a generally rolling configuration as illustrated in Figure 2. Similarly, body<br>
roll occurs due to track configuration such as shown in Figure 4. The freight car side bearings<br>
serve multiple functions. More specifically, friction between the side bearings which are<br>
mounted on the bolster 19, and the car body 23 provides damping. Radial stiffness of the side<br>
bearings provides a more controlled connection between the bolster 19 and the car body 23.<br>
Further, the resilient member of the present invention provides long travel that more evenly<br>
distributes vertical and friction forces in curving, particularly during a broader range of<br>
vertical displacements. This is more clearly shown in Figure 4.<br>
Figure 5 further illustrates how hunting motion starts at the wheel/rail interface and is<br>
translated into the multi-body system. For instance, Figure 5a illustrates this tendency for<br>
connected wheels 13 rolling on a track having separate rails 27, for example, where the axle<br>
15 is turned at an angle from the typical perpendicular position relative to the rails. Figure 5b<br>
illustrates the geometry of rail rollover in such a circumstance, with the angular displacement<br>
l|/ of the one axle 15 relative to the track direction more clearly shown in Figure 5c. This is a<br>
problem that is common on all railroad trucks and is readily apparent from Figure 5 to those<br>
of ordinarily skill in the art.<br>
Referring to Figures 6-8, one embodiment of a resilient member 29 for use in the side<br>
bearing. The resilient member 29 includes an outer rigid element or first sleeve 31, which is<br>
generally cylindrical in shape, radially spaced apart from an inner rigid element or second<br>
sleeve 4 1 (Fig. 8), which is generally concentric with the first sleeve. Resilient or elastic<br>
material 39 fills the space 40 (Fig. 8) between the spaced apart sleeves 31 and 41. At the ends<br>
of the resilient member 29, the resilient material 39 extends in a generally or substantially<br>
concave profile 33 and 45, as shown in Figure 8, that serves to connect the ends of the first<br>
sleeve 31 to the respective ends of the second sleeve 41. The resilient member 29 is<br>
manufactured using a transfer process, as described hereafter, by transferring the resilient<br>
material 39 through sprues in a cap of a mold. The locations on the resilient material 39<br>
corresponding to the locations of the sprues of the cap are generally shown as sprue risers or<br>
semi-spherical regions 37. The sprue risers 37 result in a weakened region of the resilient<br>
material 39 relative to the working body of the resilient material, due to the local effects of<br>
the incoming flow of resilient material. Further, because the sprue risers 37 create a<br>
substantial change in the contour of the profile 33, the sprue risers induce stress/strain<br>
concentrations. Therefore to avoid negatively affecting the flex life and performance of the<br>
resilient member 29, it is desirable to place the sprue risers 37 at a predetermined location of<br>
relatively low stress/strain along the profile 33. In this embodiment, the lowest stress/strain<br>
area of profile 33 is adjacent to outer sleeve 31. This lowest stress/strain area also coincides<br>
with a bulge area created by the displacement of the first sleeve 31 relative to the second<br>
sleeve 41 under static and dynamic loading. The "bulge area" is the area on the profile 33<br>
that expands outwardly from the resilient material 39 as a result of shear or compression<br>
forces on the resilient material. Because the lowest stress/strain area of profile 33 is also<br>
adjacent to the inner wall of sleeve 31, the position of the sprue risers 37, and correspondingly<br>
the sprues for the mold, are selected to be as close to the inner wall of the sleeve 31 as<br>
possible. This location is selected such that when the resilient or elastomeric material is<br>
transferred under pressure through the sprues, adhesive, which has previously been placed on<br>
the inside walls of the sleeve 31, is not stripped off by the incoming flow of the resilient<br>
material from the sprue. Thus, the most preferable position for the sprues, corresponding to<br>
the position of the sprue risers 37, is the lowest stress/strain area along the profile 33, and also<br>
the closest position to the inner wall of the sleeve 31 which allows transfer of the elastomeric<br>
material without stripping the adhesive off the inner walls.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 8, the ends of the inner rigid cylindrical shaped element or<br>
second sleeve 41 are linearly offset relative to the corresponding ends of the outer rigid<br>
cylindrical element or sleeve 31 to define a linear deformation space 47. For example, a static<br>
or dynamic load applied to either the inner or out sleeve 31 or 41 causes a translation of the<br>
inner sleeve relative to the outer sleeve. The linear deformation space 47 defines the<br>
maximum relative linear displacement between the sleeves 31 and 41 if the resilient member<br>
29 is supporting a structure that bridges the diameter of the outer sleeve. As one skilled in the<br>
art will realize, linear translation along the concentric axis of the inner and outer sleeve 31<br>
and 41 may be greater than the linear deformation space 47 if the structure mating with the<br>
inner and outer sleeves does not limit their relative movement. Also, as one skilled in the art<br>
will realize, the static and dynamic loads applied to he resilient member 29 may cause<br>
compression and/or shear forces within resilient material 39, and such loads are not limited to<br>
pure linear loads.<br>
Profiles 45 and 33 have been described as being substantially concave, but preferably<br>
include a combination of arcuate or radial sections and straight sections. For example,<br>
referring to Figure 8, profile 33 includes first and second sections 33" and 33" separated by a<br>
third section 33"". First section 33" extends along a radial path, r1; from the end of inner<br>
sleeve 41 to the third section 33"", which is a straight section defined by the angle a. The<br>
second section 33" extends from the third section 33"" along a radial path, r2, to connect with<br>
the end of outer sleeve 31. The sprue risers 37 may be primarily located within the second<br>
section 33", but may extend into the third section 33"". In this embodiment, r1 is preferably<br>
about equal to r2. One skilled in the art will realize, however, that the values of r1 and r2 will<br>
depend on the given application environment. Further, profile 45 includes a first section 45"<br>
that extends from the end of outer sleeve 31 to the middle of space 40 as a straight line at a<br>
predetermined angle p. A second section 45" joins the first section 45" and follows a radial<br>
path, r3, to connect with inner sleeve 41. In this embodiment, the value of r3 is about equal to<br>
that of r1 and r2. The lengths and values of r1, r2 and r3 and the values of a and ß are chosen<br>
so that the highest stress/strain areas within the resilient material 39, resulting from loading<br>
the resilient member 29, occur toward the center of the resilient material and away from the<br>
bond interlace between the resilient material and the sleeves 31 and 41. Thus, profiles 33 and<br>
45 may include radial or arcuate sections, straight sections, or combinations of both to reduce<br>
the stress and strain concentrations along the profile in the area where the sprue risers 37 are<br>
located.<br>
Referring to Figure 15, the sprue risers 37 have a predetermined geometry, generally<br>
including a semi-spherical projection extending from profile 33 of the resilient material 39<br>
and integral with the working body of the resilient material. The sprue riser 37 has a<br>
spherical body 37", having a radius rs, and a cylindrical member 37" projecting from the<br>
spherical body. The cylindrical member 37" generally extends in the same linear direction of<br>
the sleeves 31 and 41. However, the orientation of the cylindrical member 37" is a function<br>
of the sprues in the mold, as will be discussed below. The predetermined geometry of the<br>
sprue riser 37 is chosen such that the body 37" is of a size to contain a substantial amount of<br>
the weakened or inhomogeneous area of the resilient material 39 caused by the flow<br>
discontinuities adjacent to the sprue. Further, the predetermined geometry of the sprue riser<br>
37 is preferably a rounded or spherical contour so as to reduce stress/stain concentrations.<br>
Additionally, the predetermined geometry of the sprue riser 37 is preferably limited in overall<br>
size so as not to interfere with mating structures during deflection of the resilient member 29,<br>
which would result in induced stress/strain concentrations and premature failure.<br>
With respect to how the resilient member is deployed in a side bearing, Figure 9<br>
illustrates a typical prior art side bearing 51. Conventional resilient members 55 are shown<br>
deployed in the conventional side bearing 51. Resilient member 29 may be used to replace a<br>
conventional side bearing 51 in a retrofit application, thereby providing improved suspension<br>
characteristics by minimizing dynamic instabilities. For example, Figure 10 illustrates a cage<br>
53 in which the resilient member 29 can be received to be deployed in a manner as shown for<br>
the conventional resilient members 55 in Figure 9. As may be appreciated from Figure 6, the<br>
resilient member 29 is placed in the cage 53 in a upside-down position compared to that<br>
shown in Figure 6. The load direction on the resilient member 29 is shown by an arrow as<br>
shown in Figure 6. When a load is placed on the resilient member 29 bulge occurs, as will be<br>
readily apparent to those skilled in the art of resilient members. In this embodiment, one of<br>
the bulge areas is also in or around the proximity of the region containing the lowest relative<br>
stresses and strains at the outer profile 33 of the resilient material 39.<br>
Figure 11 illustrates in side cross-sectional view a mold 101 having a cavity 63 used<br>
to manufacture the resilient member 29 of the invention. As may be appreciated, the two<br>
concentric sleeves 31 and 41 (not shown) are placed within the mold cavity. The inner sleeve<br>
4 1 is supported within the mold 101 and is held concentrically around central projection 65.<br>
The outer sleeve 31 is received in contact with the outer walls of the cavity 63, defined by the<br>
mold base 66. Pressurized elastomeric material 67 is passed through sprues in a cap 61 for<br>
the mold 101 to be received within cavity 63 of the mold.<br>
Figure 12 further illustrates the cap 61 as having sprues 69 and vents 71. The sprues<br>
69 are located as far outward from the center of the cap 61 as possible, where the resilient<br>
material 39 experiences the lowest stresses in the loading of the resilient member 29, and to<br>
be close to the inner wall of the outer sleeve 31 (not shown) without stripping off the<br>
adhesive coating, as discussed above. More specifically, in manufacturing the resilient<br>
member 29, adhesive is first placed on the inside wall surfaces of sleeve 31 and on the outside<br>
wall surfaces of sleeve 41. Because of the desire to locate the sprue risers 37 at the point of<br>
lowest stress and strain, which in this embodiment are positioned to be adjacent to the outer<br>
sleeve 31, it is required that the sprues 69 be located as close as possible to the inner wall of<br>
the sleeve 31, but not so close as to remove or strip off the adhesive when elastomeric<br>
material 61 is forced under pressure into the mold 101.<br>
As may be appreciated from Figure 12, the cap 61 includes sprues 69 which taper<br>
downwardly to be narrower at the bottom than at the top. Figure 13 illustrates a section 73 of<br>
the sprue, corresponding to the cylindrical member 37" of the sprue riser 37, which is<br>
substantially of the same diameter throughout and narrower than the main portion of the sprue<br>
69. Section 73 opens into an enlarged dome region 75. The purpose of the narrow section 73<br>
and dome region 75 is to allow the sprue risers or semi-spherical regions 37 to form and to<br>
create a separation plane within narrow section 73 when the cap 61 is removed, thereby<br>
breaking off the resilient material in the resilient member from material still remaining in the<br>
sprue 69. Limiting the material separation plane to section 73 insures that no breakage occurs<br>
in the working body portion of the resilient material 39 of the resilient member 29. Further,<br>
by localizing the separation plane within section 73, any rough surfaces at the separation<br>
plane that may cause stress and strain concentrations are kept as far away as possible from the<br>
working body of the resilient material 39. Vents 71 are placed at a location close to the top of<br>
the inside portion of the cap 61, which defines the profile 33 of the member 29, so as to allow<br>
material to move upward within the cap portion of the mold, and above the location of the<br>
sprue openings.<br>
In manufacturing the resilient member 29 of the invention, the sleeves 31 and 41 are<br>
placed within the mold, adhesive is coated on to the exposed outer surface of sleeve 41 and<br>
the exposed inner surface of sleeve 31. The sleeves 31 and 41 are then preheated for a period<br>
of about 20 minutes at a temperature of about 325 degrees Fahrenheit. As one skilled in the<br>
art will realize, however, the time period and temperature may vary depending on the type of<br>
resilient material, the type of adhesive, and the size and thickness of the resilient member.<br>
Typically the adhesive employed is of the type commercially available from Lord Corporation<br>
under the designation of Lord 810 Adhesive. Of course, the adhesive selection will be readily<br>
apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, and other equivalent adhesives can be used in<br>
place of the noted composition.<br>
After preheating the mold and the sleeves 31 and 41, an elastomeric material 67 is<br>
forced through the sprues to fill the mold" Typically, such an elastomeric material is a rubber<br>
compound, for example, such as that commercially available from Lord Corporation under<br>
the designation Lord A-135SH. Although one skilled in the art will realize that other elastic<br>
materials may be utilized, such as natural rubber, synthetic elastomers and blends thereof.<br>
The sleeves can be metal, typically carbon steel. Other appropriate metals may be used as<br>
will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates a different type of mount or bearing 79 which can be<br>
manufactured in accordance with the invention. In this case two plates 81 and 83, for<br>
example, rectangular in shape, include a flat pad of resilient or elastomeric material 85<br>
connecting the offset ends of the two plates. The mount 75 when deployed on a railroad car<br>
is positioned to have the plates extend horizontally so that the load on the mount is in the<br>
direction of arrow B, which is substantially perpendicular to the plane of the plates.<br>
Although, as one skilled in the art will realize, the mount may be utilized in other applications<br>
where the load is applied to one or both plates in a direction A, substantially parallel to the<br>
plane of the plates.<br>
As with the prior embodiment, the mount 79 is made through a transfer process. In<br>
this case, the plates 81 and 83 preferably would be arranged vertically in a mold. A cap for<br>
the mold has an inner surface profile matching the profile 87 of the resilient material 85 and<br>
the sprues for the cap, corresponding to sprue risers 89, are located at the lowest stressed and<br>
strained area of the profile under a dynamic and/or static load. In all other aspects the<br>
materials and methods of manufacture are the same as for the prior embodiment, and the<br>
weakened regions of the resilient material, corresponding to the sprue risers 89, are positioned<br>
at the predetermined location of lowest stress/strain in the resilient material profile 87.<br>
Having thus described the invention, the same will become better understood from the<br>
appended claims in which it is set forth in a non-limiting manner.<br>
