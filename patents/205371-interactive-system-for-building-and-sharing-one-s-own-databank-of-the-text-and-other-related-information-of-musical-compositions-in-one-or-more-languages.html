THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY	DESCRIBES	AND<br>
ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TOBEPERFOMED.<br><br><br><br>
TITLE<br>
INTERACTIVE SYSTEM FOR BUILDING AND SHARING ONE'S OWN DATABANK OF THE TEXT AND OTHER RELATED INFORMATION OF MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS IN ONE OR MORE LANGUAGES.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an interactive system for building (including, saving, appending, retrieving, modifying) and sharing one's own databank of the text and other related information of musical compositions including but not limited to songs, hymns, ghazals, in one or more languages in a well-classified manner, it being accepted that musical compositions including songs, hymns, ghazals are part of people's daily social lives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that musical compositions have been part of people's daily social lives from time immemorial and it is a common habit for most people to hum and sing the same to themselves and to others.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that musical compositions are popular with one and all, and therefore there are several types of businesses involved in the production of the same.<br>
Since musical compositions are a popular and an integral part of society, there are several Music clubs and Television/Radio programs based on<br>
2<br><br>
them. It is a well-accepted fact that musical compositions are an important ingredient of films and theatre. Also, there are several karaoke bars where songs are sung with the text of the same being displayed.<br>
It is well known that traditionally, it is only the actual musical compositions that are stored on Recording media like cassettes and CDs, while their text as such is not readily or always available along with the same.<br>
It is well known that the text of musical compositions, when available in the printed form as Songbooks, etc. are not classified comprehensively. Furthermore, such data is not published regularly and people have to wait for new editions to be published to be able to access updated data. Where such data is available over the Internet, the classification of data is not comprehensive or necessarily user-friendly and may not always allow users to conveniently locate or find data for their use. It is well known that during the grooming years of a child, nursery rhymes are used as a tool to enhance a child's learning abilities, create strong phonic building blocks and sharpen listening skills. It is a well-accepted fact that nursery rhymes have been identified as an excellent way to develop this awareness. It would be useful for parents and teachers to be able to store and display such nursery rhymes by well-defined classifications, to enhance and enrich the learning experience. It is a well-accepted fact that, with the advent of cellular phones, the tunes of musical compositions have become very popular in the form of ring tones. It would be useful for users of cellular phones to store<br>
3<br><br>
additional information relating to the ring tone, like the Category of the Song, Title of the Song, Singer(s)/Band, etc., as well as to compose and edit ring tones.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that jingles featured in advertisements of products and services are quite popular and used as effective marketing tools. It is also a well-known fact that people identify particular products and services by their corresponding jingles. It would be useful for enthusiasts to store additional information relating to the jingles, like the product or service advertised, Title of jingle, Singer(s)/Artiste(s) etc. It is a well-known fact that musical compositions are often recorded by singers, songwriters and lyricists in their own voice. It would be useful for such singers, songwriters and lyricists if there were to exist a system which would allows them to Add, Retrieve, Modify, Delete, Print, Export, Import, Schedule the text and other related information of their own musical compositions, record the musical composition with or without accompaniment of musical instruments, and to be able to review the same for enhanced appreciation.<br>
It is a well-accepted fact that many people learn and impart vocal skills on a professional or amateur basis. It would be helpful for such people to learn and impart the same by well-defined classifications, if there were to exist a system which would allow them to Add, Retrieve, Modify the text and other related information of musical compositions, by well-defined classifications, thereby helping them to remember the text and other related information of the same.<br>
4<br><br>
It is a well known fact that in some countries like India, there exists a popular form of family entertainment by the name "Antakshari", where the participants are challenged, amongst other ways, by being asked to sing songs beginning with a particular letter or syllable or word, and it would be very helpful for people taking part or wishing to take part in such events/activities were to exist a system which would allow a user to Add, Retrieve, Modify, Delete, Print, Export, Import, Schedule the data comprising of the text and other related information of musical compositions, by well-defined classifications, thereby helping them to remember the text and other related information of the same.<br>
It is a well accepted fact that people generally cannot remember a large amount of data, whether by classifications or not, without external help, and it would be very helpful if there were to exist a system that would help people to Add, Retrieve, Modify, Delete, Print, Export, Import, Schedule the data comprising of the text and other related information of musical compositions, thereby helping people to better remember the same for use in daily life.<br>
