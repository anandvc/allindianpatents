Herbicidal composition<br>
The present invention relates to new selectively herbicidal compositions for controlling grasses and weeds in crops of useful plants, especially in crops of cereals, maize and sorghum, which compositions comprise a herbicide and a safener (counter-agent, antidote) and protect the useful plants, but not the weeds, against the phytotoxic action of the herbicide, and also to the use of the compositions for controlling weeds in crops of useful plants.<br>
When using herbicides, the cultivated plants may also suffer considerable damage, depending on, for example, the amount of herbicide and the method of application, the species of cultivated plant, the nature of the soil and climatic conditions, for example hours of daylight, temperature and amounts of rainfall. In order to deal with that and similar problems, various substances have already been proposed as safeners. which are capable of antagonising the harmful effect of the herbicide on the cultivated plant, that is to say are capable of protecting the cultivated plant, without appreciably impairing the herbicidal action on the weeds to be controlled. It has been found that the proposed safeners often act very specifically both with respect to the cultivated plants and with respect to the herbicide, and in some cases also in dependence on the method of application, that is to say, a particular safener is often suitable only for a particular cultivated plant and a specific class of herbicidal substance or a particular herbicide. For example, WO 96/21652 and WO 99/47525 disclose compounds that protect the cultivated plants from the phytotoxic action of herbicides such as, for example, 3-hydroxy-4-aryl-5-oxopyra2oline derivatives.<br>
It has now been found that compounds of formula lla<br><br><br>
are suitable for protecting cultivated plants from the phytotoxic action of a particular class of specific, substituted 3-hydroxy-4-aryl-5-oxopyrazoline herbicides.<br>
Accordingly, a selectively herblcidal composition is proposed according to the invention which, in addition to customary inert formulation assistants, for example carriers, solvents and wetting agents, comprises as active ingredient a mixture of<br><br>
a) a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide of formula I<br><br><br>

The invention relates also to a method for the selective control of weeds in crops of useful plants, which method comprises treating the useful plants, their seeds or seedlings or the crop area thereof with, simultaneously or separately,<br>
a)	a herbicidally effective amount of a herbicide of formula I,<br>
b)	an amount, which is effective for antagonism of the herbicide, of a safener of formula II and, optionally,<br><br>
c) an aoditive comprising an oil of vegetable origin or an alkylated derivative thereof, or a mineral oil or a mixture thereof.<br>
Cultivated plants that may be protected against the harmful effect of the above-mentioned herbicides by means of the safeners of formula II are especially cereals, maize and sorghum.<br>
Crops are to be understood as including those that have been made tolerant to herbicides or classes of herbicides by means of conventional breeding or genetic engineering methods, for example IMI Maize, Poast Protected Maize (Sethoxydim tolerance), Liberty Link Maize, B.tAiberty Link Maize, IMI/Liberty Link Maize, IMI/Liberty Link /B.t. Maize, Roundup Ready Maize and Roundup Ready/B.L Maize.<br>
The weeds to be controlled may be both monocots and dicots, for example Stellaria, Nasturtium, Agrostis, Digitaria, Avena, Setaria, Sinapis, Lolium, Solanum, Echinochloa, Scirpus, Monochoria, Sagittaria, Bromus, Alopecurus, Sorghum halepense, Rottboellia, Cyperus, Abutilon, Sida, Xanthium, Amaranthus, Chenopodium, Ipomoea, Chrysanthemum, Galium, Viola and Veronica.<br>
Crop areas are areas of land on which the cultivated plants are already growing or in which the seeds of those cultivated plants have been sown, and also areas of land on which it is intended to grow those cultivated plants.<br>
A safener of formula II may, depending on the intended purpose, be used to pre-treat the seed material of the cultivated plant (dressing the seed or the seedlings) or may be incorporated into the soil before or after sowing. It may, however, also be applied, alone or together with the herbicide and, optionally, the oil additive, after the emergence of the plants. The treatment of the plants or seed with the safener can therefore, in principle, be effected independently of the time at which the heriDi'cide is applied. The treatment of the plant can, however, also be carried out by applying the herbicide and the safener simultaneously (for example in the form of a tank mixture). The rate of application of the safener In relation to the herbicide depends largely on the method of application. In the case of field treatment, which is effected either using a tank mixture with a combination of the safener and the herbicide or by the separate application of the safener and the herbicide, the ratio of herbicide to safener is generally from 1:100 to 100:1, preferably from 1:10 to 10:1, and especially from 1:5 to 5:1.<br><br>
In the case of field treatment, from 0.001 to 5.0 kg safener/ha, preferably from 0.001 to 0.5 kg safener/ha. are generally applied.<br>
The rate of application of herbicide is generally from 0.001 to 2 kg/ha, but preferably from 0.005 to 0.5 kg/ha.<br>
In addition to the conventional formulation adjuvants, oil additives c) may be introduced as additives into the spray tank (as a tank mixture), besides surfactants and salts. In the composition according to the invention, the amounts of oil additive employed are generally from 0.01 to 2 % based on the spray mixture. The oil additive can, for example, be added to the spray tank in the desired concentration after the spray mixture has been prepared. Suitable oil additives include emulsifiable oil concentrates of mineral oils or, especially, of vegetable oils.<br>
Preferred vegetable oil concentrates comprise, for example, the following 4 components (A) from 20 to 90 % by weight of alkyl esters of higher fatty acids (C4-C22), (B) from 4 to 40 % by weight of anionic or non-ionic surfactants, (C) from 2 to 20 % by weight of higher fatty acids (C10-C20), and (D) up to 140 % by weight, based on the total amount of components (A) to (C), of hydrocarbons.<br>
Especially preferred oil additives c) comprise alkyl esters of higher fatty acids (C8-C22), especially the Ci-C4alkyl ester derivatives of C12-C18 fatty acids, for example the methyl esters of lauric acid, palmitic acid and oleic acid. Those esters are known as methyl laurate (CAS-111-82-0), methyl palmitate (CAS-112-39-0) and methyl oleate (CAS-112-62-9). The application and action of the oil additives can be improved by combining them with surface-active substances, for example anionic surfactants (B), Examples of suitable anionic surfactants are listed in WO 97/34485 on pages 7 and 8.<br>
Preferred surface-active substances are anionic surfactants of the dodecylbenzylsulfonate type, especially the calcium salts thereof. The concentration of the surface-active substances based on the total additive is generally from 1 to 30 % by weight.<br>
Preferred higher fatty acids (C) have from 12 to 18 carbon atoms.<br>
The addition of an organic solvent (D) to the oil additive/surfactant/fatty acid mixture can,<br>
furthemiore, bring about a further increase in action. Suitable solvents (D) are, for example,<br><br>
aromatic solvents, e.g. Solvesso® (ESSO) or Aromatic Solvent® (Exxon Corporation) types. The concentration of those solvents can be from 10 to 80 %, by weight, of the total weight.<br>
Such oil additives are described, for example, in US-A-4 834 908. They are especially preferred for the composition according to the invention. An especially preferred oil additive is known under the name MERGE®.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are suitable for all methods of application that are customary in agriculture, for example pre-emergence application, post-emergence application and seed dressing. In the case of seed dressing, from 0.001 to 10 g of safener/kg of seed, preferably from 0,05 to 2 g of safener/kg of seed, are generally applied. When the safener is applied in liquid form shortly before sowing, with swelling of the seed, safener solutions are advantageously used that comprise the active ingredient in a concentration of from 1 to 10 000 ppm, preferably from 100 to 1000 ppm.<br>
For application, the safeners of formula II or combinations of those safeners with the herbicides of formula I and, optionally the oil additives are advantageously processed, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology, into formulations, for example into emulsifiable concentrates, coatable pastes, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules or microcapsules. Such formulations are described, for example, in WO 97/34485, on pages 9 to 13. The formulations are prepared in known manner, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with liquid or solid formulation adjuvants, for example solvents or solid carriers. Furthermore, surface-active compounds (surfactants) may also be used in preparation of the formulations. Solvents and solid carriers that are suitable for that purpose are mentioned, for example, in WO 97/34485 on page 6.<br>
Suitable surface-active compounds are, depending on the nature of the active ingredient of formula I being formulated, non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants and mixtures of surfactants having good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. Examples of suitable anionic, non-ionic and cationic surfactants are listed, for example, in WO 97/34485 on pages 7 and 8.<br><br>
Furthermore, the surfactants customarily employed in formulation technology, which are described, inter alia, in "Mc Cutcheon's Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual" MC Publishing Corp., Ridgewood New Jersey, 1981, Stache, H., "Tensid-Taschenbuch", Carl Hanser Verlag, MunichA/ienna, 1981 and M. and J. Ash, "Encyclopedia of Surfactants", Vol l-lll, Chemical Publishing Co., New York, 1980-81, are also suitable for preparation of the herbicidal compositions according to the invention.<br>
The herbicidal formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of active ingredient mixture comprising a compound of formula I together with a compound of formula II, from 0.01 to 2 % by weight of oil additive, from 1 to 99.9 % by weight of a solid or liquid formulation adjuvant and from 0 to 25 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a surfactant. Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br>
The compositions may also comprise further ingredients such as stabilisers, for example vegetable oils or epoxidised vegetable oils (epoxidised coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soybean oil), antifoams, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and tackifiers, as well as fertilisers or other active ingredients. There are various suitable methods and techniques for using the safeners of formula II or compositions comprising them for protecting cultivated plants against the harmful effects of herbicides of formula I; the following are examples: i) Seed dressing<br>
a)	Dressing the seeds with a wettable powder formulation of a compound of fomiula II by shaking in a vessel until the fonnulation is uniformly distributed over the seed surface (dry dressing). Approximately from 1 to 500 g of compound of formula II (from 4 g to 2 kg of wettable powder) are used per 100 kg of seed.<br>
b)	Dressing the seeds with an emulsifiable concentrate of a compound of formula II according to method a) (wet dressing).<br>
c)	Dressing by immersing the seed in a liquid formulation comprising from 100 to 1000 ppm of a compound of formula II for from 1 to 72 hours and, if desired, subsequently drying the seeds (immersion dressing).<br>
Dressing the seed or treating the gemiinated seedlings are naturally the preferred methods of application because the treatment with the active ingredient is directed wholly at the<br><br>
target crop. Generally from 1 to 1000 g of antidote, preferably from 5 to 250 g of antidote,<br>
are used per 100 kg of seed, although, depending on the method employed, which also<br>
allows the addition of other active ingredients or micronutrients, amounts that exceed or fall<br>
short of the specified concentration limits may be employed (repeat dressing).<br>
ii) Application in the form of a tank mixture<br>
A liquid formulation of a mixture of antidote and herbicide (ratio of the one to the other from<br>
10:1 to 1:100) is used, the rate of application of herbicide being from 0.005 to 5.0 kg per<br>
hectare. Such a tank mixture is applied before or after sowing.<br>
iii) Application in the seed furrow<br>
The compound of formula II is introduced into the open, sown seed furrow in the form of an<br>
emulsifiable concentrate, a wettable powder or granules and, after the seed furrow has<br>
been covered, the herbicide is applied pre-emergence in the normal manner.<br>
iv) Controlled release of the active ingredient<br>
The compound of formula II is applied in solution to granulated mineral carriers or<br>
polymerised granules (urea-formaldehyde) and dried. If desired, a coating may be applied<br>
(coated granules) which enables the active ingredient to be released in metered amounts<br>
over a predetemiined period of time.<br>
Preferred formulations have especially the following composition (% = percent by weight;<br>
'active ingredient mixture' denotes the mixture of the compound of formula I with the<br>
compound of formula II)<br>

It is often more practical to formulate the active Ingredient of formula I and the mixing partner of formula II separately and then, shortly before application, to bring them together in the applicator in the desired mixing ratio in the form of a "tank mixture" in water. The ability of the safeners of formula II to protect cultivated plants from the phytotoxic action of herbicides of formula I is illustrated in the following Examples.<br><br>
Biological Examples<br>
Examples B1, B2 and B3: Post-emergence applications of mixtures of a herbicide of formula I, wherein Ri and R3 are -C2H5; R4 and R5 together form a group Z2 -CRi4{Ri5)-CRi6(Ri7)-0-CRi8(Ri9)-CR2o(R2i)- (Z2), wherein R,4. R15, Rie, R17, R18, R19, R2oand R21 are hydrogen; and G Is either hydrogen (= herbicide no. I,) or (CH3)3CC(0)- (= herbicide no. I2), with a safener of formula lla, wherein R22 is ethyl (= safener no. Ilai), or of formula lib, wherein R23 is ethyl (= safener no. Ilbi), to wheat and barley, together with 3 different weeds.<br>
The test plants are grown in pots under greenhouse conditions until a post-application stage, A standard soil is used as the cultivation substrate. At a post-emergence stage, the herbicides, both alone and in admixture with safeners, are applied to the test plants or to cultivated plants of which the seeds were dressed with safeners. Application is carried out using an emulsion prepared from a 25 % emulsifiable concentrate (Example F1, b)) of the test substances using 500 I of water/ha. The rates of application are matched to the optimum dosages determined under field or greenhouse conditions. Evaluation of the tests is carried out after 9, 10, 20 and 24 days (100 % action = complete destruction; 0 % action = no phytotoxic action). The results obtained show that the safener used can significantly reduce the damage caused to the cultivated plants by the herbicide of formula I.<br>
Examples of the action of the composition according to the invention are given in Tables B1,B2andB3.<br><br>
