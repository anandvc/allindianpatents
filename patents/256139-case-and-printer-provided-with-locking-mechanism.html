CASE AND PRINTER PROVIDED WITH LOCKING MECHANISM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a locking mechanism that prevents items in a case from easy removal, as well as to a locking mechanism of a printer for issuing receipts, tickets, valuable papers, etc. used in POS (point-of-sales) terminals, electronic cash registers, etc.<br>
in the related art, valuable papers include prescribed characters or identification marks such as bar codes printed on particular sheets. Such valuable papers, such as railway tickets, admission tickets, and other securities are not necessarily produced in advance. Accordingly, a printing apparatus (printer) or the like may print the characters just before a customer receives a service and is given the valuable papers.<br>
United States Patent No. 6,118,469 discloses a printer which prints prescribed items on receipt paper to produce a sales slip or a receipt to be given to the customer when a customer made a purchase or received a service, while recording accounting information such as a selling price on journal paper to produce a duplicate copy.<br>
However, the foregoing related art printing apparatus for printing valuable papers or other securities has a problem. For example, valuable papers or other securities may be forged such that a third party can acquire paper (printing medium), such as unprinted receipt paper or journal paper, from the printing apparatus in an unauthorized manner, and then print on the acquired paper with another printing apparatus.   As a result, there is a need for<br><br>
the printing apparatus itself to prevent robbery or the like of such paper (printing medium).<br>
Japanese Patent Publication No. 5-325018A discloses a commodity sales registering apparatus such as a POS terminal, an electronic cash register, or the like that is intended to prevent such unauthorized conduct. This commodity sales registering apparatus is equipped with a cover device that covers receipt paper and journal paper from above.<br>
In the cover device, a journal cover for covering journal paper from above and a receipt cover for covering receipt paper from above are attached to a case body in an openable manner, and a locking mechanism for locking the journal cover in a closed state is provided. The locking mechanism is locked and unlocked with a key.<br>
-However, because the locking mechanism of the above-described related art commodity sales registering apparatus employs the mechanical locking method using a key or the like, it requires one cover device and one key for each apparatus.<br>
A further problem with this related art apparatus is that a third person can easily recognize from the appearance of the apparatus that locking is done by the key. A third party may acquire receipt paper or journal paper from a POS terminal or a commodity sales registering apparatus in an unauthorized manner by obtaining a key, or by unlocking the locking mechanism using an unauthorized (e.g., illegal) copied key. Thus, there is a need for a safer locking mechanism capable of preventing such unauthorized conduct.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a case with a locking mechanism that prevents items in the case from being easily removed, as well as a printer with a locking mechanism that prevents a printing rriedium accommodated in the printer from being easily removed from the outside.<br>
In order to achieve the above object, according to the invention, there is provided a case, comprising:<br>
a housing, having an opening communicated with a storage space<br>
formed in the housing;	~   -<br>
a cover, attached to the housing so as to be movable between a first position at which the cover closes the opening and a second position at which the cover opens the opening; and<br>
a locking mechanism, disposed in the storage space and adapted to lock the cover at the first position,<br>
wherein the locking mechanism is adapted to cancel the locking of the cover upon receipt of an electric signal.<br>
With this configuration, the accommodated item is confined in the housing unit by the locking mechanism, and unlocking is effected by an electric signal. Therefore, an authorized person can unlock the cover with a locking mechanism without the need for touching the case, that is, via an electric signal.<br>
Accordingly, the locking mechanism can be controlled remotely. This<br>
remote control makes it possible to prevent a third party from unauthorized<br>
removal of the item in the case.	.   .<br>
Preferably, the housing is engaged with the cover, and the locking<br><br>
mechanism comprises:<br>
a locking member, which retains an engaged state of the housing and the cover; and<br>
an actuator, which actuates the locking member so as to cancel the retention of the engaged state in response to the electric signai.<br>
With this configuration, the locking member can be controlled remotely by inputting the electric signal externally. In addition, even if the actuator is out of order, the closed state of the cover and the housing can be maintained.<br>
Preferably, the locking mechanism cannot be directly contacted from outside the housing when the cover is placed in the first position.<br>
With this configuration, an unauthorized conduct of canceling the engagement by destroying the locking mechanism from outside the case can be prevented once the cover is placed in the first position. This makes it possible to prevent a third person from taking out the accommodated thing easily from the case.<br>
According to the invention, there is also provided a case, comprising:<br>
a case is provided that comprises a housing comprising a first space adapted to accommodate a printer provided with a lid covering a second space adapted to accommodate a printing medium;<br>
a cover attached to the housing and movable between a first position at which the cover prevents the lid from being moved to open the second space, and a second position at which the cover permits the lid to be moved so as to open the second space; and<br>
a locking mechanism, disposed in the first space and~adapted to lock the cover at the first position,<br><br>
wherein the locking mechanism cancels the locking of the cover in response to an electric signal.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to prevent a conduct of bringing out the printer without authorization by opening the cover or taking out the printing medium by opening the lid.<br>
Preferably, the housing is engaged with the cover, and the locking mechanism comprises:<br>
a locking member, which retains an engaged state of the housing and the cover; and<br>
an actuator, which actuates the locking member so as to cancel the retention of the engaged state in response to the electric signal.<br>
Preferably, the locking mechanism cannot be directly contacted from outside the housing when the printer is accommodated in the storage space.<br>
Preferably, the printer comprises a first member that moves the lid so as to open the second space, and a second member that ejects the printing medium from the printer. The cover covers the first member and the second member when the cover is placed in the first position.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to prevent at least the following unauthorized (e.g., illegal) conduct: bringing out the printer by opening the cover, taking out the printing medium by opening the lid with the actuation of the first member, or taking out the printing medium by ejecting it with the actuation of the second member.<br>
According to the invention, there is also a printer, comprising:<br>
a body having a first space adapted to store a printing medium;<br>
a lid attached to the body so as to cover the first space;<br><br>
a housing having a second space in which the body is disposed;<br>
a cover attached to the housing and movable between a first position at which the cover prevents the lid being moved to open the first space and a second position at which the cover permits the iid to be moved to open the first space; and<br>
a locking mechanism disposed in the second space and adapted to lock the cover at the first position,<br>
wherein the locking mechanism cancels the locking of the cover in response to an electric signal.<br>
Preferably, the housing is engaged with the cover, and the locking mechanism comprises:<br>
a locking member, which retains an engaged state of the housing and the cover; and<br>
an actuator, which actuates the locking member to cancel the retention of the engaged state in response to the electric signal.<br>
Preferably, the locking mechanism cannot be directly contacted from outside the housing when the body is in the storage space.<br>
Preferably, the printer further comprises: a first member, operable to move the lid to open the first space; and a second member, operable to eject the printing medium from the body. The cover is placed in the first position so as to cover the first member and the second member.<br>

The printer further comprises a transmitter adapted to receive an external signal for opening the drawer member, and operable to transmit the electric signal to the locking mechanism in response to the<br><br>
external signal, and to the drawer member to open the drawer member.<br>
With this measure, an external apparatus such as a host computer transmits the external signal and the printer main body receives the external signal, and causes the transmitter to transmit the electric signal for opening the drawer member. The locking mechanism can thereby be unlocked. That is, it is not necessary to prepare an electric signal system that is dedicated to unlocking of the locking mechanism.<br>
Preferably, the printing medium is adapted to have a financial value when the printer prints on the printing medium.<br>
With this configuration, it is possible to prevent unauthorized removal of the printing medium subjected to printing operation to be valuable papers.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the invention will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, a case 10 according to a first embodiment comprises a housing unit 30 having an opening 37 and capable of accommodating items, a cover 20 that is attached in an openable manner so as to at least partially cover the opening 37, and a locking mechanism 60 for locking the cover 20 and the housing unit 30 with each other in a closed state. When locked after closing of the cover 20, the locking mechanism 60 restrains accommodated items inside the housing unit 30. The locking mechanism 60 is unlocked by an electric signal.<br>
As shown in Figs. 2A to 2C, the housing unit 30 comprises a bottom panel 31, a back panel 41, and a side panel 51. The locking mechanism 60 comprises a locking member 61 and an electromagnetic actuator 71 operated by an electric signal. The locking member 61 is attached to the side panel 51 and the electromagnetic actuator 71 is attached to the bottom panel 31.   The<br><br>
details of the locking mechanism 60 are described further below.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2C, the side panel 51 includes a central, front panel 51 and panels 53a and 53b having respective cover attachment portions 56a and 56b are connected to the front panel 52 from both sides. The housing unit 30 generally assumes a substantially rectangular parallelepiped shape and has the top opening 37. The housing unit 30 is formed by attaching the side panel 51 to the bottom panel 31 after bending the side panel 51 along lines, and attaching the back panel 41 to the bottom panel 31 and the panels 53a and 53b.<br>
As shown in Figs. 3A to 3D, the bottom panel 31 is a tray-shaped member obtained by bending sideline portions. The bottom panel 31 has; at the two front corners and positions somewhat deviated to the rear side from the centers of the longer sidelines in the plan view of Fig. 3A, four fixing portions 32a, 32b, 32c, and 32d to which items to be accommodated can be fixed. The bottom panel 31 also has, at the two rear corners, fixing portions 33a and 33b to which the rear panel 41 is to be fixed. The fixing portions 32a, 32b, 32c, 32d, 33a, and 33b extend inward from the bent sideline portions and thereby assume bracket shapes.<br>
Holes 32e, 32f, 32g, and 32h for screwing the items to be accommodated are formed through the top flat portions of the four fixing portions 32a, 32b, 32c, and 32d so as to be symmetrical with respect to the center when viewed from the direction of Fig. 3C (i.e., from the left side). Likewise, holes 33c and 33d for screwing of the back panel 41 are formed through the top flat portions of the two fixing portions 33a and 33b, to which the back panel 41 is fixed. As shown in the side views of Figs. 3B-3D, large holes 32i, 32j: 32k, 32), 32e, and 33f in which to insert a screwing tool such as a screwdriver are formed<br><br>
through the bottom plate right under the six respective holes 32e, 32f, 32g, 32h, 33e, and 33f.<br>
Four tapped holes 34a; 34b, 34c; and 34d for fixing the side pane! 51, four tapped holes 35a, 35b, 35c, and 35d for fixing the electromagnetic actuator 71, one bearing hole 38 and four holes 36a, 36b, 36c, and 36d for fixing an assembled case 10 with a locking mechanism to a location, are formed through the bottom plate at corresponding positions.<br>
As shown in Figs. 4A to 4C, the back panel 41 an L-shaped member having a top curved portion 42. The back panel 41 is formed with support portions 43a and 43b for supporting rotary shafts of the cover 20 and hooks 44a and 44b such that they are bent to project in the same direction.<br>
Shaft holes 43c and 43d for support of the rotary shafts are formed through tip portions of the two support portions 43a and 43b, respectively. Holes 44c and 44d for fixing of the side panel 51 are formed through the two hooks 44a and 44b, respectively. The bottom plate 48, which constitutes part of the L shape in the side view, is formed with escapes 46a and 46b and fixing holes 45a and 45b, so that the back panel 41 can be fixed to the side panel 41 so as to avoid the fixing portions 33a and 33b of the bottom panel 31.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5A to 5D, the side panel 51 in which the two panels 53a and 53b are connected to the front panel 52 assumes a bracket shape in a Dian view. In the side panel 51, four fixing portions 54a, 54b, 54c, and 54d for ixing to the bottom panel 31 are bent inward.<br>
The two panels 53a and 53b are formed with respective attachment jortions 56a and 56b for attachment of the cover 20. The attachment portions i6a and 56b recede inward by a length that is the same as the plate thickness in<br><br>
regions of overlap with the cover 20. Shaft holes 58a and 58b are formed through the attachment portions 56a and 56b, and arc-shaped long holes 58c and 58d are formed through the attachment portions 56a and 56b at positions located on circles having the shaft holes 58a and 58b as the centers. Two fixing holes 59a and 59b for fixing of the back panel 41 are formed through the respective panels 53a and 53b at positions close to their rear ends.<br>
Four fixing holes 55a, 55b, 55c, and 55d for fixing of the locking member 61 are formed through the panel 53a. A rib 57 projects inward so that the locking member 61 attached is not seen from the side of the front panel 52.<br>
As shown in Figs. 6A to 6D, two cover support portions 21a and 21b (side plates) of the cover 20, which are penetrated by fixing holes, are bent to the same direction so that the cover 20 conforms to the shape of the side panel 51. The cover 20 is formed, at a position close to the front end, with one hook 22 having a rectangular hole 22a. The hook 22 is engagable with the locking member 61 of the housing unit 30, to render the cover 20 in a closed state.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6A, shaft holes 24a and 24b are formed through the two respective cover support portions 21a and 21b. Further, the cover support portions 21a and 21b are formed with inward projections 25a and 25b at positions on circles that correspond to the long holes 58c and 58d that are formed through the cover attachment portions 56a and 56b of the side panel 51 (see Figs. 5C and 5D). Hooks 26a and 26b extend from the peripheries of the cover support portions 21a and 21 b, and are bent inward in a stair-like manner.<br>
The projections 25a and 25b can fit in the respective long holes 58a and 58b to restrict the opening/closing angle of the cover 20. The two hooks 26a and 26b allow springs to be stretched between themselves and the hooks<br><br>
44a and 44b of the back panel 41, to urge the cover 20 in the opening direction.<br>
Further, two projections 27a and 27b extend from the peripheries cf the cover support portions 21a and 21b. The projections are bent inward, and peripheral portions of a top plate 28 of the cover 20 are folded. The cover support portions 21a and 21b and the top plate 28 are fixed to each other.<br>
The side plate of the cover 20, provided with the hook 22, is formed with a wide portion 23 that recedes inward by a length that is substantially the same as the plate thickness, so that the cover 20 is closed parallel with the outer surface of the panel 53a of the side panel 51, and the hook 22 is guided to the locking member 61 reliably.<br>
The material of the housing unit 30 and the cover 20 is a steel sheet of about 1 mm in thickness that has been subjected to rust prevention treatment. Alternatively, such a sheet material as a stainless steei sheet (or equivalent thereof) may be used, as long as it has sufficient workability and strength. To increase handling performance, the outer ridges of the cover 20 and the housing unit 30 are formed by bending a sheet material and processed the sheet material, so as to eliminate sharp edges and provide sufficient strength.<br>
The design of the case 10 with a locking mechanism is not limited to those disclosed for this embodiment. Further, the case 10 may be designed in accordance with the sizes and shapes of items to be accommodated as well as their portions to be put in a closed state by the cover 20.<br>
Next, an assembling method of the case 10 with a locking mechanism will be described.<br>
First, the electromagnetic actuator 71'(described further below in greater detail) is screwed to the bottom panel 31 from above at positions.<br><br>
Then, the fixing portions 54a, 54b, 54c, and 54d of the side panel 51 are inserted through the cuts of the longer sideline portions of the bottom panel 31, and screwed to the bottom panei 31 from inside using the tapped holes 34a. 34b, 34c, and 34d. Then, the bottom plate 48, which constitutes part of the L shape in a side view, of the back panel 41 is screwed to the fixing portions 33a and 33b of the bottom panel 31, by inserting screws into the holes 33e and 33f which are formed through the bottom plate of the bottom panel 31.<br>
The back panel 41 is fixed to the side panel 51 by inserting shafts 81 (see Fig. 7A) into the holes 44c and 44d of the hooks 44a and 44b and the fixing holes 59a and 59b of the side panel 51, and putting E-shaped stop rings into grooves 81a inside the housing unit 30 being assembled.<br>
Then, the locking member 61 (described further below in greater detail) is attached to the inner surface of the panel 53a at a position. The housing unit 30 is thus completed.<br>
Then, the cover 20 shown in Fig. 6 is attached to the housing unit 30. To perform the attaching, the cover 20 is attached such that the cover support portions 21a and 21b cover the cover attachment portions 56a and 56b of the side panel 51, and the top plate 28 covers the curved portion 42 of the back panel 41.<br>
As for a fixing method, the cover 20 is fixed by inserting the shafts 81 into the left-hand shaft holes 24a, 58a, and 43c and the right-hand shaft holes 24b, 58b, and 43d, which are formed through the cover support portions 21a and 21b, the cover attachment portions 56a and 56b, and the support portions 43a and 43b of the back panel 41, and putting E-shaped stop rings into the grooves 81a inside the housing unit 30.    Springs are stretched between the<br><br>
hooks 26a and 26b of the, cover support portions 21a and 21b and the hooks 44a and 44b of the back panel 41. The case 10 with the locking mechanism 60 is thus completed.<br>
With the above-described assembling method of the case 10 with a locking mechanism, to disassemble the assembled case 10, the cover 20 is   . opened and the screws are disengaged through the opening 37.<br>
To remove the cover 20. it is also necessary to remove the E-shaped stop rings and pull out the shafts 81 from inside the housing unit 30, and to disengage the back panel 41 and the side panel 51 from each other by likewise removing the E-shaped stop rings and pulling out the shafts 81.<br>
Therefore, it is difficult to disassemble the case 10 with a locking mechanism from outside in a state that items are accommodated to fill the opening 37 of the housing unit 30 of the case 10, and are fixed and the cover 20 is closed and locked.<br>
Similarly, the locking mechanism 60 is provided in the housing unit 30 in such a state that it is impossible to directly contact the locking mechanism 60 from outside the case 10. As a result the case 10 cannot be unlocked from outside.<br>
The cover 20 is urged in the opening direction by the springs stretched between the hooks 26a and 26b of the cover support portions 21a and 21b and the hooks 44a and 44b of the back panel 41. Therefore, if the locking mechanism 60 is unlocked, the cover 20 is opened in the range that is permitted Dy the long holes 58c and 58d of the cover attachment portions 56a and 56b, and the cover 20 is thereafter stopped. The cover 20 does not open as long as t is closed and locked.   Therefore, cne can recognize when the cover 20 is<br><br>
locked.<br>
Next, the locking mechanism 60 will be described in detail with reference to Figs. 8A to 8C. [0062]<br>
As shown in Fig. 8A, the locking member 61 is attached to the inner surface of the panel 53a of the side panel 51. The locking member 61 comprises a rotary hook 62 to engage with the hook 22 of the cover 20, a lever 63 for stopping rotation of the rotary hook 62 at an angle and thereby maintaining a locked state with the hook 22, and a stopper 64 fixed to the inner surface of the panel 53a. The rotary hook 62 and the lever 63 are pivotally supported by the inner surface of the panel 53a via shafts 66a and 66b, respectively.<br>
The rotary hook 62 is formed with a claw 62b to be inserted into the hole 22b of the hook 22, a hook 62c on which a spring 65a for urging the rotary hook 62 in the unlocking direction is hooked, and a projection 62d for stopping the rotation of the rotary hook 62 by butting against the stopper 64 when the rotary hook 62 is rotated in the unlocking direction.<br>
One end of the lever 63 is formed with a hook 63b on which a spring 65b for urging the lever 63 in the closing rotation direction about the shaft 66b is hooked. The other end of the lever 63 is formed with a cut 63a for receiving a stopper 62a of the rotary hook 62. The end that is formed with the hook 63b is also formed with a presser 63c that is bent inward.<br>
As shown in Fig. 8B, the electromagnetic actuator 71 comprises a solenoid (electromagnetic switch) 72 for advancing or retreating a plunger 73 to a closing or opening position in response to an electric signal, an L-shaped press lever 76 pivotally supported by a shaft 77 .(see Fig. 7B) and with one end fitted with a tip portion of the plunger 73, and a plate 75 to which the above<br><br>
components are attached.<br>
The shaft 77 is driven in and fixed to the plate 75. The press lever 76 is fitted with the tip portion of the shaft 77, and an E-shaped stop ring is put in a groove 77a. The press lever 76 is pivotally supported by the shaft 77. The plate 75 is provided with a pin 74 to which one end of the spring 65b is fixed. The plate 75 is also formed with a stopper 75a by bending part of the plate 75 to prevent excessive rotation of the press lever 76 when it is rotated in the closing direction.<br>
The operation of the above locking mechanism 60 will be described in greater detail beiow.<br>
When the cover 20 is lowered to close the housing unit 30, the hook 22 formed in the tip portion of the cover 20 pushes the top portion of the claw 62b of the rotary hook 62. The claw 62b is finally engaged with the hole 22a of the hook 22.<br>
At this time, the rotary hook 62 is forced to rotate in the opening direction because it is urged by the spring 65a. However, since the lever 63 is urged in the closing direction by the spring 65b, the cut 63a of the lever 63 receives the stopper 62a of the rotary hook 62, whereby the locking member 61 is locked in a closed state.<br>
When the locking member 61 has been locked, the presser 63c which is formed in the end portion of the lever 63 is stopped in a state that it pushes the press lever 76 of the electromagnetic actuator 71, and the tip portion of the plunger 73 is thereby pulled out. At the same time, the spring 65b urges the presser 63c so as to maintain this state.<br>
To unlock the locking member 61, the solenoid 71 is operated by an<br><br>
electric signal so as to return the pulled-out plunger 73. [0069] As the plunger 73 is returned, the press lever 76 pushes the presser 63c of the lever 63. As a result, the lever 63 is disengaged from the stopper 52a of the rotary hook 62, and the rotary hook 62 is rotated in the opening direction as urged by the spring 65a. The claw 62b is disengaged from the hole 22a of the hook 22 of the cover 20, and the cover 20 is unlocked.<br>
When the cover 20 has been unlocked, the rotary hook 62 is rotated in the opening direction because it is urged by the spring 65a, and the projection 62d butts against the stopper 64 and is thereby stopped. At this time, the cut 63a of the lever 63 is stopped in such a state that it is not engaged with the" stopper 62a of the rotary hook 62. A standby state is maintained until the cover 20 is closed again.<br>
The locking mechanism 60 is not limited to the one used in this embodiment as long as the solenoid 72 is used. For example but not by way of limitation, the locking member 61 in which unlocking is effected by directly transmitting, to the rotary hook 62, operation of the plunger 73 that is caused by the solenoid 72. Further, the means for urging the cover 20, the rotary hook 62, and the lever 63 may be cylinders or the like in which air or oil is sealed.<br>
A printer that is equipped with the above case with a locking mechanism will be described. [0073]<br>
As shown in Fig. 9A, a printer main body 110 is equipped with an ejection mouth 112 through which a printed part of rolled sheet (printing medium) 116 is ejected, a printer cover 111 as a lid for covering the incorporated rolled sheet 116 without covering the ejection mouth 112, an open button 113 as a lid manipulation member for opening the printer cover 111 being dosed, a platen 125 that is<br><br>
attached to the printer cover 111 and serves as a feed member for ejecting a part of the rolled sheet 116, a mctor (not shown) for driving (rotating) the piaten 125, a feed button 114 for activating the platen 125, and indication lamps 115 for indicating a state of the printer main body 110.<br>
As shown in Fig. SB, a printing mechanism 120 of the, printer main body 110 is equipped with a rciied sheet support frame 122 that serves to incorporate the rolled sheet 116 in a main body frame 123 and a roiled sheet cover 121 that is provided inside the printer cover 111, and covers the rolled sheet 116 from above. Further, a thermal print head 124 that is urged by a spring 130 is disposed at such a position as to be opposed to the platen 125 and an auto-cutter unit 126 is disposed below the ejection mouth 112.<br>
The operation of the printing mechanism 120 is as follows. Printing is performed as the platen 125 presses a part of the thermal recording rolled sheet 116 against the print head 124. At the same time, the platen 125 feeds a part of the rolled sheet 116 in an ejecting direction D. After completion of a printing operation, a part of the rolled sheet 116 is cut by being positioned between a movable blade 128 that is driven by a motor 127 of the auto-cutter unit 126 and a fixed blade 129 provided on the side of the printer cover 111.<br>
The use of the printer main body 110 having the above printing mechanism 120 makes it possible to print securities such as valuable paper, a railway ticket, or an admission ticket, a receipt corresponding to a sales slip, or the like that becomes effective upon drawing of information, and to give the security to a customer.<br>
Although in this embodiment the printer main body 110 is of a thermal type and the printing medium is the thermal recording rolled sheet 116, it may be<br><br>
- a printer main body of an impact act type, an ink jet type, a laser type, or the like that performs drawing on a roll of recording paper, a separate recording sheet, or the like.<br>
As shown in Figs. 10A and 10B, the printer 100 with a locking mechanism according to this embodiment comprises a case 10 with a locking mechanism and a printer main body 110 that is housed in the case 10 with a locking mechanism. The printer main body 110, which is a printer that receives recording information and performs drawing on rolled sheet 116 incorporated therein, is equipped with an ejection mouth 112 through which a drawn part of the rolled sheet 116 is ejected, a printer cover 111 for covering the rolled sheet 116 without covering the ejection mouth 112, an open button 113 for opening the printer cover 111 from a closed position, a platen 125 ejecting a part of the rolled sheet 116, and a feed button 114 for activating the platen 125.<br>
The printer 100 with a locking mechanism is housed in the housing unit 30 of the above-described case 10 with a locking mechanism 60, and the cover 20 is locked with the housing unit 30 such that the printer cover 111, the open button 113, and the feed button 114 are covered with the cover 20, and the printer cover 111 is closed.<br>
A method of housing the printer main body 110 in the case 10 with a locking mechanism is as follows. When the cover 20 is opened, the printer main body 110 is inserted through the opening 37 and placed on the fixing portions 32a, 32b, 32c, and 32d of the bottom panel 31.<br>
The printer main body 110 is fixed to the bottom panel 31 by inserting screws 118 through the large,holes 32i, 32], 32k, and 32I that are formed through the bottom plate of the bottom panel 31, and screwing the screws 118<br><br>
into tapped holes (not shown) formed in the bottom portion of the printer main body 110.<br>
To fix the printer with a locking mechanism having the case 10 with a locking mechanism to a particular place such as a working stage, the case 10 can be fixed with a locking mechanism to the working stage by using the fixing holes 36a, 36b, 36c, and 36d formed through the bottom panel 31.<br>
As shown in Fig. 11. a printing system 200 comprises a printer main body 110 housed in a case 10 with a locking mechanism, a host computer (hereinafter referred to as "host") 201 connected to the printer main body by a signal cable 203, an electromagnetic actuator 71 that is part of a locking mechanism 60 of the case 10 with a locking mechanism, and a drawer (money box) 202 in the vicinity of the case 10 with a locking mechanism.<br>
The printer main body 110 incorporates a transmitter 117 that transmits an electric signal for opening the drawer 202. The transmitter 117 has two output systems. One output system is connected to the drawer 202 by a signal cable 203, and the other output system is connected, by a signal cable 203, to a solenoid 72 of the electromagnetic actuator 71 provided in the case 10 with a locking mechanism. The printer main body 110 operates receiving power externally.<br>
The host 201 transmits recording information for the printer main body 110, an instruction signal for opening the drawer 202, or like information when an input manipulation is performed on the host 201.<br>
If the host 201 sends an unlocking instruction signal for opening the drawer 202, in which the output system of the transmitter 117 connected to the electromagnetic  actuator 71   is  designated,  the transmitter  117  sends  an<br><br>
unlocking signal to the solenoid 72 of the electromagnetic actuator 71 and the solenoid 72 unlocks the locking member 61, that is, unlocks the cover 20 from the housing unit 30.<br>
Likewise, if the host 201 sends an unlocking instruction signal for opening the drawer 202 in which the output system of the transmitter 117 that is connected to the drawer 202 is designated, the transmitter 117 sends an unlocking signal to the drawer 202. The drawer 202 can thus be opened. The unlocking instruction signal transmitted from the host 201 to the printer main body 110 is not limited to an electric signal, and may be a command or the like, as would be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
To lead out the signal cables 203 that connect the printer main body 110 housed in the case 10 with a locking mechanism to the host 201 and the drawer 202, an opening (not shown) having a minimum necessary size is formed through the back panel 41 of the case 10 with a locking mechanism. Although the printing system 200 according to this embodiment is provided with the drawer 202 for when the printing system 200 is used as a POS system, the drawer 202 is not indispensable, as exemplified by a case when no cash is exchanged.<br>
The above-described first embodiment provides at least the following advantages:<br>
(1) In the case 10 with a locking mechanism, when the cover 20 is closed, the hook 22 of the cover 20 is engaged with the locking member 61. As a result, the cover 20 and the housing unit 30 can be locked with each other in a closed state, with the printer main body 110 housed in and fixed to the housing unit 30.<br><br>
Since the electromagnetic actuator 51 is equipped with the solenoid 72 for unlocking the locking member 61 in response to an electric signal, a person in charge of the management cf the system; for example but not by way of limitation, can unlock the cover 20 without the need for touching the case 10 with a locking mechanism, that is. by sending a first electric signal from the host 201 to the printer main body 110.<br>
Accordingly, remote control is enabled, and it becomes possible to prevent a third person from unauthorized removal of the printer main body 110 from the case 10 with a locking mechanism.<br>
(2)	Once the cover 20 and the housing unit 30 are locked to each other in a closed state, the locking member 61 cannot be unlocked unless the solenoid 72 of the electromagnetic actuator 71 is operated by an electric signal. Therefore, the closed state can be maintained even if the solenoid 72 fails.<br>
(3)	The locking mechanism 60 comprises the locking member 61 and the electromagnetic actuator 71, each of which is housed in the housing unit 30. Therefore, once the cover 20 and the housing unit 30 are locked to each other in a closed state with the printer main body 110 housed in the housing unit 30, unauthorized unlocking by destroying the locking mechanism 60 from the outside of the case 10 can be prevented. That is, it becomes possible to prevent the printer main body 110 from being easily taken out from the case 10 with a locking mechanism.<br>
(4)	The printer 100 with a locking mechanism is locked with the<br>
housing unit 30 such that the printer main body 110 is housed in the case 10<br>
with a locking mechanism, and the cover 20 is closed to cover the printer cover<br>
111, the open button 113,  and the feed button  114.     Unless the locking<br><br>
mechanism 60 is unlocked, the incorporated rolled sheet 116 cannct be taken out by opening the printer cover 111, or a part of the rolled sheet 116 cannot be ejected by depressing the feed button 114. This makes it possible to prevent unauthorized removal of the roiled sheet 116 incorporated in the printer main body 110.    .<br>
(5)	The electromagnetic actuator 71 that is part of the locking<br>
mechanism 60 of the printer 100 with a locking mechanism is connected to the<br>
transmitter 117 that is incorporated in the printer main body 110. When the<br>
printer main body 110 receives an unlocking instruction signal from the host 201,<br>
the solenoid 72 of the electromagnetic actuator 71 is operated by an unlocking<br>
signal that is output from the transmitter 117, and the locking member 61 is<br>
thereby unlocked. That is, the cover 20 can be unlocked by a remote control<br>
without directly touching the printer 100 with a locking mechanism.<br>
(6)	One of the two output systems of the transmitter 117 for the drawer 202 is used for transmitting an unlocking signal (second electric signal) from the printer main body 110 to the electromagnetic actuator 71. This makes it possible to unlock the electromagnetic actuator 71 without adding a transmitter (including an output terminal) dedicated to unlocking to the printer main body 110.<br>
(7)	The cover 20 is urged in the opening direction by springs stretched between the hooks 26a and 26b of the cover support portions 21a and 21b, and the hooks 44a and 44b of the back panel 41. Therefore, maintenance work, such as replacement of the rolled sheet 116 incorporated in the printer main body 110, on removal of a jammed part of the rolled sheet 116, can be performed easily without the need for supporting (e.g., with a hand) the cover 20<br><br>
opened.<br>
As shown in Figs. 12A and 12B, a printer 300 with a locking mechanism according to a second embodiment of the invention is such that the above-described printer main body 110 is housed in a case 308 with a locking mechanism.<br>
The case 308 with a locking mechanism comprises a housing unit 304 that is formed with an opening 304a and serves to house the printer main body 110, a holder frame (cover member) 301 that is opened and closed in a range about a shaft 309, and a locking mechanism 307 provided in the housing unit 304.<br>
The holder frame 301 assumes a bracket shape and comprises a holder 303 and arms 302. One of the ends of the arms 302 connected to the holder frame 301 at both ends are supported by an internal surface of the housing unit 304, that is, pivotally supported by shafts 309.<br>
The locking mechanism 307 is such that the electromagnetic actuator 71 shown in Fig. 8B is provided on a bottom surface 305 of the housing unit 304, and one of the arms 302 is provided with a lock member substantially similar to the locking member 61 of the first embodiment. The holder frame 301 is thus opened and closed.<br>
A back cover 306 is provided in the rear of the housing unit 304. The back cover 306 is formed to cover connectors or the like, to which signal cables or the like, provided on the back side of the printer main body 110, are connected when the printer main body 110 is housed in the housing unit 304.<br>
The printer 300 with a locking mechanism having the case 308 with a locking mechanism employs a printing system that is substantially similar to the<br><br>
printing system 200 shown in Fig. 11.<br>
Therefore, if the printer main body 110 is housed in and fixed to the housing unit 304, and the holder frame 301 is brought down to the front side, the holder frame 301 covers part of the printer cover 111, the open button 113, and the feed button 114 and is locked with the housing unit 304 in a substantially closed state.<br>
To effect unlocking, input manipulation is performed on the host 201 (see Fig. 11). The solenoid 72 of the electromagnetic actuator 71 is operated by an unlocking signal (second electric signal) output from the transmitter 117 incorporated in the printer main body 110 based on an unlocking instruction signal transmitted from the host 201 to the printer main body 110. The holder frame 301 is thereby unlocked.<br>
The second embodiment provides at least the following advantages:<br>
(1)	In the printer 300 with a locking mechanism, the printer main body 110 is housed in the case 308 with a locking mechanism, and the holder frame 301 is locked with the housing unit 304 in a closed state while covering part of the printer cover 111, the open button 113, and the feed button 114. Therefore, unless the locking mechanism 307 is unlocked, the incorporated rolled sheet 116 cannot be taken out by opening the printer cover 111, or, part of the rolled sheet 116 cannot be ejected by depressing the feed button 114. As a result, it is possible to prevent the rolled sheet 116 incorporated in the printer main body 110 from unauthorized removal.<br>
(2)	The electromagnetic actuator 71 which is part of the locking mechanism 307 of the printer 300 with a locking mechanism, is connected to-th-e transmitter 117 incorporated in the printer main body 110.   When the printer<br><br>
main body 110 receives an unlocking instruction signal from the host 201, the solenoid 72 of the electromagnetic actuator 71 is operated by an unlocking signal (second electric signal) transmitted from the transmitter 117, and the holder frame 301 is thereby unlocked. That is, the holder frame 301 can be unlocked by a remote control without directly touching the printer 300 with a locking mechanism.<br>
The configurations described in connection with the first and second embodiments may be modified as follows:<br>
The case 10 with a locking mechanism may be modified to be equipped with a cover 20 that covers the housing unit 30 almost fully, except for an opening 37 having a substantially minimum necessary area.<br>
The case 10 with a locking mechanism may be modified to be equipped with a housing unit 30 that is a casting, a plastic member, or the like as an integrated member of the bottom panel 31, the back panel 41, and the side panel 51.<br>
The means for unlocking the locking member 61 may use a motor or an actuator that is driven by electricity, pressurized air, oil, or the like.<br>
The printer 100 with a locking mechanism may be modified to be equipped with a case 10 with a locking mechanism having a cover 20 that can be locked with the housing unit 30 in a closed state while almost fully covering the printer main body 110, except for the ejection mouth 112 of the printer main body 110.<br>
The printing system may be modified such that the electromagnetic locking unit 71 unlocks the locking member 61 by receiving an unlocking signal (second electric signal) directly from the host 201.<br><br>
The cover 20 may be modified to cover only the printer cover 111, which makes it possible to prevent the roiled sheet 116 from being removed by opening the printer cover 111. In particular, even this modification is sufficiently effective when a printer main body 110 is not equipped with the feed button 114.<br>
The cover 20 may be modified to cover only the printer cover 111 and the feed button 114. This modification makes it possible to prevent the rolled sheet 116 from being taken out by opening the printer cover 111, as well as to prevent the rolled sheet 116 from being fed by depressing the feed button 114.<br>
Next, a third embodiment of the invention will be described. [0104] As shown in Fig. 13A, a printer main body 401 is applied to, for example but not by way of limitation, a printer that is used in a POS system or the like and serves to issue receipts.    The printer main body 401 performs printing on rolled sheet (printing medium) with a print head 424.<br>
The printer main body 401 is equipped with an ejection mouth 412 through which a part of the rolled sheet 416 is ejected, a printer cover 411 as a lid for covering the incorporated rolled sheet 416 without covering the ejection mouth 412, an open button 413 for opening the printer cover 411 being closed, a platen 425 for ejecting a part of the rolled sheet 416, a motor (not shown) for driving the platen 425, a feed button 414 for activating the platen 425, indication lamps 415 for indicating a state of the printer main body 401, and a locking mechanism 460 (see Fig. 14) for locking the printer cover 411 in a closed state. A back cover 401 a is provided behind the printer main body 401.<br>
The printer main body 401 comprises a case main body 404 capable of accommodating the rolled "sheet 416, the printer cover 411 attached to the case main body 404 to be openable and closable, and a printing mechanism 420 that<br><br>
is housed in the case main body 404.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13B: the printing mechanism 420 is equipped with a rolled sheet support frame ^22 that supports the roiled sheet 416 from below, and a rolled sheet cover 421 that covers the rolled sheet 416 from above.<br>
Further, a spring 430 that is provided in a main body frame 423 urges a thermal print head 424 toward the platen 425, whereby the print head 424 can print on the rolled sheet 416.<br>
Printing is performed as the platen 425 presses a part of the rolled sheet 416 against the print head 424. At the same time, the platen 425 feeds a part of the rolled sheet 416 in an ejecting direction D. After completion of a printing operation, a part of the rolled sheet 416 is cut by being put between a movable blade 428 that is driven by a motor 427 of an auto-cutter unit 426 and a fixed blade 429 that is provided on the side of the printer cover 411.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, the locking mechanism 460 comprises a cover frame 461 that is provided with an electromagnetic actuator 470, and a cover lever that is engaged with the cover frame 461.<br>
The electromagnetic actuator 470, which is provided in the cover frame 461, is equipped with a solenoid 471. The solenoid 471 is fixed to the cover frame 461 with screws 471b (see Fig. 15A). A plunger 474 of the solenoid 471 and an unlocking lever 472 are engaged with each other by a spring pin 471a. The unlocking lever 472 is engaged with a shaft 473 that projects from the cover frame 461.<br>
The unlocking lever 472 can be rotated in direction A about the shaft 473 by attracting the plunger 474 in a direction indicated by an arrow. Locking is effected when the unlocking lever 472 is engaged with a cam 464.<br><br>
A shaft 467a is inserted in a cam hole 464b and the cam 464 is thereby supported. A portion, engaged with the shaft 467a, of the cam hole 464b has a D-shaped cross section, whereby the cam 464 is prevented from rotation.<br>
The shaft 467a is fitted with E-rings (in this case, two E-rings) so that the cam 464 does not come off in the axial direction arid the engagement position of the cam 464 and the unlocking lever 472 is not deviated. The shaft 467a is supported by bearings 462a and 462c? whereby the shaft 467a is supported pivotally.<br>
The shaft 467a is inserted in a hole 469a of the cover lever 469. Also, a portion engaged with the shaft 467a of the hole 469a has a D-shaped cross section, whereby the cover lever 469 is prevented from rotation.<br>
On the other hand, a shaft 467b is inserted in a hole 469b of the cover lever 469 and the shaft 467 is attached to the bearing 462b, whereby the shaft 467b is supported pivotally. The shaft 467b is fitted with E-rings so as not to come off in the axial direction.<br>
A spring 465 is attached to a projection 472b of the unlocking lever 472, and a hook portion 465a of the spring 465 is attached to a shaft disengagement spring hook 466 that is provided on the cover frame 461. The spring 465 urges the unlocking lever 472 in a direction of pushing out the plunger 474.<br>
When the plunger 474 is attracted in the arrow direction by operating the solenoid 471 which is part of the electric unlocking mechanism, the unlocking lever 472 is rotated in direction A about the shaft 473. As a result, the unlocking lever 472 is disengaged from the cam 464 and unlocking is effected. Conversely, when the plunger 474 is released, the unlocking lever 472 is rotated by the spring 465 in the direction opposite to direction A, whereby the unlocking<br><br>
lever 472 is engaged with the cam 464 and locking is effected.<br>
The order of assembling of the locking mechanism 460 will be described below with reference to the exploded perspective view of Fig. 15A.<br>
First, the solenoid 471 is fixed to the cover frame 461 with the screws 471b. Then, the shaft 473 is inserted into the hole 472c of the unlocking lever 472 and is fitted with an E-ring 468.<br>
Then, the plunger 474 is set with respect to the unlocking lever 472 and the spring pin 471a is inserted into the hole 472d, whereby the plunger 474 and the unlocking lever 472 are engaged with each other.<br>
Then, the spring 465 is hooked on the projection 472b and the shaft disengagement spring hook 466. Subsequently, the hole 469a of the cover lever 469 and the bearing 462a are positioned with respect to each other, and the hole 469b and the bearing 462b are positioned with respect to each other. The shaft 467a is inserted into the hole 469a and the bearing 462a and is fitted with an E-ring 468.<br>
The shaft 467a is then inserted into the cam 464, and is fitted with E-rings 468 at positions close to both end faces of the cam 464. Theni the shaft 467a is inserted into the hole 463c of the bearing 462c and is fitted with an E-ring 468.<br>
The shaft 467b is then inserted into the hole 469b and the bearing 462b and is fitted with E-rings 468. The locking mechanism 460 is completed as a result of the assembling that is performed in the above order. The locking mechanism 460 is fixed to the printer main body 401 with screws 461a from the back side of the cover frame 461, whereby the assembling is substantially finished.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 15B, the cover lever 469 is set with respect to a lock unit 460a by rotating the cover lever 469 from the back cover 401 a of the printer main body 401.<br>
At this time, the cover lever 469 is set with respect to the lock unit 460a so as to cover the open button 413 and the feed button 414. Since the height H2 of the lock unit 460a is smaller than the height H1 of the back cover 401a, if the printer main body 401 is locked in this state, the cover lever 469 cannot be slid toward the back side of the printer main body 401, and hence cannot be removed from the printer main body 401.<br>
In this state, a person cannot manipulate the open button 413 or the feed button 414. Further, as shown in Fig. 16, when the locking mechanism 460 is fixed to the printer main body 401, an l/F unit such as connectors 504 (described later) cannot be seen from the outside, which makes it impossible to access the connectors 504 or transmit an unauthorized signal.<br>
Fitting the cover lever 469 from the back cover 401a of the printer main body 401 is facilitated by operating the solenoid 471 of the electromagnetic actuator 470 by an instruction from a host computer (hereinafter referred to as "host") 501, and thereby unlocking the locking mechanism 460 to establish a state such that the cam 464 and the unlocking lever 472 are not engaged with each other.<br>
On the other hand, after the cover lever 469 has been fitted from the back cover 401a of the printer main body 401, the locking mechanism 460 is locked by operating the solenoid 471 of the electromagnetic actuator 470 by an instruction from' the host 501. At this time, the cam 464 and the unlocking lever 472 are engaged with each other and the cover lever 469 is engaged with the<br><br>
lock unit 460a. With this structure, the cover lever 469 cannot be removed from the printer main body 401.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17A. a printer 600 with a locking mechanism (i.e., the locking mechanism 460) is completed (see Figs. 17A and 17B) by moving the cover frame 461 equipped with the locking mechanism 460 in a direction indicated by an arrow and thereby attaching it to the case main body 404.<br>
As shown in Figs. 16 and 18, the connectors 504 are provided inside the printer main body 401 so as to be connected to signal cables 503. The connectors 504 include a connector 504a that is selected by a received signal and serves for signal exchange when connected to the host 501, a connector 504b that serves for signal exchange when connected to a drawer 502 and the electromagnetic actuator 470, and a connector 504c that serves for supply of power when connected to an external power supply.<br>
By connecting the host 501 to the connector 504a by a signal cable 503, a signal can be transmitted from the host 501 to the printer main body 401.<br>
By connecting the drawer 502 to the connector 504b by a signal cable 503, a signal can be transmitted from the printer main body 401 to the drawer 502. Further, the connector 504b is constructed so that its connection pins (not shown) can be used in a divisional manner, so that a signal can also be transmitted from the printer main body 401 to the electromagnetic actuator 470.<br>
On the other hand, by connecting the external power supply (not shown) to the connector 504c, power can be supplied externally.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17A, the printer 600 with a locking mechanism comprises the printer main body 401 for performing printing on the rolled sheet 416 and the locking mechanism 460 for locking the printer main body 401.<br><br>
The locking mechanism 460 comprises the electromagnetic actuator 470, the cover frame 461, and the cover lever 469 that is attached to the cover frame 461. The cover lever 469 is rotated in a direction indicated by an arrow so as to cover the open button 413 and the feed button 414.<br>
When the cover frame 461 is fixed to the case main body 404, the electromagnetic actuator 470 is incorporated into the printer main body 401 and hence cannot be seen from the outside. Further, the cover lever 469 is supported by the shafts 467a and 467b, that is, it can be rotated from the back side of the printer main body 401 to the front side on or about the shafts 467a and 467b (see Fig. 14).<br>
As shown in Fig. 17B, when the locking mechanism is operated, locking is effected with the open button 413 and the feed button 414 that are covered with the cover lever 469. At this time, the cover lever 469 is locked with the lock unit 460a. Further, since as mentioned above the height H1 of the back cover 401a is greater than the height H2 of the lock unit 460a (see Fig. 15B), the cover lever 469 cannot rotate in a direction indicated by an arrow. That is, in the lock state, the open button 413 and the feed button 414 cannot be manipulated easily from the outside.<br>
As shown in Fig. 18, a printing system 500 comprises a printer main body 401 for performing printing on rolled sheet 416, a host 501 that is connected to the printer main body 401 by a signal cable 503, an electromagnetic actuator 470 in a locking mechanism 460, and a drawer 502 as a money box for storing money.<br>
The drawer 502 comprises a drawer opening mechanism 490/a' drawer 491, and a box 492.   The host can open the drawer 502 by sending a<br><br>
drawer unlocking signal to the drawer opening mechanism 490 via the printer main body 401.<br>
Further, the host 501 can unlock the locking mechanism 460 by sending an electromagnetic unlocking signal to the electromagnetic actuator 470 that is incorporated in the printer main body 401.<br>
The signal cables 503 are used for signal exchange between the host 501 and the printer main body 401, and between the printer main body 401 and the drawer 502.<br>
As shown in Fig. 19, the printing system 500 is configured such that an input manipulation of a print information instruction for the printer main body 401, a drawer unlocking instruction for opening the drawer 502, an electromagnetic unlocking instruction for unlocking the electromagnetic actuator 470, a valid/invalid switching instruction for the feeding controller 480, or the like is performed on the host 501, and an operation corresponding to such an instruction to the host 501 is performed.<br>
The drawer opening mechanism 490 for controlling drawer unlocking is connected to the printer main body 401. The printer main body 401 is equipped with the electromagnetic actuator 470 for controlling the locking mechanism 460, a feeding controller 480 for controlling a transport operation on the rolled sheet 416, and a transmitter 517 for transmitting an electric signal to the electromagnetic actuator 470, the feeding controller 480, and the drawer 502.<br>
The transmitter 517 can transmit a signal to three systems in accordance.with an instruction from the'host 501. Among those systems, the first system can open the drawer 502 so that the drawer 491 can be pulled out of<br><br>
the box 492 by sending a drawer unlocking signal to the drawer opening mechanism 490.<br>
The second system can unlock the locking mechanism 460 by sending an electromagnetic unlocking signal to the electromagnetic actuator 470 or lock the locking mechanism 460 (see Fig. 14).<br>
The third system can switch between a valid state and an invalid state of the feed mechanism by sending a feed mechanism valid/invalid switching signal from the host 501 to the feeding controller 480. If the feeding controller 480 is switched to the invalid side (off side), the rolled sheet 416 cannot be transported. In this case, a stop state is maintained in which the rolled sheet 416 cannot be transported (fed), even if the feed button 414 is manipulated externally.<br>
If the host 501 sends a feed mechanism valid switching signal to the feeding controller 480, a paper feed operation is performed. Since the feeding controller 480 performs a paper feed operation, a paper feed can be performed even if the locking mechanism 460 prevents manipulation of the feed button 414.<br>
The operations of the printing system 500 and the locking mechanism 460 will be described below.<br>
As shown in Figs. 13A and 13B, in the printer main body 401, the print head 424 prints on a part of the rolled sheet 416 and the printed part of the rolled sheet 416 is fed in direction D as the platen 425 that is the feed member of the feed mechanism is operated upon depression of the feed button 414. At ttus time, a paper feed state is indicated by the indication lamps 415. The printed part of the rolled sheet 416 is cut by the auto-cutter unit 426 and ejected<br><br>
) the outside through the ejection mouth 412.<br>
As shown in Figs. 18 and 19, in the printing system 500, a signal is ■ansmitted from the host to the printer main body 401 when an input lanipulation is performed on the host 501. This signal is transmitted from the ■ansmitter 517 incorporated in the printer main body 401 to the electromagnetic ictuator 470, the feeding controller 480, or the drawer 502.<br>
If an unlocking instruction signal for opening the drawer 502 is •ansmitted from the host 501 to the printer main body 401 while the output ystem, connected to the drawer 502 of the transmitter 517 is designated, the ransmitter 517 sends an unlocking signal (second electric signal) to the drawer &gt;02. Therefore, the drawer opening mechanism 490 operates to allow the irawer 491 to be pulled out of the box 492. Money or the like stored in the box i92 can be taken out.<br>
If a feed mechanism valid/invalid switching instruction signal is ransmitted from the host 501 to the printer main body 401 while the output jystem, connected to the feeding controller 480, of the transmitter 517 is Jesignated, the transmitter 517 sends a feed mechanism valid/invalid switching &gt;ignal to the feeding controller 480. Therefore, the feeding controller 480 operates to allow switching between the valid state and the invalid state of the eed mechanism. Likewise, if a paper feed instruction signal is transmitted from he host 501 to the printer main body 401, the transmitter 517 sends a paper eed signal to the feeding controller 480. Therefore, the feeding controller 480 operates to allow a paper feed.<br>
If an electromagnetic unlocking instruction signal is transmitted from he host 501 to the printer main body 401 while the output system connected to<br><br>
the feeding controller 480 of the transmitter 517 is designated, the transmitter 517 sends a drive signal (second electric signal) to the solenoid 471 of the electromagnetic actuator 470.<br>
As shown in Fig. 14, wnen the solenoid 471 that is part of the electric unlocking mechanism is driven, the plunger 474 is attracted. At this time, the unlocking lever 472 is swung in the direction indicated by arrow A, whereby the cam 464 is disengaged from the unlocking lever 472, that is, unlocking is effected.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17A. when unlocking has succeeded, the opening button 413 and the feed button 414 are made visible by rotating (sliding) the cover lever 469 to the back cover 401a of the printer main body 401. That is, the opening button 413 and the feed button 414 are rendered externally manipulable. The printer cover 411 is opened and replacement of the rolled sheet 416 is enabled by manipulating the open button 413. The rolled sheet 416 is fed and a part of the rolled sheet 416 is ejected through the ejection mouth 412 by manipulating the feed button 414.<br>
As shown in Fig. 17B, if the cover lever 469 is then rotated from the back cover 401a of the printer main body 401 to the front side, the opening button 413 and the feed button 414 are covered with the cover lever 469.<br>
If in this state a locking instruction signal is transmitted from the host 501 to the printer main body 401, the transmitter 517 sends a non-drive signal to the solenoid 471 of the electromagnetic actuator 470. Therefore, the energization of the solenoid 471 is stopped and the plunger 474 is released. At this time, the unlocking lever 472 is rotated in the direction that is'opposite to the direction indicated by arrow A by the urging force of the spring 465, whereby the<br><br>
cam 464 is engaged with the unlocking lever 472 and locking is effected (see Fig. 14).<br>
The cover lever 469 is made of a metal material such as iron, stainless steel, or copper. The size of the cover lever 469 is such as to be able to cover the open button 413 and the feed button 414. In addition, the cover lever 469 is so thick as not to be broken even if impact is applied to it externally; that is, it is mechanically rigid.<br>
The above-described embodiment provides at least the following independent advantages:<br>
(1)	Since the locking mechanism 460 having the electric unlocking mechanism is provided inside the printer main body 401, one cannot recognize from outside the printer main body 401 that the locking mechanism 460 is provided inside the printer main body 401. Further, the electric unlocking mechanism can unlock the locking mechanism 460 in response to an instruction from the host 501. Still further, since the back cover 401a behind the printer main body 401 is taller than the lock unit 460a, the cover lever 469 cannot be removed from the printer main body 401 once the locking mechanism 460 is locked. This prevents a party from easily taking out the rolled sheet 416 that is provided inside the printer main body 401. The printer 600 with a locking mechanism can thus be provided in which the rolled sheet 416 that has not been subjected printing yet cannot be taken out.<br>
(2)	Since the feeding controller 480 is provided in the printer main body 401, the host 501 can send a paper feed valid/invalid switching instruction to the<br>
._ printer main body 401.    If paper feeding is set invalid in advance, a paper feed cannot be performed. Hence, a part of the rolled sheet 416 is not ejected<br><br>
through the ejection mouth 412. The printer 600 with a locking mechanism can thus be provided in which a third person cannot easily take out the rolled sheet 416 provided inside the printer main body 401 and has not been subjected printing yet.<br>
(3) Since the printer main body 401 is equipped with the cover lever 469, the feed button 414 is covered with the cover lever 469, which disables an external feed manipulation. The printer 600 with a locking mechanism can thus be provided in which a third person cannot take out the rolled sheet 416 without authorization.<br>
Although in the third embodiment the cover- lever 469 is supported by the shafts 467a and 467b. the invention is not limited to such a case. For example but not by way of limitation, it is possible to cut the cover lever 469 and to cause a remaining part of the cover lever 469 to be supported by the one shaft 467a. That is, the remaining part of the cover lever 469 is provided only in the side where the open button 413 and the feed button 414 exist.<br>
This structure provides the same advantages as the third embodiment does while allowing the open button 413 and the feed button 414 to be covered. In addition, the bearing 462b and the shaft 467b which are part of the locking mechanism 460 are not necessary, which reduces the number of parts and simplifies the structure. This makes it possible to provide a printer with a locking mechanism that has such a locking mechanism 460.<br>
Although in the third embodiment the material of the cover lever 469 is a metal that is high in rigidity, the invention is not limited to such a case. For example, the cover lever 469 may be made of a material such as plastic that is easy to mold and inexpensive, as long as it has a certain level of rigidity.<br><br>
This embodiment makes it possible to reduce the cost by forming the cover lever 469 by integrally by molding, for example, while providing the same advantages as the third embodiment does. A printer with a locking mechanism having such a locking mechanism 460 can be provided.<br>
Although in the third embodiment the locking mechanism 460 is operated by using the solenoid 471 as part of the electromagnetic actuator 470, the invention is not limited to such a case. For example, the locking mechanism 460 may be operated by using a pneumatic, a hydraulic cylinder, or the like.<br>
Although in the third embodiment the cover lever 469 is provided so as to cover the open button 413 and the feed button 414, the invention is not limited to such a case. For example, the cover lever 469 may be provided so as to cover only the feed button 414 (i.e., the open button 413 is not covered).<br>
In this embodiment, when the locking mechanism 460 is locked, even if the open button 413 is depressed the printer cover 411 is not opened and hence the rolled sheet 416 cannot be taken out because the cover lever 469 is pressing the printer main body 401. In addition, since the feed button 414 is covered with the cover lever 469, a paper feed manipulation cannot be performed. The substantially same advantages as provided by the third embodiment can thus be obtained.<br>
A printing system maybe provided in which the electromagnetic actuator 470 receives an unlock signal (second electric signal) directly from the host 501, and the electric unlocking mechanism unlocks the locking mechanism 460.<br>
While the invention has been described above with reference to the<br><br>
embodiment, the technical range of the invention is not restricted to the range described in the embodiment. It is apparent to the skilled in the art that various changes or improvements can be made in the embodiment.
