Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds exhibiting thrombopoietin receptor agonism.<br>
Background Art<br>
Thrombopoietin, polypeptide cytokine composed of 332 amino acids, activates the production of platelets by stimulating the differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytes through the receptor and is expected as a medicine for hemopathy accompanied with the unusual number of platelets, for example, thrombocytopenia and the like. DNA sequences encoding the thrombopoietin receptor have been described in Non-Patent 1. Low molecular peptides having an affinity for the thrombopoietin receptor is also known in Patent 1 and Patent 2, but these peptide derivatives are not generally practical for oral administration.<br>
As a low molecule compound having an affinity to the thrombopoietin receptor, 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives are described in Patent 3 and Patent 4, 1-azonaphthalene derivatives are described in Patent 5, N-(4-phenyl-l,3-thiazol-2-yl)carboxamide derivatives are described in Patent 6, Patent 7, Patent 8, Patent 9, and Patent 10.<br>

Test Examples<br>
Test Example 1    Isolation and purification of Thrombopoietin (TPO)<br>
Human TPO (hTPO) and murine TPO (mTPO) were purchased from R&amp;D Systems.<br>
Test Example 2    The thrombopoietic activity<br>
The TPO dependent BaF/hTPOR cell line which was established by introducing human TPO receptor (hTPOR) into BaF-B03 cells according to Collins et al (J. Cell. PhysioL, 137:293-298 (1988)) was used to test the thrombopoietic activity of the present compound. The DNA sequences and encoded peptide sequences for human hTPOR have been described by Vigon et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 89:5640-5644 (1992)). TPO dose not have any ability to support proliferation of interlukin-3 dependent parental cell line BaF-B03. BAF/hTPOR cells were maintained in RPMI medium and WEHI-3B conditioned medium as a source of murine interleukin-3 (IL-3). These cells were washed and resuspended in RPMI medium without a source of murine<br><br>
IL-3 and seeded into each well of 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 5 X104 cells per well in the absence or presence of various concentration of hTPO or the present compound. After incubation at 37°C for 20 hours in the 5% CO2 incubator, 10% WST-1 reagent (Takara Biomedicals, Japan) was added to each wells and the cells were further incubated for 4 hours. The absorbance at 450 nm was measured. Tables 1 and 2 exemplify the ED50 for tested compounds of the present invention, wherein the ED50 is the half concentration of the concentration showing the maximum thrombopoietic activity.<br><br><br><br><br>
