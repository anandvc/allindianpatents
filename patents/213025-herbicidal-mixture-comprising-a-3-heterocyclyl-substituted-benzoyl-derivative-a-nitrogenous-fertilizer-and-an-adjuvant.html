The herbicidal mixture according to the invention comprises the following amounts of the components a) to c):<br>
0.5 to 90% by weight of the 3-heterocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivative a);<br>
5 to 94.5% by weight of the nitrogenous fertilizer b);<br>
5 to 50% by weight of the adjuvant c).<br>
Preferred weight ratios are:<br>
0.5 to 50% by weight of the 3-heterocyclyl-substituted benzoyl derivative a);<br>
5 to 90% by weight of the nitrogenous fertilizer b);<br>
5 to 50% by weight of the adjuvant c).<br>
The components together add up to 100% by weight.<br>
The individual components a) to c) of the herbicidal mixture according to the invention can be formulated and packaged jointly or individually. Furthermore, it is possible to formulate and pack the components a) together with b), or a) together with c).<br>
The practitioner uses the herbicidal mixture or its individual components for use in the spray tank.<br>
For this purpose, the herbicidal mixture is diluted with water, adding, if appropriate, other auxiliaries and additives. However, the practitioner may also mix the individual components a) to c) of the herbicidal mixture according to the invention himself in the spray tank and, if appropriate, add further auxiliaries and additives (tank mix method).<br><br>
For the tank mix method, the components a) to c) are mixed in the spray tank and made up to the desired use concentration with water.<br>
The following adjuvants have proved advantageous for the tank mix method:<br>
mineral oils, liquid paraffins, vegetable oils, hydrogenated or methylated vegetable oils, such as, for example, soya oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower oil, esters and salts of natural carboxylic acids, such as, for example, methyl oleate, methylated seed oils, nonionic surfactants, such as ethoxylated alcohols, ethoxylated phenols, fatty amine ethoxylates, and mixtures of these.<br>
Further auxiliaries and additives may be added for better processing. The following components have proved themselves as auxiliaries and additives:<br>
solvents, antifoams, buffers, thickeners, spreading agents, compatibility-enhancing agents.<br>
Examples and brands of adjuvants, auxiliaries and additives are described in Farm Chemicals Handbook 1997; Meister Publishing 1997 p. C10 "adjuvant" or 1998 Weed Control Manual p. 86.<br>
The mixture according to the invention is suitable as herbicide. The herbicidal mixture effects very good control of vegetation on non-crop areas, especially at high rates of application. In crops such as wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and cotton it acts against broad-leaved weeds and grass weeds without damaging the crop plants substantially. This effect is observed especially at low rates of application.<br>
Depending on the application method in question the herbicidal mixture can additionally be employed in a further number of crop plants for eliminating undesirable plants. Examples of suitable crops are the following:<br>
Allium cepa. Ananas comosus, Arachis hypogaea. Asparagus officinalis, Beta vulgaris spec, altissima. Beta vulgaris spec, rapa, Brassica napus var. napus, Brassica napus var. napobrassica, Brassica rapa var. silvestris. Camellia sinensis, Carthamus tinctorius, Carya illinoinensis. Citrus limon. Citrus sinensis, Coffea arabica (Coffea canephora, Coffea liberica),<br><br>
Cucumis sativus, Cynodon dactylon, Daucus carota, Elaeis guineensis, Fragaria vesca, Glycine max, Gossypium hirsutum, (Gossypium arboreuin, Gossypium herbaceum, Gossypium vitifolium), Helianthus annuus, Hevea brasiliensis, Hordeum vulgare, Humulus lupulus, Ipomoea batatas, Juglans regia, Lens culinaris,   Linum usitatissimum, Lycopersicon lycopersicum, Malus spec, Manihot esculenta, Medicago sativa, Musa spec, Nicotiana tabacum (N.rustica), Olea europaea, Oryza sativa, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, Picea abies, Pinus spec, Pisum sativum, Prunus avium, Prunus persica, Pyrus communis, Ribes sylvestre, Ricinus communis, Saccharum officinarum, Secale cereale, Solanum tuberosum, Sorghum bicolor (s. vulgare), Theobroma cacao, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, Triticum durum, Vicia faba, Vitis vinifera and Zea mays.<br>
Moreover, the herbicidal mixture can also be used in crops which tolerate the action of herbicides due to breeding including genetic engineering methods.<br>
The herbicidal mixture can be applied pre- or post-emergence. If the herbicidal mixture is less well tolerated by certain crop plants, application techniques may be used in which the herbidical mixture is sprayed, with the aid of the spray apparatus, in such a way that it comes into little contact, if any, with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants while reaching the leaves of undesirable plants which grow underneath, or the bare soil (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The herbicidal mixture can be employed, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend on the intended purposes; in any case, they should guarantee the finest possible distribution of the herbicidal mixture according to the invention.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries are essentially: mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point such as kerosene and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffin, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, or strongly polar solvents, e.g.<br><br>
amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone ana water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water- To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the herbicidal mixture, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. However, it is also possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal, alkaline earth metal and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. lignosulfonic acid, phenolsulfonic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl-and alkylarylsulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta-and octadecanols, and of fatty alcohol glycol ether, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene, or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids, with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethylene octylphenyl ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl- or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl and tributylphenyl polyglycol ethers, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers or polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignin-sulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the herbicidal mixture with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeixeous granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powder or other solid carriers.<br><br>
The concentrations of the herbicidal mixture in the ready-to-use products can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of the herbicidal mixture. The components of the mixture are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>

The active ingredient is neutralized with dilute potassium hydroxide solution (KOH) and the formulation is brought to pH 8.5. 500 g of AG 6202 are incorporated into the formulation by stirring. After homogenization, the pH is rechecked and, if necessary, corrected. The product is then made up to 1 liter.<br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to achieve synergistic effects, the herbicidal mixture can be mixed and applied jointly with a large number of representatives of other groups of herbicidally or growth-regulatory active ingredients. Suitable components in mixtures are, for example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric acid and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, (het)-aryloxyalkanoic acids and their derivatives, benzoic acid and its derivatives, benzothiadiazinones, 2-aroyl-l,3-cyclohexandiones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzylisoxazolidinones, meta-CFs-phenyl derivates, carbamates, quinolinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines, dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic acids and their derivatives, ureas, 3-phenyluracils, imidazoles, imidazolinones, N-phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydrophtha-limides, oxadiazoles, oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- or<br>
heteroaryloxyphenoxypropionic esters, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives, phenylpropionic acid and its derivatives, pyrazoles, phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives, pyrimidyl ethers, sulfonylureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones, triazolecarboxamides and uracils.<br><br>
Moreover, it may be advantageous to apply the herbicidal mixture, alone or in combination with other herbicides, in the form of a mixture with additional other crop protection agents, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling phytophathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies.<br>
The application rate of herbicidal mixture amounts to 0.001 to ' 1.0, preferably 0.01 to 0.5, kg/ha active substance (a. s.), based on the pure components of the herbicidal mixture, depending on the intended aim, the season, the target plants and the growth stage.<br>
Use example<br>
The herbicidal action of the compositions according to the invention was demonstrated by greenhouse experiments:<br>
The culture containers used were plastic pots containing loamy sand with approximately 3.0% of humus as substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown separately for each species.<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the herbicidal mixture, suspended or emulsified in water, was applied directly after sowing by means of finely distributing nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and subsequently covered with translucent plastic hoods until the plants had rooted. This cover caused uniform germination of the test plants unless this was adversely affected by the herbicidal mixture.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were grown to a plant height of from 3 to 15 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated with the herbicidal mixture which had been suspended or emulsified in water. To this end, the test plants were either sown directly and grown in the same containers, or they were first grown separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to treatment.<br>
Depending on the species, the plants were kept at 10 - 25^0 or 20 - 35Â°C. The test period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the plants were tended, and their response to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br><br>
Evaluation was carried out using a scale of from 0 to 100. 100 means no emergence of the plants, or complete destruction of at least the aerial parts, and 0 means no damage or normal course of growth.<br>
The plants used in the greenhouse experiments belonged to the following species:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
