				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel alkyl-cycloalkyl thiophene copolymers useful for light emitting diode applications.<br>
Inorganic systems are conventionally used for light emitting diode applications. The methods of preparation associated with these systems are, however, very complicated and costly. Moreover, fluorescence is produced only upto the range of green radiation and it will be usually only monochromatic.<br>
The above shortcomings of the inorganic systems can be overcome by employing organic systems. Optical and photonic applications of π-conjugated polymers have recently been of much interest in the applications of microelectronics. To be potentially useful in electronic applications, polymer should either be a solution or a melt processable material with high environmental stability. Solubility of a polymer can be enhanced by substituting the appropriate side groups. Thiophene polymers and blends are predominantly used as semiconductors. They find their applications in constructing various rectifying junctions and polymer based light emitting diodes. These polymers also have potential use in panel displays.<br>
As reported by Abdou et al ( Synthetic. Metals. 52, 159 1992) and Roncali ( Journal, of Chemical Reviews, 92, 711, 1992), polyalkyl thiophenes, which not only exhibit the interesting properties of π-conjugated polymers, but also are easy to handle, have attracted considerable attention of the researchers. Bellettete et al (Macromolecules, 28, 8587, 1995), Pomerantz et al (Macromolecules, 28, 5706, 1995) and Roncali (Journal, of Chemical Reviews, 97, 173, 1997) have reported that the enhanced steric<br><br>
hindrance from side groups lead to decreasing planarity of the main chain and an increasing band gap, ensuring the potential use of the polymer in light emitting diodes. Several homopolymers like pure hexyl thiophene and cyclohexyl thiophene have been tried for light emitting diodes. The main limitation of this homopolymer system is that its efficiency level is very less and although it is possible to get fluorescence at blue radiation level, which is obviously an improvement over the conventional inorganic system, yet the radiation achieved is still only monochromatic.<br>
Berggners et al (Nature, 372, 444, 1994), Andersson et al (Macromolecules, 28, 7525, 1995) and Sandman (Trends in Polymer Science, 5, 71, 1997) blended different homopolymers physically to produce light emitting diodes with varied colour emittance.But the main drawback associated with these polymer blends is that the properties of the final products depend on the compatibility among the constituent homopolymers. Thus the efficiency of light emission of the light emitting diodes is affected depending on the nature of the polymer blend used.<br>
Attempts have therefore been made by researchers to improve the light emission properties of polythiophenes by synthesising copolymers, wherein properties of the constituent homopolymers are incorporated. Lowe and Holdcraft (Macromolecules, 28, 4608,1995) synthesised copolymers based on poly (3-(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)thiophene), which was reported to find application in photoresists. Blohm et al (Macromolecules, 26, 2704 1993) and Danieli et al. (Journal of Chemical Society Communication, 1473, 1986) studied in detail the copolymeric<br><br>
systems like Poly (3,4-dibutoxy thiophene vinylene) and Poly (thienylene phyenylene) copolymers for differrent electronic applications.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to    provide a process for the<br>
preparation   of novel alkyl-cycloalkyl thiophene copolymers useful for light emitting<br>
diode applications, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to use alkyl thiophenes in light emitting<br>
diodes applications to get better efficiency and varied range of colour emittance for<br>
applications like panel displays.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to prepare copolymers having very<br>
high regularity with high bandgaps.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to prepare     polythiophene<br>
copolymers having high solubility with very good thin film forming characteristics.<br>
In the drawings accompanying this specification,<br>
Formula I    represents alkyl thiophene, wherein R = any alkyl such as pentyl, hexyl,<br>
heptyl, octyl.<br>
Formula II    represents   cycloalkyl   thiophene wherein RI = any cycloalkyl such as<br>
cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl, cycloctyl.<br>
Formula III   represents alkyl-cycloalkyl thiophene copolymer, where n, X and Y are<br>
integers.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of novel alkyl-cycloalkyl  thiophene  copolymers  useful  for  light emitting diode  applications,  which comprises copolymerising alkyl thiophene and cycloalkyl thiophene in a ratio ranging from 1:0.1 to 1:10<br>
in an organic solvent such as herein described in inert atmosphere in the presence of an oxidising agent in the range of 1-5 moles per mole of monomer mixture at a temperature in the range of 0-30 C for a period ranging 3-48 hrs; precipitating the copolymer formed with non- solvent as herein described extracting the copolymer by known method.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the oxidising agent used is selected from ferric chloride, potassium persulphate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the non-solvent used is selected from as methanol, acetone, water.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used is selected from chloroform, acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, dichloromethane.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the oxidising agent used is in the range of 1-5 moles per mole of mixture.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used is in the range of 5-12 lit. Per mole of the oxidising agent used for the copolymerization.<br><br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the composition of the copolymers can be varied by changing the feed ratio of the binary mixture of alkyl thiophene and cycloalkyl thiophene.<br>
Cycloalkyl thiophene and alkyl thiophene are the basic monomers,which are synthesised<br>
by cross coupling halothiophene with  alkyl halide using nickel catalyst by a known<br>
method.<br>
Alkyl thiophene is copolymerised with cycloalkyl thiophene in a molar ratio ranging<br>
from 1:0.1 to 1:10 in presence of an oxidising agent dissolved in an organic solvent at<br>
a temperature in the range of   0°- 30°C    over a period of 3-48 hrs in an inert<br>
atmosphere. The copolymer formed is precipitated by a non-solvent in a conventional<br>
way. This precipitate is dissolved in an organic solvent and made into films, which are<br>
extracted in a known way to remove excess oxidising agent.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in the choosing of the monomers and the<br>
method used for their copolymerisation to form a novel compound which may<br>
successfully be used in the fabrication of light emitting diode devices.<br>
This invention is described in detail in the following examples which are provided<br>
by way of  illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>

chloride was added over 1 hr. After stirring for 3 hrs, the contents were refluxed for 24 hrs in a water bath. The contents were cooled and Ig of nickel catalyst was added followed by 82 g of bromothiophene and then refluxed for 48 hrs. The contents were neutralised with dilute hydrochloric acid extracted with ether and the ether layer was evaporated to dryness. the liquid obtained was purified using silica gel and finally distilled in order to get pure monomer of cyclohexyl thiophene. Similarly, n-hexyl thiophene was synthesised by replacing cyclohexyl chloride with hexyl chloride. 6gms. of anhydrous ferric chloride and 30ml. of dry chloroform were taken in a round bottom flask fitted with a condenser, and a dropping funnel. A binary mixture containing 0.2ml. of hexyl thiophene and 0.3 ml of cyclohexyl thiophene, dissolved in 10 ml. of chloroform was taken in the funnel and the contents of the flask were kept in a thermostatic bath, maintained at 0°C./ Oxygen free nitrogen was bubbled through the solution throughout the reaction. The monomers were added drop by drop for 1 hr. and the contents were stirred for 24 hrs. The copolymer was precipitated with 1 lit. of methanol.The copolymer was extracted using a soxhlet apparatus with methanol and acetone. Example-2<br>
