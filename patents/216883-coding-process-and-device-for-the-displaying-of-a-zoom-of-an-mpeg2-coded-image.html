				<td>Coding process and dovice for the displaying of a zoom of an MPEG2<br>
coded image<br>
The invention relates to a coding and decoding process and<br>
device compatible with the MPEG2 standard for displaying a zoom of a<br>
transmitted image. Performing a zoom of an image consists in enlarging or<br>
reducing a part of this image. It therefore involves a modification of the<br>
horizontal and vertical dimensions of the image part selected for display in<br>
zoom mode.<br>
Nowadays, applications based on interactivity necessitate the<br>
ability to view images in reduced or magnified form. For example, electronic<br>
program guides utilize images of reduced sizes so as to allow display on the<br>
screen of ancillary information in OSD form (standing for On Screen Display).<br>
Magnification may also be necessary in the case where one wishes to focus<br>
the display on a part of the source image.<br>
The process proposed can be used by any type of apparatus<br>
utilizing a stream of data coded according to the MPEG2 standard, for<br>
example a decoder, a DVD reader/recorder, an Internet box, etc. The<br>
transmission of the data may be transmission by satellite, by cable, terrestrial<br>
transmission, etc.<br>
MPE32 compression is not an object-based processing and the<br>
decoded image displayed is generally a copy of the coded source image. To<br>
achieve a specific display in zoom mode, it is therefore necessary to code<br>
the source image such as it must be displayed, that is to say afterhaving<br>
performed the zoom on this source image. Thus, the source image,<br>
originating for example from a studio providing a video sequence, is<br>
processed before the coding and transmission of the video data. The zoom<br>
operations are performed on this source image and it is the new "zoomed"<br>
image which is coded like the other images of the video sequence. The<br>
drawback of such a process stems from the lack of flexibility which it<br>
imposes. The zooms to be carried out must be decided on at the time of<br>
coding. These zooms can then no longer be modified on receipt of the data,<br>
at the decoder level, for example as a function of data or parameters<br>
selected by the viewer.<br>
The aim of the invention is to alleviate the aforesaid drawbacks.<br>
Accordingly, the subject of the invention is a coding process<br>
allowing the display of a zoom of an image coded according to the MPEG2<br>
standard, the zoomed image being defined by its horizontal and vertical<br>
homothefy ratio with respect to the coded image, characterized in that it<br>
performs the following steps:<br>
- calculation of the horizontal and vertical sizes of an initial display<br>
rectangle from which would be obtained the sizes of thE-target display<br>
rectangle as defined by the profile and level information by applying the<br>
horizontal and vertical homothety ratios,<br>
- storage in the dispiay_horizontal_size and display_vertical_size<br>
fields of an MPEG2 video data stream of the horizontal and vertical sizes of<br>
the initial display rectangle.<br>
According to a variant, the zoomed image being defined by its location in the<br>
displayed image in the event of a diminishrnent or by the part of the coded<br>
image to be displayed in the event of a magnification, the above process is<br>
characterized in that it also performs the following steps:<br>
- calculation of the corresponding position of the centre of the<br>
initial display rectangle with respect to the centre of the coded image so as to<br>
define a horizontal and vertical offset,<br>
- storage of an item of information defining the horizontal and<br>
vertical offset in the Trame centre_horizontal offset and<br>
frame_centre_vertical offset fields of the MPEG2; video data stream.<br>
Its subject is also a coding device for implementing the above<br>
coding process, characterTzedin that it comprises a syntax modifier linked to<br>
an MPEG coder for modifying the display_horizontal_size and<br>
display_vertical_size fields and the frame_centre_horizontal_offset and<br>
frame_centre_verlical offset fields of the MPEG2 data stream originating<br>
from the coder, respectively as a function of the amplitude and of the<br>
position of the desired zoom.<br>
According to a variant, the above device is characterized in that it<br>
comprises an application synchronizer linked to the coder and to the syntax<br>
modifier for controlling the syntax modification between two temporal code<br>
instants tcO and tc1 of the MPEG2 data stream corresponding to the images<br>
for which the zoom function is desired.<br>
The idea of the invention is to transport a certain number of<br>
parameters relating to the zoom of the image in fields defined in the syntax<br>
of the binary stream of video data coded according to the video MPEG2<br>
standard. The fields are chosen from among the extensions provided for in<br>
the standard. Thus, the coder can dynamically manage the parameters<br>
relating to the zoom, that is to say the dimension of the image to be viewed,<br>
its location in the image displayed, the part of the coded image to be viewed<br>
in zoom mode, doing so without changing the coding parameters such as the<br>
horizontal dimension and vertical dimension of the coded image.<br>
The various existing fields, in the video MPEG2 standard<br>
(ISO/CEI Standard 13818-2), relating to the size of the images to be coded<br>
and to be displayed are recalled hereinbelow:<br>
The dimension of the coded image or more exactly of the<br>
displayable image is defined in the sequence header of the MPEG2 data<br>
stream (paragraph 6.3.3 of the video MPEG2 standard) and optionally in the<br>
sequence extension (paragraph 6.3.5 of the video MPEG2 standard).<br>
These are the horizontal_size, vertical size fields and the<br>
horizontal_size_value, vertical_size_value and horizontal_size_extension,<br>
vertical_size_extension fields to which the first fields make reference. These<br>
fields in fact define the width of the displayable part of the luminance<br>
component in pels (pixels) and the height, in terms of number of lines, of the<br>
displayable part of the luminance component of the complete image (two-<br>
frame) in pels. The displayable image part, which is the image part<br>
containing the video and which does not therefore necessarily comprise an<br>
integer number of macroblocks, is aligned on the left edge and the upper<br>
edge of the coded images.<br>
The dimension of the image displayed is, for its part, defined in<br>
the sequence_display_extension (paragraph 6.3.6 of the video MPEG2<br>
standard). It will be noted that this extension does not define the display<br>
procedure. The information of this extension has no relevance to the<br>
decoding procedure and can be neglected by the decoders in accordance<br>
 with the MPEG2 specification. The two structures, display_horizontal_size<br>
and display_vertical_size, together define a rectangle which may be<br>
regarded as being the active region of the envisaged display. If this display<br>
rectangle is smaller than the coded two-frame image, then the display<br>
procedure may be expected to display only a part of this image. Conversely,<br>
 if the display rectangle is larger than the coded two-frame image, the display<br>
procedure may be expected to display the reconstructed two-frame images<br>
only on a part rather than the whole of the display device.<br>
The MPEG2 standard envisages a picture_display_extension<br>
structure, the subject of paragraph 6.3.12 of the ISO/CEI document 13818-2.<br>
The picture display extension makes it possible to offset, picture by picture,<br>
the position of the display rectangle, whose sizes are specified by the<br>
previously described "sequence_display_extension" structure. One<br>
Application relates to the reframing of images. The frame_centre_horizontal_<br>
offset and frame centre vertical offset fields indicate the horizontal and<br>
vertical offset of the centre of the reconstructed image with respect to the<br>
centre of the display, rectangle. The image centre offsets may serve to<br>
implement the full-screen reframing process, by which a rectangular zone<br>
corresponding to the full screen is defined and is shifted panoramically over<br>
the entire reconstructed image. This process is used in particular to go from<br>
an image coded in the 16/9 format to an image displayed in the 4/3 format.<br>
The zone defined by the 4/3 format can thus contain the most interesting<br>
part of the original 16/9 format image.<br>
It will be noted that the fields which are defined in the standard in<br>
respect of a sequence (sequence header, sequence display extension) may<br>
in fact be transmitted per picture (cf. reserved values in Table 6.2 of the<br>
"identification codes for extension triggering codes" standard).<br>
Amplifude of the zoom.<br>
The idea proposed here is to regard the information contained in<br>
the "display_horizontal_size" and "display_vertical_size" fields as defining the<br>
amplitude of a zoom. <br>
Instead of defining, with the aid of these fields, the dimension of<br>
the display rectangle or image displayed, as proposed by the MPEG2<br>
standard, one defines a dimension of an "initial display rectangle" or original<br>
image from which the zoom would be performed. The dimension of this initial<br>
display rectangle is such that the zoom applied to this rectangle gives an<br>
image whose dimensions are those of the target display rectangle, that is to<br>
say of the dimension of the screen, as defined by the choice of the profile<br>
and level by the coder.<br>
Thus, an initial display rectangle of dimensions greater than those<br>
of the target display rectangle corresponds to a diminution of the image and<br>
a rectangle of smaller dimensions corresponds to a magnification.<br>
The amplitude of the zoom is therefore obtained by calculating the<br>
ratio of the size of the target display rectangle, which is deduced from the<br>
level and profile information, to the size of the initial display rectangle, which<br>
is transported In the "display horizental size"- and mdisplay vertical size- fields. Of<br>
course, these latter fields should not be used for the transmission of redundant<br>
information cincerming the conversion of the 16/9 format Into the 4/3 format.<br>
An exemplary use of the fields described above Is given below and shown<br>
schematicaiy In figure 1.<br>
Let us consider a decoded or reconstructed Image referenced 1 in the figure,<br>
whose dimension is 480 pixels by 576 lines (this is in fact the dimension of the image<br>
encoded at the level of the MPEG coder), a target display rectangle or screen dimension<br>
referenced 2 of 720 pixels by 576 lines.<br>
The following table indicates that the various zoom amplitudes as a function of<br>
the information transported ti the "display horizental size" and "display vertical size"<br>
fields.<br>
The values h zooom and v_zoom correspond to the horizontal and vertical<br>
homothetles. A loom amptiude of less than 1 means that the ratios of the dimensions<br>
of the Image obtained relative to the reconstructed Image, to the respective dimensions<br>
of the coded Image, are less than 1 and a zoom ampttiude of greater than 1 Indicates<br>
that the ratios of the dimensions of the Image obtained to the respective dimensions of<br>
the coded Image are greater than 1. If this value is equal to 1, then the image obtained<br>
is the reconstructed image.<br>
Note 1: Diminution of the image<br>
Note 2: Magnification of the image<br>
Note 3: The image obtained from the coded image, the dimensions of which<br>
are greater than those of the coded image, fills the screen.<br>
The target display rectangle (or target display) deduced from the<br>
profile and level information and from the image format information (16/9) is<br>
greater than the size of the coded image.<br>
The images referenced 3, 4, 5, 6 correspond respectively to the<br>
values:<br>
h_zoom = v_zoom = 0.50<br>
h_zoom = v_zoom = 1.00<br>
h_zoom = 1.50, v_zoom = 1.00<br>
h_zoom = v_zoom = 2.00<br>
The display_horizontal_size and display_vertical_size fields are<br>
14-bit fields. The maximum decimal value, equal to 16 383, corresponds to a<br>
maximum diminution of 720/16 383 horizontally and 576/16 383 vertically, in<br>
our example.<br>
Location of the zoomed image.<br>
The frame_centre_horizontal_offset and frame_centre_vertical_<br>
offset fields of the image display extension structure are utilized to transport<br>
the zoomed image location information. Same corresponds to the offset of<br>
the centre of the coded image with respect to the centre of the initial display<br>
rectangle.<br>
The centre of the coded image (in fact of the displayable image) is<br>
the centre of the region defined by the "horizontal_size" and "vertical_size"<br>
fields of the sequence header.<br>
The centre of the initial display rectangle is the centre of the<br>
region defined by the "display_horizontal_size" and "display_vertical_size"<br>
fields, as indicated above.<br>
Figure 2 gives the example of an image diminution and represents<br>
an initial display rectangle 8 in which lies the coded image 7 corresponding<br>
to the coded image 1. The horizontal and vertical arrows depict the horizontal<br>
and vertical offset of the centre of the coded image with respect to the centre<br>
of the initial display rectangle.<br>
Let us consider for example a decoded or reconstructed image of size<br>
480 pixels x 576 lines, the "display_horizontal_size" and "display_vertical_<br>
size" fields respectively transporting the values 1 440 (pixels) and<br>
1 152 (lines) and a size of the target display rectangle of 720 (pixels) x<br>
576 (lines).<br>
h_zoom = 720 /1 440 = 0.50<br>
v_zoom = 576/1 152 = 0.50<br>
If one wishes to position a zoomed image in the upper left part of the initial<br>
display rectangle, for example at a distance of 400 pixels horizontally and<br>
300 lines vertically, from the upper left comer of the initial display rectangle,<br>
the offset information will have the following values:<br>
frame _centre Jiorizontal _offset = (400 - 1 440 / 2) x 16<br>
frame _centre _vertical _offset = (300 - 1 152 / 2) x 16<br>
The two values are negative in accordance with the MPEG norm.<br>
The values are multiplied by 16 since the offsets are specified in units of<br>
1/16th of a pel.<br>
The values 400 and 300 correspond to the pre-zoom values of the image.<br>
These values must be corrected for the zoom amplitude if one wishes to<br>
define the positioning of the zoomed image in the image actually viewed on<br>
the screen.<br>
In the case of an image magnification, the position of the initial display<br>
rectangle (8) in the coded image (7) defines the zone of the magnified coded<br>
image which one wishes to view.<br>
A particular implementation of the invention relates to the dynamic<br>
formatting of the video from an interactive application.<br>
Figure 3 represents a simplified diagram of a device for such an<br>
implementation.<br>
The various video source images are received by MPEG2 video<br>
coders 91 to 9n. The images are coded according to a constant image<br>
dimension, for example 720 pixels by 576 lines. Video syntax modification<br>
circuits 10 to 10n which are or not part of the video coders provide<br>
interfaces for modifying fields of the MPEG2 video syntax for the associated<br>
coders i to n.<br>
A toolbox for the application 12 is composed of:<br>
- an application injector, for example in the Open TV, Media<br>
Highway, Java format, these being registered trade marks, <br>
an application synchronizer which synchronizes the application<br>
with the video for the execution of this application according to the time code<br>
information of the MPEG2 elementary stream.<br>
This toolbox 12 receives information originating from the various<br>
coders i to n and transmits data for modifying the fields to the syntax<br>
modification circuits 101 to 10n.<br>
It is linked to a multiplexing circuit 11 for transmitting private data<br>
with their PID (Packet IDentifier), in the form of sections.<br>
The various coders 91 to 9n, through the video syntax modification<br>
circuits 101 to 10n as the case may be are also linked to the multiplexing<br>
circuit 11 which, on the basis of the various elementary streams and private<br>
data, provides a transport stream.<br>
This transport stream is then utilized so as to be transmitte to an<br>
IRD receiver (standing for Integrated Receiver/Decoder). This receiver, not<br>
represented in the figure, comprises, among other things, a decoder for<br>
decoding the audio/video data and an application engine for implementing<br>
the application package. It may also be a simple means of digital storage<br>
sucffas a hard disk, DVD or the like for subsequent utilization of the<br>
recorded data.<br>
The syntax modification circuit 10 modifies basic fields of the<br>
MPEG2 video syntax allowing image zooms to be carried out according to<br>
the process described above.<br>
In the video stream, these fields are modified over a time space<br>
corresponding to the duration of execution of the application. The time codes<br>
relating to the initial and final images between which the application is to be<br>
implemented at receiver level are transported by the application (private<br>
data). This is "start time code" information (tcO) and "stop time code"<br>
information (tc1) which therefore correspond to the start and to the end of<br>
the application. At the receiver, the application engine extracts the "time<br>
code" information for The various data streams and the application is<br>
triggered, for a given stream, from the reading of the time code<br>
corresponding to tcO, up to the instant tc1 where it stops. Between these two<br>
instants, the display is performed in zoom mode.<br>
The application synchronizer 12 receives the time codes of the<br>
various coders. It modifies, by way of the syntax modification circuits, the<br>
fields of the MPEG2 video syntax, between starflime code instant which<br>
corresponds to the starting of the application and stop time code instant<br>
which corresponds to the end of the application, thus making it possible to<br>
reduce (or increase) the size of the video image according to the process<br>
described above, for images lying between these instants.<br>
This "start time code" and "stop time code" info can originate from<br>
outside data. It is, for example, obtained from the identification of an image<br>
sequence during which one wishes to be able to perform a zoom, which<br>
sequence is defined by way of these time codes.<br>
In one example, the application supplements the displaying of the<br>
diminished image with a display in interactive OSD mode, by inserting<br>
information into the image. This interactive mode makes it possible to return<br>
to the normal mode, by interrupting the application.<br>
Figure 4 represents, on a first line, the image 13 as constructed by<br>
the coder between the instants tcO and to during which the application runs,<br>
as well as the images preceding the starting of the application and following<br>
the end of the application. On a second line are represented the image 14 as<br>
displayed by the decoder when the application runs, the image preceding<br>
and the image following the application.<br>
Between the instants tcO and tc1, the application, at the receiver,<br>
runs and reduces the size of the image as a function of the data read from<br>
the fields defined above.<br>
The MPEG decoder receives the data stream which it decodes in<br>
a conventional manner. In particular, the images for which a zoom operation<br>
is possible on account of the filling of the fields relating to the amplitude of<br>
the zoom and to the position of the zoomed image are decoded so as to<br>
provide firstly a reconstructed image whose size is indicated in the<br>

MPEG2 video data stream of the horizontal and vertical sizes of<br>
the initial display rectangle.</td>
