THE PATENTS ACT, 1970<br>
(39 OF 1970)<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(SECTION 10)<br>
AN IMPROVED OLEO-PNEUMATIC SHOC1<br>
VEHICLES AND THE I<br>
ENDURANCE SYSTEMS (INDIA) PRIVATE LIMITED, a Company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, of E-92, M.I.D.C Industrial Area, Waluj, Aurangabad - 431 136, in the State of Maharashtra, India.<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br>
13 DEC2004<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates synthetic detergent compositions, especially but not limited to personal wash products. In particular, the invention relates to a synthetic detergent personal wash product comprising a novel binder/structarant which effectively provides thermoplastic properties to synthetic surfactants without compromising on mildness, lather, cost etc and results in improved toilet preparations with enhanced foamability, rinsability, lather and mush.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The soaps are the oldest known surfactants and are extensively used for cleaning applications, especially body wash, personal hygiene etc. Over the last few decades the art of manufacturing personal washing bars have progressed to satisfy different, increasing needs of the consumer. Mildness is one such important need of the consumer. This is followed by improvement with respect to hardness tolerance by using synthetic surfactants.<br>
There are two broad approaches followed to make mild soap. According to the first approach common fatty acid soaps are employed as primary ingredients and mildness increased with additives and secondary surfactants.<br>
The second approach is more sophisticated as it employs major non-soap surfactants, with proven mildness to the skin.<br>
Among the several surfactants being used in detergent bars for end use in toilet bathing bar the prominent are fatty alcohol sulfate,fatty alcohol ethoxylates, fatty alcohol ether sulphate,<br>
... page 2<br><br>
linear alkyl benzene sulphonate, alkyl monoethanolamide, alkyl amidopropyl betaine, alkyl sulphosuccinates, isethionates etc.<br>
Several prior art viz. EP 363215, EP 537964, US 5296159 disclose detergent preparations comprising one or many of the above mentioned surfactants.<br>
Despite overwhelmingly better performance for	usage in	personal<br>
care, synthetic detergent or combination bar	have not	replaced<br>
soap for many reasons. Primary among them	is poor	physical<br>
characteristic of synthetic detergent bars.<br>
The alkyl isethionates, sodium fatty alcohol sulphate and alkyl sulphosuccinates are three largely used surfactant for synthetic detergents bathing preparations, alone or in combination using various process aids. Isethionates satisfy requirement of plasticity only to certain extent as compared to soaps. The above mentioned synthetic surfactants lack suitable thermoplastic properties. This limits their usage in the art of soap making as primary surfactant. Thus binders/structurants are required. The same should allow efficient bar manufacturing. In addition, the binder should impart smooth sensory properties to the composition.<br>
The following US patents teach binders and proportions thereof in mild detergent formulations involving synthetic detergents mentioned above.<br>
US 2781321 relates to a detergent bar having superior user properties and comprises as a major detergent an acyl isethionate and supplemental detergent binder and plastisizer components. The prior art discloses, as a component of the bar composition,  a  synthetic  organic  anionic  lathering  agent<br>
... page 3<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of a water soluble alkali metal and amine salts of an alkylaryl sulfonate containing at least 1 alkyl side chain radical of from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and devoid of alkyl side chain radicals of more than 6 carbon atoms and a synthetic organic anionic lathering agent selected from the group consisting of a water soluble alkali metal and amine salts of a lower alkyl ester of a lower aliphatic sulphopolycarboxyl acid containing an open chain of from 3 to 9 carbon atoms.<br>
US 2894912 relates to the production of an all purpose detergent bar or cake suitable for use in soft water, hard water and sea water. This prior art discloses, as part of detergent bar composition, at least one higher fatty acid having from about 12 to about 25 carbon atoms as binder and plasticiser.<br>
US 4234464 discloses a detergent bar binder comprising (i) fatty acid or alcohol component having an iodine number less than about 20 and a melting point of at least about 50Â°C and selected from the group consisting of fatty acids or alcohols having from 12 to 22 carbon atoms, mono-, di- or triglycerides of such fatty acids, fatty acid esters of such fatty alcohols and mixtures thereof and (ii) alkyl amide represented by a given formula. Such binder is used in a non-soap detergent bar containing anionic foaming and foam boosting detergents.<br>
US 6384000 discloses bars and process for making bars comprising synthetic anionic, fatty acid soap and hydroxy acid salt wherein bar can be extruded at minimum rates and wherein the bar and process are defined by specified ratio of hydroxy acid salt to calcite filler. The bar composition comprises (a) 10 to 50% by<br>
... page 4<br><br>
wt. anionic surfactant; (b) 5 to 30% by wt. fatty acid soap; (c) 2 to 20% hydroxy acid salt; wherein bar is extruded at rate of at least 150 grams/minute in a laboratory scale extruder; wherein the bar comprises sufficient calcite filler such that ratio of calcite filler to hydroxy acid salt is above about 0.75:1 to about 2:1; and wherein ratio of anionic to soap is greater than 1:1.<br>
Generally, an al0yl isethionate is used as primary surfactant along with some secondary surfactants. Several types of process aids and structurants/binders have been suggested along with other performance enhancing agents such as cationic polymers.<br>
Long chain fatty acids mainly stearic acid, palmitic acid, paraffin wax, cetostearyl alcohol fatty acid soap, fatty acid amide of alkanol amines are some of the binder used for this purpose, as disclosed in prior art.<br>
The known binders have several disadvantages. They depress the foamability of the detergent bar and to achieve foamability similar to fatty acid soaps and thus require more active matter and in turn more binder/structurant. Moreover, if 10% to 15% of fatty acid soaps are used as binder in such formulations, the pH of the bar increases beyond the pH range of 5.5 to 6.5, which is actual skin compatible pH range. Although the binders are added to compositions in small quantities, the products become harsh for the skin. Consequently, as a pH balancing component fatty acids have to be introduced in such formulations which can bring the pH to around 7.0. But the quantities of fatty acids so used have dampening effect on foaming and rinsability of the product. The foam dampening effect requires increased use of surfactant<br>
... page 5<br><br>
and thus the cost increases. Additionally, oily residue left on the skin due to use of fatty acids in synthetic detergent based bars give uneasy feeling to user. Possibility of getting skin pore clogs is also apprehended.<br>
In view of prior art, it will be appreciated that while making synthetic detergent bars some degree of compromise is made by using component detrimental to over all performance. For example excess of surfactant is used to overcome depression of foam /lather due to usage of binders such as fatty acid or triglyceride. Soap is used as plasticising agent, in many cases from 5 to 30% or more. Thus mildness is compromised. Soap also pushes the pH above the skin friendly pH range of 6.0 to 6.5.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
Thus the object of the present invention is to provide synthetic detergent bar compositions that have enhanced thermoplastic properties while having superior foamability. Thermoplasticity is a property of the material due to which the material can be drawn in to solid homogeneous bars of suitable shape and sizes using extrusion machines. These bars can be subsequently converted in to pieces of different shape using stamping machine. A good thermo plastic material retains homogeneity and shape on cooling, storage without deshaping or cracking after cooling or ageing.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide synthetic detergent bar compositions with no soap content, even in smaller quantities, thus avoiding harshness imparted by soap resulting in milder bath preparations.<br>
... page 6<br><br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide synthetic detergent bar compositions which do not contain fatty acids, paraffin wax, fatty alcohol.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide synthetic detergent bar compositions possessing better foamability at lower level of actives in the preparations.<br>
A yet further object of the present invention is to provide synthetic detergent bar compositions having attributes provided in the earlier objects having a pH which remains within the skin pH range of 5.5 to 6.5.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Thus according to the present invention there is provided a synthetic detergent composition comprising a binder/structurant compound of formula 1 or mixtures thereof<br>

The applicants have surprisingly found that compounds of formula 1, 2 and 3 act as an efficient binder/structurant in a detergent composition and are prepared using conventional amidification and esterification reactions. The compounds of formula 1, 2 and 3 are amide esters and are prepared using available commercial quality of alkanol amides and fatty acids. Alkanol amides may be prepared in accordance with step 1 described below or obtained from other sources. In step 2 the amide is reacted with desired fatty acid to get the amide ester compound.<br>
Step 1: Preparation of alkanol amide:<br>
In a round bottom flask, the desired fatty acid and alkanol amine is taken. The same is heated to melt with nitrogen purging. The temperature is increased to 100 degree with constant stirring and vacuum of about 100 to 300 mm of Hg. The<br>
... page 8<br><br>
temperature is increased to 120 degree centigrade. The reaction mass is digested at temperature between 120 to 200, preferably between 150 to 175 degree for several hours. The reaction is controlled by acid value analysis of the reaction mass. After getting Acid value of less than 5.0, preferably less than 3 the product is poured in to trays to get solid flakes/briquettes.<br>
Step 2: Preparation of amide ester<br>
In a round bottom flask, the fatty acid alkanol amide is taken. The same is heated to melt with nitrogen purging. The temperature is increased to 100 degree. The fatty acid is added to the molten mass with increase in temperature. With constant stirring, temperature is increased to 120 degree centigrade. The reaction mass is digested at temperature between 120 to 200, preferably between 150 to 175 degree for several hours. The reaction is controlled by acid value analysis of the reaction mass. After getting Acid value of less than 20, preferably less than 10 the product is poured in to trays to get solid flakes/briquettes. Both the steps also can be carried out simultaneously.<br>
The binder/structurant of the present invention may be used with various commercially available surfactants such as Galaxy LES 70 (sodium lauryl ether sulphate). Galaxy 100 (cocomonoethanol amide) , Galaxy 200 (lauric ethanolamide) , Galaxy LSS (lauryl sulphosuccinate) amongst others.<br>

The surfactant blends are prepared using homogeniser and extruded in noodle form. The homogenisation is carried out in a sigma mixer. If required the blend is heated while mixing the same in sigma mixer. This is followed with further homogenisation on triple roll mill and thereafter the mass is extruded into rods of suitable sizes at ambient temperatures. The extruded rods are then cut into desired length and stamped on stamping machine.<br>

Example 30<br>
Market sample of well known synthetic detergent bar Dove when<br>
evaluated shows foaming of 410 ml and mush is found to be -3.96<br>
grams per 50 cm2 area.  These values are treated as bench mark<br>
performance.<br>
Thus it is found from the above examples that the novel compound acts as an improved binder/structurant for usage in synthetic detergent bath preparations giving improved performance with respect to mushiness, foaming and rinsability. Such synthetic detergent bars can be prepared without usage of soap. Thus truly<br>
... page 19<br><br>
soapless toilet preparations can be prepared. Moreover, fatty acid, a major conventional binder used for making of synthetic detergent bar can be minimised or avoided. Reduction in use of hydrophobic binders also allows lower usage of actives. Due to high performance of the preparations more neutral structurants can be added. This translates in to cost efficient formulations. Reduced actives and skin pH range of the formulation give milder preparations.<br>
Advantages  of the invention:<br>
The main advantage of the invention is, binders are provided for milder skin friendly detergent formulation, which does not depress the foam, unlike the conventional binders used in the such formulations.<br>
The another advantage of the formulation is that since the binder does not depress the foam, one can use lower surface active content and thus make the formulation cheaper. This lower surface active substance requirement also allows one to add more non surfactant neutral fillers such as starch and talc in to the formulation making is more user friendly and economical.<br>
Another advantage of this invention is, fatty acid soap is also not required if suggested binders are used, hence the pH is more efficiently controlled. Thus apart from making the preparation cheaper, skin friendly it can allow one to have pH of the formulation in skin pH range of 5.5 to 6.5. This also means a truly soap less preparation can be made in solid form for use as toilet bath preparation. The neutral fillers not only make the formulation cheaper, but being soap less still make it more skin friendly and milder.<br>
