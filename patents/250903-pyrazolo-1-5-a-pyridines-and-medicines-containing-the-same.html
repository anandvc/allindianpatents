DESCRIPTION<br>
Pyrazolo [1, 5-a] pyridines and Medicines Containing the same.<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds having corticotropin-Releasing Factor receptor antagonistic activity, salts thereof and hydrates of the foregoing, to process for producing the same and to the use of the same as medicine.<br>
In our co-pending application no. 1748/DELNP/2003 from which this application has been divided out, we have described and claimed an invention relating to novel compounds having corticotropin-Releasing Factor receptor antagonistic activity, salts thereof and hydrates of the foregoing, to process for producing the same and to the use of the same as medicine.<br>
Background Art<br>
Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (hereinafter abbreviated as "CRF") is a neuropeptide consisting of 41 amino acids which was first isolated from ovine hypothalamus [Science, 213, 1394 (1981)], after which its presence was also confirmed in rats [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, USA, lEK), 4851 (1983)] and in humans [EMBO J. 5, 775 (1983))]. CRF is most abundant in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and is also widely distributed throughout the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and other areas of the brain. Its presence ha also been confirmed in peripheral tissue such as the placenta, adrenal gland, lung, liver, pancrea and digestive tract [J. Clin, Endocrinol. Metab., 65, 176 ((1987), J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 67, 768 (1988), Regul. Pept., 18, 173 (1987), Peptides, 5_ (Suppl.l), 71 (1984)]. Two subtype CRF receptor has been described, CRF1 and CRF2,<br><br>
and  the  CRF1  receptor  is  reported  to  be  widely distributed  in  the  cerebral  cortex,   cerebellum,<br>
olefactory bulb, pituitary gland, amuygdaloid nucleus and<br>
elsewhere.  Recently, 2 subtypes of the CRF2 receptor have been confirmed, CRF2a and CRF2(3, of which it has been discovered that CRF2a receptors are abundantly distributed in  the hypothalamus,  septal nuleus  and choroid plexus,  while CRF2f$&gt; receptors  are primarily distributed in peripheral tissue such as the skeletal muscle, or in the cerebral blood vessels of the central nervous  system  [J.  Neuroscience,  15(10)6340  (1995); Endocrinology, 137, 72 (1996); BBA, 1352, 129 (1997)]. The fact that each of these receptors has a different distribution profile suggests that their roles are also different.    CRF  is  produced  and  secreted  in  the hypothalamus  and promotes  stress-induced release  of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)  [Recent Prog. Horm. Res., 3_9, 245 (1983)].   In addition to its endocrine role,  CRF also  functions  as  a neurotransmitter  or neuromodulator     in    the    brain,     integrating electrophysiological, autonomic and behavioral changes in response to stress [Brain Res. Rev., 1_5, 71 (1990); Pharmacol. Rev., 43_, 425 (1991)].<br>
CRF has been implicated in a variety of disease to date, as indicated by the following publications.<br>
It was reported that elevated concentrations of<br><br>
CRF in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with major depression compared with healthy controls  [Am.  J<br>
psychialtry, 144(7), 873 (1087)]; CRF-mRNA levels in the<br>
hypothalamus of depressive patients are higher than that of healthy individuals [Am. J. Psychiatry,  152, 1372  (1995)]; CRF receptors in cerebral cortex are reduced in suicide victims [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 45, 577  (1988)]; plasma ACTH increase is diminished with administration of CRF to depressive patients [N. Engl. J.  Med.,  3JU,  1329  (1986)];  CRF  levels  in  the cerebrospinal  fluid of  some  anxiety patients  with obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  posttraumatic  stress disorder or Tourette' s syndrome are higher than in that of healthy individuals [Arch. Gen. Psychiatry, 5_1, 7 94 (1994);  Am.  J.  Psychiatry,  154_,  624  (1997);  Biol. Psychiatry,  3_9, 776 (1996)]; plasma ACTH increase is diminished with administration of CRF to panic disorder patients [Am. J. Psychiatry, 143, 896 (1986)]; anxiety behavior has been observed in experimental animals by central administration of CRF  [Brain Res.,  574,  7 0 (1992); J. Neurosci., 10(1), 176 (1992)].  In addition, anxiety behavior is observed more frequently in CRF overexpressing mice than in normal mice [J. Neurosci., 1_4(5),  2579  (1994)],' and CRF levels  in the  locus coeruleus are reduced by administration of anxiolytics [J. Pharmaco. Exp. Ther., 258,. 349 (1991)].  Also, the<br><br>
peptide CRF antagonist a-helical CRF(9-41) exhibits an anxiolytic effect in animal models [Brain Res., 509, 80<br><br>
Neurosci.,  1_4 (5) ,  2579  (1994)];  abnormal  behavior withdrawal from alcohol or addictive drugs such as cocaine are inhibited by the peptide CRF antagonist a-helical   CRF(9-41)   [Psychopharmacology,   103,   227 (1991)]; CRF inhibits sexual behavior in rats [Nature, 305, 232 (1983)]; CRF reduces sleep in rats and is thus implicated the involvement in sleep disorder [Pharmacol. Biochem.  Behav.,  26,  699  (1987)];  the peptide CRF antagonist a-helical CRF(9-41) suppresses brain damage or  electroencephalogram  disturbances  due  to  brain ischemia or NMDA receptor activation [Brain Res., 545, 339 (1991), Brain Res., 65JJ, 405 (1994)]; CRF elicits electroencephalogram  and  induces  convulsions  [Brain Res., 278, 332  (1983)]; cerebrospinal CRF levels are elevated  in  schizophrenic  patients  compared  with healthy individuals  [Am.  J.  Psychiatry,  144 (7),  873 (1987)]; CRF contents in cerebral cortex is reduced in Alzheimer's   patients,   Parkinson's   patients   and progressive supranuclear palsy patients [Neurology, 37, 905  (1987)];  and CRF is reduced in the ganglia in Huntington's disease  [Brain Res.,  437,  355  (1987), Neurology,  3_2,  905  (1987)].     In  addition,  CRF administration has been found to enhance learning and<br><br>
memory   in   rats   [Nature,   3_7_8,   284    (1995); Neuroendocrinology, _57_,. 1071 (1993)], and CRF levels of<br>
cerebrospinal fluid are reduced in mayotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis  patients.     Oversecretion  of  ACTH  and adrenocorticosteroids    are    exhibited    in    CRF overexpressing mice, these mice display abnormalities similar  to  Cushing's  syndrome,  including  muscular atrophy,   alopecia  and  infertility  [Endocrinology, 130(6),  3378  (1992)];  cerebrospinal  CRF levels  are elevated in anorexia nervosa patients compared with healthy individuals, and plasma ACTH increase is low with administration of CRF to anorexia nervosa patients [J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., _62_, 319 (1986)]; and CRF suppress  food  consumption  in  experimental  animals [Neuropharmacology, 22_(3A), 337 (1983)].  Moreover, the peptide CRF antagonist a-helical  CRF(9-41)  reverses stress-induced  reduction  in  food  intake  in  animal models [Brain Res. Bull., 1/7(3), 285 (1986)]; CRF has suppressed  body  weight  gain  in  genetically  obese animals [Physiol. Behav., jl5_, 565 (1989)]; a link has been  suggested between  low CRF levels  and obesity syndrome  [Endocrinology,   130,   1931   (1992)];  the anorexic action and body weight-reducing effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors has been possibly linked to CRF release [Pharmacol. Rev., _4_3, 425 (1991)]; and CRF acts centrally or peripherally to inhibit gastric<br><br>
contraction and reduce gastric emptying  [Regulatory Peptides, 2JL, 173 (1988); Am. J. Physiol., 25_3, G241<br><br>
reduced gastric function is reversed by the peptide CRF antagonist a-helical CRF(9-41)  [Am. J. Physiol., 262, G616 (1992)]; and CRF promotes secretion of bicarbonate ion in the  stomach,  thereby lowering  gastric  acid secretion and suppressing cold restraint stress ulcers [Am.   J.   Physiol.,   258_,   G152   (1990)].     Also, administration of CRF increases ulcers in non-restraint stress animals [Life Sci., 45_,  907  (1989)], and CRF suppresses small intestinal transit and promotes large intestinal transit,  and defecation is  induced.    In addition, the peptide CRF antagonist cx-helical CRF(9-41) has a inhibiting effect against restraint stress-induced gastric acid secretion reduced gastric emptying, and small  intestinal transit  and accelerated large intestinal transit [Gastroenterology, 9_5, 1510 (1988)]; psychological stress in healthy individuals increases anxiety or sensations of gas and abdominal pain during colonic  distension  and  CRF  lowers  the  discomfort threshold   [Gastroenterol.,    109,    1772    (1995); Neurogastroenterol. Mot., 8_, 9 (1996)]; irritable bowel syndrome patients experience excessive acceleration of colonic motility with CRF administration compared to healthy   individuals    [Gut,    42_,    845.   (1998)];<br><br>
administration of CRF increases blood pressure, heart rate  and body temperature,  while  the  peptide  CRF<br>
"antagonist  alpha-helical CRF(9-41) supresses stress-<br>
induces increases in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature [J. Physiol., 4_6j0, 221  (1993)]; CRF production is increased locally in inflammation sites in experimental animals and in the synovial fluid of rheumatic arthritis patients [Science, 254, 421 (1991); J. Clin. Invest., 90, 2555 (1992); J. Immunol.,  151, 1587 (1993) ] ; CRF provokes degranulation of mast cells and  promotes  vascular  permeability  [Endocrinology, 13i9(l), 403 (1998); J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 288 (3) , 1349 (1999)]; CRF is detected in autoimmune thyroiditis patients   [Am.   J.   Pathol.,   145,   1159   (1994)]; administration  of  CRF  to  experimental  autoimmune encephalomyelitis   rats   has   notably   suppressed progression of symptoms such as paralysis [J. Immumol., 158, 5751 (1997)]; and urocortin (a CRF analogue) has increased  growth  hormone  secretion  in  a  pituitary adenoma  culture  system  from  an  acromegalia  patient [Endocri.  J,  4_4,  627  (1997)].    Furthermore,  CRF simulates secretion of cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-2 by leukocytes [J. Neuroimmunol., 23, 256 (1989); Neurosci. Lett., 120, 151 (1990)]; and CRF administration and stress both suppress T lymphocyte proliferation and natural killer cell activity.   The<br><br>
peptide CRF antagonist a-helical CRF(9-41) improves the reduced function of these immune cells caused by CRF<br>
administration or stress [Endocrinology, `28(3), 1329<br>
, and ventilation is notably increased by administration of CRF [Eur. J. Pharmacol., 182, 405 (1990)]. Finally, aggravated breathing and insomnia have been observed as a result of CRF administration to elderly patients under chronic artificial respiration [Acta Endocrinol. Copenh., 127, 200 (1992)].<br>
The  research  cited  above  suggests  that  CRF antagonists  may  be  expected  to  exhibit  excellent effects for treatment or prevention of depression and depressive symptoms such as major depression,  single-episode depression,  recurrent depression,  depression-induced child abuse and postpartum depression, mania, anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, phobias,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  posttraumatic stress disorder, Tourette's syndrome, autism, affective disorder,  dysthymia,  bipolar  disorder,  cyclothymic personality, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, senile dementia of Alzheimer's type, neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, multi-infarct  dementia,   senile  dementia,   anorexia nervosa, increased appetite and other eating disorders, obesity,  diabetes,  alcohol dependence, pharmacophilia for drugs such as cocaine, -heroin or benzodiazepines,<br><br>
drug or alcohol withdrawal symptoms,  sleep disorder, insomnia,  migraine,  stress-induced  headache,  muscle<br>
concenttration induces headache, ischemic neuronal damage,	<br>
excitotoxic  neuronal  damage,   stroke,   progressive supranuclear  palsy,  amyotrophic  lateral  sclerosis, multiple sclerosis,  muscular spasm,  chronic fatigue syndrome, psychosocial dwarfism/ epilepsy, head trauma, spinal cord injury, cheirospasm, spasmodic torticollis, cervicobrachial syndrome,  primary glaucoma, Meniere's syndrome, autonomic imbalance, alopecia, neuroses such as  cardiac  neurosis,  gastric  neurosis  and bladder neurosis,  peptic  ulcer,  irritable  bowel  syndrome, ulcerative   cotis,   Crohn's   disease,   diarrhea, constipation,  postoperative  ileus,  stress-associated gastrointestinal  disorders  and  nervous  vomiting, hypertension, cardiovascular disorders such as angina pectoris nervosa, tachycardia, congestive heart failure, hyperventilation syndrome, bronchial asthma, apneusis, sudden . infant death syndrome,  inflammatory disorders (for  example,  rheumatic  arthritis,  osteoarthritis, lumbago, etc.), pain, allergosis (for example, atopic dermatitis, eczema, hives, psoriasis, etc.), impotence, menopausal    disorder,     fertilization    disorder, infertility,  cancer,  HIV  infection-related  'immune dysfunction,    stress-induced   immune   dysfunction, hemorrhagic   stress,   Cushing's   syndrome,   thyroid<br><br>
function   disorder,   encephalomyelitis,   acromegaly,<br>
incontinence, osteoporosis, and the like.  As example<br>
of CRF antagonists there hav ebeen reported peptide CRF<br>
receptor antagonists with modifications or deletions of portions of the amino acid sequence of human or other mammalian CRF, and such antagonists have shown ACTH release-inhibiting  effects  or  anxiolytic  effects<br>
[Science, 224, 889(1984), J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 269, 564 (1994), Brain Research Reviews, L5, 71 (1990)]. However, peptide derivatives have low utility value as drugs from the standpoint of pharmacokinetics including their chemical stability in the body, oral absorption, bioavailability and migration into the brain.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
As mentioned above, it is ardently desired to provide CRF receptor antagonists which are useful as drugs, but clinically effective agents that exhibit excellent CRF receptor antagonism and satisfy the requirements of pharmacological activity, dosage and safety as medicines have not yet been discovered. It is therefore an object of the present invention to investigate and discover such excellent CRF receptor antagonists. .<br>

Compounds of the present invention were evaluated in regard to Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor (CRFR)   binding  affinity  and  inhibiton  of  cAMP production.   The test methods and results were  as follows. Test Example 1 <crfr binding experiment> (1) Preparation of CRFR-expressing cells<br>
Membrane fraction of the cell highly expressing human CRFR1 was used as the experimental material for a CRFR binding experiment. The CRFR expressing cells were prepared in the following manner. The full-length CRFR1 gene was obtained from a human brain cDNA library<br><br>
(QuickClone™,  Clontech)  by PCR.    The  obtained DNA fragments were inserted into cloning vectors and the<br><br>
correct  base  sequence  was  then  relinked  to  an expression vector (pcDNA3.1™, Invitrogen).   The CRFR1 expression vector was introduced into HEK293 cells, and the  resistant  cells  which  grew  in  cell  medium containing G418  (1  mg/ml)  were cloned by  limiting dilution.   From these cloned cells, the clones with high binding affinity between the membrane fraction and sauvagine per unit of protein in the binding experiment described below were selected out and used for the final experiment. (2) Preparation of membrane fraction<br>
The cloned cells obtained in (1) were collected and disrupted with an ultrasonic generator in sonicate buffer (D-PBS(-) 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EGTA) . The suspension obtained from ultrasonic disruption was centrifuged (46,000 x g, 10 minutes), and the precipitate was resuspended in sonicate buffer and the same procedure was repeated. The final precipitate was then suspended in binding buffer (D-PBS(-) 10 mM MgCl2, 2mM EGTA, 1.5% BSA, 0.15 mM bacitracin, 1 x protease inhibitor cocktail (COMPLETE™, Boehringer)), and used as the membrane fraction after adjusting the protein concentration to 1.6 mg/ml.<br><br>
(3) Binding experiment<br>
The sauvagine binding experiment was conducted<br><br>
using a 96-well plate. The experiment was conducted according to the SPA beads instruction manual. After allowing 40 mg of the membrane fraction protein, 0.5 mg of SPA beads and 50 pM of 125I-sauvagine (Amersham Pharmacia) to stand at room temperature for 2 hours in the presence of the test compound, the mixture was centrifuged (1000 x g, 5 minutes) and the radioactivity of each well was measured with a TopCount™ (Packard) . (4) Calculation of binding affinity<br>
The radioactivity for non-radioactive sauvagine added in a 1000-fold excess was subtracted from each value   as   the   non-specific   binding,   and   the radioactivity of a sample without addition of the test substance  (control)  was defined as 100%,  with each value represented as a percentage (% of control) .   A graph was drawn with the concentration of the test substance plotted on - the  horizontal  axis  and the percentage (% of control) plotted on the vertical axis, and the concentration which resulted in a 50% value for the percentage (% of control) was determined from the graph to calculate the IC50 value. Test Example 2 <camp production inhibition experiment using att-20></camp><br>
cells&gt;<br>
(1) Test procedure<br><br>
tumor-derived cell line which is known to respond to Corticotropin-Releasing  Factor   (CRF),   leading  to activation  of  the  intracellular  adenylate  cyclase system, production of cyclic AMP (cAMP), and release of adenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH)  (Biochem.  Biophys. Res. Com. 106, 1364-1371, 1982).   For the experiment, the cells (1 x 105) were suspended in D-MEM medium (0.1% FBS) and seeded in a 96-well plate, phosphodiesterase inhibitor  (IBMX,  Calbiochem)  was  added to  a  final concentration of 1 mM, and were cultured at 37°C for 30 minutes.  A dilution of the test compound was added, culturing was continued for 30 minutes at 37°C, and CRF (30 nM) was added and culturing was continued for 30 minutes  at  37°C.    The  cells  were  collected  by centrifugatioh (500 x g,  5 minutes)  and lysed with lysis buffer (0.2% dodecyltrimethylammmonium bromide), and the intracellular cAMP production was quantified by the HTRF method.  A cAMP kit HTRF (CIS Diagnostics Co., Ltd.) was used for the cAMP quantification. (2) Calculation of cAMP production inhibition<br>
The obtained data were processed in the following manner. The cAMP production of cells to which 30 nM CRF had been added was defined as 100% (control) , and<br><br>
the  value  for each specimen was  represented as  a percentage (% of control) .  A graph was drawn with the<br>
horizontal axis and the percentage (% of control) plotted on the vertical axis, and the concentration which resulted in a 50% value for the percentage (% of control) was determined from the graph to calculate the IC50 value. <test results><br>
In Test Example 1, the compound of the invention exhibited excellent binding affinity for CRFR, with an IC50 value of 5-5000 nM. In Test Example 2, the compound of the invention exhibited excellent inhibition against CRF-dependent cAMP production. Some of the results are shown below in Table 1.<br><br><br>
