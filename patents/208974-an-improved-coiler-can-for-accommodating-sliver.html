The invention pertains to a device on a spinning can for textile fibre band, e.g. of cotton, chemical fibres or similar items, in which the spinning can has an oblong cross-section and a vertically adjustable floor element, whereby an internal lifting mechanism is allocated to the floor element.<br>
In a known device CEP 0 452 687), a lifting mechanism consists of two  compression  springs  and a  scissors  screens  which  press against  the floor element from below. During fillings the  fibre band  presses the floor element downwards- When the can is  filled with  fibre  band, both the compressor springs and  the  scissors screen  are  pressed together upto a certain height .  Thus,  the floor element cannot be lowered upto the bottom end of the  cans, whereby one  loses  can volume far the  fibre  band  filling.  A further  disadvantage is that the known device has  a  cumbersome design-It is the task of this invention to create a device of the  type already  mentioned  above,  which  would  avoid  the   mentioned disadvantages, especially allow a greater filling of the cans and have a simple design.<br>
Due to the load working from above, it is passible to lower the floor element right upto the bottom end of the cans, so that a significantly greater quantity of fibre band can be filled in-Due to the arrangement of the element at least partly above the floor element, a simple design is ensured . At the same time, the device as per the invention allows an economic manufacture of a spinning can with adjustable floor element for the fibre band.<br>
3<br><br>

The invention is explained in more details on the basis of diagram and design examples.<br>
The following are shown:<br>
Fig. 1      Schematically in side view, a rectangular can at the exit of a draw frame, Fig.2     Perspective view of a rectangular can with vertically adjustable floor element<br>
in the inner space;<br>
Fig.3a    Side view of a rectangular can with the device as per the invention; Fig.3b    Sectional depiction I - I through the design shown in fig. 3a; Fig.3c    Fastening of an end of a rubber band to a fixed bearing; Fig.4     Depiction of the compression and tensile forces acting on the adjustable floor<br>
element with filled in fibre band; Fig. 5      A design form with two tensile springs and lugs on the floor element lying<br>
outside;<br>
Fig.6      A two-part drawing element made of an elastic and a non-elastic part; Fig.7      A single-part elastic drawing element, which is executed below the floor<br>
element;<br>
Fig. 8      An endless, two-part elastic drawing element;<br>
Fig.9      A drawing element which is coiled around a coiling spool subjected to load; Fig.9a    An end region of the coiling spool with rotating spring mechanism; and Fig. 10    A deflection opening in a side wall.<br>
According to Fig. 1, round cans 1 are arranged below the feed table 2 of a draw frame, e.g. Trutzschler high performance draw frame HS, from which the feed band 3 (e.g. card sliver) is drawn off over rollers and the drafting frame 4 is guided in the direction A. After passing of the drafting frame 4, the distorted fibre band 5 lands into the revolving plate 6 of the can coiler and is deposited in rings in the rectangular can ?. The rectangular can 7 is arranged on a (not shown) driven carriage which transports the rectangular can 7 in the direction of the arrows B, C to and fro. The longitudinal direction of the rectangular can 7 is covered with the conveying mechanism B, C. By lowering the floor element 12 in the direction D (see fig. 2) one obtains a gentle depositing of the fibre band 5 in the rectangular can.<br><br>
3<br>
Fig. 2 shows the rectangular can 7, which consists of two broad side walls 7a, 7b, two thin side walls 7c, 7d and a floor wall 7e.  The length a of the side walls 7a, 7b is greater than the width b of the side walls 7c, 7d. The continuous side walls consist of two identical, bowl-shaped wall parts which are joined to one another at the points 8a and 8b.  At the upper can edge there are beads. The wall parts are, for example, made of plastic, and there could be a surrounding metallic bead 9 for joining the wall parts. The rectangular can 7 is open at the top. In the inner space 10, the rectangular floor element 12 is situated, and can be vertically adjusted in the direction of the arrows D and E.  The cross-section of the rectangular can 7 and the floor element 12 is basically rectangular shaped; the region of both the thin sides however have a rounded form adapted to the deposited fibre band rings.<br>
According to figures. 3a, 3b, as drawing elements there are four rubber bands 13a to 13d, which have one of their ends connected to the floor element 12 and the other end to a fixed bearing 14 as shown in fig. 3c.  The fixed bearings 14a to 14d are arranged on the outer surfaces of the side walls 7a and 7b. The rubber bands are guided around rounded deflection surfaces 15a to 15d in the region of the lower end of the rectangular can 7 and around the rounded bead 9 at the upper end of the rectangular can 7 and stretch above the floor element 12. In this way, elastic bands 15 are fixed on to the can walls, deflected and fastened to the floor element 12 (can floor). Thus the floor element 12 (without load from the fibre band 5) remains above in the can 7 and is moved downwards in the direction D by the filled in band 5. If one matches the expansion of the bands 15 and the weight to be supported with one another, then one can achieve a high quantity of filling. The device as per the invention on the can 7 has a simple design and the rubber bands do not involve much complication, so that the can 7 can be economically produced.<br>
According to fig. 3b, the floor area 7e reveals a small distance, e.g. 10 mm to the spinning floor. On supporting on the floor area 7e, the floor element 12 can be lowered almost completely upto the lower end of the can. The floor element 12 is made, for example, of compressed plastic and is 10 mm thick and stable.<br>
According to fig. 4, the can is half filled with (not shown) fibre band 5, i.e. the floor element is situated in the inner space 10 of the rectangular can 7 at half the height. The compression force P3 during filling in consists of the weight force (mass of the fibre band 5) and the filling force (pushing of the fibre band 5 which exits from the rotating plate 6), whereby the filling<br><br>
4<br>
force is greater than the weight force.  The compression force P3 is pitted against the tensile force of the elastic drawing elements 13', 13", which is composed of both the part drawing forces P1 andP2.<br>
In figures 5 to 9, further advantageous design forms of the invention are shown.<br>
According to fig. 5, two lugs 16', 16" at the floor element 12 pass through two vertical slots in the side walls 7c, 7d. Two tensile springs 17, 17" are fastened with one of their ends to the lugs 16' or 16" and with the other ends to be fixed bearings 18' or 18" in the region of the upper end of the rectangular can 7. Instead of tensile springs 17', 17", one can also use rubber bands or similar items.<br>
According to fig. 6, the drawing element gripping on the floor element 12 is designed as a two-part element. The non-elastic part consists of a wear-resistant, tension-resistant smooth band 20, e.g. textile band, metal band, fibre-reinforced band or any similar item, one of whose ends grips on to the floor element 12 and is deflected around the bead 9 and slides on to the bead 9.  To the other end of the band 20, a tensile spring 19 a rubber band or similar item is attached to one end, whose other end is fixed-supported.<br>
According to fig. 7, there is a single-part elastic drawing element 21, e.g. an elastic band, which is executed below the floor element 12. Due to reasons of balance and stability, ideally two of the drawing elements 21 are arranged over the long wall sides 7a, 7b. The region bearing the floor element 12 can also be designed non-elastic.<br>
According to fig. 8, there is an endless, two-part drawing element, whose one part is a non-elastic, wear-resistant band or similar item which is executed below the floor element 12, and whose both ends are fixed to an elastic drawing element, e.g. tensile spring 23, rubber band or similar item.<br>
According to fig. 9, to the floor element 12, to one of its ends a non-elastic, fixed band 24 or similar item is fastened, whose other end is attached to a fixed coiling spool 25, which can be rotated in the direction of the arrows F, G. According to fig. 9a, the coiling spool 25 is elastically loaded with a rotation spring mechanism 26 in such a way, that the band 24 exerts a tensile force P1 upwards on the floor element 12 against the compression force P3. In fig. 9<br><br>
s<br>
only one elastically loaded drawing element is shown; due to reasons of balance and stability, ideally at least two drawing elements are foreseen. The drawing element is either coilable or rollable.<br>
According to fig. 10, in the side wall 7a (and in the not shown side wall 7b) there is an opening 28 going right through, through which the drawing element can go through and thereby get deflected. The deflecting surface is ideally rounded and smooth.<br>
The schematic depiction shown in fig. 4 of the tensile and compression forces is in the same manner for the sequence of filling, e.g. at the draw frame, and the drawing off, e.g. at the OE-spinning machine of the fibre band into the or out of the spinning can 7.<br><br>
