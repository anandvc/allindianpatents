The present invention relates tc a novel pyrazole derivative, to its salts and to the solvates cne:: eor , to a process for their preparation and to pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
Patent applications EP-A-576 357, EP-A--553 546 and WO-97/19063 describe pyrazole derivatives with affinity for cannabinoid receptors. More particularly, patent appliction EP-A-656 354 describes N-piperidino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1 -(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxami.de, also known as SR 141 716, and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which have very good affinity for the central cannabinoid receptors.<br>
Compounds similar to SR  141716 have been described in the literature, in particular N-piperidino-5-(4-bromophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide, referred to hereinbelow as compound A, which is described by B.F. Thomas et al. in J. Pharm. Exp, Therap., 1998, 285, 285-292.<br>
The effects of cannabinoids are due to an interaction with specific high-affinity receptors present at the central level (Devane et al., Mol. Pharrnacol . , 1988, 34, 605-613) and at the peripheral<br><br>
level.    (Nye   *••::.   ai,,    Fharmaco 1 .    and   Exper imental   Ther., 1985,    23-1,    ..... ••••J--79L   ;   Kamnski   et   al . ,    1992,   Mel. Pharmaco ; . ,    •-.;,    736-M3   ;   Munr:   et   al . ,   Nature,    1993,<br><br><br><br><br>

N,N-dimethy1formamide) under an inert atmosphere, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent -<br>
One variant of the procedure consists in preparing the mixed anhydride of the acid of formula (II) by reacting ethyl chloroformate with the acid of formula (II), in the presence of a base such as t r i e t hyLamin e.<br>
The acid of formula (II) can be prepared according to the reaction scheme described below, in which:<br>
Li HMDS ;- lithium hexamethyldisilazi.de NBS -- N brc.mosuccinimide .<br><br>
CH   CO,Ei<br><br>
This process is characterized in that an alkyl ester, preferably the ethyl ester, of 5- !4 • -beomophenyl) - 1 -(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4 -ethylpyrazole-3-carboxylie acid is prepared by cyo i i zat: ion o : an alkyl ester, preferably the ethyl ester, of 3 (4 • bromobenzoyl)-2-(2-(2,4-dichlorcphenyl)-hycr a zono }p<rr a::o . c acioi></rr>
This reaction is carried out in a protic<br>
solvent suc?i as an alcohol, for example a C;-C<j alcohol preferably ethane. at: a temperature of between room and so in reluxing ethane .></j>
According to the invention, the alkyl estez, preferably the ethyl ester, of 3-(4-bromobenzoyl)-2-(2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)hydrazono)pentanoic acid is prepared by the action of a 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine salt, preferably the hydrochloride, on an alkyl ester, preferably the ethyl ester, of 4-bromobenzoyl-2-oxopentanoic acid (VIII).<br>
The reaction is carried out in a protic solvent, for example a Ci-C4 alcohol, preferably ethanol.<br>
According to the invention, the alkyl ester, preferably the ethyl ester, of 4-bromobenzoyl-2-oxopentanoic acid is prepared by the action of LiHMDS and then of an alkyl ester, preferably the ethyl ester, of 2 - (1 -imidazoly1) -2-oxoacetic acid on b r o m o b i j t y i o p h e n o n e .<br><br>
The reaction is carried out in an organic solvent: such as an aromatic solvent or an ether, preferably methyl tert-butyl ether. The first step of this reaction is carried out at low temperature, for example at a temperature between 0°C and -60°C, preferably at a temperature in the region of -20°C; the second :.-:. e;; is carried out at a temperature of between room temperature and -20°C, preferaDiy at room temperavure.<br>
Thus, according to Scheme 2, the preparation of an a:_kyl ester of 5- (4-bromophenyl)-!•- (2, 4-dich i orophenyl) -4 -ethy Ipyrazole- 3 -carboxylic acid (VII) is carried out starting with 4-bromobenzoyl-2-oxopentanoic acid (VIII) by the action of a 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine salt, followed by cyclization.<br>
Bromobutyrophenone is commercially available. The ethyl ester of 2-(1-imidazolyl)-<br>
2-oxoacetic acid is described and prepared according to J. Org. Chem., 1981, 4J5 (1), 211-213.<br>
The present invention also comprises a process for preparing an alkyl ester, preferably the ethyl ester, of 5-(4-bromophenyl)-<br>
1 (2 ., 4-dichiorophenyl) -4--ethyIpyrazole- 3 -carboxylic acid, from 4-bromobenzoyl-2-oxopentanoic acid, by the action of a 2,4-dichlorophenylhydrazine salt, preferably the hydrochloride, in a protic solvent, for example a C-.-C^ alcohol, preferably ethanol . The<br><br>
reaction is carried out at	a temperature of between<br>
room temperature and 80°C,	preferably in relaxing<br>

in which Alk represents a (C:-Ct) alkyl are novel and<br>
form part of. the invention. Preferably, Alk represents<br>
an ethyl.<br>
The compound of formula (I) obtained by the process according to the invention is isolated, in the<br>
form of the free base or of a salt or solvate, according to the conventional techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compound of formula (I) comprise the addition salts with acids, such as the hydrochloride, the hydrobromide, the sulphate, the hydrogen sulphate, the dihydrogen phosphate, the methanesulphonate, the methyl sulphate, t.he oxalate, the maleate, the fumarate, the<br><br>
2-naphthaLenesulphonate, the glyconate, the gluconate, the citrate, the isethionate, the para-toluenesulphonate or the succinate.<br>
The compound of formula (I) can be isolated in i:he form of one of its salts, for example the hydrochioride or the oxalate; in this case, the free base car. be prepared by neutralizing the said salt with an inorganic or organic base, such as sodium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide, triethylamine or an alkali metal carbonate or bicarbonate such as sodium or potassium carbonate or bicarbonate, and converted into another salt such as the methanesulphonate, fumarate or 2 -naphthalenesulphonate.<br>
When the compound of formula (I) is obtained in the form of the free base, the salification is carried out by treatment with the acid chosen in an organic solvent. By treating the free base, dissolved, for example, in an ether such as diethyl ether or in acetone, with a solution of the acid in the same solvent, the corresponding salt is obtained and is then isolated according to the conventional technicjues .<br>
The compounds of formula (I) have very good in vitro affinity for the CBi cannabinoid receptors, under the experimental conditions described by Devane et al - , Mol. Pharmacol., 1988, 3.4, 605-613.<br>
Thus, the compound according to the invention has very strong affinity for human CBi cannabinoid receptors (Ki = 5.4 riM) which compares favourably with<br><br>
that of SF 141716 for the same receptors, determined under the same conditions (Ki = 34 nM),<br>
'The compound according to the invention was also compared with N-piperidino-5-(4-bromophenyl)-1 - (2 , 4~u.ichi oropnenyl) - 4 -me thy Ipyrazole- 3 -carboxamide, (compound A). The affinity of this compound for human<br>
C5. eanr.aoi.-iG. •; receptors, measured under the same<br>
conditions, is reflected by a Ki value of 8 nM.<br>
Moreover, the duration of occupation of the<br>
CB: receptors present in the brain by the 3 compounds<br>
below was compared:<br>
-	the compound of formula (I) according to the<br>
invention,<br>
-	SR 141716,<br>
-	compound A.<br>
The study was performed in vivo in mice,<br>
after oral administration of each of the compounds at a dose of 10 mg/kg, according to the technique described in M. Rinaldi-Carmona et al., Life Sciences, 1995, 56, 1941-1947. The results obtained are collated in the table below<br><br>

Surprisingly, it is observed that the<br>
compound of formula (I) according to the invention is the only compound which shows appreciable occupation (44%) 24 hours after its administration.<br>
Moreover, the antagonist nature of the<br>
compound of formula (I) was demonstrated by the results obtained in models of adenylate-cyclase inhibition as described in M. Rinaldi-Carmona et al., J. Pharmacol. Exp, Ther., 1996, 278, 871-878.<br>
More particularly, the compound of the<br>
present invention, in its native form or in the form of one of its pharmaceutically acceptable salts, is a powerful, and selective antagonist of the CBi cannabinoid receptors.<br>
The antagonist nature of the compound according to the invention, as well as its good penet. rat: ion into the central nervous system, are confirmed by the results obtained in the model of<br><br>
antagonism of the hypothermia induced with a cannabinoid receptor agonist. Thus, the compound of formula (I) according to the invention antagonizes the hypothermia induced with WIN 55212-2 in mice, with an oral ED-., or: G.3 ing/kg in the Lest described by Per twee R.G. et al . in Marijuana, E[4, Ed.
