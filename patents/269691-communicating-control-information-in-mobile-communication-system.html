COMMUNICATING CONTROL INFORMATION IN MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to communicating control information in a mobile<br>
communication system. Although the present invention is suitable for a wide scope of<br>
applications, it is particularly suitable for quickly communicating new control<br>
information in a mobile communication system using an automatic repeat request<br>
scheme for indicating reception-failure of a packet. .<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a network structure of a universal mobile<br>
telecommunications system (UMTS). Referring to FIG 1, a UMTS mainly includes a<br>
user equipment (UE), a UMTS terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), and a core<br>
network (CN).<br>
The UTRAN includes at least one radio network sub-system (hereinafter<br>
abbreviated RNS). The RNS includes one radio network controller (RNC) and at least<br>
one base station (Node B) managed by the RNC. At least one or more cells exist in<br>
one Node B.<br>
FIG. 2 is an architectural diagram of a radio interface protocol between the UE<br>
(user equipment) and the UTRAN (UMTS terrestrial radio access network). Referring<br>
to FIG 2, a radio interface protocol vertically includes a physical layer, a data link layer,<br>
and a network layer. Horizontally, the radio interface protocol includes a user plane<br>
for data information transfer and a control plane for signaling transfer.<br>
The protocol layers in FIG 2 can be divided into a first layer (LI), a second layer<br>
(L2), and a third layer (L3) such as the three lower layers of an open. system<br>
interconnection (OSI) standard model widely known in the art. The respective layers<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	2	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
in FIG 2 are explained as follows.<br>
A physical layer (PHY) is the first layer and offers an information transfer service<br>
to an upper layer using a physical channel. The physical layer (PHY) is connected to a<br>
medium access control (MAC) layer located above the physical layer PHY via a<br>
transport channel. Data is transferred between the MAC layer and the PHY layer via<br>
the transport channel. Moreover, data is transferred between different physical layers,<br>
and more particularly, between a physical layer of a transmitting side and a physical<br>
layer of a receiving side via the physical channel.<br>
The MAC layer of the second layer offers a service to a radio link control (RLC)<br>
layer located above the MAC layer via a logical channel. The MAC layer can also be<br>
divided into a MAC-b sublayer, a MAC-d sublayer, a MAC-c/sh sublayer, a MAC-hs<br>
sublayer and a MAC-e sublayer according to the types of transport channels managed in<br>
detail.<br>
The MAC-b sublayer takes charge of managing a transport channel such as a<br>
broadcast channel (BCH) responsible for broadcasting system information. The MAC-<br>
c/sh sublayer manages a shared transport channel, which is shared by other UEs. A<br>
forward access channel (FACH) and a downlink shared channel (DSCH) are examples<br>
of a shared transport channel. The MAC-d sublayer takes charge of managing a<br>
dedicated transport channel such as a DCH (dedicated channel) for a specific UE. The<br>
MAC-hs sublayer manages a transport channel such as a high speed downlink shared<br>
channel (HS-DSCH) for supporting high speed data transfer in downlink and uplink.<br>
The MAC-e sublayer manages a transport channel such as an enhanced dedicated<br>
channel (E-DCH) for uplink data transfer.<br>
FIG 3 is a diagram of a structural example of DCH and E-DCH. Referring to<br>
FIG 3, both DCH and E-DCH are transport channels that can be dedicatedly used by<br>
one user equipment (UE). In particular, the E-DCH is used by a user equipment to<br>
transfer data to a UTRAN in uplink. Compared to the DCH, the E-DCH can transfer<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	3	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
uplink data faster than the DCH. To transfer data at high speed, the E-DCH adopts a<br>
technique such as hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), adaptive modulation and<br>
coding (AMC) and scheduling controlled by a Node B, for example.<br>
For E-DCH, the Node B transfers to the UE downlink control information for<br>
controlling the UE's E-DCH transfer. The downlink control information includes<br>
response information (ACK/NACK) for HARQ, channel quality information for AMC,<br>
E-DCH transport rate assignment information, E-DCH transport start time and transport<br>
time interval assignment information, and transport block size information, for example.<br>
Meanwhile, the UE transfers uplink control information to the Node B. The uplink<br>
control information includes E-DCH rate request information for Node B controlled<br>
scheduling, UE buffer status information, and UE power status information, for example.<br>
The uplink and downlink control information for E-DCH is transferred via a physical<br>
control channel such as an enhanced dedicated physical control channel (E-DPCCH).<br>
A MAC-d flow is defined between a MAC-d sublayer and a MAC-e sublayer for<br>
E-DCH. in this case, a dedicated logical channel is mapped to the MAC-d flow. The<br>
MAC-d flow is mapped to a transport channel E-DCH, and the E-DCH is mapped to<br>
another physical channel E-DPDCH (enhanced dedicated physical data channel). On<br>
the other hand, the dedicated logical channel can be directly mapped to DCH. In this<br>
case, the transport channel DCH is mapped to a dedicated physical data channel<br>
(DPDCH). The MAC-d sublayer in FIG 3 manages the DCH (dedicated channel) as a<br>
dedicated transport channel for a specific user equipment, while the MAC-e sublayer<br>
manages the E-DCH (enhanced dedicated channel) as a transport channel used in<br>
transferring fast data in uplink.<br>
A MAC-d sublayer of a transmitting side configures a MAC-d protocol data unit<br>
(PDU) from a MAC-d service data unit (SDU) delivered from an upper layer, i.e., an<br>
RLC layer. A MAC-d sublayer of a receiving side facilitates recovery of the MAC-d<br>
SDU from the MAC-d PDU received from a lower layer and delivers the recovered<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	4	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
MAC-d SDU to an upper layer. In doing so, the MAC-d exchanges the MAC-d PDU<br>
with a MAC-e sublayer via a MAC-d flow or exchanges the MAC-d PDU with a<br>
physical layer via the DCH. The MAC-d sublayer of the receiving side recovers the<br>
MAC-d PDU using a MAC-d header attached to the MAC-d PDU prior to delivering<br>
the recovered MAC-d SDU to an upper layer.<br>
A MAC-e sublayer of a transmitting side configures a MAC-e PDU from a MAC-<br>
e SDU corresponding to a MAC-d PDU delivered from an upper layer, i.e., a MAC-d<br>
sublayer. The MAC-e sublayer of a receiving side facilitates recovery of the MAC-e<br>
SDU from the MAC-e PDU received from a lower layer, i.e., a physical layer and<br>
delivers the recovered MAC-e SDU to a higher layer. In doing so, the MAC-e<br>
exchanges the MAC-e PDU with the physical layer via the E-DCH. The MAC-e<br>
sublayer of the receiving side recovers the MAC-e SDU using a MAC-e header attached<br>
to the MAC-e PDU prior to delivering the recovered MAC-e SDU to a higher layer.<br>
FIG 4 is a diagram of a protocol for E-DCH. Referring to FIG 4, a MAC-e<br>
sublayer supporting E-DCH exists below a MAC-d sublayer of a UTRAN.<br>
Furthermore, a MAC-e sublayer supporting E-DCH exists below a MAC-d sublayer of a<br>
UE. The MAC-e sublayer of the UTRAN is located at a Node B. The MAC-e<br>
sublayer exists in each UE. On the other hand, the MAC-d sublayer of the UTRAN is<br>
located at a serving radio network controller (SRNC) in charge of managing a<br>
corresponding UE. The MAC-d sublayer exists in each UE.<br>
Control information transmission for E-DCH is explained as follows. First of all,<br>
a scheduler exists at a Node B for E-DCH. The scheduler facilitates the allocation of<br>
an optimal radio resource to each UE existing within one cell to raise transmission<br>
efficiency of data in an uplink transfer at a base station from all UEs within each cell.<br>
In particular, more radio resources are allocated to a UE having a good channel status in<br>
one cell to enable the corresponding UE to transmit more data. Less radio resources<br>
are allocated to a UE having a poor channel status to prevent the corresponding UE<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	5	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
from transmitting interference signals over an uplink radio channel.<br>
When allocating radio resources to the corresponding UE, the scheduler does not<br>
only consider a radio channel status of a UE. The scheduler also requires control<br>
information from UEs. For example, the control information includes a power<br>
quantity the UE can use for E-DCH or a quantity of data the UE attempts to transmit.<br>
Namely, even if the UE has a better channel status, if there is no spare power the UE can<br>
use for E-DCH, or if there is no data the UE will transmit in an uplink direction, a radio<br>
resource should not be allocated to the UE. In other words, the scheduler can raise the<br>
efficiency of radio resource use within one cell only if a radio resource is allocated to a<br>
UE having a spare power for E-DCH and data to he transmitted in the uplink transfer.<br>
Accordingly, a UE should send control information to a scheduler of a Node B.<br>
The control information can be transmitted in various ways. For instance, a scheduler<br>
of a Node B can instruct a UE to report that data to be transmitted in uplink exceeds a<br>
specific value or to periodically send control information to the Node B itself.<br>
In case a radio resource is allocated to a UE from a scheduler of a Node B, the UE<br>
configures a MAC-e PDU within the allocated radio resource and then transmits the<br>
MAC-e PDU to a base station via E-DCH. In particular, if there exists data to be<br>
transmitted,- a UE sends control infoimation.to a Node B to inform the Node-b that there<br>
is data to be transmitted by the UE. A scheduler of the Node B then sends information<br>
indicating that a radio resource allocation will be made to the UE based on Hie control<br>
information been sent by the UE. In this case, the information indicating the radio<br>
resource allocation means a maximum value of power the UE can transmit in uplink, a<br>
ratio for a reference channel, etc. The UE configures the MAC-e PDU within a<br>
permitted range based on the information indicating the radio resource allocation and<br>
transmits the configured MAC-e PDU.<br>
However, in the related art method, a UE transmits a MAC-e PDU, which starts a<br>
transmission, until receiving an acknowledgement (ACK) from the Node B that the<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	.	6	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
MAC-e PDU was correctly received by the Node B, or retransmits the MAC-e PDU as<br>
many times as a maximum retransmission attempt value allows. Accordingly, when<br>
new data arrives at the UE to be transmitted to the Node B, new control information<br>
should also be transmitted to the Node B to request a resource allocation for the new<br>
data transmission. However, in the related art as shown in FIG 5, the UE must wait<br>
until receiving an ACK from the Node B or retransmit an old MAC-e PDU a maximum<br>
number of times allowable before transmitting a new or updated MAC-e PDU with the<br>
new control information. Accordingly, a time taken for a UE to receive a radio<br>
resource allocation is delayed. Furthermore, by considering that information such as<br>
power information is frequently changed, wrong or old information is delivered to a<br>
Node B under the related art method.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to communicating control information in a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
A transmission method using a hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	11	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
will be explained as follows. First of all, HARQ is used for E-DCH to raise a<br>
probability of transmitted data successfully arriving at a receiving side and to reduce the<br>
power necessary for the corresponding arrival. Accordingly, under HARQ, raising the<br>
probability of transmission success and reducing necessary power is dependent on<br>
feedback information sent from the receiving side to a transmitting side. Preferably,<br>
the feedback information notifies the transmitting side whether the data transmitted by<br>
the transmitting side is correctly received at the receiving side.<br>
For instance, if a receiving side correctly receives a packet 1 transmitted by a<br>
transmitting side, such as a UE, via a physical channel, the receiving side transmits a<br>
reception success signal or acknowledgement (ACK). If the receiving side fails to<br>
correctly receive the packet 1, the receiving side transmits a negative acknowledgement<br>
(NACK). Thereafter, the transmitting side transmits new data, i.e., a packet 2 in case<br>
that the feedback is ACK with reference to the feedback-having been transmitted by the<br>
transmitting side. If the feedback is NACK, the transmitting side retransmits the<br>
packet 1. In doing so, the transmitting side attempts a transmission using both of the<br>
former packet 1 (firstly transmitted) and the latter packet 1 (secondly transmitted). If<br>
this succeeds, the receiving side transmits ACK to the transmitting side. If this fails,<br>
the receiving side transmits NACK to the transmitting side. When NACK is received<br>
the transmitting side, the transmitting side repeats the above process. In this case, the<br>
retransmitted packet 1 should be identical to the former packet 1. If not, the receiving<br><br>
WO2006/118428	12	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
side is unable to recover the data correctly.<br>
However, if the UE continues to stay in an area having a poor channel status or if<br>
data to be transmitted by the UE is sensitive to delivery delay, the UE is unable to<br>
indefinitely perform the above-explained retransmission. Therefore, the receiving side<br>
informs a UE of a maximum number of available transmissions or retransmissions. In<br>
case of receiving the NACK from the receiving side after having attempted to transmit<br>
data as many times as the maximum number of retransmissions, the UE stops<br>
attempting the transmission of the corresponding data and attempts a transmission of<br>
next data.<br>
Hence, even if control information is included in the MAC-e PDU, the UE<br>
attempts retransmission of the MAC-e PDU as many times as the maximum number of<br>
retransmissions. As previously mentioned, the above-explained retransmission is<br>
needed to raise the probability of reception success of the MAC-e PDU in the receiving<br>
side. Preferably, contents included in the control information are a maximum priority<br>
channel, a maximum priority channel ratio, a total buffer quantity, a margin of power<br>
and the like. In this case, the maximum priority channel means a channel having a<br>
highest priority among channels having data to be transmitted.<br>
As mentioned in the foregoing description, in the HARQ system, a transmitting<br>
side transmits data, waits for a feedback from a receiving side and then decides whether<br>
to perform a retransmission according to the contents of the feedback. However, a<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	13	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
long time elapses until a response from the receiving side arrives at the transmitting side<br>
after the data is transmitted by the transmitting side. While awaiting the response, the<br>
UE may receive various new data from a user, in such a case, the maximum priority<br>
channel may be changed, or other information such as the total buffer quantity, the<br>
margin of power and the like may be changed as well.<br>
In particular, the maximum priority channel information is important. This is<br>
because a Node B preferentially allocates radio resources to UEs having higher<br>
priorities when considering all UEs within a corresponding cell during the allocation of<br>
radio resources. Accordingly, if a maximum priority channel included in the control<br>
information firstly transmitted by a UE is a channel having a very low priority, and if<br>
data later arrives at the UE from a channel having a higher priority, the UE should<br>
inform the Node B of this information immediately. For example, the UE may inform<br>
the Node B at a time when the UE receives NACK from the Node B.<br>
FIG 6A illustrates a method for communicating control information in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG 6A, a<br>
first data packet (MAC-e PDU 1) comprising first control information for first data is<br>
transmitted from a UE to a receiving side, wherein the receiving side may be a network<br>
or a mobile terminal, for example. Preferably, the first control information requests a<br>
resource allocation for the transmission of the first data. Subsequently, new data<br>
arrives at the UE to be transmitted to the receiving side. In order to transmit the new<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	14	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
data, the UE requests a data transmission resource allocation from the receiving side by<br>
transmitting control information related to the new data (new control information) to the<br>
receiving side via a new or updated data packet (MAC-e PDU 2).<br>
As shown in FIG 6A, the UE preferably does not wait until receiving an ACK<br>
from the receiving side for the first data packet, or until the maximum number of first<br>
data packet retransmissions is attained prior to transmitting the new control information<br>
to the receiving side. Rather, the UE waits to receive a NACK for the first data packet<br>
Upon receiving the NACK, the UE configures a new data packet or updates the first<br>
data packet to include the new control information. Thereafter, the new or updated<br>
data packet is transmitted to the receiving side.<br>
FIG 6B illustrates a method for communicating control information in<br>
accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG 6B,<br>
new data to be transmitted arrives at the UE at a time when a NACK is received from a<br>
receiving side for a first data packet transmission. When the NACK is received, the<br>
UE configures a new data packet or updates the first data packet to include new control<br>
information related to the new data. Thereafter, the new or updated data packet is<br>
transmitted to the receiving side.<br>
FIG 7 illustrates a method for communicating control information in accordance<br>
with another embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIG 7, the UE does<br>
not wait to receive any feedback information from the receiving side for a previously-<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	15.	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
transmitted data packet prior to transmitting new control information. Thus, once new<br>
data arrives at the UE to be transmitted to the receiving side, the UE immediately<br>
configures a new data packet comprising new control information related to the new<br>
data for requesting a data transmission resource allocation. Once configured, the new<br>
data packet is transmitted to the receiving side independent of receiving feedback<br>
information for the previously-transmitted data packet.<br>
Hence, the present invention enables a UE using E-DCH to receive a service of<br>
proper quality. For this, the present invention discloses a method of enabling a UE to<br>
transmit control information to a base station effectively. Preferably, if the contents of<br>
the control information to be transmitted are changed while a UE performs HARQ<br>
retransmission, new control information of the UE is transmitted to the Node B.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, when a UE<br>
transmits a MAC-e PDU containing control information to a base station (Node B) and<br>
waits for a response (feedback information) from the base station for the MAC-e PDU,<br>
if the response instructs that the UE should retransmit the MAC-e PDU, the UE stops a<br>
retransmission of the MAC-e PDU, re-configures the MAC-e PDU with the latest<br>
control information to be transmitted, and transmits the re-configured MAC-e PDU. If<br>
control information is included in the MAC-e PDU only and if control information of<br>
the UE is changed while the UE receives the corresponding response, the UE stops a<br>
retransmission of the MAC-e PDU, re-configures the MAC-e PDU with the latest<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	16	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
control information to be transmitted, and then transmits the re-configured MAC-e PDU.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the UE includes<br>
control information in a MAC-e PDU and transmits the MAC-e PDU to a base station.<br>
The UE then waits for a response (feedback information) from the base station for the<br>
MAC-e PDU. If the UE receives a command instructing the UE to retransmit the<br>
MAC-e PDU, and if the MAC-e PDU includes only the control information, and if the<br>
control information of the UE is changed while the UE having transmitted the MAC-e<br>
PDU receives a corresponding response, the UE can ignore a maximum number of<br>
retransmissions.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, when a UE<br>
transmits a MAC-e PDU containing control information to a base station, if the MAC-e<br>
PDU includes only the control information, the present invention discloses that a<br>
maximum number of retransmissions of the MAC-e PDU is construed as zero.<br>
Preferably, the UE decides not to perform the retransmission when the MAC-e PDU<br>
includes only the control information. When receiving a response indicating that a<br>
reception of the MAC-e PDU including only the control information fails, the UE<br>
ignores the previous MAC-e PDU, configures a MAC-e PDU by updating the control<br>
information and transmits the configured MAC-e PDU. The UE attempts this process<br>
until receiving a response indicating a successful reception of the MAC-e PDU and<br>
continues performing this process until a number of retransmissions does not exceed a<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	17	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
maximum number of retransmissions. Notably, if an initial MAC-e PDU transmission<br>
is included in the retransmission number in this process, the UE may construe the<br>
maximum number of retransmissions as 1.<br>
Preferably, the control information described above comprises scheduling<br>
information such as a UE's marginal power quantity (mobile terminal power headroom),<br>
a total quantity of data possessed by the UE (total E-DCH buffer status), a channel<br>
having a highest priority among channels having data to be transmitted (highest priority<br>
logical channel identifier), or a ratio of data quantity corresponding to a channel having<br>
a highest priority over total data.<br>
in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, when the UE<br>
receives a response instructing that a retransmission is necessary after having<br>
transmitted a MAC-e PDU including only control information, and if data arrives at a<br>
channel having a priority higher than that of a channel having a highest -priority<br>
instructed by the control information, the UE stops a retransmission of the MAC-e PDU,<br>
includes updated control information in a new MAC-e PDU and transmits the new<br>
MAC-e PDU to the base station.<br>
Preferably, after the UE has transmitted the MAC-e PDU including the control<br>
information only, if the UE receives a response requesting a retransmission of the MAC-<br>
e PDU, and if the control information the UE is to transmit is to be updated, and if a<br>
number of retransmissions is smaller than a maximum number of retransmissions, the<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	18	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
UE retransmits the previously transmitted MAC-e PDU. Otherwise, the UE stops the<br>
retransmission.<br>
Preferably, the response requesting the retransmission comprises a signal<br>
indicating that a receiving side fails to receive data from a transmitting side correctly.<br>
A NACK signal is an example of such a signal. Preferably, if another user data is<br>
included in the UE-transmitting MAC-ePDU including the control information, the UE<br>
continues to perform the retransmission for the previous MAC-e PDU.<br>
Preferably, if a channel status is poor, the UE preferably continues to transmit the<br>
previously transmitted MAC-e PDU for a more concrete reception at a Node B. For<br>
this, if the control information is changed for the MAC-e PDU containing the control<br>
information only, the UTRAN informs the UE whether to keep performing the<br>
retransmission of the previous MAC-e PDU or to configure and send a new MAC-e<br>
PDU with the latest control information. Accordingly, this may be accomplished<br>
utilizing a setup indicator.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention enables new control information to be quickly<br>
transmitted to a base station in a mobile communication system utilizing an automatic<br>
repeat request scheme.<br>
Referring to FIG 8, a block diagram of a mobile communication device 400 of<br>
the present invention is illustrated, for example a mobile phone for performing the<br>
methods of the present invention. The mobile communication device 400 includes a<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	19	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
processing unit 410 such as a microprocessor or digital signal processor, an RF module<br>
435, a power management module 406, an antenna 440, a battery 455, a display 415, a<br>
keypad 420, a storage unit 430 such as flash memory, ROM or SRAM, a speaker 445<br>
and a microphone 450.<br>
A user enters instructional information, such as a telephone number, for example,<br>
by pushing the buttons of a keypad 420 or by voice activation using the microphone 450.<br>
The processing unit 410 receives and processes the instructional information to perform<br>
the appropriate function, such as to dial the telephone number. Operational data may<br>
be retrieved from the storage unit 430 to perform the function. Furthermore, the<br>
processing unit 410 may display the instructional and operational information on the<br>
display 415 for the user's reference and convenience.<br>
The processing unit 410 issues instructional information to the RF module 435 to<br>
initiate communication, for example, transmits radio signals comprising voice-<br>
communication data. The RF module 435 comprises a receiver and a transmitter to<br>
receive and transmit radio signals. The antenna 440 facilitates the transmission and<br>
reception of radio signals. Upon receiving radio signals, the RF module 435 may<br>
forward and convert the signals to baseband frequency for processing by the processing<br>
unit 410. The processed signals would be transformed into audible or readable<br>
information outputted via the speaker 445, for example.<br>
The processing unit 410 is adapted to receive first and second data from an upper<br><br>
WO 2006/118428	20	PCT/KR2006/001676<br>
layer and generate a first and second data block comprising information related to the<br>
first and second data to be transmitted to a network. The processing unit 410 is also<br>
adapted to control a transmitter of the RF module 435 to transmit the first and second<br>
data block to the network. A receiver of the RF module 435 is adapted to receive<br>
signals from the network.<br>
