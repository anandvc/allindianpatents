				<td>PYRIDO[2,3-d]PYRIMIDINES USEFUL AS HCV INHIBITORS, AND METHODS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
The present invention relates to the use of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines as inhibitors of HCV replication as well as their use in pharmaceutical compositions aimed to treat or combat HCV infections. In addition, the present invention relates to compounds per se. The present invention also concerns processes for the preparation of such compounds, pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and combinations of said compounds with other anti-HCV agents.<br>
Following its discovery in 1989 as the agent implicated in the majority of viral non-A, non-B hepatitis (Choo et al, Science 244, 359-362,1989), hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become a focus of considerable medical research (Lauer, G.M and Walker, B.D., New Eng. JMed. 345,41-52,2001). HCV is a member of the Flaviviridae femily of viruses in the hepacivints genus, and is closely related to the flavivirus genus, which includes a number of viruses implicated hi human disease, such as dengue virus and yellow fever virus, and to the animal pestivirus family, which includes bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). HCV is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus, with a genome of around 9,600 bases. The genome comprises both 5' and 3' untranslated regions which adopt RNA secondary structures, and a central open reading frame that encodes a single polyprotein of around 3,010-3,030 amino acids. The polyprotein encodes ten gene products which are generated from the precursor polyprotein by an orchestrated series of co- and posttranslational endoproteolytic cleavages mediated by both host and viral proteases. The viral structural proteins include the core nucleocapsid protein, and two envelope glycoproteins El and E2. The non-structural (NS) proteins encode some essential viral enzymatic functions (helicase, polymerase, protease), as well as proteins of unknown function. Replication of the viral genome is mediated by an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, encoded by non-structural protein 5b (NS5B). In addition to the polymerase, the viral helicase and protease functions, both encoded in the bifunctional NS3 protein, have been shown to be essential for replication of HCV RNA hi chimpanzee models of infection (Kolykhalov, A. A., Mihalik, K., Feinstone, S.M., and Rice, C.M. J Virol. 74,2046-2051, 2000). In addition to the NS3 serine protease, HCV also encodes a metalloproteinase in the NS2 region.<br>
HCV replicates preferentially in hepatocytes but is not directly cytopathic, leading to persistent infection. In particular, the lack of a vigorous T-lymphocyte response and the high propensity of the virus to mutate appear to promote a high rate of chronic<br>
infection. There are 6 major HCV genotypes and more than 50 subtypes, which are differently distributed geographically. HCV type 1 is the predominant genotype in the US and Europe. For instance, HCV type 1 accounts for 70 to 75 percent of all HCV infections in the United States. The extensive genetic heterogeneity of HCV has important diagnostic and clinical implications, perhaps explaining difficulties in vaccine development and the lack of response to therapy. An estimated 170 million persons worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Following the initial acute infection, a majority of infected individuals develop chronic hepatitis, which can progress to liver fibrosis leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) (National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement: Management of Hepatitis C. Hepatology, 36, 5 Suppl. S3-S20, 2002). Liver cirrhosis due to HCV infection is responsible for about 10,000 deaths per year hi the U.S.A. alone, and is the leading cause for liver transplantations. Transmission of HCV can occur through contact with contaminated blood or blood products, for example following blood transfusion or intravenous drug use. The introduction of diagnostic tests used in blood screening has led to a downward trend in post-transfusion HCV incidence. However, given the slow progression to the end-stage liver disease, the existing infections will continue to present a serious medical and economic burden for decades (Kim, W.R. Hepatology, 36, 5 Suppl. S30-S34,2002).<br>
The treatment of this chronic disease is an unmet clinical need, since current therapy is only partially effective and limited by undesirable side effects.<br>
Current HCV therapies are based on (pegylated) interferon-alpha (IFN-Î±) in combination with ribavirin. This combination therapy yields a sustained virologic response in more than 40% of patients infected by genotype 1 viruses and about 80% of those iniected by genotypes 2 and 3. Beside the limited efficacy on HCV type 1, combination therapy has significant side effects and is poorly tolerated in many patients. For instance, in registration trials of pegylated interferon and ribavirin, significant side effects resulted in discontinuation of treatment in approximately 10 to 14 percent of patients. Major side effects of combination therapy include influenza-like symptoms, hematologic abnormalities, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The development of more effective, convenient and tolerated treatments is a major public health objective.<br>
Thus, there is a high medical need for low molecular weight compounds that lead to an inhibition of HCV replication.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that derivatives of pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines exhibit antiviral activity in mammals infected with HCV, in particular these derivatives inhibit HCV replication. These compounds are therefore useful in treating or combating HCV infections in mammals.<br>
US2004/0038856 describes quinazoline derivatives that are inhibitors of TOFÃ-Rl receptor kinase and TGF-Ã mediated signaling. WOOO/12497 describes as well quinazoline derivatives that are inhibitors of TGF-P and/or p38-Î± kinase.<br>
In addition, WO04/020584 describes compounds which are antagonists of chemokine receptor activity, and methods of making such compounds. Said patent publication also encompasses pharmaceutical compositions containing those compounds. Further methods are provided for the treatment of CCR4 chemokine receptor associated disorders and the treatment or prevention of asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, solid organ transplant rejection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br>
WO2003059913 describes roh-kinase inhibitors, derivatives thereof, and the synthesis thereof. Said compounds are useful for inhibiting tumor growth, treating erectile dysfunction, and treating other indications mediated by Rho-kinase, e.g., coronary heart disease.<br>
JP2003321472 discloses GRK inhibitors useful for the prevention and remedy of cardiac failure.<br>
Furthermore, WO95/19774 describes bicyclic heteroaromatic compounds which inhibit the epidermal growth factor receptor and related receptors and, in particular, their tyrosine kinase enzymic activity. Said compounds are useful in suppressing tumors, especially breast cancers, where mitogenesis is heavily driven by EGFR family members. In addition, said compounds have utility as therapeutic agents against proliferative overgrowth diseases, including but not limited to, synovial pannus invasion in arthritis, vascular restenosis, psoriasis and angiogenesis. The compounds disclosed therein also are useful to treat pancreatitis and kidney disease and as a contraceptive agent.<br>
US3873545 discloses substituted derivatives of pyrido[2,3d]pyrimidine, which are particularly useful as neuroleptic and tranquillizing agents.<br>
Osselaere et al. (1973,1974) describe pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives, in particular 4-amino-2-arylpyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives having anti-inflammatory and spasmolytic properties.<br>
After initial exposure to the Hepatitis C virus, HCV RNA can be detected in blood in 1-3 weeks. Within an average of 50 days virtually all patients develop liver cell injury. The majority of patients are asymptomatic and anicteric. Only 25-35 percent develop malaise, weakness, or anorexia, and some become icteric. Antibodies to HCV (anti-HCV) almost invariably become detectable during the course of illness. Anti-HCV can be detected in 50-70 percent of patients at the onset of symptoms and in approximately 90 percent of patients 3 months after onset of infection. HCV infection is self-limited in only 15 percent of cases. Recovery is characterized by disappearance of HCV RNA from blood and return of liver enzymes to normal.<br>
About 85 percent of HCV-infected individuals fail to clear the virus by 6 months and develop chronic hepatitis with persistent, although sometimes intermittent, viremia. This capacity to produce chronic hepatitis is one of the most striking features of HCV infection. Chronic hepatitis C is typically an insidious process, progressing, if at all, at a slow rate without symptoms or physical signs in the majority of patients during the first two decades after infection. Symptoms first appear in many patients with chronic hepatitis C at the time of development of advanced liver disease.<br>
In chronic hepatitis, inflammatory cells infiltrate the portal tracts and may also collect in small clusters in the parenchyma. The latter instance is usually accompanied by focal liver cell necrosis. The margin of the parenchyma and portal tracts may become inflamed, with liver cell necrosis at this site (interface hepatitis). If and when the disease progresses, the inflammation and liver cell death may lead to fibrosis. Mild fibrosis is confined to the portal tracts and immediately adjacent parenchyma. More severe fibrosis leads to bridging between portal tracts and between portal tracts and hepatic veins. Such fibrosis can progress to cirrhosis, defined as a state of diffuse fibrosis in which fibrous septae separate clusters of liver cells into nodules. The extent of fibrosis determines the stage of disease and can be reliably assessed Severe fibrosis and necroinflammatory changes predict progression to cirrhosis. Once cirrhosis is established, complications can ensue that are secondary to liver failure and/or to portal hypertension, such as jaundice, ascites, variceal hemorrhage, and encephalopathy. The development of any of these complications marks the transition from a compensated to a decompensated cirrhosis.<br>
Chronic hepatitis C infection leads to cirrhosis in at least 20 percent of patients within 2 decades of the onset of infection. Cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease may occasionally develop rapidly, especially among patients with concomitant alcohol use. Chronic infection by HCV is associated with an increased risk of liver cancer. The prevailing concept is that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurs against a background of inflammation and regeneration associated with chronic hepatitis over the course of approximately 3 or more decades. Most cases of HCV-related HCC occur in the presence of cirrhosis.<br>
Liver fibrosis is one of the processes that occurs when the liver is damaged. Such damage may be the result of viral activity (e.g., chronic hepatitis types B or C) or other liver infections (e.g., parasites, bacteria); chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals, recreational drugs, excessive alcohol, exposure to pollutants); immune processes (e.g., autoimmune hepatitis); metabolic disorders (e.g., lipid, glycogen, or metal storage disorders); or cancer growth (primary or secondary liver cancer). Fibrosis is both a sign of liver damage and a potential contributor to liver failure via progressive cirrhosis of the liver.<br>
It has been disclosed that the inhibition of the family TGFp kinases is useful in the treatment of fibroproliferative disorders, including liver fibrosis. However, as it is noted above, liver fibrosis may be caused by different ethiological agents, including the Hepatitis C virus. Most importantly, liver fibrosis is a specific condition in the disease progression of patients infected with HCV.<br>
It has been surprisingly found that the compounds of the present invention inhibit HCV replication. HCV replication refers to the process of reproducing or making copies of HCV RNA. In the present invention HCV replication both refers to the replication of the HCV virus as a whole or the replication of the HCV RNA genome.<br>
It is important to treat HCV infected patients at early stages in order to avoid disease progression, thereby avoiding that the patient develops chronic hepatitis, liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or death.<br>
The compounds of the invention are valuable in that they may diminish the HCV viral load of a patient to undetected levels.<br>

The term stereochemically isomeric forms of compounds of the present invention, as used hereinbefore, defines all possible compounds made up of the same atoms bonded by the same sequence of bonds but having different three-dimensional structures which are not interchangeable, which the compounds of the present invention may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of a compound encompasses the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms which said compound may possess. Said mixture may contain all diastereomers and/or enantiomers of the basic molecular structure of said compound. All stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of the present invention both in pure form or in<br>
admixture with each other are intended to be embraced within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates as mentioned herein are defined as isomers substantially free of other enantiomeric or diastereomeric forms of the same basic molecular structure of said compounds or intermediates. In particular, the term 'stereoisomerically pure1 concerns compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of at least 80% (i. e. minimum 90% of one isomer and maximum 10% of the other possible isomers) up to a stereoisomeric excess of 100% (i.e. 100% of one isomer and none of the other), more in particular, compounds or intermediates having a stereoisomeric excess of 90% up to 100%, even more in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 94% up to 100% and most in particular having a stereoisomeric excess of 97% up to 100%. The terms 'enantiomerically pure' and 'diastereomerically pure' should be understood in a similar way, but then having regard to the enantiomeric excess, respectively the diastereomeric excess of the mixture in question.<br>
Pure stereoisomeric forms of the compounds and intermediates of this invention may be obtained by the application of art-known procedures. For instance, enantiomers may be separated from each other by the selective crystallization of their diastereomeric salts with optically active acids or bases. Examples thereof are tartaric acid, dibenzoyl-tartaric acid, ditoluoyltartaric acid and camphpsulfonic acid. Alternatively, enantiomers may be separated by chromatographic techniques using chiral stationary phases. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably, if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The diastereomeric racemates of formulae (I), (II), (III), (IV), or (V) can be obtained separately by conventional methods. Appropriate physical separation methods that may advantageously be employed are, for example, selective crystallization and chromatography, e.g. column chromatography.The present compounds may also exist in their tautomeric forms. Such forms, although not explicitly indicated in the above formula are intended to be included within the scope of the present invention. For example, within the definition of Het2, for example an 1,2,4-oxadiazole may be substituted with a hydroxy or a mercapto group in the    .<br>
5-position, thus being in equilibrium with its respective tautomeric form as depicted below.<br>

A number of synthetic routes may be employed to produce the compounds of the invention. In general, they may be synthesized using reactions known in the art Any art-known method for synthesis may be employed. However, the following synthetic routes are convenient for preparation of the invention compounds.<br>
The compounds of the formula (V) may be synthesized following a procedure adapted from Wamhoff, H.; Kroth, E. Synthesis, 1994,405-410 as described in Scheme 1.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Basically, a methyl 2-amino-3-pyridinecarboxylate (la) is reacted with acylchloride in the presence of a suitable solvent such as chloroform or pyridine to afford 2-acylaminopyridin-3-carboxylates (Ib). Said 2-acylaminopyridin-3-carboxylates (Ib) are converted with for example ammonium hydroxide into 2-acylaminopyridin-3-amides (1d). Optionally, 2-acylaminopyridin-3-amides (Id) may already be obtained by acylation of a 2-arnino-3-pyridineamide (Ic).<br>
The 2-acylaminopyridin-3-amides (1d) are then cyclized by the addition of a base to form pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-ol derivates of formula (le). The alcohol may then be replaced by a halogen with the help of a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride in a suitable solvent like chloroform, dichloroethane or tetrahydrofuran (THF) in presence of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide (DMF). Following, a nucleophilic substitution is performed on compound (1f) with an amine or an alcohol of formula HLR2, together with a suitable base, such as TEA or DIPEA in an organic solvent such as DCM, THF or DMF, yielding compound (1g).<br>
Alternatively, the 2-acylaminopyridin-3-amides maybe converted in a one-pot procedure into the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines of formula (V) by reacting compound of formula (le) with an amine or alcohol of the formula HLR2 together with a suitable base, such as TEA or DEPEA in the presence of benzotriazole-1-yl-oxy-tris-pyrrolidino-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBOP). In the formula HLR2, H is hydrogen, and L and R2 have the meanings indicated above hi the definition of the substituents of compound of formula (V).<br>
Scheme 2<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the formula (V) can be prepared from the<br>
corresponding pyridopyrimidinone derivates as starting materials followed by their<br><br>
conversion to the iminochlorides and the subsequent displacement of the chlorine atom with an appropriate amine such as a 4-aminopyridine as shown below in Scheme 2. (Scheme Removed) <br><br>
(i) thionyl chloride, DMF; (ii) 4-aminonicotinic acid methyl ester, TEA; (iii) NaOH; (iv) PyBOP, TEA, HNR4aR4b.<br>
Schemes 3 and 4, shown below, provide alternative routes to the pyridyl nucleus and fiirther substitution thereof.<br>
Scheme 3(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 4(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 1 shows how a 4-hydroxy pyrimidine can be converted into a 4-halo pyrimidine, which is then coupled to a 4-aminopyridine. The coupling is done using a<br>
palladium catalyst, and may be done with the 4-chloropyrimidine derivative in some cases, but was done with the 4-iodo derivative in some cases.<br>
The requisite 3-carboxamide group may be present on the 4-aminopyridine when the pyridine is added to the pyrimidine, or the pyridyl group may contain an ester at the 3-position as illustrated in Scheme 5. In that case, the ester can be hydrolyzed with base to form a carboxylic acid after the pyridine group is installed. This carboxylic acid is readily coupled to a wide variety of amine groups by methods well known in the art for forming amide bonds as illustrated in Scheme 2. Because of the wide variety of amines that are available and the generality of this amide formation reaction, this method provides access to a tremendous variety of compounds of the present invention.<br>

It will be appreciated by the person skilled in the art that the compounds of formula (V) may be tested in a cellular HCV replicon system based on Lohmann et al. (1999) Science 285:110-113, with the flirther modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624 (incorporated herein by reference), which is further exemplified in the examples section. This model, while not a complete infection model for HCV, is widely accepted as the most robust and efficient model of autonomous HCV RNA replication currently available. Compounds exhibiting anti-HCV activity in<br>
this cellular model are considered as candidates for further development in the treatment of HCV infections in mammals. It will be appreciated that it is important to distinguish between compounds that specifically interfere with HCV functions from those that exert cytotoxic or cytostatic effects in the HCV replicon model, and as a consequence cause a decrease in HCV RNA or linked reporter enzyme concentration. Assays are known in the field for the evaluation of cellular cytotoxicity based for example on the activity of mitochondrial enzymes using fluorogenic redox dyes such as resazurin. Furthermore, cellular counter screens exist for the evaluation of non-selective inhibition of linked reporter gene activity, such as firefly luciferase. Appropriate cell types can be equipped by stable transfection with a luciferase reporter gene whose expression is dependent on a constitutively active gene promoter, and such cells can be used as a counter-screen to eliminate non-selective inhibitors.<br>

Activity of compounds of formula (V) in HCV replicon assays<br>
Stable replicon cell reporter assays:<br>
The compounds of the present invention were examined for activity in the inhibition of HCV RNA replication in a cellular assay. The assay demonstrated that the present compounds exhibit activity against HCV replicons functional in a cell culture. The cellular assay was based on a bicistronic expression construct, as described by Lohmann et al. (1999) Science vol. 285 pp. 110-113 with modifications described by Krieger et al. (2001) Journal of Virology 75: 4614-4624, in a multi-target screening strategy. In essence, the method was as follows.<br>
The assay utilized the stably transfected cell line Huh-7 luc/neo (hereafter referred to as Huh-Luc). This cell line harbored an RNA encoding a bicistronic expression construct comprising the wild type NS3-NS5B regions of HCV type Ib translated from an Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV), preceded by a reporter portion (FfL-luciferase), and a selectable marker portion (neoR,<br>
neomycine phosphotransferase). The construct was bordered by 5' and 3' NTRs (non-translated regions) from HCV type1b.. Continued culture of the replicon cells in the presence of G418 (neoR) was dependent on the replication of the HCV RNA. The stably transtected replicon cells that expressed HCV RNA, which replicated autonomously and to high levels, encoding inter alia luciferase, were used for screening the antiviral compounds.<br>
Cellular Assay Experimental Method:<br>
The replicon cells were plated in 384 well plates in the presence of the test and control compounds which were added in various concentrations. Following an incubation of three days, HCV replication was measured by assaying luciferase activity (using standard luciferase assay substrates and reagents and a Perkin Elmer ViewLuxTm ultraHTS microplate imager). Replicon cells in the control cultures had high luciferase expression in the absence of any inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the compound on luciferase activity was monitored on the Huh-Luc cells, enabling a dose-response curve for each test compound. EC50 values were then calculated, which value represents the amount of the compound required to decrease by 50% the level of detected luciferase activity, or more specifically, the ability of the genetically linked HCV replicon RNA to replicate.<br>
The compounds tested were found to have activities as follows: Table 3(Table Removed) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
