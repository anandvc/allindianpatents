THE PATENTS ACT. 1970<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION:<br>
(see Section 10 )<br>
AN IMPROVED PROCESS OF PRODUCTION OF CHANNA PODO<br>
We, NATIONAL DAIRY DEVELOPMENT BOARD, a body corporate constituted under the National Dairy Development Act 1987 (37 of 1987), Anand, State of Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention pertains to the field of production of finished product from raw materials in the food processing industry.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Chhana Podo is an indigenous milk product of Orissa state in eastern region of India. Eastern region of India is well known for Chhana based delicacies. Chhana Podo has same status in Orissa as Rasogolla in west Bengal. It consists of Chhana as a base material, which is normally manufactured from cow milk.<br>
Chhana Podo is a light brown colored product produced by slow heating / baking of mix of Chhana, sugar and suji (semolina) / maida (wheat flour). It is a sweet cake like, soft and spongy product with fat rich taste. Consumption pattern of this sweet is similar to other sweets available in the market.<br>
The alternative names of "Chhana Podo" are "Chhana Poda", "Chhena Poda" and "Chhena Podo".<br>
Under the Chemical composition heading, we have mentioned that the market product varies in following composition.<br>
Moisture% - 48.3 to 55.0 Fat% = 9.0tol5.0 Protein% = 14.6 to 19.4 Sugar% = 19.1 to 25.2<br>
Fat and protein comes from milk. If non-standardized milk in taken then no definite level of fat and protein is achieved in the final product, but we are achieving in our product. Similarly sugar is added by different manufacturers in different ranges. Some manufacturers add more sugar to increase their profitability of the product. Moreover, the sweet makers do not sell the packed product, so they are not concerned about shelf life.More moisture will lead to very low shelf Life..As.a..matter of practice, a particular day's production is sold on the same day.<br>
In our trial details in example 10 of our application, we have given in details that how the composition affects the quality of product and there fore the need arose to standardize the product in terms of ingredients (eg. particular quality of milk in fat% and snf% terms), process of manufacture (particular time and temp, combination for baking), packing etc.<br>
The manufacture and marketing of Chhana Podo has largely been in the hands of traditional sweetmeat makers or local confectioners. They adopt small-scale non-standardized methods under highly unhygienic conditions. Generally, two methods are adopted by the sweetmeat makers for manufacturing this product.<br><br>
Method I<br>
 Adough is prepared by mixing chhana with sugar, semolina and water. The dough is made into a round shape and covered with Saal-leaf and kept for over night on a traditional coal-fired oven, which is in the state of gradual extinguishing. By overnight the product is baked, it is men cooled and is ready for sale by the next morning.<br><br><br>
Metho ll<br><br>
In the other method the dough consisting of chhana, sugar, semolina and water is placed in a flat bottom Karahi previously Uned with oil The vessel is then covered with a Saal-leaf and heated on a gas stove on low flame for nearly half an hour. A metal plate (tin or iron) is kept over the leaf with fired wood pieces on it, and by heat transfer through the metal plate the product is baked.<br>
Chemical composition:<br>
Samples of Chhana Podo were collected from Bhubaneshwar (Orissa) market and analyzed<br>
for fat, protein, sugar and moisture content. Wide variations of these were observed in the<br>
market samples which are as follows:<br>
Moisture Percent	48.3 to 55.0<br>
Fat Percent	09.0 to 15.0<br>
Protein Percent	14.6 to 19.4<br>
Sugar Percent	19.1 to 25.2<br>
Wide variations in the sensory attributes with respect to .colour and appearance, flavour, body and texture, sweetness and overall acceptability were observed. _In order to be able to overcome these variations, it is necessary to optimize the process of production of chhana podo in terms of composition of ingredients; mechanization of the process was necessary to improve the hygienic quality of the product.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION!<br>
This invention describes an improved process of producing hygienic and high quality of chhana podo that is suitable as a finished product in the food processing industry. To be able to do this, a plant layout based on known engineering equipment and production parameters has been designed that is comprising of the following:<br>

INGREDIENTS AND PROCESSING PARAMETERS:<br>
Trial # 1: Effect of fat on acceptability of Chhana Podo<br>
Fat is an important constituent of Chhana Podo. It enriches and mellows the product, giving it a rich flavour. Fat also contributes to the smoothness in body of Chhana Podo. To study the effect on the acceptability of Chhana Podo three different levels of fat in milk viz., 4.0, 4.5 and 5 % were tried. The results are presented in the following table:<br><br>
Fat level (%)	Effect on sensory attributes<br>
4.0	Under developed flavour, Hard Body<br>
4.5	Imparted pleasant, rich, fatty favour<br>
5.0	Too soft body. Oozing of fat during baking and storage.<br>
It was observed that 4.5% fat in milk was most suitable for Chhana Podo preparation.<br>

Trial # 4: Effect of Water on acceptability of Chhana Podo<br>
Water is required to be added in Chhana Podo making for facilitating mixing of the "dry ingredients" (i.e., sugar and semolina) with chhana. It replenishes the moisture that evaporates during baking and helps in developing characteristics porous body of Chhana Podo. The effect of addition of three different levels of water i.e., 25, 30 and 35% of chhana were studied on the sensory attributes of Chhana Podo. The findings are presented in the following table:<br><br>
Water level	[Effect on sensory attributes<br>

40	Higher moisture content, loose body, dull colour &amp; appearance<br>
50	Optimum moisture content, imparted proper body and texture anc appropriate colour and appearance to Chhana Podo<br>
60	Dry product because of less moisture content, hard body unacceptable blackish brown colour, crust formation.<br>
EXAMPLE 11.0 PROCESS OF CHHANA PODO PRODUCTION<br>
Standardization of Milk: Cow milk is standardized to the required level of fat and snf percentage like 4.5% fat and 8.5% snf, so that required fat, snf could be achieved in the final product.<br>
Chhana Preparation: Standardized milk is taken in milk coagulation vat and is heated to a temperature of 85°C with holding for 10 minutes. Citric acid (3% solution @ 2g citric acid liter of milk) in solution form is added to the milk which is cooled to 80°C. Coagulated milk mass is held in the whey for 15 minutes followed by pouring the coagulated mass into the Chhana whey separation system. Whey is separated out and the curd mass is taken out from the basket of whey separation. Chhana thus obtained consists of moisture in the range of<br>
17<br><br>
50-55%. Chhana obtained can be used on the same day for Chhana Podo production or may be kept in the cold store for producing the product on the next day.<br>
Chhana Podo Mix: Mix is prepared in the mixer consisting of a double jacketed bowl and an agitator with side scrapping blades for mixing the ingredients like Chhana, Sugar, Suji and water.<br>
All the ingredients are weighed and put into the bowl so that Chhana lumps are broken and mix of pulpy consistency is prepared. The mix is collected in a small vat or trolley.<br>
Panning of Mix: Chhana Podo mix having pulpy consistency is taken to the panning machine having auger type system to fill the known quantity of mix mass into the pans. Filling into pans is done @560-570 gm / pan so that 500 gm of Chhana Podo is attained after moisture evaporation during baking. The panned hoops are stacked in a shelved trolley, which is used to carry filled pans to the oven for baking.<br>
Baking: The filled pans are stacked in the oven which is maintained at a temperature of 200+5° C. The product is baked in the oven for 50+5 minutes at above mentioned temperature. After baking is over, the product is taken out from the oven and is taken for cooling.<br>
Cooling: The baked product when taken out from the oven is at a temperature of 95-96°C this is achieved by switching off heating system and starting the exhaust fan provided for the purpose of cooling. The exhaust fan throws out the hot air/heat, which leads to cooling of the product. The product is cooled down to 40-45°C it is ready for de-panning.<br>
De-panning: De-panning is achieved by tilting the pan with product up side down on a tray and gentle hammering the aluminum pans.<br>
Cutting and Packaging: The product after de-panning is cut into small pack sizes of 100 g and 250 g from a block of 500 g. whereas for packing 500g, the block is kept as such. The<br>
18<br><br>
product is vacuum packed in the multi layer pouches having barrier properties to moisture and oxygen. The packed product in secondary pack is stored at a temperature of 5-10°C.<br>
