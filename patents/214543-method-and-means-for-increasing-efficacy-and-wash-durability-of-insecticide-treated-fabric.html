				<td>METHOD AND MEANS FOR INCREASING EFFICACY AM) WASH DURABILITY OF INSECTICIDE TREATED FABRIC<br>
Field of The Invention:<br>
This invention relates to the finishing of washable fabric intended to be made into wearing apparel and more specifically to the finishing of such fabric with an insecticide, such as permethrin, by a process that increases the knock-down efficacy and the retention of the insecticide in the fabric through successive washings.<br>
Background of The Invention:<br>
Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid which exhibits repellent as well as knockdown and kill activity against insects.  Pyrethroids, including both the naturally occurring compounds and their synthetically prepared analogs effectively control a variety of pests, such as ticks, cockroaches, houseflies, mosquitoes, black flies, fleas, and other flying or crawling insects.  Pyrethroids are not harmful to plants, food, animals or humans, and leave no harmful residues.<br>
Despite these highly favourable characteristics, permethrin has had only limited general utility because of its relatively short-lived insecticidal activity.  This is due to the decomposition of<br>
permethrin into a nonactive, non-insecticidal product in the presence of oxygen and ultraviolet light.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,198,287 discloses a tent fabric with a water repellent and flame retardant coating that includes the insecticide permethrin. The patent teaches that placing the permethrin in the coating on the inner surface of the tent enables the tent fabric and outer surface coating to shield the permethrin from oxygen and ultraviolet light and thereby provide an effective life of more than six months for the permethrin.<br>
U.S. Patent application No. 5,252,387 teaches that permethrin can be preserved in insect repellent fabrics by placing a barrier over the permethrin to protect the permethrin from degradation by ultraviolet light and oxygen.<br>
Another problem with using permethrin as an insect repellent in washable clothing is retaining the permethrin in washable garments through successive wash cycles.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,089,298 offers one solution to the problem of retaining permethrin in clothing-through successive wash cycles.  This patent teaches that permethrin is retained in garments impregnated with permethrin and amylopectin, a water soluble form of starch, through a substantially greater<br>
number of launderings cycles than garments treated only with permethrin.<br>
Indian Patent application No. 442/DEL/96 teaches that an initial concentration in a fabric of approximately 1.25 grams of permethrin per square meter is strong enough to repel insects and also teaches that the addition of polyvinyl acetate as a binder for the permethrin dispersion preserves the effectiveness of the permethrin through more washings of the fabric than does the amylopectin of U.S. 5,089,298.<br>
Applicant's research has continued for effective use of permethrin in repelling mosquitoes and other insects, and applicants have found polymeric binders other than the polyvinyl acetate disclosed in Indian patent application No. 442/DEL/96 to be effective in prolonging the durability of pertnethrin.  Applicants have also found a process of applying permethrin to the fabric that effectively increases the repellency of insects and that maintains the effectiveness of permethrin after repeated launderings of the treated fabric.<br>
Summary of The Invention:<br>
The Indian patent application 442/DEL/96 teaches the addition of polyvinyl acetate to the permethrin by first impregnating the fabric with polyvinyl acetate and then impregnating the fabric in a second<br>
tank with a permethrin dispersion that provides an initial concentration in a fabric of approximately 1.25 grams of permethrin per square meter which is more that enough to repel insects.<br>
Applicants have now learned that a dispersion of permethrin and an effective polymeric binder can be effectively applied to the fabric by impregnation in a single tank.<br>
Applicants have also discovered that permethrin can be effectively applied to the fabric in a surface coating on only one side of the fabric. There are, then, two embodiments of the present invention: (1) Impregnating the fabric with permethrin, and (2) Surface coating only one side of the fabric with permethrin.<br>
In the first embodiment, fabric that is to be made into washable garments is dyed and finished in the normal manner and then impregnated with a suitable polymeric binder and with a dispersion of permethrin, and sometimes a cross-linking agent.  In the second embodiment, only one side of any desired fabric is surface coated with an insecticide and thickener, and sometimes a suitable polymeric binder with or without a cross-linking agent.<br>
Brief Description of The Drawings:<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of fabric that has been treated with permethrin by impregnating the fabric with a dispersion of permethrin and a polymeric binder;<br>
Figure 1A is an enlarged sectional view taken substantially along the line 1A-1A in Figure 1;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of fabric that has been treated with permethrin by surface coating one side of the fabric with a dispersion of permethrin and polymeric binder;<br>
Figure 2A is an enlarged sectional view taken substantially along the line 2A-2A in Figure 2; and<br>
Figures 3 and 4 are perspective views illustrating the apparatus and the procedures used in determining the effectiveness of permethrin as an insect repellent.<br>
Detailed Description of The Invention: The fabric or substrate with which this invention is used may be of any desired type.  For example, the fabric may be a plain weave polyester fabric or a 65/35 blend of polyester and cotton suitable for manufacture of clothing. Alternatively, but not exclusively, the fabric may be intended for a military battle dress uniform made<br>
of either 100% rip-stop cotton or 50% nylon and 50% cotton.<br>
A permethrin dispersion that provides approximately 1.25 grams of permethrin per square meter in a selected fabric was used to find the effectiveness of polymeric binders; and cross-linking agents as synergists to prolong the retention of permethrin in washable fabrics.<br>
The exact amount of permethrin to be added depends on the type of fabric being treated. Different fabric absorb or assimilate different amounts of the permethrin dispersion.  The exact amount of permethrin is determined by successive trials to find the amount necessary to provide an initial concentration in the selected fabric of approximately 1.25 grams of permethrin per square meter.  That initial concentration has been found to provide effective insecticide properties and/or insect contact repellency.<br>
The First Embodiment - Impregnation<br>
Figures 1 and 1A illustrate a fabric 10 that has been impregnated with a solution containing a dispersion of permethrin and a polymeric binder. The permethrin and the polymeric binder are indicated by dots 11 in Figure 1A.  As seen in the sectional view of Figure 1A, the dots 11 are spread throughout the fabric 10.  Permethrin is spread<br>
throughout the fabric in the same way when the permethrin is applied to fabric by impregnating the fabric in a bath containing only permethrin.<br>
Fabrics have been impregnated with several solutions, each of which contain the same dispersion of permethrin and the same percentage of different polymeric binders and/or cross-linking agents.  The treated fabrics were then subjected to home launderings and the percentage of permethrin then remaining in the fabric was measured to compare the effectiveness of the binders in retaining permethrin in the fabric.<br>

The Home Laundering Procedure All of the home launderings in the foregoing examples were done in a KENMORE Ultra Fabric Care Heavy Duty 80 Series Residential Washing Machine. The sample was weighed and ballast fabrics were used to bring the load weight to four pounds.  A 50 ml. beaker of ALL detergent was measured and added to the load.  The Washing machine was programmed for its normal cycle at its regular setting.  The fabrics were washed in hot water (120°F.), with a cold rinse.<br>
After each wash cycle, the load was dried with medium heat for 20 minutes in a HUEBSCH ORIGINATORS 30 Plus Commercial Dryer and cooled for 5 minutes.<br>
The Test Procedure<br>
The instrument and test procedure that were used for determining the quantity of permethrin remaining in the fabric after launderings is set forth below! Gas Chromatography (GC):<br>
Tre Metrics 541:    Electon Capture Detector<br>
Column: 6- foot by 1/8 inch I.D. glass column packed with 3% OV 225 on 100/120 mesh Gas Chrome Q or equivalent.<br>
Gas:  5% Methane, 95% Argon<br>
Condition: Oven Temperature:	245°C<br>
Injector Temperature:	225°C<br>
Detector Temperature:	350°C<br>
Injection Volume:       2ul<br>
Carrier gas flow rate:  50ml/minute<br>
Run Time:	Approximately 20<br>
minutes per sample.<br>
Test Procedure:<br>
Place each 12 square inches of the test specimen into a Soxhlet extraction thimble.  This is prepared by cutting three layers of the test fabric with a 2" x 2" die.  Add 175 ml. of acetonitrile/methanol mixture and several boiling chips into a 250 ml. heat resistance flask.  Assemble the Soxhlet extraction apparatus and extract the permethrin impregnated specimens for 6 hours. After extraction, the extract is to be diluted to 200 ml. total volume in a volumetric flask.  Inject 1 ul of the extract into the GC.<br>
Calculations:<br>
A series of standard solutions of Permethrin are injected into the GC, integration of the two cis and trans peaks are recorded. A linear plot of the integrated area of both cis and trans peaks vs. Concentration is created, and the equation of the line recorded.  Using the equation of the line and interacted area of an unknown's peaks, extrapolation to the unknowns concentration can be accomplished. This is to be reported in units of grams per square meter.<br>
Note: If the linear plot's concentration axis is in units of grams per square meter, the extrapolation is expedited.<br>
The Increased Efficacy of Surface Coating Fabrics that are surface coated with permethrin have a greater insect repellent efficacy that fabrics that are impregnated with equal amounts of permethrin.  One reason is apparent from a comparison of the physical location of permethrin in the fabric of Figure 2A with the physical location of permethrin in the fabric of Figure 1A.<br>
In Figure 2A all of the permethrin is located on only one major surface of the fabric.  When that major surface becomes the outer surface of a garment, all of the permethrin is positioned to<br>
contact insects.  At the same time it is positioned our of contact with the skin of the wearer.<br>
In figure 1A the same quantity of permethrin is dispersed throughout the body of the fabric. Consequently, only the portion of the permethrin that is located on the surface of the fabric that becomes the outer surface of a garment is available for the repellency of insects.  The rest of the permethrin is scattered throughout the fabric, as shown in Figure 1A with as much of the permethrin on the inside of a garment made from fabric as there is on the outside.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 illustrate the apparatus and procedure used in an actual test that has confirmed the increased efficacy of surface coated permethrin in repelling insects.  That test is the subject of Examples XI and XII.<br>
As indicated in Figure 3, the test was carried out by placing an inverted petri dish cover 30 on a card 31 that is positioned sequentially on differently treated pieces of fabric 32.  One piece of fabric 32 was treated in accordance with Example XI, and another piece of fabric was treated in accordance with Example XII.<br>
In each test, ten female aedes aegypti mosquitoes 33 were confined in the petri dish cover 30, as noted in Figure 3, and card 31 was gently<br>
slid from beneath the petri dish cover, allowing the mosquitoes to be in direct contact with the treated fabric 32.  After the mosquitoes are exposed to the treated fabric 32 for an allotted time (5 to 60 minutes) the card 31 was gently returned to its initial position beneath the petri dish cover to terminate the mosquitoes' exposure to the treated fabric.  Knockdown counts are recorded 15 and 60 minutes after the mosquitoes are first exposed to the treated fabric by removal of the card 31.<br>
Example XI Impregnation<br>
Formula<br>
Water     98%<br>
Permethrin 2%<br>
Calculated concentration of permethrin  1.14 grams per square meter.<br>
Analysed concentration of permethrin    1.17 grams per square meter.<br>
The fabric face was exposed to insects in a enclosure for 5 minutes.  After 15 minutes, 25% of the aedes aegypti mosquitoes were knocked down.<br>
After 60 minutes, 80% of the aedes aegypti mosquitoeswere knocked down.<br>
Example XIH Surface Coated<br>
Formula<br>
Water         92.5%<br>
Permethrin     5.5%<br>
Methocel       2.0% (Thickener)<br>
Calculated concentration of permethrin  1.25 grams per square meter<br>
Analysed concentration of permethrin    0.85 grams per square meter.<br>
The fabric face was exposed to insects in an enclosure for 5 minutes.  After 15 minutes, 50.0% of the aedes aegypti mosquitoes were knocked down. After 60 minutes, 95.0% of the aedes aegypti mosquitoes were knocked down.<br>
It is apparent from this data that the surface treatment creates a more efficacious pest control fabric, which achieves quicker and greater knockdown than the impregnated fabric.<br>
Another advantage of surface coating fabric intended for garments is that a surface coating in the outside of the garment minimises skin contact to the wearer and maximises the location of permethrin for the contact by insects.<br>
There is thus provided an improved method of increasing the durability of permethrin to repeated launderings of a treated fabric and an improved method of increasing the efficacy of an insecticide to repel insects.  Although all of the examples herein have utilised permethrin as the insecticide, the described methods may be used with other insecticides within the scope of the invention.<br>
Although specific terms have been used in describing the invention they have been used in a descriptive sense only, and not for the purpose of limitation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
