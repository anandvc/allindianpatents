DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A detailed description of a preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be given below.<br>
As shown in the drawings, a light-permeable key pad I has an operating portion la and a non-operating portion lb connected to the operating portion la formed as an integral body from transparent si 1 icon  rubber,  other  transparent  rubber  or  transparent<br>
5<br><br>
thermopoastic elastomer such as vinyl chloride based elastomer, polyolefin base elastomer, polysterene-polybutadiene copolymer thermoplastic elastomer, ethylene vinyl acetate elastomer, chlorinated polyethylene elastomer, polyurethane rubber. By forming the keypad 1 from rubber or a thermoplastic elastomer, it is possible to utilize the rubber-like characteristics to obtain click-sens itivi ty and rapid operation sensitivity with the operating portion la. Further, in addition to the case in which the operating portion la is formed from a thin skirt portion lc, which rises up along a slant from the lower portion of the side surface of the non-operating portion lb, and a key top support portion Id which is integrally supported at the upper portion of the skirt portion lc, it is possible to construct the operating portion la in which forms the erect thin skirt portion lb toward the upper slanting portion thereof, or, the slanting skirt portion is eliminated and the key top supporting portion Id extends out horizontally from a thick side surface of the non~operating portion lb. In this connection, it should be noted that the present invention is not limited to these structures, and it is possible to utilize any other structure so long as it is possible to support a key top 2. In the case where a skirt portion lc is provided, this skirt portion lc carries out a click action.<br>
Further, the operating portion la is arranged above a substrate (not shown in the drawings) at a position corresponding to a fixed contact point on the substrate, with a rubber click structure being created by forming an electrically conductive contact member on the underside of the operating portion la, or with a dome click structure being created by means of a metal dome switch (not shown in the drawings).<br>
The key top 2, made from a thermoplastic resin such as ABS, polycarbonate, acrylic resin, is fixedly mounted to the top of the key top support portion Id by means of a tranparent adhesive 3. In this connection, the upper surface of the key top 2 may have any of a variety of shapes, such as a curved shape which slants in one<br>
6<br><br>
direction, for example. Further, the lower portion of the key top 2 may be formed to include a brim portion 2a, as shown in Fig. 1, or the lower portion of the key top 2 may be formed without such a brim portion. In general, to enable light to pass through the key top 2, a transparent or translucent material around lmm thick (e.g., in the range 0.8mm - 1.5mm) is used to make the key top 2, and in this regard it is possible to use a white-colored material which allows light at a certain intensity to pass therethrough. In the case where the key top 2 is formed from such white-colored material, there is no need to form the partial transmission light reflecting membrane 4a described below.<br>
The adhesive 3 is an adhesive used to bond the key top 2, made of a thermoplastic resin such as ABS, polycarbonate, acrylic resin, with the silicon key pad 1, made of a silicon rubber or other rubber material or thermoplastic elastomer, which is an integral body formed from the operating portion la and the non-operating portion lb. In this connection, the adhesive 3 may be any adhesive which makes it possible to bind two different materials together; for example, it is possible to use a silicon type adhesive in the case of silicon rubber.<br>
Further, with the exception of the underside surface, a printed pattern (character) layer 4 is formed in the surface of the key top using any of the methods described below.<br>
In one method, a partial transmission light reflecting membrane 4a having a bright color to reflect white light and the like is formed on all surfaces the light permeable resin key top 2 except for the underside surface thereof. For example, it is possible to use a white coating as the light reflect ing membrane. Next, a solid chromatic color printing is carried out in red, blue, yellow or the like to form a pattern comprised of letters, symbols, figures, with all of the solid printing 4b except for the portion containing the pattern being covered by a black opaque membrane 4c. Further, the opaque membrane 4c and the portion of the solid printing 4b which<br>
7<br><br>
contains the pattern (character or the like) is covered by a transparent protective membrane 5 formed from an acrylic resin such as urethane.<br>
Further, in the case where the body of the resin key top 2 is formed to have a thickness around lmm, i t is possible to use the above method to form a printed pattern (character) layer 4 without having to apply a white-colored coating to the surface of the key top 2 so long as it is possible for the body of the key top 2 to reflect white light and the like and at the same time allow light at a certain intensity to pass therethrough.<br>
Then, after forming the printed pattern layer 4 in the upper surface of the key top 2, the underside surface of the key top 2 is fixed to the upper surface of a key operating portion la of a key pad 1 by means of the transparent adhesive 3.<br>
Next, the means for making the illumination key ultralight will be described.<br>
As is structurally shown in Fig. 5-8, an operating shaft 9 is integrally formed at a central portion of the underside of the transplarent keytop 2 which is mounted and bonded to the top of the trasnparent rubber or thermoplastic elasltomer key operating portion lb. Further, a cavity 10 for making a thin keytop 2 is carved out to form a circular space to receive the operating shaft 9 of the underside of the keytop 2. Further, the thickness of the underside of the keytop 2 should have roughly the same thickness structure. The material used for the keytop 2 should be chosen so as to prevent the keytop 2 from being indented when the keytop 2 is struck by a finger. Of course, the contact surfaces of the keytop 2 and the key operating portion la are fixed by means of a transparent adhesive.<br>
By forming the operating shaft 9 on the underside of the keytop 2, it is possible to guarantee reliable ON/OFF operations of the key operating portion lb when the keytop 2 is pressed with a finger.<br>
8<br><br>
When select ing a material for the keytop 2, in order to achieve an even higher reduction in weight, the transparent resin keytop 2 shown in Fig. 7 should preferable be formed from a hard foaming resin such as polyurethane foam.<br>
In order to vastly improve the bonding strength when fixing the contact surfaces of the keytop 2 and the key operating portion la by means of a transparent adhesive 3, the lower portion of the operating shaft 9 of the transparent resin keytop 2 is fitted into the concave portion lg formed in the central upper portion of the transparent rubber or thermoplastic elastomer key operating portion la. In this way, because a vertical bonding is carried out on the fitting portion 11 of the lower portion of the operating shaft 9 fitted into the concave portion lg, it is possible to achieve an increase in bonding strength several times higher compared to horizontal bonding.<br>
To further increase the bonding strength, a protruding portion le as shown in Fig. 8 is formed on a central portion of the upper surface of the transparent rubber or thermoplastic elastomer key operating portion lb, and an insertion hole If is formed in the central portion of the protruding portion le into which the operating shaft 9 of the transparent resinkeytop 2 fitted and vertically bonded by the applications of a transparent adhesive.<br>
In Fig. 8, the number 12 indicates a PET or a metal dome swi tch.<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 9, an annular erect flange 13 is formed near the outer periphery of the upper surface of the transparent rubber or thermoplastic elastomer key operating portion lb, and the outer circumferential surface of the annular erect flange 13 is bonded by means of an adhesive to a contact surface of the outer peripherial surface of the inside of the cavity portion 10 of the transparent resin keytop 2, whereby it becomes possible to maintain a sufficient bonding strength while at the same time achieving a reduction in weight. Further, it is possible to use or not use an<br>
9<br><br>
adhesive when fitting the lower portion of the operating shaft 9 into the concave portion of the central portion of the upper surface of the transparent rubber or thermoplastic elastomer key operating portion lb.<br>
Now, by having the structure described above, the illumination key according to the present invention makes it possible to reliable recognize the character (pattern) on the key top 2 even when the upper surface of the key top 2 has a curved or slanting shape. Furthermore, because the key operating portion creates a rubber-like click sensitivity and a rubber-like elasticity while the resin of the key top portion is made rigid, and because it is possible to reliably achieve a strong bond between the key operating portion and the key top, the illumination key according to the present invention makes it possible to reliably carry out key operations by preventing misoperations and other problems such as peeling.<br>
Consequently, the present invention makes it possible to easily and cheaply provide an illumination key and a method of manufacturing such i llumination key, in which a key operating portion is given a rubber-likeclicksensitivity and a rubber-like elasticity, the key top portion is made from a rigid resin, and a reliably strong bond is created between the key operating portion and the key top.<br>
In particular, the structure described above makes the illumination key according to the present invention suitable for use in thin-type devices such as cellular phones and the like.<br>
Further, because the lower portion of the operating shaft of the keytop is fitted into the concave portion formed in the central portion of the upper surface of the key operating portion when the contact surfaces of the keytop and key operating portion are bonded together, it is possible to carry out a vertical bonding, and this makes it possible to improve the bonding strength by several times in addition to that achieved by horizontal bonding, whereby it becomes possible to increase the bonding strength for a small amount of contact surface. Furthermore, by forming a protruding portion<br>
10<br><br>
on the central portion of the upper surface of the key operating portion, and by fitting and bonding the operating shaft of the keytop into the insertion hole of such protruding portion, it is possible to achieve an even higher effective bonding.<br>
Further, in the present invention, by forming an operating shaft at the central portion of the underside of the keytop and a cavity around the periphery of such operating shaft, it becomes possible to make a thin keytop whereby it becomes possible to reduce the entire weight of the key. Furthermore, by forming the keytop from a hard foaming resin, it is possible to achieve an even higher reduction in weight while preventing the keytop from being indented when struck.<br>
Furthermore, an annular erect flange is formed near the outer periphery of the upper surface of the transparent rubber or thermoplastic elastomer key operating portion, and the outer circumferential surface of the outer peripherial surface of the inside of the cavity portion of the transparent resin keytop, whereby it becomes possible to maintain a sufficient bonding strength while at the same time achieving a reduction in weight.<br>
Finally, it is to be understood that many changes and additions may be made to the embodiments described above without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention as defined in the appended Claims.<br>
