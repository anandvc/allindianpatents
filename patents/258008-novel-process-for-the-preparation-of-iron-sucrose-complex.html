By this process, iron sucrose complex was prepared by heating ferric hydroxide with sucrose in an alkali medium at 50 -60°C and isolating the complex by precipitating with methanol or acetone.<br>
US 3,821,192(1974) by Montgomery, et.al, discloses a process for preparing a stable, soluble complex of iron with glucose, maltose or dextrin. This, however, does not include sucrose. They used ferric hydroxide derived from ferric chloride and polymerised in presence of carbohydrate at pH 11.0-14.0<br>
De Amdrosi, et.al US 4,746,730(1988), prepared iron saccharate and fructate by basifying aqueous ferric chloride and sucrose/fructose to pH 7.8-8.5 at room temperature.<br><br>
Mehansho et al.in their patent US 4,994,283(1991) disclose a method for preparing iron-sugar complex .This method involves preparation of complex of calcium with sugar. The calcium sucrose complex was further treated with ferrous ammonium sulfate and maleic acid to yield an iron-sugar complex. The multistep process is tedious and is not convenient for the preparation of the complex in commercial quantities.<br>
T. Ramesh baburao, in IN 187116(2002) discloses a method for preparing saccharated iron oxide by reaction of aqueous solution of ferric hydroxide with sucrose at pH between 6.5 to 7.5.<br>
US Patent 2005/020987 discloses a process for the preparation of iron sucrose complex by heating the aqueous solution of sucrose with ferric hydroxide at 100 -105°C.<br>
WO 2005/000210 discloses a method for the preparation of Iron sucrose complex by mixing ferric chloride and sucrose followed by the addition of sodium hydroxide solution to give ferric hydroxide sucrose complex. The disadvantage of this method is the formed iron sucrose complex may have lot of unreacted ferric salts.<br>
