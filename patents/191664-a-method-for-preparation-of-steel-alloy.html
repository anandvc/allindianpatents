				<td>The present invention relates to a method for preparation of steel alloy, particularly to a method for preparation of steel alloy having high carbon content for use in wearing parts, particularly for grinding media and grinding balls. The present invention also relates to the steel alloys with high carbon content, particularly for use in making wearing parts, more particularly for grinding media and grinding balls.<br>
State of the Art<br>
In the mining industry, it is necessary to release valuable minerals from the rock in which they are embedded taking into account their concentration and extraction.<br>
For such release, the mineral must be finely ground and crushed.<br>
Considering  only  the  grinding  stage,  it  is estimated that 750,000 to 1 million tons of grinding media are annually used worldwide, in the form of spherical balls or truncated cone-shaped or cylindrical cylpebs. Grinding media commonly used:<br>
1.	Low alloyed martensitic steels (0.7 - 1%<br>
carbon, alloy elements less than 1%) formed by rolling or by<br>
forging followed by heat-treatment to obtain a surface<br>
hardness of 60-65 Rc.<br>
2.	Martensitic cast-iron alloyed with chrome (1.7<br>
- 3.5% carbon, 9-30% chrome) formed by casting and heat-<br>
treatment to obtain a hardness of 60-68 Rc in all sections.<br>
3. Low alloyed pearlitic white iron (3-4.2% carbon, alloy elements less than 2%), untreated and With a hardness of 45-55 Re obtained by casting.<br>
All of the present solutions have their own disadvantages:<br>
-	for the forged martensitic steels, it is the investment costs for the forging or rolling machines and the heat-treatment apparatus which raises energy consumption.<br>
-	with regard to the chrome alloyed irons, the supplementary costs are linked with the alloy elements (mainly the chrome) and the heat- treatment.	<br>
-	finally for the low alloyed pearlitic white iron,<br>
the manufacturing costs are generally fairly low but. their<br>
wear-resistance properties are not as good as the other<br>
solutions. Further, usually only grinding media of less<br>
than 60 mm are industrially produced.	<br>
Overall, in the case of minerals where the rock is very abrasive (e.g. gold, copper, ...), the present solutions do not completely satisfy the users as the costs of the products and materials subject to wear (grinding baits and other castings), still contributes greatly towards the cost of production of the valuable metals.<br>
Aim of the Invention <br>
The object of the invention is to provide steels having improved properties and, particularly, to overcome the problems and disadvantages of the state of the art solutions for wear parts (particularly grinding media). The composition, casting and cooling conditions after casting of the invention allow wear resistance, especially in very abrasive conditions, which is comparable to forged steels and chrome cast-irons but with  less cost  and superior to<br>
pearlitic cast-irons (but with a comparable cost).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a method for preparation of steel alloy having high carbon content for use in wearing parts, particularly for grinding media and grinding balls, wherein an alloyed steel comprising carbon from 1.1 to 2.0% weight, manganese from 0.5 to 3.5% weight, chrome from 1.0 to 4.0% weight, silicon from 0.6 to 1.2% weight and the remainder being iron with the usual impurity content is, after casting, subjected to a stage of heat-treatment consisting of cooling from a temperature above 900°C to a temperature of about 500°C at a cooling rate of between 0.30 and 1.90°C/s to provide a final metallographic structure mainly of non-equilibrium fine pearlite and having a hardness between 47 Re and 54 Re.<br>
Other objects and disadvantages of the present invention will become apparent from reading the following description of the characteristics of the invention and preferred embodiments thereof.<br>
Characteristic Elements of the Invention<br>
The invention provides an alloy steel of high carbon content characterized in that their composition complies with the following composition expressed in % weight:<br>
carbon      from 1.1 to 2.0%<br>
manganese    from 0.5 to 3.5%<br>
chrome      from 1.0 to 4.0%<br>
silicon     from 0.6 to 1.2%<br>
The remainder being made up of iron with the usual impurity content, such that they provide a metallographic structure mainly comprising non-equilibrium fine pearlite, with a hardness of between 47 Rc and 54 Rc.<br>
Preferably, for grinding media, particularly grinding balls, the carbon content is between 1.2 and 2.0% preferably between 1.3 and 1.7% to achieve an optimal wear resistance while maintaining shock resistance.<br>
In practice, it is advisable to select the manganese content as a function of the diameter of the grinding ball and the rate of cooling to obtain the fine pearlite structure.<br>
The following compositions are interesting with regard to the resistance to wear for grinding media, particularly grinding balls of 100 mm diameter.<br>
carbon       in the order of 1.5%<br>
manganese    in the order of 1.5 to 3.0%<br>
chrome      in the order of 3.0%<br>
silicon     in the order of 0.8%<br>
For grinding balls, of 70 mm diameter, an alloy; composition of:<br>
carbon      in the order of 1.5%<br>
manganese   in the order of 0.8 to 1.5%<br>
chrome      in the order of 3.0%<br>
silicon     in the order of 0.8% has proven to be particularly advantageous.<br>
The heat-treatment used, is selected to minimize<br>
the quantities of cementite, martensite, austenite and coarse;<br>
pearlite which may appear in the structure of the steel.<br>
According to the invention, the aforementioned;<br>
steels are subjected, after casting, to a heat-treatment,<br>
stage comprising cooling from a temperature above 900 °C to a<br>
temperature of about 500 °C at an average rate of cooling;<br>
between 0.3 and 1.9° C/s to provide the steel with said;<br>
microstructure consisting mainly of non-equilibrium fine<br>
pearlite with a hardness between 47 and 54 Rc.<br>
The casting directly shapes the wear parts and particularly the grinding media and can be carried out by any-known casting technique.<br>
The pearlite structure is obtained by extraction of the still-hot piece out of the casting mould and by adapting the chemical composition to the mass of the piece-and the rate of cooling following extraction from the;mould.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to tha preferred embodiments, given by; way of illustration without, limitation.<br>
In the examples, the percentages are expressed in percentage weight.<br>
Examples 1 to 4<br>
In all the examples, a steel composition of 1.5% carbon, 3% chrome and 0.8% silicon, the remainder being iron with the usual impurity content, is implemented.' The specific manganese and chrome contents expressed in percentage weight are given for the different examples in table 1 for different: sizes of balls.<br>
Table 1 (Table Removed) <br><br>
After complete solidification, the piece is extracted from its mould at the highest possible temperature which is compatible with easy manipulation and preferably above 900°C.<br>
The piece is then cooled in a homogeneous manner at a rate defined as a function of its mass.<br>
This controlled cooling is maintained until a temperature of 500°C after which the cooling is immaterial.<br>
The average of cooling expressed in C/s between the temperatures of 1000°C and 500°C is given in table 2 for the two examples mentioned above.<br><br>
Table 2 (Table Removed) <br>
The main advantages of this heat-treatment are that<br>
i ic enables the fine pearlite structure to be achieved most<br>
easily.  Also, use can be made of the residual heat of the<br>
piece after casting, thus reducing production costs.<br>
The micrographs of figures 1 and 2 shdw the<br>
structure of steels obtained according to the invention.<br><br>
Figure 1 magnified 400 times, shows the micrograph of a 100<br>
mm ball whose chemical composition, expressed in<br>
percentage weight is:<br>
1.5% carbon<br>
1.9% manganese<br>
3.0% chroma<br>
0.3% silicon<br>
After extraction from the mould, this castiag was uniformly cooled from a temperature of 1100°C to ambient temperature at a rate* of 1.30° C/s.<br>
The measured Rockwell hardness is 51 Re;  The structure consists of fine pearlite, 8-10% cementine and at least 5-7% martensitfc. Figure 2  magnified 40C times, shows the micrograph of a 70<br>
mm ball having the following chemical composition,<br>
expressed in % weight:<br>
1.5% carbon<br>
.5% manganese 3.0% chrome 0.8% silicon<br>
This piece was uniformly cooled after extraction<br>
j<br>
from a temperature of 1100° C at a cooling rate of 1.50° C/s to ambient temperature.<br>
The measured Rockwell hardness is 52 Rc.;1  The<br>
1:<br>
structure comprises fine pearlite, 5-7% martensite.<br>
The grinding media or balls whose micrographs are shown in figures 1 and 2 have been subjected to wear tests to check their behavior and their properties in an industrial environment.<br>
The wear resistance of the alloy of the invention has thus been evaluated by the technique of marked! balls trials. This technique comprises inserting a predetermined quantity of balls made with the alloy of the invention into an industrial grinding mill. First, the balls are sorted by weight and identified by bore holes, together with balls of the same weight, made of one or different alloys known from the state of the art. After a set period of operation, the mill is stopped and the marked balls are recovered.' The balls are weighed and the difference in weight allocs the performance of the different alloys tested to be compared. These checks are repeated several times to obtain a statistically valid value.<br>
A first test was carried out in a mill; on a particularly abrasive mineral containing more chain 70% quartz. The 100 mm diameter balls were tested each week for five weeks. The reference ball of martensitic high chrome white iron wore down from an initial weight of 4,600: kg to 2,800 kg. The relative resistance to wear of the different alloys are summarized below:<br>
12% Chrome martensitic white iron of 64 Rc 1.00 x<br>
steel of the invention of 51 Rc 0.98 x<br>
Similar tests were carried out in other mills where<br>
the treated mineral was equally very abrasive, but where the conditions of impact compared to the conditions of operation of the mill were different.<br>
The results obtained with the balls made of the alloy of the invention were very close (0.9 to 1.1' times better) to those obtained by the high chrome white iron.<br>
These performances of resistance to abrasives wear of the pearlitic alloy according to the invention allow the user's costs associated with grinding to be noticeably reduced.<br>
Indeed, the simplification of the manufacturing processes, the reduction in installation and operating- costs, and the reduction in alloy elements in comparison with iehrome iron provides a more economic manufacture.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
