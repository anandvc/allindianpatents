Herbicides comprising benzoylcyclohexanediones and sufeners Description<br>
The invention pertains to the technical field of crop protectants, especially herbicide/antidote combinations (active substance/safener combinations) suitable for use against competing weed plants in crop plant cultures.<br>
Numerous active herbicidal substances are known to be inhibitors of the enzyme p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD). For instance, Proc. Br. Crop Prot. Conf. Weeds, 1991,1, 51; Proc. Br. Crop Prot. Conf. Weeds, 1995,1, 35 disclose benzoylcyclohexanediones, benzoylpyrazoles, and benzoylisoxazoles of this kind. More recently, further such active substances have been disclosed, for example, in WO 00/21924 and WO 01/07422.<br>
As with many other active herbicidal s jbstances, these HPPD inhibitors too are not always sufficiently compatible with (i.e., lack sufficient selectivity for) certain important crop plants, such as corn, rice or cereals, whereby imposing narrow limitations on their use. In sdme crops, therefore, they cannot be used, or can be used only at such low application rates that the desired broad herbicidal activity toward weed plants is not ensured. More particularly, many of these herbicides lack complete selectivity for weed plants in com, rice, cereals, sugar cane, and certain other crops.<br>
A known means for overcoming these disadvantages is to use active herbicidal substances in combination with a substance known as a safener or antidote. EP- A 0 943 240, WO 99/66795, and WO 00/30447, for example, describe various combinations of certain HPPD inhibitors with safeners.<br>
A safener is a compound which eliminates or lessens the phytotoxic properties of a herbicide toward crop plants without substantially reducing the herbicidal action toward weed plants.<br><br>
Identifying a safener for a particular group of herbicides is still a difficult task, since the precise mechanisms by which a safener lessens the noxious effect of herbicides are unknown. Consequently, the fact that a compound acts as safener in combination with one particular herbicide does not permit conclusions as to the safener action of such a compound with other groups of herbicides. In the use of safeners to protect crop plants against herbicide damage, it has been found that the safeners in many cases may still have certain disadvantages. These include the following:<br>
•	the safener lessens the action of the herbicides toward the weed plants;<br>
•	the crop plant protecting properties are inadequate;<br>
•	with a given herbicide, the spectrum of crop plants in which the safener/herbicide combination is to be used is too small;<br>
•	a sufficiently large number of herbicides cannot be combined with a given safener.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide further combinations of herbicides from the group of the HPPD inhibitors with safeners that are suitable for raising the selectivity of these herbicides with respect to important crop plants.<br>
Novel combinations have ndw been found of certain herbicides from the group of the HPPD inhibitors which carry selected substituents in position 3 of the benzoyl moiety with numerous other compounds which raise the selectivity of these herbicides with respect to important crop plants.<br>
The invention accordingly provides a herbicidally active composition comprising A)      a herbicidally effective amount of one or more compounds of the formula (I)<br><br><br>

Unless otherwise defined individually, the following definitions generally apply to the radicals in the formulae (I) to (VIII) and subsequent formulae.<br>
The radicals alkyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, alkylamino and alkylthio and the corresponding unsaturated and/or substituted radicals can be in each case straight-chain or branched in the carbon skeleton. Alkyl radicals, also the composite meanings such as alkoxy, haloalkyl and the like, preferably have 1 to 4 carbon atoms and are, for example, methyl, ethyl, n- or i-propyl or n-, i-, t- or 2-butyl. Alkenyl and alkynyl radicals have the meanings of the unsaturated radicals which are possible and which correspond to the alkyl radicals; alkenyl is, for example, allyl, 1-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, 2-methylprop-2-en-1-yl, but-2-en-1-yl, but-3-en-1-yl, 1-methylbut-3-en-1-yI and 1-methyibut-2-en-1-yl. Alkynyl is, for example, propargyl,<br>
but-2-yn-1-yl, but-3-yn-1-yl, 1-methylbut-3-yn-1-yl. "(C1-C4)-AlkylH is the abbreviation<br>
for alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; the same applies analogously to other general definitions of radicals, where the ranges of the possible number of carbon atoms are indicated in brackets.<br>
Cycloalkyl is, preferably, a cyclic alkyl radical having 3 to 8, preferably 3 to 7, especially preferably 3 to 6, carbon atoms, for example cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl,<br><br>
cyclopentyl and cyclohexyl. Cycloalkenyl and cycloalkynyl denote corresponding unsaturated compounds.<br>
Halogen is fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Haloalkyl, haloalkenyl and haloalkynyl are alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl which are partially or fully substituted by halogen, preferably by fluorine, chlorine and/or bromine, in particular by fluorine or chlorine, for example CF3, CHF2, CH2F, CF2CF3, CH2FCCIFM, CCI3, CHCI2,<br>
CH2CH2CI. Haloalkoxy is, for example, OCF3, OCHF2, OCH2F, OCF2CF3&gt;<br>
OCH2CF3 and OCH2CH2CI. This also applies analogously to other halogen<br>

R42     is hydrogen, methyl or ethyl.<br>
The compounds cited here as safeners (antidotes) reduce or prevent phytotoxic effects which may occur when using the herbicidally active substances of the formula (I) in crops of useful plants without substantially affecting the activity of these herbicidally active substances against weed plants. This allows the field of application of conventional crop protection products to be widened quite<br><br>
considerably and to be extended to, for example, crops such as wheat, barley, corn, and sugar cane in which use of the herbicides was hitherto impossible, or of only limited possibility, that is to say at low rates and with a restricted spectrum.<br>
The herbicidally active substances and the abovementioned safeners can be applied together (as a readymix or by the tank mix method) or in succession in any desired sequence. The weight ratio of safener to herbicidally active substance may vary within wide limits and is preferably within the range from 1:100 to 100:1, in particular from 1:10 to 10:1. The optimum amounts of herbicidally active substance and safener in each case depend on the type of the herbicidally active substance used or on the safener used and on the species of the plant stand to be treated and can be determined in each individual case by simple, routine preliminary experiments.<br>
Main fields of application for the combinations according to the invention are, in particular, com, sugar cane and cereal crops for example wheat, rye, barley, oats, rice, sorghum, but also cotton and soybeans, preferably sugar cane , cereals, rice and corn.<br>
Depending on their properties, the safeners employed in accordance with the invention can be used for pretreating the seeds of a crop plant (seed dressing), or be incorporated into the seed furrows prior to sowing or applied together with the herbicide before or after plant emergence. The preemergence treatment includes both the treatment of the area under cultivation prior to sowing and the treatment of the areas under cultivation where the seeds have been planted but the plants have not yet emerged. Joint application with the herbicide is preferred. To this end, tank mixes or readymixes can be employed.<br>
The application rates of safener required may vary within wide limits depending on the indication and the herbicidally active substance used and are generally in the range of from 0.001 to 5 kg, preferably 0.005 to 0.5 kg, of active substance per hectare.<br><br>
The present invention therefore also provides a method of protecting crop plants from phytotoxic side effects of herbicides of the formula (I), which comprises applying an antidote-active amount of a compound of the formula (II), (III), (IV), (V), (VI), (VII) and/or from group (b) to the plants, the seeds of the plants or the area under cultivation, before, after or simultaneously with the herbicidally active substance A of the formula (I).<br>
The herbicide/safener combination according to the invention may also be employed for controlling weed plants in crops of genetically engineered plants which are either known or still to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by particular, advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens causing plant diseases such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the harvested material in terms of quantity, quality, storing properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known which have an increased starch content or an altered starch quality, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use of the combinations-according to the invention is preferred in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for examplsxereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, cassava and corn or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When the combinations according to the invention are employed in transgenic crops, effects on weed plants to be observed in other crops are frequently accompanied by effects which are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, for example an altered or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, altered application rates which may be used, preferably good compatibility with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and altered growth and yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br><br>
The invention therefore also provides for the use of the combination according to the invention for controlling weed plants in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The safeners of the formulae (III) - (VII) and of group (b) and their combinations with one or more of the abovementioned herbicidally active substances of the formula (I) can be formulated in various ways, depending on the biological and/or chemico-physical parameters specified. Examples of suitable formulations which are possible are: wettable powders (WP), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), water-soluble powders (SP)f water-soluble concentrates (SL), concentrated emulsions (BW) such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions or emulsions, capsule suspensions (CS), oil-or water-based dispersions (SC), suspoemulsions, suspension concentrates, dusts (DP), oil-miscible solutions (OL), seed dressing products, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, granules for soil application or broadcasting, water-soluble granules (SG), water-dispersible granules (WG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes.<br>
These individual formulation types are known in principle and described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kucnler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Engineering], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th Edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg, "Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The formulation auxiliaries which may be required, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives are also known and described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N J., H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte"<br><br>

Based on these formulations, it is also possible to prepare combinations with other substances which act as crop protection agents, such as insecticides, acaricides, herbicides, fungicides, and also with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a readymix or as a tank mix.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which, besides the active substance, also comprise ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (wetting agents, dispersants), for example polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, polyoxyethylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium 2t2,-dinaphthylmethane-6,6,-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate, or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate, in addition to a diluent or inert substance. To prepare the wettable powders, the herbicidally active substances are ground finely, for example in customary apparatus such as hammer mills, blower mills and air-jet mills, and they are simultaneously or subsequently mixed with the formulation auxiliaries.<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared, for example, by dissolving the active substance in an organic solvent such as butanol, cyclohexanone, DMF, or else higher-boiling hydrocarbons such as saturated or unsaturated aliphatics or alicycles, aromatics or mixtures of the organic solvents with the addition of one or more ionic and/or nonionic surfactants (emulsifiers). Examples of substances which can be used as emulsifiers are: calcium alkylarylsulfonates such as calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylarylpolyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide/ethylene oxide condensates, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan esters, such as sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters. Dusts are generally obtained by grinding the active substance with<br><br>
finely divided solid substances, for example talc, natural clays such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, ordiatomaceous earth.<br>
Suspension concentrates can be water- or oil-based. They can be prepared, for example, by wet-grinding using commercially available bead mills with or without addition of surfactants, for example those which have already been mentioned above in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared, for example, by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixers using aqueous organic solvents in the presence or absence of surfactants which have already been mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active substance onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active substance concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material with the aid of binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active substances can also be granulated in the manner which is conventional for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers. As a rule, water-dispersible granules are prepared by the customary processes such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing with high-speed mixers and extrusion without solid inert material.<br>
For the preparation of disk, fluidized-bed, extruder and spray granules see, for example, "Spray-Drying Handbook" 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd., London; J.E. Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 et seq.; "Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook", 5th Ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, p. 8-57.<br>
For further details on the formulation of crop protection products see, for example, G.C. Klingman, "Weed Control as a Science", John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, 1961, pages 81-96 and J.D. Freyer, S.A. Evans, "Weed Control Handbook", 5th Ed.,<br><br>
Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1968, pages 101-103.<br>
As a rule, the agrochemical formulations comprise 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 95% by weight, of active substances of the formulae (II) - (VII) and/or (b) or of the herbicide/antidote mixture of active substances (I) and (II) - (VII) and/or (b) and 1 to 99.9% by weight, in particular 5 to 99.8% by weight, of a solid or liquid additive and 0 to 25% by weight, in particular 0.1 to 25% by weight, of a surfactant.<br>
In wettable powders, the active substance concentration is, for example, approximately 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation components. In the case of emulsifiable concentrates, the active substance concentration is approximately 1 to 80% by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts comprise approximately 1 to 20% by weight of active substances, sprayable solutions approximately 0.2 to 20% by weight of active substances. In the case of granules such as water-dispersible granules, the active substance content depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form. The active substance content of the water-dispersible granules is, as a rule, between 10 and 90% by weight.<br>
Besides this, the abovementioned formulations of active substances comprise, if appropriate, the adhesives, wetters, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze agents, solvents, fillers, carriers, colorants, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors and pH and viscosity regulators which are customary in each case.<br>
Co-components which can be used for the mixtures of herbicides and safeners according to the invention in mixed formulations or in a tank mix are, for example, known active substances as they are described, for example, in Weed Research 26, 441-445 (1986), or 'The Pesticide Manual", 10th edition, The British Crop Protection Council, 1994, and in the literature cited therein. Herbicides which are known from the literature and which can be combined with the mixtures according to the invention are, for example, the following active substances (note: either the common<br><br>

For use, the formulations which are in commercially available form are, if desired, diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, soil granules, granules for broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not diluted any further with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The necessary application rate of the herbicides of the formula (I) varies with the external conditions such as, inter alia, temperature, humidity, and the nature of the herbicide used. It may be varied within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.005 and 5 kg/ha.<br>
The examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention:<br>

Biological examples<br>
1.	Damage scoring<br>
The damage to the plants is evaluated visually in comparison with control plants, according to a scale from 0-100%:<br>
0%     =        no perceptible action in comparison with the untreated plant, 100% =        treated plant dies.<br>
2.	Herbicide action and safener action preemergence<br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous broadleaf weed plants and of crop plants are placed in sandy loam and plastic pots of 9 cm in diameter and are covered with soil. Alternatively, for the test under conditions for paddy rice, broadleaf weeds which occur in rice growing are cultivated in waterlog soil, the amount of water introduced into the pots being such that the water comes up to the soil surface or several millimeters above it. The herbicide/safener active substance combinations of the invention, formulated in the form of emulsifiable concentrates, and, in parallel trials, the correspondingly formulated individual active substances, are then applied to the surface of the covering earth or, in the case of rice, poured into the irrigation water in the form of emulsions, at a water application rate of 300 l/ha (converted), at different concentrations.<br>
Following treatment, the pots are placed in a greenhouse and are kept under good growth conditions. Visual scoring of the plant and/or emergence damage takes place after the trial plants have emerged, after a trial period of 3-4 weeks, in comparison to untreated controls. As the trials show, the herbicidal compositions of the invention have a good preemergence herbicidal action against a broad spectrum of gramineous and broadleaf weeds, with substantial reduction - that is, from around 50% up to 100% less herbicide damage - in damage to crop plants such as corn, rice, wheat or barley or other cereals in comparison with the use of the individual herbicides without safeners.<br>
3.	Herbicide action and safener action postemergence<br><br>
Seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledenous broadleaf weed plants and of crop plants are placed in sandy loam and plastic pots, colorea with soil and grown in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. Alternatively, for the test under conditions for paddy rice, broadleaf weeds that occur in rice growing, and rice, are cultivated in pots in which water stands up to 2 cm above the soil surface, and are cultivated during the growth phase. About three weeks after sowing, the trial plants are treated at the three-leaf stage. The herbicide/safener active substance combinations of the invention, formulated as emulsifable or concentrates, and, in parallel trials, the correspondingly formulated individual active substances are sprayed on the green parts of the plants at different concentrations with a water application rate of 300 l/ha (converted) and, after the trial plants have stood in the greenhouse for 3 weeks under optimum growth conditions, the action of the preparations is scored visually in comparison with untreated controls. In the case of rice or broadleaf weeds which occur in rice growing, the active substances are also introduced directly into the irrigation water (application in analogy to granular application, as it is known) or on plants and sprayed into the irrigation water. In the case of field trials, seeds of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous broadleaf weed plants and of crop plants were placed in sandy loam, covered with earth and grown. Further treatment was as described above. Evaluation in the case took place two weeks after the treatment with herbicide and/or safener. In the case of the trials with sugar cane , evaluation was carried out after 63 days. The experiments show that the herbicidal compositions of the invention exhibit a good postemergence herbicidal action against a broad spectrum of gramineous and broadleaf weeds, with substantial reduction -i.e., around 50% up to 100% less herbicide damage - in damage to crop plants such as sugar cane , corn, rice, wheat or barley or other cereals in comparison with the use of the individual herbicides without safeners.<br>
Table 1 specifies the herbicides used, and table 2 the safeners. Tables 3 to 7 indicate the percentage by which the damage in corn, sugar cane , rice, wheat or barley, respectively, caused by a herbicide is lessened by simultaneous use of the safener.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
