BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This application claims priority lo U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/614,402, filed September 30, 2004. Incorporation by reference of the entire disclosure of the prior application is considered as being part of the disclosure of this application and is hereby incorporated by reference herein.<br>
1.	Field of thejnvention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may relate to phase locked loop circuits.<br>
2.	Background of Related Art<br>
Modern communication device, such as cellular telephones, may employ a phase locked loop device for frequency synthesis of a communication carrier signal modulated with transmission data. The phase locked loop device enables the carrier signal frequency to be precisely controlled and accordingly enables the data on which the carrier signal modulation is based to be reliably transmitted at a stable, known frequency. In such a phase locked loop (PLL) frequency synthesizer, a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) produces the output carrier signal at the desired frequency based on a VCO frequency control signal. In a simplified PLL configuration, this control is achieved by a feedback loop, with the VCO output signal coupled via the feedback loop to a phase-frequency detector which compares the VCO signal phase or frequency to that of a fixed-frequency reference signal and produces a frequency control signal corresponding to the phase difference between the VCO signal and the fixed-frequency signal. This frequency control signal is<br>
 <br>
smoothed by a low pass loop filter and Ihen applied to the VCO such thai in its sieady state the VCO output signal frequency matches that of the fixed-frequency reference signal.<br>
A frequency divider may be included in the PLL feedback loop to enable division of the frequency of the VCO output signal to a frequency that is a multiple of that of a fixed-frequency reference source. The output of the frequency divider is compared by the phase-frequency detector to the fixed-frequency source for controlling the VCO phase. In this way, the frequency of a carrier signal produced by the VCO is constantly controlled such that it is "phase locked" to a multiple of that of the fixed-frequency reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may provide a sigma-della based phase lock loop device that includes a phase frequency detector, a charge pump, a loop filler, a voltage controlled oscillator and a divider circuit. The phase frequency detector may receive a reference signal and a feedback signal and output UP/DOWN signals based on a comparison of the reference signal and the feedback signal. The charge pump may output a charge based on the output signals from the phase frequency detector. The charge pump may include a first current source to apply a fixed amount of current and a second current source to apply a variable amount of current. The voltage controlled oscillator may output a clock signal based on the received charge from the charge pump. The divider circuit may receive the clock signal output from the voltage controlled oscillator and output the feedback signal to the phase frequency detector. A sigma-delta modulator may be coupled to the divider circuit.<br>
 <br>
I ne vanaoie amount or current of the second current source may be based on a phase error of the reference signal and the feedback signal at the phase frequency detector. Further, an amount of the charge output by the charge pump may be linearly proportional lo a phase difference between the reference signal and the feedback signal at the phase frequency detector.<br>
Still further, a magnitude of the first current source may be greater than a magnitude of the second current source. The different magnitudes may provide phase offset at a locked condition of the phase lock loop device.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In the following detailed description, like reference numerals and characters may be used to designate identical, corresponding or similar components in differing figure drawings. Further, in the detailed description to follow, example sizes/models/values/ranges may be given although embodiments of the present invention are not limited to the same. Further, arrangements and embodiments may be shown in block diagram form in order to avoid obscuring the invention, and also in view of the fact that specifics with respect to implementation of such block diagram arrangements may be dependent upon the platform within which the present invention is to be implemented. That is, the specifics may be well within the purview of one skilled in the art. Where specific details are set forth in order to describe example embodiments of the invention, it should be apparent to one skilled in the art that embodiments of the present invention can be practiced without these specific details.<br>
The following discussion may use the terminologies signal(s) and signal line(s) interchangeable with respect to the figures. That is, the terminology signal may correspond to a signal line as shown in the figures. Arrangements and embodiments may also be described with respect to signals being input or output from different circuit components. While the discussion identifies a signal, the signal may be transmitted over a signal line or other type of mechanism. Further, while values or signals may be described as HIGH or LOW and/or UP or DOWN, these descriptions are intended to be relative to the discussed arrangement and/or<br>
 <br>
embodiment. For example, a value or signal may be described as HIGH in one ""arrangement although it may be LOW if provided in another arrangement, such as with a change in logic. The terms HIGH and LOW may be used in an intended generic sense. Embodiments and arrangements may be implemented with a total/partial reversal of the HIGH and LOW signals by a change in logic.<br>
A Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) may be used in wireline and wireless applications to generate a carrier frequency or a timing reference (such as a clock signal). FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a PLL based frequency synthesizer according to an example arrangement. Other arrangements are also possible. More specifically, FIG. 1 shows a PLL that includes a phase frequency detector (PFD) 10, a low-pass filter (LPF) 20 (or loop filler), a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) 30 and a feedback divider circuit 40. The PFD 10 receives a reference signal frer and also receives a feedback signal ffdb from the divider circuit 40. The PFD 10 makes a comparison of the reference signal frer and the feedback signal fab and outputs signals to the VCO 30 through the low pass filter 20. The filtered signal is basically a slowly changing or varying DC signal applied to the VCO 30. The VCO 30 outputs a VCO signal (fout) that may be used as a clocking signal. The VCO output signal foui may also be input to the feedback divider 40, which outputs the feedback signal fflSj to the PFD 10 for comparison with the reference signal frBf.<br>
There may be a trade-off between a loop bandwidth and channel spacing. That is, when an integer-N PLL is used, channel spacing may be the same as a comparison frequency. The loop bandwidth may .be smaller than the comparison frequency by a factor of ten. Since the lock time is inversely proportional to the loop bandwidth, the loop bandwidth may be made smaller to reduce the lock time. In addition to this trade-off, phase noise may also be affected by the loop bandwidth.<br>
 <br>
AS me m-oano pnase noise is reduced by increasing the loop-bandwidth, the phase vioise is also improved by the same factor. However, the restriction of the channel spacing or the frequency resolution of the synthesized output limits the use of the PLL with wide loop bandwidth.<br>
FIG. 2 is a partial diagram of a sigma-delta based PLL according to an example arrangement. Other arrangements are also possible. For ease of illustration, FIG. 2 only shown portions of the sigma-delta based PLL. FIG. 2 does not show the PFD 10, the low pass filter 2O and the VCO 30 that also may form the PLL. The sigma-delta based PLL may have a fast switching time and an arbitrarily small frequency resolution. More specifically, in a sigma-delta based PLL, the divider 40 in the feedback path may be controlled by a sigma-delta modulator 45 for fine frequency resolution. Equation (1) shows a frequency generation equation for a sigma-delta based PLL, such as shown in FIG. 2.<br>
	<br>
The first two values in the parenthesis {i.e., the K and P value) are an integer part of the synthesized frequency and the last values in the parenthesis (i.e., the S, N and D values) are a fractional part of the synthesized frequency. In sigma-delta based PLLs, the value of the denominator in the fractional part is very large and thus the frequency resolution can be increased. Table 1 shows an example for the generation of a frequency using a sigma-delta based PLL.<br>
une prooiem  01 sigma-aeixa oased PLLs are  spurious lones related to (Table Removed)  \nismatches in the PLL. For example, a mismatch of the charge pump and the PFD may produce spurious values thai are similar to the spurs generated from fractional-N synthesizers.<br>
A randomization property of the sigma-delta modulator 45 may become invalid when there is too much mismatch in the charge pump. In this situation, a fractional spur may appear at the output of the VCO and an offset frequency from the carrier frequency may become equal to the fractional part. In order to avoid or minimize the charge pump mismatch, arrangements may match UP and DOWN currents of the charge pump (based on UP/DOWN signals output from the PFD). However, the accuracy of this kind of compensation may not be sufficient because of the measurement accuracy. Simulations show/ that a worst-case mismatch (considering process and environmental variations) may exceed several percents.,<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram of a phase frequency detector (PFD) and a charge pump (CP) according to an example arrangement. FIG. 4 is a graph showing transfer characteristics of the charge pump based on phase difference without a charge pump mismatch (i.e., lnotm=l*norm) according to an example arrangement. FIG. 5 is a graph showing transfer characteristics of the charge pump based on phase difference with a charge pump mismatch (i.e., lnom) ^ rnonn) according to an example arrangement. Other arrangements, graphs and data are also possible.<br>
More specifically, FIG. 3 shows a phase frequency divider (PFD) 110 that receives a reference signal frei and a feedback signal (ffdt) from the VCO (and through the divider circuit 40). The PFD 110 compares the phase of the reference signal frefand the feedback signal fwband outputs an UP signal or a DOWN signal so as to control oscillation of the VCO. The UP signal and the DOWN signal may also<br>
be referred to as UP pulse and UUWN pulse, respectively. FIG. 3 also shows an "WJD gate 130 and a buffer circuit 120 coupled to a RESET input of the PFD 110. The AND gale 130 outputs a signal based on signals on the UP signal line and the DOWN signal line. The buffer circuit 120 provides a delay to prevent any dead zone. The charge pump may include a current source 140, a current source 150, a capacitor 160 and switches 145 and 155. An output terminal 165 of the charge pump may be coupled to the loop filter to provide a charge (or signal) through the loop filler to the VCO. Based on the UP signal applied to the switch 145, the current source 140 may apply a current lup, where lup = Urm- Based on the DOWN signal applied to the switch 155. the current source 150 may apply a current Idown, wherein Idown = l*nonn- The capacitor 160 acts to store a charge that is injected from the current sources 140 and 150, and then the charge may be dumped through the low-pass filter to the VCO. As such, the current injected from the current sources 140 and 150 may depend on the respective UP and DOWN signals output from the PFD<br>
110.	<br>
FIG. 4 shows a situation in which no charge mismatch occurs. This situation represents when lup from the current source 140 is equal to Id0wn from the current source 150. When this occurs, a phase error may not occur at a locked condition and spurious signals may not be generated. Since the net charge transferred to the loop filter should be zero at the locked condition, any phase offset may happen in an opposite direction to cancel out the charge pump mismatch, as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 shows a situation in which a charge pump mismatch occurs, such as when lup from the current source 140 is not equal to ldown from the current source 150. Unlike integer-N synthesizers, a sigma-delta based PLL may change a division factor of the feedback divider 40 and an instantaneous phase of an input of the PFD<br>
liu may vary accoraing to me leeaoack signal f^b from the divider 40. Thus, the imount of phase offsel may be an average phase of the sigma-clella based PL L. In the transfer curve of the PFD 110, the average phase may be a cross-over p»oint, where a nel charge transfer (or Qup-Qdown) becomes zero. A Q value may be defined as Q(charge) = '(current) • t(time). The instantaneous phase from the feedback divider 40 may move back and forth from this centered value.<br>
A PFD having a resel function based on UP and DOWN signals may be called a 3-state PFD. In addition to the inputs being equal, the other stales may include frer leading fwb and frE( lagging ffdb- When the 3-state PFD is used, operation of the PFD and the charge pump may be quite different from a zero phase error. For example, if the phase error is negative or the reference signal fte[ leads the feedback signa I ffdt,, then the DOWN pulse may be fixed in time by a reset delay in the PFD 110. instead, the UP pulse may have the phase difference information. Accordingly, the charge drawn from the loop filter may be fixed per each comparison cycle, while the sourced charge to the loop filter may be varied according to the phase difference of the two input signals. On the olher hand, if the phase error is positive or the feedback signal fidb leads the reference signal fref, then the UP pulse may be fixed in time by the reset delay in the PFD 110. Instead, the DOWN pulse may have the phase difference information. Thus, the charge drawn from the loop filter may be varied according to the phase difference, while the sourced charge to the loop filter may have the fixed amount per each comparison.<br>
Each UP and DOWN pulse may be made to be very linear according to the phase difference determined by the PFD. However, it may be difficult to absolutely match UP and DOWN currents to keep a same slope of the transfer characteristics around a zero phase error. Thus, if a phase offset caused by a charge pump<br>
mismaicn lies wunin a vanaoie operating range of the PFD, the linearity of the ^<br>
FIG. 6 is a timing diagram of signals related to the charge pump and the PFD of FIG. 5 according to an example arrangement. FIG. 6 shows examples of the effect of non-linearity of the charge pump (FIG. 5). Other arrangements, diagrams and data are also possible. Since the UP and DOWN currents have different slopes, a total amount of charge to the loop filter may depend on a sign of a difference between the two current sources 140, 150. The sigma-delta based PLL produces a randomly distributed phase error centered at a locked condition. In the above example, the locked stale may have a non-zero phase error due to imbalance of the charge pump, which may have some offset as shown in FIG. 5. The difference in the slope of the transfer characteristics of FIG. 5 may produce non-linear operation of the charge pump from the breaking point.<br>
The magnitude of the undesired spurious signals in a sigma-delta based PLL may be inversely proportional to linearity of the loop for a full operating range of the PFD. This may mean that there is no need to match the UP current and the DOWN current of the charge pump so as to obtain linearity of the PFD in embodiments of the present invention. FIG. 5 shows that the slope or the linearity of the transfer curve changes at (or in) the operating region of the PFD in sigma-delta based PLLs. In this operating region, the spurious performance may become quite poor and thus unacceptable for some high-end cellular applications.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may provide a linearization technique to reduce spurious tones in sigma-delta based PLLs. Parameters such as a ratio of two charge pump current sources and a reset delay of a PFD may be changed {i.e., increased) to provide better spurious rejection. A zero phase error may be desired<br>
to provioe a low spurious level in an inleger-N based PLL without any mismatch, wowever, in sigma-delta based PLL, the linearity of the charge pump and PFD may be a factor to determine the spurious tone rather than zero phase offset at locked condition. The intentional ratio mismatch of two current sources may increase the linearity and reduce the spurious tones.<br>
FIG. 7 is a graph showing transfer characteristics of a charge pump based on phase difference according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments, graphs and data are also within the scope of the present invention. An operating range (or the phase excursion range) of the PFD may depend on a particular implementation of the sigma delta modulator (such as the sigma-delta modulator 45 shown in FIG. 2} and the loop parameter-like loop bandwidth. There may be no undesired spurious signals if an amount of the charge dumped to the loop filter is linearly proportional to a phase difference between the two PFD input signals (i.e., the reference signal fret and the feedback signal fob). If the charge pump mismatch becomes excessive, then the operating region of the PFD may change as shown in FIG. 7. Unlike the FIG. 5 arrangement, there is no change in slope and thus the linearity of the loop is maintained for all operating regions of the PFD. Thus, the magnitude of the spurious tones may be very small. In Ihis case, the charge dumped to the loop filter may be proportional to the phase difference. When UP and DOWN current mismatch occurs in FIG. 7, the phase offset between two inputs of the PFD may not be zero at the locked condition. However, this may not cause any problem in synthesizer applications because the frequency information may be the only critical factor, not a phase relationship with the reference signal frof.<br>
i. o is a diagram or a pnase frequency detector (PFD) and a charge pump circuit according to an example embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 9 is a liming diagram of signals relating to the charge pump and the PFD of FIG. 8 according lo an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments, configurations and diagrams are also within the scope of the present invention. FIG. 8 shows a PFD and a charge pump. Other elements (such as the VCO, the feedback divider and the sigma-delta modulator) are not shown in FIG. 8 for ease of illustration.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may linearize operation of a sigma-delta based PLL. The UP and DOWN currents of the charge pump may have different magnitudes (as shown in FIG. 8) to provide sufficient phase offset at a locked state (as shown in FIG. 7). For example, a constant multiplication factor of K (in FIG. 8) may be used as a design parameter for either the UP current source or the DOWN current source. The multiplication factor may be large enough to provide linear operation of the PFD (as shown in FIG. 7). The K value may have been previously (or originally) built into the PLL or the K value may be controllable by a control device.<br>
More specifically, FIG. 8 shows the phase frequency divider (PFD) 110 that receives the reference signal fret and the feedback signal f^b from the VCO (and through the divider circuit 40). Similar to that discussed above, the PFD 110 compares the phase of the reference signal frei and the feedback signal ffdb and outputs an UP signal and/or a DOWN signal so as to control oscillation of the VCO. FIG. 8 also shows the AND gate 130 and the buffer circuit 120 coupled to a RESET input of the PFD 110 in a similar manner as discussed above with respect to FIG. 3. The charge pump may include a current source 170, the current source 150, the<br>
capacitor 160 and switches 175 and 155. The output terminal 165 may be coupled lo the loop filter to provide a charge (or signal) through the loop filter to the VCO. Based on the UP signal applied to the switch 175, the current source 170 may apply a current lupl where lup = K • Inarm- Based on the DOWN signal applied to the switch 155, the current source 150 may apply a current Idown, where Idovm = l*norm. The capacitor 160 acts to store a charge that is injected from the current sources 170 and 150, and then the charge may be dumped through the low-pass filter to the VCO. As such, the current injected from the current sources 170 and 150 may depend on the respective UP and DOWN signals output from the PFD 110.<br>
Stated differently, in FIG. 8, the UP current may be increased to shift a crossover point far from the zero phase error as may be seen by comparing FIG. 3 and FIG. 7. In embodiments of the present invention, the phase error during the operation of the PLL may be negative and thus the DOWN current may have phase error information. The UP current may be fixed in time by the reset delay in the PFD 110 and thus an amount of charge supplied to the loop filter from the charge pump may also be fixed per each comparison.<br>
Since the PFD 110 and portions of the charge pump current can be made to have very linear operation, spurious characteristics resulting from this embodiment may be superior to disadvantageous arrangements. In other words, one of the UP and DOWN current sources may provide a fixed amount of charge for each comparison cycle, and the other current source may provide a variable amount of charge proportional to the phase error. There may be another source of error caused by the glitch and some transient due to the switching action of the charge pump circuit. Also, the amount of glitch may be quite different for the switches in the UP and DOWN current sources. The phase shifting may also help the non-linearity<br>
caused by this kind ot glitch, because one of two current sources has constant operating condition.<br>
FIG. 9 is a timing diagram showing operations of the PFD based on FIGs. 7 and 8. Due to the large intentional mismatch in the UP and DOWN current sources 170 and 150, the DOWN current source 150 may provide a variable amount of charge to the loop filter, whereas the pulse width of the UP current source 170 may be fixed in time. Accordingly, the linearity of the net charge to the loop filter may be guaranteed.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a phase frequency detector and a charge pump according to an example embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 11 is a graph showing transfer characteristics of the charge pump based on phase difference according to an example embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 12 is a timing diagram of signals related to the charge pump and the PFD of FIG. 10 according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Other embodiments, configurations, and diagrams are also within the scope of the present invention.<br>
More specifically, FIG. 10 shows the phase frequency divider (PFD) 110 that receives the reference frequency signal fref and the feedback signal f^b from the VCO. Similar to that discussed above, the PFD 110 compares the phase of the reference signal fter and the feedback signal fob and outputs an UP signal and/or a DOWN signal so as to control oscillation of the VCO. FIG. 10 also shows the AND gate 130 and the buffer circuit 120 coupled to a RESET input of the PFD 110 in a similar manner as discussed above with respect to FIG. 3. The charge pump may include the current source 140, a current source 180, the capacitor 160 and switches 145 and 185. The output terminal 165 of the charge pump may be coupled jto the loop filter to provide a charge (or signal) through the loop filter to the VCO. Based on<br>
the UP signal applied to the switch 145, the current source 140 may apply a current acts to store a charge that is injected from the current sources 140 and 180, and then the charge may be dumped through the low-pass filter to the VCO. As such, the current injected from the current sources 140 and 180 may depend on the respective UP and DOWN signals output from the PFD 110.<br>
Slated differently, FIG. 10 shows an embodiment that changes the UP current and DOWN current as compared to disadvantageous arrangements so that linearization may be provided. FIG. 10 shows a large DOWN current source 180 related to the constant multiplication factor K. FIG. 11 shows the transfer characteristics when the DOWN current is increased. In this embodiment, the operating range of the sigma-delta based PLL is shifted to a positive phase error. Accordingly, the phase error is positive and only the UP current has phase error information. The DOWN current may be fixed by the reset delay and an amount of the sinking current may be fixed in each comparison as shown in FIG. 12.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may provide a sigma-delta based PLL that includes a PFD, a charge pump and a VCO. The charge pump may output a charge based on UP and DOWN signal output from the PFD. The charge pump may include a first current source to apply a fixed amount of current and a second current source to apply a variable amount of current. The variable amount of current may be based on a phase error (or phase difference) between input signals of the PFD. An amount of charge output by the charge pump may be linearly proportional to a phase difference of the two input signals of the PFD. Additionally, a magnitude of<br>
the first current source may be greater than a magnitude of the  second current<br>
