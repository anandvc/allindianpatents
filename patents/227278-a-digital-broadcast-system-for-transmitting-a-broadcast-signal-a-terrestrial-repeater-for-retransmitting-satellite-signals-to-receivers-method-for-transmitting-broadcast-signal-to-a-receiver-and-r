				<td>The present insertion relates to a digital broadcast system and method for<br>
transmitting broadcast signal, terresterial repeater, and receiver for receiving broadcast<br>
signal. This application is divided from Indian Patent Application No. 805/CAL/98<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "parent application").<br>
Field of Invention<br>
A digital broadcast system is provided which uses a satellite direct radio<br>
broadcast system having different downlink options in combination with a terrestrial<br>
repeater network employing different re-broadcasting options to achieve high<br>
availability reception by mobile radios, static radios and portable radios in urban areas,<br>
suburban metropolitan areas, rural areas, including geographically open areas and<br>
geographic areas characterized by terrain having high elevations.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Receivers in existing systems which provide digital audio radio service (DARS)<br>
have been radically effected by multipath effects which create severe degradations in<br>
signal quality, such as signal fading and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Fading effects<br>
on broadcast channels to receivers can be sensitive to frequency, particularly in an urban<br>
environment or geographic areas with high elevations where blockage of line of sight<br>
(LOS) signals from satellites is most prevalent. Locations directly beneath a satellite<br>
(hereinafter referred to as the sub-satellite point) inherently have the highest elevation<br>
angles, while locations that depart from the sub-satellite point inherently have<br>
decreasing elevation angles and, accordingly, an increase of the earth center angle<br>
subtended between the sub-satellite point and the reception location. Locations that are<br>
near the sub-satellite point typically enjoy virtually unblocked LOS reception. Thus,<br>
the need for terrestrial reinforcement of potentially blocked LOS signals is minimal.<br>
When the LOS elevation angle to the satellite becomes less than about 85 degrees,<br>
however, blockage by tall buildings or geological elevations (i.e., on the order of 30<br>
meters) becomes significant. Terrestrial re-radiation for gap filling is needed to achieve<br>
satisfactory coverage for mobile radios, static radios, as well as portable radios. In areas<br>
where the heights of buildings or geological sites are relatively low (i.e., on the order of<br>
less than 10 meters), the blockage is not significant until the LOS elevation angle is<br>
lower than 75 degrees. Thus, at the mid-latitude and high latitude locations within the<br>
coverages of one or more broadcast satellites, terrestrial re-radiation is needed to achieve<br>
suitable radio reception. A need exists for fully satisfactory radio reception that<br>
combines satellite LOS transmission and terrestrial re-radiation of a satellite downlink<br>
signal waveform.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a digital broadcast<br>
system (DBS) is provided which overcomes a number of disadvantages associated with<br>
existing broadcast systems and realizes a number of advantages. The DBS of the present<br>
invention comprises a TDM carrier satellite delivery system for digital audio broadcasts<br><br>
(DAB) which is combined with a network of terrestrial repeaters for the re-radiation of<br>
satellite downlink signals toward radio receivers.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a single<br>
geostationary satellite transmits downlink signals which can be received by radio<br>
receivers in the LOS of the satellite signal, as well as by terrestrial repeaters. Each<br>
terrestrial repeater is configured to recover the digital baseband signal from the satellite<br>
signal and modulate the signal using multicarrier modulation (MCM) for retransmission<br>
toward radio receivers. Radio receivers are configured to receive both a quadrature<br>
phase shift keyed (QPSK) modulated TDM bit stream, as well as an MCM stream.<br>
Radio receivers are programmed to select a broadcast channel demodulated from the<br>
TDM bit stream and the MCM bit stream, and to select the broadcast channel recovered<br>
with the least errors using a diversity combiner.<br>
In accordance with still another aspect of the present invention, a DBS system is<br>
provided which comprises two geostationary satellites in combination with a network<br>
of terrestrial repeaters. The terrestrial repeaters are configured to process satellite<br>
downlink signals to achieve the baseband satellite signal and to modulate the signal<br>
using MCM. Radio receivers are configured to implement a diversity decision logic to<br>
select from among three diversity signals, including the two satellite signals and the<br>
MCM signal. Each radio receiver employs maximum likelihood combining of two LOS<br>
satellite signals with switch combining between the terrestrial re-radiated signal, or<br>
MCM signal, and the output of the maximum likelihood combiner.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a broadcast channel<br>
may be selected from the three diversity signals by using maximum likelihood<br>
combining of all three signals, that is, early and late LOS satellite signals and the MCM<br>
signal from the terrestrial repeater.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a digital broadcasting system for transmitting a<br>
broadcast signal, said broadcast signal being transmitted from an earth station, comprising : a satellite for<br>
receiving said broadcast signal from said earth station and for transmitting a satellite signal comprising<br>
said broadcast signal on a first carrier frequency; and a terrestrial repeater for receiving said satellite signal<br>
and for generating and transmitting a terrestrial signal from said satellite signal comprising said broadcast<br>
signal on a second carrier frequency that is different from said first carrier frequency to enable a radio<br>
receiver configured to receive said satellite signal and said terrestrial signal to employ diversity combining<br>
to generate an output signal from at least one of said satellite signal and said terrestrial signal, said<br>
terrestrial signal being modulated by said terrestrial repeater in accordance with a multipath-tolerant<br>
modulation technique.<br>
The present invention further provides a terrestrial repeater for retransmitting satellite signals to<br>
radio receivers comprising : a terrestrial receiver for receiving said satellite signals ; and a terrestrial<br>
waveform modulator for generating terrestrial signals from said satellite signals, said terrestrial signals<br>
being modulated by said terrestrial waveform modulator in accordance with multicarrier modulation ;<br>
wherein said satellite signals are transmitted from a satellite using a first carrier frequency, and said<br>
terrestrial waveform modulator is operable to transmit said terrestrial signals to said radio receivers using a<br>
second carrier frequency that is different from said first carrier frequency to enable said radio receivers to<br>
employ diversity combining to generate an output signal from at least one of said satellite signals and said<br>
terrestrial signals.<br>
The present invention also provides a receiver for receiving a broadcast signal in a combined<br>
satellite and terrestrial digital broadcasting system, comprising : a first receiver arm for receiving a first<br>
satellite signal transmitted from a first satellite on a first carrier frequency, said first satellite signal<br>
comprising said broadcast signal and being modulated in accordance with at least one of time division<br>
multiplexing and code division multiplexing, said first receiver arm comprising a demodulator for<br>
recovering said broadcast signal; a second receiver arm for receiving a terrestrial signal transmitted from<br>
a terrestrial station on a second carrier frequency, said terrestrial signal being generated at the terrestrial<br>
station from a received said broadcast signal that has been modulated in accordance with at least one of<br><br>
adaptive equalized time division multiplexing, coherent frequency hopping adaptive equalized time<br>
division multiplexing, code division multiplexing and multicarrier modulation prior to transmission via<br>
said second carrier frequency, said second receiver arm comprising a demodulator for recovering said<br>
broadcast signal ; and a combiner for generating an output signal from at least one of said first satellite<br>
signal and said terrestrial signal.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 depicts a digital broadcast system (DBS) 10 comprising at least one<br>
geostationary satellite 12 for line of sight (LOS) satellite signal reception at radio<br>
receivers indicated generally at 14. Another geostationary satellite 16 at a different<br>
orbital position can be provided for time and/or spatial diversity purposes as discussed<br>
below in connection with Figs. 6 and 7. The system 10 further comprises at least one<br>
terrestrial repeater 18 for retransmission of satellite signals in geographic areas 20 where<br>
LOS reception is obscured by tall buildings, hills and other obstructions. The radio<br>
receiver 14 is preferably configured tor dual-mode operation to receive both satellite<br>
signals and terrestrial signals and to select one of the signals as the receiver output.<br>
As stated previously, the present invention relates to a DBS 10 for optimized<br>
static, portableand mobile radio reception. In accordance with the present invention,<br>
the DBS 10 combines line-of-sight (LOS) reception of satellite waveforms that are<br>
optimized for satellite delivery with re-radiation of the LOS signal from the satellite 12<br>
or 16 via one or more terrestrial repeaters 18. The terrestrial repeaters 18 use other<br>
waveforms which are optimized for terrestrial delivery where blockage of the satellite<br>
LOS signal occurs. LOS signal blockage caused by buildings, bridges, trees and other<br>
obstructions typically occurs in urban centers and suburban areas. Waveforms<br>
particularly suitable for LOS satellite transmission are Time Division Multiplex (TDM)<br>
and Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA). Waveforms particularly suitable for<br>
overcoming terrestrial multipath interference encountered in blocked urban areas are<br>
Adaptive Equalized TDM (AETDM), Coherent Frequency Hopping Adaptively<br>
Equalized TDM (CFHATDM) and Multiple Carrier Modulation (MCM).<br>
Frequency hopping is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,283,780, to Schuchman et<br>
al, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference. When a terrestrial repeater 18<br>
employs AETDM, radio receivers 14 are provided with an equalizer (not shown). For<br>
AETDM, a TDM bit stream is received, from the satellite 12 or 16. The bit stream is<br>
converted into a new TDM bit stream into which training sequences are inserted by a<br>
process called puncturing. Puncturing replaces a small traction of the TDM data bits<br>
with the training sequences. The number of bits punctured is so small that the errors<br>
thereby produced are correctable at the receiver by forward error correction. The new<br><br>
TDM bit stream is QPSK-modulated by the repeater onto a radio frequency (RF) carrier<br>
that is transmitted at high power into the multipath environment of a central city<br>
business district, for example. This transmitted signal is received by a receiver 14<br>
equipped with an adaptive time domain equalizer. By using the training sequences, it<br>
can adjust the taps of an inverse multipath processor to cause the various multipath<br>
arrival components to add constructively. The signal thus reconstructed is next<br>
processed to recover the bits of the TDM stream with high accuracy. The forward<br>
error correction available in the receiver 14 corrects both the errors introduced by the<br>
puncturing and those caused by thermal noise and receiver impairments.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the combination of a<br>
satellite-efficient LOS waveform and terrestrial multipath interference-tolerant<br>
waveform in a DBS system is the optimum means for achieving high availability<br>
reception by mobile radios, static radios and portable radios in urban areas, suburban<br>
areas and in rural areas. For example, in accordance with an embodiment of the present<br>
invention illustrated in Figs. 2-9, an MCM signal is sent from a network of terrestrial<br>
repeaters 18 deployed to cover a blocked area with high reception availability. The<br>
signaling techniques described in connection with the present invention are applicable<br>
over the electromagnetic wave frequency range from 200 to 3000 MHz to facilitate the<br>
combination of LOS satellite radiation with terrestrial re-radiation of the signal received<br>
from the satellite 12 or 16.<br>
Optimal satellite waveforms permit very efficient transformation of solar power,<br>
which is collected by the solar arrays of the satellites 12 and 16 into radiated radio<br>
frequency power. These waveforms are characterized by a low peak-to-average power<br>
ratio (i.e., crest factor), thereby permitting operation of high power amplifiers that feed<br>
the satellite earth-pointing antennas at or near the maximum power output and<br>
therefore the most efficient power output. A TDM waveform is particularly useful for<br>
permitting operation within a few tenths of a dB of maximum power output. A CDMA<br>
waveform that uses properly selected codes allows operation at approximately 2 to 4 dB<br>
below maximum power output. Because the MCM waveform is composed of the sum of<br>
hundreds ot pnase modulated sinusoids, as described below with reference to Fig. 3, the<br>
MCM waveform inherently possesses a high peak-to-average ratio. Consequently, a<br><br>
MCM waveform encounters significantly greater amplitude and phase intermodulation<br>
distortion in the satellite's high power amplifier. To achieve acceptable reception by an<br>
LOS satellite receiver, a MCM waveform is backed in the high power amplifier and<br>
allocated a receiver implementation impairment of at least 6 dB on the down-link<br>
budget, as compared with a quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) TDM waveform.<br>
This translates to a 4-to-1 reduction in satellite power conversion, rendering the MCM<br>
waveform an unsuitable choice for satellite LOS delivery on a DBS 10. Regarding the<br>
ATDM and CFHATDM waveforms, these waveform are specifically designated to<br>
combat terrestrial multipath and are not intended for, nor are they efficient for satellite<br>
LOS delivery.<br>
Regarding terrestrial reinforcement by re-radiation of the satellite LOS signal<br>
from a terrestrial repeater, for example, a TDM waveform is not suitable because its<br>
reception is severely impaired by multipath effects. Furthermore, some proposed<br>
systems which use CDMA waveforms for reinforcement repeat the same program signal<br>
using one CDMA channel code for LOS satellite delivery and another CDMA channel<br>
code for terrestrial re-radiated delivery on carriers that occupy the same frequency<br>
bandwidth. Reception is achieved by means of adaptive rake receivers. These proposed<br>
CDMA systems are disadvantageous because an annulus zone occurs in which reception<br>
is not possible between the region where the reinforcement signal can be received and<br>
the region where the satellite LOS signal can be received. Receivers 14 in the annulus<br>
are not able to receive the terrestrial re-radiated signal because the signal power level<br>
falls below a receiver threshold for that signal. These receivers 14 are also not able to<br>
receive the satellite LOS signal because there remains sufficient re-radiated signal to jam<br>
LOS satellite reception. Thus, these receivers 14 in the annulus must move far enough<br>
away from the zone of re-radiation to decrease the re-radiated signal power to below the<br>
threshold of jamming; otherwise, LOS satellite reception is not possible.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the CDMA<br>
waveform is adapted to make possible its use for simultaneous delivery via satellite LOS<br>
and via terrestrial re-radiation. The CDMA channel codes are assigned for each delivery<br>
to different RP carriers. The orthogonality thereby created permits the two signals (i.e.,<br><br>
the satellite LOS signal and the terrestrial repeater signal) to be separated by RF/IF<br>
filtering in the radio receiver.<br>
The identification of workable and unworkable waveform combinations for<br>
accomplishing terrestrial reinforcement of satellite LOS reception in accordance with<br>
the present invention are listed in the TABLE 1.<br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
AETDM waveforms can be satisfactorily implemented and operated in<br>
multipath environments characterized by signal propagation delays as long as 20<br>
microseconds (µs). Care must be exercised to ensure that signal arrivals from distant<br>
repeaters 18 do not exceed this bound. The adaptively equalized re-radiated waveform<br>
can be received by radio receivers 14 designed to use the parent non-equalized TDM<br>
waveform when the former does not exhibit severe multipath. This compatibility<br>
prevents obsolescence of direct LOS non-equalized TDM radios when the AETDM re-<br>
radiation is turned on.<br>
The CFHATDM waveform can be satisfactorily implemented and operated in<br>
multipath environments characterized by delays as long as 65 µs. Care must be exercised<br>
to ensure that signal arrivals from distant repeaters 18 do not exceed this bound. The<br><br>
waveform cannot be received by radio receivers 14 designed to use the parent non-<br>
equalized TDM waveform.<br>
The MCM waveform can be satisfactorily implemented and operated in<br>
multipath environments characterized by delays as long as 65 µs. The maximum delay is<br>
affected by the guard time assignment given to the waveform's periodic symbol period<br>
assignment. Care must be exercised to ensure that signal arrivals from distant repeaters<br>
18 do not exceed this bound. The waveform cannot be received by radio receivers 14<br>
designed to use the parent non-equalized TDM waveform.<br>
The CDMA waveform can be satisfactorily implemented and operated in<br>
multipath environments characterized by delays determined by the span of the time<br>
delays implemented in the rake paths at the receivers 14. Care must be exercised to<br>
ensure that all signal arrivals from distant repeaters 18, multipath reflections and<br>
different satellites do not exceed this bound. The waveform cannot be received by radio<br>
receivers 14 designed to use the parent non-equalized TDM waveform.<br>
The satellite signals can be transmitted from one satellite 12 or 16 or from two<br>
satellites 12 and 16. Use of two geostationary satellites 12 and 16 sufficiently separated<br>
in their orbits creates diversity in the LOS elevation and azimuth angles to enhance<br>
signal reception availability. Also, time diversity achieved by repeating a satellite signal<br>
from a single satellite 12 or 16, or by transmitting a signal from two satellites 12 and 16<br>
with the properly selected time difference, further enhances the reception availability.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a<br>
waveform comprising multiple channel TDM with QPSK, Offset QPSK, Differential<br>
QPSK, Differentially Coded QPSK, or Minimum Shift Keyed (MSK) modulation is<br>
used for the transmission of signals from a satellite for LOS reception by a radio<br>
receiver 14. Terrestrial re-radiation is preferably implemented using an MCM<br>
waveform designed to carry a TDM bit stream of a capacity of up to 3.68 Mbit/s.<br>
MCM is preferably implemented which creates between 400 and 1200 multiple carriers<br>
by means of an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform as described below in connection with<br>
Fig. 3, resulting in a symbol period between 200 and 300 µs. A guard interval of<br>
between 55 to 65 microseconds is included in each symbol period. The MCM<br>
waveform is designed to accommodate Doppler carrier frequency shifts among<br><br>
multipath components occurring simultaneously. Puncturing is preferably used to<br>
eliminate bits or pairs of bits from the TDM bit stream to reduce the rate to a value of<br>
between 70% to 80% of the 3.68 Mbit/s rate. A special symbol is inserted between each<br>
of a selected number of FFT-generated symbols periods to provide a means to recover<br>
symbol period timing and carrier frequency synchronization . In the receiver 14, a<br>
Viterbi soft decision trellis decoder is preferably implemented to re-establish the bits or<br>
bit pairs punctured at the repeater 18, as well as all other bits transmitted, by use of an<br>
erasure technique. In this technique, the decoder simply ignores the bits in locations<br>
known to have been punctured at the repeater 18.<br>
TDM carrier satellite delivery of the DBS 10 is discussed in U.S. Patent<br>
Specification No. 6,201,798,— the entire subject matter of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Briefly, with reference to Fig. 2, the<br>
broadcast segment 22 preferably includes encoding of a broadcast channel into a 3.68<br>
Megabits per second (Mbps) time division multiplex (TDM) bit stream, as indicated in<br>
block 26. The TDM bit stream comprises 96 16 kilobits per second (kbps) prime rate<br>
channels and additional information for synchronization, demultiplexing, broadcast<br>
channel control and services. Broadcast channel encoding preferably involves MPEG<br>
audio coding, forward error correction (FEC) and multiplexing. The resulting TDM<br>
bit stream is modulated using quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation, as<br>
shown in block 28, prior to transmission via a satellite uplink 30.<br>
TDM satellite delivery achieves the greatest satellite on-board payload efficiency<br>
possible in terms of the conversion of solar power to electromagnetic wave power. This<br>
is because single TDM carrier per tube operation permits each satellite traveling wave<br>
tube to operate at its saturated power output, which is its most efficient operating point.<br>
The TDM carrier in a typical application is designed to deliver 96 prime bit rate<br>
increments, each bearing 16 kbit/s, to small, economical radio receivers 14 located in<br>
the beams of the satellite 12 or 16. From one to eight prime rate increments are<br>
grouped to constitute a broadcast channel. A broadcast channel can be divided into a<br>
number of service channels for delivery of audio, video, data and multimedia.<br>
The power density delivered to the earth by TDM carriers from satellites 12 and<br>
16 can made very high and hence provide excellent LOS reception by radio receivers 14<br><br>
in automobiles and trucks when traveling on open highways in the country side and in<br>
suburban areas. However, in urban areas where tall buildings abound, or in forests<br>
where tall towering damp foliage trees abound, LOS reception is blocked, thus<br>
inhibiting suitable operation of the receiver 14 for LOS reception. Attempting to<br>
overcome these conditions by raising the satellite power is both excessively expensive<br>
and technically impractical. Accordingly, a more practical alternative is to augment the<br>
direct LOS satellite reception by adding a network of terrestrial repeaters 18.<br>
Concerning the nature of the blockage of LOS reception consider the following.<br>
Locations directly beneath the satellite 12 or 16 (i.e., the sub-satellite point) inherently<br>
have the highest elevation angles, while locations that depart from the sub-satellite point<br>
inherently have decreasing elevation angles and an increase of the earth center angle<br>
subtended between the sub-satellite location and the reception location. Receivers 14 at<br>
locations that are near the sub-satellite point are permitted virtually unblocked LOS<br>
reception and the need for terrestrial reinforcement is minimal. However, when the<br>
LOS elevation angle to the satellite becomes less than about 85 degrees, blockage by tall<br>
buildings (i.e., &gt;30 m) becomes significant. Accordingly, terrestrial re-radiation for<br>
gap-filling is needed to achieve satisfactory coverage for mobile radio receivers. In areas<br>
where building heights are low (e.g., 
LOS elevation angle is lower than 75 degrees. At the mid-latitude and high latitude<br>
locations within the 6 degree beam width coverages of the satellites 12 and 16, terrestrial<br>
re-radiation of the TDM waveform is needed to achieve suitable mobile reception.<br>
Thus, fully satisfactory mobile reception requires a system that combines satellite LOS<br>
and terrestrial re-radiation of the satellite waveform.<br>
The DBS 10 of the present invention re-radiates the LOS satellite signal from a<br>
multiplicity of terrestrial repeaters 18 which are judiciously spaced and deployed within<br>
the central part of a city, as well as in metropolitan areas and suburban areas, to achieve<br>
maximum coverage. This type of deployment is a recognized art for terrestrial digital<br>
audio broadcast (DAB) and cell telephone systems, and can be extended in accordance<br>
with the present invention to terrestrial re-radiation of the TDM satellite LOS signal.<br>
The deployment utilizes a mix of radiated power levels (EIRP) ranging from as little as<br>
1 to 10 watts for short range fill-in repeaters 18 (out to 1 km radius) to as great as 100 to<br><br>
10,000 watts for re-radiators or repeaters having wide area coverage (from 1 km to 10<br>
km radius).<br>
Two preferred embodiments for a DBS 10 having a satellite-LOS/terrestrial-re-<br>
radiation configuration are described below. The first embodiment involves one<br>
geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite 12 or 16 having a judiciously selected longitude along<br>
the GSO arc which operates in coordination with a network of the terrestrial repeaters<br>
18. The second embodiment involves two satellites 12 and 16 having different<br>
judiciously spaced GSO longitudes to achieve space and time diversity.<br>
The embodiment for a DBS 10 using one GSO satellite 12 with at least one<br>
terrestrial repeater 18 is shown in Fig. 2 for illustrative purposes. For each terrestrial<br>
repeater 18, the LOS satellite signal is received by an antenna 32 operating in<br>
conjunction with a radio receiver 34 to demodulate and recover the digital baseband<br>
signal from the signal radiated from the satellite 12. The digital baseband signal is<br>
supplied to a terrestrial waveform modulator 36 that generates a waveform which is<br>
judiciously designed to make possible the recovery of the digital baseband signal after<br>
the waveform has been transmitted from the terrestrial repeater 18 and received by a<br>
radio receiver 14. The modulated waveform is then frequency translated to a carrier<br>
frequency and amplified, as indicated by block 38. The terrestrial re-radiated waveform<br>
is specifically chosen to withstand the dynamic multipath encountered over the<br>
terrestrial path between the transmitter antenna 40 and the receiver 14. This multipath<br>
is caused by reflections and diffractions from and around obstacles such as buildings 44<br>
and terrain and from troposphere wavebending and reflections.<br>
The antenna 32 is designed to have high gain (&gt; 10dBi) toward the satellite 12,<br>
while achieving low gain in other directions such that the LOS signal is received with<br>
low interference and consequently very high quality (i.e. error rate 
demodulator and other reception elements in the receiver 34 are those designed for the<br>
LOS radio receivers 14 used in the DBS 10 and described in the aforementioned<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,201,798. The radio receivers 18 are<br>
designed to receive the 3.68 Mbit/s QPSK modulated TDM bit stream. As stated<br>
previously, the digital baseband is preferably a 3.68 Mbit/s digital waveform TDM bit<br>
stream that carries 96 16 kbit/s prime bit rate digital channels organized into broadcast<br><br>
channels, and side information needed to synchronize, demultiplex and control the<br>
broadcast channels and the services they bare. The terrestrial waveform modulator 36<br>
and the waveform that it generates is designed to allow reception unimpeded by the<br>
multipath vagaries indicated at 42 of the terrestrial path as described previously.<br>
Possible multipath-tolerant waveforms are adaptive equalized TDM, adaptive equalized<br>
multiple carrier frequency hoppers with adaptive equalization, Fast Fourier Transform<br>
multiple carrier modulation and CDMA with rake receivers. The repeater 18 is<br>
equipped to assemble the multipath-tolerant waveform, to frequency convert the<br>
waveform to the desired re-radiator transmitter RF frequency at the selected power<br>
level via the RF translator 38, and to radiate the waveform from antenna 40. The<br>
antenna 40 is preferably configured to provide omni-directional or sector directional<br>
propagation in the horizontal plane and high directive toward the horizon. The net<br>
antenna gain is expected to range from 10 to 16 dBi. The antenna 40 can be located on<br>
top of a building and/or on a tower at a desired height. As previously mentioned, the<br>
radiated power level can range from 1 to 10,000 watts of EIRP depending on the<br>
application.<br>
A particularly desirable multipath-tolerant re-radiated waveform uses<br>
multicarrier modulation (MCM). The manner in which the waveform is generated is<br>
shown in Fig. 3. A digital stream such as the 3.68 Mbit/s TDM stream is time-domain-<br>
divided into a number of parallel paths (block 102), for example, 460 parallel paths with<br>
each parallel path carrying 8000 bits per second. The bits on each of these paths are<br>
paired into 2 bit symbols with one bit identified as the I (imaginary) component and the<br>
other as the Q (Real) component of a complex number. This creates a complex symbol<br>
rate of 4000 per second. These bits are fed as 460 parallel complex number frequency<br>
coefficient inputs to a Discrete Inverse Fourier Transform converter implemented using<br>
a 512 coefficient Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (EFFT) 104. It is well known in the<br>
current state of the art that the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm must operate with 2n<br>
input and output coefficients where n is any integer. Thus, for n = 9, 29 = 512. Since<br>
the number of coefficients is 460, the remaining 52 missing input coefficients are set<br>
equal to zero. This is done by assigning 23 zero-valued coefficients at each the<br>
uppermost and lower most IFFT inputs, thus leaving the 460 center coefficients assigned<br><br>
to non-zero values. The output 104 of the IFFT is a set of 460 QPSK-modulated,<br>
orthogonal sine coefficients which constitute 460 narrow band orthogonal carriers, each<br>
supporting a symbol rate of 4000 per second and consequently having a symbol period<br>
of 250 µs. No carriers appear at the output of the IFFT 104 for the coefficients that are<br>
set equal to zero.<br>
The IFFT multicarrier output 104 is further processed to create a guard interval<br>
105 for the set of 460 complex symbol narrow band orthogonal carriers (block 106). It<br>
is assumed that a fraction f of a symbol period Ts is to be allocated to guard time. To do<br>
this the symbol duration must be reduced to a value Ts = (1-f) Ts. For the example<br>
considered above Ts = 250 µs. If 25 % of the symbol time is to be allocated guard time,<br>
then f =0.25 and Ts = 187.5 µs. To do this, the symbol period output of the IFFT is<br>
stored in a memory every 250 µs and then played back in 187.5 µs. To fill the 250 µs<br>
symbol interval, the first samples of the IFFT output are again played back during the<br>
62.5 µs guard interval. This procedure causes an increase in the bandwidth of the<br>
multicarrier output by a multiplication of (l-f)-l. Thus, the bandwidth needed for the<br>
multicarrier modulator output is multiplied by 1.33 to a value of 4000 x 460 x 1.33 =<br>
2.453 MHz.<br>
Finally, to complete the multicarrier modulator processing, a symbol 106<br>
containing a synchronization symbol is introduced periodically, as indicated by block<br>
108. This is done to provide the means for synchronizing a sampling window of 187.5<br>
µs duration at the receiver 14 to the center of the group of multipath arrivals every 250<br>
µs. Also, a phase reference symbol for differential reference coding of the symbol<br>
information is also added periodically. The synchronization and phase reference<br>
symbols are preferably introduced every 20 to 100 symbol periods depending on the<br>
design requirements.<br>
An additional feature of the modulation design is to puncture the TDM digital<br>
bit stream, as indicated by phantom block 110, at the input to the modulator 36 to<br>
reduce the final bandwidth of the multicarrier waveform. Puncturing means selective,<br>
sparse elimination of real data bits from the data stream applied at the input to the IFFT<br>
104. This can be done for a fraction of the bits of the stream in anticipation that the<br>
forward error correction scheme applied at the receiver 14 will simply treat the<br><br>
punctured bits as errors and correct them. This has the consequence of increasing the<br>
signal to noise ratio (Eb/No) for a desired reception BER objective by 1 to 3 dB,<br>
depending on the fraction of bits removed by the puncturing. The design for the<br>
punctured waveform proportionately reduces the bandwidth of the multicarrier<br>
modulation. For example, if the bit rate of the TDM stream is reduced by 75% , the<br>
bandwidth will also be reduced by 75%. For the example previously given, the bit rate<br>
is reduced to 2.76 Mbit/s and the multicarrier bandwidth to 1.84 MHz. Such bandwidth<br>
compression can be necessary in applications where the available frequency spectrum<br>
would otherwise be insufficient to carry the desired capacity.<br>
It is to be understood that the terrestrial repeater described with reference to<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 is used to recover a TDM satellite downlink signal, and to demodulate and<br>
reformat the TDM signal via baseband processing into a different waveform using, for<br>
example, CDMA, AETDM, MCM or CFIFATDM. It is to be understood, however,<br>
that the DBS 10 can comprise terrestrial repeaters 18 which are co-channel or non-co-<br>
channel repeaters. For example, terrestrial repeaters 18 can be provided which are co-<br>
channel gap-fillers which merely amplify and repeat a received satellite signal on the<br>
same carrier as the satellite signal. Alternatively, terrestrial repeaters can be provided<br>
which are non-co-channel gap-fillers which amplify and repeat a satellite signal on a<br>
different carrier frequency via frequency translation. In either case, baseband processing<br>
of the satellite signal is not performed at the repeater. These types of gap-fillers can be<br>
used, for example, indoors (Fig. 10) or along a roadway (Fig. 11).<br>
At a radio receiver 14 shown in Fig. 4, the multicarrier modulated RF waveform<br>
is received by the antenna 201 operating in conjunction with a low noise RF front end<br>
202, mixer 203, local oscillator 204, first intermediate frequency (IF) 205, second mixer<br>
206, second local oscillator 207, second IF 208 to recover the multicarrier modulated<br>
carrier. A multicarrier demodulator 209 recovers the TDM digital baseband signal. To<br>
demodulate the multicarrier waveform, the received modulated signal is digitally<br>
sampled by a sampler 211, as shown in Fig. 5, at a rate equal to two of four times the<br>
bandwidth of the modulation. These samples are taken during a window of 187.5 µs<br>
duration which is optimally centered on the cluster of time dispersed multipath arrivals<br>
during each symbol period once every 250 µs. The samples are rate down converted by<br><br>
a buffer memory 212 to expand them to the 460 complex time domain samples in the<br>
original 250 µs duration window. These samples are then processed by an 512<br>
coefficient FFT 213 to recover the bits of the TDM bit stream. The receiver 14 next<br>
synchronizes to the TDM masterframe frame preamble via unit 214, demultiplexes and<br>
aligns the prime rate bits via unit 215 and then recovers the bits of a selected broadcast<br>
channel via unit 216. These bits are then forward error corrected using concatenation of<br>
a soft decision Viterbi decoder 217, a de-interleaver 218, followed by a Reed Solomon<br>
decoder 219, to recover the broadcast channel (BC). This recovered BC is supplied as<br>
one input to a decision/combiner unit 240, as described below in connection with Fig.<br>
6.<br>
For a two-arm receiver 14, as depicted Fig. 6, the MCM signal is received as<br>
described with reference to Fig. 4. The QPSK modulated satellite TDM RF waveform<br>
is also received by the antenna 201 operating in conjunction with the low noise RF<br>
front end 202, a mixer 220, a local oscillator 221, a first IF 222, a second mixer 223, a<br>
second local oscillator 224, and a second IF 225, to recover the QPSK-modulated TDM<br>
carrier. As shown in Fig. 7, a QPSK TDM carrier demodulator 226 comprises a QPSK<br>
demodulator 227 which recovers the TDM digital baseband. The receiver 14 next<br>
synchronizes to the TDM masterframe frame preamble 228, demultiplexes and aligns<br>
the prime rate bits 229 and then recovers the bits of a selected broadcast channel. These<br>
bits are then forward error corrected 230 using the concatenation of a soft decision<br>
Viterbi decoder 231, a de-interleaver 232, and a Reed Solomon decoder 232, to recover<br>
the broadcast channel. This recovered BC is supplied as a second input to the<br>
decision/combiner unit 240.<br>
The diversity combiner 240 selects which of the two input BCs is to be<br>
submitted for further processing. It does this based on selecting that BC which is<br>
recovered with the least errors. Estimates of the error counts are available from the soft<br>
decision data supplied by the Viterbi decoders 217 and 231 or the Reed Solomon<br>
decoders 219 and 233. The decision is preferably made with a hysterisis logic which<br>
requires that several errors of difference exist before the decision is reversed. This<br>
process is needed to prevent chattering between the two BCs when the decisions are<br><br>
nearly equally likely. The broadcast channel selected by the diversity combiner 240 is<br>
next supplied to the appropriate source decoder 244 to recover the service(s).<br>
The embodiment of the DBS 10 which uses two GSO satellites 12 and 16 with<br>
terrestrial repeater 18 is shown in Fig. 8. In this configuration, two satellites 12 and 16<br>
are separated by between 30 degrees to 40 degrees longitude along the GSO circle. One<br>
satellite repeats a signal sent from a ground station, and the other satellite repeats the<br>
same signal sent from the same ground station but delays the signal as much as 5 to 10<br>
seconds. The use of two satellites 12 and 16 separated in space results in elevation angle<br>
diversity in the LOS paths between a radio receiver 14 on the earth and each satellite 12<br>
and 16. The time delay between the two satellite signal arrivals results in time diversity.<br>
Each of these types of diversity taken alone can significantly improve the availability of<br>
the LOS signal for a moving mobile receiver 14, and the improvement in availability is<br>
further significantly enhanced by both space and time diversity. Space and time<br>
diversity are particularly important when a mobile receiver 14 is traveling in a suburban<br>
area or in a rural area where the LOS signal blockage is due to bridges, trees and low<br>
buildings. However, for central city and metropolitan areas, where tall buildings<br>
abound, terrestrial re-radiation of the signal is also supplied in accordance with the<br>
present invention to achieve acceptable total area coverage for mobile reception. Thus,<br>
this two-satellite diversity configuration operates essentially the same way as the single<br>
satellite configuration with regard to the diversity between direct LOS satellite<br>
reception and terrestrial re-radiated reception, but adds the time and space diversity<br>
provided by the two satellites. The signal from the early satellite is the one re-radiated<br>
by the terrestrial repeater 18. Choice of the early signal allows any delay encountered in<br>
the signal processing at the repeater 18 or the receiver 14 to be absorbed. The terrestrial<br>
re-radiation network is otherwise implemented in the same way as previously described<br>
for the single satellite configuration.<br>
Another difference between the two-satellite system and the one-satellite system<br>
resides in the three-arm radio receiver 14. The receiver 14 introduces appropriate<br>
/compensating delays via delay units 309 and 310 to achieve simultaneous signal<br>
reception among the three received signals and implement a diversity decision logic<br>
which selects among the three diversity signals. The radio receiver diversity logic design<br><br>
is shown in Fig. 8. It incorporates a maximum likelihood combiner 240 for the Early<br>
and Late LOS satellite signals with a switched combiner 307 between the terrestrial re-<br>
radiated signal and the output of the maximum likelihood combiner 240. When both<br>
signals are degraded, maximum-likelihood combining can improve the quality of<br>
reception. The improvement can be as much as 3 dB in terms of threshold Eb/No when<br>
both signals are equally degraded. The radio receiver 14 is equipped with two receiver<br>
chains 301 and 302 that individually receive and recover the TDM signals from the<br>
Early and Late satellites, respectively, and selects a desired broadcast channel from each.<br>
This is done for each received signal in the same manner as previously described for<br>
LOS satellite reception in Fig. 6. Next, the broadcast channel signal derived from the<br>
early satellite is delayed by a delay unit 309 comprising a memory device to align it<br>
precisely, that is, symbol by symbol, with the symbols of the broadcast channel derived<br>
from the late satellite signal. This can be done by aligning the two broadcast channels<br>
relative to one another so as to cause coincidence of their service control header<br>
preamble correlation spikes. This coincidence is detected in a correlation comparitor<br>
unit in the delay unit 309. The next step is to use the maximum likelihood combiner<br>
240 to combine the bits of the two broadcast channels, bit-by-bit, each bit expressed in<br>
soft decision form. The maximum likelihood combining coefficients are determined<br>
over 1 ms blocks of bits. Next, the output of the maximum likelihood combiner 240 is<br>
applied as one input to the switched combiner 307, with the other input coming from<br>
the terrestrial re-radiated signal receiver arm 308. The choice of which input is to be<br>
passed to the output is based on selecting that BC which is recovered with the least<br>
errors. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, one of the<br>
TDM signal receiver chains (e.g., receiver chain 302 for the late satellite TDM signal)<br>
can be maximum likelihood combined with the signal from the terrestrial re-radiated<br>
signal receiver arm 308, as shown in Fig. 9. Thus, the switched combiner 307 selects<br>
from between the output of the maximum likelihood combiner 240 and the other<br>
satellite signal receiver arm (e.g., arm 301), as shown in Fig. 9. The delay units 309 and<br>
310 can be configured to store the entire recovered bit stream for delay purposes, which<br>
requires more buffering but simplifies combining. Alternatively, the delay units 309<br><br>
and 310 can be configured to store only a portion of the recovered TDM bit stream;<br>
however, synchronization requirements for combining become more complicated.<br>
With regard to switched combiner 307, estimates of the error counts are<br>
available from the soft decision data supplied by the Viterbi decoders 217 and 231 or the<br>
Reed Solomon decoders 219 and 233. The decision is made with a hysterisis logic which<br>
requires that several errors of difference exist before the decision is reversed. This<br>
process is prevents chattering between the two BCs when the decisions are nearly<br>
equally likely. Alternatively, a simple switching logic may be used in which the switch<br>
always favors the choice of the BC having the least errors. Hysterisis is used to prevent<br>
chattering. The latter implementation avoids the more complex maximum likelihood<br>
combining. Yet another alternative could be maximum likelihood combining of the<br>
three input BCs (e.g., from receiver arms 301, 302 and 308), as shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The diversity combiner shown in Fig. 10 combines three signals. Two are<br>
received from two spatially separated satellites 12 and 16, one broadcasting an early<br>
signal and the other broadcasting a late signal. The third signal is received from a<br>
terrestrial repeater 18 which rebroadcasts the early satellite signal. These signals are<br>
received by receiver arm 301 for the early satellite 12, receiver arm 302 for the late<br>
satellite 16 and receiver arm 308 for the early signal retransmitted by the repeater 18.<br>
The diversity combiner 312 combines the symbols in the three signals by maximum<br>
likelihood ratio combining. By this method, the samples of the symbol appearing at the<br>
output have the highest probability of representing the original transmitted symbol. To<br>
do this, the early satellite 12 and repeater 18 signals are delayed relative to the late<br>
satellite signal by delay units 309 and 310 to realign the individual symbols of the three<br>
signals causing them to be in time coincidence. Simple a priori adjustment of the delay<br>
units 309 and 310 suffices to coarsely align the output of the delay units 309 and 310 to<br>
within a TDM frame of 138 µs. Thus, fine alignment of the symbols to the master<br>
frame preamble (MFP) of a TDM frame is nonambiguous. To align the symbols of the<br>
three signals precisely, the MFPs for each signal stream are aligned by fine tuning the<br>
delay units 39 and 310 to within a small fraction of a symbol.<br>
With continued reference to symbol combining in unit 312, the normalized<br>
variance σx2 for the signal symbols, as contained in the background of noise, and<br><br>
uncorrelated multipath interference, is calculated from the observed samples. These<br>
variances are calculated for the early (E), late (L) and repeater 18 or gap-filler (G) signal<br>
symbols. The respective signal samples of the symbols for the early, late and gap-filler<br>
signals are then multiplexed by their variance ratios , which are<br>
defined as follows:<br><br>
The weighting factors are inversely proportional to the estimated variance and are<br>
normalized such that<br><br>
Their sum constitutes the maximum likelihood ratio combined symbols. These are<br>
then passed on to the time demultiplexer/FEC decoder/BC remultiplexer unit 250 (Fig.<br>
11), the components of which have previously been described above in connection with<br>
Fig. 5, to recover the maximum likelihood ratio combined symbols by decision<br>
processing.<br>
The diversity combiner shown in Fig. 12 first combines signals received from<br>
two satellites 12 and 16, one broadcasting an early signal and the other broadcasting a<br>
late signal. The result of this is next combined by minimum bit error decision with<br>
reception of the early signal that has been retransmitted by a gap-filler repeater 18<br>
located on the ground. The individual signals are received by the receiver arm 301 for<br>
the early satellite, the receiver arm 302 for the late satellite and the receiver arm 308 for<br>
the early signal retransmitted by the gap-filler repeater 18. The maximum likelihood<br>
ratio diversity combiner 412 combines the symbols of the early and late satellite signals<br><br>
in the same manner described above in connection with combiner 312 in Fig. 10 for<br>
three signals. By this method, the final symbol appearing at the output of unit 412 has<br>
the highest probability of representing the original transmitted symbol.<br>
The result from unit 412 is next combined with that from the terrestrial repeater<br>
18 by minimum BER select unit 417. Within the unit 417, there are preferably two<br>
units 250 that make FEC-decoded symbol decisions for an entire broadcast channel<br>
frame of the signals applied at their inputs. One unit 250 makes its decisions on the<br>
output from maximum likelihood decision unit 412, and the other unit 250 from the<br>
signal received from the terrestrial repeater 18. These decisions also provide the number<br>
of errors made with each decision observed over the duration of a broadcast frame. A<br>
BER compare unit 414 operates in conjunction with a minimum BER select unit 417 to<br>
select the symbols of that broadcast frame with the least error, as determined from<br>
inputs from Viterbi FEC units 217 and 231. To implement the necessary delay<br>
operations, the early and gap-filler signals are delayed by delay units 309 and 310 to<br>
realign their individual symbols to be in symbol time coincidence with the symbols'<br>
received from the late satellite. The delay alignment method used here is the same as<br>
that described for the implementation of Fig. 10.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an indoor re-<br>
radiation system 450 is provided which is illustrated in Fig. 13. Since LOS reception of<br>
a satellite signal at a radio receiver located inside a building or other structure is<br>
generally not available, unless the radio receiver 14 is located at a window in LOS of the<br>
satellite 12 or 16, indoor reinforcement of satellite signals for more complete coverage.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, an antenna 452 can be located externally with respect to a<br>
building so as to achieve LOS reception of satellite signals. A tuned RF front-end unit<br>
454 is connected to the antenna 452 and is preferably configured to select the portion of<br>
the RF spectrum that contains the essential frequency content of the satellite signal and<br>
by doing so with very low added noise. An interconnecting cable 456 is provided to<br>
supply the signal at the output of the tuned RF front-end unit 454 to an amplifier 458.<br>
The amplifier 458 is connected to a re-radiating antenna 460 located within the building.<br>
The amplifier 458 is configured to increase the power of the satellite signal to a<br>
level that, when re-radiated, by the antenna 460, is sufficient to permit satisfactory<br><br>
indoor reception for a radio receiver. The power level radiated from the antenna 460 is<br>
sufficiently high to achieve satisfactory indoor reception at locations which are not in<br>
the LOS of the satellite, but not so high as to cause instability by signals returned by the<br>
path between the indoor antenna 460 and one or more of the receiving antennas 452.<br>
Thus, high isolation (i.e., on the order of 70-80 dB) is preferred between the indoor<br>
antenna 466 and the outdoor antenna 452.<br>
Reception areas will be present (e.g., through windows or other openings to the<br>
building or structure) where indoor re-radiated signals combine with an outdoor signal<br>
transmitted directly from the satellite. To assure that the combination of these signals<br>
does not occur in an manner which is destructive to signal content, the time delay<br>
between an outdoor signal and an indoor signal in the region of combination is<br>
preferably less than a fraction of the symbol width of the signal being transmitted. For<br>
example, for a symbol width of approximately 540 nanoseconds, a time delay between<br>
50 and 100 nanoseconds can be tolerated. The time delay is generally due to the time<br>
required for a signal to travel the path comprising the outdoor antenna 452, the cable<br>
(where signals generally travel at two-thirds the speed of light), and onward to the<br>
indoor antenna 460. Another delay occurs as the signal travels from the indoor antenna<br>
460 to the radio receiver 14 in an area covered by the indoor antenna. This time delay<br>
is preferably only 20% of the symbol width, that is, not more than 100 nanoseconds for<br>
a system in which the symbol width is 540 nanoseconds.<br>
The purpose of a terrestrial repeater is to repeat a signal received from the<br>
satellite into areas where the signal is otherwise blocked. A multiplicity of these<br>
terrestrial repeaters 18 may be placed along a roadway or other path at a height h and<br>
separated by distances d, as shown in Fig. 14. The heights and separation distances<br>
between the terrestrial repeaters need not be equal. A terrestrial repeater 18 comprises a<br>
receive antenna 462 that is pointed at the satellite 12 or 16, a receiver (not shown) that<br>
recovers the signal and amplifies it with a gain that is sufficient to drive a transmit<br>
antenna 464 such as to a power flux density in the path below which is comparative to<br>
that normally expected from the satellite. The transmit antenna 464 is shielded so as to<br>
prevent the transmitted signal from reaching the terrestrial repeater receive antenna 462<br>
at a level sufficient to create instability. The transmit antenna 464 radiates its power<br><br>
over an aperture of length L sufficient to cause path length diversity over several<br>
wavelengths between the transmitter 464 and the vehicle's receive antenna at the carrier<br>
frequency.<br>
As a vehicle drives along the path, the radio receiver 14 therein receives signals<br>
coming from more than one terrestrial repeater 18. For example, in position A, a<br>
vehicle is nearest to terrestrial repeater 18b and that terrestrial repeater's signal<br>
dominates and be responsible for reception. Signals from terrestrial repeaters 18a and<br>
18b are low because of distance and antenna pattern and cause little interference. If the<br>
vehicle is at position B, the radio receiver 14 therein receives signals from both<br>
terrestrial repeaters 18c and 18d. Since the distances are nearly equal, and assuming that<br>
the time difference between signals radiated from terrestrial repeaters 3 and 4 is adjusted<br>
to zero, the time difference of arrival between the signals received at the vehicle are<br>
sufficiently small so as to cause constructive reinforcement. By proper choice of the<br>
distances h and d in relationship with the symbol period of the digital signal being<br>
received, this condition can be achieved.<br>
It is important to cause diversity in the signals that arrive at the vehicle from the<br>
different terrestrial repeaters. If this is not done, then the signals from two terrestrial<br>
repeaters, as would be received in the location B, would combine alternately in-phase<br>
and out-of-phase and phases in between. When they are in phase, the signals reinforce,<br>
and when out-of-phase the signals cancel. When signal cancellation occurs, the signal is<br>
completely lost. In addition, the resulting carrier phase of the signal created by addition<br>
of the terrestrial repeater carriers rotates at a rate equal to a nearly monochromatic<br>
Doppler difference, making it difficult to recover the QPSK modulation. The spread in<br>
arrival times caused by the diversity transmission resulting from distribution of the<br>
transmitted signal over the aperture L, or over an equivalent time difference of L/C<br>
where C = speed of light, eliminates the amplitude cancellation and provides the<br>
possibility of correcting the impact of the phase rotation by application of adaptive<br>
equalization techniques. This applied to all vehicle locations between locations A and<br>
B.<br>
An example of the proper choice of distances in relationship to symbol period is<br>
seen by considering a signal having a symbol period on the order of 540 to 550<br><br>
nanoseconds. The spacing d and height h is selected so as to cause the time delay in<br>
transversing the slant distance (d2 + h2)½ to cause a delay of no greater than a quarter<br>
of a symbol period. In this example, the slant distance is 550/d = 137.5 ft. One<br>
nanosecond is equivalent to one foot at the speed of light. Thus, if the height is 20 feet,<br>
the distance d is 180 feet. The height h is preferably relatively small when compared to<br>
distance d so as to cause the difference in distance between the vehicle and each<br>
terrestrial repeater 18 to change by an amount sufficient to assure that the signal level<br>
from any one terrestrial repeater is attenuated by 10 dB or more compared to that from<br>
a terrestrial repeater immediately overhead. The length L is preferably between 5 to 10<br>
feet to provide sufficient path length diversity at L-band frequencies. If an equalizer<br>
unit is incorporated in the vehicle's mobile receiver 14, the time difference in arrival can<br>
be extended to several symbols, thus increasing the distance between the terrestrial<br>
repeaters to over 1000 feet. An equivalent time difference would be to transmit the<br>
signal several times from the same source over a spread not exceeding 5-10 nanoseconds.<br>
While various embodiments have been chosen to illustrate the invention, it will<br>
be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be<br>
made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the<br>
