COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br><br>
"A BURGLAR-ALARM APPARATUS FOR A MOTORCYCLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, 1-1 Minamiaoyarna 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
ORGN<br>
81/mum/2001<br><br>
17 -3 -2006<br><br>
[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[Technical Field to which the Invention Belongs]<br>
The present invention relates to a burglar-alarm apparatus for a motorcycle having a releasable shutter provided on a motorcycle.<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 9-151642. there is disclosed a burglar-alarm apparatus for a motorcycle in which the key insertion port of a main switch is releasably covered with a shutter, and an actuator actuates synchronously with opening or closing of the shutter. Moreover, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. Hei 7-69257, there is disclosed a burglar-alarm apparatus for a motorcycle wherein a main stand storage lock is unlocked via a cable by means of an operation knob disposed within a luggage box below a seat.<br>
[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
The shutter of the main switch requires a dedicated actuator such as a solenoid. However, such an actuator makes the structure complicated, leading to an increase in the cost of the whole apparatus. Therefore, it is desired to omit such an actuator and to omit an unlocking mechanism dedicated to the shutter. It is an object of the present invention to realize such a demand.<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to solve the above problems, a first invention related to a burglar-alarm apparatus for a motorcycle in this application is a burglar-alarm apparatus for a<br><br>
motorcycle  comprising   a  shutter which  releasably  covers   a  key  insertion port, characterized in that opening and closing of this shutter is linked with an unlocking operation section of a main stand storage lock disposed below a seat. [0005]~<br>
A second invention is characterized in that, in the first invention, unlocking of a handle lock is linked with the unlocking operation section of the main stand storage lock. .[0006] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the first invention, since the unlocking operation section of the main stand storage lock is linked with opening and closing of the shutter of the main switch, there is no need to provide an actuator dedicated to the unlocking mechanism of the shutter, enabling a simple structure and a reduction in costs of the whole apparatus. In addition, since opening and closing of the shutter is linked with the main stand storage lock, the operation procedure is not increased, to thereby improve the operability and increase the anti-theft effect.<br>
According to the second invention,, since the unlocking mechanism of the handle lock is linked with the unlocking operation section of the main stand storage lock, functions can be gathered intensively to the unlocking operation section of the main stand storage Jock. AJso by providing the handle lock separately from the main stand, it becomes possible to provide a stronger handle lock.<br><br><br>
[Embodiments of the Invention]<br>
One embodiment will now be described based on the drawings. FIG 1 is a conceptual diagram of an entire burglar-alarm apparatus for a motorcycle, FIG 2 is an overall diagram of a motorcycle to which the embodiment is applied, FIG 3 is a diagram showing an apparent side face of a main stand, FIG 4 is a diagram showing the upper face side of the main stand (in the direction of an arrow A in FIG 3), FIG 5 is a diagram showing the operation of the main stand, FIG 6 is a side view of the main part of the rear part of a vehicle frame, FIG 7 is a diagram showing an unlocking operation section seen from the upper side, FIG 8 is a diagram showing a main stand storage lock from the side and FIG 9 is a diagram showing the main stand storage lock from the upper side (in the direction of an arrow B in FIG. 8).<br>
At first, referring to FIG 2, this motorcycle is a scooter type, provided with a<br><br>
main switch 3 on a handle stem cover 2 covering a handle stem 1, and a shutter releasing mechanism 4 is provided in this main switch 3. The main switch 3 is a known composite switch comprising an ignition switch, a lighting switch and the like.<br>
A luggage box 6 opened upwards is provided below the seat 5, which is opened or closed by the seat 5, and the seat 5 is locked by a seat lock 7 onto the vehicle frame side, and unlocked by the same key as the main stand 3. Moreover, as described below, an operation knob 8 (FIG. 1) is disposed as an unlocking operation section within the luggage box 6, to which one end of a cable 9 is connected, with "the other end being connected to a main stand storage lock 11 provided via a joint section 10 on the lower part of the vehicle frame, thereby enabling unlocking. (0011]<br>
The main stand storage lock 11 is for preventing burglary by hindering storage of the main stand 12, and when the main stand storage lock 11 is unlocked, the main stand 12 can be stored, thereby enabling riding. Moreover, the main stand storage lock 11 is connected via a branch cable 13 branched from the joint section 10 to the shutter releasing mechanism 4, to actuate the shutter releasing mechanism 4 synchronously with unlocking of the main stand storage lock 11, to thereby open the shutter, enabling insertion of a key into the main stand for turning the switch ON. The joint section 10 is constructed such that when the cable 9 is pulled so as to unlock the main stand storage lock 11, the branch cable 13 is conversely loosened. [0012]<br>
As shown in FIG 3 to FIG 5, one end of the shutter 15 which releasably covers above the key insertion port 14 disposed on the upper end face of the main stand 2 is rotatably fitted to the main stand 2 by a spindle 16, with the other end being connected with one end of the branch cable 13.<br>
The branch cable 13 is guided to the rear end of a stay 17 extending integrally from the main stand 2 side, to thereby rotate and energize the shutter 35 in the clockwise direction in the figure by means of a compression coil spring 18 interposed between the stay 17 and the shutter 15. The branch cable 13 is for compressing the compression coil spring 18, except at the time of the unlocking operation section, to pull the shutter 15 in the counterclockwise direction up to a position covering above the key insertion port 14.<br>
Moreover, when the operation knob 8 is operated in the unlocking direction,<br><br><br>
the branch cable 13 is loosened at the joint section 10, as shown in FIG 5, to allow the rotation of the shutter in the clockwise direction by means of the compression coil spring 18, so as to open the key insertion port 14. <br>
Next, the operation lever and the main stand lock will be described with reference to FIG 6 to FIG 9. As shown in FIG 6, the seat 5 is locked onto the vehicle frame side by the seat lock 7 supported at the rear part of the vehicle frame 20, and unlocked by the same key as the main switch 3. Moreover, as described below in detail, the operation knob 8 is provided as an unlocking operation member within the luggage box 6, to which one end of the operation cable 9 is connected, with the other end being connected to a main stand Jock (described later), thereby enabling unlocking. <br>
The main stand lock is an apparatus for preventing burglary during parking, which makes it impossible to drive with the main stand 16 being kept standing, unless the seat lock 57 is unlocked and the operation lever 58 is properly operated. On the other hand, if the operation lever 58 is properly operated to unlock the main stand lock, the main stand 16 is knocked down and stored, thereby enabling driving. [0017]<br>
Furthermore, the operation cable 59 is laid out along the inner side of the vehicle frame at the rear, and the operation cable 13 of the handle lock is branched at the joint section 10 disposed in the middle of the layout. The operation cable 45 branched from the joint section 60 is laid out up to the handle lock on the inner side of the vehicle frame cover along the front part of the vehicle frame, and when the operation lever 58 is turned in the unlocking direction, it is pulled together with the operation cable 59 to thereby effect an unlocking operation.<br>
A stand bracket 23 is welded to a cross pipe 22 which connects the rear end portions of left and right lower parts 9, and this stand bracket 62 forms a wall portion 23a to give a container shape opened upwards. To the rear end thereof, the upper end of the main stand 16 is rotatably attached via the spindle 31, so as to lock the upper end by the main stand lock. The main stand 16 is energized by a reversing spring (not shown) to thereby selectively turn to either position of the standing position or the storing position.<br>
FIG 7 is a diagram showing the rear part of the inside of the glove box 14 from the front (from the direction of an arrow B in FIG. 6), and as shown in this figure, the<br><br>
operation lever 58 is rotatably supported by the spindle 65 towards inside of the rear wall 25 constituting a part of the glove box 14. One end of the spindle 24 protrudes rearwards, penetrating through the rear wall 66, with an arm 27 being disposed integrally therewith, and one end of the operation cable 59 is connected to the tip thereof. The rotation of this operation lever 58 is regulated by a stopper slope 28 formed on the left and right sides of the upper end portion of a stopper plate 28 fitted to the rear wall 66.<br><br>
The position of the arm 67 is such that at the lock position shown by a solid<br>
line where the operation lever 58 is made to turn in the clockwise direction in the figure<br>
to abut against the stopper slope 68b, the operation cable 59 is pulled, and at the unlock<br>
position shown by a virtual line where the operation lever 58 is made to turn on the<br>
opposite side to abut against the stopper slope 68a, and the operation cable 59 is<br>
loosened.<br><br>
The operation lever 58 is fixed at the lock position or the unlock position, by reversing the turn direction of the arm 67. That is to say, the operation cable 59 in the lock position or the unlock position is set so as to pass on the opposite sides, putting the center of the spindle 65 therebetween. As a result, when the operation lever 58 is turned between the lock position shown by the solid line and the unlock position show by the virtual line, the turning direction of the arm 67 is reversed, designating the center of the spindle 65 as a dead center, and positioned at this reversing turn position, by the operation cable 13 and the resilience of a return spring 30 described later. <br>
Reference symbol 25a in the figure is an access slit of a locking metal fitting 26 disposed on the bottom of the seat, and 7a is a hook of a seat lock 57 to be engaged therewith. The seat lock 57 is fitted to a cross pipe 20a disposed between the upper parts of the rear part 10 on the left and right sides that constitutes the vehicle frame 6.<br>
The main stand lock will now be described in detail. As shown in FIG 8 and FIG 9, the stand bracket 62 forms a substantially sealed space, into which it is hard to put the hand from outside, with the periphery thereof being surrounded by a wall portion.    Within this space, the main stand lock 11 is stored.<br>
The main stand lock 70 comprises a lock plate 33 rotatably supported by a spindle 32 therearound with respect to a support plate 31 fixed within the stand bracket<br><br>
62, and one end of the operation cable 9 and one end of the return spring 30 are connected to one end 34 of the lock plate 33.    The other end of the return spring 30 is latched together with the support plate 71. [0023]<br>
The end portion on the opposite side of the one end 74, putting the spindle 72 of the lock plate 73 therebetween, forms an engagement end portion 36,"and is fitted to a slit 39 on the bracket side formed in the laminated portion of a reinforcing plate 37 and a rear vertical wail 38, so as to be freely accessible into a slit 41 on the stand side formed on an upper wall 40 of the main stand 16 which is in an upright position. |0026] <br>
A slit 8J on the stand side coincides with a slit 79 on the bracket side, only when the main stand 16 is in an upright position, so that an engagement end portion 76 of the lock plate 73 can be fitted in. When the engagement end portion 76 engages with the slit 81 on the stand side, the main stand 16 is locked and becomes unrotatable, and hence is kept in the upright position. <br>
The return spring 75 always rotates and energizes the lock plate 73 in the clockwise direction in FIG 11, to eject the engagement end portion 76 from the slit 81 on the stand side, to thereby effect the unlock position shown by a virtual line in the drawings. On the other hand, the operation cable 59 rotates the lock plate 73 in the counterclockwise direction against the resilience of the return spring 75, so as to fit the engagement end portion 76 into the slit 81 on the stand side, to thereby effect the lock position shown by a solid line in the figure. <br>
Reference symbol 42 in the figure is a rotation stopper, and abuts against a reinforcing plate 77 in the lock position, and abuts against a corner 43 of the support plate 71 in the unlock position, to thereby regulate rotation of the lock plate 73.<br><br>
The operation of this embodiment will now be described. As shown in FIG 1, when the operation knob 8 in the luggage box 6 is turned in the direction of unlocking the main stand storage lock 11, the shutter 15 is opened simultaneously upon unlocking of the main stand storage lock 11, to open the key insertion port 14 of the main stand 2. Then, insertion of the key turns the ignition switch ON, thereby enabling driving. <br>
As described above, since unlocking of the main stand storage lock 11 and opening of the shutter 15 can be effected only by operating the operation knob 8,<br><br>
operation becomes simple, to improve the operability. In addition, there is no need to provide an actuator such as a solenoid for opening the shutter 15 on the main stand 2 side, thereby enabling a simple structure and a reduction in costs. Moreover, since opening of the shutter 15 is linked with the main stand storage lock 11 that is also for preventing burglary, the anti-theft effect can be increased.<br>
As shown in FIG 1. the handle lock plate 51 can be also linked with the main stand storage lock 11 via the branch cable 50 from the joint section 10. By doing so. the handle lock plate 51 can be directly engaged with the slit 52 formed on the stem pipe 1, thereby enabling construction of a stronger handle lock.<br>
Moreover, since the stroke of the handle lock plate 51 can be made large, the freedom in setting the lever ratio increases. Furthermore, since a member for preventing burglary is linked therewith, such effects as improvement in the operability and prevention of burglary can be obtained.<br>
The present invention is not limited" to the above embodiment, and various modifications and applications are possible. For example, the handle lock may be integrated with the main stand 2. Moreover, other various known structures can be adopted as the releasing mechanism of the shutter and the main stand storage lock.<br><br><br>
