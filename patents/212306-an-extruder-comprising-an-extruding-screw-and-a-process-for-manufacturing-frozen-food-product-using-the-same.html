SECTION    10<br>
TITLE<br>
AN EXTRUDER COMPRISING AN EXTRUDING SCREW AND A PROCESS FOR  MANUFACTURING " FROZEN FOOD PRODUCT USING THE SAME<br>
APPLICANT<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever H6use, 165/166 Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai 400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 00/72697	                                                              PCT/EP00/04724<br><br>
Technical field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process and an apparatus for the production of a frozen food product and more particulanly anrice cream.<br>
Background of the invention	..,,<br>
"	\	.<br>
Screw extruders such as single and twin screw extruders have been widely used and for a long time in the food industry, for example in the production of cereal based products. More recently, it has also been proposed to use single or twin screw extruders in the freezing of ice cream.<br><br>
aerated frozen products wherein a twin screw extruder is used. The characteristic of the screws in the extruder is  that they have a length over diameter ratio of between 30 and 60. It is not disclosed whether the diameter -which is referred to is the diameter of the core of the screw or. the diameter of the core of the. screw plus its pitch.. ,• EP808577 discloses a similar process and apparatus but whilst uses a single screw extruder having the same geometry.<br>
EP561118 discloses a process and an apparatus for manufacturing frozen edible foams such as ice cream wherein a twin screw extruder is used. The geometry of the screw is defined by a (channel depth/channel width) ratio of approximately 0.1 and a pitch angle of between 22 and 30 degrees.<br>
2<br><br>
WO97/26800. discloses- a.process and an apparatus.for manufacturing frozen edible foams such as ice cream wherein a single screw extruder is used. The geometry of the screw is defined by a (length of the screw/ inner diameter of the 5 extruder barrel) ratio of between 5 and 10 a (pitch/external screw diameter) ratio of 1 to 2 and a (external diameter of the screw/inner diameter of the screw) of 1.1 to 1.4. According to the drawings, the screw has a single thread start;. <br>
1.0<br>
One of the. big problems.faced. when using an extruder.for ,the manufacture. of ice., cream is.that .a  temperature as low as  possible is required while keeping an acceptable flow.  Now, the lower the temperature the bigger the flow resistance<br>
15 which by generating frictions re-heats the product which is being cooled and limits the temperature which is thus achieved. There is therefore a need for optimising the geometry of the extruder in such a way that the increase in friction which is generated when the product is cooled is<br>
20 minimised in order to reach a temperature as low as possible.<br>
It has now been found that-" it is possible to dramatically increase. the performance ,of an extruder, when used in the 25 - manufacturing of, ice cream by;<br>
. operating with a pitch angle which is outside what has been used up to now in the manufacturing of ice cream, operating with screws which have more than one thread 30 start whereas up to now screws with only one thread start screws have been disclosed, . operating with extruders which are much shorter than what has been used up to now.<br>

Tests and Definitions<br>
1. Screw parameters<br>
An extruder screw is defined by different parameters which need accurate definitions. In order to help in the definition of such parameters, reference is made to Fig.l which discloses a typical screw fitted in a single screw extruder. Such an extruder is for example described in Engineering principles of plasticating extrusion - Zehev Tadmor - Krieger Publishing Company - 1978 — pages 39 to 46.<br>
Screw length : LT (length of the screw which is in contact with the barrel)<br>
Pitch length: Sp (axial distance of a full turn (screw lead))<br>
Thread starts: A screw can have more than one helix, in the rest of the description, each helix is called a thread start and the number of thread starts is "n" - On Fig.l, the screw which is represented has two thread starts.<br>
Channel depth: H (the distance between the root of the screw and the  inner  surface  of  the barrel  less  the  radial clearance between • the  crest   of    the screw and  the -inner surface of the barrel)<br>
Screw diameter De: Diameter of the barrel less the distance between the root of the screw and the inner surface of the barrel.<br>
Pitch angle: Arctg(Sp/pi.De)<br>

PGT/EP00/04724<br><br><br><br><br><br>
/<br>
           Channel width: wc. (distance between. the flights along a<br>
helical line which is perpendicular to the flight).<br><br><br>
Summary of the invention<br><br>
.It is a first object of the present invention to provide an extruder comprising an extruding screw characterised by between 2 and 6 thread starts, preferably 2 and 5 thread<br>
starts/ and a pitch angle of between 28 and 45 degrees<br>
       10     preferably between 32 and 42 degrees,<br><br><br><br><br>
Preferably;: the rxtruder comprises cooling means more. preferably, the cooling means are constituted by a cooling circuit wherein a cooling liquid is circulated. Even more 15  preferably the cooling liquid is ammonia or nitrogen.<br><br><br><br>
20<br><br>
It has been found that the higher the number of thread starts, the higher the ammonia temperature required to achieve a given temperature at the output of the extruder, showing that increasing the number of thread starts leads to a better cooling effect<br><br>
Preferably the (H/wc ) ratio is between is  less than 0.2 more preferably more, than. 0.1.. It. has been found that: at low<br>
25 H/wc ratio," the heat exchange (cooling) improves but the thermal dissipation (heating) due to friction increases. Conversely at higher H/wc ratio, the heat exchange decreases but the thermal dissipation decreases even more, therefore, operating  at  high  H/wc  ratio  is  preferred.  There  is<br>
30 nevertheless a limit in the H/wc ratio which can be used since, above a certain limit, the product is no longer thermally homogeneous and cold and warm zones start appearing which do not mix any more.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 00/72697<br><br>
PCT/EP00/04724<br><br>
Preferably also, the screw comprises between 3 and 4 thread starts and the cooling liquid is ammonia-.<br>
Preferably also the screw has a LT/De ratio of between 2 and 10, more preferably between 2 and 5, even more preferably between 2 and 4. It has been found that, and contrary to what is suggested by the prior art, not only there is no need for going for long screws but it is effectively a waste of energy. If the screw is too long, the heat dissipation due to the friction caused by the increase in viscosity generated by the cooling tends to equate the cooling effect and the two phenomenon (cooling and heat dissipation) equilibrate and there is no cooling taking place at the end" of the screw. Nevertheless, the friction existing at the end of the screw, where no cooling takes place, requires additional torque to keep the screw rotating for no benefit to the process or the end product.<br>
Preferably also, the extruder is a single screw extruder.<br>
It is a second object of the invention to provide extruder comprising an extruding screw characterised by a pitch angle of between 28 and 45. degree, preferably between 32 and 4-2, and a LT/De ratio of between 2- and 10,- preferably 2 - and 5, more  preferably :2 and 4. <br>
It is a third object of the present invention to provide a process for the manufacturing of frozen food product, wherein a food composition is mixed, aerated and cooled down to a temperature of between -4°C and -7°C and then processed in an extruder for further cooling down to a temperature of between -12° and -20°, characterised in that the extruder comprises an extruding screw having 2 to 5 thread starts and a pitch angle of between 28 and 45 degrees, preferably between 32 and 42 degrees,  and further comprises cooling<br>
