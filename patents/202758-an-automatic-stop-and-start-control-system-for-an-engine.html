COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]	t<br>
l\\A "AUTOMATIC STOP AND START CONTROL SYSTEM FOR* ENGINE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an automaHr stop and start control system for an engine.<br>
This invention relates to an automatic stop and start control system of an engine for interrupting ignition control of an engine in response to a predetermined vehicle stopping condition in running the -engine, for restarting the ignition<br><br>
control of the engine in response to a predetermined starting Ibperation after the engine have been interrupted, and particularly, for restricting automatic stoppage of the engine in response to temperature of the engine.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
There.is known a stop and start control system of an engine in which when a vehicle is stopped, an engine is automatically stopped, and the vehicle is automatically started by automatically restarting the engine upon carrying out a starting operation such that a throttle grip is operated from a stationary state of the engine, in order to restrain exhaust gas or fuel consumption during an idling operation (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication H4-246252).<br>
[0003]<br>
[Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
Cooling water will never be boiled even in a case where engine temperature has reached such a high temperature state as in after continuous running under high load of an engine, since the cooling water is circulated inside an engine while being cooled by a radiator as long as a water pump is operated.<br>
[0004]<br>
Here, in the above-described water pump, there is a mechanical type to be operated by means of rotation of an engine or a motor driven type to be operated by means of an electric motor. The former is simple in a structure, inexpensive and light in weight comparing with the latter, however, the water pump itself is brought into a stopped state, when the engine<br><br>
comes  to be  stopped.<br>
[0005]<br>
Accordingly, when the stop and start control system of the engine is adopted, further, the water pump to be operated by means of rotation of an engine is adopted, if vehicle stoppage condition has been established while an engine is in a high temperature,state, there has happened such a drawback as that temperature pf an engine is hard to be lowered, since the water pump is simultaneously brought into the stopped state in accordance with automatic stoppage of an engine.<br>
[0006]<br>
In the conventional art, since a start control with engine temperature as a parameter has not been conducted, there has been such a technical drawback as that knocking is liable to be generated in an engine in a case where an engine which has been stationary in a high temperature state, is restarted.<br>
[0007]<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an automatic stop and start control system of an engine resolving the conventional problems and controlling automatic stop and start of an engine while taking account of temperature of the engine.<br>
[0008]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, the present invention is characterized in that in an automatic stop and start control system of an engine including an ignition control means which interrupts an ignition control of an engine<br><br>
in response to a predetermined vehicle stoppage condition in Running the engine and restarts the ignition control of the engine in response to a .predetermined starting operation by a driver after having been interrupted, the ignition control means, at least, includes means described hereinafter. [0009]<br>
(1)	Means included are an engine temperature detecting<br>
means for detecting temperature of the engine and a prohibiting<br>
means for prohibiting interruption of the ignition control of<br>
the engine when the detected .temperature is equal to or more<br>
than a predetermined reference temperature.<br>
[0010]<br>
(2)	Further means included are an engine temperature<br>
detecting means for detecting temperature of an engine and an<br>
ignition timing control means for retarding the ignition timing<br>
more than a reference ignition timing when restarting the<br>
ignition control of the engine in a case where the detected<br>
temperature of the engine is equal to or more than a<br>
predetermined reference temperature.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the characteristic (1), the engine can be cooled even if the predetermined vehicle stoppage condition is established when temperature of the engine is equal to or more than a predetermined reference temperature, since the engine continues rotating without being interrupted the ignition control of the engine. [0012] According to the characteristic (2), knocking is<br><br>
prevented from occurring since ignition timing is retarded in restarting the ignition control of the engine when temperature of the engine is equal to or more than the predetermined reference temperature.<br>
The present invention relates to an automatic stop and start control system for an engine, comprising an ignition control means for interrupting an ignition control of the engine in response to a predetermined vehicle stoppage condition in running the engine and for restarting the ignition control of the engine in response to a predetermined starting operation by a driver after having been interrupted,<br>
wherein said control means includes, at least,<br>
a temperature detecting means for detecting temperature of the engine and,<br>
a prohibiting means for prohibiting the interruption of the ignition control of said engine when said detected engine temperature is equal to or more than a predetermined reference temperature and;<br>
an ignition timing control means for controlling ignition timing of the engine in response to said detected temperature of the engine, and<br>
wherein said ignition timing control means retards the ignition timing more than a reference ignition timing when the engine temperature in restarting ignition of the engine in response to said starting operation is equal to or more than a predetermined reference temperature.<br><br>

[0022]<br>
The engine 200 will be described in detail. Fig. 4 shows a cross sectional view of a starting/generating device connected to a crankshaft of the engine, and a cross sectional view taken on line A - A at a position illustrated in Fig. 1.<br><br>
[0023]<br>
In Fig. 4, a crankshaft 12 freely rotatably supported by main bearings 10 and 11 is provided in a swing unit case 31 provided with a hanger 37 held by the main pipe 7 and a connecting rod 14 is connected to the crankshaft 12 via a crank pin 13. An inner rotor 15 of the starting/generating device is provided at one end section of the crankshaft 12 overhung from a crankcase<br>
[0024]<br>
The inner rotor 15 has a rotor boss 16 and permanent magnets 19 fitted on an outer peripheral surface of the rotor boss 16. The permanent magnets 19 are, for example, of neodymium iron boron base and are provided at six places spaced apart at equal angles from one another around the crankshaft 12. The rotor boss 16 is fitted at the center section thereof on the tip taper section of the crankshaft 12. A flange member 39 is arranged at one end of the rotor boss 16 (at the end on the opposite side of the crankshaft 12) and the rotor boss 16 is fixed to the crankshaft 12 together with the flange member by means of bolts 20.<br>
[0025]<br>
A small diameter cylinder section 40 protruded on a side of the flange member 39 is formed on the rotor boss 16 and a brush holder 41 freely slidable relative to this cylindrical section 40 is provided on an outer periphery of the cylinder section 40. The brush holder 41 is energized in the flange member 39 direction by means of a compression coil spring 42. A brush 44 energized by the compression coil spring 43 is<br><br>
provided on the brush holder 41. A connection pin 45 extended  parallel with a center shaft of the crankshaft 12 is penetrated through the ;rotor boss 16, one end thereof is connected to the brush holder 41, and the other end thereof is connected to a plate 46 of a governor (regarding a detail will be described later).<br>
[0026].<br>
A stator core 48 of an outer stator 47 arranged on an outer periphery of the inner rotor 15 is fixed to a swing unit case 31 by means of bolts 49. A magneto coil 50 and a starting coil 51 are wound around a yoke 48 of the stator core 48 and a cylindrical section 48b extended from the stator core 48 covers the brush holder 41. A commutator holder 52 is connected to an end section of the cylindrical section 48b, commutator pieces are fixed to the commutator holder 52 so as to slidingly move each other with the brush 44. That is, the commutator pieces 53 are arranged in a position opposing to the brush 44 energized by the compression coil spring 43.<br>
[0027]<br>
In the mean time, in Fig. 4, only one peace of the brush 44 is illustrated, however, it is of course natural that the required number of pieces of brushes 44 are provided in a rotational direction of the inner rotor 15. An example of the number of pieces and shapes of the brush and the commutator pieces are described in a specification of the prior application (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication H9-215292) according to an applicant of the present invention. Further, when the brush holder 41 is biased to the crankshaft 12 side by means<br><br>
-fa governor described later, a stroke of the brush 44 is restricted to a predetermined amount so as to separate the brushes 44 from the commutator pieces 53. For the purpose of stroke restriction, a locking means, which is not illustrated, is provided between the brush holder 41 and the brushes 44.<br>
[0028]<br>
A governor 54 for switching a starting mode and a power generating mo&amp;e automatically is provided at an end section of the rotor boss 16^, that is, on the fitting side of the rotor boss 16 on the crankshaft 12. The governor 54 includes the plate 46 and a roller 55 as a governor weight for biasing the plate 46 in a central axial direction of the crankshaft 12. As the roller 55, one provided with a resin cover on the metal made core is preferred, however, the roller, which is not provided with the resin cover or an entire body of the roller may well be formed out of resin. A pocket 56 for storing the roller 55 is formed on the rotor boss 16 and the pocket 56 is constituted in a taper shape cross section becoming narrower on a side of the outer stator 47 as illustrated in Fig. 4.<br>
[0029]<br>
A radiator fan 57 is mounted on the flange member 39 and a radiator 58 is provided opposing to the radiator fan 57. Further, a sprocket 59 is fixed on the crankshaft 12 and between the inner rotor 15 and the main baring 11. A chain 60 to get a power for driving a camshaft (refer to Fig. 5) from the crankshaft 12 is wound on the sprocket 59. Further, the sprocket 59 is integrally formed with a gear 61 for transmitting the power to a pump for circulating lubricating oil. The gear 61 transmits<br><br>
the power to a gear fixed to a drive shaft of a trochoid pump, Which will be described later. [0030]<br>
In a constitution described above, when voltage is applied to the commutator pieces 53 from a battery (not illustrated) by pushing a starter switch, a current is carried to the stator coil 51 and. the inner rotor. 15 is rotated. As a result, the crankshaft 1^2 coupled with the inner rotor 15 rotates, and the engine 200 is start moving. When the speed of the engine 200 increases, the governor weight 55 receives centrifugal force, and the governor weight 55 moves in an out peripheral direction of the rotor boss 16 in an inside of the pocket 56 and arrives at a position illustrated in two-dots chain line in Fig. 4. [0031]<br>
When the governor weight moves, the plate 46 and a connection pin 45 engaged with the plate 46 are biased as illustrated in two dots chain line. Since the other end of the connection pin 45 is engaged with the brush holder 41, the brush holder 41 is also similarly biased. Since strokes of the brushes 44 are restricted as described above, when the brush holder 41 is biased larger than this stroke, contact of the brushes 44 with the commutator pieces 53 are broken. After the brushes 44 are separated from the commutator pieces 53, the crankshaft 12 rotates by engine drive, as a result, power is generated by a power generating coil 51, and a current is supplied to the battery.<br>
[0032]<br>
A structure in the vicinity of a head of the engine 200<br><br>
will be described. Fig. 5 shows a sectional side elevation view illustrating a structure in the vicinity of a head of the engine. A piston 63 arranged inside a cylinder 62 is connected to a small end side of a connecting rod 14 via a piston pin 64. An ignition plug 65 is attached by screw to a cylinder head 32, and an electrode section of the plug 65 is faced to a combustion chamber formed between a head of the piston 63 and the cylinder head 32. An area "Ground the cylinder 62 is surrounded by a water jackets 66.<br>
[0033]<br>
A camshaft 69 freely rotatably supported by the bearings 67 and 68 is provided upward the cylinder 62 inside the cylinder head 32. An attachment 70 is fitted on the camshaft 69 and a cam sprocket 72 is fixed to the attachment 70 by means of bolts 71. The chain 60 is wound on the cam sprocket 72. By means of this chain 60 rotation of the sprocket 59 (refer to Fig. 4), in the other word, rotation of the crankshaft 12 is transmitted to the camshaft 69.<br>
[0034]<br>
A rocker arm 73 is provided on an upper section of the camshaft 69, this rocker arm 73 rocks in response to a cam shape of the camshaft 69 in association with rotation of the camshaft 69. The cam shape of the camshaft 69 is determined so as to open/close an intake valve 95 and exhaust valve 96 in response to a predetermined stroke of the four cycle engine. An intake tube 23 is opened/closed by means of the intake valve 95, and an exhaust tube 97 is opened/closed by means of the exhaust valve 96.<br><br>
[0035]<br>
An exhaust cam and an intake cam are integrally formed with each other on the chmshaft 69, adjoining with these cams, a decompression cam 98 engaging with the camshaft 69 only in a reverse rotation direction is provided. The decompression cam 98 turns at a position more protruded than an outer peripheral shape of the fexhaust cam by following up rotation of the camshaft 69 at the time, of reverse rotation of the camshaft 69.<br>
[0036]<br>
Accordingly, the exhaust valve 96 can be set in a state slightly lifted at the normal rotation of the camshaft 69, load in a compression stroke of the engine can be reduced. With the above-described structure, torque required for the starting of the crankshaft can be reduced, so that as a starter of the 4-cycle engine, small sized one can be employed. As a result, there are advantages that an area around the crank can be miniaturized and that a banking angle is possible to be enlarged. In the mean time, due to a normal rotation of the cam for a while, an outer shape of the decompression cam 98 returns inside of the outer peripheral shape of the exhaust cam.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the cylinder head 32, a pump chamber is formed surrounded by a water pump base 74 and a water pump housing 75. Inside the pump chamber 76, a pump shaft 78 having impellers 77 is arranged. The pump shaft 78 is fitted at the end section of the camshaft 69 and is freely rotatably held by means of a bearing 79. Driving force of the pump shaft 78 can be obtained by means of a pin 80 engaged with a central section of the cam<br><br>
sprocket 72. [0038]<br>
An air reed valve 94 is provided on a head cover 81. The air reed valve 94 improves emission by sucking air when generated negative pressure in the exhaust tube 97.

An automatic transmission for transmitting rotation of the engine 200 through shifting will be described.  Fig. 6 and Fig.7 show sectional views illustrating an automatic transmission portion of the engine, and Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 illustrate respectively a drive side and driven side thereof.<br>
[0040]<br>
In Fig. 6, a pulley 83 for winding a V-belt 82 is provided at the end section of the opposite side of the side where the inner rotor 15 of the starting/generating device is provided. The pulley 83 is constituted of a stationary pulley peace 83a fixed movement in a rotational and axial direction relative to the crankshaft 12 and a movable pulley piece 83b freely slidable in a axial direction relative to the crankshaft 12. A holder plate 84 is mounted on a back surface of the movable pulley piece 83b. that is, a face not brought into contact with the V-belt 82 . The holder plate 84 is integrally rotated with a crankshaft 12 by being regulated its movement both in the rotational and axial direction. A blank space surrounded by the holder plate 84 and the movable pulley piece 83b forms a pocket for storing<br><br>
a roller  85  as  a governor weight.<br>
[0041]<br>
On the other hand, a clutch mechanism for transmitting the power to rear wheels 21 is constituted as follows. In Fig. 7, a main shaft 125 of a clutch is supported by a bearing 127 fitted in a case 126 and a baring 129 fitted in a gearbox 128. A fixed pull^y piece 132a of a pulley 132 is supported by bearings 130 and 131 on the main shaft 125. A clutch plate 134 in a cup shape is fixed at the end section of the main shaft 125 by means of a nut 133.<br>
[0042]<br>
A movable pulley piece 132b of the pulley 132 is provided freely slidably in a longitudinal direction of the main shaft 125 on a sleeve 135 of the fixed pulley piece 132a.  The movable pulley piece 132b is engaged with a disk 136 so as to be integrally rotated in an area around the main shaft 125. A compression coil spring 137 for acting repulsive force in a direction enlarging a distance between the disk 136 and the movable pulley piece 132b is provided between them.  Further, a shoe 139 supported freely rockably by a pin 138 is provided on a disc 13 6. The shoe 13 9 is rockably moved in an outer peripheral direction by the action of centrifugal force when a revolutionary speed of the disk 136 increases, and the shoe 139 is brought into contact with an inner periphery of a crutch plate 134.  Incidentally, a spring 140 is provided so as the shoe 139 to be brought into contact with the crutch plate 134 when revolutionary speed of the disk 13 6 arrives at a predetermined revolutionary speed.<br><br>
[0043] A pinion 141 is fixed to the main shaft 125 and the pinion<br>
141	is brought in mesh with a gear 143 fixed to an idle shaft<br>
142	. Further, a pinion 144 fixed to the idle shaft 142 is brought<br>
in mesh with a gear 146 of an output shaft 145. A rear wheel<br>
21 is constituted of a rim 21a and a tire 21b fitted in a periphery<br>
of the rim 2la, and the ;rim 21b is fixed to the output shaft<br>
145.        '^[0044]     ';<br>
In the above-described constitution, in a case where engine speed is minimum, the roller 85 is positioned illustrated in a solid line in Fig. 6  and the V belt 82 is wound on a minimum diameter portion of the pulley 83.  The movable pulley piece 132b of the pulley 132 is biased to a position of a solid line in Fig. 7 energized by the compression coil spring 137, and the V-belt 82 is wound on the maximum diameter potion of the pulley 132.  Under this condition, since the main shaft 125 of an a centrifugal clutch is rotated at minimum revolutionary speed, centrifugal force applied to the disk 136 is minimum and the shoe 139 is drawn into inward by means of the spring 140, therefore the shoe 139 is never brought into contact with the crutch plate 134. After all, rotation of an engine is not transmitted to the main shaft 125, therefore the wheel 21 is not rotated.<br>
[0045]<br>
On the other hand, in a case where engine speed is large, the roller 85 is biased in an outer peripheral direction by centrifugal force. A position illustrated in a two-dots chain<br><br>
line in Fig. 6 is the position of the roller 85 when the rotation is at the maximum revolutionary speed. When the roller 85 is biased to the outer peripheral direction, since the movable pulley 83b is pushed to the side of a fixed pulley 83a, the V-belt 82 moves close to the maximum diameter side of the pulley 83. Thereby, on a centrifugal clutch side, the movable pulley piece 132b is biased in overcoming the compression coil spring 137, the V-belt 82F.moves close to the minimum diameter side of the pulley 132. Accordingly the centrifugal force applied to the disc 136 is increased, the shoe 139 is overhung outward in overcoming the spring i40 and is brought into contact with the clutch plate 134 . As a result, rotation of engine is transmitted to the main shaft 125, and the power is transmitted to the wheel 21 via a gear train. Thus, according to the speed of the engine, wound diameters of th^ v belt 82 with respect to the pulley 83 of the side of the crankshaft 12 and with respect to the pulley 132 of the side of the centrifugal crutch are changed, thereby a shift operation can be realized.<br>
[0046]<br>
As descried above, at the time of starting the engine, the engine can be energized by carrying a current to the starting coil 51, however in the present embodiment, a kick starting device for starting the engine 200 by means of a depressing operation by a foot is used in combination with a current carrying method.<br>
Further, the kick-starting device will be described with reference to Fig. 6. A driven dog gear 86 for kick starting<br><br>
is fixed to a rear face of the fixed pulley 83a. On the other hand, a support shaft 88 having a helical gear 87 is freely rotatably supported on the side of the cover 36. A cap 89 is fixed to the end section of the support shaft 88. A drive dog gear 90 brought into mesh with the driven dog gear 86 is formed at the end face of the cap 89. [0048]'<br>
Further&gt;.\a kick shaft 27 is freely rotatably supported in the cover 36, a sector helical gear brought into mesh with the helical gear 87 is welded to the kick shaft 27. A spline is formed at the end section of the kick shaft 27, that is, at a portion protruded to the outer section from the cover 36 and a spline provided on the kick arm 28 (refer to Fig. 7) is engaged with this spline- In the mean time, numerals 92 and 93 denote return springs. [0049]<br>
In the above-described constitution, when a kick pedal 29 is depressed by a foot, the kick shaft 27 and the sector helical gear 91 is turned in overcoming the return spring 93. The helical gear 88 and the sector helical gear 91 are set their mutual twisting direction of both the gears toward to generate thrust force for energizing the support shaft 87 to the side of the pulley 83, when the sector helical gear is turned by the depression of the kick pedal. Accordingly, when the kick pedal 29 is depressed, the support shaft 87 is biased to a side of the pulley 83, the drive dog gear 90 formed at the end surface of the cap 89 is brought in mesh with the driven dog gear 86. As a result, the crankshaft 12 is rotated, and the engine is<br><br>
possible to be started. When the engine is started, the repression of the kick pedal is weakened, and when the sector helical gear 91 is reverse rotated by means of the return springs 92 and 93, engagement of the drive dog gear with the driven dog gear is released.<br>
[0050]<br>
Next, a supply system of lubricating oil will be described with reference to Fig. 8. An oil supply section is provided at the lower section of the crankcase 9.

Oil sucked into the trochoid pump 149 is increased its pressure and discharged to a pipe line 150, passing through a pipe line 150 following the arrow mark D2 and D3, and delivered into the crankcase.<br>
[0051<br>
Here, a gear 152 is coupled to a pump shaft 151 of the trochoid pump 149, further, the gear 152 is brought in mesh with a gear 61 coupled with the crankshaft 12. Namely, the trochoid pump 149 is driven according to the rotation of the crankshaft 12 and oil for lubrication is circulated.<br>
[0052]<br>
As described above, in the present embodiment, a sprocket 59 for driving the camshaft 69 and a gear 61 for driving an oil pump are mounted on the crankshaft 12 adjacent to the baring 11 supporting the crankshaft 12. Further, the inner rotor 15 including the permanent magnet 19 are arranged at the position in proximity to these sprocket 59 and the gear 61, that is, at<br><br>
the position not far from the baring 11. Especially, the<br><br>
governor weight 55 of the governor mechanism automatically<br>

[0053]<br>
Next, an arrangement of a sensor for outputting a crank pulse will b^ described. Pig. 9 shows a sectional side elevation view of an eiSreia around the crankshaft illustrating the arrangement of a \sensor (a crank pulsar) for emitting a crank pulse. Fig. 10 shows an elevational view in section.<br>
[0054]<br>
The crankcase is constituted of a front crankcase 99F and a rear crankcase 99R, a crank pulsar 153 resides on the side of the rear crankcase 99R, and provided so as to cross at right angle with the crankshaft 12. Further, a detection end section 153a of the pulsar 153 is arranged opposing to an outer peripheral edge of a left crank web 12L. A protrusion section, that is, a reluctor section 154 is formed on an outer periphery of the left crank web 12L, the crank pulsar 153 is magnetically coupled with the reluctor section 154 and outputs a detection signal of a crank angle.<br>

Further, except after the first engine starting, the idling can be permitted according to intention ian  idle switch is turned ON) of the driver.    "^\ [0057]<br>
On the other hand, in the "stopping and starting mode" for restricting the idling, an engine is automatically stopped when a vehicle is stopped and when accelerator is operated at the stopping state of the engine, the engine is automatically restarted and the start of the vehicle is possible to be realized.<br>

[0059]<br>
A starting/generating device 250 coaxially provided with the crankshaft 12 is constituted of a starter motor 171 and an AC generator section (ACG) 172, generated electric power by the ACG 172 is charged into the battery 168 via a regulator rectifier 167. The regulator rectifier 167 controls output voltage of the starting/generating device 250 in a range from 12V to 14.5V.<br><br>
The battery 168 supplies a drive current to a starter motor 171 when a starter relay 162 is electrically conducted and supplies load currents to various general electric equipments 174 and a main control system 160 or the like via a main switch 173. [0060]<br>
. To the main control system 160, there are connected: an Ne sensor 153 for detecting engine speed Ne; an idling switch 253 for perm^sting or restricting manually the idling of the engine 200; the seating switch 254 for outputting an "H" level by closing a contact when the driver sits a seat; a vehicle speed sensor 255 for detecting vehicle speed; a standby indicator 256 flashes ON and OFF in the "stopping and starting mode"; a throttle sensor 257 ( including a throttle switch 257a) for detecting a throttle opening degree 6 ; the starter switch 258 for starting the engine 200 by driving a starter motor 171; a stop switch 259 for outputting a "H" level in response to a brake cooperation; a battery indicator 276 for alarming a driver shortage of charging in a battery by turning ON a light when the voltage of the battery 168 becomes lower than the predetermined value (for example 10 V) ; and a water temperature sensor 155 for detecting cooling water temperature of the engine circulated by a water pump 159. The water pump 159 is a mechanical pump to be driven by being transmitted the rotational motion of the engine 200. [0061]<br>
An ignition conti-ql system iincluding an ignition coil) 161 for igniting an ignition plug 65 synchronizing with rotation of the crankshaft 12,control terminal of the starter relay<br><br>
162 for supplying power to the starter motor 171, a control Ipterminal of a head light driver 163 for supplying power to a head light 169, and a control terminal of a by-starter relay 164 for supplying power to a by-starter 165 mounted on a carburetor 166 are further connected to the main control system 160.  The head light driver 163 is constituted of a switching element such as FET,   the switching element is interrupted at a predetermined period and a duty ratio to substantially control applying voltage to the head light 169, that is, a chopping control is adopted.<br>
[0062]<br>
Fig. 12 to 15 shows a block diagram. Nol, No2, No3, and No4 illustrating functionally constitution of the main control system 160. Reference numerals the same as those of in Fig. 11 shows the same or equivalent portions<br>
[0063]<br>
Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 show views to tabulate and display respective control contents of a starter relay control section 400 for constituting the main control system 160, a by-starter control section 900, a standby indicator control section 600, the head light control section 800, after starting non-seating control section 100, an ignition control section 700, an ignition nock control section 200, and charging control section 500.<br>
[0064]<br>
In Fig. 12, in an operation switching section 300, an operation mode of the main control system 160 is switched to either of the "starting and idling switch mode" or the "stopping<br><br>
and starting mode" when a state of an idle switch 253 and state of the vehicle are in a predetermined condition. [0065]<br>
To an operation mode signal output section 301 of the operation switching section 300, a state signal of an idling switch 253 is inputted. The state signal of the idling switch 253 shows a '^L" level in an OFF state (in restricting idling) , and shows a ^'ij' level in an ON state (in permitting idling) . An operation mode signal output section 301 outputs the operation mode signal S301 in response to an out put signal of the idle switch 253, the vehicle speed sensor 255, and the water temperature sensor 155, designating an operation mode of the main control switch 160 either of the "starting and idling switch mode" and the "stopping and starting mode".<br>
[0066].<br>
Fig. 18 shows a view typically illustrated a switching condition of the operation mode by means of the operation mode signal output section 301, when an main switch 173 is closed and the main control system 160 is reset (a condition 1 is established) , the operation signal S301 is made in an "L" level and the "starting and idle switch mode" is started.<br>
[0067]<br>
Further, in this " starting and idling switching mode", a vehicle speed equal to or more than a predetermined speed (for example, 10 Km per hour) is detected, when water temperature is equal to or more than a predetermined reference temperature (for example, temperature at which it is predicted that warm-up has been completed) and an idling switch is turned OFF (a<br><br>
condition 2 is established), the operation mode signal S301 is transferred from "L" level to "H" level and the "starting and idling SW mode" is started.<br>
[0068]<br>
Further, in the "stopping and starting mode", when an idle switch is turned "ON" from "OFF" (a condition 3 is established) , the operation mode signal^SBOl is transferred from the "H" level to "L" level,^ai^d the operation mode is returned to the "starting and idling switching mode" from the "stopping and starting mode" . Further, in either of the "stopping and starting mode" or the "starting and idling switching mode" , when an main SW173 is shut off {a condition 4 is established) , it is turned into OFF state.<br>
C0069]<br>
In returning to Fig. 12, in a stoppage time crank angle control section 1000, the starter motor 171 is rotated reverse by preset time when the engine stopped, and thereby the engine is made to stop at the desired crank angle position.<br>
[0070]<br>
A stoppage determining timer 1001 monitors the Ne sensor 153, when a state that there are no output from the Ne sensor is continued during predetermined time TX, a timeout signal ("H" level) is outputted. The timeout signal indicates engine stoppage. The timeout signal of the stoppage determining timer 1001 are inputted to an AND circuit 1002, an AND circuit 1007, and a reversal permission timer 1004.<br>
[0071]<br>
A reversal permission timer 1004 responds to the time out signal from the stoppage determining timer 1002 and maintains<br><br>
a reversal permission signal in "H" until time Tback is elapsed. The reversal permission time Tback is a function of cooling water temperature of the engine, the higher the water temperature, the shorter the time is selected. [0072]<br>
In a comparison section 1003, reference engine speed Nref set larger than cranking revolutionary speed and smaller than idling revolutionary speed is compared with engine speed Ne based on an output of the Ne sensor 153. When the engine speed Ne is equal to or more than the reference engine speed Nref, the signal "L" is outputted for indicating an engine state ON. Further, when the engine speed Ne is less than the reference engine speed Nref, the signal "H" for indicating the engine state OFF is outputted. An output signal from the comparison section 1003 is inputted to an AND circuit 1002.<br>
[0073]<br>
An out put signal of the AND circuit 1002 and the reversal permission timer 1004 and the timeout signal of the stoppage determining timer 1001 are inputted to an AND circuit 1005, the AND circuit 1005 outputs a logical product of these output signals, and the logical product are inverted by a inverter and supplied to a reversal relay 162a.<br>
[0074]<br>
Further, the output signal of the reversal permission timer 1004 is inputted to an AND circuit 1007. To another input of the AND circuit 1007, the timeout signal of the stoppage determining timer lOO1 is inputted. An output signal of the AND circuit 1007 is inputted to an OR circuit 406 of the starter<br><br>
relay control section 400. Further, a control content of a stoppage time crank angle control section 1000 descried above, is disclosed in the Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication Hll-117107 applied by an applicant of the present invention, therefore the description of them are omitted. [0075] According to a stoppage time crank angle control like this, in a case where the crankshaft is once inverted and after that normally rotates and engine is started, following reversal time previously set corresponding to rotational friction of the engine, the crankshaft is inverted. Accordingly, a crank angle position when the crankshaft is inverted and stopped, in short, reversal time can be set so that the normal starting position becomes a position where a compression upper dead center can be gotten over with small torque in normal rotation. [0076]<br>
The starter relay control section 400, in Fig. 12, starts the starter relay 162 under a predetermined condition according to the respective operation mode. A detection signal of the Ne sensor 153 is inputted to a determining section of not more than cranking revolutionary speed 401 and a determining section of not more than idling revolutionary speed 407. The determining section of not more than cranking revolutionary speed 401 outputs an "H" level signal when engine speed is equal to or lower than a predetermined cranking revolutionary speed (for example 600rpm) . The determining section of not more than idling revolutionary speed 407 outputs an "H" level signal when engine speed is equal to or lower than a predetermined idling<br><br>
revolutionary speed (for example 1200rpin) . 10077]<br>
An AND circuit 402 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the determijiing section of not more than cranking revolutionary speed 401, a state signal of the stop switch 259. and a state signal of the starter switch 258. An AND circuit determining section of not more than idling revolutionary speed 407. a detection signal of the throttle switch 257a, and a state signal of the seating switch 254. An AND circuit 403 outputs a logical product of ^n output signal of the AND circuit 402 and a reversal signal of an operational mode signal S301. An AND circuit 405 outputs the output signal of the AND circuit 404 and an operational mode signal S301.  The OR circuit 406 outputs a logical sum of the AND circuit 4 03 and 405 to the starter relay 162.<br>
[0078]<br>
According to a starter relay control like this, the AND circuit 403 becomes an Enable state under the "starting and idle switch mode" . Accordingly, the starter relay 162 is electrically conducted and the starter motor 171 is started when the starter switch 258 is turned ON by a driver (an output of the AND circuit 402 becomes "H" level.) while an engine speed is equal to or lower than cranking revolutionary speed and the stop switch 259 is in an turned ON state (during brake operation). [0079]<br>
Further, in the "stopping and starting mode", the AND circuit 405 becomes in an enable state. Accordingly, the<br><br>
starter relay 162 is electrically conducted and the starter motor 171 is started when a throttle is opened (an output of the AND circuit 404 becomes "H" level) when an engine speed is equal to or lower than idling revolutionary speed, and the seating switch 254 is in a turn ON state (during a driver is sitting on a seat). [00801'<br>
In a s^a^dby indicator control section 600 in Fig. 13, a detection signaKL of the vehicle speed sensor 255 is inputted to a determining section of zero of vehicle speed 601. and the determining section 60i outputs an "H" level signal when vehicle speed is substantially o. The detection signal of the Ne sensor 153 is inputted to an Ne determining section 602, the Ne determining section 6o2 outputs the "H" level signal when an engine speed is lower tljan a predetermined value. An AND circuit 603 outputs a logical product of the output signals of respective determining section 6oi and 602. [0081]<br>
An AND circuit 6Q4 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the AND circuit 603 and a reversal signal of the seating switch 254. An AND C3,rcuit 605 outputs a logical product of the output signal of the AND circuit 603 and the output of the seating switch 254 . A lighting/flashing ON-OFF control section 606 emits a lighting signal when an output signal of an AND circuit 604 is in an "H" level, and emits a flashing ON-OFF signal when the output signa; is in a "L" level. An AND circuit 607 outputs a logical proquct of the output signal of the lighting/flashing ON-OFF control section 606 and the operation<br><br>
mode signal S301. A standby indicator 256 lights a lamp in response to a light signal, and flashes ON and OFF in response to a flashing ON and OPF signal. [00821<br>
According to a standby indicator control like this, as illustrated in Fig. 16, the stand by indicator 256 light a lamp when a driver is not seating on the seat while vehicle stoppage in the "stoppistig and starting mode", and flashes ON and OFF when a driver sits on a seat. Accordingly the driver can recognize the fact that a vehicle can start immediately only when opening an accelerator grip, even if an engine is in a stoppage condition, when the standby indicator 256 is in a flashing ON-OFF state. [0083]<br>
An ignition control section 7 00 in Fig. 13, permits or prohibits an ignition (Operation by means of an ignition control system 161 under a predetermined condition for every respective operation mode. [0084]<br>
A running determining section 701 discriminates whether a vehicle is in a running state or not on the basis of a detection signal of the vehicle Speed sensor 255 and outputs an "H" level signal when in the ruiining state. An OR circuit 706 outputs a logical sum of an output signal of the running determining section 701 and an output signal of the throttle switch 257a. An AND circuit 7 07 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the seating switch 254 and an output signal of the OR circuit 706. Accordingly, an Output of the AND circuit 707 constitutes an "H" level when a throttle is opened or vehicle speed is larger<br><br>
than zero and the driver sits on the seat. [0085]<br>
An AND circuit 7 02.outputs a logical product of the output signal of the seating switch 254, a reversal signal of the running determining section 7 01, and a reversal signal of the throttle switch 257a. A timer 703 outputs an input signal by retarding it a predetermined time (in this embodiment, three seconds). A-^ater temperature determining section 710 outputs a "L" level when temperature of cooling water detected by the water temperature sensor 155 exceeds a predetermined reference temperature, and outputs an "H" level when the temperature does not exceed the reference temperature. Reference temperature in the water temperature determining section 710 is set to temperature to be predicted to boil cooling water when the engine is immediately stopped, for example, it is set to 100°C.<br>
[0086]<br>
A NAND circuit 705 outputs in reversal a logical product of an output signal of the AND circuit 702. an output signal of a timer 703, and an output signal of a water temperature determining section 7lo. Accordingly, the output of the NAND circuit 705 constitutes a "L" level when the throttle is closed, a vehicle speed is 0, a state that a driver sits on a seat continues three seconds and cooling water temperature of an engine is below reference temperature.<br>
[0087]<br>
A moving contact of a switching circuit 708 is switched to a side of a NAND circuit 705 during the ignition control system 161 is under a ignition operation, during stoppage of the<br><br>
operation, the moving contact is switched to the side of an AND circuit 707. An OR circuit 709 outputs a logical sum of a reversal signal of the operation mode signal S301 and reversal signal of an output of a switching circuit 708 to the ignition control system 161. [0088]<br>
According to an ignition control section 700 of the above-described constitution, as illustrated in Fig. 17, since an output of the OR circuit 709 normally constitutes an "H" level under "starting and idling switch mode", an ignition control is always permitted. C0089]<br>
Contrarily to th^t, in the "stopping and starting mode", an ignition control is permitted when a vehicle is stopped and movement of an engine is automatically stopped under a condition that the throttle is opened while the driver sits on the seat, or a vehicle speed is larger than 0. On the other hand, when a vehicle is stopped from its running state, the ignition control is prohibited and the engine is automatically stopped on condition that seating of driver is detected and the cooling temperature is low. However under the condition that seating of driver is not detected or cooling water temperature is high, the ignition control i^ continuously permitted and the engine is not automatically stopped. [0090]<br>
As described abovg, in the present embodiment, in a case where seating of a driver can not be detected in spite of sitting on the seat due to trouble in the seating switch 254, since an<br><br>
engine is not automatically stopped even if a vehicle stopped from its running state, engine starting at vehicle starting becomes unnecessary. Accordingly, in a system permitting automatic starting of an engine on condition that the driver sits on the seat, even if a trouble occurs in the seating switch 254, no hindrance is caused for the running of a vehicle.<br>
(0(3911<br>
In addition, in the present embodiment, even if the other engine stopping conditions are established, when cooling water temperature is high, the engine is not automatically stopped and a water pump continues its operation, prevention of cooling water from boiling and quick cooling of the engine is possible to be realized.<br>
[0092]<br>
Further, according to the present embodiment, even if seating of a driver is detected when a vehicle is stopped from its running state, an ignition control is not immediately prohibited, but to prohibit it after elapse of a predetermined time (in the present embodiment 3 seconds). Accordingly, in temporary vehicle stoppage at a point of intersection, or in a case where a driver is in a seating state and a vehicle speed is substantially 0 further in making a vehicle U turn with a throttle opening degree is near to full close, an engine is possible to continue its starting.<br>
[0093]<br>
An ignition nock control section 200 in Fig. 13 prevents knocking from occurring for every respective operation mode by retarding ignition timing at a acceleration time compared with<br><br>
normal time. Especially, in the present embodiment, knocking IS perfectly prevented from occurring in a starting acceleration time which is intrinsic to a vehicle mounted with an engine automatic stop and start system by making large a retard amount at start acceleration time to accelerate from an engine stoppage state than a retard amount at a normal acceleration time from an engine rptating state,<br>
[0094].-<br>
Further, in^ the present embodiment, knocking is prevented from occurring at the starting time by retarding ignition timing more than normal time at restarting and starting time from an engine high temperature state.<br>
[0095]<br>
In an standard ignition timing determining section 207, standard ignition timing as an advanced angle (degree) from TDC (a compression upper dead center) is registered in advance as a function of an engine speed Ne and an throttle opening degree d . Fig. 19 shows a view illustrating a relationship between an engine speed Ne, a throttle opening degree 6 , and standard ignition timing, the advance angle is set 15 degrees (a advanced angle, degrees) until an engine speed reaches at 2500rpm, and the advanced angle is gradually increases according to an engine speed Ne around exceeding 2500rpm.<br>
[0096]<br>
An Ne determining section 201 set a normal acceleration signal Saccl as an "H" level when an engine speed Ne is 700rpm<ne and set a starting time acceleration signal sacc2 as an level when engine speed ne is></ne><br>
700rpm<ne in the mean time a lower limit value of an engine speed ne when generating starting acceleration signal sacc2 present embodiment is preferable to be set cranking revolutionary engine.></ne>
An acceleration determining section 205 outputs an "H" level acceleration detegtidn signal by determining that an acceleratiori^peration has been conducted when a rate of change A 0 of a throttl:© opening degree 6   detected by the throttle sensor 257 exceeds a predetermined value. A water temperature determining section 206 determines water temperature of cooling water of an engine on the basis of a detection signal of a water temperature sensor 155, sets a water temperature determination signal Stmpl as in "H" level when water temperature exceeds first, reference temperature (in the present embodiment 50^^, and sets a water temperature determination signal Stmp2 as an "H" level when water temperature exceeds a second reference temperature (in the present embodiment SO'C) . [0098]<br>
An AND circuit 202 outputs a logical product of a reversal signal of the normal acceleration signal Saccl, an acceleration detection signal, a water temperature determination signal, and an operation mode signal S301. An AND circuit 203 outputs a logical product of the starting time acceleration signal Sacc2, the acceleration detection signal, a water temperature determination signal Stmpl, and an operation mode signal S301. An OR circuit 208 outputs a logical sum of an output of the AND circuit 203 and the water temperature determination signal<br><br>
Stinp2.<br>
[00991<br>
An acceleration time ignition timing correction section 204 informs standard ignition timing (refer to Fig. 19) determined by the standard ignition timing determining section 207 to the ignition control system 161 when outputs of respective AND circuits 202 and 2 03 are- in a "L" level, that is, a vehicle is not in an^^celeration state, and engine temperature is low. The ignition control system 161 executes an ignition operation at ignition timing informed via acceleration time ignition timing correction section 204.<br>
[0100]<br>
Further, ignition timing is retarded to an advance angle 7 degree (advanced angle) in spite of a result of determination by the standard ignition timing determining section 207 as illustrated in broken line A in Fig. 20, when the output signal of the AND circuit 202 is in an "H" level, that is as illustrated in Fig. 17, when engine speed Ne is 700rpm<ne in the and idling sw mode an acceleration operation is conducted by a driver when water temperature exceeds first reference present embodiment .></ne>
[0101]<br>
On the other hand, ignition timing is retarded to 0 degree in spite of a result of determination by the ignition timing determining section 207 as illustrated in solid line B in Fig. 20, when an output signal of the AND circuit 208 is in an "H" level, that is, as illustrated in Fig. 17, when engine speed Ne is 700rpm<ne in the and starting mode an></ne><br>
acceleration operation is conducted by a driver, further when che output signal of the AND circuit 203 is in an "H" level since water temperature exceeds the first reference temperature, or water temperature exceeds the second reference temperature<br>
(80t:) .<br>
[0102]<br>
In th^ mean time, the acceleration ignition timing correction section 204 is provided with a counter 204a, immediately execTites retarded ignition, as described above, the predetermined number of times (in the present embodiment, 3 times), when the output of either of AND circuit 202 and 203 becomes in an "H" level, after that immediately restored to a normal ignition timing by mean of the standard ignition timing determining section 207.<br>
[0103]<br>
According to an ignition knock control like this, different retard amounts can be set at normal acceleration time from an middle speed rotational range and at starting acceleration time, a retard amount at the start acceleration time can be set larger than that of at normal acceleration time from the middle speed rotational range, knocking at the starting acceleration time can be prevented not only from that of the normal acceleration time from the middle speed revolutionary range. Further, at starting time in an engine temperature high state since ignition timing can be retarded more than at normal time in spite of an acceleration state, so that knocking can be prevented from occurring.<br>
[0104J<br><br>
In a head light control section 800 in Fig. 14, Ne - determining section 801 determines whether engine speed is more than a predetermined sej: engine speed (less than engine speed at the time of idling) or not on the basis of detected signal of the Ne sensor 153, an "H" level signal is outputted when the engine speed is equal to or more than the set engine speed. An AND circuit-^802 outputs a. logical product of an output signal of the Ne determining section 801 and a reversal signal of the operation mode signal S301. An AND circuit 803 outputs a logical product of an output signal of the Ne determining section 801 and the operational mode signal S301.<br>
[0105]<br>
A lighting/dimming switching section 804 outputs an "H" level signal when the output signal of the AND circuit 802 is in an "H" level, and outputs a pulse signal of a duty ratio 50% when it is in a "L" level. A lighting/multiple stage dimming switching section 8 05 outputs an "H" level signal when the output signal of the AND circuit 803 is in an "H" level, when it is in a "L" level, counts its duration time by a timer 805a and outputs a pulse signal gradually reducing a duty ratio according to duration time. In the present embodiment, the duty ratio is reduced from 95% to 50% step-by-step in 0.5sec to Isec. In this step-wise dimming method, since an amount of light decreases instantaneously and linearly, power saving and maintaining high commodity value can be achieved.<br>
[0106]<br>
According to a head light control like this, as illustrated in Fig. 16, in the "starting and idling SW mode"<br><br>
a head light is lighted or dimmed according to the engine speed Ne, in the "stopping and starting mode", the head light is lighted or step-wisely dimmed according to the engine speed Ne. Accordingly, discharge of a battery at a vehicle stoppage time can be restrained, while maintaining sufficient visibility from an on coming vehicle . As a result, a charging amount to a battery from a generator can be reduced at the starting time thereafter, since electrise load to the generator is decreased, thus acceleration performance at the time of starting is possible to be improved. [0107]<br>
In a by-starter control section 900 in Fig. 14, a detection signal of a water temperature sensor 155 is inputted to a water temperature determining section 901. The water temperature determining section 901 outputs an "H" level signal when water temperature is equal to or more than a first predetermined value (in the present embodiment 50°C) and closes a by-starter relay 164, when water temperature is equal to or below a second predetermined value (in the present embodiment 10°C) , outputs a "h"   level signal and opens the by-starter relay 164, [0108]<br>
According to a by-starter control like this. A concentration of fuel becomes thick when water temperature is high, and automatically becomes thin when temperature is low. Further, in the present embodiment, hysteresis is set to opening closing temperature of the by-starter relay 164, so that an unnecessary opening closing operation of the by-starter relay 164 which is liable to occur at critical temperature can be<br><br>
prevented.<br>
[0109]<br>
In the charging control section 500 in Fig. 14, a detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255 and a detection signal of the throttle sensor 257 are inputted to an acceleration operation detection section 502. as illustrated in Fig. 17, when vehicle speed is larger than 0, and the throttle is opened from a full closea"state to a full open state in 0.3 sec. or less, the control section 500 determines that the operation is an acceleration operation and generate an operation detection pulse.<br>
[0110]<br>
A charge restricting section 504 at acceleration time controls a regulator rectifiers 167 in response to the acceleration detection pulse signal, a charge voltage of the battery 168 is lowered to 12.0 V from 14.5 V at ordinary time,<br>
[0111]<br>
The acceleration time charge restricting section 504 further starts a six second timer 504a in response to the acceleration detection pulse, when this timer 504a times out, or the engine speed Ne is equal to or more than the set engine speed, or a throttle opening degree decreases, returns the charge voltage from 12.0V to 14.5V by releasing charge restriction.<br>
[0112]<br>
A detection signal of the vehicle speed sensor 255, a detection signal of the Ne sensor 153, and a detection signal of the throttle sensor 257 are inputted to a starting operation<br><br>
detection section 503, as illustrated in Fig. 17, when a throttle 'is opened on condition that vehicle speed is 0 and the engine speed Ne is lower than^the set engine speed (in the present embodiment 2500 rpm) , the detection section 503 determines that the operation is a starting operation and generate a starting detection pulse.<br>
[0113^<br>
A starting time charge restricting section 505, when detects the starting detection pulse signal, controls the regulator rectifier 167 and lowers the charging voltage of the battery 168 to 12.0V from 14.5V at a normal time.<br>
[0114]<br>
The starting time charge restricting section 505 further starts seven second timer 505a in response to the starting detection pulse, when this timer 505a times out, or the engine speed Ne is equal to or more than the set engine speed, or a throttle opening degree decrease, a charge voltages returns to 14.5V from 12.0V by releasing charging restriction.<br>
[0115]<br>
According to a charging control like this, in a case where a driver opens suddenly a throttle and accelerated rapidly, or at a starting time from a stopping state, a charge voltage is restrained low, electrical load of the starting/generating device 250 is temporally reduced. Accordingly, mechanical load of an engine 200 brought about by the starting/generating device 250 is reduced and improves accelerating performance.<br>
[0116]<br>
A non-seating control section after vehicle stoppage 100<br><br>
in Fig. 15, engine starting by means of the starter switch 258 originally prohibited is exceptionally permitted at a timing where driver empirically can start an engine by the starter switch.<br>
[0117]<br>
An AND circuit 102 outputs a logical product of an operational.niode signal S301 and a reversal signal of the seating switch 254 . A non-seating continuation determining section 101 is provided with a timer 101a, an "H" level of the AND circuit 102 is detected more than a predetermined time after automatic stoppage of the engine.  Namely, in the "stopping and starting mode", when no seating of driver is continued more than a predetermined time after automatic stoppage of the engine, an output signal is set to an "H" level. As a result, the ignition control system 161 is energized to be brought about in an ignition permission state.<br>
[0118]<br>
An OR circuit 103 outputs a logical sum of respective output of the starter switch 258 and the throttle switch 257a. An AND circuit 104 outputs a logical product of respective output signals of the non-seating continuation determining section 101 and the OR circuit 103 to the starter relay 162. That is to say, (an output signal of the non-seating continuation determining section is set in an "H" level) after non seating of a driver is continued equal to or more than a predetermined time after automatic stoppage of an engine in the "stopping and starting mode", when the starter switch 258 is turned ON, or the throttle is opened, the starter relay 162 is energized to<br><br>
irive the starter motor 171. As a result, the ignition control system 161 is energized by means of the non- seating continuation determining section 101., so that the engine is possible to be started.<br>
[0119]<br>
According to an after vehicle stoppage non seating control like this, engine starting is exceptionally permitted by means of the starter switch 258 when a non seating state of a driver is detected continuously for a predetermined time after stoppage of an engine in response to a predetermined vehicle stoppage condition. Accordingly, when a engine is automatically stopped at the time of vehicle stoppage and a driver goes away from a vehicle remaining as it is without shutting off a main power source, and after that a driver returned to the vehicle while forgetting that the engine has been under an automatic stop control, and even if the starter switch 258 is operated by the driver, engine can be started similarly as ordinary time.<br>
[0120]<br>
In addition, in the after stoppage non seating control, it is described that engine starting by means of the starter switch 258 can be exceptionally permitted on condition that after automatic stoppage of the engine in the "stopping and starting mode" and non seating of a driver is continued equal to or more than a predetermined time, however as illustrated in broken line in Fig. 15, engine starting by means of the starter switch 258 may well be permitted by controlling an operation switching section 300 and an operation mode is switched from the "stopping and starting mode" to the "starting and idling<br><br>
SW mode". Or illustrated in Fig. 18 as "a condition 5", by shutting off the main switch 173, engine starting by means of the starter switch 258 may well substantially be permitted. [Effect of the Invention] According^to the present invention, following effects will be sure to be achieved.<br>
(1)	Even if vehicle stop condi tions are established, when engine temperature is ^qual to or higher than a predetermined reference temperature, since an engine continues its rotation without being interrupted an ignition control of an engine and a water pump continuously operated, cooling water can be prevented from boiling, further, the engine is possible to be cooled quickly.<br>
(2)	When an engine is restarted and starts movement, since ignition timing of the engine is retarded when engine temperature is equal to or higher than a predetermined temperature, knocking is prevented from occurring.<br><br>
