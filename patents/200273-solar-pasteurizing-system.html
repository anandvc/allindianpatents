				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to solar pasteurizing system and in particular, an apparatus for purifying liquids including water by using solar energy. The present invention also relates to the storage and use of heat energy during hours without sun or with reduced sun. For example, the solar pasteurizing system of the present invention is capable of taking in contaminated water/natural water supply from borewells and municipal water with impurities and converts that into safe bacteria free drinking water.<br>
The  energy  emitted by the sun corresponds  to  a<br>
o high temperature of the order of 6000  C, and is emitted<br>
in the form of radiation which arrives at the earth with<br>
wavelength distribution comprising about 3%  ultraviolet<br>
rays,  42%  visible light rays, and about  55%  infrared<br>
rays. It is well known that surfaces exposed to the  sun<br>
collect at least to some degree the solar radiation  and<br>
that  the  absorption  of this radiation  results  in  a<br>
heating of the material constituting the surface. It  is<br>
also   known  that  electricity  can  be   produced   by<br>
photoelectric  devices exposed to the sun's rays.  There<br>
have  been  many  attempts in the past  to  collect  and<br>
utilize  pollution  free and  essentially  nonconsumable<br>
solar  energy to meet many energy needs. Much  attention<br><br>
has  been directed to the conversion and utilisation  of solar  energy in the past few years as other  fuels  are exhaustable  and that a burning of these fuels  produces pollution.   Solar  energy,  on  the  other   hand,   is inexhaustable  and  available  above the  clouds  at  an average  energy  level of approximately 1350  watts  per horizontal  square meter. A percentage of  this  energy, depending  on atmospheric and weather conditions,  dust, pollution, etc. is available at the surface of the earth during  periods of sunshine which vary upto  above  4000 hours per year depending on 1ocation.Even more recently, the  shortage of fossil fuels particularly oil  and  the high  cost thereof have sparked new attempts to  harness the energy of the sun.<br>
It may here now be mentioned that at present it is known to use a solar energy distillation apparatus in which a part of the heat of condensation of the condensing liquid is recovered. In the disclosed embodiments in said applications the heat of condensation is transferred to a fluid in a fluid lens. The fluid lens is disposed over the liquid to be distilled. It is observed that the focal distance and concentration of fluid lenses suitable for use in solar distillation  apparatus are competing factors.  A  large<br><br>
fluid lens is desirable to provide a high concentration factor but the focal distance of the fluid lens increases with its aperture. Moreover when distilling salt water, deposits of salts and minerals accumulates within lens requiring frequent cleaning thereof and can not produce heat at an economical capital investment such that the use of solar energy Is competitive with other energies.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a solar pasteurizing system which is novel in its construction and obviates all dis-advantages and drawbacks associated with the conventional solar energy distillation apparatus.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a solar pasteurizing system which is simple in its construction, works on a simple nature friendly principle without involving pesticides, preservatives and purifying water through solar route a hygienically water very safe for human consumption without any side effects.<br>
Another  object  of the present  invention  is	to<br>
provide a solar pasteurizing system which is elegant	in<br>
its appearance, cheaper in original costs, stronger	in<br>
its construction and lighter in its weight.<br><br>
Yet another *,„JDw,, ui ma present invention is to provide  a solar pasteurizing system which is  available<br>
in  various sizes, say 100,200,300, 	,50000,  10,000<br>
etc.  litres  per  day  to any  size  depending  on  the requi rements.<br>
A still further object of the present Invention is to provide a solar pasteurizing system which is also having an electrical backup to suffice the needs on weak or irregular sunlight days.<br>
Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a solar pasteurizing system which is totally resistant to atmospheric corrosion, having flexible foam type rubberized insulation on all pipes and fitting and other system components are fitted with thermocol, fibre glass and like cladding and the same are to prevent/ reduce heat losses in the system.<br>
Keeping the above objects in mind, the present invention thus provides a solar pasteurizing system comprising of flat plate solar collector with selectively coated absorber panel, connected by system piping to insulated retainer via a temperature controller/sensor and a solenoid valve, said retainer in turn is connected by piping to pasteurizing unit having two  inlets and two outlets and is connected  by  system<br><br>
piping  to  water treatment plant and  said  flat  plate solar collector unit.<br>
The said solar pasteurizing system of the present invention may be made of stainless steel, special metal or the like non-rigid and resilient material and may be configured into any geometric shape depending upon requirement and/or choice.<br>
Unlike other types of known solar energy distillation apparatus, the solar pasteurizing system of the present invention is capable of being assembled/ disassembled very easily and is available in various sizes.<br>
The solar pasteurizing system of the present invention is also totally resistant to atmospheric corrosion. It cannot rust and moreover, the solar collectors are B.l.S MSI) certified.<br>
For a better understanding of the nature of this invention and to show how the same may be carried in to effect (function), reference will be made to the accompanying  drawing;<br>
Figure 1 : Shows the schematic view of the solar pasteurizing system according to the present invention.<br><br>
Referring now to the accompanying drawing, the solar pasteurizing system of the present invention as indicated by reference to figure 1, the components of which are non-corrosive comprises of flat plate solar water collector (1) having selectively coated absorber panel which is made of copper sheet, copper riser tubes, copper headers, end flages etc., this panel is optimally designed as per BIS specifications to absorb maximum energy of solar radiation, the collector box is made from anodized al1uminium sections with alluminium back sheet, glazing and water tight fixing arrangement, said collector (1) is connected by system piping («) via a temperature controller/sensor (6) and a solenoid valve (/) to insulated retainer (4) vessel of SS-304 which is generally rectangular in shape fabricated from SS-304 sheet with inlet, outlet, drain etc., insulated properly and cladding is provided to reduce the heat transfer losses, said retainer in turn is connected by system piping (8) to pasteurizing unit (5) with two inlets and two outlets specially designed to meet the requirement of required capacity of the system and is a plate type heat exchanger fabricated to transfer heat from hot water coming from retainer by cold water coming from water treatment plant 
 <br>
vessel with charged geolite rasin which reduces the salts content of water coming from any source of water including contaminated one to make it soft as per the BIS specification of drinking water IS 10500, it may be noted that the geolite rasin bed has normal life of three years and may be recharged, moreover in case of higher fluoride contents a separate defIouridator is used to reduce fluoride to a sate limit as per Bib specification of drinking water.<br>
All  the  above components of the  system  as	per<br>
their functional requirements and ease of operation	are<br>
supported  and located by M.S.angles and  structure	(2)<br>
not shown in figure.<br>
It may here also be indicated that the outer surface of piping and other system components are insulated using flexible foam type rubberized insulations and components are provided with thermocol, fibre glass and suitable cladding so as to prevent and reduce heat losses in the whole system.<br>
Now to show how the solar pasteurizing system of the present invention may be carried into effect or function, reference is again made to figure.1, wherein any source of water including contaminated one is allaowed  to enter in the water treatment  plant,  where<br><br>
the water is treated to make it soft by charged geolite resin bed and def1uoridetor as per BIS specifications for drinking water I.S. 10500, the soft and potable water then enters the pasteurizing unit where it gain temperature by transfer of heat from hot water coming from retainer, the water thereafter fed to flat plate collector for further heating through solar energy.The flat plate collector absorbs solar radiation and subsequently transfer this thermal energy tothe water which is flowing through headers and risers thus increasing the water temperature to reduce the heat losse, the absorber panel is enclosed in a box with toughened glass glazing at the top end insulation on the bottom end sides. To make the operating process automatic, the controller along with sensor is designed and used in the solar pasteurizing system. Temperature sensor is provided to sense the temperature of hot water near outlet of flat plate collector. Once the temperature is reached to a predecided temperature, the sensor gives signal of reaching this temperature to a controller. Once controller receives a signal from sensor of achieving pre-decided temperature, controller activities solenoid valve and valve gets energised and opens the passage allowing the hot water to flow from collector to retainer where it is retained for about 5 to  10  minutes  to  eliminate  harmful  bacteria   like<br><br>
'Escherichia Coli', 'Shigella' bacteria and the 'Rotavirus' group of viruses the most common causes of diahoria, hacterium which causes cholera as well as worms like cryptos-poridium, Giardia and Entamoeba. The said retainer is insulated properly and cladding is provided to reduce the heat transfer losses to minimum in the vessel. The hot water is then finally fed to pasteurizing unit to transfer heat to cold water coming from water treatment plant said earlier. The unit thus is used to cool hot water and bring temperature to almost atmospheric temperature so that this water oan be supplied for direct drinking purpose.<br>
