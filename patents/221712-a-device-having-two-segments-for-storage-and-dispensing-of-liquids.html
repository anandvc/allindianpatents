29/4/200<br><br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to device for storage and dispensing of liquids. By way of example, but without implying any limitation, the device of the present invention may advantageously be employed for storage and dispensing of liquids such as oil, milk, water and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Edible Oil is mostly packed in plastic blown jars or bottles, metal cans and plastic film pouches. Oil in plastic film pouches has become popular due to its economy. Pouch film is normally formed from mono or co-extruded film or laminate with polyester or any such material. Oil is then filled by manual or automatic pouch filling machine or any other such machine. Sealing of open end-side or central seal of the pouch completes the filling operation. A dispensing action in the above-mentioned pouches is effected by providing a cut in its top corner so as to allow the oil to be dispensed there from.<br>
Several distinct disadvantages are associated with the known pouches. One such disadvantages is that it is difficult to pour oil in a bottle or container without spillage and loss of oil, apart from being a messing operation. Another disadvantage is that the bottle or container may not be hygienic or may not give better shelf life. Yet another disadvantage is that although a pouch is provided for storing oil for its shelf life, yet it is discarded immediately after emptying with the result that the full benefits of the capability of pouch to store oil upto the shelf life of oil, cannot be derived. A still further disadvantage is that the pouch cannot keep oil fresh for a long time once opened.<br><br><br>
Further disadvantage of the known pouch is that after opening, its contents are emptied in another container and the pouch is discarded with the result that brand name of the oil is lost immediately after opening the pouch.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to propose a device for storage and dispensing of liquids, which allows the liquid to be stored in pouch itself even after dispensing a quantity of the liquid thereform.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a device for storage and dispensing of liquids which enables controlled dispensing of the liquid therefrom, to a bottle or a container without dripping or spillage of the liquid, which is otherwise difficult to pour direct by from the pouch.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a device for storage and dispensing of liquids which minimizes the ingress of air into the pouch.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose a device for storage and dispensing of liquids which does not allow the liquid to come into contact with any other material and remains untouched by the user which enables hygienic handling of oil.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a device having two segments for storage and dispensing of liquid characterised in that:-<br>
-   two identical halves of device (1) hinged (5) along the length provided with a pouch (9) containing liquid;<br><br><br>
-	two handle halves (10, 11) forming a handle (2) when the device is snapped shut;<br>
-	two snaps (12, 1.3) provided under handle ends with projection for closing the device with male snap (12) tight fitting into the female snap (13) along the split line (4),.<br>
-	top and bottom having recess (3),<br>
â€”. two semi-circular cuts (8,8) with one semi-circular cut provided at the top end of each of the said halves of the device, along the hinged end which when the device is shut, form an opening (6) through which corner (7) of the pouch (9) inside the device, projects out and<br>
-	a clipping mechanism at the opening so as to reclose corner (7) of<br>
the pouch after being cut.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF FIGURES<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with the accompanying drawings which are intended to be an exemplary embodiment to illustrate the invention and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention. In the accompanying drawings:-<br>
Fig. 1: shows the device of the present invention in a book-opening condition wherein the two identical halves of device are raised open around a hinge.<br>
Fig.2: shows the device in closed condition with pouch corner projecting out of the opening of the device.<br>
Fig.3 shows another view the device with clearer view of the handle of the device.<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring to fig.l, the device (1) of the present invention enables a pouch (9) containing liquid like edible oil to be kept within the device, even after dispensing a certain quantity of liquid therefrom. The liquid can be directly dispensed from the pouch thus kept in the device, through an opening (6) provided in the device. The device preferably of oval shape having elliptical flat top and bottom surface, comprises of two identical halves hinged (5) at one side along the length of the device. The closing of two halves of the device is effected along the split line (4) (fig.2) by snapping the male snap (12) against the female snap (13). The snaps are provided under handle opening ends and are formed on 10mm from both top and bottom end of opening handle area. The edge of these snaps are formed by R15 fillet or preferably 2mm thickness. On right half side, these snaps have projections of 4mm formed by steps between Î¦ 4mm and Î¦ 6mm with 2mm each. These projections are designed to match with holes on left half in the same position with Î¦ 4mm holes in top and bottom end of handle opening area. Snaps (12,13) are designed to close tightly and open easily with fillet radius of 1mm. The two identical handle halves, with handle half (10) provided at-one unhinged end of the half of device (1) and other handle half (11) provided at other non-hinged end of the other half of device (1) constitute a handle (2) (fig.2) when the two halves of the device are snapped shut. The handle thus formed is an exact mirror image against hinge line and both the two halves of handle, match completely after closing the two halves of device (1). Effective handle grip formed is preferably 15mm which is as per ergonomics of grip to give maximum possible comfort in handling. Each half of the device (1) has a circular cut-out (8) at the top end of the device along the hinge (5) so that when device is closed, these cut-outs together form an opening (6) (fig.2). A recess (3) is provided symmetrically at the bottom of the device.<br><br><br>
Referring to fig.2, the said device in closed condition has an opening (6) through which the comer (7) of the pouch (9) kept within the device (1), projects out and can be cut with the scissor for directly pouring the liquid from the pouch. The opening is preferably 24.. mm wide and 122mm in height. This opening is formed with a radius of R17 mm to form smooth edge so that the consumer will never get hurt because of sharp open edge while placing pouch inside the device. A clipping mechanism is provided at the opening to reclose the pouch comer (7) after it has been cut with scissor  for dispensing a quantity of liquid from the pouch. This built-in clipping mechanism remains open while placing pouch corner and is used only after dispensing the oil for the purposes of closing the cut pouch comer. The dimension tolerance are maintained tight enough to tightly close the opened pouch corner.<br>
The fig.3 shows another view of he device of the present invention, showing clearly the handle (2) formed when the two halves of the device are closed by snapping male snap (12) against female snap (13). The outer periphery of handle (2) is reinforced by a surface formed by an ellipse of 36mm in width and 140mm in height. This offers strength to the handle and improves the visual appeal of the device.<br>
The device is injection moulded, one piece, made of preferably polypropylene. The outermost dimensions of the device are preferably 200mm in height and the top and bottom of the device are preferably elliptical in shape having width preferably 158mm and 86mm along major axis and minor axis respectively of elliptical surface. The flat top and bottom provide stability and ease in transportation and make the device convenient for storing. Preferably an overall wall thickness of 2mm is maintained uniformly on the entire body of the device for strength and economy of polypropylene material.<br>
