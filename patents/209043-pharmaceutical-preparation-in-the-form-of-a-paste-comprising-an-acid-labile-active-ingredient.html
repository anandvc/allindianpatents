PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION IN THE FORM OF A PASTE COMPRISING AN ACID-LABILE ACTIVE INGREDIENT;<br>
ALTANA PHARMA AG of BYK-GULDEN-STRASSE 2, D-78467 KONSTANZ, DEUTSCHLAND, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br>
GRANTED     ORIGINAL<br>
3-10-2006<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of pharmaceutical technology and describes a novel pharmaceutical preparation in the form of a paste comprising an acid-labile active ingredient, in particular an acid-labile proton pump inhibitor. The invention also relates to processes for producing the paste. The paste is particularly suitable for administering acid-labile active ingredients to animals or to people who have difficulty taking solid dosage forms such as tablets or capsules.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is generally known to coat oral dosage forms, e.g. tablets or pellets, which<br>
comprise an acid-labile active ingredient, with an enteric coating which, after<br>
passing through the stomach, rapidly dissolves in the alkaline medium in the<br>
Intestine. One example of such acid-labile active ingredients comprises acid-labile<br>
proton pump inhibitors (H+/K+-ATPase inhibitors), in particular pyridin-2-<br>
ylmethylsulfinyl-1H-benzimidazoles like those disclosed, for example, in EP-A-0 005<br>
129, EP-A-0 166287, EP-A-0 174 726 and EP-A-0 268 956. Because of their H+/K+-<br>
ATPase-inhibiting effect, they are important in the therapy of disorders originating<br>
from increased gastric acid secretion. Examples of active ingredients from this group<br>
which are already commercially available are 5-rnethoxy-2-[(4-methoxy-3,5-<br>
dimethyl-2-pyridinyl)methylsulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (INN: omeprazole), 5-<br>
difluoromethoxy-2-[(3,4-dimethoxy-2-pyridmyl)methylsulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole<br>
(INN:	pantoprazole),	2-[3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-2-<br>
pyridinyl)methylsulfinyl]-lH-benzimidazole (INN: lansoprazole) and 2-{[4-(3-methoxypropoxy)-3-methylpyridm-2-yl]methylsulfmyl}-lH-benzimidazole (INN: rabeprazole).<br>
Because of their great tendency to decompose in a neutral and, in particular, acidic environment, with production also of highly colored decomposition products, it is also necessary in this case for oral preparations to protect active Ingredients from the effect of acids. With the very acid-labile pyridin-2-ylmethylsulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles it is additionally necessary for them to be processed In the tablet core or in pellets in the form of their alkaline salts, for example as sodium salts, or<br><br>
together with alkaline substances. Since substances suitable for enteric coatings are those with free carboxyl groups, the problem arises that the enteric coating is, because of the alkaline medium In the Interior, partially or even completely dissolved from inside, and the free carboxyl groups promote decomposition of the active Ingredient. It is therefore necessary to provide a sealing intermediate layer (subcoating) between the enteric coating and the alkaline tablet core or pellet. EP-A-0 244 380 proposes that cores which contain the active Ingredient together with alkaline compounds or as alkaline salt be coated with at least one layer which is soluble in water or rapidly disintegrates in water and is composed of nonacidic, inert pharmaceuticalry acceptable substances, before the enteric layer is applied. The Intermediate layer or intermediate layers act as pH-buffering zones in which hydrogen ions diffusing in from outside are able to react with the hydroxyl ions diffusing out of the alkaline core. In order to increase the buffer capacity of the intermediate layer, it is proposed to incorporate buffer substances into the intermediate layer(s). By this process it is possible in practice to obtain reasonably stable preparations. However, relatively thick intermediate layers are required in order to avoid the unsightly discolorations which occur even with only slight decomposition. In addition, considerable effort must be invested to avoid traces of moisture during production.<br>
The administration of solid dosage forms such as capsules or tablets proves to be problematic especially in animals or patients who have difficulties with swallowing, such as, for example, elderly people and small children.<br>
W094/25070 describes an oral pharmaceutical preparation comprising a proton pump inhibitor in the form of a paste for treating acid-related gastric disorders in animals. For this purpose, enteric coated particles (such as tablets or beads) which comprise a proton pump inhibitor either are mixed with dry gelling agents, and this mixture is then mixed with water immediately before administration, or the enteric particles are mixed with potassium or calcium salts and mixed immediately before administration with a low-viscosity solution of a polymeric gel-forming agent. An alternative proposal is to mix enteric coated particles immediately before administration with a low-viscosity solution of a gel-forming agent in the form of a<br><br>
temperature-sensitive polymer, and to heat the solution cautiously. The preparations described herein have the disadvantage for the user, however, that the paste must be prepared immediately before administration.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,708,017 and WO00/50038 describe an oral pharmaceutical preparation which is ready for use and comprises omeprazole in the form of a paste for treating acid-related gastric disorders in humans and animals. This preparation in paste form comprises omeprazole, basifying agents, a thickener and a hydrophobic, oily liquid vehicle. The hydrophobic oily liquid vehicle comprises a vegetable oil and tri-glycerides of medium chain length fatty acids or propylene glycol diesters of medium chain length fatty acids. According to WO00/50038, these preparations are stable and can be used to fill syringes which can then be used directly for administering the active ingredient to an animal.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present Invention to provide a paste for the oral administration of acid-labile active Ingredients which can be produced without great technical complexity, which is stable and not sensitive to moisture and displays good controllability of active Ingredient delivery. It ought also to be possible to produce the paste ready for use. Another object of the invention is also to provide a paste for the oral administration of acid-labile active ingredients, where it is unnecessary to protect the acid-labile active ingredient by an enteric coating.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that this object can be achieved by a pharmaceutical preparation where a plurality of Individual active ingredient units are dispersed in a gel-like base composed of one or more pharmaceutical excipients, where the acid-labile active Ingredient is present in the individual active ingredient units in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one solid paraffin and one or more substances from the group of fatty alcohol, triglyceride and fatty acid ester.<br>
The invention therefore relates to a pharmaceutical preparation where a plurality of individual active Ingredient units are dispersed in a gel-like base composed of one or more pharmaceutical excipients, where the acid-labile active ingredient is present in<br><br>
the individual active ingredient units in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one solid paraffin and one or more substances from the group of fatty alcohol, triglyceride and fatty acid ester.<br>
The invention further relates to a pharmaceutical preparation in paste form for oral administration of an acid-labile active ingredient where a plurality of individual active ingredient units are dispersed in a gel-like base composed of one or more pharmaceutical excipients, where the acid-labile active ingredient is present in the individual active ingredient units i) in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one fatty alcohol and at least one solid paraffin, ii) in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one triglyceride and at least one solid paraffin or iii) in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one fatty acid ester and at least one solid paraffin.<br>
The paste is preferably ready for use. The gel-like base is preferably water-based. The pharmaceutical preparation of the invention can be produced without great technical complexity. Technically complicated processes for applying enteric layers and Intermediate layers are unnecessary. In addition, the controllability of active ingredient delivery from the paste is observed to be good. Surprisingly, good chemical and physical stability is observed even for a paste ready for use which is based on an aqueous gel base. Extemporaneous production of the paste before use is therefore unnecessary.<br>
Further subject matters are evident from the claims.<br>
The numerous individual active ingredient units (also referred to hereinafter as preparations) for the purposes of the invention comprise numerous individual units in which at least one active ingredient particle, preferably a plurality of active ingredient particles, is present in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one solid paraffin and one or more substances from the group of fatty alcohol, triglyceride and fatty acid ester. A plurality of active ingredient particles is preferably present i) in a matrix composed of a mixture comprising at least one fatty alcohol and at least one solid paraffin, ii) in a matrix composed of a mixture of at least one triglyceride and at least one solid paraffin or iii) in a matrix composed of a mixture of at least one fatty acid ester and at least one solid paraffin. The active<br><br>
ingredient is preferably present in essentially uniform distribution, in particular homogeneously dispersed or dissolved, in the matrix. The active ingredient units are preferably microspheres.<br>
The active ingredient units of the invention are distinguished in particular by high stability, an active ingredient release which can be controlled via the particle size and composition of the matrix, good flow characteristics, good processability and a uniform delivery of active ingredient. It is particularly worthy of mention that the active ingredient units of the invention can be further processed to the paste without thereby losing a given functionality (such as taste masking, resistance to gastric juice, slowing of release) in the gel-like base. In contrast to prior art pastes for acid-labile active ingredients it is also possible to produce stable pastes ready for use which are based on aqueous gel-like bases with the active ingredient units of the invention. The particle size of the individual units is advantageously less than or equal to 2 mm, preferably 50-800 [mu]m, particularly preferably 50-700 [mu]m and very particularly preferably 50-600 [mu]m. Microspheres with a particle size of 50-500 [mu]m, particularly preferably of 50-400 [mu]m, are preferred. Mono-modal microspheres with a particle size of 50-400 [mu]m, particularly preferably of 50-200 [mu]m, are particularly preferred.<br>

Further acid-labile proton pump inhibitors, for example substituted<br>
phenylmethylsulfinyl-1H-benzimidazoles,	cycloheptapyridin-9-ylsulfinyl-lH-<br>
benzimidazoles or pyridin-2-ylmethylsulfinylthienotmidazoles are disclosed in DE-<br>

The acid-labile proton pump inhibitors are chiral compounds. The term "acid-labile proton pump inhibitor" also encompasses the pure enantiomers of the acid-labile proton pump inhibitors and their mixtures in any mixing ratio. Pure enantiomers which may be mentioned by way of example are 5-methoxy-2-[(S)-[(4-methoxy-3,5-dimemyl-2-pyridmyl)memyl]sulfiriyl]-lH-benzimidazole (INN: esomeprazole) and (S)-pantoprazole[(-)-pantoprazole].<br>
The acid-labile proton pump inhibitors are moreover present as such or, preferably, in the form of their salts with bases. Examples of salts with bases which may be mentioned are sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium salts. If the acid-labile proton pump inhibitors are isolated in crystalline form, they may contain variable amounts of solvent. The term acid-labile proton pump inhibitor therefore also represents according to the invention all solvates, in particular all hydrates, of the acid-labile proton pump inhibitors and their salts. Such a hydrate of the salt of an acid-labile proton pump inhibitor with a base is disclosed, for example, in WO91/19710.<br>

Examples of fatty alcohols which may be mentioned are cetyl alcohol, myristyl alcohol, lauryl alcohol or stearyl alcohol, with preference for cetyl alcohol. It is also possible if desired for mixtures of fatty alcohols to be present.<br><br>
The triglyceride is glycerol with its three hydroxyl groups esterified by carboxylic acids. The carboxylic acids are preferably monobasic carboxylic acids with 8 to 22 carbon atoms, preferably natufally occurring carboxylic acids. It is possible in this case for the carboxylic acids to be different or, preferably, identical. Examples which may be mentioned are trisftearate, tripalmitate and, particularly preferably, trimyristate (these triglyceridesg are commercially available under the name Dynasan 118, 116 and 114 respectively). It is also possible if desired for mixtures of tiglycerides to be present.<br>
The fatty acid ester is the ester of an alcohol with a fatty acid. The alcohol in this case is preferably a linear, saturated or unsaturated primary alcohol with 10-30, preferably with 12 to 18, carbon atoms. The fatty acid is preferably a monobasic carboxylic acid with 8 to 22, in particular 12 to 18, carbon atoms, preferably a naturally occurring carboxylic: acid. Fatty acid esters preferred according to the invention have a melting point above 30[deg.] C. Examples of fatty acid esters which may be mentioned are cetyl palmitate, which is commercially available for example under the name Cutina(R) CP. It is also possible * desired for mixtures of fatty acid esters to be present.<br>
The solid paraffin is preferably paraffinum solidum (ceresin). It is also possible alternatively to use ozokerite/ for example. It is also possible if desired to use mixtures.<br>
If desired, the mixtures in the individual active ingredient units may include one or more other pharmaceutically suitable excipients. Other suitable excipients which may be mentioned by way of example are polymers, sterols and basic compounds.

Stearylamine and sodium stearate may be mentioned as preferred. The addition of basic compounds to the mixtures In the individual units results In particularly stable preparations and prevents possible discolorations.<br>

Preferred individual active ingredient units of the invention consist of 2-70% active ingredient, 10-60% fatty alcohol, 10-60% solid paraffin, 1-15% polymer and 0.1-2% of a basic compound. Further preferred individual active ingredient units of the invention consist of 2-70% active ingredient, 10-60% triglyceride, 10-60% solid paraffin, 1-15% polymer and 0.1-2% of a basic compound. Other preferred individual active ingredient units of the invention consist of 2-70% active ingredient, 10-60% fatty acid ester, 10-60% solid paraffin, 1-15% polymer and 0.1-2% of a basic compound.<br>
Particularly preferred individual active ingredient units of the invention consist of 5-40% active ingredient, 20-60% fatty alcohol, 10-60% solid paraffin, 1-15% polymer and 0.1-1% of a basic compound. Further particularly preferred individual active ingredient units of the invention consist of 5-40% active ingredient, 20-60% triglyceride, 10-60% solid paraffin, 1-15% polymer and 0.1-1% of a basic compound. Other particularly preferred individual active ingredient units of the invention consist of 5-40% active ingredient, 20-60% fatty acid ester, 10-60% solid paraffin, 1-15% polymer and 0.1-1% of a basic compound.<br>
Examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 5-40% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 10-40% cetyl alcohol, 5-60% solid paraffin, 1-5% polymer and 0.1-0.2% of a basic compound. Further examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 5-40% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 10-40% glyceryl tripalmitate, 5-60% solid paraffin, 1-5% polymer and 0.1-0.2% of a basic compound. Other examples of active ingredient units of the invention contain 5-40% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 10-40% glyceryl tripalmitate, 5-60% solid paraffin, 1-5% polymer and 0.1-0.2% of a basic compound. Still other examples of active ingredient units of the Invention contain 10-20% pantoprazole sodium sesquihydrate, 20-40% triglyceride, 40-70% solid paraffin, 1-5% sterol and 0.05-0.1% of a basic compound.<br>
The Individual active ingredient units can be produced for example by spray drying or, preferably, by spray solidification, in particular also by spray prilling. Production is particularly preferably by prilling, in particular by vibration prilling.<br><br>
The individual active ingredient units are preferably produced by spray solidification or by prilling, production very particularly preferably being by vibration prilling.<br>
For the spray solidification or prilling expediently the fatty alcohol, the triglyceride and/or the fatty acid ester is liquefied together with the solid paraffin and, if desired, other excipients to give a clear melt. The active ingredient is dissolved or dispersed in this solution, and the resulting solution or dispersion is sprayed or, preferably, prilled in a suitable apparatus. A dispersion of the active ingredient in a melt of the excipients is preferably used.<br>
Spray solidification takes place in a manner known per se. A detailed description of this technique is to befound in P. B. Deasy, Microencapsulation and Related Drug Processes (1984).<br>
The individual active ingredient units are particularly preferably produced by solidification from liquid phase by generating drops by means of vibrating nozzles and by solidifying the drops which are formed, after they have stabilized, by drying or cooling in a suitable medium (preferably gaseous or liquid). The suitable medium may be, for example, cooled gas such as air or nitrogen. Processes of this type and corresponding apparatuses are disclosed in DE 27 25 924, EP 0 467 221, W099/33555 and WO00/24382. It is particularly preferred in this connection for the liquid phase flowing to the nozzle to be kept at a constant temperature. The solidification preferably takes place by instantaneous cooling In a suitable cooling medium. In prilling, moreover it is preferred for the liquid phase flowing to the nozzle, the vibrating nozzle and the drops formed by prilling to be kept at a constant temperature until their spherical shape has stabilized, and for the solidification of the drops after their stabilization to be carried out instantaneously by cooling with a gaseous or liquid cooling medium. Systems suitable for prilling by means of vibrating nozzles are marketed, for example, by Brace GmbH, Alzenau, Germany. It is possible by means of prilling using vibrating nozzles to obtain the individual active Ingredient units in the form of microspheres with a narrow monomodal particle size spectrum in the particle size range from 50 μm to 2 mm. The narrow monomodal  particle  size  spectrum  and  the  uniform  spherical  shape  of the<br><br>
microspheres obtained in this way are expected to result in a uniformly smooth surface, a uniform, defined delivery of active ingredient and, in relation to passage through the stomach in the case of oral dosage forms (owing to the small particles), a behavior like that of a solution. The microspheres of the Invention are distinguished In particular by high stability, a release of active ingredient which can be controlled via the particle size and composition of the matrix, good flow characteristics, good processability and a uniform delivery of active Ingredient. It is particularly worthy of mention that the microspheres can be further processed to the paste without thereby losing a given functionality (such as taste masking, resistance to gastric juice, slowing of release) in the gel-like base. In contrast to prior art pastes for acid-labile active ingredients It is also possible to produce stable pastes ready for use which are based on aqueous gel-like bases with the active ingredient units of the invention. The microspheres are preferably monomodal microspheres with a particle size range of 50-800 μm, preferably 50-500 μm, particularly preferably 50-400 μm, in particular 50-200 μm. The microspheres preferably comprise an acid-labile proton pump inhibitor.<br>
The particle size of the active ingredient employed in the spray drying or spray<br>
solidification, prilling or vibration prilling is advantageously less than or equal to<br>
100 μm, in particular less than 40 μm. The particle size is preferably in the range 1-20<br>
μm, particularly preferably in the range 3-15 μm. Such a particle size can be<br>
achieved, for example, by grinding the active ingredient in a suitable mill.<br>
The Individual active Ingredient units (preparations) of the invention can then be<br>
further processed together with suitable excipients to the paste of the invention.<br>
Suitable excipients are, in particular, those excipients normally used to produce<br>
paste bases. Particularly suitable according to the invention are excipients normally<br>
used to produce gel-like paste bases, such as gel formers. Gel formers are substances<br>
which form gels with a dispersant such as water. Examples of gel formers of the<br>
invention are sheet silicates, carrageenans, xanthan, gum acacia, alginates, alginic<br>
acids, pectins, modified celluloses or poloxamers. Examples of sheet silicates are<br>
Veegum or bentonites. Examples of modified celluloses are carboxymethylcellulose,<br>
ethylcellulose,	methylcellulose,	hydroxypropylcellulose	or<br><br>
methylhydroxypropylcellulose. A mixture of two or more different gel formers is also possible if desired. The proportion of gel former is, based on the preparation ready for use, usually according to the invention from 0.05 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 15% by weight and very preferably 0.4 to 10% by weight. The proportion of individual ingredient units in the paste ready for use is usually according to the invention from 0.01 to 30% by weight, preferably 0.1 to 20% by weight and very preferably 0.5 to 15% by weight.<br>
Other suitable excipients which may be present in the dosage form of the invention are, for example, flavoring substances (for example flavors or sweeteners), buffer substances, preservatives or suitable hydrophilic additives. Suitable hydrophilic additives which can be employed and which may be mentioned are glycerol, polyethylene glycols and propylene glycols. Hydrophilic additives are advantageously added in amounts of up to 20% by weight.<br>
The proportions of gel former(s), active ingredient units and other excipients are preferably adjusted so that a paste with a viscosity between 1 000 and 200 000 mPa.s (determined with a rotational viscometer) is obtained.<br>
The paste of the invention is produced by techniques known to the skilled worker, for example by introducing the individual active Ingredient units into a dispersion of the gel former and, where appropriate, of additives in water or by introducing the gel former into a dispersion of the individual active ingredient units in water. It is also possible if desired to prepare dry mixtures of active Ingredient units and excipients, to which a dispersant such as water is added only immediately before use.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations of the invention in paste form are administered in amounts which contain the acid-labile active ingredient in a dose usual for treating the particular disorder. The acid-labile proton pump inhibitors of the invention can be employed for the treatment and prevention of all disorders regarded as treatable or preventable by the use of pyridin-2-ylmethylsulfinyl-lH-benzimidazoles. In particular, the pastes of the invention can be employed for treating gastric disorders in animals (such as horses and camels) and in humans. As mentioned above, the paste of the invention is particularly suitable for oral administration of the active<br><br>
ingredient to people who have problems with swallowing solid oral forms, such as elderly people or children. For administration to humans, the pastes of the invention are administered in amounts which contain between 1 and 500 mg, preferably between 5 and 60 mg, of an acid-labile proton pump inhibitor. Examples which may be mentioned of amounts of the pastes of the invention which are to be administered are those containing 10, 20,40 or 50 mg of pantoprazole. The daily dose (for example 40 mg of active ingredient) can be administered, for example, in the form of a single dose or by several doses of the pastes of the invention (for example 2 x 20 mg of active ingredient). The total volume of paste for an administration unit is advantageously from 0.5 to 5 ml. For administration to animals, the pastes of the invention are administered in amounts which are suitable for treating the particular animal. The amounts administered for administration to horses are those containing between 0.1 and 20 g, preferably between 0.2 and 10 g, of an acid-labile proton pump inhibitor. The total volume of paste in an administration unit for horses is advantageously from 5 to 50 ml. The paste of the invention is preferably provided in a special pack which can also at the same time aid administration. Examples which may be mentioned are applicators such as syringes, tubes or bags, especially flat bags such as four-seam or three-seam flat bags, for example made of plastic sheets. A suitable flat bag is disclosed, for example, in EP 705 204. Compared with solid oral forms, the paste of the invention has the advantage that it can be taken by the patient very simply and anywhere, because Intake is possible without water, for example directly from a flat bag. The paste of the Invention is preferably administered to animals using a syringe, for example by introducing the paste into the mouth of the animal (buccally) or onto the base of the tongue.<br>
The pastes of the invention can be combined with other medicaments, either in different combinations or in a fixed combination. Combinations worthy of mention in connection with the dosage forms of the invention which comprise acid-labile proton pump inhibitors as active Ingredients are those with antimicrobial active ingredients and combinations with NSAlDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Particular mention should be made of the combination with antimicrobial agents like those employed for controlling the microbe Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori).<br><br>
Examples of suitable antimicrobial active ingredients (active against Helicobacter pylori) are described in EP-A-0 282 131. Examples of antimicrobial agents which are suitable for controlling the microbe Helicobacter pylori and may be mentioned by way of example are bismuth salts [e.g. bismuth subcitrate, bismuth subsalicylate, ammonium bismuth(III) potassium citrate dihydroxide, bismuth nitrate oxide, dibismuth tris(tetraoxodialuminate)], but especially [beta]-lactam antibiotics, for example penicillins (such as benzylpenicillin, phenoxymethylpenicillin, propicillin, azidocillin, dicloxacillin, flucloxacillin, oxacillin, amoxicillin, bacampicillin, ampicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin or azlocillin), cephalosporins (such as cefadroxil, cefaclor, cefalexin, cefixime, cefuroxime, cefetamet, ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, cefotetan, cefazoline, cefoperazone, ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefamandole, cefepime, cefoxitin, cefodizime, cefsulodin, ceftriaxone, cefotiam or cefmenoxime) or other [beta]-lactam antibiotics (e.g. aztreonam, loracarbef or meropenem); enzyme inhibitors, for example sulbactam; tetracyclines, for example tetracycline, oxytetracycline, minocycline or doxycycline; aminoglycosides, for example tobramycin, gentamicin, neomycin, streptomycin, amikacin, netilmicin, paromomycin or spectinomycin; amphenicols, for example chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol; lincomycins and macrolide antibiotics, for example clindamycin, lincomycin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, spiramycin, roxithromycin or azithromycin; polypeptide antibiotics, for example colistin, polymixin B, teicoplanin or vancomycin; gyrase inhibitors, for example norfloxacin, cinoxacin, ciprofloxacin, pipemidic acid, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, pefloxacin, fleroxacin or ofloxacin; nitroimidazoles, for example metronidazole; or other antibiotics, for example fosfomycin or fusidic acid. Particularly worthy of mention in this connection is the administration of an acid-labile proton pump inhibitor together with the combination of a plurality of antimicrobial active ingredients, for example with the combination of a bismuth salt and/or tetracycline with metronidazole or the combination of amoxicillin or clarithromycin with metronidazole and amoxicillin with clarithromycin.<br><br>
