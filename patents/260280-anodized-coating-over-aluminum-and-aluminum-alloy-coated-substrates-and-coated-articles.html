ANODIZED COATING OVER ALUMINUM AND ALUMINUM ALLOY COATED<br>
SUBSTRATES AND COATED ARTICLES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001.]	This invention relates to the anodization of ferrous metal substrates<br>
that have a coating of predominantly aluminum alloy (e.g. GalvalumeÂ®) or aluminum to provide corrosion-, heat- and abrasion- resistant coated articles.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002.]	Ferrous metal articles having a coating of metals that are dissimilar<br>
to the iron in the substrate on their surfaces have found a variety of industrial applications. The dissimilar metal coatings are typically comprised of aluminum either alone or aluminum in combination with other metals, such as zinc. This dissimilar metal coating provides corrosion protection to the ferrous metal substrate, but is itself subject to corrosion over time. Because of the dissimilar metal coating's tendency toward corrosion and environmental degradation, it is beneficial to provide the exposed surfaces of these metal articles with a secondary corrosion-resistant and protective coating. Such secondary coatings should resist abrasion so that the secondary and dissimilar metal coatings remain intact during use, where the metal article may be subjected to repeated contact with other surfaces, particulate matter and the like. Heat resistance is also a very desirable feature of a secondary protective coating. Where the appearance of the coated ferrous metal article is considered important, the secondary protective coating applied thereto should additionally be uniform and decorative.<br>
[0003.]	In order to provide an effective and permanent protective coating on<br>
aluminum and its alloys, such metals have been anodized in a variety of electrolyte solutions, such as sulfuric acid, oxalic acid and chromic acid, which produce an alumina<br><br>
coating on the substrate. While anodization of aluminum and its alloys is capable of forming a more effective coating than painting or enameling, the resulting coated metals have still not been entirely satisfactory for their intended uses. The coatings frequently lack one or more of the desired degree of flexibility, hardness, smoothness, durability, adherence, heat resistance, resistance to acid and alkali attack, corrosion resistance, and/or imperviousness required to meet the most demanding needs of industry.<br>
[0004.]	Anodization of ferrous metal substrates coated with an aluminum or<br>
aluminum alloy according to processes of the prior art results in an aluminum oxide coating that is brittle and requires subsequent sealing to provide a significant increase in corrosion protection. It is taught in the prior art that only certain metals, such as aluminum, magnesium, titanium and zinc, can be successfully anodized. It is also taught that electrically non-conductive substances, such as plastic, refractory materials and the like cannot be anodized.<br>
[0005.]	Thus, there is still considerable need to develop alternative coating<br>
processes for non-conductive .articles and ferrous metal articles having an aluminum or aluminum alloy metal coating which do not have any of the aforementioned shortcomings and yet still furnish corrosion-, heat- and abrasion-resistant protective coatings of high quality and pleasing appearance.<br>
[0006,]	It will often be desirable to provide an anodized coating that not only<br>
protects the metal surface from corrosion but also provides a decorative white finish so that the application of a further coating of white paint or the like can be avoided. Few anodization methods are known in the art to be capable of forming a white-colored decorative finish with high hiding power on aluminum-coated ferrous metal substrates, for example.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0007.]	Ferrous metal articles having a coating of aluminum or aluminum<br>
alloy, for example aluminum-zinc alloys, may be rapidly anodized to form protective coatings that are resistant to corrosion and abrasion using anodizing solutions containing complex fluorides and/or complex oxyfluorides. The anodizing solution is aqueous and comprises one or more components selected from water-soluble and water-dispersible complex fluorides and oxyfluorides of elements selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Al, Ge and B. The use of the term "solution" herein is not meant to imply that every component present is necessarily fully dissolved and/or dispersed. Some anodizing solutions of the invention comprise a precipitate or develop a small amount of sludge in the bath during use, which does not adversely affect performance.   In especially preferred embodiments of the invention, the anodizing solution comprises one or more components selected from the group consisting of the following:<br>
a)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible phosphorus oxysaits, wherein the phosphorus concentration in the anodizing solution is at least 0.3M;<br>
b)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible complex fluorides of elements selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Al, Ge and B;<br>
c)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible zirconium oxysaits;<br>
d)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible vanadium oxysaits;<br>
e)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible titanium oxysaits;<br>
f)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible alkali metal fluorides;<br>
g)	water-soluble and/or water-dispersible niobium salts;<br>
h)  water-soluble and/or water-dispersible molybdenum salts; i)   water-soluble and/or water-dispersible manganese salts; j)    water-soluble and/or water-dispersible tungsten salts; and k)  water-soluble and/or water-dispersible alkali metal hydroxides.<br><br>
[0008.]	In another embodiment of the invention, niobium, molybdenum,<br>
manganese, and/or tungsten salts are co-deposited in a ceramic oxide film of zirconium and/or titanium.<br>
[0009.]	The method of the invention comprises providing a cathode in<br>
contact with the anodizing solution, placing the article as an anode in the anodizing solution, and passing a current through the anodizing solution at a voltage and for a time effective to form the protective coating on the surface of the article. Pulsed direct current or alternating current is preferred. When using pulsed current, the average voltage is preferably not more than 250 volts, more preferably, not more than 200 volts, or, most preferably, not more than 175 volts, depending on the composition of the anodizing solution selected. The peak voltage, when pulsed current is being used, is desirably not more than 600, preferably 500, most preferably 400 volts. In one embodiment, the peak voltage for pulsed current is not more than, in increasing order of preference 600, 575, 550, 525, 500 volts and independently not less than 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400 volts. When alternating current is being used, the voltage may range from about 200 to about 600 volts. In another alternating current embodiment, the voltage is, in increasing order of preference 600, 575, 550, 525, 500 volts and independently not less than 300, 310, 320, 330, 340, 350, 360, 370, 380, 390, 400 volts.<br>

Practice within the numerical limits stated is generally preferred, however. Also, throughout the description, unless expressly stated to the contrary; percent, "parts of, and ratio values are by weight or mass; the description of a group or class of materials as suitable or preferred for a given purpose in connection with the invention implies that mixtures of any two or more of the members of the group or class are equally suitable or preferred; description of constituents in chemical terms refers to the constituents at the time of addition to any combination specified in the description or of generation in situ within the composition by chemical reaction(s) between one or more newly added constituents and one or more constituents already present in the composition when the other constituents are added; specification of constituents in ionic form additionally implies the presence of sufficient counterions to produce electrical neutrality for the composition as a whole and for any substance added to the composition; any<br><br>

[0020.]	The workpiece to be subjected to anodization in accordance with the<br>
present invention is comprised predominantly of a material other than aluminum or magnesium. This material can be ferrous metal, non-ferrous metal or a non-metallic material, provided that, after coating with the first protective coating, the material does not interfere with the electrical conductivity of the article required for anodic reactions. The workpiece or article additionally comprises a first protective coating comprising aluminum or an aluminum, preferably aluminum-zinc, alloy. By way of non-limiting example, suitable substrates include aluminized steel which comprises a steel substrate having a first protective coating of aluminum thereon and aluminum-zinc alloy coated steel, e.g. GALVALUMEÂ® a 55% Al-Zn alloy coated sheet steel manufactured and sold by International Steel Group, Dofasco Inc., United States Steel Corp., and Wheeling-Nisshin, Inc. Other examples are manufactured and sold by Steelscape Inc. under the registered trademark ZincalumeÂ®, by Industrias Monterrey S.A. under its trademark Zintro-Alumâ¢and by Galvak SAde under its trademark Galvalâ¢.<br><br>
[0021.]	In one embodiment, the first protective coating is a metal that<br>
contains not less than, in increasing order of preference, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100% by weight aluminum. In an another embodiment if is preferred that the first protective coating comprise an alloy wherein the amount of aluminum is preferably not less than 30% by weight, and is not more than 70% by weight, most preferably 40 to 60 wt%. In a third embodiment, the first protective coating is predominantly comprised of zinc, and aluminum comprises not more than 10 wt%, 7 wt% or 5 wt%.<br>
[0022.]	In carrying out the anodization of a workpiece, an anodizing solution<br>
is employed which is preferably maintained at a temperature between about 0Â°C and about 90Â° C. It is desirable that the temperature be at least about, in increasing order of preference 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50Â°C and not more than 90, 88, 86, 84, 82, 80, 75, 70, 65Â°C.<br>
[0023.]	The anodization process comprises immersing at least a portion of<br>
the workpiece having a first protective coating in the anodizing solution, which is preferably contained within a bath, tank or other such container. The article having a first protective coating (workpiece) functions as the anode. A second metal article that is cathodic relative to the workpiece is also placed in the anodizing solution. Alternatively, the anodizing solution is placed in a container that is itself cathodic relative to the workpiece (anode). When using pulsed current, an average voltage potential not in excess of in increasing order of preference 250 volts, 200 volts, 175 volts, 150 volts, 125 volts is then applied across the electrodes until a coating of the desired thickness is formed on the surface of the article in contact with the anodizing solution. The result is an article having a substrate that is typically not amenable to anodization, for example ferrous metal or non-metallic substrate, which now has at least one surface comprising a protective coating that includes an anodized layer comprising oxides of metals from the anodizing solution.   When certain anodizing solution compositions are used, good results may be obtained even at average voltages not in excess of 100 volts. It has been observed that the formation of a corrosion-<br><br>
and abrasion-resistant protective coating is often associated with anodization conditions which are effective to cause a visible light-emitting discharge (sometimes referred to herein as a "plasma", although the use of this term is not meant to imply that a true plasma exists) to be generated (either on a continuous or intermittent or periodic basis) on the surface of the article.<br>
[0024.]	It is desirable that the current be pulsed or pulsing current. Direct<br>
current is preferably used, although alternating current may also be utilized (under some conditions, however, the rate of coating formation may be lower using AC). The frequency of the current may range from about 10 to 10,000 Hertz.<br>
[0025.]	In a preferred embodiment, the current is a nominal square wave<br>
form. The "off" time between each consecutive voltage pulse preferably lasts between about 10% as long as the voltage pulse and about 1000% as long as the voltage pulse. During the "off" period, the voltage need not be dropped to zero (i.e., the voltage may be cycled between a relatively low baseline voltage and a relatively high ceiling voltage). The baseline voltage thus may be adjusted to a voltage that is from 0% to 99.9% of the peak applied ceiling voltage. Low baseline voltages (e.g., less than 30% of the peak ceiling voltage) tend to favor the generation of a periodic or intermittent visible light-emitting discharge, while higher baseline voltages (e.g., more than 60% of the peak ceiling voltage) tend to result in continuous plasma anodization (relative to the human eye frame refresh rate of 0.1-0.2 seconds). The current can be pulsed with either electronic or mechanical switches activated by a frequency generator. The average amperage per square foot is at least in increasing order of preference 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 105, 110, 115, and not more than at least for economic considerations in increasing order of preference 300, 275, 250, 225, 200, 180: 170, 160, 150, 140, 130, 125. More complex waveforms may also be employed, such as, for example, a DC signal having an AC component. Alternating current may also be used, with voltages desirably between about<br><br>
200 and about 600 volts. The higher the concentration of the electrolyte in the anodizing solution, the lower the voltage can be while still depositing satisfactory coatings.<br>
[0026.]	A number of different types of anodizing solutions may be<br>
successfully used in the process of this invention, as will be described in more detail hereinafter. However, it is believed that a wide variety of water-soluble or water-dispersible anionic species containing metal, metalloid, and/or non-metal elements are suitable for use as components of the anodizing solution. Representative elements include, for example, phosphorus, titanium, zirconium, hafnium, tin, germanium, boron, vanadium, fluoride, zinc, niobium, molybdenum, manganese, tungsten and the like (including combinations of such elements). In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the components of the anodizing solution are titanium and /or zirconium.<br>
[0027.]	Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is thought that the<br>
anodization of ferrous metal articles having a dissimilar metal coating in the presence of complex fluoride or oxyfluoride species to be described subsequently in more detail leads to the formation of surface films comprised of metal/metalloid oxide ceramics (including partially hydrolyzed glasses containing O, OH and/or F ligands) or metal/non-metal compounds wherein the metal comprising the surface film includes metals from the complex fluoride or oxyfluoride species and metals from the dissimilar metals comprising the first protective coating. The plasma or sparking which often occurs during anodization in accordance with the present invention is believed to destabilize the anionic species, causing certain ligands or substituents on such species to be hydrolyzed or displaced by O and/or OH or metal-organic bonds to be replaced by metal-0 or metal-OH bonds. Such hydrolysis and displacement reactions render the species less water-soluble or water-dispersible, thereby driving the formation of the surface coating of oxide that forms the second protective coating. In situ generation of oxygen peroxides and oxygen radicals in the area of the anode is also thought to contribute to the hydrolysis of the complex.<br><br>
. [0028.]	The anodizing solution used comprises water and at least one<br>
complex fluoride or oxyfluoride of an element selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Al, Ge and B (preferably, Ti and/or Zr). The complex fluoride or oxyfluoride should be water-soluble or water-dispersible and preferably comprises an anion comprising at least 1 fluorine atom and at least one atom of an element selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Al, Ge or B. The complex fluorides and oxyfluorides (sometimes referred to by workers in the field as ufluorometallates") preferably are substances with molecules having the following general empirical formula (I):<br>
HpTqFrOs (I) wherein; each of p, q, r, and s represents a non-negative integer; T represents a chemical atomic symbol selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Alt Ge, and B; r is at least 1; q is at least 1; and, unless T represents B, (r+s) is at least 6. One or more of the H atoms may be replaced by suitable cations such as ammonium, metal, alkaline earth metal or alkali metal cations (e.g., the complex fluoride may be in the form of a salt, provided such salt is water-soluble or water-dispersible).<br>
[0029.]	Illustrative examples of suitable complex fluorides include, but are<br>
not limited to, H2TiF6, H2ZrF6, H2HfF6, H2GeF6, H2SnF6, H3AIF6 ,and HBF4 and salts (fully as well as partially neutralized) and mixtures thereof. Examples of suitable complex fluoride salts include SrZrF6, MgZrF6, Na2ZrF6 and Li2ZrF6, SrTiF6, MgTiF6, Na2TiF6 and U2TIF6.<br>
[0030.]	The total concentration of complex fluoride and complex oxyfluoride<br>
in the anodizing solution preferably is at least about 0.005 M. Generally, there is no preferred upper concentration limit, except of course for any solubility constraints. It is desirable that the total concentration of complex fluoride and complex oxyfluoride in the anodizing solution be at least 0.005, 0.010, 0.020, 0.030, 0.040, 0.050, 0.060, 0.070, 0.080, 0.090, 0.10, 0.20, 0.30, 0.40, 0.50, 0.60 M, and if only for the sake of economy be not more than, in increasing order of preference 2.0,1.5, 1.0, 0.80 M.<br><br>
[0031.]	To improve the solubility of the complex fluoride or oxyfluoride,<br>
especially at higher pH, it may be desirable to include an inorganic acid (or salt thereof) that contains fluorine but does not contain any of the elements Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, Al, Ge or B in the electrolyte composition. Hydrofluoric acid or a salt of hydrofluoric acid such as ammonium bifluoride is preferably used as the inorganic acid. The inorganic acid is believed to prevent or hinder premature polymerization or condensation of the complex fluoride or oxyfluoride, which otherwise (particularly in the case of complex fluorides having an atomic ratio of fluorine to "T of 6) may be susceptible to slow spontaneous decomposition to form a water-insoluble oxide. Certain commercial sources of hexafluorotitanic acid and hexafluorozirconic acid are supplied with an inorganic acid or salt thereof, but it may be desirable in certain embodiments of the invention to add still more inorganic acid or inorganic salt.<br>
[0032.]	A chelating agent, especially a chelating agent containing two or<br>
more carboxylic acid groups per molecule such as nitrilotriacetic acid, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid, N-hydroxyethyl-ethylenediamine triacetic acid, or diethylene-triamine pentaacetic acid or salts thereof, may also be included in the anodizing solution. Other Group. IV compounds may be used, such as, by way of non-limiting example, Ti and/or Zr oxalates and/or acetates, as well as other stabilizing ligands, such as acetylacetonate, known in the art that do not interfere with the anodic deposition of the anodizing solution and normal bath lifespan. In particular, it is necessary to avoid organic materials that either decompose or polymerize without desirable effect in the energized anodizing solution.*<br>
[0033.]	Suitable complex oxyfluorides may be prepared by combining at<br>
least one complex fluoride with at least one compound which is an oxide, hydroxide, carbonate, carboxylate or alkoxide of at least one element selected from the group consisting of Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, B, Al, or Ge. Examples of suitable compounds of this type that may be used to prepare the anodizing solutions of the present invention include, without limitation, zirconium basic carbonate, zirconium acetate and zirconium hydroxide. The<br><br>
preparation of complex oxyfluorides suitable for use in the present invention is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,282, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. The concentration of this compound used to make up the anodizing solution is preferably at least, in increasing preference in the order given, 0.0001, 0.001 or 0.005 moles/kg (calculated based on the moles of the e)ement(s) Ti, Zr, Hf, Sn, B, Al and/or Ge present in the compound used). Independently, the ratio of the concentration of moles/kg of complex fluoride to the concentration in moles/kg of the oxide, hydroxide, carbonate or alkoxide compound preferably is at least, with increasing preference in the order given, 0.05:1, 0.1:1, or 1:1.<br>
[0034.]	A pH adjuster may be present as in the anodizing solution, suitable<br>
pH adjusters include, by way of nonlimiting example, ammonia, amine, alkali metal hydroxide or other base. The amount of pH adjuster is limited to the amount required to achieve the desired pH and is dependent upon the type of electrolyte used in the anodizing bath. In a preferred embodiment, the amount of pH adjuster is less than 1% w/v. In general, it will be preferred to maintain the pH of the anodizing solution in this embodiment of the invention mildly acidic (e.g., a pH of from about 2.5 to about 5.5, preferably from about 3 to about 5).<br>
[0035.]	In certain embodiments of the invention, the anodizing solution is<br>
essentially (more preferably, entirely) free of chromium, permanganate, borate, sulfate, free fluoride and/or free chloride.<br>
[0036.]	Rapid coating formation is generally observed at average voltages of<br>
175 volts or less (preferably 100 or less), using pulsed DC. It is desirable that the average voltage be of sufficient magnitude to generate coatings of the invention at a rate of at least about 1 micron thickness per minute, preferably at least 3-8 microns in 3 minutes. If only for the sake of economy, it is desirable that the average voltage be less than, in increasing order of preference, 275, 250, 225, 200, 175,150, 140,130, 125, 120, 115, 110, 100 , 90 volts. Coatings of the invention are typically fine-grained and desirably are at least 1<br><br>
micron thick, preferred embodiments have coating thicknesses from 1-20 microns. Thinner<br>
or thicker coatings may be applied, although thinner coatings may not provide the desired<br>
coverage of the article. Without being bound by a single theory, it is believed that,<br>
particularly for insulating oxide films, as the coating thickness increases the film deposition<br>
rate is eventually reduced to a rate that approaches zero asymptotically. Add-on mass of<br>
coatings of the invention ranges from approximately 5-200 g/m2 or more and is a function<br>
of the coating thickness and the composition of the coating. It is desirable that the add-on<br>
mass of coatings be at least, in increasing order of preference, 5,10, 11, 12,14,16,18,<br>
20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50 g/m2.<br>
10037.]	A particularly preferred anodizing solution for use in forming a white<br>
protective coating on an aluminum or aluminum alloy substrate may be prepared using the<br>
following components:<br>
Zirconium Basic Carbonate   0.01 to 1 wt. %<br>
H2ZrF6	0.1 to 5wt.%<br>
Water	Balance to 100%<br>
pH adjusted to the range of 2 to 5 using ammonia, amine or other base.<br>
[0038.]	In a preferred embodiment utilizing zirconium basic carbonate and<br>
H2ZrF6, it is desirable 1hat the anodizing solution comprise zirconium basic carbonate in an<br>
amount of at least, in increasing order of preference 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30,<br>
0.35, 0.40, 0.45, 0.50, 0.55, 0.60 wt.% and not more than, in increasing order of preference<br>
1.0, 0.97, 0,95, 0.92, 0.90, 0.87, 0.85, 0.82, 0.80, 0.77 wt.%. In this embodiment, it is<br>
desirable that the anodizing solution comprises H2ZrF6 in an amount of at least, in<br>
increasing order of preference 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8. 1.0, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5,<br>
wt.% and not more than, in increasing order of preference 10, 9.75, 9.5, 9.25, 9.0, 8.75,<br>
8.5, 8.25, 8.0, 7.75 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0 wt.%.<br><br>
[0039.]	In a particularly preferred embodiment the amount of zirconium basic<br>
carbonate ranges from about 0.75 to 0.25 wt.%, the H2ZrF6 ranges from 6.0 to 9.5 wt%; a base such as ammonia is used to adjust the pH to ranges from 3 to 5.<br>
[0040.]	It is believed that the zirconium basic carbonate and the<br>
hexafluorozirconic acid combine to at least some extent to form one or more complex oxyfluoride species. The resulting anodizing solution permits.rapid anodization of articles using pulsed direct current having an average voltage of not more than 250 volts. In this particular embodiment of the invention, better coatings are generally obtained when the anodizing solution is maintained at a relatively high temperature during anodization (e.g., 40 degrees C to 80 degrees C). Alternatively, alternating current preferably having a voltage of from 300 to 600 volts may be used. The solution has the further advantage of forming protective coatings that are white in color, thereby eliminating the need to paint the anodized surface if a white decorative finish is desired. The anodized coatings produced in accordance with this embodiment of the invention typically have L values of at least 80, high hiding power at coating thicknesses of 4 to 8 microns, and excellent corrosion resistance. To the best of the inventor's knowledge, no anodization technologies being commercially practiced today are capable of producing coatings having this desirable combination of properties on aluminum or aluminum alloy coated ferrous metals and non-metals.<br>
[0041.]	Before being subjected to anodic treatment in accordance with the<br>
invention, the ferrous metal articles having a dissimilar metal coating preferably is subjected to a cleaning and/or degreasing step. For example, the article may be chemically degreased by exposure to an alkaline cleaner such as, for example, a diluted solution of PARCO Cleaner 305 (a product of the Henkel Surface Technologies division of Henkel Corporation, Madison Heights, Michigan). After cleaning, the article preferably is rinsed with water. Cleaning may then, if desired, be followed by deoxidizing using one of the many commercially available deoxidizing solutions known in the art run according to<br><br>
the manufacturer's specification. Suitable non-limiting examples of deoxidizing solutions include Deoxalume 2310 and SC 592 available from Henkel Corporation. Such pre-anodization treatments are well known in the art; typically, GalvalumeÂ® does not require deoxidizing.<br>
[0042.]	The protective coatings produced on the surface of the workpiece<br>
may, after anodization, be subjected to still further treatments such as painting, sealing and the like. For example, a dry-in-p)ace coating such as a silicone or a polyurethane waterborne dispersion may be applied to the anodized surface, typically at a film build (thickness) of from about 3 to about 30 microns.<br>
[0043.]	The invention will now be further described with reference to a<br>
number of specific examples, which are to be regarded solely as illustrative and not as restricting the scope of the invention.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
An anodizing solution was prepared using the following components:<br>
Parts peMOOOg<br>
Zirconium Basic Carbonate	5.5<br>
Fluorozirconic Acid (20% solution)    84.25<br>
Deionized Water	910.25<br>
The pH was adjusted to 3.5 using ammonia. Test panels of GalvalumeÂ® were<br>
subjected to anodization for 3 minutes in the anodizing solution using pulsed direct current<br>
having a peak ceiling voltage of 500 volts (approximate average voltage =130 volts). The<br>
wave shape of the current was nominally a square wave. The "on" time was 10<br>
milliseconds, the "off' time was 30 milliseconds (with the "off" or baseline voltage being 0%<br>
of the peak ceiling voltage). Coatings of 3-7 microns in thickness were formed on the<br><br>
surface of the GaivalumeÂ® test panels. The adherent, smooth coatings had a uniform white appearance.<br>
Example 2<br>
The test panels of Example 1 were analyzed using qualitative energy dispersive spectroscopy and found to comprise a coating comprised predominantly of zirconium and oxygen.<br>
A test panel was subjected to salt fog testing (ASTM B-117-03) for 1000 hours. A scribe, i.e. a linear scratch, was made through the anodized coating and down to the aluminum-zinc alloy coating prior to exposure to the salt fog environment. The test panel was exposed to 1000 hours of salt fog testing which resulted in no scribe or field corrosion. This is an improvement over known paint films of 25 microns or more which, when subjected to 1000 hours of salt fog show scribe corrosion.<br>
