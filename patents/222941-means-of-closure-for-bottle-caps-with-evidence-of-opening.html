				<td>MEANS OF CLOSURE FOR BOTTLE CAPS WITH EVIDENCE OF OPENING<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention refers to a means of closure for bottle caps with<br>
evidence of opening, that is to say, it is set as an objective that it should be<br>
made apparent after the cap is first opened that this opening has taken place.<br>
[0002] The present invention is characterised by its special configuration and<br>
design, thereby achieving a means of closure for bottle caps with a configuration<br>
such that, in the event of opening, this is made quite evident with no possibility<br>
at all of restoration, so that it represents a sure and effective seal.<br>
[0003] The present invention therefore lies in the field of closures for spirits<br>
bottles and more specifically of bottle cap closures which provide lasting<br>
evidence that the bottle has been opened.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] To date the commonest means of evidence of seal breakage are those<br>
described in the patent with publication number ES2126651, which consist of a<br>
perimeter band connected to the cap by means of easily broken bridges.<br>
[0005] This skirt is separated from the body of the cap once the bottle is opened<br>
for the first time because the body of the bottle has a retaining flange which acts<br>
in conjunction with a series of ribs provided on the inner side of the cap skirt to<br>
separate the skirt when first opened.<br>
[0006] Other bottle opening evidence systems are those described in the<br>
patent with publication number WO92/05085, which consists of using an inner<br>
sealing means and a cap.<br>
[00007] The inner sealing means is arranged directly on the mouth of the bottle.<br>
This sealing means has a flange that extends outwards and is folded back<br>
over the outer surface of the cap. The presence of this flange represents<br>
evidence that the bottle has not been opened.<br><br>
[0008] This means of evidence prevents unauthorized opening by providing<br>
means for indicating the opening of the bottle.<br>
[0009The patent with publication number WO97/38912 describes means of<br>
f evidence of opening for bottle cap closure also based on an element in the<br>
form of a perimeter skirt that extends from the lower rim of the cap, to which it<br>
is joined by means of lines of perforation.<br>
[0010] To achieve the separation of the cap from this skirt at the time of<br>
opening, on the inside the skirt has a series of hook-shaped protrusions,<br>
which are retained in some perimeter shoulders with which the bottle neck is<br>
provided.<br>
[0011] In any case, all the means of evidence of opening of bottle cap closures<br>
may be easily concealed.<br>
[0012] The object of the present invention is to secure means of evidence of<br>
opening based on a double action, on the one hand, the separation of the two<br>
parts of the outer aluminium capsule and, on the other, the release of a<br>
previously deformed evidential perimeter tongue.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] The bottle cap closure means with evidence of opening according to the<br>
present invention consists of making bottle opening quite apparent by means<br>
of a double action, the separation of the aluminium capsule into two parts and<br>
the release of a tongue, which adopts a position that prevents the possibility<br>
of obtaining a continuous new capsule again.<br>
[0014] The bottle closure that is. the object of this invention consists of a cap<br>
that is threaded on the inside against the outer thread on the pourer, which<br>
may be of the non-refill type.<br>
[0015] All round its underside this cap has a ring seal joined to the cap by<br>
means of perforations or breakable bridges, which break at the time of<br>
opening, producing a separation between the cap and the ring seal.<br>
[0016] This seal is provided with a tongue on its upper outer perimeter. Before<br>
fitting, the tongue is bent upwards slightly leaving a notch under it free.<br>
[0017] After the aluminium capsule is set in place, a notching operation is<br>
performed on the outside of the capsule matching up with the notch in the ring<br>
seal. This operation has a number of simultaneous effects:<br>
obtaining a perimeter cut in the capsule defining two lips, one on<br>
either side of the cut,<br>
these lips are bent towards the inside of the notch, the lower one<br>
holding the perimeter ring down and the other one holding the<br>
the perimeter tongue undergoes a certain degree of strain, which<br>
generates a stress, so that thereafter it exerts a pressure<br>
downwards, tending to close the notch, a circumstances that does<br>
not arise because this is prevented by the upper lip of the<br>
capsule.<br>
[0018] When opening takes place through turning the cap, the bridges linking<br>
the cap to the lower seal are broken and both parts separate.<br>
[0019] On the one hand and at the same time, the outer aluminium capsule is<br>
separated into the two parts defined by the perimeter cut over the notch, so<br>
that the upper lip corresponding to the capsule slides over the ring seal and<br>
releases it.<br>
[0020] The stress created by deformation of the tongue at the time of notching<br>
is released, so that the tongue regains a lower position, closing the cavity<br>
corresponding to the notch.<br>
[0021] The ring seal is integral with the bottle, being secured wholly or partly by<br>
the upper lip of the part below the cut in the aluminium capsule.<br>
[0022] The upper part of the aluminium capsule covers the cap with the lower<br>
lip bent inwards.<br>
[0023] As for the tongue, upon regaining its lower position closing the cavity<br>
corresponding to the notch, the upper perimeter tongue of the ring seal covers<br>
the inward bent lip of the lower section of the aluminium capsule, which<br>
secures the ring seal wholly or partly.<br>
[0024] In this way, the most visible part, including after closing the cap, is the<br>
tongue. When the tongue is of a different colour from that of the aluminium it is<br>
easily distinguished and reveals evidence of opening.<br>
[0025] In subsequent closing, the lower lip of what is now the upper portion of<br>
tthe aluminium capsule cannot now raise the tongue again and clasp it because it<br>
has already escaped from its grasp at the time of first opening and bent<br>
downwards. This circumstance reveals the irreveirsibility of the seal ring<br>
arrangement.<br>
[0026] Now, once closed, instead of seeing a notch, from the outside, we see a<br>
ring of a different colour, which indicates that the cap has already been opened.<br>
[0027] In order to assist the slight flexion that takes place in the seal tongue, a<br>
series of cuts is made in the tongue to improve its flexibility.<br>
[0028] On the other hand, in order to increase the strength of the aluminium<br>
capsule so that it may offer its lower edge bent at the notch point, the aluminium<br>
used is alloyed, thereby enhancing its strength.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
[0029] This descriptive report is supplemented with the accompanying drawings<br>
to illustrate the preferred specimen embodiment but never to limit the scope of<br>
the invention, in which drawings :<br>
[0030] Figure 1. shows a simplified sectional view of the evidential means<br>
situated in the closure assembly of a bottle before opening, according to an<br>
initial embodiment of the invention. A close view A is also included in which<br>
the area corresponding to the ring seal section is enlarged.<br>
[0031] Figure2 sbows the same figure as above after opening. A close view B<br>
is also included in which the area corresponding to the ring seal section is<br>
enlarged.<br>
[0032] Figure 3 shows a simplified sectional view of the evidential means<br>
situated in the closure assembly of a bottle before opening, according to a<br>
second embodiment of the invention. The capsule is not represented for the<br>
sake of clearer understanding.<br>
[0033] Figure 4 shows a simplified view of the evidential means of a bottle that<br>
has been opened.<br>
SPECIMEN EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0034] In the light of the foregoing figures two specimen embodiments of the<br>
invention are described below, together with an explanation of the drawings.<br>
First specimen embodiment<br>
[0035] Figure 1 shows a cap (1) linked by its underside to a ring seal (2) by<br>
means of breakable bridges (4). These bridges (4) are the ones that will break<br>
at the time when the cap is first turned.<br>
[0036] The turning of the cap (1) gives rise to a helical movement, i.e. turn is<br>
combined with an axial movement.<br>
[0037] If the ring seal (2) is locked, as is the case of this first specimen, the turn<br>
generates a shear stress on the breakable bridges (4).<br>
[0038] The axial movement in turn applies a traction stress on the same<br>
breakable bridges (4) due to the strain exerted by the separation between the<br>
cap (1) and the ring (2).<br>
[0039] The result of the helical turn of the cap (1) is a tensional stress that is<br>
the result of two stresses; a tensional and a shear stress, giving rise to<br>
breakage after surpassing the permissible stress of the material.<br>
[0040] To lock the ring seal (2), this seal (2) is integral with the body (3) of the<br>
pourer and therefore prevented from relative turn. The means preventing<br>
relative turn consist of outer teeth (3.1) presented by the pourer body (3),<br>
applied against the ring seal (2).<br>
[0041] The number and size of the breakable bridges (4) will depend on the<br>
breaking strength that we wish the assembly to offer.<br>
[0042] At the top, the ring seal (2) has a salient or tongue that arises all the way<br>
round (2.1) forming a cavity (2.1.1) immediately below it.<br>
[0043] Enclosing the whole assembly there is an aluminium cover or capsule<br>
(5) which has a perimeter notch (6) after application of a cut such that it<br>
ensures that the lips of the cut are engaged in the cavity (2.1.1) through being<br>
curved inwards.<br>
[0044] The perimeter cut which gives rise to the notch (6) in the aluminium<br>
capsule (5) is made during assembly. After setting the aluminium capsule (5)<br>
in place on the cap (1), a machine exerts pressure all the way round until<br>
cutting a groove in the capsule (5), which is when the tongue (2.1) undergoes<br>
a slight upward flexion.<br>
[0045] Optionally, a series of perimeter cuts are made to enhance its flexibility.<br>
[0046] Figure 2 shows how the assembly appears after the First time the bottle<br>
is opened. After this initial opening of the bottle, the aluminium capsule (5) is<br>
separated into two parts: an upper (5.2) and a lower (5.1) portion, both with<br>
the lips of the cut tucked in.<br>
[0047] In the upper part (5.2) of the aluminium capsule (5) after separation, its<br>
i tucked-in lip (5.3) ceases to retain the tongue (2.1), so that it recovers the<br>
natural position to which it tends, i.e. downwards.<br>
[0048] Furthermore, thanks to the notching (6) in the aluminium capsule (5), the<br>
lower lip (5.3) of the upper half (5.2) of the aluminium capsule (5) retains the<br>
shape given, covering the lower rim of the cap (1).<br>
[0049] As regards the lip (5.4) of the lower half (5.1) of the aluminium capsule<br>
(5), it also retains the shape given in the notching (6), so that this lip (5.4) is<br>
engaged in the cavity (2.1.1) and partly covered under the tongue (2.1 j of the<br>
ring seal (2).<br>
[0050] On account of this configuration after opening, the tongue (2.1) is visible<br>
even when cap is closed again, in which case a ring of the same colour as the<br>
tongue (2.1) is visible, and it is not possible to conceal or restore the situation<br>
prior to opening by bending the tongue (2.1) and the lips (5.3, 5.4) of the parts<br>
into which the aluminium capsule (5) is divided.<br>
[0051] Figure 4 shows how the tongue (2.1) is visible and the ring seal (2)<br>
joined to the lower portion (5.1) of aluminium capsule (5) by way of its upper<br>
lip (5.4), a fastening that is supplemented with the teeth (3.1) of the pourer<br>
cap (3) which prevent the ring seal (2) from turning.<br>
[0052] This same figure shows the outer fluting (1.1) with which the cap (1) is<br>
provided, as the upper section of the aluminium capsule (5.2) has been partly<br>
removed in this representation in order to show this fluting (1.1) which helps<br>
the cap (1) to grip the capsule (5) and prevents them from turning in relation<br>
to each other.<br>
Second specimen embodiment<br>
[0053] Figure 3 shows a second specimen embodiment of the invention, which<br>
slightly modifies the configuration of the ring seal (2) to establish another way<br>
of shearing the breakable bridges. (4).<br>
[0054] In this second specimen embodiment of the invention the pourer body<br>
6 (3) does not include outer teeth (3.1) to impede relative turn between the body<br>
(3) and the ring seal (2).<br>
[0055] It is, however, provided with a perimeter shoulder (3.2) with a<br>
pronounced step below it, preferably sharp-edged, situated below the screw<br>
5 threads (3.3).<br>
[0056] The ring seal (2) also has another internal perimeter shoulder (2.2)<br>
which rests under the perimeter shoulder (3.2) of the pourer body (3).<br>
[0057] The mechanical tie between the ring seal (2) and the pourer body (3) is<br>
only axial as the ring seal (2) is no longer prevented from turning.<br>
[0059] the result of this arrangement is that at the time of first opening the turn<br>
'of the cap (1) continues to be helical, i.e. a turn plus an axial movement; and<br>
the ring (2) presents the same turn as the cap (1) as this does not have the<br>
extent of its freedom of movement impeded.<br>
[0059] Therefore, the relative movement between the cap (1) and its ring seal<br>
(2) is that of a distancing in the axial direction.<br>
[0060] The axial distancing between both bodies causes the stress in the<br>
breakable bridges (4) to be mainly due to tensile stress, while shear stress is<br>
reduced to the minimum required to overcome the ring seal (2) friction forces.<br>
[0061] As a result, the ring seal (2) remains secured axially by two means, one<br>
by the pair of internal shoulders (3.2, 2.2) operating together and the grip<br>
offered by the lip (5.4), not shown in this third figure for the sake of clarity.<br>
[0062] In this way, the influence that the degree of upper lip (5.4) strain exerts,<br>
previously the only means responsible for securing the ring seal (2), is made<br>
independent of the adjustment of the machinery that performs the notching<br>
(6) to provide a good grip on the tongue (2.1); and, in turn, the ring seal (2)<br>
retaining means are the ones that reduce the probability of failure due to<br>
inadequate fastening.<br>
[0063] The other items in the specimen embodiment are not described as they<br>
are the same as those described in the first embodiment.<br>
[0004] Changes in the materials, shape, size and arrangement of the<br>
component items, described in a non-restrictive way, do not alter the<br>
essentials of this invention and this description is sufficient for an expert to be<br>
able to proceed to its reproduction.<br>
