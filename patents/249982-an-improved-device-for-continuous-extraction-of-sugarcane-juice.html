				<td>The present invention relates to an improved device for continuous and hygienic extraction of sugarcane juice.<br>
The machine of the present invention is particularly useful for continuously and hygienically extracting juice from cleaned sugarcane of any length and diameter. Cleaned sugarcane is passed through set of rollers with special profile on the surface and guides for maximum juice extraction under suitable enclosure to ensure hygiene of the juice collected. Device is enclosed with suitable covers to avoid fly or dust interference with juice extraction and single pass extraction avoids even human interference which results in a hygienically extracted fresh sugarcane juice untouched by hands. With the ever increasing demand for soft beverages and fruit based beverages, both carbonated and still, are available in the market. India offers itself a potential market for these products. All the sugarcanes produced in the country is not lifted by the sugar mills, leaving almost one third for use in the production of gur and khandsari.<br>
This necessitates finding ways and means of using sugarcane for other purposes. In this context, Central Food Technological Research Institute has made significant contributions in the field of sugarcane juice by undertaking frontline R&amp;D work. CFTRI has developed processes for the preservation of sugarcane juice beverage in bottle, standi pouches, aluminium cans and also as powders. The beverage, being natural possesses a lot of medicinal and curative properties in the treatment of several ailments. The beverage is calorific and nutritive. Currently, fresh sugarcane juice extraction for domestic consumption is through multiple pass of sugarcane in between two rollers open to atmosphere. Consequently, juice is unhygienic due to fly, dust, and human interferences.<br>
As on today there are no machines to get sugarcane juice hygienically extracted with out the interference of fly, dust, and human for domestic consumption of sugarcane juice as beverage. By avoiding external interferences and external impurities, juice quality is superior. Also the extraction efficiency is at par with the multitendum mills, and multi pass, hence competitive and cost effective. The bagasse is automatically collected inside a closed chamber for hygienic surroundings.<br><br>
Hence, an improved sugarcane crushing machine has a wide application, for fresh juice preparation to improve the quality of juice, for the preservation of the juice to avoid any deterioration in quality during storage and for the preparation of improved quality jaggery at the rural level. These facts will have far reaching benefits in terms of hygiene, better product quality and better premium for diversified products. Also, it will have a greater impact in the urban area to meet demand for hygienic sugarcane juice for domestic consumption.<br>
The machine of the present invention is therefore useful as a device for extracting the juice with improved quality for different applications as described above, untouched by hand. As an important device, different varieties and sizes of sugarcanes can be extracted. Many a times the operators are in the risk of cutting their fingers as well, due to open two roll extractors. In the present invention, the machine is completely enclosed with SS covers, with opening only for feeding the canes. The pressing gap between rollers is kept as low as possible and in decreasing order to extract maximum juice in multiple stages, without wastage. The device would result in reduction in accident, labor and drudgery on the part of laborers, help in hygienic operations, and enhance uniformity in quality and quantities.<br>
Hitherto the process of extraction is highly unhygienic and after extraction the baggase is kept in open and flies feed on this making the environment more un-hygienic.<br>
Reference may be made to the conventional two roll extracting machines being used by roadside juice extracting centers (street hawkers). Both manual and motorized units are available. The drawback of this system is that, the canes are squeezed between two rollers and are fed manually with multiple passes, which is highly unhygienic. No facility to collect the bagasse after extraction and is strewn all over causing unhealthy environment with bad smell and flies.<br><br>
Reference may be made to an Indian patent (No. 186646) by Bhausaheb Bapurao Nikkam, Maharastra, wherein an improved two roll sugarcane crushing mill comprising of a plurality of improved two roll mill modules in tandem, with a pair of main crushing rolls mounted on a rigid frame, a feeder roller and juice drainage means. The drawback of this system is that, the canes are squeezed between two rollers and are fed manually, which is highly unhygienic. No facility to collect the bagasse after extraction and is strewn all over causing unhealthy environment with bad smell and flies.<br>
Reference may be made to Sugarcane juice machine (Catalogue, Neethi Trading Corporation, Vellore-632001, Tamil Nadu) wherein sugarcane presser is being marketed having only one set of rollers for pressing juice. The draw back of this system is that the both sides of sugarcane must be cut open in order to avoid overload when the diameter of the canes are upto 30 mm, also since it has only one set of rollers the yields may not be satisfactory.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved device for continuous extraction of sugarcane juice.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide hygienic conditions through mechanized operation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Yet another object is to increase productivity, without any multiple passes of the canes.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device capable of working with a wide range of sizes of canes.<br>
Still another object is to provide a closed chamber to collect the bagaasse and a small chamber for collecting the juice.<br><br>
The device of the present invention overcomes most of the drawbacks of the existing method of sugarcane juice extraction.<br>
