				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The disclosure relates generally to input/output processing, and in particular, to providing a<br>
non-contiguous indirect data addressing list at an I/O subsystem of an I/O processing system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF BACKGROUND<br>
Input/output (I/O) operations are used to transfer data between memory and I/O devices of<br>
an I/O processing system. Specifically, data is written from memory to one or more I/O<br>
devices, and data is read from one or more I/O devices to memory by executing I/O<br>
operations.<br>
To facilitate processing of I/O operations, an I/O subsystem of the I/O processing system is<br>
employed. The I/O subsystem is coupled to main memory and the I/O devices of the I/O<br>
processing system and directs the flow of information between memory and the I/O devices.<br>
One example of an I/O subsystem is a channel subsystem. The channel subsystem uses<br>
channel paths as communications media. Each channel path includes a channel coupled to a<br>
control unit, the control unit being further coupled to one or more I/O devices.<br>
The channel subsystem may employ channel command words (CCWs) to transfer data<br>
between the I/O devices and memory. A CCW specifies the command to be executed. For<br>
commands initiating certain I/O operations, the CCW designates the memory area associated<br>
with the operation, the action to be taken whenever a transfer to or from the area is<br>
completed, and other options.<br>
During I/O processing, a list of CCWs is fetched from memory by a channel. The channel<br>
parses each command from the list of CCWs and forwards a number of the commands, each<br>
command in its own entity, to a control unit coupled to the channel. The control unit then<br>
processes the commands. The channel tracks the state of each command and controls when<br>
the next set of commands are to be sent to the control unit for processing. The channel<br>
ensures that each command is sent to the control unit in its own entity. Further, the channel<br>
infers certain information associated with processing the response from the control unit for<br>
each command.<br>
3<br>
Performing I/O processing on a per CCW basis may involve a large amount of processing<br>
overhead for the channel subsystem, as the channels parse CCWs, track state information,<br>
and react to responses from the control units. Therefore, it may be beneficial to shift much<br>
of the processing burden associated with interpreting and managing CCW and state<br>
information from the channel subsystem to the control units. Simplifying the role of<br>
channels in communicating between the control units and an operating system in the I/O<br>
processing system may increase communication throughput as less handshaking is<br>
performed. However, altering command sequences, as well as roles of the channel<br>
subsystem and the control units, allows the amount of data that is transferred within a single<br>
I/O operation to more than one megabyte. This is the maximum amount of data that can be<br>
transferred with one continuous list of transport indirect data addresses when the system<br>
page size is 4k bytes. Currently, an existing Channel Command Word (CCW) cannot<br>
support a data transfer of more than 64k bytes within a single I/O operation because of the<br>
limitation of the two byte count field in the CCW. The Transport Control Word (TCW)<br>
solved that problem by increasing the byte count to four bytes in the TCW, but then the next<br>
limitation of one megabyte was encountered because the transport indirect data address list<br>
(TIDAL) must be contained in one page which is 4k bytes which only allowed 256 address<br>
list entries.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Embodiments of the invention include a computer program product for providing indirect<br>
data addressing at an input/output (I/O) subsystem of an I/O processing system. The<br>
computer program product includes a tangible storage medium readable by a processing<br>
circuit and storing instructions for execution by the processing circuit for performing a<br>
method. The method includes receiving a control word for an I/O operation. The control<br>
5<br>
word includes an indirect data address for data associated with the I/O operation. The<br>
indirect data address includes a starting location of a list of storage addresses that<br>
collectively specify the data, the list spans two or more non-contiguous storage locations.<br>
Data is gathered responsive to the list. The gathered data is transmitted to a control unit in<br>
the I/O processing system.<br>
Additional embodiments include an apparatus for providing indirect data addressing at an<br>
I/O subsystem of an I/O processing system. The apparatus includes an I/O subsystem<br>
adapted to communicate with a control unit in the I/O processing system. The I/O<br>
subsystem performs a method including receiving a control word for an I/O operation. The<br>
control word includes an indirect data address for data associated with the I/O operation.<br>
The indirect data address includes a starting location of a list of storage addresses that<br>
collectively specify the data, the list spans two or more non-contiguous storage locations.<br>
Data is gathered responsive to the list. The gathered data is transmitted to the control unit.<br>
Further embodiments include a method for providing indirect data addressing at an I/O<br>
subsystem of an I/O processing system. The method includes receiving a control word for<br>
an I/O operation. The control word includes an indirect data address for data associated with<br>
the I/O operation. The indirect data address includes a starting location of a list of storage<br>
addresses that collectively specify the data, the list spans two or more non-contiguous<br>
storage locations. Data is gathered responsive to the list. The gathered data is transmitted to<br>
a control unit in the I/O processing system.<br>
Still further embodiments include a computer program product for providing indirect data<br>
addressing at an I/O subsystem of an I/O processing system. The computer program product<br>
includes a tangible storage medium readable by a processing circuit and storing instructions<br>
for execution by the processing circuit for performing a method. The method includes<br>
receiving a control word for an I/O operation. The control word includes an indirect data<br>
address for customer data output from the I/O operation. The indirect data address includes<br>
a starting location of a list of storage addresses that collectively specify a storage location for<br>
the customer data output, the list spans two or more non-contiguous storage locations.<br>
Customer data output is received from a control unit in the I/O processing system in<br>
response to the I/O operation being executed at the control unit. The customer data output is<br>
stored at the storage location at the I/O subsystem responsive to the list.<br>
6<br>
Other articles of manufacture, apparatuses, and/or methods according to embodiments will<br>
be or become apparent to one with skill in the art upon review of the following drawings and<br>
detailed description. It is intended that all such additional articles of manufacture,<br>
apparatuses, and/or methods be included within this description, be within the scope of the<br>
invention, and be protected by the accompanying claims.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the invention, input/output (I/O) processing is facilitated.<br>
I/O processing is facilitated, in one example, by reducing communications between<br>
components of an I/O processing system used to perform the I/O processing. For instance,<br>
the number of exchanges and sequences between an I/O communications adapter, such as a<br>
channel, and a control unit is reduced. This is accomplished by sending a plurality of<br>
commands from the I/O communications adapter to the control unit as a single entity for<br>
execution by the control unit, and by the control unit sending the data resulting from the<br>
commands, if any, as a single entity.<br>
The plurality of commands are included in a block, referred to herein as a transport<br>
command control block (TCCB), an address of which is specified in a transport control word<br>
(TCW). The TCW is sent from an operating system (OS) or other application to the I/O<br>
communications adapter, which in turn forwards the TCCB in a command message to the<br>
control unit for processing. The control unit processes each of the commands absent a<br>
tracking of status relative to those individual commands by the I/O communications adapter.<br>
The plurality of commands is also referred to as a channel program, which is parsed and<br>
executed on the control unit rather than the I/O communications adapter.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the TCW for an I/O operation includes pointers indicating the<br>
location of the control data (e.g., the TCCB) and the customer data associated with the I/O<br>
operation. In an exemplary embodiment, the pointers refer to an indirect data address,<br>
referred to herein as a transport mode indirect data address list (TIDAL). The TIDAL<br>
includes a list of addresses where the data is located; these addresses are referred to herein as<br>
transport mode indirect data address words (TIDAWs). In the current system design with<br>
4K pages the TIDAL cannot be larger than four kilobytes (4K), thus limiting the number of<br>
continuous TIDAWs that may be included in a single TIDAL to 256 (each TIDAL is 16<br>
bytes). This limits the total amount of data that can be transferred by one I/O operation to<br>
one megabyte assuming 4K pages, each TIDAL is 16 bytes and the TIDAL has to be<br>
7<br>
contained in one 4K page. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, this limitation is<br>
removed by allowing a TIDAW address to indicate the starting location of the next<br>
TIDAWs at another storage location which may be in a different page. A flag in the<br>
TIDAW is utilized to indicate whether the address of the TIDAW includes a data address or<br>
an address of the continuation of the TIDAW list. In this manner, TIDAWs making up a<br>
single TIDAL can be located in non-contiguous storage locations and thus, more than 256<br>
TIDAWs can be included in a single TIDAL list. This allows more data to be transferred<br>
within a single I/O operation. For example, in an exemplary embodiment, where the count<br>
field in the TCW is four bytes, about four gigabytes (four gigabytes minus one byte) may be<br>
transferred within a single I/O operation.<br>
One example of an I/O processing system incorporating and using one or more aspects of the<br>
invention is described with reference to FIG. 1. I/O processing system 100 includes a host<br>
system 101, which further includes for instance, a main memory 102, one or more central<br>
processing units (CPUs) 104, a storage control element 106, and a channel subsystem 108.<br>
The host system 101 may be a large scale computing system, such as a mainframe or server.<br>
The I/O processing system 100 also includes one or more control units 110 and one or more<br>
I/O devices 112, each of which is described below.<br>
Main memory 102 stores data and programs, which can be input from I/O devices 112. For<br>
example, the main memory 102 may include one or more operating systems (OSs) 103 that<br>
are executed by one or more of the CPUs 104. For example, one CPU 104 can execute a<br>
Linux® operating system 103 and a z/OS® operating system 103 as different virtual<br>
machine instances. The main memory 102 is directly addressable and provides for highspeed<br>
processing of data by the CPUs 104 and the channel subsystem 108.<br>
CPU 104 is the controlling center of the I/O processing system 100. It contains sequencing<br>
and processing facilities for instruction execution, interruption action, timing functions,<br>
initial program loading, and other machine-related functions. CPU 104 is coupled to the<br>
storage control element 106 via a connection 114, such as a bidirectional or unidirectional<br>
bus.<br>
Storage control element 106 is coupled to the main memory 102 via a connection 116, such<br>
as a bus; to CPUs 104 via connection 114; and to channel subsystem 108 via a connection<br>
8<br>
118. Storage control element 106 controls, for example, queuing and execution of requests<br>
made by CPU 104 and channel subsystem 108.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, channel subsystem 108 provides a communication interface<br>
between host system 101 and control units 110. Channel subsystem 108 is coupled to<br>
storage control element 106, as described above, and to each of the control units 110 via a<br>
connection 120, such as a serial link. Connection 120 may be implemented as an optical<br>
link, employing single-mode or multi-mode waveguides in a Fibre Channel fabric. Channel<br>
subsystem 108 directs the flow of information between I/O devices 112 and main memory<br>
102. It relieves the CPUs 104 of the task of communicating directly with the I/O devices<br>
112 and permits data processing to proceed concurrently with I/O processing. The channel<br>
subsystem 108 uses one or more channel paths 122 as the communication links in managing<br>
the flow of information to or from I/O devices 112. As a part of the I/O processing, channel<br>
subsystem 108 also performs the path-management functions of testing for channel path<br>
availability, selecting an available channel path 122 and initiating execution of the operation<br>
with the I/O devices 112.<br>
Each channel path 122 includes a channel 124 (channels 124 are located within the channel<br>
subsystem 108, in one example, as shown in FIG. 1), one or more control units 110 and one<br>
or more connections 120. In another example, it is also possible to have one or more<br>
dynamic switches (not depicted) as part of the channel path 122. A dynamic switch is<br>
coupled to a channel 124 and a control unit 110 and provides the capability of physically<br>
interconnecting any two links that are attached to the switch. In another example, it is also<br>
possible to have multiple systems, and therefore multiple channel subsystems (not depicted)<br>
attached to control unit 110.<br>
Also located within channel subsystem 108 are subchannels (not shown). One subchannel is<br>
provided for and dedicated to each I/O device 112 accessible to a program through the<br>
channel subsystem 108. A subchannel (e.g., a data structure, such as a table) provides the<br>
logical appearance of a device to the program. Each subchannel provides information<br>
concerning the associated I/O device 112 and its attachment to channel subsystem 108. The<br>
subchannel also provides information concerning I/O operations and other functions<br>
involving the associated I/O device 112. The subchannel is the means by which channel<br>
9<br>
subsystem 108 provides information about associated I/O devices 112 to CPUs 104, which<br>
obtain this information by executing I/O instructions.<br>
Channel subsystem 108 is coupled to one or more control units 110. Each control unit 110<br>
provides logic to operate and control one or more I/O devices 112 and adapts, through the<br>
use of common facilities, the characteristics of each I/O device 112 to the link interface<br>
provided by the channel 124. The common facilities provide for the execution of I/O<br>
operations, indications concerning the status of the I/O device 112 and control unit 110,<br>
control of the timing of data transfers over the channel path 122 and certain levels of I/O<br>
device 112 control.<br>
Each control unit 110 is attached via a connection 126 (e.g., a bus) to one or more I/O<br>
devices 112. I/O devices 112 receive information or store information in main memory 102<br>
and/or other memory. Examples of I/O devices 112 include card readers and punches,<br>
magnetic tape units, direct access storage devices, displays, keyboards, printers, pointing<br>
devices, teleprocessing devices, communication controllers and sensor based equipment, to<br>
name a few.<br>
One or more of the above components of the I/O processing system 100 are further described<br>
in “IBM® z/Architecture Principles of Operation,” Publication No. SA22-7832-05, 6th<br>
Edition, April 2007; U.S. Patent No. 5,461,721 entitled “System For Transferring Data<br>
Between I/O Devices And Main Or Expanded Storage Under Dynamic Control Of<br>
Independent Indirect Address Words (IDAWS),” Cormier et al., issued October 24, 1995;<br>
and U.S. Patent No. 5,526,484 entitled “Method And System For Pipelining The Processing<br>
Of Channel Command Words,” Casper et al., issued June 11, 1996, each of which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. IBM is a registered trademark of<br>
International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, New York, USA. Other names used<br>
herein may be registered trademarks, trademarks or product names of International Business<br>
Machines Corporation or other companies.<br>
In one embodiment, to transfer data between I/O devices 112 and memory 102, channel<br>
command words (CCWs) are used. A CCW specifies the command to be executed, and<br>
includes other fields to control processing. One example of a CCW is described with<br>
reference to FIG. 2A. A CCW 200 includes, for instance, a command code 202 specifying<br>
10<br>
the command to be executed (e.g., read, read backward, control, sense and write); a plurality<br>
of flags 204 used to control the I/O operation; for commands that specify the transfer of data,<br>
a count field 206 that specifies the number of bytes in the storage area designated by the<br>
CCW to be transferred; and a data address 208 that points to a location in main memory that<br>
includes data, when direct addressing is employed, or to a list (e.g., contiguous list) of<br>
modified indirect data address words (MIDAWs) to be processed, when modified indirect<br>
data addressing is employed. Modified indirect addressing is further described in U.S.<br>
Application Serial Number 11/464,613, entitled “Flexibly Controlling The Transfer Of Data<br>
Between Input/Output Devices And Memory,” Brice et al., filed August 15, 2006, which is<br>
hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
One or more CCWs arranged for sequential execution form a channel program, also referred<br>
to herein as a CCW channel program. The CCW channel program is set up by, for instance,<br>
an operating system, or other software. The software sets up the CCWs and obtains the<br>
addresses of memory assigned to the channel program. An example of a CCW channel<br>
program is described with reference to FIG. 2B. A CCW channel program 210 includes, for<br>
instance, a define extent CCW 212 that has a pointer 214 to a location in memory of define<br>
extent data 216 to be used with the define extent command. In this example, a transfer in<br>
channel (TIC) 218 follows the define extent command that refers the channel program to<br>
another area in memory (e.g., an application area) that includes one or more other CCWs,<br>
such as a locate record 217 that has a pointer 219 to locate record data 220, and one or more<br>
write CCWs 221. Each write CCW 220 has a pointer 222 to a data area 224. The data area<br>
includes an address to directly access the data or a list of data address words (e.g., MIDAWs<br>
or IDAWs) to indirectly access the data. Further, CCW channel program 210 includes a<br>
predetermined area in the channel subsystem defined by the device address called the<br>
subchannel for status 226 resulting from execution of the CCW channel program.<br>
The processing of a CCW channel program is described with reference to FIG. 3, as well as<br>
with reference to FIG. 2B. In particular, FIG. 3 shows an example of the various exchanges<br>
and sequences that occur between a channel and a control unit when a CCW channel<br>
program is executing. The link protocol used for the communications is FICON (Fibre<br>
Connectivity), in this example. Information regarding FICON is described in “Fibre<br>
Channel Single Byte Command Code Sets-3 Mapping Protocol (FC-SB-3), T11/Project<br>
11<br>
1357-D/Rev. 1.6, INCITS (March 2003), which is hereby incorporated herein by reference<br>
in its entirety.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a channel 300 opens an exchange with a control unit 302 and sends a<br>
define extent command and data associated therewith 304 to control unit 302. The command<br>
is fetched from define extent CCW 212 (FIG. 2B) and the data is obtained from define extent<br>
data area 216. The channel 300 uses TIC 218 to locate the locate record CCW and the write<br>
CCW. It fetches the locate record command and data 306 (FIG. 3) from the locate record<br>
CCW 217 (FIG. 2B) and locate record data 220. The write command and data 308 (FIG. 3)<br>
is fetched from write CCW 221 and data area 224 (FIG. 2B). Each is sent to the control unit<br>
302.<br>
The control unit 302 opens an exchange 310 with the channel 300, in response to the open<br>
exchange of the channel 300. This can occur before or after locate command and data 306<br>
and/or write command and data 308. Along with the open exchange, a response (CMR) is<br>
forwarded to the channel 300. The CMR provides an indication to the channel 300 that the<br>
control unit 302 is active and operating.<br>
The control unit 302 provides the status to the channel 300 and closes the exchange 312. In<br>
response thereto, the channel 300 stores the data, examines the status and closes the<br>
exchange 314, which indicates to the control unit 302 that the status has been received.<br>
The processing of the above CCW channel program to write 4k of data requires two<br>
exchanges to be opened and closed and six sequences. The total number of exchanges and<br>
sequences between the channel and control unit is reduced through collapsing multiple<br>
commands of the channel program into a TCCB. The channel, e.g., channel 124 of FIG. 1,<br>
uses a TCW to identify the location of the TCCB, as well as locations for accessing and<br>
storing status and data associated with executing the channel program. The TCW is<br>
interpreted by the channel and is not sent or seen by the control unit.<br>
One example of a channel program to write 4k of data, as in FIG. 2B, but includes a TCCB,<br>
instead of separate individual CCWs, is described with reference to FIG. 4. As shown, a<br>
channel program 400, referred to herein as a TCW channel program, includes a TCW 402<br>
specifying a location in memory of a TCCB 404, as well as a location in memory of a data<br>
area 406 or a TIDAL 410 (i.e., a list of transport mode indirect data address words<br>
12<br>
(TIDAWs), similar to MIDAWs) that points to data area 406, and a status area 408. TIDAW<br>
zero 412, TIDAW one 414 and TIDAW two 416 (collectively TIDAWs 412 – 416) can<br>
reference different locations in the data area 406 for acquiring or storing data. The TIDAWs<br>
412 – 416 can reference non-contiguous blocks of data or contiguous blocks of data. The<br>
TIDAWs 412 – 416 in TIDAL 410 may be located sequentially in memory or located noncontiguously<br>
relative to each other. While only three TIDAWs 412 – 416 are depicted in<br>
TIDAL 410, it will be understood that any number of TIDAWs can be included in the<br>
TIDAL 410.<br>
The processing of a TCW channel program is described with reference to FIG. 5. The link<br>
protocol used for these communications is, for instance, Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). In<br>
particular, three phases of the FCP link protocol are used, allowing host bus adapters to be<br>
used that support FCP to perform data transfers controlled by CCWs. FCP and its phases are<br>
described further in “Information Technology – Fibre Channel Protocol for SCSI, Third<br>
Version (FCP-3),” T10 Project 1560-D, Revision 4, September 13, 2005, which is hereby<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a channel 500 opens an exchange with a control unit 502 and sends<br>
TCCB 504 to the control unit 502. In one example, the TCCB 504 and sequence initiative<br>
are transferred to the control unit 502 in a FCP command, referred to as FCP_CMND<br>
information unit (IU) or a transport command IU. The control unit 502 transmits a transfer<br>
ready (XFER_RDY) IU 510 to the channel 500 when it is ready to receive data for the write<br>
commands received in the TCCB 504. In response to receiving the XFER_RDY IU 510, the<br>
channel 500 transfers the data 506 to the control unit 502, via, for instance, a FCP_Data IU.<br>
The control unit 502 executes the multiple commands of the TCCB 504 (e.g., define extent<br>
command, locate record command, write command as device control words (DCWs)) and<br>
writes the data 506 received from the channel 500. It also provides status and closes the<br>
exchange 508. As one example, final status is sent in a FCP status frame that has a bit active<br>
in, for instance, byte 10 or 11 of the payload of a FCP_RSP IU, also referred to as a transport<br>
response IU. The FCP_RSP IU payload may be used to transport FICON ending status<br>
along with additional status information.<br>
The embodiment of the link protocol depicted in FIG. 5 is utilized when XFER_RDY is<br>
enabled. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 5, the channel 500 cannot send the data 506 to<br>
13<br>
the control unit 502 until it is requested by the control unit 502 via the XFER_RDY IU 510.<br>
In an alternate exemplary embodiment, XFER_RDY is disabled and the control unit does not<br>
transmit a XFER_RDY IU 510 to the channel 500. Thus, the channel 500 does not have to<br>
wait for the control unit 502 to request the data 506 before sending the data 506. This<br>
alternate embodiment, where XFER_RDY is disabled may be utilized when the channel 500<br>
and the control unit 502 are located geographically far apart from each other (e.g., greater<br>
than twenty kilometers, greater than fifty kilometers) to improve performance. Unless<br>
otherwise specified, the discussion herein assumes that XFER_RDY is enabled.<br>
In a further example, to write 4K of customer data, the channel 500 uses the FCP link<br>
protocol phases, as follows:<br>
1. Transfer a TCCB in the FCP_CMND IU and sequence initiative to the control<br>
unit 502.<br>
2. Wait for a XFER_RDY IU indicating that the control unit is ready to receive the<br>
data.<br>
3. Transfer the IU of data, and sequence initiative to the control unit 502.<br>
4. Final status is sent in a FCP status frame that has a bit active in, for instance, byte<br>
10 or 11 of the FCP_RSP IU Payload. The FCP_RSP_INFO field or sense field is used to<br>
transport FICON ending status along with additional status information.<br>
By executing the TCW channel program of FIG. 4, there is only one exchange opened and<br>
closed (see also FIG. 5), instead of two exchanges for the CCW channel program of FIG. 2B<br>
(see also FIG. 3). Further, for the TCW channel program, there are four communication<br>
sequences (see FIGs. 4-5), as compared to six sequences for the CCW channel program (see<br>
FIGs. 2B-3).<br>
The number of exchanges and sequences remain the same for a TCW channel program, even<br>
if additional commands are added to the program. Compare, for example, the<br>
communications of the CCW channel program of FIG. 6 with the communications of the<br>
TCW channel program of FIG. 7. In the CCW channel program of FIG. 6, each of the<br>
commands (e.g., define extent command and data 600, locate record command and data 601,<br>
14<br>
write command and data 602, write command and data 604, locate record command and data<br>
606, write command and data 608, and write command and data 620) are sent in separate<br>
sequences from channel 610 to control unit 612. This CCW channel program requires two<br>
exchanges to be opened and closed (e.g., open exchanges 622, 624 and close exchanges 626,<br>
628), and ten communications sequences. This is compared to the four sequences and one<br>
exchange for the TCW channel program of FIG. 7, which accomplishes the same task as the<br>
CCW channel program of FIG. 6.<br>
As depicted in FIG. 7, a channel 700 opens an exchange with a control unit 702 and sends a<br>
TCCB 704 to the control unit 702. The TCCB 704 includes the define extent command, the<br>
two locate record commands, and the four write commands in DCWs, as described above.<br>
Similar to the example depicted in FIG. 5, the control unit 702 may use an XFER_RDY IU<br>
710 to notify the channel 700 that it is ready receive data, provided that XFER_RDY support<br>
is not disabled. The channel 700 transmits 16k of data 706 to the control unit 702 in a single<br>
sequence upon receipt of the XFER_RDY IU 710. The channel 700 inserts a CRC every 4K<br>
of the 16k of data 706 in the sequence. The insertion of a CRC every 4K allows the control<br>
unit 702 to verify the 16K of data incrementally, rather than buffer the entire 16K for<br>
verification before completing the write commands in the TCCB 704. Additionally, the<br>
control unit 702 provides status to the channel 700 and closes the exchange 708. Thus, the<br>
TCW channel program of FIG. 7 requires much less communications to transfer the same<br>
amount of data as the CCW channel program of FIG. 6, while supporting incremental data<br>
verification via multiple CRC insertion in the output data stream from the channel 700.<br>
Turning now to FIG. 8, one embodiment of channel 124 in the channel subsystem 108 and<br>
the control unit 110 of FIG. 1 that support TCW channel program execution are depicted in<br>
greater detail. The control unit 110 includes CU control logic 802 to parse and process<br>
messages containing a TCCB, such as the TCCB 704 of FIG. 7, as well as data received<br>
from the channel 124 via the connection 120. The CU control logic 802 can extract DCWs<br>
and control data from the TCCB received at the control unit 110 to control a device, for<br>
instance, I/O device 112 via connection 126. The CU control logic 802 sends device<br>
commands and data to the I/O device 112, and receives status information and other<br>
feedback from the I/O device 112. When the CU control logic 802 receives data, such as the<br>
first checking block boundary of the 16K bytes of data 706 of FIG. 7, the CU control logic<br>
15<br>
802 writes this data received into data buffer 804 for temporary storage, until the CRC is<br>
received for the checking block boundary is checked, then that data may be sent to the I/O<br>
device 112. This continues for each checking block boundary until the I/O operation is<br>
completed.<br>
The control unit 110 may further include other queue or memory elements (not depicted) for<br>
storing additional message or status information associated with communications between<br>
the channel 124 and the I/O device 112.<br>
The channel 124 in the channel subsystem 108 includes elements to support communication<br>
with the control unit 110. For example, the channel 124 may include CHN control logic 806<br>
that interfaces with the gather data logic 812. The gather data logic 812 is described herein<br>
below in reference to FIG. 10. In an exemplary embodiment, the CHN control logic 806<br>
controls communication between the channel subsystem 108 and the control unit 110. The<br>
CHN control logic 806 may directly interface to the CU control logic 802 via the connection<br>
120 to send commands and receive responses, such as transport commands and response<br>
IUs. Alternatively, messaging interfaces and/or additional buffers (not depicted) can be<br>
placed between the CHN control logic 806 and the CU control logic 802. The CHN<br>
subsystem registers 814 can include fixed values that provide configuration and status<br>
information, as well as dynamic status information, updated as commands are transported<br>
and responses are received. The CHN subsystem registers 814 may be dedicated hardware<br>
registers and/or virtual registers established using memory mapping.<br>
In one embodiment, the CHN subsystem registers 814 include the TIDAL 410 and TIDAWs<br>
412 – 416 of FIG. 4 as memory mapped registers.<br>
One example of a TIDAW 900 is depicted in FIG. 9. The TIDAW 900 provides indirect<br>
addressing to data used in a TCW channel program, such as the TIDAWs 412 – 416 of FIG.<br>
4. The TIDAW 900 includes flags 902, a count 904, and an address 906. Each field (i.e.,<br>
flags 902, count 904, and address 906) in the TIDAW format 900 is assigned to a particular<br>
byte address to support parsing of the fields. Although one arrangement of fields within the<br>
TIDAW 900 is depicted in FIG. 9, it will be understood that the order of fields can be<br>
rearranged to alternate orderings.<br>
16<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the flags 902 include a last TIDAW flag and a transporttransfer<br>
in channel (T-TIC) flag, in addition to other flags. The last TIDAW flag indicates<br>
that the associated TIDAW is the last TIDAW in a TIDAL, consistent with the definition for<br>
a MIDAW. When count 904 goes to zero with the last TIDAW flag set, the data transfer for<br>
the associated I/O operation is complete. The T-TIC flag indicates whether the contents of<br>
the address 906 include data or the address of the next TIDAW in the TIDAL. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, when the T-TIC flag is set, then the address 906 in the TIDAW is<br>
the address of the next TIDAW in the TIDAL. In the manner, the address 906 may be<br>
utilized to access a TIDAW at a non-contiguous storage location from the current TIDAW.<br>
Thus, the TIDAW list can contain more than 256 entries, thereby exceeding the maximum<br>
number of allowable indirect data address words in current implementations. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, when the T-TIC flag is set the address 906 must have the four low<br>
order bits set to zero because the 16 byte TIDAW must be on a 16 byte address boundary.<br>
When the T-TIC flag is not set, then the address 906 in the TIDAW is the address of a<br>
portion of the data that makes up the data being gathered for the I/O operation. The size of<br>
the data is indicated in the count field 904. If the last TIDAW flag and the T-TIC flag are<br>
not set, then the next TIDAW is located in the next storage location (e.g., it is contiguous to<br>
the current TIDAW).<br>
Turning now to FIG. 10, a process 1000 for gathering data for an I/O operation will now be<br>
described in accordance with exemplary embodiments, and in reference to the I/O processing<br>
system 100 of FIG. 1. At block 1002, the channel subsystem 108 receives a control word for<br>
an I/O operation (e.g., a TCW). The control word includes an indirect data address that<br>
points to the starting address of a list of storage addresses (e.g,. a TIDAL having multiple<br>
TIDAWs) that make up the data utilized by the by the I/O operation. In exemplary<br>
embodiments, the data is customer data (e.g., data input or output from the I/O operation).<br>
In alternate exemplary embodiments, the data is control data (e.g., a TCCB). In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the list of storage addresses spans two or more non-contiguous<br>
storage locations.<br>
At block 1004, the data is gathered by instructions located at the channel subsystem 108.<br>
The gathering is based on the contents of the list. In an exemplary embodiment, each entry<br>
in the list (e.g., each TIDAW) includes both a storage address and a T-TIC flag to indicate<br>
17<br>
whether the storage address is the location of a portion of the data, or whether the storage<br>
address points to the location of another portion of the list containing more storage<br>
addresses. In this manner, a single TIDAL can be contained in multiple pages removing any<br>
restraints on the length of the TIDAL. When the T-TIC flag indicates that the storage<br>
address is the location of a portion of the data (e.g., the T-TIC flag is not set), then the data<br>
at the storage location is accessed and added to the data. This adding of new data can be<br>
performed in any manner known in the art, such as merging with data already gathered,<br>
appending to data already gathered, etc.<br>
When the T-TIC flag indicates that the current storage address is the location of another<br>
portion of the list, then processing continues by accessing a new TIDAW located at the<br>
specified storage location. Data at the storage location specified in the new TIDAW is<br>
accessed and added to the data. In an exemplary embodiment, the TIDAW includes a count<br>
904 to specify how much data to read (or write) from each storage address. When a TIDAW<br>
with the last TIDAW flag is set the gathering is completed. Otherwise, the next TIDAW is<br>
accessed and the data gathering continues.<br>
At block 1006, the data is transmitted to a control unit 110 by the channel subsystem 108.<br>
Technical effects of exemplary embodiments include providing non-contiguous indirect data<br>
addressing at a I/O subsystem. By allowing multiple 4k byte pages to contain the list of<br>
storage addresses (TIDAL) allows the number of TIDAWs to be unlimited, therefore more<br>
data can be associated with a single I/O operation. Large transfers of data can reduce<br>
communication overhead by avoiding additional handshaking and other delays associated<br>
with multiple smaller messages.<br>
The following examples depict manners in which exemplary embodiments may be utilized<br>
to perform more than moving large blocks of data.<br>
Exemplary embodiments may be utilized to aid in the prefixing of a channel program by an<br>
operating system. For example, when a channel program is passed to an operating system,<br>
the operating system may modify the channel program to add, replace, or modify command<br>
CCWs or DCWs. In an exemplary embodiment, this implies that a TCCB TIDAL will be<br>
created where the first TIDAW points to an area of storage containing the first part of the<br>
modified TCCB. The second TIDAW points to the remainder of the unmodified TCCB.<br>
18<br>
Exemplary embodiments may also be used to aid in the prefixing of channel programs by a<br>
hypervisor. If the hypervisor needs to modify the channel program, it would need to create a<br>
TIDAL with one more entry than the one passed by the guest. If the TIDAL passed by the<br>
guest is already the maximum size (256 TIDAWs), then the hypervisor can make its own<br>
modifications by creating a TCCB TIDAL that has two TIDAWs, one of which is the TTICs<br>
to the first TIDAW of the TIDAL passed by the guest.<br>
TIDAL T-TICs can also ease storage requirements for operating systems. If the channel<br>
program containing a TCCB TIDAL needs to be modified, it takes less storage to create a<br>
TIDAW and T-TIC than to allocated storage for the caller’s TCCB TIDAL plus one more<br>
TIDAW.<br>
As described above, embodiments can be embodied in the form of computer-implemented<br>
processes and apparatuses for practicing those processes. In exemplary embodiments, the<br>
invention is embodied in computer program code executed by one or more network<br>
elements. Embodiments include a computer program product 1100 as depicted in FIG. 11<br>
on a computer usable medium 1102 with computer program code logic 1104 containing<br>
instructions embodied in tangible media as an article of manufacture. Exemplary articles of<br>
manufacture for computer usable medium 1102 may include floppy diskettes, CD-ROMs,<br>
hard drives, universal serial bus (USB) flash drives, or any other computer-readable storage<br>
medium, wherein, when the computer program code logic 1104 is loaded into and executed<br>
by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the invention.<br>
Embodiments include computer program code logic 1104, for example, whether stored in a<br>
storage medium, loaded into and/or executed by a computer, or transmitted over some<br>
transmission medium, such as over electrical wiring or cabling, through fiber optics, or via<br>
electromagnetic radiation, wherein, when the computer program code logic 1104 is loaded<br>
into and executed by a computer, the computer becomes an apparatus for practicing the<br>
invention. When implemented on a general-purpose microprocessor, the computer program<br>
code logic 1104 segments configure the microprocessor to create specific logic circuits.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be<br>
understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may<br>
be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the invention. In<br>
addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the<br>
19<br>
