This application claims the benefit of prior filed provisional application 60/398,272, filed on July 23, 2002.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
I. Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of satellite communication systems, and more particularly, to satellite communication sysiems employing multi-beam satellites and having built-in redundancy.<br>
II. Related Art<br>
With advances in processor and related technologies, personal computing, whether it be for use in business or for pleasure, is now widely available to large segments of the population. Following the advances of networking and related technologies, many computing devices are now connected to private and/or public networks, such as the Internet or company Intranets, and have access to a wide variety of contents served by a broad range of content servers, such as the World Wide Web (WWW). However, many home or non-business computing users remain frustrated, as they do not have broacfcand access to support the increasingly rich multi-media<br>
contents.<br>
Wire line or fiber optical based broadband access, such as using Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) or Cable Modem systems, are currently very popular. However, wire line based solutions are expensive, and take a long time to achieve pervasive nation or continent wide deployment, if that is even possible, as they require physical cable lines to be installed throughout an entire service or deployment area. As a result, except for the major metropolitan areas or the most newly developed communities, users located in many smaller metropolitan areas or older communities remain without adequate high-speed access to any public or commercial data networks.<br><br>
[0005]	Wireless broadband access, if it can be provided efficiently, reliably and<br>
inexpensively, is not as restrictEd. That is, without installing expensive cable over long distances or in less than receptive terrain, every locale across a wide area, including entire countries may be more easily or cost effectively covered.<br>
[0006]	Concurrently, advances in satellite and related technologies have led to wide<br>
spread adoption of Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) for communication. MSS has rapidly moved from servicing simple paging functions to providing voice, and now, data applications, such as accessing a user's email or accessing the Internet or a company Intranet. Accordingly, a need exists to provide inexpensive and reliable satellite based data communication services to a large service area, such as the continental U.S. (referred to as CONUS). It has been believed that a satellite in geosynchronous orbit could service an area the size of the continental United States and provide desired data and services. Generally, Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are viewed as suited for voice traffic, where there is a need for little signal transit delay.<br>
[0007]	A number of challenges need to the overcome to provide such inexpensive and<br>
reliable satellite based data communication service to such a large service area. First of all, while it is possible for a single multi-beam satellite in a geostationary orbit to covef a service area the size of a laige country, such as CONTJS, a relMively large number of beams, in the range of several tens to a few hundred, would be required to achieve a desired communication link capacity. These beams form tightly-packed "cell" patterns to cover the service area to service a large number of users. However, such an approach has die disadvantage of being costly, as back-up satellites are also required by commercial communication systems to provide an appropriate level of redundancy and reliability, which users have come to depend upon when compared to terrestrial systems. Back up satellites also have to be equally capable of supporting the large number of beams required to cover the entire large service area.<br>
[OO08]	Moreover, it will severely strain the design of satellites employing antenna<br>
systems of the popular reflector type, as a large number of feed horns will have to be employed and tightly packed together for each of these reflector antennas. The tightly packed configuration will in turn affect the size of the apertures tiiat can be provided for these feed homs, which in turn negatively impacts beam characteristics such as gain and the beam quality.<br><br>
[0009]	Furthermore, the cellular pattern formed may be viewed in a manner similar to<br>
that of a terrestrial cellular pattern. In other words, a frequency re-use scheme has to be devised to enable a finite number of assigned or allocated frequencies to be used and shared by the large number of users located within the coverage areas of different, and adjacent, "cells".<br>
[0010]	There are also issues with considering and addressing inter-beam interference<br>
problems. Such interference needs to be kept to an absolute minimum, regardless of the back up satellite techniques used, as well as with the primary beam forming communications satellites.<br>
[0011]	Satellite communication systems, and associated terminals or wireless devices<br>
manufactured or operating using the teachings of the present invention advantageously addresses these and other challenges fo provide less expensive, and more reliable satellite based data communication services, over that of the prior art.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0030]	In the descriptions to follow, various embodiments of the present invention, and<br>
diffrent aspects of these embodiments will be described. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced with only some or all aspects of the various embodiments. For purposes of explanation, specific numbers, materials and configurations are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various embodiments. However, it will also be apparent to one skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced without the specific details. In other instances, well-known feature are omitted or simplified in order not to obscure the present invention.<br>
[0031]	Parts of the  description will be presented  using terminology commonly<br>
employed by those skilled in the art to convey the substance of their work K) others skilled in the art, such as beams, frequencies, antennas, reflectors, feed horns, ^lertures and so forth. Unless defined otherwise, these terms are to be given the broadest meanings as they are imderstood by those ordinarily skilled in the art.<br>
[0032]	Reference   herein   to   "one   embodiment",   "an   embodiment",   or   similar<br>
formulations, means that a particular feature, structure, operation, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment, is included in at kast one embodiment of the present invention. Thus, the appearances of such phrases or formulations herein arc not necessarily all referring to the same embodunent. Furhermore, various particular features, structures, operations, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.<br>
[0033]	A typical satellite communications system uses several sateLites in known<br>
orbital patterns to provide service for one or more wirsless user terminals by transferring signals between, that is to or from, such terminals and one or more gateways, ground stations or hubs.     Such systems  have the ability to provide<br><br>
communications capabilities or coverage over large geographical areas or regions. A typical satellite communications system might use on the order of 48 or more satellites residing in a series of well defined orbital planes, for example 6, to provide nearly global coverage.<br>
[0034]	The satellites can use either IDMA or CDMA type modulation or air interfaces<br>
for the signals on the forward or reverse links, or a combination thereof. A spread spectrum (SS) code division multiple access (CDMA) technique currently used in satellites is similar to the TIA/EIA Interim Standard, "Mobile Station-Base Station Compatibility Standard for Dual-Mode Wideband Spread Spectrum Cellular System" TIA/EIA/IS-95, July 1993, referred to as the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association (TIA/EIA) Standard IS-95. However, other spread spectrum and CDMA techniques and protocols, or even some types of Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems can be employed. Other communications systems are described in the International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System or IMT-2000/UM standards, covering what are commonly referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA). cdma2000 (such as cdma2000 Ix-rxtt cdma2000 Ix, 3x, or MC standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA. Satellite based communication systems also utilize these or similar known standards.<br>
[0035]	The use of particular modulation schemes does not operate as a limitation for<br>
embodiments the invention, although one scheme might be more efficient to use in a particular communication system than another depending on the design constraints and desired operating characteristics. The forward link (FL) refers to communication signals, or paths, being transferred or traveling from the gateway to the user terminals while the reverse link (RL) refers to communication signals traveling from the user terminals to the gateway.<br>
[0036]	The terminals discussed herein are adapted for communication with the<br>
satellites, and each have or include, by example, a plurality of different types of fixed and mobile user terminals including, but not limited to, a cellular telephone, wireless handset or other device, a wireless modem, a data transceiver, or a paging or position determination receiver, or mobile radio-telephones. Furthermore, user terminals can be hand-held, portable as in vehicle-mounted (including for example cars, trucks, boats,<br><br>
trains, and planes), or fixed, as desired. Wireless communication devices are also Sometimes referred to as user terminals, mobile stations, mobile units, subscriber units, mobile radios or radiotelephones, wireless units, or simply as 'users,' 'subscribers,' "terminals,' and 'mobiles' in some communication systems, depending on preference.<br>
[0037]	In addition, the satellites employ predetermined or designed beam patterns<br>
Created by beam-forming antenna structures for the transfer of signals within a given geographical region or ""footprint" of the satellite. The beam patterns can vary from circular to more elongated elliptical, or have various irregular shapes or gain distribution patterns, as would be known to those skilled in the art. Any suitable pattern Or set of patterns might be used according to a specific communication system design, and such patterns do not operate as a limitation for embodiments the invention. More or fewer numbers of beams may be used depending on the type or capacity of signals being used, geographical regions to be covered, number of terminals to be serviced, power available, frequencies avaiiabie, and other satellite or system design constraints known to system designers.<br>
[0038]	FIG. 1    illustrates    a   satellite-based   communication   system    useful    for<br>
implementing embodiments of the invention. As illustrated, a satellite communication system 100 is formed using a series of primary multi-beam satellites 110 there being '/n' such satellites in the communication system, where 771 is an integer and has a value greater than 1. Each satellite in the system is equipped or configunsd to project N/m beams to a region covering a service area 115 to make it possible to provide services for User terminals by transferring data and/or other communication signals, or commands, within the service area 115. When taken together, the m satellites, each prctducing m/m beams, generate or provide the JV beams desired to cover the service area. For the illustrated embodiment, m is equal to 3, although other values can clearly be used, as desired. Depending on the size of the chosen service area for die conmiunication system, N typically may range from around 30 to 120 total beams with service area 115.<br>
[0039]	The value selected for N will vary for different communication systems, and is<br>
based on many well known factors. For example, the overall size of the satellite footprint or service area to be covered, die quantity of trffic or signals to be transferred, and at what data rates, as well as the anticipated operating frequencies or reuse patterns, the beam shapes, and so forth, as would be known. While some beams can be made<br><br>
quite large, doing so might decrease the total number of terminals that can be accommonated or serviced, or cause interference with other beams or systems, and so forth. Using large numbers of small beams creates more complicated and costly antenna structures and design problems for satellites in terms of the number of transducers used, control systems, reliability, and power consumed.<br>
[0040]	A typical value is 16 beams on both the FL and RL, although these need not be<br>
equal in number, nor in size or symmetrical in shape and distribution pattern within the footprint. However, using different frequencies and FDM techniques, additional beams, referred to as 'sub-beams' can cover the same geogr^hical area, for example 8-13 sub-beams, or more, within a beam could be used to create a total of around 208 sub-beams per satellite. Embodiments of the invention are not limited to specific numbers of beams and can prove useful in a variety of configurations and communication systems.<br>
[0041]	ID accordance with one aspect of the present invention, n back-up multi-beam<br>
satellites 112 are also provided, with n also being an integer equal to or greater than 1. Each of the back-up multi-beam satellites 112 are also equipped to project N/m beams onto a desired surface area, or within a service area. In other words, the primary and the back-up multi-beam satellites are similarly constituted in terms of the number of beams being formed, the shape of the beams, over all footprints, and frequency and power control, although not all of these features need be identical. For the illustrated embodiment, n = 1.<br>
[0042]	Therefore, by being able to activate or switch communication paths or links for<br>
given beams to one or more of the back-up satellites, each of the n back-up satellites 112 may be selectively configured to replace a failed one of the m primary satellites 110. As a result, the present invention advantageously reduces the cost of providing redundancy over the single multi-beam satellite approach, as long as n is smaller than m. This is due to the fact that the cost of providing a back-up satellite with the capability of projecting NAn beams is generally relatively less expensive than the cost to provide a back-up satellite capable of projecting N beams. In addition, the larger number of beams being serviced by a given satellite increases physical and operational complexity which also increases the risk of operational failure.<br>
[0043]	Satellites, such as satellite 110 may be placed into one of a variety of oibits, fw<br>
example, a low Earth orbit (LEO); a middle Earth orbit (MEO); or a geosynchronous<br><br>
orbit (GEO), each having well known or understood characteristics. A geosynchronoos orbit sometimes referred to as a geostationary orbit. One exemplary geosynchronous orbit has 3n orbital period of 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 41 seconds, which has the effect of causing a satellite to appear to reside in a stationary location above the surface of the Earth.<br>
[0044]	Except for the fact that each satellite 110 and 112 is multi-beam type, and tlie<br>
manner in which they are used in advantageously forming the less expulsive, and more reliable satellite communication system of the present invention, satellites 110 and 112 otherwise represent a broad range of communication satellites whose structure and operation are known in the art. Any suitable ones of these known or to be developed satellites may be employed to practice the present invention. However, the satellites need not be identical in all aspects as longs as they provide the desired beam coverage, and associated power and command controls expected within the communication system.<br>
[0045]	FIG. 2 illustrates an example of beam projections for each of the satellites,<br>
primary of back-up, in accordance with one embodiment. As illustrated, in accordance with this aspect of the present invention, in addition to having to ordy provide N/m beams (as opposed to N beams), each of the N/m beams of a satellite, primary or back¬up, is projected in what is referred to as a loosely- packed array manner 120. That is, the beams are projected from satellites in a manner that forms a pattern with the adjacent beams spaced apart or separated from each other by some pre-selected distance,<br>
[0046]	As a result, as those skilled in the art will appreciate, the feed horns of the<br>
transferring antennas of these satellites 110 and 112 may likewise be arranged in a loosely-packed configuration, which reduces the physical constraints placed on the design of the antennas. In this configuration, this allows relatively larger apertures to be used for the feed horns. The configuration results in better quality beam, in particulaf, with respect to the gain characteristics of these beams. Since the beam forming antennas or structm«s of a satellite 110 or 112 are typicaUy coupled to or formed using transmission and/or reception elements commonly refisired to as "transponders", this also simplifies design and arrangement of the transponders.<br><br>
[0047J	Furthermore, for various embodiments, the N/m beams of each satellite, be it a<br>
primary or back-up, can be configured such that each of the N/m beam coverage areas or spots is spaced apart by one beam width from each other or each adjacent beam projected spot or footprint (within the satellite spot or footprint). Accordingly, for the embodiment where m = 3 and n = 1, back-up satellite U2 may be efficiendy reconfigured to replace a failed one of the primary satellites 110, by having each of its N/m beams reposilioned or moved within the satellite footprint by one beam width. That is, the beams for satellites 112 are normally positioned within the separation gaps or spaces for the primary satellites 110, between the beams of satellites 110, and are generally easily redirected out of the gap and onto a desired primaty coverage area without a great deal of complex operation or control, and with littie delay. The beam forming antennas are readjusted to project beams at a slightly different angle relative to the surface of a coverage region. Therefore, an efficient and highly responsive replacement is provided in the case of a primary satellite or beam failure.<br>
(0048)	This latter operational characteristic for embodiments of the invention are in<br>
great contrast to typical communication systems that maintain "in orbit" spares or spare satellites that must be moved over some period of time into a new orbital position in order to replace a failed or mal-functioning satellite. The large amount of delay, and cosi, for such an operation is eliminated using the new technique, which greatly impacts customer or user satisfaction, with not being "cut-off' for long periods, and increases revenue by reducing down-time for any given region. It is also in contrast to having to replace an entire satellite as a failed satellite even if problem with only a couple of beams are causing an impairment within the communication system, which might be resolved over time, eliminating the need for entire satellite replacement.<br>
[0049]	In  accordance with  another aspect of the present invention, in various<br>
embodiments, the N/m beams of a satellite HO or 112 are advantageously projected across the service area. Thus, when service area 115 is comprised of different regions having peak demands at different time periods, the manner of projection effectively performs automatic load balancing among the operating satellites 110. That is, the beams of back up satellites can be used to absorb an additional transient load, without requiring a full time stationing of a more expensive satellite to cover such areas of peak<br><br>
use which other have a limited period of use, and would wise under-utilize the capacity of the satellite.<br>
[0050]	For example, one could employ the 3-satellite embodiment of FIG. 1  to<br>
constitute a satellite communication system to provide data service, such as for Internet access, to the continental United States, also referred to in the art as CONUS- In addition many companies may want to provide access to their respective corporate or enterprise level Intranet networks. Historically Intranet access tends'to peak during mid-day hours, and Internet access tends to peak during the early evening hours, with the early evening hours of some time zones, here mountain and pacific time zones, lagging behind others, the eastern and central time zones. This configuration automatically achieves load balancing by having each of the operating satellites share the peak load (as compared to the alternative configuration of having each of 3 satellites cover the eiBtem, the central, and the western portions of CONUS).<br>
[0051]	FIG. 3A illustrates a portion of the generally cellular patera that typically<br>
nssnlls from the beam projections, and frequency band assignments, in accordance with one embodiment. FIG. 3B illustrates how the beam patterns of FIG. 3A could be projected on CONUS in accordance with one embodiment.<br>
[0052]	As described earlier, each of satellites 110 projects N/m beams onto the service<br>
area 115 to facilitate communication. Collectively, the m x N/m beams cover the whole service area fonning the cellular pattern illustrated.<br>
[0053]	In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, the available<br>
frequencies are divided into m bands; which for m = 3 would comprise 3 bands, here labeled as frequency band 1 (FBI), frequency band 2 (FB2) and frequency band 3 (FB3). The N/m beams of each satellite 110 are assigned to facilitate communication over 1 of the m band of frequencies. That is, for the m = 3 embodiment, all N/m beams of satellite 1 facilitate communieation over frequencies of FBI. all N/m beams of satellite 2 facilitate conamunication over frequencies of FB2, and so forth. As a result, when coupled with the loosely-packed array projection scheme, the proper assignment of the frequency bands causes communication in adjacent "cells" (beams) to be conducted over different frequencies, which in turn reduces the likelihood of inter-beam interferences between communications within different "cells".<br><br>
[0054]	FIG. 4 iilustrates the operational flow or method of operation for a satellite<br>
communication system constituted in accordance with the teachings of the invention, as earlier described, in accordance with one embodiment. As illustrated, in a step or processing stage 402, the N/m beams of a primary multi-beam satellite 110 are configured to project in a loosely packed array manner across an entire service area. Next, in step 404, each of the N/m beams of the primary multi-beam satellite 110 is configured to facilitate communication over one of the m bands of frequencies.<br>
[0055]	In a step or process 406, it is determined whether or not all primary satellites<br>
have been so coniigured. If not, the process returns to step 402, from which it continues, and configuration is performed on another primary satellite 110. The process continues, until it is eventually determined in processing step 406 that all primary satellites 110 of interest have been configured as desired. At which time, the process continues in process or method step 408, where it is determined whether or not one of the primary satellites has failed. If no failure is detected, the system continues to operate, and the process returns to step 408 periodically to check for primary satellite failures.<br>
[0056]	Eventually, when a primary satellite failure is detected, the N/m beams of a<br>
selected one of the back-up satellites is configured to project in a loosely packed array manner, and across the service area, step 410 as earlier described. Moreover, each of the N/m beams of the selected back-up satellite 112 is configured to facilitate communication in the 1 of m bands of frequencies previously assigned to the failed primary satellite, in step or processing stage 412.<br>
[0057]	Finally, each of the N/m beams of the back-up satellite is re-positioned to allow<br>
the selected back-up satellite to replace the failed one of the primary satellite. Recall from earlier description that in various embodiments, each of the N/m beams of the back-up satellite is easily re-positioned by one beam width to be in position to replace a failed primary satellite.<br>
[0058]	Understood from the above discussions is the fact that the various user terminals<br>
and gateways are configured to communicate signals through or with both or either the primary and back-up satellites. The gateways and terminals employ various communication circuits or means in accordance with the chosen modulation schemes for a given communication system of interest, which are used to generate, transmit.<br><br>
and for receive signals within the appropriate frequency bands, and using the desired modulation schemes or techniques. Such techniques and factors, such as antenna structures, power control, and so forth are otherwise well understood by those skilled in the art, and their specific detailed implementations within the gateways and user terminals are not explmned further in detail herein.<br>
[0059]	Thus, it can be seen from the above description, a less espensive and more<br>
reliable satellite communication system, suitable for facilitating data communication, in particular, network accesses, such as for the Internet, for a wide service area, has been described.<br>
[0060]	Various embodiments of the present invention, especially as implemented in the<br>
gateways, require computational resources to carryout the above-described functionality. FIG. 5 illustrates one embodiment of a hardware system intended to represent a broad category of computer systems such as personal computers, workstations, and/or embedded systems. In ttie illustrated embodiment, the hardware system includes processor 510 coupled to high speed bus 505, which is coupled to input/output (I/O) bus 515 through bus bridge 530. Temporary memory 520 is coupled to bus 505. Pennanent memory 540 is coupled to bus 515. I/O device(s) 550 is also coupled to bus 515. 1/0 device(s) 550 may include a display device, a keyboard, one or more external network interfaces, etc.<br>
[0061]	Certain embodiments may include additional components, may not require all of<br>
the above components, or may combine one or more components. For instance, temporary memory 520 may be on-chip with, processor 510. Alternatively, pennanent memory 540 may be eliminated and temporary memory 520 may be replaced with an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM), whensin software routines are executed in place from the EEPROM. Some implementations may employ a single bus. to which ail of ^e components are coupled, or one or more additional buses and bus bridges to which various additional components can be coupled. Those skilled in the art will be familiar with a variety of alternative internal networks including, for instance, an internal network based on a high speed system bus with a memory controller hub and an I/O controller hub. Additional components may include additional processors, a CD ROM drive, additional memories, and other peripheral components known in the art.<br><br>
{00621	In one embodiment, the present invention, as described above, is implemented<br>
using one or more hardware systems such as the hardware system of FIG. 5. Where more than one computer is used, the systems can be coupled to communicate over an externa! network, such as a local area network (LAN), an internet protocol (IP) network, etc. In one embodiment, the present invention is implemented as software routines executed by one or more execution units within the computers). For a given computer, the software routines can be stored on a storage device, such as perrnanent memory 540.<br>
[0063]	As would be apparent to one skilled in the art, various functions of circuit<br>
elements may also be implemented as processing operations in a software program. Such software may be employed in, for example, a digital signal processor, micro¬controller, or general-purpose computer. As shown in HG. 6, the software routines can be machine executable instructions 610 stored using any suitable machine readable storage medium 620, such as a diskette, CD-ROM, magnetic tape, digital video or versatile disk PVD), laser disk, ROM, Flash memory, etc. The series of instmctions need not be stored locally, and could be received from a remote storage device, such as a server on a network, a CD ROM device, a floppy disk, etc., through, for instance, I/O device(s)550 of FIG. 5.<br>
[0064]	From whatever source, the instructions may be copied from the storage device<br>
mto temporary memory 520 and then accessed and executed by processor 510. In one implementation, these software routines are written in the C programming language. It is to be appreciated, however, that these routines may be implemented in any of a wide variety of programming languages.<br>
[0065]	In alternative embodiments, discrete hardware or firmware may be used.   For<br>
example, various aspects of the present invention may be implemented as circuit-based solutions, including possible implementation on one or more application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) e programmed with one or more of the above described Junctions of the present invention. In another example, one or more functions of the present invention could be implemented in one or more ASICs on additional circuit boards and the circuit boards could be inserted into computer(s) described above. In another example, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or static prograrrunable gate arrays (SPGA) could be used to implement one or more functions of the present<br><br>
invention.  In yet another example, a combination of hardware and software could be<br>
used to implement one or more functions of the present invention.<br>
