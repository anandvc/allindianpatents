				<td>Description<br>
Method and apparatus for transmitting data frames, and<br>
a method and apparatus for data rate matching<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an<br>
apparatus for transmitting data frames and to a method<br>
and an apparatus for data rate matching, in particular<br>
by using a repetition of bits to be transmitted.<br>
Digital communications systems are designed for<br>
transmitting data by representing the data in a form<br>
that facilitates the transmission of the data via a<br>
communication medium. For example, in the case of radio<br>
transmissions the data are transmitted, represented as<br>
radio signals, between transmitters and receivers of<br>
the communications system. In the case of broadband<br>
telecommunications networks, the data can be<br>
represented as light, and can be transmitted, for<br>
example, via a fiber optic network between transmitters<br>
and receivers in the system.<br>
During the transmission of data, bits or symbols of the<br>
transmitted data can be corrupted, with the effect that<br>
these bits or symbols cannot be correctly determined in<br>
the receiver. For this reason, the data communications<br>
systems frequently contain means for moderating the<br>
corruption of the data that occurs during the<br>
transmission. One of these means consists in equipping<br>
transmitters in the system with coders that code the<br>
data before transmission in accordance with an error<br>
control code. The error control code is designed such<br>
that it adds redundancy to the data in a controlled<br>
fashion. In the receiver, errors that occur during<br>
transmission can<br>
be corrected by decoding the error control code, as a<br>
result of which the original data are reproduced. The<br>
decoding is effected by using an error decoding<br>
algorithm that corresponds to the error control code,<br>
which is known to the receiver.<br>
After the data have been coded, it is frequently<br>
necessary for the purpose of data rate matching to<br>
puncture or to repeat data bits or symbols from a block<br>
of coded data before these data are transmitted. The<br>
term puncturing/repetition is intended here to signify<br>
a process of removing or deleting bits from a coded<br>
data block with the effect that the punctured bits are<br>
not transmitted with this data block, or to signify a<br>
process of repeating bits from a coded data block with<br>
the effect that the bits to be repeated are transmitted<br>
several times with this data block. Even if only one<br>
term "puncturing" or "repetition" is commonly used<br>
below, it goes without saying that the present<br>
invention can also be used for the other case of<br>
"repetition" or "puncturing".<br>
The puncturing could be required, for example, because<br>
a multiple access method that serves for transmitting<br>
the data via the data-carrying media requires<br>
formatting of the data to form blocks of predetermined<br>
size, which size does not correspond to the size of the<br>
coded data frame.<br>
In order to accommodate the coded data frame in the<br>
transport data block of the predetermined size, data<br>
bits are therefore either punctured from the coded data<br>
frame in order to reduce the size of the coded data<br>
block,<br><br>
in a case in which the coded data frame is larger than<br>
the size of the transport block, or bits in, the coded<br>
data frame are repeated, in a case in which the coded<br>
data frame is smaller than the predetermined size of<br>
the transport block. In a case in which the data frame<br>
is smaller than the transport data block, the data bits<br>
(bits) or data symbols are repeated to the extent<br>
necessary to fill the rest of the transport data block.<br>
Those skilled in the art are familiar with the fact<br>
that one effect of puncturing a coded data frame is<br>
that the probability of correct reproduction of the<br>
original data is reduced. Moreover, the performance of<br>
known error control codes and of decoders for these<br>
error control codes is best when the errors that occur<br>
during the transmission of the data are caused by<br>
Gaussian noise, since this has the effect that the<br>
errors are distributed independently over the transport<br>
data block. When a coded data frame is intended to be<br>
punctured, the positions in the coded data frame at<br>
which bits are punctured are to be separated as far as<br>
possible from one another. To this extent, the<br>
puncturing positions should be distributed uniformly<br>
over the data frame. Since errors during transmission<br>
frequently occur in bursts, particularly in the case of<br>
radio communications systems that do not use<br>
interleaving, and since the repetitions of bits are not<br>
intended particularly to raise the quality only in a<br>
certain region of the data frame but as uniformly as<br>
possible, bit positions in a coded or uncoded data<br>
frame at which data bit3 are intended to be repeated<br>
should also be arranged such that they are uniformly<br>
separated from one another in the entire data frame.<br><br>
Known methods for selecting the positions of bits or<br>
symbols that are intended to be punctured or repeated<br>
in a coded data frame include the division of the<br>
number of bits or symbols in a frame by the number of<br>
bits or symbols that are intended to be punctured or<br>
repeated, and the selection of the bit positions with<br>
integral values corresponding to the division. In a<br>
case in which the number of bits to be punctured is not<br>
an integral division of the number of bits in the data<br>
frame, this does not, however, lead to a uniform<br>
spacing of the punctured or repeated bit positions,<br>
thus resulting in the disadvantage that specific bit<br>
positions are situated closer to one another than this<br>
whole number, are situated further (in part<br>
substantially further) removed from one another than<br>
this whole number, and in some cases even alongside one<br>
another.<br>
The interleaving in a transport multiplexing method is<br>
frequently carried out in two steps. The various<br>
solutions for carrying out the puncturing/repetition<br>
have specific consequences when the puncturing is<br>
carried out downstream of the first interleaver as is<br>
provided for the UMTS system. It is necessary here to<br>
take particular notice of the fact that the performance<br>
could deteriorate when a block interleaver with a<br>
column exchange, such as the FS-MIL (FS Multistage<br>
Interleaver) used in UMTS, is used as interleaver in<br>
the up-link multiplexing method in conjunction with a<br>
rate matching algorithm. Downstream of said first<br>
Lnterleaver, the bits assigned to a frame are further<br>
Interleaved by a second interleaver that is described,<br>
for example, in TS 25.212 Chapter "4.2.11 2nd<br>
interleaving". This<br><br>
second interleaver has no influence, however, on<br>
aspects of the puncturing/repetition and is therefore<br>
not taken further into account below; it is of no<br>
importance with regard to the present invention.<br>
Consequently, the above-named first interleaver is<br>
frequently also simply named interleaver in this<br>
document.<br>
A block interleaver with column exchange functions as<br>
follows: firstly, the bits are written rowwise into a<br>
matrix. This matrix comprises F columns, F being the<br>
number of frames (also frequently termed radio frames<br>
or columns below) over which the data of a data frame<br>
are distributed. See also TS 25.212 Chapter "4.2.5 1st<br>
interleaving".<br>
In the current version of the UMTS standard<br>
(3GPP TSG RAN WG1; Multiplexing and channel coding<br>
(FDD); TS 25.212 V2.3.0 (1999-10)) Chapter "4.2.7 Rate<br>
matching", in particular section "4.2.7.1.2"<br>
Determination of parameters needed for calculating the<br>
rate matching pattern", a method is represented that<br>
was presented in the article R1-99641 (Siemens;<br>
Properties of optimised puncturing scheme; TSG-RAN<br>
WG1#5, June 1-4, Cheju, Korea). This method distributes<br>
punctured bits as uniformly as possible and, in<br>
particular, avoids the case of puncturing of bits<br>
situated close to one another. This is also achieved<br>
for the case of the application of puncturing using the<br>
interframe interleaver. The same method can also be<br>
applied for the case of repetition, and likewise leads<br>
in this case to good results.<br>
In the article Rl-99641 mentioned, the following<br>
modifications were proposed to the rate matching<br>
method: the rate matching was carried out<br><br>
using the puncturing/repetition pattern by applying a<br>
common pattern to all frames, the pattern being<br>
displaced in the case of the individual frames. Use was<br>
made for calculating the displacement of simple<br>
calculating rules that take account of the effect of<br>
the column exchange by the interleaver (for example an<br>
FS-MIL, the term column exchange, sometimes also termed<br>
column randomizing, is used here instead of "row-by-row<br>
processing").<br>
Owing to the fact that the operation of column exchange<br>
is taken into account in the formulas, the same effect<br>
is achieved as if the rate matching were carried out<br>
upstream of the column exchange of the interleaver,<br>
although for practical reasons it must be carried out<br>
downstream thereof. This is achieved by virtue of the<br>
fact that use is made of the column exchange rule, more<br>
precisely its inversion RF in the formulas for<br>
calculating S (the displacement of the pattern per<br>
column) or eoffset (a parameter that is carried out per<br>
frame in the rate matching algorithm presented further<br>
below). Similar procedures can be used for puncturing<br>
and repetition, this invention specifically dealing<br>
with the case of repetition. The carrying out,<br>
necessary owing to other prescriptions, of the rate<br>
matching downstream of the first interleaver has<br>
consequences in this case for the optimum generation of<br>
puncturing and repetition patterns.<br>
However, it has emerged (as set forth below) that the<br>
previously proposed solutions, that is to say the<br>
proposed puncturing pattern in the case of application<br>
as a repetition pattern, is still not always optimal in<br>
all cases. Starting therefrom, it is the object of the<br>
invention to reduce the disadvantages of the prior<br><br>
art. In particular, it is the object of the present<br>
invention to specify a technical teaching that permits<br>
decoding of good quality in the receiver, particularly<br>
in the case of the repetition of bits.<br>
This object is achieved by means of the features of the<br>
independent claims. Developments of the invention<br>
follow from the subclaims.<br>
Consequently, the invention is based on the finding<br>
that the decoding result in the receiver depends on the<br>
repetition patterns in the transmitter, and the<br>
criteria for a good puncturing pattern and a good<br>
repetition pattern differ from one another. An<br>
improvement in performance by comparison with the<br>
patterns presented in R1-99641 can be achieved for the<br>
case of repetition by taking particular account of the<br>
criteria that are relevant for a good repetition<br>
pattern when determining the repetition pattern.<br>

An exemplary embodiment of the present invention is<br>
described with reference to a mobile radio<br>
communications system. Mobile radio communications<br>
systems are equipped with multiple access systems that<br>
operate, for example, in accordance with multiple access<br>
in time division multiplexing (TDMA) such as, for<br>
example, that used in the Global System for Mobile<br>
communications (GSM), a mobile radio communications<br>
standard standardized by the European Telecommunications<br>
Standard Institution. As "an alternative, the mobile<br>
radio communications system could be equipped with a<br>
multiple access system that operates in accordance with<br>
multiple access in code division multiplexing (CDMA)<br>
such as, for example, the UMTS system proposed for the<br>
universal third-generation mobile telecommunications<br>
system. However, it is clear that to illustrate an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention use could<br>
be made of any desired data communications system such<br>
as, for example, a local data network or a broadband<br>
telecommunications network that operates in accordance<br>
with the asynchronous transmission mode. These exemplary<br>
data communications systems are characterized, in<br>
particular, in that data are transmitted as frames,<br>
packets or blocks. In the case of a mobile radio<br>
communications system, the data are transported in<br>
frames of data-carrying radio signals that constitute a<br>
predetermined data size. An example of such a mobile<br>
radio communications system is shown in FIGURE 2.<br><br>
Shown in FIGURE 2 are three base stations BS that<br>
exchange radio signals with mobile stations MS in a<br>
radio coverage area that is formed by cells 1 that are<br>
defined by dashed lines 2. The base stations BS are<br>
coupled together with the aid of a network relay system<br>
NET. The mobile stations MS and the base stations BS<br>
exchange data by transmitting radio signals, denoted by<br>
4, between antennas 6 that are coupled to the mobile<br>
stations MS and to the base stations BS. The data are<br>
transmitted between the mobile stations MS and the base<br>
stations BS by using a data communications apparatus in<br>
which the data are transformed into radio signals 4<br>
that are transmitted to the receiving antenna 6, which<br>
identifies the radio signals. The data are reproduced<br>
from the radio signals by the receiver.<br>
FIGURE 3 shows an example of a data communications<br>
apparatus that forms a radio communication link between<br>
one of the mobile stations MS and one of the base<br>
stations BS, elements that also appear in FIGURE 2<br>
bearing identical numerical designations.<br>
In FIGURE 3, a data source 10 produces data frames 8 at<br>
a rate that is determined by a data type produced by<br>
the source. The data frames 8 produced by the source 10<br>
are fed to a rate converter 12 that acts to convert the<br>
data frames 8 to transport data blocks 14. The<br>
transport data blocks 14 are designed such that they<br>
are substantially of the same size, with a<br>
predetermined size and an amount of data that can be<br>
carried by frames of data-carrying radio signals, via<br>
which data are transmitted by a radio interface<br><br>
that is formed by a pair comprising a transmitter 18<br>
and receiver 22.<br>
The data transport block 14 is fed to a radio access<br>
processor 16 that acts to control the sequence of the<br>
transmission of the transport data block 14 via the<br>
radio access interface. At an appropriate time, the<br>
transport data block 14 is fed by the radio access<br>
processor 16 to a transmitter 18 that acts to convert<br>
the transport data block to the frame of data-carrying<br>
radio signals, which are transmitted in a time interval<br>
that is allocated to the transmitter in order to effect<br>
the transmission of the radio signals. In the receiver<br>
22, a receiver antenna 6" identifies the radio signals<br>
and carries out downward conversion and reproduction of<br>
the data frame, which is fed to a radio access sequence<br>
control inverting apparatus 24. The radio access<br>
sequence control inverting apparatus 24 feeds the<br>
received data transport block to a frame conversion<br>
inverting apparatus 26 under the control of the<br>
multiple access sequence control inverting apparatus<br>
24, which is effected via a conductor 28. The rate<br>
conversion inverting apparatus 2 6 thereafter feeds a<br>
representation of the reproduced data frame 8 to a<br>
destination or sink for the data frame 8, which is<br>
represented by the block 30.<br>
The rate converter 12 and the rate conversion inverting<br>
apparatus 26 are designed such that, as Tar as<br>
possible, they utilize optimally the data-carrying<br>
capacity available in the transport data block 14. This<br>
is effected in accordance with the exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention by means of the rate matching<br>
converter 12, which acts to code the data frame and<br>
subsequently puncture<br><br>
or repeat data bits or symbols that are selected from<br>
the coded data frame, with the effect of producing a<br>
transport data block that fits into the data blocks 14.<br>
The rate converter 12 has a coder and a puncturer. The<br>
data frame 8 fed to the coder is coded in order to<br>
produce a coded data frame that is fed to the<br>
puncturer. The coded data frame is then punctured by<br>
the puncturer in order to produce the data transport<br>
block 14.<br>
Puncturing or repetition is achieved by virtue of the<br>
fact that a common puncturing pattern or repetition<br>
pattern is applied in the various frames in a fashion<br>
displaced relative to one another. Although the<br>
puncturing/repetition is applied downstream of the<br>
interradio frame interleaver, the same effect, that is<br>
to say the same puncturing/repetition pattern, is<br>
achieved as if the puncturing/repetition were applied<br>
before the column exchange.<br>
The aim of a good repetition method is to distribute<br>
the repeated bits as uniformly as possible. The same<br>
also holds for a good puncturing method. The method<br>
presented in the abovementioned article R1-99641<br>
operates as represented below (for the sake of<br>
simplicity, puncturing/repetition is not always written<br>
below, but only one alternative, it being obvious that<br>
the argument can also be applied for the other<br>
alternative): the most uniform distribution can be<br>
achieved when each nth bit is repeated. If the<br>
repetition rate is not integral, the spacing must be<br>
varied, that is to say sometimes the nth and sometimes<br>
the n+1th bit must be repeated. An attempt can be made<br>
also to apply this principle when the repetition is<br>
applied downstream<br><br>
of the first interleaver, although there is a further<br>
secondary condition in this case: the repeated bits<br>
must be distributed uniformly over all radio frames.<br>
An interleaving interval of 80 ms and a repetition rate<br>
of 1:6 are to be adopted as an example. If each 6th bit<br>
were repeated, only bits in the columns 0,2,4,6 but not<br>
in the columns 1,3,5,7, which cannot, of course, be<br>
carried out thus. In order to distribute the<br>
repetitions uniformly over all columns, the repetition<br>
interval must be modified sometimes (in this case,<br>
once) in order to prevent always the same columns from<br>
being punctured. This is shown in figure 4. The<br>
horizontal arrows with thin outlines show a repetition<br>
spacing of 6, and the horizontal arrow with a thick<br>
outline shows a repetition spacing, differing<br>
therefrom, of 5, in order to avoid repeating the first<br>
column too early a second time. After each column has<br>
been repeated once, the repetition pattern can be<br>
displaced downward by 6 rows, in order thus to<br>
determine the next bits to be repeated, and so on.<br>
Clearly this is equivalent to puncturing each 6th bit<br>
in a column and displacing this puncturing pattern in<br>
different columns relative to one another.<br>
The formulas are specified below, with the aid of the<br>
example of puncturing, for the optimized method that is<br>
defined in the abovementioned article Rl-99641 and is<br>
best suited to the case of puncturing.<br>
The number of bits per radio frame before the rate<br>
matching can be denoted by Nc, the number of the bits<br>
per radio frame after the rate matching by Ni, the<br>
index or the position of a<br><br>
bit to be punctured/repeated by mj, the frame number by<br>
k, and the number of frames over which the interleaving<br>
is carried out by F. We consider essentially the case<br>
that Nc &gt; Ni, that is to say puncturing. However, the<br>
formulas can also be applied for repetition. In the<br>
above example, it holds that Nc = 20, Ni = 16, mi = 4,<br>
m2 = 9, m3 = 14, m4 = 19, k = 1...7, and F = 8. The<br>
displacement of the puncturing pattern can then be<br>
achieved with the aid of the following formulas.<br>
-- calculation of the mean puncturing spacing<br>
q: = (Nc/ (/Ni-Nc/)) mod F —- here ? ? signifies rounding<br>
and // the absolute value.<br>
Q: = (LNC/ (/Ni-Nc/)?) div F<br>
if q is even - treat special case:<br>
then q = q - lcd(q, F)/F<br>
— here, led (q, F) denotes the greatest common<br>
divisor of q and F<br>
— the greatest common divisor can easily be<br>
calculated by bit manipulations when F is a power of<br>
two.<br>
— For the same reason, calculations with p can<br>
easily be carried out by binary fixed-point operations,<br>
(or, alternatively, by integer arithmetic with the use<br>
of displacement operations.<br>
endif<br>
— calculation of S and T; S represents the<br>
displacement of the row mod F and T the absolute<br>
displacement value div F;<br>
S therefore represents the displacement of the row with<br>
respect to q (that is to say mod F), and T the absolute<br>
displacement value with respect to Q (that is to say<br>
div F);<br>
for i = 0 to F-1<br>
S(RF (?i*q? mod F) ) = (?i*q? div F) -- ? ?<br>
signifying rounding up.<br>
T((RF(? i*q ? mod F)) = i -- RF(k) inverts the<br>
interleaver,<br><br>
end for<br>
In a real implementation, these formulas can be<br>
implemented as a reference table, as shown in figure 5.<br>
The table also includes the effect of the the column<br>
exchange taken into account by RF(k). S can obviously<br>
be calculated from T as a further implementation<br>
option.<br>
It is then possible to calculate eoffset as follows:<br>
eoffset (k) = {(2*S) + 2*T*Q + 1)* y + 1) mod 2Nc<br>
With the aid of eoffset (k), e is then preloaded in the<br>
rate matching method for UMTS. This choice of eoffset<br>
obviously effects a displacement of the puncturing<br>
patterns of the columns relative to one another by the<br>
amount S + T * Q.<br>
eoffset is sometimes also termed einint The rate matching<br>
method for UMTS, which is applied inside a single<br>
frame, is described in TS25.212, section 4.2.7.4 "Rate<br>
matching pattern determination", and describes a<br>
puncturing or repetition method based on an error<br>
control. This method is described here once more:<br>
before the rate matching, the bits may be denoted as<br>
follows:<br>
Xi,1, Xi,2, xi,3, Xi,4, ... Xi,N, in which case i denotes<br>
the number of the transport channel (TrCH number) and N<br>
is the parameter that is defined in chapter 4.2.7.2 of<br>
TS 25.212.<br>
The rate matching algorithm then operates as follows:<br>
if puncturing is to be carried out:<br>
e - eini — initial error between the current and<br>
desired puncturing rate<br><br>
m = 1 -- Index for the currently<br>
treated bit<br>
do while m 
e = e - eminus -- match error value<br>
if e 
number m is to be punctured<br>
puncture bit xi,m<br>
e = e + epluS-- match error value<br>
end if<br>
m = m + 1 -- next bit<br>
end do<br>
else<br>
e = eini -- Initial error between the<br>
current and desired puncturing rate<br>
m = 1 -- Index for the currently<br>
treated bit<br>
do while m 
e = e - eminus -- Match error value<br>
do while e 
number m is to be repeated<br>
repeat bit xi,m<br>
e = e + eplus-- match error value<br>
end do<br>
m = m + 1 -— next bit<br>
end do<br>
end if<br><br>
a repeated bit is inserted immediately after the bit<br>
originally already present.<br>
Described below is a simplified representation which<br>
simply results from the fact that the calculation of q<br>
and Q is not carried out separately for the remainder<br>
in the case of the division by F and the multiple of F,<br>
but in a combined fashion for both components. In the<br>
same way, S and T cannot be calculated separately for q<br>
and Q, but are likewise calculated in a combined<br>
fashion. The substitution q+F*Q ? q and S+Q*T ? S<br>
yields the following equivalent representation.<br>
Depending on the details of the implementation, one or<br>
other calculation method (or further methods likewise<br>
equivalent thereto) can be carried out more favorably.<br>
— Calculation of the mean puncturing distance<br>
q: = (LNc/( |Ni-Nc|)?) — ? ? signifying rounding down and<br>
| | signifying absolute value.<br>
if q is even -- treat special case:<br>
then q = q - lcd(q, F) /F -- led (q, F) signifying<br>
the greatest common divisor of q and F<br>
-- note that led can easily be calculated by bit<br>
manipulations, because F is a power of two.<br>
-- For the same reason, calculations with q can<br>
easily be carried out with the aid of binary fixed-<br>
point arithmetic (or integer arithmetic and a few shift<br>
operations).<br>
endif<br>
-- Calculation of S(k) of the displacement of column k;<br>
for i = 0 to F-1<br>
S(RF([i*ql mod F) ) = (i*ql div F) — [ ] signifying<br>
rounding up.<br><br>
-- RF{k) inverts the interleaver<br>
end for<br>
It is then possible to calculate eoffset in the following<br>
way:<br>
eoffSet (k) = ((2*S)* y + 1) mod 2Nc<br>
With the aid of eOffset (k), e is then initialized in<br>
advance in the rate matching method.<br>
Those skilled in the art know that the constant 1 used<br>
in this definition of eoffset can also be replaced by any<br>
other value if it is identical for all columns or<br>
frames. For reasons of simplified representation, this<br>
will not be examined explicitly below. Furthermore, the<br>
methods presented can be still further modified or<br>
expanded, although the basic assumptions are retained.<br>
If the puncturing rate is an odd-numbered fraction, for<br>
example 1:5 or 1:9, this method produces the same<br>
perfect puncturing pattern that would be applied<br>
directly before interleaving by puncturing with the use<br>
of the rate matching method- In other cases, adjacent<br>
bits are never punctured, but a distance between<br>
punctured bits can be greater than the others by up to<br>
lcd(q,F)+1. This method can also be applied<br>
correspondingly to bit repetitions. Although the<br>
repetition of adjacent bits does not impair the<br>
performance of the error correction code so strongly as<br>
is the case when puncturing adjacent bits, it is<br>
nevertheless advantageous to distribute repeated bits<br>
as uniformly as possible.<br><br>
The fundamental objective of this method is to achieve<br>
a uniform spacing between the punctured bits in the<br>
original sequence, while taking account, however, of<br>
the constraint that the same number of bits are to be<br>
punctured in the various frames. This is achieved by<br>
virtue of the fact that the puncturing distance is<br>
reduced by 1 in specific cases. The method presented is<br>
optimum to the extent that it never reduces the<br>
distance by more than 1 and reduces it only as often as<br>
necessary. This yields the best possible puncturing<br>
pattern subject to the constraints mentioned above.<br>
The following example shows the use of the first set of<br>
parameters, that is to say puncturing with 1:5 (figure<br>
6) . The optimized method obviously not only avoids the<br>
puncturing of adjacent bits, but moreover distributes<br>
punctured bits with the same spacing in the original<br>
sequence. In fact, the same characteristics are<br>
achieved as if the puncturing had been carried out<br>
directly after the coding and before the interleaving.<br>
The aim now is to investigate the next case, that is to<br>
say puncturing with 1: 8 (figure 7). Once again, the<br>
puncturing of adjacent bits is avoided. In this case,<br>
it is impossible to achieve uniformly spaced<br>
puncturing, because then all the bits in an individual<br>
frame would be punctured, which is completely<br>
unacceptable. In this case, most of the distances<br>
between adjacent bits are 7 (only 1 less than in the<br>
case of an optimum distribution). In return, some<br>
distances are greater (every eighth).<br>
The changes are explained below that are applied in<br>
order to improve the method for<br><br>
the case of repetition. The above-described method is<br>
obviously optimum for achieving a uniform distribution.<br>
Surprisingly, however, this method can be further<br>
improved for the case of repetition. This is possible<br>
because certain differences exist between good<br>
repetition patterns and puncturing patterns: in the<br>
case of puncturing, it is particularly damaging to<br>
puncture consecutive bits. Moreover, it should be<br>
avoided that the spacing between consecutive punctured<br>
bits is significantly smaller than the average<br>
puncturing spacing. The reason for this is that<br>
puncturing carried out more intensively or in a shorter<br>
spacing locally increases the bit error rate<br>
disproportionately, and this then impairs the overall<br>
performance.<br>
The repetition of consecutive bits does not lead to a<br>
substantial worsening of the decoding results.<br>
Expressed more generally, the performance is also not<br>
substantially impaired when the spacing between<br>
consecutive repetitions is distinctly smaller than the<br>
mean repetition spacing. However, when the spacing is<br>
locally distinctly higher, the improved decoding option<br>
otherwise rendered possible by repetition is also not<br>
present in this region. This signifies, in turn, a<br>
locally increased bit error rate as in the case of the<br>
abovementioned unfavorable puncturing. It is therefore<br>
advantageous to use a slightly increased repetition<br>
spacing more often than a significantly increased<br>
spacing correspondingly more seldom. In order to fulfil<br>
this optimization criterion, the method set forth above<br>
shall be modified as follows for determining the<br>
displacement of the repetition pattern in the<br>
individual columns:<br><br>
when the average puncturing spacing q is being<br>
calculated, rounding down to the next smaller<br>
whole number is not carried out, but rounding up<br>
to the next greater whole number (if q is not<br>
already itself integral) is.<br>
When q is even, it is not reduced, but increased.<br>
The formula set forth above in the simplified form then<br>
looks as follows with these changes. (corresponding<br>
changes can, of course, also be carried out in the case<br>
of the first-presented form of the formula, or in the<br>
case of any desired other representations, in order to<br>
achieve the desired matching for repetition):<br>
q: = (NC/(/N1-Nc/)])— here, [] signifies rounding up,<br>
and // the absolute value.<br>
-- avoid hitting the same column too early a second<br>
time:<br>
if q is even<br>
then q = q + lcd(q, F)/F<br>
-- here, led (q, F) signifies the greatest common<br>
divisor of q and F<br>
-- the greatest common divisor can easily be<br>
calculated by bit manipulations when F is a power of<br>
two.<br>
-- For the same reason, calculations with p can<br>
easily be carried out by binary fixed-point operations,<br>
(or, alternatively, by integer arithmetic with the use<br>
of displacement operations.<br>
andif<br>
-- calculate S, S signifies the displacement of the<br>
pattern per column.<br><br>
for i = 0 to F-1<br>
S(RF ([i*q] mod F)) = ([i*q] div F) -- here, [ ]<br>
signifies rounding down.<br>
-- Rr(k) is the inversion of the first<br>
interleaver, more precisely the inversion of the column<br>
exchange operation of the first interleaver. This<br>
function is itself inverse for the case of the UMTS<br>
system being developed.<br>
end for<br>
The parameter eoffSet can then be calculated as follows:<br>
eoffset (k) = ((2*S(k) * /Ni-Nc + 1) mod 2Nc<br>
The puncturing/repetition patterns of the individual<br>
columns k are displaced relative to one another by the<br>
amount S(k). If use is made for the calculation of the<br>
bits to be punctured/repeated of what is termed an<br>
error distribution algorithm, this displacement can be<br>
achieved by preloading the initial error value, as<br>
shown above. Of course, other implementations are also<br>
possible for achieving the displacement, in particular<br>
in the case of a use of another puncturing method<br>
inside a column.<br>
There is a further difference between puncturing and<br>
repetition. Even in theory, the puncturing rate can in<br>
no case exceed 100% (meaning that every bit is<br>
punctured). In practice, the decoding performance in<br>
the case of puncturing rates that are higher than<br>
approximately 20% (in special cases, perhaps 50%) is so<br>
strongly impaired that such high puncturing rates are<br>
avoided. However, no such constraints exist for the<br>
repetition rate. A repetition rate of 100% (that is to<br>
say each bit is transmitted twice) is<br><br>
perfectly possible, and even higher repetition rates<br>
are possible- Each bit can be repeated several times.<br>
The more repetitions that are sent, the higher is the<br>
probability of a correct decoding.<br>
A repetition rate of 80% (that is to say 80% of the<br>
bits are transmitted twice and 20% ground only<br>
transmitted once (that is to say not repeated)) can<br>
also be interpreted such that although each bit is<br>
repeated (that is to say transmitted twice), 20% of the<br>
bits (more precisely 20% of the original bits before<br>
the doubling) are punctured. Thus, 20% of the bits are<br>
transmitted with less energy by comparison with the<br>
rest, and thus with a lower reliability. This is very<br>
similar to the case in which 20% of the bits are<br>
punctured.<br>
In both cases, 20% of the bits are transmitted with a<br>
lower reliability by comparison with the rest. However,<br>
the difference in the reliability in the case of<br>
puncturing (no information at all is available via the<br>
punctured bit) is greater than in the case of exclusion<br>
from the repetition, where the quality of the<br>
information via the relevant bit is, after all, still<br>
half as good as for the other bits.<br>
Because of this equivalence of 20% puncturing and 80%<br>
repetition, a puncturing pattern that is optimum for a<br>
puncturing of 20% is also the optimum for a repetition<br>
of 80% if the following substitution is undertaken:<br><br><br>
For the case in which the puncturing is carried out<br>
upstream of the first interleaver, a puncturing method<br>
or repetition method, such as was described above and<br>
is also provided for UMTS in TS25.212, will also<br>
generate equivalent patterns in the two above-named<br>
cases; however, the patterns will be displaced relative<br>
to one another by a constant amount. However, if the<br>
puncturing is not carried out until downstream of the<br>
first interleaver (interframe interleaver), this<br>
requires modification of the method. This is described<br>
for the case of puncturing in the above-named article<br>
R1-99641 (optimized displacement of the puncturing<br>
patterns), or as above (optimized displacement of the<br>
patterns for repetition)<br>
The puncturing or repetition rate can be represented as<br>
r = (Ni-Nc) / Nc<br>
Nc being the number of bits before the rate matching,<br>
and Ni being the number of bits after the rate<br>
matching. We now define an "equivalent" rate for the<br>
case of repetition (that is to say Ni &gt; Nc) as:<br>
re= ((Ni - Nc/2) mod Nc - Nc/2)/Nc<br>
As regards the optimum displacement of the patterns<br>
between the columns, a puncturing rate of 20% is<br>
therefore equivalent to a repetition rate of 80%, 180%,<br>
280% and so on. In exactly the same way, a repetition<br>
rate of 30% is equivalent to a repetition rate of 130%,<br>
230%, 330% and so on.<br>
A further aspect of this invention is the finding that<br>
the relative displacement of the puncturing patterns<br><br>
in the individual columns can also be calculated on the<br>
basis of this effective repetition rate re instead of<br>
the actual repetition rate. Depending on whether re is<br>
greater or less than 0 in this case, it is necessary<br>
for this purpose to use the formula for this<br>
calculation of the displacement for puncturing or<br>
repetition.<br>
As a further exemplary embodiment, the variable q can<br>
also be calculated as the inverse of re:<br>
q = Nc / [ (Ni - Nc/2) mod Nc - Nc/2) .<br>
There are several possibilities for calculating Nc/2 if<br>
Nc is odd. It is possible to round up, round down or<br>
else calculate further with fractional values, that is<br>
to say dispense with rounding. According to this<br>
calculating method, the sign of q carries the<br>
information as to whether puncturing or repetition must<br>
be carried out. Thus, it may be necessary to calculate<br>
the absolute value first before q is substituted in the<br>
appropriate formula.<br>
As a further exemplary embodiment, the formula for<br>
calculating the displacements of the pattern can also<br>
be calculated as follows. This formulation has the<br>
additional advantage that there is no need to make any<br>
distinction between puncturing and repetition, both<br>
cases being covered by the same formula. It is within<br>
the bounds of expert activity to specify further<br>
formulas that define the displacement of the puncturing<br>
patterns while. taking account of the principles<br>
represented above.<br>
q: = [Nc/((Ni-Nc/2) mod Nc - Nc/2) ]<br>
-- here, [ ] signifies rounding up to the next greater<br>
whole number, for example [1.5] = 2 and<br>
[-1.5] = 1.<br><br>
if q Is even - avoid hitting the same column too early<br>
a second time<br>
then q" = q + led (|q|, F)/F<br>
here, led signifies the greatest common<br>
divisor.<br>
-- The greatest common divisor can easily be<br>
calculated by bit manipulations when F is a power of<br>
two.<br>
-- q" is not a whole number, but a multiple of<br>
1/8, or more generally a multiple of F.<br>
-- || signifies the absolute value<br>
else<br>
q" = q<br>
endif<br>
- Calculate S(k), S signifies the displacement of the<br>
pattern per column for the frame k. As shown above, for<br>
the purpose of calculating the initial error value e,<br>
S(k) can in the above-cited rate matching algorithm as<br>
it is described in the UMTS Specification TS25.212.<br>
for i = 0 to F-1<br>
S(RF(/[i*g"]/ mod F)) - ([L*q"] / div F)<br>
-- here, [ ] signifies rounding down.<br>
end for<br>
An equivalent puncturing/repetition rate re is<br>
calculated in the above exemplary embodiment by modulo<br>
operations. Alternatively, modulo operations can also<br>
be used only to take account of multiples of 100% in<br>
the case of the rate, and the decision as to whether<br>
the rate is greater or less than 50% is implemented by<br>
an interrogation. At the same time, it is always<br>
possible to calculate q as a signed variable in order<br>
to preserve the advantage<br><br>
of the previous exemplary embodiment, that is to say<br>
the uniform calculation of puncturing and Repetition.<br>
In order to avoid divisions by 0, it may be necessary<br>
on occasions to treat separately the case in which no<br>
 matching need be carried out. This results in the<br>
following equivalent formulas:<br>
Nc ? Ni,j<br>
Ni - Nc ? delta Ni,j<br>
 S[n] -&gt; S(PlFi(ni)) = S(RF(x))<br>
F ? FI ]<br>
R = (Ni - Nc) mod Nc -- here, x mod Nc is in the range<br>
from 0 to Nc-1, that is to say -1 mod 10 = 9.<br>
-- R is therefore the equivalent repetition rate<br>
 (which lies in the range of 0 to 50%) multiplied by Nc.<br>
if R ? 0 and 2*R ? Nc<br>
If the equivalent repetition rate is less than 50%,<br>
repetition is present, then q &gt; 0.<br>
then q = [NC / R]<br>
 else<br>
otherwise, puncturing is present, then q 
q = [Nc / (R - Nc)]<br>
endif<br>
-- q is a signed variable here.<br>
 if q is even<br>
then q" = q + lcd(|q|, F) / F -- led {|q|, F)<br>
signifying the greatest common divisor of |q| and F.<br>
-- q" is not a whole number but a multiple of 1/8<br>
or of 1/F.<br>
 else<br><br>
q" = q<br>
endif<br>
for k = 0 to F - 1<br>
S(RF (([k*q"]) mod F])) = (|Lk*q"] | div F)<br>
end for<br>
As already mentioned several times, the effect of the<br>
column exchange is taken into account inside the<br>
interleaver in the above-specified formulas. It may be<br>
mentioned for the sake of completeness that the<br>
principles described by these formulas can also be<br>
described by equivalent notations that lead to an<br>
equivalent result.<br>
Figure 1 shows the resulting pattern for the proposed<br>
repetition pattern for a repetition rate of 1:4.<br>
Numbers printed in bold, or numbers at which arrows<br>
begin or end denote bits to be repeated. The arrows<br>
with thin outlines (for example, the arrow from 8 to<br>
12) denote a spacing between adjacent repeated bits of<br>
4, arrows drawn thinly (for example, the arrow from 12<br>
to 17) denote the spacing 5, and the arrow with a thick<br>
outline (for example the arrow from 39 to 40) denotes<br>
the spacing 1.<br>
For the purpose of comparison, figure 8 shows the same<br>
case for the previously applied repetition method, as<br>
presented in R1-99641, for example. The arrows with<br>
thin outlines (for example, the arrow from 8 to 12)<br>
denote a spacing between adjacent repeated bits of 4,<br>
arrows drawn thinly (for example, the arrow from 12 to<br>
15) denote the spacing 3, and the arrow with a thick<br>
outline (for example, the arrow from 33 to 40) denotes<br>
the spacing 7.<br><br>
Comparing the two illustrations shows that the<br>
repetition pattern within the scope of the invention<br>
avoids a relatively large spacing between repeated bits<br>
(7 in figure 8). Since, in particular, the large<br>
spacings between repetitions effect an impairment of<br>
the performance, and since the method according to the<br>
invention avoids such large spacings, the application<br>
of the method according to the invention is<br>
advantageous.<br>
The repetition method according to the invention can<br>
therefore be used to generate virtually optimum<br>
repetition patterns when the rate matching is applied<br>
downstream of the first interleaver. The method is not<br>
particularly complicated in this case, especially as it<br>
need be applied only once per radio frame, and not for<br>
each bit.<br><br>

e) increasing of i by one;<br>
f) repetition of steps e) and f) till i = F-I.<br>
8. Method for data rate matching,<br>
- in which the data to be transmitted is first distributed in the form of bits through<br>
a first interleaver of frames,<br>
- in which for data rate matching after nesting, a repetition process of such a type<br>
is carried out, that in each frame the same number of bits get repeated;<br>
- in which the repetition pattern used within a frame can be shifted and used also<br>
within further frames of the set of frames; and<br>
- in which the shifting S (k) of the application of the repetition pattern to the<br>
frame k, contrary to the application of the repetition pattern of the frame k = 0, is<br>
obtained with the help of the following steps:<br>
a) Calculation of the average repetition distance q according to the following<br>
equation:<br>
q: = ([(/Nc-Nc/)]),<br><br>
whereby [ ] denotes rounding off/ / denotes the absolute magnitude and<br>
whereby Nc denotes the number of bits per column before rate matching and Ni<br>
denotes the number of bits per column after rate matching;<br>
b) calculation of a revised average repetition distance qrevised, if q is even,<br>
according to the following equation:<br>
qrevised = q + led (q, F) /F, whereby F denotes the number of columns and led (q,<br>
F) denotes the highest common factor of q and F;<br>
c) setting of a variable i equals zero;<br>
d) calculation of S (k) according to the following equation:<br>
S (RF (/i *q]Vnod F)) = (/i *q7div F), whereby [ ] denotes rounding off;<br>
e) increasing of i by one;<br>
f) repetition of the steps d) and e) till i = F-l (inclusive).<br>
9. Data rate matching device, particularly a processor unit,<br>
which is installed to conduct the method as per one of the claims 1 to 8.<br>
10. Receiver device,<br>
which is installed in such a way for receiving data resulting from a method for<br>
data rate matching according to one of the claims I to 8, that during the receiver-<br>
side processing, the transmitting-side data rate matching as per one of the claims 1<br>
to 8 is taken into consideration.<br>
Method and apparatus for transmitting data frames, and<br>
a method and apparatus for data rate matching<br>
By means of an interleaver, elements to be transmitted<br>
are distributed over a plurality of radio frames and<br>
repeated, the repetition being carried out in such a<br>
way that, when put into its relationship with the<br>
original arrangement of the elements before the<br>
interleaving, the pattern prevents the spacing between<br>
arbitrary consecutive repeated elements from being<br>
substantially greater than the mean repetition spacing.</td>
