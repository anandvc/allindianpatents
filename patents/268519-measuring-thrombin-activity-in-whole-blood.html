MEASURING THROMBIN ACTIVITY IN WHOLE BLOOD<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method of determining, especially<br>
measuring the time course of thrombin activity in vitro, i.e., measuring<br>
active thrombin in a sample, especially as it develops in a clotting sample<br>
consisting of whole blood. The result of measurement of thrombin activity<br>
can be represented by the so-called "thrombin generation curve" illustrated<br>
in figure 1.<br>
[0002] The invention also relates to means enabling the<br>
measurement of active thrombin following its generation in a sample in<br>
vitro. It is also directed to the use of said method of measurement for the<br>
detection or the monitoring of the condition of a patient, including for<br>
detection or monitoring of a pathological condition related to blood<br>
coagulation deficiency.<br>
[0003] The invention also concerns the use of the method of<br>
measurement for the screening of substances, including for the screening<br>
of drugs which could interact with the coagulation process, especially with<br>
thrombin activity.<br>
[0004] Thrombotic diseases, such as coronary infarction, stroke,<br>
pulmonary embolism and several others are responsible for about half of all<br>
death and disability in western society. In developing countries they<br>
increase with the degree of development. Bleeding disease, although<br>
numerically less important, are also a significant cause of death. Thus over-<br>
or under-function of the haemostatic system is an extremely important<br>
pathogenetic mechanism. It therefore is all the more surprising that a good<br>
clinical function test is not available.<br>
The role of thrombin in haemostatic and thrombotic disease:<br>
[0005] In haemostasis and thrombosis thrombin plays a pivotal role.<br>
In venous thrombotic disease this has long since been recognized (1) and<br>
is convincingly demonstrated by the fact that prevention and treatment of<br>
venous thrombosis is best brought about by decreasing thrombin activity,<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>

either by direct inhibition (hirudin, melagastran) or by decreased synthesis<br>
(vitamin K antagonists) or by increased decay (heparins). In the last<br>
decennia it became increasingly clear that thrombin is as important in<br>
arterial disease as it is in venous disease. Clinical trials have shown that<br>
vitamin K antagonists (2) as well as heparin (3) decrease the reoccurrence<br>
rate of myocardial infarction. A role for thrombin in bleeding is suggested by<br>
the prolonged bleeding time seen when thrombin generation is as<br>
profoundly affected as in severe overdosage of oral anticoagulants (4) or<br>
heparin (5). Also, the haemophilias are diseases of the thrombin forming<br>
system (6).<br>
All elements of the blood participate in thrombin formation:<br>
[0006] Modern research has led to the recognition that thrombin is<br>
formed through the cooperation of the formed elements of the blood and<br>
plasma. Red blood cells (RBCs) are the least active in this respect although<br>
in a small percentage of them the outer membrane exhibits procoagulant<br>
activity (7). Much more important is that white blood cells carry tissue factor<br>
activity. This activity normally is encrypted but in lesion becomes manifest<br>
through interactions with blood platelets (8,9). The main players are<br>
undoubtedly the platelets and the plasmatic clotting system. In textbooks it<br>
is still found that platelets are responsible for primary haemostasis and<br>
arterial thrombosis whereas the clotting of plasma serves for consolidation<br>
of the haemostatic plug and is the mechanism behind venous thrombosis.<br>
This view is due to the fact that plasma and platelets were studied apart<br>
from each other. In reality the cooperation between platelets and plasma<br>
and the other cells of the blood is essential in both primary and secondary<br>
haemostasis and in arterial and venous thrombosis. Platelet plug formation<br>
plays a role in thrombin generation because the interstices in a platelet<br>
aggregate form an unstirred niche in which thrombin can form without being<br>
swept away by flowing blood. That is why measuring thrombin generation in<br>
clotting whole blood is so close to physiological reality.<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
3<br>
[0007] Apart from forming a "sponge" in which thrombin can form,<br>
platelets also actively contribute to the generation of thrombin. They shed<br>
factor V and provide the procoagulant phospholipid surface required for<br>
prothrombin conversion as well as for the different steps in the coagulation<br>
mechanism that lead to prothrombinase formation (10). The velocity of<br>
thrombin generation and the amount formed thus depends upon platelet<br>
activity as well as on the plasma proteins involved. Particularly interesting is<br>
the role of polymerizing fibrin. Von Willebrand factor (vWf) interacts with<br>
polymerizing fibrin and undergoes a conformational change which makes it<br>
reactive to platelet receptor GPIb and through this binding cooperates to<br>
the platelet becoming procoagulant (11,12). This shows that forming a fibrin<br>
clot is not the closing act of haemostatis and that thrombin formation in a<br>
plug (or thrombus, or clot) is a key event in the process. Indeed, as we will<br>
see below, &gt;95% of all the thrombin formed is formed after clotting has<br>
taken place and this thrombin is essential in the haemostasis and<br>
thrombosis (H&amp;T) process. Perhaps the best proof of the tight bonds<br>
between platelets and the plasmatic clotting system is the fact that all<br>
"aggregation inhibitors" and other antiplatelet agents also inhibit thrombin<br>
generation in platelet rich plasma (or whole blood). This has been shown<br>
for aspirin (13), abciximab (14), MK383 (15) and clopidogrel (16). Inversely,<br>
the fact that the antiplatelet drug par excellence, aspirin, prevents venous<br>
thrombosis (17) further illustrates the close connection between platelet<br>
function and blood coagulation.<br>
[0008] So, in summary, the amount of thrombin formed in a clot is an<br>
essential feature in the process of haemostatis and thrombosis and all the<br>
elements of blood take part in its formation.<br>
Thrombin generation (TG) as an indicator of thrombotic- and bleeding risk:<br>
[0009] Increased TG invariably indicates thrombotic risk, whether it is<br>
due to deficiency of antithrombin or an excess of prothrombin. Also in<br>
disorders in the protein C pathway (deficiency of proteins S and C, factor<br>
VLeiden) thrombin generation is higher than normal. This holds for plasma<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
4<br>
clotting as such, but becomes especially obvious if the protein C pathway is<br>
activated by thrombomodulin (fig. 1). The thrombotic tendency induced by<br>
oral contraceptives can be attributed to an acquired resistance to activated<br>
protein C which causes a 10% increase of thrombin generation which<br>
becomes more obvious when TM or APC is added (18,19).<br>
[0010] A particularly interesting case is the lupus anticoagulant. This<br>
type of antibody induces an increase of the lag time of thrombin formation,<br>
and therefore an increase of clotting time, but also an important resistance<br>
to the activity of the protein C system (20). This explains the "LE paradox"<br>
i.e. an anticoagulant effect that is accompanied by a thrombotic tendency.<br>
[0011] Excess amounts of factors II, VIII and VII have been found to<br>
correlate with the occurrence of myocardial infarction (21-24). Also higher<br>
than normal levels of vWF increase thrombin generation (12) are a risk<br>
factor for arterial thrombosis (25,26).<br>
[0012] In a sub-population of young stroke patients (around 30%)<br>
both thrombin generation in Plasma Rich Platelet (PRP) and vWF have<br>
been shown to be significantly higher than normal (27). In all congenital<br>
coagulation factor deficiencies thrombin generation is decreased. This has<br>
been demonstrated for the haemophilias A, B and C (deficiency of factor<br>
VIII, IX or XI; 28-31) as well as for all rare deficiencies (prothrombin, factors<br>
V, VII, X, XII; 32). A bleeding tendency is seen as soon as TG is below 20%<br>
of normal. In haemophilia A not only infusion of factor VIII or administration<br>
of DDAVP augments the capacity of blood to form thrombin but also<br>
inhibitor bypassing therapy with products containing prothrombin and/or<br>
factor VII increases thrombin generation.<br>
[0013] Severe thrombopenia (
thrombin generation as well as the Glanzman and Bernard-Soulier<br>
thrombopathies. In von Willebrand's disease -hitherto known to induce a<br>
disorder of platelet adhesion at high shear rates - thrombin generation in<br>
platelet rich plasma is significantly impaired (see above). The defect in PRP<br>
is much higher than in Plasma Poor Platelet (PPP), which indicates that it<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
5<br>
cannot be explained by the concomitant - usually mild - decrease of factor<br>
VIII.<br>
The Thrombogram<br>
[0014] The following remarks should be taken into consideration with<br>
respect to the mechanism of thrombin generation when addressing the<br>
problem to be solved according to the invention.<br>
[0015] Even a simplified scheme of the mechanism of thrombin<br>
formation (fig.1) shows that it is extremely complex and replete with positive<br>
and negative feedback reactions. Indeed so complex as to become a non-<br>
linear system, i.e., there are no simple relations between the concentration<br>
of the reactants and the outcome and threshold phenomena may cause the<br>
system to react essentially unpredictably. The reaction of the whole to a<br>
given trigger can therefore not be deduced from knowledge of the individual<br>
concentrations of the relevant reactants (that may not even be known) and<br>
only a test that measures the function of the complete system as contained<br>
in the blood of a patient reveals the haemostatic/thrombotic status of that<br>
patient.<br>
[0016] The result of the whole process of thrombin generation is the<br>
appearance and disappearance of a transient thrombin activity. The curve<br>
of thrombin activity against time, or Thrombogram™ (TG) is characterised<br>
by an initiation phase, or lag-time, during which only minute amounts of<br>
thrombin are formed; then follows a burst of activity, known as the<br>
propagation phase (fig.1). Blood forms a clot at the very beginning of the<br>
burst and almost all thrombin is formed after the clot has formed. All formed<br>
thrombin is subsequently inactivated by the antithrombins of the blood.<br>
These proteins bind stoichiometrically to thrombin in a slow reaction. The<br>
inactivation velocity is proportional to the concentration of thrombin and of<br>
antithrombin. As long as the conversion rate of prothrombin is higher than<br>
the inactivation rate of thrombin the level of thrombin increases. As the level<br>
of thrombin increases the inactivation rate also increases. At the peak both<br>
velocities are equal, thereafter decay predominates. The obtained curve of<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
6<br>
thrombin activity shows the various phases and especially shows the peak<br>
of thrombin generation, the time to reach the peak and the endogenous<br>
thrombin potential (ETP).<br>
Prior art<br>
[0017] The necessity to measure the function of the haemostasis and<br>
thrombosis system has not escaped the attention of the medical profession<br>
over the last century. Solutions to this problem have essentially not<br>
changed until the 1990ies, offering means that were either practical but<br>
inadequate or adequate but impractical.<br>
[0018] The practical solutions relate to the measurement of the<br>
clotting time and the bleeding time. The clotting time measures the length of<br>
the initiation phase of thrombin generation and therefore reflects only part<br>
of the function (33, see also above). The sole fact that many varieties of the<br>
test are in use in the clinical laboratory, each useful in a specific situation<br>
only, already shows that a clotting time does not reflect the coagulation<br>
mechanism as a whole. For the bleeding time it can be said that it is<br>
extremely imprecise having a coefficient of variation around 40%, which<br>
strongly limits its practical use (34).<br>
[0019] Since the 1950ies it has been recognized that measuring the<br>
time course of thrombin in clotting blood is the best to estimate H&amp;T<br>
function (35-37). Until 1992 the only way to measure the TG was by taking<br>
samples from clotting blood or plasma and determining the thrombin<br>
content therein. This takes one man-hour per curve and thus can be<br>
suitable for research purposes but not for modern clinical and<br>
epidemiological use.<br>
[0020] In the 1990 Hemker and Beguin et al. (EP-B1- 0 420 332)<br>
launched the idea of adding to the clotting blood a chromogenic (colour<br>
producing) substrate having high specificity for thrombin but a low turnover<br>
rate (low Kcat) and little binding affinity for thrombin (high Km). Such a<br>
substrate remains present during the whole process of TG and the sum (i.e.<br>
the integral) of the thrombin activity over time can be measured from the<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
7<br>
total amount of product formed. Ideally this measures the Endogenous<br>
Thrombin Potential (ETP), i.e. the Area Under the thrombin generation<br>
(AUC).<br>
[0021] Later, Hemker et al. further developed this method to obtain<br>
the whole of the TG curve (38). This was based upon the principle that, if<br>
the kinetic constants of the substrate are favourable, the reaction velocity<br>
can, in good approximation, remain proportional to the thrombin<br>
concentration during the whole of the coagulation process, so that the first<br>
derivative of the product concentration gives a curve that is proportional to<br>
the thrombin activity. This method, described in WO 03/093831A1, was an<br>
extension and elaboration of the procedure earlier disclosed in EP-B2-<br>
0420332, where only the end-level of product is measured, in which way<br>
the area under the curve of the TG, i.e. the ETP is obtained.<br>
[0022] The substrates used in this method yield a yellow product, the<br>
monitoring of which requires measuring optical density and therefore an<br>
optically clear reaction medium. The turbidity caused by the clotting of<br>
fibrinogen has therefore to be avoided and fibrinogen has either to be<br>
removed or its polymerisation has to be prevented by adding polymerisation<br>
inhibitors. Removal of fibrinogen has however the disadvantage of<br>
removing an important reactant and cannot be carried out without removing<br>
cellular elements such as the important blood platelets. Furthermore,<br>
addition of polymerisation inhibitors, at the high concentrations required to<br>
prevent fibrin formation completely, inhibit the prothrombin converting<br>
enzyme and the biochemical reactions leading to its formation.<br>
[0023] In contrast to optical density, fluorescence can be measured<br>
in turbid media. Unlike chromogenic substrates, substrates that yield a<br>
fluorescent product (fluorogenic substates) can therefore be used in plasma<br>
that is not defibrinated and therefore also in Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)<br>
(33,39-43). The use of a fluorogenic substrate introduces two important<br>
disadvantages however: 1) fluorescence intensity is not proportional to the<br>
concentration of the fluorophore because of the so-called inner filter effect;<br><br>
WO 2006/117246	PCT/EP2006/004945<br>
8<br>
2) with the available substates the rate of product formation is not<br>
necessarily proportional to the enzyme concentration. The latter<br>
disadvantage can be overcome by using substrates that are not<br>
significantly consumed, as in the chromogenic method. Such substrates at<br>
the moment are not available. In actual practice at this moment both<br>
problems are solved together by continuous comparison of the<br>
experimental signal to that of a constant thrombin-like activity acting under<br>
exactly identical conditions as those in the measured sample (WO<br>
03/093831 A1).<br>
[0024] The chromogenic method can obviously not be used with<br>
whole blood because blood is not translucent. Fluorogenic substrates have<br>
been reported to be applicable to measure TG in whole blood (44). In actual<br>
practice this published method more often than not yields erratic signals<br>
that do not resemble the course of thrombin generation as it is known from<br>
the established subsampling method (fig.2). Also the quantitative relation<br>
between the signal obtained and the amount of thrombin present varies<br>
from experiment to experiment. In short, the method described does not<br>
yield reproducible and quantifiable results.<br>
[0025] Another possibility is the strong dilution of the blood (10-fold<br>
or more), so that the red blood cells RBC have less influence (45). This<br>
yields curves that are indeed better than those which are obtained<br>
minimally diluted blood. This approach cannot however be thought to<br>
represent the physiological situation for two reasons. In the first place, after<br>
forming a clot (i.e. during the most important phase of thrombin generation),<br>
the thrombin forming reactions are diffusion limited because they take place<br>
at insoluble interfaces (surface of platelets and other cells immobilised in<br>
the fibrin network). This makes them more sensitive to dilution than the<br>
reactions in free solution such as the thrombin inactivation reactions. In<br>
diluted blood the equilibrium between thrombin forming and thrombin<br>
inactivating reactions therefore is not representative for the situation<br>
existing in vivo. This is even more important in the case that pathological<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
9<br>
inhibitors are contained in blood (e.g. in therapy refractive haemophilia or<br>
lupus erythematodes inhibitor). It is well known in clinical practice that<br>
coagulation inhibitors loose their effect upon dilution in vitro.<br>
[0026] Hence the problem remains of how to obtain a signal from<br>
which the changing thrombin concentration can be determined in a sample<br>
of clotting blood that is less than ten times diluted. The present invention<br>
intends to provide a solution to this problem which overcome at least some<br>
of the drawbacks faced in the prior art.<br>
[0027] It was found by the inventors that the irreproducible and<br>
erratic results obtained before the present invention, were at least due to<br>
two causes; a: sedimentation before the blood clots and b: retraction of the<br>
clot after clotting has taken place (see fig.4). It follows therefrom that the<br>
volume from which fluorescence is obtained changes during the reaction<br>
and that the geometric form of the surface changes, causing erratic<br>
focussing and reflection of light that disturbs the signal recovered.<br>
Unexpectedly it was found by the inventors that these phenomena do not<br>
occur when operating on a thin layer of blood and especially on a thin layer<br>
provided with a grid and/or with microbeads. The geometric form of a thin<br>
layer, together or not with said grid and/or microbeads, indeed prevents<br>
sedimentation and retraction. The reaction volume however remains<br>
unknown, hence it has to be determined during the measurement. This is<br>
done by adding, at the start of the experiment, a known concentration of a<br>
fluorescent molecule. The signal is small and thus the signal to noise ratio<br>
is advantageously increased by measuring over a large surface area with<br>
any appropriate device known to the art. Furthermore, as large volume-to-<br>
surface ratios tend to evaporation, suitable measures to prevent this should<br>
advantageously be taken.<br>
[0028] According to the invention, a method is described which is a<br>
method for in vitro determining the course of thrombin activity in time in a<br>
sample wherein the sample is a blood sample and thrombin generation is<br>
measured by the steps of:<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
10<br>
contacting a layer of said sample with a fiuorogenic substrate of<br>
thrombin, wherein said layer has a thickness within a range of<br>
0.05 to 5 mm and a surface within a range of 10 to 500 mm2;<br>
allowing thrombin to generate in said sample;<br>
measuring the fluorescence emitted from the surface of the<br>
layer, by the fluorescent group released from the fiuorogenic<br>
substrate as a result of enzymatic action of generated thrombin<br>
on said fiuorogenic substrate.<br>
[0029] The method of determining thrombin activity enables<br>
measurement of the time course of the concentration of thrombin as it<br>
results from its formation and subsequent inactivation, according to the<br>
coagulation scheme.<br>
[0030] The method of the invention can be carried out on blood<br>
sample such as samples of whole blood or Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)<br>
sample.<br>
[0031] Thrombin is allowed to generate in the sample usually after<br>
the contacting of said sample, with components suitable for initiation of<br>
thrombin generation. Such components can comprise clotting factors such<br>
as tissue factor, and possibly calcium ions.<br>
[0032] While thrombin is generated and present in the reaction<br>
mixture (active thrombin), it reacts with its fiuorogenic substrate, with the<br>
result that the fluorescent group of the substrate is released.<br>
[0033] The reaction is designed in such a way that the fiuorogenic<br>
substrate is present during the whole duration of the reaction, in high<br>
enough amounts to allow measuring thrombin activity. For example, the<br>
substrate concentration is around or above the Km of the substrate for<br>
thrombin, so that the consumption of the substrate has not much influence<br>
on the reaction velocity. The substrate is converted by thrombin, leading to<br>
an increase of the fluorescence emitted from the surface of the assayed<br>
sample.<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
11<br>
[0034] The method defined in the invention, enables thrombin<br>
generation to take place in a blood sample, especially in a whole blood<br>
sample, in a way which is essentially comparable to the thrombin<br>
generation which occurs in the body. It therefore provides a reliable method<br>
of measurement for application in haemostasis and thrombotic studies.<br>
[0035] The step of measuring the increase of the fluorescence<br>
emitted from the surface of the layer of the assayed sample, as a result of<br>
the release of the fluorescent group from the substrate through thrombin<br>
action, is carried out especially using an optical device that both allows to<br>
illuminate large surfaces, such as surfaces having from 10 to 500 mm2 and<br>
that allows to collect the emitted light from that surface. The wavelength<br>
selected for the measurement of the fluorescence is determined by the<br>
selected fluorescent group. One wavelength is determined for the excitation<br>
light which is delivered to the sample to proceed with the measurement.<br>
Another wavelength is determined for the emitted light resulting from the<br>
release of the fluorescent group of the fluorogenic substrate of thrombin. An<br>
optical device, such as a fluorescent plate reader known to persons skilled<br>
in the art (e.g. the Ascent Fluorescent plate reader, Thermolabsystems) is<br>
suitable to measure the fluorescence.<br>
[0036] According to an embodiment of the invention, the sample to<br>
be assayed, especially the whole blood sample, is filled in one or more<br>
containers allowing advantageously to carry out several samples to be<br>
assayed at the same time. Such containers are designed to enable the<br>
sample to be filled in, according to the defined conditions of thickness and<br>
surface of the layer of sample to be analyzed. E.g. flat bottom microplates<br>
containing wells or a container or support having another suitable geometric<br>
design, known by the skilled person in the field of such analysis can be<br>
used.<br>
[0037] Other devices can be used as support for the samples if they<br>
fulfil the requirement of enabling said samples to be provided for the<br>
analysis as a layer complying with the definitions of the invention.<br><br>

PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>

Therefore, the description of the method and means of carrying out the<br>
invention, which is made by reference to wells (of microplates) containing<br>
the samples can apply to other devices (container or support) containing<br>
the samples.<br>
[0038] According to the method of the invention, the concentration of<br>
thrombin during the assay is a function of the measured fluorescence of the<br>
released fluorescent group of the fluorogenic thrombin substrate. It is<br>
especially proportional to the increase rate of the fluorescence appearance.<br>
[0039] Accordingly, the method of the invention enables the<br>
measurement of thrombin concentration during the whole time of thrombin<br>
activity in the sample, provided the fluorogenic substrate is present in<br>
appropriate quantities.<br>
[0040] Therefore, the course of thrombin activity, before and after<br>
clotting of the blood, up to the peak of thrombin and also during decrease of<br>
thrombin concentration after the thrombin peak has been obtained as a<br>
result of thrombin inactivation, is represented by a measurement of the<br>
time-dependent thrombin concentration curve. During the various steps of<br>
thrombin activity, the fluorogenic substrate reacts with the thrombin which is<br>
present and is especially hydrolyzed, resulting in the release of the<br>
fluorescent group.<br>
[0041] A particular advantage of the invention is that the method<br>
enables measurement of thrombin generation in a sample, especially in a<br>
whole blood sample which is not diluted or which is minimally diluted, within<br>
a range of maximum ten times, especially less or equal to 4 times.<br>
[0042] In a particular embodiment of the described method, the<br>
thickness of the layer of sample to be analysed, especially of whole blood is<br>
from 1 to 3 mm, especially about 2 mm or less.<br>
[0043] In a particular embodiment of the method, the surface of the<br>
sample, especially of the whole blood sample, when it is filled in the wells of<br>
the microplate or any appropriate container or support , is larger than 20<br><br>
WO 2006/117246	PCT/EP2006/004945<br>
13<br>
mm2 for example from 30 mm2 to 200 mm2, especially larger than 100<br>
mm2, in particular within a range of 150 to 200 mm2<br>
[0044] As an example, the sample is filled in wells of microplates,<br>
each well having a diameter of 15 mm and the thickness of the blood<br>
sample is less than 2 mm, enabling measurement on a surface of about<br>
175 mm2.<br>
[0045] The measurement of thrombin activity is performed in a way<br>
that enables multiple lecture points of the fluorescence at the surface of<br>
each sample.<br>
[0046] According to an embodiment of the invention, the method is<br>
carried out with a sample, especially a whole blood sample which is filled in<br>
the wells of a plate or other container or support wherein said wells also<br>
contain a grid especially with a mesh size of 50 urn.<br>
[0047] Alternatively or in addition to such grid in an embodiment of<br>
the invention, the sample, especially the whole blood sample, is filled within<br>
a well of a plate or other container or support which contains microbeads.<br>
[0048] The presence of either said grid and/or microbeads is<br>
advantageous to help dispersion of the blood in the well and especially to<br>
prevent retraction of the clot in the clotting blood. In other words, the<br>
presence of the grid or microbeads can prevent disturbances of the surface<br>
of the clotting blood that blur the signal which is measured during thrombin<br>
activity. Such grid and/or microbeads can improve the attenuation of<br>
retraction effects which is obtained by using a large surface for<br>
measurement. Other means enabling said effect can also be used.<br>
[0049] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the wells<br>
containing the sample, especially the whole blood samples are covered to<br>
avoid drying of the blood during time of measurement of thrombin activity,<br>
as a result of evaporation. Such covering can be performed with usual<br>
materials, such as types of thin plastic film, provided they do not interfere<br>
with fluorescence measurement.<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
14<br>
[0050] The measurement of the thrombin activity in the blood sample<br>
is carried out from the time where the sample is filled within the wells (or<br>
any other appropriate device such as a slit) and required components to<br>
initiate thrombin generation are provided to said sample, including tissue<br>
factor, up to the time where thrombin has been consumed in the<br>
coagulation process.<br>
[0051] In a particular embodiment of the method of the invention, the<br>
amount of thrombin fluorogenic substrate added to the sample is within a<br>
range of 50 - 1000 uM. According to the disclosed method, in order to be<br>
able to know the concentration of active thrombin in absolute terms (i.e. in<br>
nM/L), it is necessary to know the volume of the blood sample within which<br>
the measurement of fluorescence is carried out. To this end a known<br>
concentration of a fluorophore can be added to the fluorogenic substrate of<br>
thrombin wherein the respective proportions of thrombin substrate to<br>
fluorophore is in the range of 1% to 10% of the quantity of the fluorescent<br>
molecule bound to thrombin substrate, especially in the range of 1% to 5%.<br>
[0052] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the fluorophore is<br>
of the same nature as the fluorescent molecule which is released by the<br>
action of thrombin upon the fluorogenic substrate.<br>
[0053] In another embodiment this fluorophore is a different species<br>
than the fluorescent molecule of the fluorogenic substrate. In this case, the<br>
measurement of fluorescence takes into account the presence of this new<br>
species of fluorophore; it especially includes the measurement of the<br>
fluorescence of the fluorophore,<br>
[0054] The addition of a known concentration of such a fluorophore<br>
provides an internal standard in the sample to be analysed and allows the<br>
assessment of the volume of the sample wherein fluorescence is actually<br>
measured.<br>
[0055] In order to carry out the method of determining thrombin<br>
generation in a sample especially a whole blood sample, a synthetic<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
15<br>
substrate for thrombin which consists of an organic chemical coupled with<br>
the fluorescent molecule is advantageously used.<br>
[0056] The synthetic fluorogenic substrate can be an oligopeptide<br>
having the sequence of 2 to 30 amino acid residues coupled with a<br>
fluorescent molecule.<br>
[0057] It can be especially useful that the fluorogenic group is bound<br>
to a terminal lysine or arginine residue in the substrate because thrombin<br>
splits preferably groups bound to these amino acid residues.<br>
[0058] According to a particular embodiment, the fluorescent<br>
molecule used is AMC (7-amino-4 methylcoumarin) or p-nitroanilide.<br>
Synthetic substrates have been described by Rijkers, D.T., H.C. Hemker, et<br>
al (1996), Int J Pept Protein Res 48(2): 182-93; Rijkers, D.T., S.J. Wielders,<br>
et al (1995), Thromb Res 79(5-6): 491-9; Wielders, S. M. Mukherjee, et al<br>
(1997), Thromb Haemost 77(4): 629-36.<br>
[0059] A particular synthetic fluorogenic thrombin substrate suitable<br>
to perform the invention is Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC (available from BACHEM).<br>
[0060] In a particular embodiment of the invention, the wells (or any<br>
other appropriate device) containing the sample can further comprise a gel,<br>
possibly a gel containing calcium ions, said gel being prepared so that it<br>
does not enable dilution of the whole blood of the sample. Gel such as<br>
Sefadex or agarose gels can be used to the extent that they are not dried in<br>
such a way that they would allow liquid of plasma to go in to the gel.<br>
[0061] When a gel is used, it can be filled in the wells prior or<br>
together with the whole blood sample.<br>
[0062] The compounds which can be added to the sample in order to<br>
allow thrombin generation comprise tissue factor and calcium ions, which<br>
compounds are added in quantities enabling coagulation to start.<br>
[0063] Such quantities can be within the range of 0.05 picomole/L to<br>
15 nanomole/L for tissue factor, and around 10 mM of Ca++-ions when<br>
citrated blood is used. The invention explicitly also covers the case where<br>
native, non anticoagulated blood is used, in which case no Ca++ needs to be<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
16<br>
added. Alternatively, in certain applications it is profitable not to add tissue<br>
factor in order to investigate the spontaneous coagulability of the blood.<br>
The tissue factor, when needed, is added just before starting the<br>
measurement.<br>
[0064] Calcium ions and/or fluorogenic substrate can be added either<br>
directly with the blood sample especially when calcium and fluorogenic<br>
substrate are used in a solution. Tissue factor can also be added<br>
alternatively to the blood sample.<br>
[0065] When the sample and various compounds are filled into the<br>
well, the measurement is immediately carried out.<br>
[0066] In a particular embodiment of the method of the invention, the<br>
whole blood which is assayed is citrated blood.<br>
[0067] The method of measurement of thrombin activity in the whole<br>
blood sample can be advantageously used for detecting or monitoring a<br>
haemostatic disease or a thrombotic disease or for detecting or monitoring<br>
the possibility that such a disease appears in a patient.<br>
[0068] The method also enables the detection or monitoring the<br>
interaction of determined substance(s) on thrombin activity in a whole blood<br>
sample, wherein said determined substance(s) is (are) added to the sample<br>
to be assayed or is (are) added during thrombin generation.<br>
[0069] Substances that can be tested according to the method are<br>
for instance pharmaceuticals or other compounds having a coagulation<br>
effect on blood, such as coagulation factors or drugs or anticoagulant<br>
factors or drugs. Thrombin inhibitors can especially be tested according to<br>
the method of the invention.<br>
[0070] In another aspect, the method of the invention can be used to<br>
screen substances in order to determine their capacity of interaction with<br>
thrombin activity.<br>
[0071] According to the invention, the method which has been<br>
described above and which will be illustrated in the examples can be<br><br>
WO 2006/117246	PCT/EP2006/004945<br>
17<br>
especially used for measurement of Endogenous Thrombin Potential (ETP)<br>
of the whole blood sample.<br>
[0072] It can be also used for measurement of time to peak for<br>
thrombin or for measurement of clotting time.<br>
[0073] It is also useful to measure the level of the peak of thrombin<br>
generated during the assay.<br>
[0074] The method of the invention indeed allows the measurement<br>
of the so-called thrombin curve which is the first derivative of the measured<br>
fluorescence resulting from the reaction between thrombin and fluorogenic<br>
substrate.<br>
[0075] In a particular method of the invention, a calibration step is<br>
performed such as the calibration described in the patent application WO<br>
03/093831.<br>
[0076] The method of the invention has been described in relation to<br>
the biological sample which is the whole blood sample. It could also be<br>
used to assay a sample which would be Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) or<br>
even Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP).<br>
[0077] The invention also relates to a kit for carrying out the method<br>
disclosed above and in the examples which follow wherein said kit<br>
comprises<br>
-	a fluorogenic substrate for thrombin,<br>
-	tissue factor and calcium ions to enable thrombin generation,<br>
-	optionally, a grid or microbeads that prevent retraction of blood clot<br>
and helps dispersion of the whole blood,<br>
-	optionally a gel possibly comprising Calcium ions.<br>
[0078] Optionally, the kit also comprises directions for use in order to<br>
provide specific guidance to carry out the method of the invention. Other<br>
features of the invention and advantageous thereof will be disclosed in the<br>
examples and in figures which follow.<br><br>

Fig. 10A: Sample cartridge design shows a possible design of ^two-<br>
compartment measurement cartridge. One thin piece of (preferably rigid,<br>
e.g., glass) material (referred to as "slide") possibly coated with a<br>
biocompatible coating, is divided into compartments with a suitable spacer.<br>
This spacer may also act as electrode to detect sample injection by drop of<br>
resistance and/or increase of electric current. Each compartment may be<br>
coated with substances like calibrator and/or substrate (or any other<br>
needed substance like inhibitors and tissue factor). A second slide is<br>
attached on top of the other slide. Space between the two slides is 5-1000<br>
urn, preferably 50 urn.<br>
The cartridge may be coated on one or more sides by a suitable dichroic<br>
mirror coating enabling optical amplification. This allows the excitation light<br>
to enter the cartridge, while emission light is reflected within the cartridge<br>
(see Figure 10B) and will be concentrated to a non-coated side of the<br>
cartridge.<br>

example a porous polymer or cellulose, is put between two slides. This<br>

tissue factor, inhibitors). These substances may be present together with a<br>
solvent, in dried or lyophilized form.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
I MEASURING TG IN WHOLE BLOOD: THE OBSERVED PHENOMENA<br>
AND THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES FOR MEASURING TG.<br>
[0079] When a fluorogenic substrate is used, fluorescence can be<br>
provoked and measured only in so far as light is not intercepted by red<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
20<br>
blood cells, i.e., in the plasma space accessible to the excitation light, which<br>
is also the space from which the emitted light can be observed. For the<br>
sake of simplicity, we assume the red blood cells to be completely<br>
impenetrable to both types of light. If however to a certain extent RBC are<br>
penetrable, the reasoning needs not to be fundamentally altered.<br>
[0080] Whole blood forms a clot at the end of the initiation phase,<br>
i.e., at the beginning of the explosive bulk of thrombin generation. In fig. 4<br>
four stages are depicted of the situation on the upper- and under-surfaces<br>
of blood, clotting in the well of a fluorimeter plate in the presence of a<br>
fluorogenic substrate and illuminated from the top or alternatively the<br>
bottom .<br>
[0081] At stage A the stirred blood has just come to rest and the red<br>
blood cells are dispersed homogeneously in the fluid plasma (fig.4 A). In<br>
the course of the lag time before clotting (typically 3-12 minutes)<br>
sedimentation of the red blood cells takes place; at the top more plasma<br>
becomes accessible to light and less at the bottom (fig.4 B). As soon as<br>
blood clots (fig.4 C) the status quo raised in B is "frozen" by the appearance<br>
of the fibrin clot. Because of the action of thrombin on the blood platelets<br>
clot retraction sets in as soon as a clot is formed. Sedimentation and clot<br>
retraction are phenomena that are visible to the naked eye on a mm-per-<br>
hour scale. In the micrometer domain they occur in the course of minutes,<br>
i.e., in the time scale of the TG experiments. Retraction brings about an<br>
unequal distribution of the RBCs and also a change in the surface, such<br>
that it is no longer plane but becomes undulated. This undulation brings<br>
about an unequal repartition of plasma and clot at the surface and causes<br>
unpredictable optical effects. The surface irregularities are on a mm scale<br>
and visible to the naked eye. They therefore are of the same order of<br>
magnitude as the excitation light spot in normal fluorometry.<br>
[0082] Sedimentation and retraction induce a change of the fluid<br>
volume in which fluorescent molecules can be reached by the excitation<br>
light. Due to this change the actual volume in which the measurement takes<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
21<br>
place is variable and unknown. Hence, reproducible quantification of the<br>
amount of thrombin from the rate of signal production obtained in these<br>
conditions is impossible, even if the effects of sedimentation and retraction<br>
would be negligible.<br>
[0083] Experiments carried out by using ordinary microtiter plate<br>
wells and a volume that filled these wells to normal height (6 mm) allowed<br>
satisfactory results to be obtained only in a small percentage of ail wells.<br>
This is explained by the fact that in ordinary fluorometry a sufficient signal is<br>
obtained only if the spot of surface measured (around 4 mm2) coincides<br>
with an area where sufficient signal can be obtained because sufficient<br>
plasma is available; that is not above a retracted clot-mass but in a "valley"<br>
of the surface (see fig.4 D). The positive reports in the literature of<br>
measurement must result from a careful selection of the data obtained. In<br>
those cases where a signal of the right form is obtained, the quantitative<br>
measurement of thrombin is impossible because the measuring volume is<br>
unknown and variable. Measuring from the bottom through a transparent<br>
foil would solve the problem of surface irregularities but, due to the<br>
sedimentation of RBC, the signal becomes so small that it drowns in the<br>
background noise.<br>
[0084] It has been observed that, with normal filling of the wells of a<br>
96-well plate of the type available to date, it is possible to obtain an<br>
interpretable signal in 1 or 2 out of 10 wells. If the wells are filed to less than<br>
2 mm height as the normally useful height, signal is obtained in near to all<br>
measurements. Nevertheless the signal that is obtained in this manner in a<br>
normal fluorimeter is very variable and small, i.e., corresponds to 1 - 5 % of<br>
the signal obtained with plasma, and shows a large signal to noise ratio<br>
(fig.6). We concluded that there is no practical way to determine TG in<br>
whole blood using the optical setup of a normal fluorimeter.<br>
II THE DESIGN OF THE METHOD OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Principle of the invention<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
22<br>
[0085] Unexpectedly it was found that (a) the effects of<br>
sedimentation and retraction progressively diminish with the thickness of<br>
the layer of clotting blood and, (b) that measuring fluorescence from a<br>
surface larger than around 10 mm2 tends to equal out the remaining<br>
irregularities of the surface brought about by retraction. Equally<br>
unexpectedly, the effects of sedimentation and retraction can be further<br>
reduced by containing the blood in mazes or interstice, such as a filter grid<br>
(having mesh opening 50 - 500 urn) or packed spheres (diameter 50 - 500<br>
urn). Consequently, the inventors provide conditions for obtaining an<br>
undisturbed fluorescent signal from the product of thrombin activity by<br>
enabling measurement to be carried out in a thin layer of blood (especially<br>
inferior to 2mm) spread out over a surface larger than around 10 mm2.<br>
[0086] To solve the problem of the unknown volume in which the<br>
reaction is measured, the inventors further decided not to use pure<br>
substrate but rather substrate that already contained a fixed low, but known<br>
and readily measurable, concentration of fluorescent product.<br>
2.	Optical device for measurement<br>
[0087] Measuring over a larger than normal surface requires optical<br>
devices that allow to illuminate the large surfaces and to collect the emitted<br>
light from that surface. One such device is not unlike a Huygens eyepiece,<br>
another like a microscope condenser (fig. 5). To increase the fluorescent<br>
signal the blood can be spread on a reflecting surface, and such surface<br>
can be an integral part of the device described below.<br>
3.	The device containing the blood sample<br>
[0088] The use of a device that contains the blood in the interstices<br>
of its structure allows simulation of the situation of blood shed in a wound, it<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
23<br>
can be made to contain tissue factor, thrombomodulin and or other<br>
elements known to exist in the normal vessel wall which affect the TG<br>
process (e.g. collagen). For the sake of comparison the material from which<br>
the device is made can be chosen among inert material such as e.g. nylon<br>
or polypropylene.<br>
[0089] To prevent drying out of the surface, the thin layer of blood<br>
can be covered by a thin film of solid or fluid material. Alternatively the<br>
blood can be guided into a slit within a translucent material, e.g. by capillary<br>
force.<br>
4. Measurement<br>
[0090] it is an advantage of measuring in a thin layer that the<br>
fluorescent signal is proportional to the concentration of fluorescent<br>
molecules; in other words, the inner filter effect does not play a role.<br>
Substrate consumption does play a role however. It can be compensated<br>
for in three ways: (a) As in the chromogenic method (38), i.e. by providing<br>
substrates with kinetic constants such that substrate consumption has a<br>
negligible effect, (b) By correcting for substrate consumption<br>
mathematically, i.e. by applying the integrated rate equation and (c) By<br>
using a calibrator as described in patent WO 03/093831.<br>
[0091] The course of thrombin concentration in clotting whole blood<br>
is determined from the enzymatic action of thrombin on a fluorogenic<br>
substrate added to the blood. A stable and sufficient signal has been<br>
obtained by measuring in a thin layer illustrated by a layer of less than 2<br>
mm of thickness over a large surface (illustrated by a surface having more<br>
than 10 mm2). To measure the actual volume in which the reaction takes<br>
place a small amount of fluorophore is added to the substrate. A<br>
specialized optical device is required for illuminating the whole of the<br>
surface and another for collecting the light emitted from the surface.<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
24<br>
[0092] The thin layer could be stabilized and prevented from drying<br>
by a series of mechanical means, among which an inert grid or a grid of<br>
material chosen such as to imitate certain properties of the vessel wall.<br>
Alternatively a small slit can be used.<br>
[0093] The setup can also be used for measuring thrombin<br>
generation in platelet poor and platelet rich plasma.<br>
5. Reaction mixture<br>
Chemicals<br>
[0094] Recombinant relipidated tissue factor (rTF) not containing<br>
polybrene or Ca++ is from Dade Behring (Marburg, Germany). Fluorogenic<br>
substrate, Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC is obtained from Bachem (Switzerland).<br>
Upon splitting by thrombin it releases the fluorescent 7-amino-4-<br>
methylcoumarine (AMC) which is measured by a 390 nm excitation and a<br>
460 nm emission filter set.<br>
[0095] A fresh mixture of fluorogenic substrate and CaCl2 (FluCa) is<br>
prepared for each experiment as follows: to 875 μL of Buffer (Hepes 20<br>
mM, pH 7.35) containing 60 g/L BSA (Sigma, A-7030) 100 μL of 1 M CaCI2<br>
was added. At 37 °C, 25 uL of a 100 mM DMSO-solution of the fluorogenic<br>
substrate was squirted in and immediately vigorously mixed. The resulting<br>
clear solution, referred to as FluCa, thus is 2.5 mM in fluorogenic substrate<br>

Blood and plasma<br>
[0096] Blood is obtained through venapuncture (1 volume tri-sodium<br>
citrate 0.13 M to 9 volumes blood). Free flow or minimal suction should be<br>
employed; vacuum containers are to be avoided.<br><br>

[0097] The measurements are carried out in a plate fluorimeter<br>
(Ascent reader, Thermolabsystems OY, Helsinki Finland) equipped with a<br>
390/460 filter set (excitation/emission). Instead of a normal 96 well plate, a<br>
well plate is used with 24 round wells with a diameter of 15 mm and hence<br>
a surface of 175 mm2.The wells are prepared by washing several times with<br>
buffer A and drying the wells.<br>
[0098] Then the mixture of blood and substrate is added in which<br>
thrombin generation takes place. This mixture contains, per well to be<br>
filled : 80 uL citrated whole blood,<br>
[0099] 20 uL Innovin® 1:1000 diluted in buffer A , 20 pL FluCa or, as<br>
the case be, a multiple of these volumes.<br>
[00100] Immediately after addition of the FluCa, the mixture is stirred<br>
on a Vortex mixer and added to the wells. The plate is inserted into the<br>
fluorimeter and shaken during 10 s. at 1200 rpm and then measured every<br>
two minutes at 390/460 nm 37 °C during an hour.<br>
[00101] To each we!! 120 uL of the mixture is added.<br>
Example 1<br>
Multiple lecture points, adding a mesh and a cover.<br>
[00102] Thrombin generation was triggered as indicated above in<br>
three wells. Per well 24 spots were illuminated and measured one after the<br>
other. The signals from the 24 points at each reading were added. The<br>
results are shown in fig.7. It is seen that the signal is augmented and<br>
stabilized by adding a grid, here a nylon filter with a 600pM mesh opening,<br>
51% open area and a thickness of 445 uM (Spectrum Laboratories Inc.<br>
Rancho Dominguez California, USA). However, the signal spuriously<br>
increases with time due to evaporation and concentration of the top layer.<br>
This is prevented by covering with a plastic foil. (Thermosprint optical clean<br>
sealing tape for QPCR (Bilatec AG, Mannheim, Germany).<br>

Multiple lecture points, adding a gel and a cover.<br>
[00103] Thrombin generation was triggered as indicated above in<br>
three wells. Per well 24 spots were illuminated and measured one after the<br>
other. The signals from the 24 points at each reading were added. To two<br>
wells 700 uL of a 50% (v/v) Spehadex-25 in 150 mM NaCI solution is added<br>
and the powder is allowed to settle for 5 minutes. The supernatant (300 -<br>
400 uL) is removed from the well with a pipette.<br>
[00104] Then 120 μL of the clotting blood mixture is added. On top of<br>
one of these two wells a plastic foil. (Thermosprint optical clean sealing<br>
tape for QPCR (Bilatec AG, Mannheim, Germany) was applied. The results<br>
are comparable to those in fig.7<br>
Example 3<br>
Collecting the light with an optical device<br>
[00105] For this experiment one well, with grid and cover as in<br>
example 1, was measured with the aid of a Fluostar optima fluorimeter<br>
(BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The light from the sample was<br>
collected into a Huygens eyepiece (10x magnification) and read after<br>
passing through this optical device. The results are shown in fig.8<br>
Example 4<br>
From arbitrary units to thrombin<br>
[00106] This experiment was essentially carried out as that in example<br>
1 with mesh and cover but a known amount (10 nM) of AMC was added to<br>
the substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-AMC. Due to sedimentation of the<br>
erythrocytes, the volume in which the measurement takes place increases<br>
so the signal from the AMC present increases. At the moment of<br>
coagulation the situation "freezes" and no further sedimentation takes<br>
place. At that moment, known from a sudden increase in signal, we<br>
measure the amount of fluorescence due to the 10 nM of AMC added. In<br>
this way we know how to convert units of fluorescence (F) in concentration<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/004945<br><br>
27<br>
of AMC. Thus the dF/dt measured can be converted into d[AMC]/dt. From<br>
an independent experiment we know what d[AMC]/dt corresponds to what<br>
thrombin concentration. Thus the velocity of change of the fluorescence<br>
(fig.9, black line) can be converted into concentration of thrombinin the<br>
sample.<br>
Example 5<br>
Device containing the blood sample<br>
A filter paper cell containing substrate and Ca2+-ions is prepared by adding<br>
50 uL of a 100 mM DMSO-solution of the fluorogenic substrate and 100 uL<br>
of a 1 M CaCI2 solution to 5850 uL ethanol. 11 pL of this solution is spread<br>
on a piece of solid matrix (Whatman 1 MM chromatography paper) of 7x9<br>
mm and dried under nitrogen. Next it is covered between to pieces of<br>
plastic (Thermosprint optical clean sealing tape for QPCR, Bilatec AG,<br>
Mannheim, Germany) as shown in Figure 11.<br>
The same procedure is used to prepare a filter paper cell only containing<br>
substrate, in this case, 50 uL of a 100 mM DMSO solution of the fluorogenic<br>
substrate is added to 5950 uL ethanol, of which 11 uL is spread on a piece<br>
of solid matrix and dried under nitrogen.<br>
Multiple lecture points, using a filter paper cell.<br>
Two filter paper cells, one containing fluorogenic substrate and calcium ions<br>
(A) and one only containing substrate (B) were freshly prepared as<br>
described above.<br>
A 4:1:1 mixture of citrated whole blood, buffer B and Innovin® (1:1000<br>
diluted in buffer A) was prepared. As a calibrator, a 4:1:1 mixture of citrated<br><br>
WO 2006/117246<br><br>

28<br>
whole blood, polymerization inhibitor (H-Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-OH • AcOH)<br>
(Bachem feinchemikalien AG, Bubendorf, Switserland) in buffer B (1.0 mM)<br>
and 20 uM staphylocoagulase was prepared by mixing whole blood and<br>
polymerization inhibitor. Just before starting the experiment, the<br>
Staphylocoagulase was added and the sample was mixed well.<br>
Immediately after adding the Staphylocoagulase, the experiment is started<br>
by adding 11 uL of the TG sample to cell A and 11 uL of the calibrator to<br>
cell B. This is done by pipetting the drops close to the solid matrix in a way<br>
that the drop touches the matrix (see Figure 11) and is sucked into it by<br>
capillary forces. Per cell, 4 spots are illuminated and measured one after<br>
the other.<br>
The signal from the calibrator is a straight line, the slope is used to convert<br>
the signal from the sample cell into nM thrombin. This is conventional signal<br>
calibration as known to the art and not continuous calibration in the sense<br>
of patent application PCT/EP 03/04705. Results are shown in Figure 12.<br><br>
