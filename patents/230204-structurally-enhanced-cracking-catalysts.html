CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
 This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. rial<br>
No. 09/661,611, filed September 22, 2000.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalysts comprising microspheres containing Y-<br>
faujasite zeolite and having exceptionally high activity and<br>
other desirable characteristics, methods for making such<br>
catalysts and the use of such catalysts for cracking<br>
petroleum feedstocks, particularly under short residence<br>
time processes.<br>
Since the 1960's, most commercial fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalysts have contained zeolites as an active<br>
component. Such catalysts have taken the form of small<br>
particles, called microspheres, containing both an active<br>
zeolite component and a non-zeolite component. Frequently,<br>
the non-zeolitic component is referred to as the matrix for"<br>
the zeolitic component of the catalyst. The non-zeolitic<br>
component is known to perform a number of important<br>
functions, xelating to both the catalytic and physical<br>
properties of the catalyst.' Oblad described those functions<br>
as follows:<br>
"The matrix is said to act as- a sink for sodium in the<br>
sieve thus adding stability to the zeolite particles in<br>
the matrix catalyst. The matrix serves the additional<br>
function of: diluting the zeolite; stabilizing it<br>
towards heat and steam and mechanical attrition;<br>
providing high porosity so that the zeolite can be used<br><br>
to its maximum capacity and regeneration can be made<br>
easy; and finally it provides the bulk properties that<br>
are important for heat transfer during regeneration and<br>
cracking and heat storage in large-scale catalytic<br>
cracking." [A.G. Oblad Molecular Sieve Cracking<br>
Catalysts, The Oil And Gas Journal, 70, 84 (March 27,<br>
1972) .]<br>
In prior art fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, the<br>
active zeolitic component is incorporated into the<br>
microspheres of the catalyst by one of.two general<br>
techniques. (In one technique the zeolitic component is<br>
crystallized .and then incorporated into microspheres in a<br>
separate step. In the Second technique, the in-situ<br>
technique, microspheres are first formed and the zeolitic<br>
component is then crystallized in the microspheres<br>
themselves to provide microspheres containing both zeolitic<br>
and non-zeolitic components.<br>
It has long been recognized that for a fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalyst to be commercially successful, it 'must<br>
have commercially acceptable activity, selectivity, and<br>
stability characteristics. It must be sufficiently active<br>
to give economically attractive yields, it must have good<br>
selectivity towards producing products that are desired and<br>
not producing products that.are not desired, and it must be .<br>
sufficiently hydrothermally stable and attrition resistant<br>
to have a commercially useful life.<br>
Two products that are particularly undesirable in<br>
commercial catalytic cracking processes are coke and<br>
hydrogen. Even small increases in the yields of these<br>
products relative to the yield of gasoline can cause<br>
significant practical problems. For example, increases in<br>
the amount of coke produced can cause undesirable increases<br><br>
in the heat that is generated by.burning off the coke during<br>
the highly exothermic regeneration of the catalyst.<br>
Conversely, insufficient coke production can also distort<br>
the heat balance of the cracking process. In addition, in<br>
commercial refineries, expensive compressors are used to<br>
handle high volume gases, such as hydrogen. Increases in<br>
the volume of hydrogen produced, therefore, can add<br>
substantially to the capital expense of the refinery.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,493,902, the teachings of which are<br>
incorporated herein by cross-reference, discloses novel<br>
fluid cracking catalysts comprising attrition-resistant,<br>
high zeolitic content, catalytically active microspheres<br>
containing more than about 40%, preferably 50-70% by weight<br>
Y faujasite and methods for making such catalysts by<br>
crystallizing more than about 40% sodium Y zeolite in porous<br>
microspheres composed of a mixture of two different forms of<br>
chemically reactive calcined clay, namely, metakaolin<br>
(kaolin calcined to undergo a strong endothermic reaction<br>
associated with dehydroxylation) and kaolin clay calcined<br>
under conditions more severe than those used to convert<br>
kaolin to metakaolin, i.e., kaolin clay calcined to undergo<br>
the characteristic kaolin exothermic reaction, sometimes<br>
referred to as the spinel form of calcined kaolin. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the microspheres containing the two<br>
forms of calcined kaolin clay are immersed in an alkaline<br>
sodium silicate solution, which is heated, preferably until<br>
the maximum obtainable amount of Y faujasite is crystallized<br>
in the microspheres.<br>
In practice of the '902 technology, the porous<br>
microspheres in which the zeolite is crystallized are<br>
preferably prepared by forming an aqueous slurry of powdered<br>
raw' (hydrated) kaolin clay (Al2O3:2SiO2:2H2O) and powdered<br><br>
calcined kaolin clay that has undergone the exotherm<br>
together with a minor amount of sodium silicate which acts<br>
as fluidizing agent for the slurry that is charged to a<br>
spray dryer to form microspheres and then functions to<br>
provide physical' integrity to the components of the spray<br>
dried microspheres. The spray dried microspheres containing<br>
a mixture of hydrated kaolin clay and kaolin calcined to<br>
undergo the exotherm are then calcined under controlled<br>
conditions, less severe than those required to cause kaolin<br>
to undergo the exotherm, in order to dehydrate the hydrated<br>
kaolin clay portion of the microspheres and to effect its<br>
conversion into metakaolin, this resulting in microspheres<br>
containing the desired mixture of metakaolin, kaolin<br>
calcined to undergo the exotherm and sodium silicate binder.<br>
In illustrative examples of the '902 patent, about equal<br>
weights of hydrated clay and spinel are present in the spray<br>
dryer feed and the resulting calcined microspheres contain<br>
somewhat more clay that has undergone the exotherm than<br>
metakaolin. The '902 patent teaches that the calcined<br>
microspheres comprise about 30-60% by weight metakaolin and<br>
about 40-70% by weight kaolin characterized through its<br>
characteristic exotherm. A less preferred method described<br>
in the patent, involves spray drying a slurry containing a<br>
mixture of kaolin clay previously calcined to metakaolin<br>
condition and kaolin calcined to undergo the exotherm but<br>
without including any hydrated kaolin in the slurry, thus<br>
providing microspheres containing both metakaolin and kaolin<br>
calcined to undergo the exotherm directly, without calcining<br>
to convert hydrated kaolin to metakaolin.<br>
In carrying out the invention described in the '902<br>
patent,, the microspheres composed of kaolin calcined to<br>
undergo the exotherm and metakaolin are reacted with a<br><br>
caustic enriched sodium silicate solution in the presence of<br>
a crystallization initiator (seeds) to convert silica and-<br>
alumina in the microspheres into synthetic sodium faujasite<br>
(zeolite Y) . The microspheres are separated from the sodium<br>
silicate mother liquor, ion-exchanged with rare earth,<br>
ammonium ions or both to form rare earth or various known<br>
stabilized forms of catalysts. The technology of the '902<br>
patent provides means for achieving a desirable and unique<br>
combination of high zeolite content associated with high<br>
activity, good selectivity and thermal stability, as well as<br>
attrition-resistance.<br>
The aforementioned technology has met widespread<br>
commercial success. Because of the availability of high<br>
zeolite content microspheres which are also attrition-<br>
resistant, custom designed catalysts are now available to<br>
oil refineries with specific performance goals, such as<br>
improved activity and/or selectivity without incurring<br>
costly mechanical redesigns. A significant portion of the<br>
FCC catalysts presently supplied to domestic and foreign oil<br>
' refiners is based on this technology. Refineries whose FCC<br>
units are limited by the maximum tolerable regenerator<br>
temperature or by air blower capacity seek selectivity<br>
improvements resulting in reductions in coke make while the<br>
gas compressor limitations make catalysts that reduce gas<br>
make highly desirable. Seemingly a small reduction in coke<br>
can represent a significant economic benefit to the<br>
operation of an FCC unit with air blower or regenerator<br>
temperature limitations.<br>
Improvements in cracking activity and gasoline<br>
selectivity of cracking catalysts do not necessarily go hand<br>
in hand. Thus, a cracking catalyst can have outstandingly<br>
high cracking activity, but if the activity results in a<br><br>
high level of conversion to coke and/or gas at the expense<br>
of gasoline the catalyst will have limited utility.<br>
Catalytic cracking activity in present day FCC catalysts is<br>
attributable to both the zeolite and non-zeolite (e.g.,<br>
matrix) components. Zeolite cracking tends to be gasoline.<br>
selective. Matrix cracking tends to be less gasoline<br>
selective. After appropriate ion-exchange treatments with<br>
rare earth cations, high zeolite content microspheres<br>
produced by the in situ procedure described in the '902<br>
patent are both highly active and highly gasoline selective.<br>
As zeolite content of these unblended microspheres is<br>
increased, both activity and selectivity tend to increase.<br>
This may be explained by the decrease in matrix content with-<br>
increase in zeolite content and the decreasingly prominent<br>
role of nonselective matrix cracking. Thus, increases in<br>
the zeolite content of the high zeolite content microspheres<br>
have been reported to be highly desirable.<br>
The activity and selectivity characteristics of the<br>
catalysts formed by the process of the '902 patent are<br>
achieved even though, in general, the catalysts have<br>
relatively low total porosity as composed to fluid catalytic<br>
cracking catalysts prepared by incorporating the zeolite<br>
content into a matrix. In particular, the microspheres of<br>
such catalysts, in some cases, have a total porosity of less<br>
than about 0.15 cc/g. or even less than about 0 .10 cc/g. In<br>
general, the microspheres of the '902 patent have a total<br>
porosity of less than 0.30 cc/g, ' As used herein, "total<br>
porosity" means the volume of pores having diameters in the<br>
range of 35-20,000A , as determined by the mercury<br>
porosimetry technique. The '902 patent noted that" it was<br>
surprising that microspheres having a total porosity of less<br>
than about 0.15 cc/g.. exhibit the activity and selectivity<br><br>
characteristics found. For example, such a result is<br>
contrary to the prior art disclosures that low pore volumes<br>
"can lead to selectivity losses due to diffusional<br>
restrictions."<br>
It is believed that the relatively low porosity of the<br>
catalyst microspheres formed as in the '902 patent does not<br>
adversely effect activity and selectivity characteristics,<br>
since the microspheres of the '902 patent are not diffusion<br>
limited relative to the typical FCC processing conditions<br>
which were used at the time of the patent. In particular,<br>
catalyst contact time with•the feed to be cracked was<br>
typically 5 seconds or more. Thus, while typical FCC<br>
catalysts formed by mechanically incorporating the zeolite<br>
within a matrix may have been more porous, the reaction time<br>
in prior art FCC risers did not yield any advantage in<br>
activity or selectivity. This result inspired the<br>
conclusion that transport processes were not at all limiting<br>
in FCC catalysts, at least' outside the zeolite structure.<br>
Assertions made to the contrary were inconsistent with the<br>
facts and easily dismissed as self-serving. Importantly,<br>
the attrition resistance of the microspheres prepared in<br>
accordance with the '902 patent was superior to the<br>
conventional FCC catalysts in which the crystallized zeolite<br>
catalytic component was physically incorporated into the<br>
non-zeolitic matrix.<br>
Recently, however, FCC apparatus have been developed<br>
which drastically reduce the contact time between the<br>
catalyst and the feed which is to be cracked.<br>
Conventionally, the reactor is a riser in which the catalyst,<br>
and hydrocarbon feed enter at the bottom of the riser and<br>
are transported through the riser. The hot catalyst effects<br>
cracking of the hydrocarbon during the passage through the<br><br>
riser and upon discharge from the riser, the cracked<br>
products are separated from the catalyst. The catalyst is<br>
then delivered to a regenerator where the coke is removed,<br>
thereby cleaning the catalyst and at the same time providing<br>
the necessary heat for the catalyst in the riser reactor.<br>
The newer riser reactors operate at lower residence time and<br>
higher operating temperatures to minimize coke selectivity<br>
and delta coke. Several of the designs do not even employ a<br>
riser, further reducing contact time to below one second.<br>
Gasoline and dry gas selectivity can improve as a result of<br>
the hardware changes. These FCC unit modifications are<br>
marketed as valuable independent of the type of catalyst<br>
purchased, implying an absence of systematic problems in<br>
state of the art catalyst technology.<br>
The processing of increasingly heavier feeds in FCC<br>
type processes and the tendency of such feeds to elevate<br>
coke production and yield undesirable products have also led<br>
to new methods of contacting the feeds with catalyst. The<br>
methods of contacting FCC catalyst for very short contact<br>
periods have been of particular interest. Thus, short<br>
contact' times of less than 3 seconds in the riser, and ultra<br>
short contact times of 1 second or less have shown<br>
improvements in selectivity to gasoline while decreasing<br>
coke and dry gas production.<br>
To compensate for the continuing decline in catalyst to<br>
oil contact time in FCC processing, the •"equilibrium"<br>
catalysts in use have tended to become more active. Thus,<br>
increases in the total surface area of the catalyst need to<br>
be achieved and as well, the level of rare earth oxide<br>
promoters added to the catalysts are increasing. Moreover,<br>
cracking temperatures are rising to compensate for the<br>
reduction, in conversion. Unfortunately, it has been found<br><br>
that the .API gravity Of the bottoms formed during short<br>
contact time (SCT) often increases after a unit revamp,<br>
leading some to suggest that the heaviest portion of the<br>
hydrocarbon feed takes longer to crack. Further, while a<br>
high total surface area of the catalyst is valued, the FCC<br>
process still values attrition resistance. Accordingly,<br>
while not obvious to those participating in the art, it has<br>
become increasingly likely that an optimization of FCC<br>
catalysts for the new short contact time.and ultra short<br>
contact time processing which is presently being used is<br>
needed.<br>
It is now theorized, that under the short contact time<br>
processing of hydrocarbons, that further improvements can be<br>
gained by eliminating diffusion limitations that may still<br>
exist in current catalysts. This is being concluded even as<br>
these materials excel at the application. It is- theorized<br>
that improvements in these catalysts may be produced by<br>
optimization of catalyst porosity and the elimination of<br>
active site occlusion and diffusional restrictions of the<br>
binder phases present in catalysts prepared by the so-called<br>
incorporation method.<br>
While the present assignee has produced zeolite<br>
microspheres with increased zeolite content and increased<br>
activity by increasing the macroporosity of the spray dried<br>
microsphere zeolite precursors, the porosity of the formed<br>
zeolite microsphere catalysts has not before been considered<br>
a problem since there has been found no diffusion limitation<br>
under the previous FCC processing techniques. For example,<br>
commonly assigned, U.S. Patent No..4,965,233, to Speronello<br>
discloses increasing the zeolite content of an in-situ<br>
catalyst by forming highly porous precursor microspheres,<br>
which allow increased amounts of zeolite to grow within the<br><br>
porous matrix. The highly porous precursor microspheres are<br>
formed by spray drying a slurry of hydrous kaolin clay,<br>
which is characterized by the presence of a major amount of •<br>
large (greater than 2 microns) kaolin stacks along with<br>
spinel calcined clay. When spray dried, the coarse hydrous<br>
• kaolin results in microspheres having a desired high content<br>
of macropores in which' the zeolite Y can grow. Likewise,<br>
commonly assigned, U.S. Patent No. 5,023,220, to Dight, et<br>
al. also increases the macroporosity of the precursor<br>
microspheres by spray drying a mixture of hydrous clay,<br>
metakaolin and spinel. These catalyst microspheres have a<br>
substantial level of zeolite and are very active and<br>
selective. Further, the high alumina, silica-alumina-matrix<br>
portion of the catalysts is often totally surrounded by the<br>
zeolite formed in-situ such that the matrix is only now<br>
understood to provide a reduced level of bottoms cracking<br>
under the short contact time FCC conditions.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide<br>
a catalyst and a method for reproducibly preparing the same,<br>
wherein the catalyst is an attrition resistant, highly<br>
porous catalyst with a zeolite-coated matrix morphology.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a<br>
catalyst and a method of making same, wherein the catalyst<br>
is provided with improved sodium -removal characteristics,<br>
such that low sodium values are readily and consistently<br>
achieved.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a<br>
catalyst optimized for short contact time FCC, particularly<br>
one that maximizes bottoms cracking and minimizes slurry<br>
gravity to levels at least as low as before an SCT revamp,<br>
without a dry gas penalty.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a<br>
catalyst optimized for short contact time FCC, particularly-<br>
one that allows the user to realize the full coke<br>
selectivity reduction benefits of SCT hardware.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a<br>
«<br>
catalyst optimized for short contact time FCC, particularly<br>
one that maximizes gasoline yields.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with this invention, novel zeolite<br>
microspheres are formed which are macroporous, have<br>
sufficient levels of zeolite to be very active and are of a<br>
unique morphology to achieve effective conversion of<br>
hydrocarbons to cracked gasoline products with improved<br>
bottoms cracking under SCT FCC processing. The novel<br>
zeolite microspheres of the invention are produced by novel<br>
processing, which is a modification of technology described<br>
in U.S. Patent' No. 4,493,902. It has been found that if the<br>
non- zeolite, alumina-rich matrix of'the catalyst is derived<br>
from an ultrafine hydrous kaolin source having a particulate<br>
size such that 90 wt. % of the hydrous kaolin particles are<br>
less than 2 microns, and which is pulverized and calcined<br>
through the exotherm, a macroporous zeolite microsphere can<br>
be produced. More generally, the FCC catalyst matrix useful,<br>
in. this invention to achieve FCC catalyst macroporosity is<br>
derived from alumina sources, such as kaolin calcined<br>
through the exotherm, that have a specified water pore<br>
volume, which distinguishes over prior art calcined kaolin<br>
used to. form the catalyst matrix. The water pore volume is<br>
derived from an Incipient Slurry Point (ISP) test, which is<br>
described below.<br><br>
• The morphology of the microsphere catalysts which are<br>
formed is unique relative to the in-situ microsphere<br>
catalysts formed previously. Use of a pulverized, ultrafine<br>
hydrous kaolin calcined through the exotherm yields in-situ<br>
zeolite microspheres having a macroporous structure in which<br>
the macropores of the structure are essentially coated or<br>
lined with zeolite subsequent to crystallization.<br>
Macroporosity as defined herein means the catalyst has a<br>
macropore volume in the pore range of 600 - 20,000 A of at<br>
least 0.07 cc/gm mercury intrusion. The catalysts of this<br>
invention should also have a BET surface area less than 500<br>
m2/g. The novel catalyst of this invention is optimal for<br>
FCC processing, including the short contact time processing •<br>
in which the hydrocarbon feed is contacted with a catalyst<br>
for times of about 3 seconds or less.<br>
In the broadest sense, the invention is not restricted<br>
to macroporous catalysts having a non-zeolite matrix derived<br>
solely from kaolin. Thus, any alumina source which has the<br>
proper combinations of porosity and reactivity during<br>
zeolite synthesis and can generate the desired catalyst<br>
macroporosity and morphology can be used. The desired<br>
morphology comprises a matrix which is well dispersed<br>
throughout the catalyst, and the macropore walls of matrix<br>
are lined with zeolite and are substantially free of binder .<br>
coatings. Accordingly, not only is the large pore surface<br>
area of the catalyst vastly improved. over previous<br>
catalysts, and the active matrix dispersed throughout the<br>
microsphere, the zeolite crystals are readily accessible to<br>
the hydrocarbon feed. While not wishing to be bound by any<br>
theory of operation, it appears that previous catalysts in<br>
which the zeolite is incorporated into a matrix by physical<br>
mixing and glued with binder have sufficient macroporosity,<br><br>
however the binder coats the active zeolite catalyst thereby-<br>
blocking accessibility thereto. The present microsphere<br>
catalysts have a morphology which allows fast diffusion into .<br>
the catalyst due to the macroporosity and enhanced<br>
dispersion of the matrix, and further provides'the highest<br>
accessibility to the zeolite inasmuch as the zeolite is<br>
freely coated onto the walls of the pores. The term<br>
"freely" means that the zeolite phase is present on the<br>
surface of the matrix and is unobstructed by any binder<br>
phases. Merely having macroporosity does not provide the<br>
results we have obtained, since conventional incorporated<br>
catalysts have .similar macroporosity. It is therefore the<br>
combination of porosity and zeolite-coated macropore walls<br>
that give the surprising selectivity results.<br>
One would not have anticipated that contacting a heavy<br>
hydrocarbon feed, whose molecules are frequently if not<br>
generally too large to enter zeolite pores, with zeolite<br>
prior to feed contact with the matrix would be optimal, as<br>
has been found. Indeed, the prevailing "staged cracking"<br>
theory suggests the opposite, that the larger hydrocarbon<br>
molecules are first cracked on the active matrix and the<br>
formed smaller molecules subsequently cracked within the<br>
zeolite. Much research and promotional activity has been<br>
done in pursuit or support of this perceived ,i deal.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The catalyst microspheres of this invention are<br>
produced by the general process' as disclosed in commonly<br>
assigned U.S. Patent No. 4,493,902. Importantly, the non-<br>
zeolitic, alumina-rich matrix of the catalysts of the<br>
present invention is preferably derived from a hydrous<br>
kaolin source that is. in the form of an ultrafine powder in<br>
which at least 90 wt. % of the particles are less than 2.0<br>
microns, preferably at least 90 wt. % less than 1 micron.<br>
The ultrafine hydrous kaolin is pulverized and calcined<br>
through the exotherm. Typical zeolite microspheres have<br>
been formed with an alumina-rich matrix derived from kaolin<br>
having a larger size than used in this invention and which<br>
is calcined at least substantially through its<br>
characteristic exotherm. Satintone® No. 1, (a commercially<br>
available kaolin that has been calcined' through its<br>
characteristic exotherm without any substantial formation of<br>
mullite) is a material used initially on a commercial basis<br>
to form the alumina-rich matrix. Satintone® No. 1 is<br>
derived from a hydrous kaolin in which 70% of the particles<br>
are less than 2 microns. Other, sources used to form the<br>
alumina-rich matrix include finely divided hydrous kaolin<br>
(e.g., ASP® 600, a commercially available hydrous kaolin<br>
described in Engelhard Technical Bulletin No. TI-1004,<br>
entitled "Aluminum Silicate Pigments" (EC-1167)) calcined at<br>
least substantially through its characteristic exotherm.<br>
Booklet day has found the most widespread commercial use<br>
and has met tremendous success worldwide. Before the<br><br>
present invention, these larger clay particles represented<br>
the state of the art in forming the alumina-rich matrix of<br>
the catalyst microsphere and had no perceived deficits.<br>
While the procedure for forming an in-situ zeolite<br>
microspheroidal catalyst as described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,493,902, is essentially followed, the alumina-rich matrix,<br>
however, is derived from an ultrafine hydrous kaolin. What<br>
is meant by "ultrafine" powder is that at least 90 wt. % of<br>
the hydrous kaolin particles must be less than 2 microns in<br>
diameter, preferably less than 1 micron determined by<br>
Sedigraph™(or sedimentation). It has been found that, in<br>
particular, use of hydrous kaolin pigments with this<br>
particle size distribution upon pulverization and<br>
calcination through the characteristic exotherm results in a<br>
greater quantity of macroporosity even in the catalyst<br>
microsphere subsequent to zeolite crystallization. The<br>
loose packing of the calcined ultrafine kaolin, which has<br>
been found, can be likened to a "house of cards" in which<br>
the individual particulates are aligned randomly with<br>
respect to adjacent particles in a non-parallel manner.<br>
Moreover, the calcined ultrafine kaolin exists as porous<br>
aggregates of the "house of cards" morphology, providing not<br>
only a porous aggregate but additional porous areas between<br>
aggregates. Pulverization of the ultrafine hydrous kaolin<br>
is required to provide the random stacking of the individual<br>
kaolin platelets.<br>
Kaolin clays or pigments are naturally-occurring<br>
hydrated -aluminum silicates of the approximate formula<br>
Al2O3.2siO2.XH2O, wherein X is usually 2. Kaolinite,<br>
nacrite, dickite and halloysite are species of minerals in<br>
the kaolin group. It is well-known that when kaolin is'<br><br>
heated in air, that a first transition occurs at about 550°<br>
C. associated with an endothermic dehydroxylation reaction.<br>
The.resulting material is generally referred.to as<br>
metakaolin. Metakaolin persists until the material is<br>
heated to about 975° C. and begins to undergo an exothermic<br>
reaction. This material is frequently described as kaolin,<br>
which has undergone the characteristic exothermic reaction.<br>
Some authorities refer to this material as a defect<br>
aluminum-silicon spinel or as a gamma alumina phase. See<br>
Donald-W. Breck, Zeolite Molecular Sieves, published by John<br>
Wiley and Sons, 1974, pp. 314-315. On further heating to<br>
about 1,050° C, high temperature phases including mullite<br>
begin to form. The extent of conversion to mullite is<br>
dependent on a time-temperature relationship and the<br>
presence of mineralizers, as is well-known in the art.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of this invention, the<br>
pulverized ultrafine hydrous kaolin used to derive the<br>
alumina-rich matrix is calcined through its characteristic<br>
exotherm with or without-the formation of mullite. An<br>
especially preferred matrix source which is used in this<br>
invention to form the macroporous zeolite microspheres is<br>
Ansilex® 93. Ansilex® 93 is made from the fine size<br>
fraction of a hard kaolin crude, by spray drying,<br>
pulverizing and calcining to prepare low abrasion pigments<br>
as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,586,523, to Fanselow, et.<br>
al., the entire contents of which are herein incorporated by<br>
reference. The ultrafine hydrous matrix source is spray<br>
dried, pulverized and then calcined through the exotherm,<br>
optionally to mullite. The aforementioned U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,493,902 discloses calcining the kaolin clay to mullite<br>
until the X-ray diffraction intensities are comparable to a<br>
fully crystalline reference standard. While it is within<br><br>
the scope of the present invention to calcine the kaolin<br>
beyond the exotherm such that the X-ray diffraction<br>
intensities are comparable to a fully crystalline referenced.<br>
standard as disclosed in the '902 patent, it is preferred to.<br>
calcine the kaolin beyond the characteristic exotherm so as<br>
to convert the kaolin to small crystallite size mullite.<br>
The small crystallite size mullite has the appropriate<br>
diffractional lines and leached chemical composition of a<br>
fully crystalline mullite standard, but the diffractional<br>
lines are weaker inasmuch as the crystallites are smaller.<br>
The relationship between diffraction intensity/line width<br>
and crystallite size is well-known. It is preferred to<br>
calcine the kaolin beyond the exotherm to a small<br>
crystallite mullite matrix inasmuch as fully calcining the<br>
kaolin to mullite takes excessive time and temperature in<br>
practice. Furthermore, calcining kaolin beyond the exotherm<br>
to fully crystalline mullite can.result in the macroporosity<br>
being lost due to sintering. Moreover, the ISP and bulk<br>
density after calcining kaolin to fully crystalline mullite<br>
can be substantially increased. Thus, it is preferred that<br>
the ultra fine kaolin calcined through the exotherm has 20-<br>
80% of the integrated X-ray diffraction peak areas of a<br>
kaolin reference sample containing well crystallized '<br>
mullite. More preferably, the ultrafine kaolin is calcined<br>
through the exotherm such that it has 50-70% of the<br>
integrated X-ray diffraction peak areas of fully<br>
crystallized mullite.<br>
What is unusual about the use of the Ansilex® material<br>
is that it is derived from hard kaolin clay. Hard kaolin<br>
clays typically have a gray tinge or coloration and are,<br>
thus, also referred to as "gray clays". These hard kaolins<br>
are further characterized by breaking into irregularly<br><br>
shaped fragments having rough surfaces. Hard kaolin clays<br>
also contain a significant iron content, typically about 0.6<br>
to 1 wt. % of Fe2O3. Hard kaolin clays are described in<br>
Grim's "Applied Clay Mineralo1ogy", 1962, MaGraw Hill Book<br>
Company, pp. 394-398 thereof, the disclosure of which, is<br>
incorporated by reference herein. The use of these<br>
materials to form the aluminarrich matrix for in situ FCC<br>
microsphere catalysts has not been known previous to this<br>
invention, although their use in the incorporated routes is •<br>
well established. Hard kaolin clays have also occasionally<br>
been-used as sources of metakaolin for in situ microspheres,<br>
but not with advantage. Without wishing to be bound by any<br>
theory, it would' appear that previous use of the calcined<br>
gray clays in the in situ matrix art would be precluded by<br>
(a) the high iron content thereof and the possibility that<br>
this could lead to coke and gas production, and (b) the<br>
dilatant nature of slurries formed therefrom, leading to<br>
apparently senseless waste of process time and increased<br>
cost in making down high viscosity slurries which spray dry<br>
at low solids. We now believe these dilatancy problems and<br>
porosity benefits are intrinsically and fundamentally<br>
linked. As for the former point, reduced coke and gas was an<br>
especially sought-after object for in situ catalysts, since<br>
the original formulations of Haden made coke and gas<br>
commensurate with their extraordinarily high level of<br>
amorphous matrix activity. This led to. lower and lower<br>
levels of iron and spinel in subsequent inventions. We have<br>
made the surprising finding that there appears to be no<br>
relationship between the iron and coke and gas selectivities<br>
after all.<br>
The alumina-rich matrix can be derived from alumina-<br>
containing materials more generally characterized by the<br><br>
porosity thereof provided during the packing of the calcined<br>
material. A test has been developed to determine the pore<br>
volume of the calcined alumina-containing material which<br>
ultimately forms the matrix of the inventive catalyst. The<br>
test characterizes the water pore volume of the calcined<br>
alumina-containing material by determining the minimum<br>
amount of water needed to make a slurry from a sample of the.<br>
solids. In the test, a powder sample is mixed with water<br>
containing a dispersant such as, for example, Colloid 211,<br>
Viking Industries, Atlanta, GA, in a cup using a stirring<br>
rod or spatula. Just enough water is added to the dry<br>
sample to convert the dry powder to a single mass of<br>
dilatant mud which only just begins to flow under its own<br>
weight. The incipient slurry point (ISP) is calculated from<br>
the weights of the sample and water used. The incipient<br>
slurry point can be calculated as follows: ISP = [(grams of<br>
dry sample)/(grams of dry sample plus grams of water added)]<br>
x 100. The units are dimensionless and are reported as<br>
percent solids.<br>
This amount of water is larger than the (internal)<br>
water pore volume of the sample, but is clearly related to<br>
the water pore volume. Lower incipient slurry point percent<br>
solids values indicate higher water absorption capacities or<br>
higher pore volume in the sample. The calcined alumina-<br>
containing materials from which the high-alumina matrix is<br>
derived in accordance with this invention will have<br>
incipient slurry points less than 57% solids, preferably 48<br>
to 52% solids. This compares with Satintone® No. 1 which<br>
yields over 58% solids in the incipient slurry point test.<br>
Accordingly, not only is the ultrafine hydrous kaolin<br>
useful as an alumina-containing material from which to<br>
derive the matrix of the catalyst microspheres, but the<br><br>
matrix may also be derived from delaminated kaolin, platelet<br>
alumina and precipitated alumina. Means for delaminating<br>
booklets or stacks of kaolin are well-known in the art.<br>
Preferred are those methods, which use a particulate<br>
grinding medium such as sand, or glass microballoons as is.<br>
well-known. Subsequent to delamination, the platelets are<br>
pulverized to derive the random packing or "house of cards"<br>
morphology.<br>
The pulverize-calcine-pulverize processing or nydrous<br>
kaolin is preferred to make the matrix precursor of the<br>
invention because it appears that, when the foregoing is<br>
used with hydrous kaolin as the metakaolin source to form<br>
the reactive precursor microspheres, superior attrition<br>
resistance results at high pore volume. While less<br>
preferred, matrix precursors may also be wet milled to<br>
further de-agglomerate the precursor. The milling appears to<br>
reduce microsphere pore volume, all other things held<br>
constant. A method to reduce microsphere pore volume is<br>
useful when pre-calcined metakaolin powder is used to form<br>
the reactive precursor microspheres. Dight has disclosed<br>
that employing metakaolin powder increases precursor<br>
microsphere pore volume, but excessive levels of zeolite and<br>
surface area can be required to make these microspheres<br>
acceptably attrition resistant. While helping to moderate<br>
the required zeolite content and also perhaps improving the<br>
dispersion of said milled matrix in the microsphere, the de-<br>
agglomeration appears to have the effect of breaking strong<br>
bonds which could have otherwise strenothened the final<br>
catalyst, and so is not preferred.<br>
It is also within the scope of this invention to derive<br>
the matrix from chemically synthesized spinel and/or<br>
mullite. Thus, Okata, et al., "Characterization of spinel<br><br>
phase from SiO2-Al2O3 xerogels and -the formation process of<br>
mullite", Journal of the American Ceramic Society, 69 [9]<br>
652-656 (1986), the entire contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference disclose that two kinds of<br>
xerogels can be prepared by slow and rapid hydrolysis of<br>
tetraethyoxy silane and aluminum nitrate nonahydrdate<br>
dissolved in ethanol.' The slow hydrolysis method involves<br>
gelling the above mixture in an oven at 60° C. for one to<br>
two weeks whereas the rapid hydrolysis method involves<br>
adding ammonium hydroxide solution to the mixture and drying<br>
in air. Xerogels prepared by the slow hydrolysis method<br>
crystallized mullite directly from the amorphous' state on<br>
firing whereas the xerogels formed by rapid hydrolysis<br>
crystallized a spinel phase before mullite formation. As<br>
long as such calcined synthetic materials have a water pore<br>
volume within the scope of this invention, such materials<br>
can be used to derive the high-alumina matrix of the<br>
catalyst of this invention.<br>
Preferably, the pore volume of the crystallized zeolite<br>
microsphere of this invention, which is formed using the<br>
high water pore volume alumina-containing materials as<br>
determined by the ISP test to form the catalyst matrix, is<br>
greater-than 0.27 cc/gm, preferably greater than 0.30 cc/gm<br>
of Hg in the range of 40-20.,.0000A diameter. More<br>
particularly, the catalyst of this invention has a macropore<br>
volume within pores having a size range of 600 to 20, 000A. of<br>
at least 0.07 cc/gm of Hg, and preferably at least 0.20<br>
cc/gm of Hg. While conventional zeolite-incorporated<br>
catalysts have macroporosities comparable to the catalysts<br>
of this invention, the incorporated catalysts do not have<br>
the. novel zeolite-on-matrix morphology nor performance of<br>
the catalysts of this invention. The catalysts of this<br><br>
invention will have a BET surface area less than 500 m2/g,<br>
preferably less than 475 m2/g and most preferably within a<br>
range of about 300-450 m2/g. The moderate surface area of<br>
the catalysts of this invention in combination with the<br>
macroporosity achieves the desired activity and<br>
selectivities to gasoline while reducing gas and coke<br>
yields.<br>
One skilled in the art will readily appreciate that it<br>
is the steam-aged surface area and activity that is truly<br>
significant and which must be balanced against the available<br>
pore volume. The cited preferred surface areas for finished<br>
product (fresh) catalyst are chosen such that the surface<br>
area after a 1500° F, four hour steaming at 1 atm steam<br>
pressure are generally below 300 m2/gm.<br>
It has further been found that the macroporosity of tne<br>
catalyst of this invention can be maintained even if a<br>
portion of the matrix is derived from coarse alumina-<br>
containing materials which otherwise do not meet the water<br>
pore volume desired by this invention as determined by the<br>
ISP test. Thus, it was found that blends of booklet kaolin<br>
clay and ultrafine kaolin clays that are calcined through<br>
the exotherm produce catalysts with high pore volume, wide<br>
macropores but with a lower zeolite content. Such catalysts<br>
can be valuable for exceptionally severe cracking<br>
environments.<br>
The general procedure for manufacturing the FCC<br>
microspheres of this invention is well-known in the art and<br>
can be followed from the procedure disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
No. 4,493,902. As disclosed therein, an aqueous' slurry of"<br>
reactive finely divided hydrous kaolin and/or metakaolin and<br><br>
the ultrafine kaolin that has been calcined through its<br>
characteristic exotherm is prepared. The aqueous slurry is<br>
then spray dried to obtain microspheres comprising a mixture.<br>
of hydrous kaolin and/or metakaolin and kaolin that has been<br>
calcined at least substantially through its characteristic<br>
exotherm to form the high-alumina matrix. Preferably, a<br>
moderate amount of sodium silicate is added to the aqueous<br>
slurry before it is spray dried. During and after spray<br>
drying the sodium silicate functions as a binder between the<br>
kaolin particles.<br>
The reactive kaolin or tne slurry to form tne<br>
microspheres can be formed of hydrated kaolin or calcined<br>
hydrous kaolin (metakaolin) or mixtures thereof. The<br>
hydrous kaolin of the feed slurry can suitably be either one<br>
or a mixture of ASP 600 or ASP 400 kaolin, derived from<br>
coarse white kaolin crudes. Finer-particle size hydrous<br>
kaolins can also be used, including those derived from gray<br>
clay deposits, such as LHT pigment. Purified water-<br>
processed kaolin clays from Middle Georgia have been used<br>
with success. Calcined products of these hydrous kaolins<br>
can be used as the metakaolin component of the feed slurry.<br>
The higher pore volume obtained using metakaolin can be<br>
offset by wet milling the matrix precursor. Silicate for<br>
the binder is preferably provided by sodium silicates with<br>
SiO2 to Na2O ratios of from 1.5 to 3.5 and especially<br>
preferred'ratios of from 2.88 to 3.22.<br>
A quantity (e.g., 3 to 30% by weight of the kaolin) of<br>
zeolite initiator may also be added to the aqueous slurry<br>
before it is spray dried. As used herein, the term "zeolite<br>
initiator" shall include any material containing silica and<br>
alumina that either allows a zeolite crystallization process<br>
that would not occur in the absence of the initiator or<br><br>
shortens significantly, the zeolite crystallization process<br>
. that would occur in the absence of the initiator. Such<br>
materials are also known as "zeolite seeds". The zeolite<br>
initiator may or may not exhibit detectable crystallinity by<br>
x-ray diffraction.<br>
Adding zeolite "initiator to the aqueous slurry of<br>
kaolin before it is spray dried into microspheres is<br>
referred to herein as "internal seeding*. Alternatively,<br>
zeolite initiator may be mixed with the kaolin microspheres<br>
after they are formed and before the commencement of the <br>
crystallization process, a technique which is referred to<br>
herein as "external seeding".<br>
The zeolite initiator used in the present invention may<br>
be provided from a number of sources. For example, the<br>
zeolite initiator may comprise recycled fines produced<br>
during the crystallization process itself. Other zeolite<br>
initiators that may be used include fines produced during<br>
the crystallization process of another zeolite product or an<br>
amorphous zeolite initiator in a sodium silicate solution.<br>
As used herein, "amorphous zeolite initiator" shall mean a<br>
zeolite initiator that exhibits no detectable crystallinity<br>
by x-ray diffraction.<br>
The seeds may be prepared as disclosed by in 4,493,902.<br>
Especially preferred seeds are disclosed in 4,631,2 62.<br>
After spray drying, the microspheres may be calcined<br>
directly, or alternatively acid-neutralized to further<br>
enhance ion exchange of the catalysts after crystallization.<br>
The acid-neutralization process comprises co-feeding<br>
uncalcined, spray dried microspheres and mineral acid to a<br>
stirred slurry at controlled pH. The rates of addition of<br>
solids and acid are adjusted to maintain a pH of about 2. to<br>
7, most preferably from about 2.5 to 4.5 with a target of<br><br>
about 3 pH. The sodium silicate binder is gelled to silica<br>
and a soluble sodium salt, which is subseqently filtered and<br>
washed free from the microspheres. The silica gel-bound<br>
microspheres are then calcined. In either case, calcination<br>
is done at a temperature and for a time (e.g., for two hours<br>
in a muffle furnace at a chamber temperature of about 1,350°<br>
F.) sufficient to convert any hydrated kaolin component of<br>
the microspheres to metakaolin, leaving the previously<br>
calcined kaolin components of the microspheres essentially<br>
unchanged. The resulting calcined porous microspheres<br>
comprise a mixture of metakaolin and kaolin clay calcined<br>
through its characteristic exotherra in which the two types<br>
of calcined kaolin are present in the same microspheres.<br>
Alternatively any appropriate calcined alumina can replace<br>
the kaolin calcined through the exotherm as previously<br>
described. In general, the weight ratio of metakaolin to<br>
calcined alumina should be about 1:0.66 to 1:4,'preferably<br>
1:1.5 to 1:3. Thus, calcined the microspheres should<br>
generally comprise about 25 - 60% by weight metakaolin and<br>
about 40 - 75% by weight kaolin that has been calcined<br>
through its characteristic exotherm. Preferably 30 - 40% by<br>
weight metakaolin and 60 - 70% by weight kaolin calcined<br>
through the exotherm are provided. Also present is Na2O and<br>
SiO2 derived from sodium silicate, binder.<br>
Y-faujasite is allowed to crystallize by mixing- the<br>
calcined kaolin microspheres with the appropriate amounts of<br>
other constituents (including at least sodium silicate and<br>
water) , as discussed in detail below, and then heating the<br>
resulting slurry to a tempexature and for a time (e.g., to<br>
200°-215° F. for 10-24 hours) sufficient to crystallize Y-<br>
faujasite in the microspheres. The prescriptions of<br><br>
4,493,902 may be followed as written. Equivalent,<br>
reformatted recipes are provided as follows, however.<br>
The crystallization recipes we employ are based on a<br>
set of assumptions and certain raw materials. The seeds are<br>
described by 4,631,262 and are preferably used externally.<br>
The Si02, A1203, and Na20 components of metakaolin, seeds,<br>
sodium silicate solution calcined sodium silicate binder,<br>
and silica gel are assumed to be 100% reactive. The alumina<br>
and silica in kaolin calcined through the exotherm to the<br>
spinel form are assumed to be 1% and 90% reactive<br>
respectively. Although these two values are in use, they<br>
are not believed to be accurate. The alumina and silica in<br>
kaolin calcined through the exotherm to the mullite form are<br>
assumed to be 0% and 67% reactive, respectively. These two<br>
values are believed to be accurate, representing the<br>
inertness of 3:2 mullite in crystallization and the full<br>
solubility of the free silica phase. Since metakaolin<br>
alumina is the limiting reagent in the synthesis and the<br>
volume of zeolite is much larger than the corresponding<br>
volume of metakaolin, it is important to limit the zeolite<br>
yield appropriately for a given microsphere pore volume.<br>
Otherwise, there will result little or no residual pore<br>
volume after crystallization. Such is the case for the<br>
prior art. On the other hand, if insufficient limiting<br>
reagent is available in the microsphere to grow sufficient<br>
zeolite to appropriately harden the catalyst, additional<br>
nutrient alumina may be added in the form of metakaolin<br>
microspheres, as is well known in this art. Thus, tight<br>
process control is enabled for pore volume and attrition.<br>
Using these assumptions, the following weight ratios<br>
for reactive components are used in the overall<br>
crystallization recipes. Inert components do not enter into<br><br>
the ratios, except in the case of the seeds dose, which is<br>
defined as the ratio of the grams of seeds A1203 to total<br>
grams of microspheres.<br><br>
The sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide reactants may-<br>
be added to the crystallization reactor from a variety of<br>
sources. For example, the reactants may be provided as an<br>
aqueous mixture of N® Brand sodium silicate and sodium<br>
hydroxide. As another example, at least part of the sodium<br>
silicate may be provided by the mother liquor produced<br>
during the crystallization of another zeolite-containina<br>
product.<br>
After the crystallization process is terminated, the<br>
microspheres containing Y-faujasite are separated from at<br>
least a substantial portion of their mother liquor, e.g., by<br>
filtration. It may be desirable to wash to microspheres by<br>
contacting them with water either during or after the<br>
filtration step. The purpose of the washing step is to<br>
remove. mother liquor that would otherwise be left entrained<br>
within the microspheres.<br>
"Silica Retention" may be practiced. The teachings of<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,493,902 at column 12, lines 3-31,<br><br>
regarding silica retention are incorporated herein by cross-<br>
reference.<br>
The microspheres that are filtered contain Y-faujasite<br>
zeolite in the sodium form. Typically,the microspheres<br>
contain more than about 8% by weight Na2O. To prepare the<br>
microspheres of the present invention, a substantial portion<br>
of the sodium ions in the microspheres are replaced by<br>
ammonium or rare earth ions or both.<br>
Ion exchange may be conducted by a number of different<br>
ion exchange methods. Preferably, the microspheres are<br>
first exchanged one or more times with an ammonium nitrate<br>
solution at a pH of about 3-4. The ion exchange (s) with<br>
ammonium ions are preferably followed by one or more ion<br>
exchanges. with rare earth ions at a.pH of about 3-4. The<br>
rare earth may be provided as a single rare earth material<br>
or as a mixture of rare earth materials. Preferably, the<br>
rare earth is provided in the form of nitrates or chlorides.<br>
The preferred microspheres of the invention are ion<br>
exchanged to contain.between 0% and 12% by weight REO, most<br>
preferably 0.5% to 8% by weight REO and less than about<br>
0.5%, more preferably less than about 0.4%, and most<br>
preferably about 0.2% by weight Na2O. As is well known, an<br>
intermediate calcination will be required to reach these<br>
soda levels.<br>
After ion exchange is completed, the microspheres are<br>
filtered and dried. The procedure described above for ion<br>
exchanging the FCC microsphere catalysts of this invention<br>
is well-known and, as such, such process, per se, does not .<br>
form the basis of this invention.<br>
The microspheres of the invention may be marketed<br>
either in a pure form or blended with other catalysts,<br>
additives and/or other blending agents.<br><br>
The catalyst of the present invention, like all<br>
commercial fluid catalytic cracking catalysts, will be<br>
hydrothermally deactivated during the operation of the<br>
cracking unit. Accordingly, as used herein, the phrase<br>
"cracking the petroleum feedstock in the presence of a<br>
catalyst" shall include cracking the petroleum feedstock in<br>
the presence of the catalyst in its fresh, partially<br>
deactivated, or fully deactivated form.<br>
The preferred catalyst of the invention comprises<br>
microspheres containing at least 40% and preferably from 50%<br>
to 65% by weight Y-faujasite, expressed on the basis of the<br>
as-crystallized sodium faujasite form of zeolite." As used<br>
herein, the term Y-faujasite shall include synthetic<br>
faujasite zeolites exhibiting, in the sodium form, an X-ray<br>
diffraction pattern of the type described in Breck, Zeolite<br>
Molecular Sieves, p. 369, Table 4.90 (1974), and having a<br>
crystalline unit cell size, in the sodium form (after<br>
washing any crystallization mother liquor from the zeolite),<br>
of less than about 24.75 A as determined by the technique<br>
described in the ASTM standard method of testing titled<br>
"Determination of the Unit Cell Size Dimension of a<br>
Faujasite Type Zeolite" (Designation D3942-80) or by an<br>
equivalent technique. The term Y-faujasite shall encompass<br>
the zeolite in its sodium form.as well as in the known<br>
modified forms, including, e.g., rare earth and ammonium<br>
exchanged forms and stabilized forms. The percentage of Y-<br>
faujasite zeolite in the microspheres of the catalyst is<br>
determined when the zeolite is in the sodium form (after it<br>
has been washed to remove any crystallization mother liquor<br>
contained within the microspheres) by the technique<br>
described in ASTM standard method of testing titled<br>
"Relative Zeolite Diffraction Intensities" (Designation<br><br>
D3906-80) or by an equivalent technique. It is important to<br>
equilibrate the microspheres carefully before X-ray<br>
evaluations are made since equilibration can have a<br>
significant effect on the results.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the unique morphology of the FCC.<br>
catalysts of this invention achievable from a unique<br>
alumina-containing material' used to derive the catalyst<br>
matrix not previously used or even thought useful in the<br>
prior art of in-situ zeolite catalyst formation. Again,<br>
from the discussion' above, it was thought that the less<br>
porous catalyst microspheres were superior products in view<br>
of the excellent attrition resistance, high activity and<br>
selectivity provided, especially in light of the well<br>
established fact that these catalysts have, selectivity at<br>
least equivalent to lower surface area, higher pore volume<br>
catalysts, and frequently better selectivity at short<br>
contact time. Assertions to the contrary would easily be<br>
dismissed as self-serving and would also be tantamount to<br>
saying the so-called incorporated catalysts were diffusion-<br>
limited at short residence time. It has only recently been<br>
discovered that under the short contact time FCC processing,<br>
FCC catalysts technologies may be diffusion limited with<br>
respect to transport in pores external to the zeolite. This<br>
is proposed to be the reason that the API gravity of the<br>
' bottoms fraction has often risen after SCT revamp Less<br>
obvious than that, it now appears that conventional, prior<br>
art catalysts fail to provide all of the potential gains of<br>
the SCT hardware. But heretofore there was no way to know <br>
what benefits were absent. Accordingly, the catalyst<br>
microspheres of this invention have a substantially<br>
different morphology than the previous catalyst<br>
microspheres, especially with respect to the increased pore<br><br>
volume, zeolite-on-matrix morphology, and moderate surface<br>
area. Attrition resistance of these catalyst is good and<br>
effective for the SCT FCC processing conditions.<br>
As can be seen from Figure 1, the catalyst of this<br>
invention includes a macroporous matrix in which the<br>
macropores of the matrix are formed from a random<br>
configuration of porous matrix planar structures which are<br>
lined on the opposing surfaces of the planes with the<br>
zeolite crystals. Thus, the macropores of the catalyst are<br>
lined with the active zeolite crystals. In Figure 1, the<br>
mesoporous matrix planes are formed from mullite particles.<br>
The macroporosity-of the catalyst allows the hydrocarbons<br>
to enter the catalyst freely and the increased macropore<br>
surface area'thereof allows such hydrocarbons to contact the<br>
catalytic surfaces. Importantly, the hydrocarbons can<br>
contact the zeolite unobstructed, rendering the catalyst<br>
very active and selective to gasoline. While conventional<br>
incorporated zeolite catalysts, in which the zeolite .<br>
crystals are incorporated within a binder and/or matrix,<br>
have a highly porous matrix, at least a portion of the<br>
binder coats or otherwise obstructs the zeolite crystals.<br>
In the present microspheroidal catalysts, there is no need-<br>
for'a separate physical'binder which glues the zeolite to<br>
the matrix surface other than any minute amounts of silicate,<br>
which may remain subsequent to zeolite crystallization. It<br>
is believed that the microsphere catalysts formed in<br>
accordance with the process of the present invention yield<br>
the highest accessibility to the zeolite of any<br>
zeolite/matrix catalyst.<br>
It has been found that the microspheroidal catalysts of<br>
the present invention provide high conversions via low coke<br>
selectivity and higher selectivities to gasoline relative to<br><br>
previous FCC catalysts presently on the market. It is<br>
surprising that this catalyst can consistently outperform<br>
conventional incorporated catalysts of similar or even<br>
higher porosity and lower surface area. This shows that<br>
having added porosity alone is not sufficient. It is now<br>
believed that the novel structured catalysts, being both<br>
macroporous and with the raacropore walls lined with zeolite<br>
and with the mesoporous or microporous matrix substantially<br>
behind the zeolite layer are the reasons the catalyst excels<br>
at gasoline, LCO and coke selectivity. The present catalyst<br>
is sufficient to crack the heavier hydrocarbons and improve<br>
the API gravity of the bottom fraction, especially during<br>
the short contact time processing. Prior to this invention,<br>
it was conventionally thought and routinely asserted that<br>
the best results for bottoms cracking in short contact time<br>
would be obtained by a "staged cracking" mechanism, wherein<br>
heavy feed components were forced to contact a meso- or<br>
microporous matrix such as alumina derived from peptized<br>
pseudoboehmite which covered or coated the zeolite. Our<br>
results show, surprisingly, that precisely the opposite is<br>
true.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the present<br>
invention:<br>
Example 1<br>
A microsphere was prepared containing 30 parts of<br>
metakaolin (MK) , 20 parts of wet media-milled Ansilex 93™,<br>
20 parts of media-milled HiOpague™ pigment calcined beyond<br>
1,050° C, and 30 parts of NuSurf™ pigment which had been<br>
directly calcined beyond 1,050° C., pulverized and fluid-<br>
energy milled. To this mixture of calcined kaolins'was<br><br>
NuSurf™ is a coarse fraction of delaminated hydrous<br>
kaolin. This product was calcined at 2350° F. for four<br>
hours in cordierite trays to obtain maximal yield of well-<br>
crystallized mullite, crushed, then fluid energy milled with<br>
air (Micron Master Jet Pulverizer, Jet Pulverizer Co,<br>
- Palmyra, NY) to 90% 
was easily made down.at 50% solids using, tap water and 3 ml<br>
Colloid 211 per kg of dry kaolin in a Cowles mixer to form a<br>
non-dilatant slurry. The ease of the make-down suggested<br>
that the hydrous pigment was not optimally pulverized before<br>
calcination or the fluid energy milling had compressed the<br>
aggregates.<br>
Each of the four component slurries was maintained in<br>
suspension by rolling in sealed jugs until required for<br>
blending.<br>
The. slurry for spray drying was formed by mixing tne<br>
four component slurries in the 30:20:20:30 ratio on a 4 kg<br>
overall dry basis, as noted above, in a Cowles mixer.<br>
Directly to this slurry 2.14 kg of N-brand® Sodium Silicate<br>
was added to form a mixture at 45.7% solids which was-<br>
sufficiently fluid to pump and spray dry. The material was<br>
spray dried using a 0.6 mm single fluid nozzle at 700 psi<br>
The as-sprayed material had a 0.71 gm/ml ABD (apparent<br>
bulk density) and analyzed with 3.9% Na2O, or 13.1% binder<br>
as Sio2. This product was calcined directly at 1500o P. i<br>
a pre-heated furnace using open cordierite trays during ti<br>
hours. The product had 0.356 cc/gm pore volume in the 40<br>
20,000 A diameter range by mercury perimetry, a 76 um A<br>
and 14.2 wt.% acid-solubles (U.S. Patent No. 5,023,220;<br>
column 18, line 59) and a 0.71 gm/cc ABD<br><br>
added 15 parts of Si02 added from N-brand® sodium silicate.<br>
This microsphere was not acid-neutralized.The me.takaolin<br>
source was Metamax™, a pulverized powder, made down at 55%<br>
solids in tap water with 3 ml Colloid 211 surfactant (Viking<br>
Industries, Atlanta, GA) per kg of calcined kaolin. An air-<br>
driven Cowles mixer was used in a batch process where the<br>
dry kaolin was added to the water that already contained the<br>
surfactant. The kaolin was added more slowly to the water<br>
as the mixture thickened. A very dilatant slurry was formed<br>
but continued mixing reduced the viscosity. Gradual<br>
addition of the kaolin and continued mixing" during 45<br>
minutes or more led to a slurry for,which the dilatancy was<br>
no longer apparent by casual inspection.<br>
The media-milled Ansilex 93™ pigment was derived from<br>
a mixture of commercially produced slurries of 50% and 60%<br>
solids content. About 7 gallons of these slurries was<br>
placed in a stirred feed tank of a 4 L agitated media mill<br>
(Premier Mill Corp., Reading PA). Three passes through the<br>
mill at about 4 minutes residence time each gave 90% less<br>
than 1.66 um by laser scattering (Horiba) at 51% solids.<br>
HiOpague ™ is a calcined pigment derived from<br>
delaminated kaolin. Commercially produced pigment was<br>
further calcined using cordierite trays and a. pre-heated<br>
high temperature electric furnace at 2350° F. during four-<br>
hours, in order to obtain the maximum yield of well-<br>
crystallized mullite. The furnace product was then crushed<br>
to form a powder, made down and wet media milled as above in<br>
four passes. The final product was 90% 
scattering and at 37% solids by specific gravity. Both wet-<br>
milled slurries were very low in viscosity.<br><br>
NuSurfTM is a coarse fraction of delaminated hydrous<br>
kaolin. This product was calcined at 2350° F. for four<br>

was added to form a mixture at 45.7% solids which was.<br>
sufficiently fluid to pump and spray dry. The material was<br>
spray dried using a 0.6 mm single fluid nozzle at 700 psi.<br>
The as-sprayed material had a 0.71 gm/ml ABD (apparent<br>

as SiO2. This product was calcined directly at 1500° F. in<br>
a pre-heated furnace using open cordierite trays during two<br>
hours. The product had 0.3 56 cc/gm pore volume in the 40-<br>
20,000 A diameter range by mercury poro. imetry, a 76 um APS<br>
and 14.2 wt.% acid-solubles (U.S. Patent No. 5,023,220;<br>

laser scattering was 90%

The slurry for spray drying was formed by mixing the<br>
four component slurries in the 30:20:20:30 ratio on a 3.93<br>
kg overall dry basis as noted above in a Cowles mixer.<br>
Directly to this slurry 2.11 kg of N-brand ®'Sodium<br>
Silicate, was added to form a mixture at 48% solids, which<br>
was sufficiently fluid to pump and spray dry. The material<br>
was spray dried using a 0.6 mm single fluid nozzle at 70.0<br>
psi.<br>
The as-sprayed material had a 0.72 gm/ml ABD and<br>
analyzed with 4.01% Na2O, or 13.5% SiO2 binder. This<br>
product was acid-neutralized by feeding the as spray dried<br>
microspheres to a bucket of cool stirred tap water, while<br>
co-feeding sufficient 40 Wt.% H2SO2 to keep the pH of the<br>
slurry between about 2.5 and 4. After all of the solids<br>
were added, the pH was monitored and controlled for 10<br>
minutes"before filtering and washing with about 2 gallons of<br>
tap water per Kg of microspheres, and then dried overnight<br>
at about 350° F.<br>
The acid-neutralized microspheres were calcined<br>
directly at 1500° F. in pre-heated furnace using open<br>
cordierite trays during three hours. The product had 0.402<br>
cc/gm pore volume in the 40-20,000 range by mercury<br>
porosimetry, a 77 um APS and 14.4 wt.% acid-solubles and a<br>
0.6F gm/cc ABD.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
A microsphere was prepared containing 3 0 parts of MK,<br>
20 parts of wet media-milled Ansilex 93™ 20 parts of ball-<br>
milled NuSurf™ pigment calcined beyond 1,050° C, and 30<br>
parts of NuSurf™ mullite aggregates prepared by pulverizing<br>
the hydrous pigment before calcining beyond 1,050° C., plus<br>
15 parts of SiO2 added from N-brand® sodium silicate. This<br>
microsphere was acid-neutralized.<br>
The MK source was a second batch of Metamax™ made down<br>
at 55% solids with C211 dispersant. The media-milled<br>
Ansilex 93™ was the same slurry as prepared in Example 1.<br>
The ball-milled NuSurf™ mullite was prepared by<br>
calcining the hydrous delaminated pigment at 2350° F. for<br>
four hours in cordierite trays in a pre-heated furnace.<br>
This material was crushed, pulverized, and then' wet ball<br>
milled at 46% solids. The final product was a low viscosity<br>
slurry with 90%
The NuSurf™ mullite in this example was prepared to<br>
assure the formation of high pore volume aggregates with a<br>
house of cards structure. NuSurf™ delaminated hydrous<br>
pigment was slurried with water and dispersant, spray dried<br>
into densely packed microspheres, and subsequently<br>
pulverized to obtain a low density powder. This hydrous<br>
powder was calcined at 2350° F. in cordierite trays for four<br>
hours to form well-crystallized mullite. The product was<br>
crushed and pulverized to a powder, then made down at 50%<br>
solids using 4 ml C211 per kg of calcined kaolin using a<br>
Cowles mixer. This slurry was initially very dilatant and<br>
difficult to make down. Mixing was continued until the<br><br>
Example 3<br>
'A microsphere of exceptionally high pore volume and<br>
with unusually wide macropores was prepared with 30 parts of<br>
MK and 70 parts of NuSurf™ mullite aggregates; the latter<br>
prepared by pulverizing before calcining beyond 1,050° C.<br>
The calcined kaolin mixture was spray dried with 15 parts of<br>
Si02 added from N-brand® sodium silicate. This microsphere<br>
was acid-neutralized.<br>
The MK source was the same batch of Metamax™ made down<br>
in Example 2. The NuSurf™ mullite (aggregates) was also<br>
the same batch made down for Example 2. The two slurries<br>
tfere kept in suspension by rolling in sealed jugs until<br>
needed for blending.<br>
The slurry for spray drying was formed by mixing the<br>
two component slurries in the 30:70 ratio on a 4.00 kg<br>
overall dry basis as noted above in a Cowles mixer. To this<br>
slurry 2.14 kg of N-brand® Sodium Silicate was added to<br>
form a mixture at 48% solids, which was sufficiently fluid<br>
to pump and spray dry. The material was spray dried using a<br>
0.6 mm single fluid nozzle at 700 psi.<br>
The as-sprayed material had a 0.56 gm/ml ABD and<br>
analyzed with 3.92% Na2O, or 13.1% SiO2 binder. This<br>
product was acid-neutralized and dried as per the procedure<br>
of Example 2. The acid-neutralized microspheres were<br>
calcined directly at 1500° F. in pre-heated furnace using<br>
open cordierite trays during three hours. The product had<br>
0.407 cc/gm pore volume in the 40-20,000 A diameter range<br>
and an additional 0.156 cc/gm in the 20,000. to 40,000 A<br>
diameter range by mercury porosimetry, a 86 urn APS and 10.6<br>
wt. % acid-solubles with a 0.53 gm/cc ABD.<br><br>
Examples 4-6.<br>
• The microspheres of Examples 1-3 were crystallized<br>
during 23 hours to form zeolite Y by conventional procedures<br>
(4,493,902, and 5,395,809) with the following results. The<br>
seeds are described by 4,631,262.<br><br>
The mercury pore volume of these materials is<br>
considerably higher than provided for by the prior art of in<br>
situ crystallization. The sodium-form catalysts were then<br>
ion-exchanged to finished products as follows. Sodium-form<br>
catalyst was added to 27 wt. % ammonium nitrate solution at<br>
180° F and pH of 2.8-3.2 while.stirring and adding 50% HNO3<br>
drop-wise to control pH. After all of the catalyst was<br>
added, the slurry was stirred for 15 minutes, filtered, and<br>
the cake washed with twice" the dry catalyst weight of de-<br>
ionized water. Two such exchanges were done where the<br>
weight ratio of catalyst to 27 wt. % ammonium nitrate was<br>
1:2. The samples were then rare earth exchanged at 180° F.<br>
and pH of 4 to yield about 3% REO on the catalyst. The Na2O<br><br>
content at this point was 1.8 to 1.9 Wt., considerably lower<br>
than prior art formulations.<br>
The partially-exchanged materials were dried and then<br>
calcined at 1150° F. in pre-heated furnaces for two hours in<br>
covered silica trays while initially containing 25 Wt.%<br>
moisture. After calcination, the ammonium exchange<br>
procedure was repeated either five (Example 4) or three<br>
(Examples 5, 6) times, then calcined again at 25% moisture<br>
and 1150° F. to form the finished product. The results are<br>
as follows:<br><br>
It can be seen that the use of increasing amounts of<br>
properly pre-pulverized hydrous delaminated kaolin leads to<br>
more catalyst pore volume and wider macropores. An SEM<br>
image of the catalyst of Example 6 is shown in Figure 1. The<br>
dark areas are the macropores which are clearly formed by<br>
the random or "house of cards" configuration of the sheets<br><br>
of matrix derived from delaminated pigment'. The smaller<br>
granules sandwiched between the larger crystals of zeolite<br>
have been positively identified as mullite crystals. The<br>
larger crystals coated or otherwise lining the mullite<br>
matrix have been positively identified as zeolite Y.<br>
Inclusion of both mullite and.spinel leads to a tri-<br>
modal pore size distribution. The porosity intrinsic to the<br>
spinel and mullite-phases are visible in the mercury pore<br>
size data, indicating that these mesoporous matrices are not<br>
occluded by the zeolite which grows upon them. This is<br>
confirmed by the reduced volume within the nitrogen<br>
hysteresis loops (Figure 2) obtained for finished product<br>
catalysts that were steamed at' 1500° F. in 100% steam for<br>
four hours. Two comparative Examples are shown from U.S.<br>
Patent No.'5,395,809.<br>
Example 7<br>
This example describes the use of blends of coarse and<br>
fine matrix kaolins useful for lower surface area<br>
formulations which retain wide macropores and excellent<br>
catalytic performance.<br>
A series of short test runs to convert kaolins to<br>
mullite and silica were conducted on a production-scale<br>
rotary calciner that was direct-fired with natural gas. In<br>
one case booklet-type clays (NOKARB™) calcined to form the<br>
matrix for the FCC catalysts described by U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,493,902 and 5,395,809 were being produced, and at the end<br>
of the campaign the calciner severity was raised to maximize<br>
the yield of mullite. A product was collected for pilot<br>
spray drying work. Later, Ansilex 93™ (A93) pigment was to<br>
be made. A93 is made from gray clay having 90% finer than 1<br>
um by sedimentation. The fractionated hydrous kaolin has<br><br>
been spray dried and then pulverized to a low density-<br>
powder. Just before the A93 production run the calciner<br>
severity was increased to raise the mullite content of the<br>
initial product to the maximum extent possible, and a sample<br>
was taken of this product ("M93") . Much later it was<br>
determined that this material was in fact derived from a<br>
mixture of booklet clays and the ultrafine hydrous kaolins.<br>
The exact proportions of the mixture could not be<br>
determined, but Fe203, SEM and water pore volume results<br>
confirmed that intermixing had indeed occurred. The M93 was<br>
about 58% converted to fully crystallized mullite by X-ray<br>
diffraction.<br>
A microsphere was made from the M93 mixed calcined<br>
kaolin product by diluting 33.3 parts (dry basis) of LHT<br>
hydrous pigment slurry with water in a Cowles mixer and then<br>
adding 66.7 parts of dry M93 in a batch process, along with<br>
sufficient dispersant to make a fluid mixture. The mixture<br>
contained 50% solids but exhibited some residual dilatancy.<br>
The slurry was fed to a spray dryer with a wheel atomizer<br>
having a single row of circular openings. 4.1 parts (as<br>
SiO2) of sodium silicate binder solution having a 2.88<br>
SiO2/Na2O were injected into the slurry at the entrance of<br>
an in line static mixer placed just upstream of the<br>
atomizer.<br>
The microspheres were calcined to convert the hydrous<br>
kaolin to metakaolin but without reaching the characteristic<br>
exotherm. The Na2O content was 1.40 wt. %, the acid<br>
solubles were 14.72 wt. %, the APS was 91 um, the ABD 0.6<br>
gm/cc, and the Hg pore volume between 40 and 20,000 A<br>
diameter was 0.520 gm/cc.<br><br>
Example 8<br>
The microspheres of Example 7 were crystallized during<br>
22 hours to form zeolite Y by conventional procedures (U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 4,493/902; 5,395,809) with the results as shown<br>
in Table 3.<br><br>
The sodium-form catalyst was ion exchanged to 1.75 wt.<br>
% Na2O and 3.14 wt. % REO as above, calcined as above and<br>
then ammonium exchanged as above to 0.23 wt. % Na2O, then<br>
calcined as prescribed above to obtain the finished product.<br>
The finished product was steamed at 1500° F. in 1 atm of<br>
steam in an open quartz tube for four hours. The properties<br>
were as found in Table 4.<br>
Example 9<br>
This is a comparative example. A commercially-prepared<br>
catalyst made substantially by the methods of U.S. Patent<br>
No. 5,395,809 were obtained, analyzed and tested.<br><br>
Example 10<br>
This is a comparative example. A sample of FCC<br>
catalyst by the name of "GDO" was analyzed and tested. The<br>
method of manufacture is not specifically known, however it<br>
is presumed that this is representative of the state of the<br>
art for incorporated catalysts made with an aluminum<br>
chlorohydrol binder and formulated with additional granular<br>
alumina for bottoms cracking.<br><br><br>
Examples 11-12<br>
Catalytic performance was determined using an ACE™<br>
microscale fixed fluidized bed unit operating at a<br>
superficial 8 WHSV and 980° F. using 9 grams of catalyst and<br>
a gas oil A feed (Table 5) , substantially as described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,069,012, with the 2.125" injector<br>
position. The patent suggests this injector position<br>
corresponds to a 2-2.5 sec riser residence time. The<br>
catalyst strip time was held constant at 575 sec. The<br>
catalysts of Examples 8 and 9 were diluted with activity-<br>
adjusting microspheres as disclosed by Brown in the '902<br>
patent. However, in order to remain faithful to the<br>
teachings of U.S. Patent No. 6,069,012 and conventional<br>
reaction engineering, it is clear that different catalysts-<br>
should be evaluated at constant bed volume. This ensures<br>
that vapor residence time is constant in the comparisons.<br>
In an effort to do this, these catalyst formulations were<br>
blended to equal ABD and tested at constant weight. This is<br>
done by using appropriate amounts of the activity-adjusting<br>
microspheres cited by Brown (ca. 0.98 ABD), and the<br>
microspheres of Example 3 (0.53 ABD)<br>
The ABD of comparative catalysts such as Example 10<br>
could not be adjusted. This catalyst was therefore tested<br>
at both 9 grams of charge (low catalyst volume) and at about<br>
11 grams of charge (equal catalyst volume). In order to<br>
maintain constant hydrodynamics, the superficial WHSV in the<br>
latter case was adjusted to 6.6 to give the same oil<br>
delivery rate (gms/min). Coke, LCO and gasoline<br>
selectivities were more favorable for the comparative<br>
example at the latter condition, and so these results are<br>
reported in Table 6.<br><br><br>
As is known from commercial experience, the comparative<br>
Example 9 has very favorable selectivity in short contact<br>
time cracking, even when compared to catalysts with<br>
substantially higher pore volume. Because both Example 9<br>
and the catalyst of '902 also have substantially higher<br>
surface area than conventional catalysts, it had previously<br>
and reasonably been concluded that transport phenomena are<br>
not limiting in FCC catalyst performance. The present<br>
results show the surprising improvement in selectivity over<br>
the prior art of Example 9, already a leading technology,<br>
and the further surprising advantage over a high pore volume<br>
catalyst which has much lower surface area. Conventional<br>
thinking would lead one to believe that if transport was<br>
indeed generally limiting, Example 10 would perform the<br>
best, which is not the case. The deficit of the catalyst of<br>
Example 10 in bottoms upgrading is particularly surprising<br>
in light of the lower steamed ZSA/MSA ratio and higher<br><br>
alumina content of that catalyst vs. the catalysts of the<br>
invention.<br>
Primary cracking product selectivities have been<br>
improved using the catalysts of the invention. These<br>
catalysts show the unusual and desirable traits of higher •<br>
gasoline selectivity at constant steamed unit cell size,<br>
often with higher olefinicity. Higher LCO selectivity at<br>
constant conversion is observed simultaneously with lower<br>
coke selectivity. Prior to the catalysts of the invention,<br>
such performance characteristics normally had to be traded<br>
off one against another.<br><br>
Example 11<br>
A fractionated (90% 
kaolin slurry derived from a gray clay deposit was spray<br>
dried and pulverized as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,586,523. The material was then calcined at higher<br>
severity so as to convert it 50% to 80% of the way to well-<br><br>
crystallized mullite, as measured by X-ray diffraction line<br>
intensities relative to a kaolin which had been fully<br>
converted as in the '902 patent, Example 4. Typical<br>
properties of this material, also designated M93, are listed<br>
in Table 7, along with comparative materials.<br>
The preferred calcined kaolins used' as FCC catalyst<br>
matrix precursors have ISP percent solids below about 57%,<br>
more preferably, below 55% solids, and most preferably in<br>
the range of 48-52% solids. This is to say, having higher<br>
water pore volumes than precursors used in the prior art.<br>
The laser particle size we prefer is 90% less than about 10<br>
um, so that suitable microspheres can be formed. The<br>
simplest test for acceptability is the tamped bulk density,<br>
and this should be less than about 0.45 gm/cc, more<br>
preferably less than 0.40 gm/cc. Tamped bulk density, loose<br>
bulk density, mercury volume and ISP solids all correlate<br>
with each other.<br>
The kaolin-based materials may have any value of<br>
mullite index so long as they meet the previous<br>
requirements, but they must have passed substantially<br>
through'the exotherm in order to yield residual mesoporous<br>
or microporous matrix. The resulting matrix surface area<br>
and modal pore diameter varies smoothly as the relative<br>
mullite crystallite size is-varied.<br><br><br><br>
The M93 of the present example along with C211<br>
dispersant was added on a continuous basis to a dispersed<br>
slurry of LHT pigment in water using a staged Cowles system.<br>
The addition rates were controlled such that the blended<br>
slurry contained 33 parts of LHT hydrous pigment to 67 parts<br>
of M93 calcined matrix precursor at 48 to 50% solids. The<br>
mixture was then spray dried to form microspheres.<br>
Additional water was added as needed to control dilatancy<br>
and improve atomization. The slurry was fed to a spray dryer<br>
with a wheel atomizer. 4 parts (as Si02) of sodium silicate<br><br>
binder solution having a 2.88 SiO2/Na2O were injected into<br>
the slurry at the entrance of an in line static mixer placed<br>
just upstream of the atomizer. The resulting microspheres<br>
were calcined in a direct-fired rotary calciner to convert<br>
the hydrous kaolin in the mixture to metakaolin but without<br>
reaching the characteristic exotherm.<br>
The Na2O content was 1.73 wt. %, the acid solubles were<br>
16.23 wt. %, the APS was 82 urn, the ABD 0.47 gm/cc, and the<br>
Hg pore volume between 40 and 20,000 A diameter was 0.679<br>
gm/cc.<br>
The microspheres were crystallized in plant-scale<br>
reactors using about 95.0 gallons of seeds, 8,612 gals 30 wt.<br>
% recycled and concentrated sodium di.-silicate, 600 gallons<br>
of 19% NaOH, 938 gals of water, 23,897 lbs of the above<br>
microspheres, and an additional 3,259 lbs of metakaolin<br>
microspheres, these latter microspheres prepared<br>
substantially as described by 3,647,718. The amount of the<br>
metakaolin microsphere was chosen to control the porosity<br>
and roller attrition of the finished product tightly to<br>
specification. The residuals of this second microsphere are<br>
believed to have been largely removed by centrifugal<br>
separation devices.<br>
The product of the crystallizations were filtered,<br>
washed to remove excess mother liquor, ion exchanged to<br>
about 2.5% Na2O and 3% REO, calcined in rotary calciners to<br>
migrate the sodium but not substantially reduce unit cell<br>
size, ammonium exchanged again to about 0.2% Na2O, then<br>
calcined again to reduce the zeolite unit cell size. These<br>
catalyst work-up processes are previously known and merely<br>
adopted without modification for the present work.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
The catalyst of Example 11 was provided to an FCC unit<br>
following the use of a conventional FCC catalyst. The unit<br>
was equipped with modern feed nozzles and riser termination<br>
devices and had a riser contact time of 2.0 to 2.5 seconds..<br>
After introduction of the catalyst of Example 11, the<br>
conversion of the unit was observed to increase by 3 LV%, at<br>
constant coke. Gasoline yield was increased concurrently<br>
with increased light olefins, and most significantly,<br>
bottoms API gravity was reduced to levels not previously<br>
observed. -The improvement in bottoms cracking was<br>
remarkable since it came without a penalty in dry gas yield<br>
or delta coke.<br>
Because the fixed fluid bed used was relatively new and<br>
had not been publicly calibrated, a post-audit of the ACE™<br>
technique was conducted using the equilibrium catalysts from<br>
before and after the trial. The properties of the<br>
equilibrium catalysts are listed in Table 8. The ACE™ was<br>
run as before, using the 2.125" injector position and feed<br>
obtained during the trial,. The catalytic results are listed<br>
in Table 9 and presented in Figure 3 in the form of yield<br>
deltas against the conventional catalyst on feed B'<br>
calculated at constant coke. The results from the fixed<br>
fluid bed unit substantially reproduce the deltas from the<br>
FCC unit with reasonable accuracy.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Example 13<br>
The porous microspheres of Example 12 required<br>
excessive amounts of the second metakaolin microsphere to<br>
control attrition and porosity to specification. The green<br>
strength of the microspheres has also led to abrasion<br>
problems. These microspheres are therefore improved by<br>
increasing hydrous kaolin (to reduce the addition of the<br>
second microsphere) and binder (to improve green strength)<br>
Microspheres are prepared with about 37 to 40% hydrous<br>
kaolin and 63% to 60% M93 prepared as described in Example<br>
12. About 8% binder as silica is added by injection and the<br>
microspheres are calcined to convert hydrous kaolin to<br>
metakaolin. Green strength is improved in both cases.<br>
Crystallization of the microspheres at varying doses of the<br>
second metakaolin microsphere shows that the same or lower<br>
dose of the second microsphere leads to acceptable<br>
properties for the catalyst of the invention.<br><br>

modifications, and improvements will become apparent to the<br>
