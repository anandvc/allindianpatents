DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The   present   invention   relates   to   novel   amphiphilic   water-soluble   alkoxylated<br>
polyalkylenimines of the general formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R are identical or different, linear or branched C2-C6-alkylene radicals;<br>
B is a branch;<br>
E is an alkylenoxy unit of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

R2 is ethylene;<br>
R3is 1,2-propylene;<br>
R4 are identical or different radicals: hydrogen; C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
x, y, z are each from 2 to 150, where the sum of x+y+z means a number of alkylenimine<br>
units which corresponds to an average molecular weight Mw of the polyalkylenimine<br>
before the alkoxylation of from 300 to 10 000;<br>
m is a rational number from 0 to 2;<br>
n is a rational number from 6 to 18;<br>
p is a rational number from 3 to 12, where 0.8 ≤ n/p ≤ 1.0 (x+y+z)1/2;<br>
and quaternization products thereof.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of these alkoxylated polyalkylenimines as a soil detachment-promoting additive to laundry detergents and cleaning compositions, and to laundry detergents and cleaning compositions which comprise the alkoxylated polyalkylenimines.<br>
In addition to surfactants, polymers are also used as soil detachment-promoting additives for laundry detergents and cleaning compositions. The known polymers are very suitable, for example, as dispersants of soil pigments such as clay minerals or soot, and as additives which prevent the reattachment of already detached soil. Such dispersants are, though, especially at low temperatures, substantially ineffective in the removal of greasy soil from the surfaces.<br>
WO-A-99/67352 describes dispersants for hydrophobic soil which are compatible with peroxidic bleaches, are said to prevent the resettling of the greasy soil detached in the course of washing onto the cleaned textile and are based on alkoxylated polyethylenimines which have an inner polypropylene oxide block and an outer, distinctly larger polyethylene oxide block.<br>
US-A-5 565 145 recommends, as dispersants for nonpolar particulate soil, uncharged alkoxylated polyethylenimines which may contain up to 4 propylene oxide units per active NH group bonded directly to the nitrogen atom. However, preferred and demonstrated by way of example are polyethylenimines which are exclusively ethoxylated or at most incipiently propoxylated, i.e. not more than 1 mol of propylene oxide per NH group.<br>
These alkoxylated polyethylenimines too are good dispersants for hydrophilic soil pigments, but do not show a satisfactory wash result in the case of greasy stains.<br>
Polyethylenimines which have an inner polyethylene. oxide block and an outer polypropylene oxide block are yet to be used in laundry detergents or cleaning compositions.<br>
US-A-4 076 497 discloses the use of initially ethoxylated and then propoxylated polyethylenimines which have been reacted in total with 30 mol of alkylene oxide, including at least 15 mol of propylene oxide, per mole of active NH group as assistants for the dyeing of polyester and cellulose fibers with dispersion dyes. However, the<br>
alkylenoxy chains of the inventive polyalkylenimines contain at most 12 propylenoxy units.<br>
DE-A-22 27 546 describes, as well as polyethylenimines which have the reverse alkylene oxide sequence, also polyethylenimines which have initially been ethoxylated and then propoxylated as breakers for crude oil emulsions. However, in comparison to the inventive polyalkylenimines, these polyethylenimines have too high a total degree of alkoxylation of at least 105 raol of alkylene oxide per mole of alkoxylatable NH group and too high a molar ratio of propylene oxide to ethylene oxide of from 1.9 to 4:1 (or conversely too small a molar ratio of ethylene oxide to propylene oxide of from 0.53 to 0.25).<br>
JP-A-2003-020585 describes the use of alkoxylated polyethylenimines in deinking processes. As well as polyethylenimines which are preferably exclusively ethoxylated or else initially ethoxylated and then alkoxylated randomly with an ethylene oxide/propylene oxide mixture, a product is also disclosed which is based on a polyethylenimine of average molecular weight Mw 600 and has been reacted initially with 100 mol of ethylene oxide and then with 100 mol of propylene oxide per mole of alkoxylatable NH group and thus likewise with a very much larger amount of alkylene oxide than hi the case of the inventive polyethylenimines.<br>
Finally, EP-A-359 034 discloses assistants for the preparation and stabilization of nonaqueous pigment dispersions which are based on at least two polyethylenimines comprising polyalkylene oxide blocks. When polyethylenimines which have an outer block of a higher alkylene oxide are used, they are always initially ethoxylated and then butoxylated compounds, some of which contain a small intermediate polypropylene oxide block. Polyethylenimines which have an inner polyethylene oxide block and an outer polypropylene oxide block are always additionally reacted with at least one mol per mole of active NH group of an oc-olefin oxide (α-C12/C14-, C16/C18- or C20-C28-olefin oxide).<br><br>
It is an object of the invention to provide polymers which are suitable as an additive to laundry detergents and cleaning compositions for removing greasy soil from textile and hard surfaces. In particular, the polymers should also exhibit good greasy soil-detaching action even at low washing temperatures.<br>
Accordingly, amphiphilic water-soluble alkoxylated polyalkylenimines of the general formula I:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R are identical or different, linear or branched C2-C6-alkylene radicals;<br>
B is a branch;<br>
E is an alkylenoxy unit of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
R1 is 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene and/or 1,2-isobutylene;<br>
R2 is ethylene;<br>
R3 is 1,2-propylene;<br>
R4 are identical or different radicals: hydrogen; C1-C4-alkyl;<br>
x, y, z are each from 2 to 150, where the sum of x+y-fz means a number of alkylenimine<br>
units which corresponds to an average molecular weight Mw of the polyalkylenimine<br>
before the alkoxylation of from 300 to 10 000;<br>
m is a rational number from 0 to 2;<br>
n is a rational number from 6 to 18;<br>
p is a rational number from 3 to 12, where 0.8 ≤, n/p ≤ 1.0 (x+y+z)l/2;<br>
and quaternization products thereof have been found.<br>
An essential property of the inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines is their amphiphilicity, i.e. they have a balanced ratio of hydrophobic and hydrophilic structural elements and are thus firstly hydrophobic enough to absorb on greasy soil and to remove them together with the surfactants and Ihe remaining washing components of the laundry detergents and cleaning compositions, but secondly also-hydrophilic enough to keep the detached greasy soil in the washing and cleaning liquor and prevent it from resettling on the surface.<br>
This effect is achieved by the alkoxylated polyalkylenimines having an inner polyethylene oxide block and an outer polypropylene oxide block, the degree of ethoxylation and the degree of propoxylation not going above or below specific limiting values, and their ratio being at least 0.8 and within a range whose upper limit according to the empirically found relationship n/p ≤ 1.0 (x+y+z)1/2 is determined by the molecular weight of the polyalkylenimine used.<br>
The inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimmes have a basic skeleton which comprises primary, secondary and tertiary amine nitrogen atoms which are joined by alkylene radicals R and are in the form of the following moieties in random arrangement:<br>
primary amino moieties which terminate the main chain and the side chains of the basic skeleton and whose hydrogen atoms are subsequently replaced by alkylenoxy units:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
secondary amino moieties whose ydrogen atom is subsequently replaced by alkylenoxy units: tertiary amino moieties which branch the main chain and the side chains: Before the alkylation, the polyalkylenimine has an average molecular weight Mw of from 300 to 10000. The sum x+y+z of the repeating units of the primary, secondary and tertiary amino moieties means a total number of alkylenimine units which corresponds to these molecular weights.<br>
The molecular weight Mw of the polyalkylenimine is preferably from 500 to 7500 and more preferably from 1000 to 6000.<br>
The R radicals connecting the amine nitrogen atoms may be identical or different, linear or branched C2-C6-alkylene radicals. A preferred branched alkylene is 1,2-propylene. A particularly preferred alkylene radical R is ethylene.<br>
Since cyclizations are possible in the formation of the basic polyalkylenimine skeleton, it is also possible for cyclic amino moieties to be present to a small extent in the basic skeleton and they are of course alkoxylated in the same way as the noncyclic primary and secondary amino moieties.<br>
The hydrogen atoms of the primary and secondary ammo groups of the basic polyalkylenimine skeleton are replaced by alkylenoxy units of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
In this formula, the variables are each defined as follows:<br>
R1 is 1,2-propylene, 1,2-butylene or 1,2-isobutylene, preferably 1,2-propylene;<br>
R2 is ethylene;<br>
R3 is 1,2-propylene;<br>
R4 is hydrogen or C1-C4-alkyl, preferably hydrogen;<br>
m is a rational number of 0 to 2; when m = 0, preferably about 1;<br>
n is a rational number from 6 to 18;<br>
p is a rational number from 3 to 12, where 0.8 ≤ n/p ≤ 1.0 (x+y+z)1/2.<br>
n and p are preferably defined as follows:<br>
n is a rational number from 7 to 15;<br>
p is a rational number from 4 to 10, where 0.9 ≤ n/p ≤ 0.8 (x+y+z)1/2.<br>
n and p are more preferably each defined as follows:<br>
n is a rational number from 8 to 12;<br>
p is a rational number from 5 to 8, where 1.0 ≤ n/p ≤ 0.6 (x+y+z)l/2.<br>
The substantial part of these alkylenoxy units is formed by the ethylenoxy units -(R2-O)n-and the propylenoxy units -(R3-O)P-.<br>
The alkylenoxy units may additionally also have a small proportion of propylenoxy or butylenoxy units -(R'-O)m-, i.e. the polyalkylenimine may be reacted initially with small amounts of up to 2 mol, especially from 0.5 to 1.5 mol, in particular from 0.8 to 1.2 mol, of propylene oxide or butylene oxide per mole of NH moiety present, i.e. incipiently alkoxylated.<br>
This modification of the polyalkylenimine allows, if necessary, the viscosity of the reaction mixture in the alkoxylation to be lowered. However, the modification generally does not influence the performance properties of the alkoxylated polyalkylenimine and therefore does not constitute a preferred measure.<br>
The inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines may also be quaternized. A suitable degree of quaternization is up to 50%, in particular from 5 to 40%. The quaternization is effected preferably by introducing C1-C4-alkyl groups and may be undertaken in a customary manner by reaction with corresponding alkyl halides and dialkyl sulfates.<br>
The quaternization may be advantageous in order to adjust the alkoxylated polyalkylenimines to the particular composition of the laundry detergent and cleaning composition in which they are to be used, and to achieve better compatibility and/or phase stability of the formulation. The alkoxylated polyalkylenimines are preferably not quaternized.<br>
The inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines may be prepared in a known manner.<br>
One preferred procedure consists in initially undertaking only an incipient alkoxylation of the polyalkylenimine in a first step.<br>
In this step, the polyalkylenimine is reacted only with a portion of the total amount of ethylene oxide used, which corresponds to about 1 mol of ethylene oxide per mole of NH moiety or, when the polyalkylenimine is to be modified initially with up to 2 mol of propylene oxide or butylene oxide per mole of NH moiety, here too initially only with up to 1 mol of this alkylene oxide.<br>
This reaction is undertaken generally in the absence of a catalyst in aqueous solution at from 70 to 200°C, preferably from 80 to 160°C, under a pressure of up to 10 bar, in particular up to 8 bar.<br>
In a second step, the further alkoxylation is then effected by subsequent reaction i) with the remaining amount of ethylene oxide or, in the case of a modification by higher alkylene oxide in the first step, with the entirety of ethylene oxide and ii) with propylene oxide.<br>
The further alkoxylation is undertaken typically in the presence of a basic catalyst. Examples of suitable catalysts are alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide and calcium hydroxide, alkali metal alkoxides, in particular sodium and potassium C1-C4-alkoxides, such as sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide and potassium tert-butoxide, alkali metal and alkaline earth metal hydrides such as sodium hydride and calcium hydride, and alkali metal carbonates such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. Preference is given to the alkali metal hydroxides and the alkali metal alkoxides, particular preference being given to potassium hydroxide and sodium hydroxide. Typical use amounts for the base are from 0.05 to 10% by weight, in<br><br>
particular from 0.5 to 2% by weight, based on the total amount of polyalkylenimine and alkylene oxide.<br>
The further alkoxylation may be undertaken in substance (variant a)) or in an organic solvent (variant b)). The process conditions specified below may be used both for the ethoxylation and for the subsequent propoxylation.<br>
In variant a), the aqueous solution of the incipiently alkoxylated polyalkylenimine obtained in the first step, after addition of the catalyst, is initially dewatered. This can be done in a simple manner by heating to from 80 to 150°C and distilling off the water under a reduced pressure of from 0.01 to 0.5 bar. The subsequent reaction with the alkylene oxide is effected typically at from 70 to 200°C, preferably from 100 to 180°C, and at a pressure of up to 10 bar, in particular up to 8 bar, and a continued stirring time of from about 0.5 to 4 h at from about 100 to 160°C and constant pressure follows in each case.<br>
Suitable reaction media for variant b) are in particular nonpolar and polar aprotic organic solvents. Examples of particularly suitable nonpolar aprotic solvents include aliphatic and<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, cyclohexane, toluene and xylene. Examples of particularly suitable polar aprotic solvents are ethers, in particular cyclic ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and dioxane, N,N-diaIkylamides such as dimethylformamide and dimethylacetamide, and N-alkyllactams such as N-methylpyrrolidone. It is of course also possible to use mixtures of these aprotic solvents. Preferred solvents are xylene and toluene.<br>
In variant b) too, the solution obtained in the first step, after addition of catalyst and solvent, is initially dewatered, which is advantageously done by separating out the water at a temperature of from 120 to 180°C, preferably supported by a gentle nitrogen stream. The subsequent reaction with the alkylene oxide may be effected as in variant a).<br>
In variant a), the alkoxylated polyalkylenimine is obtained directly in substance and may be converted if desired to an aqueous solution. In variant b), the organic solvent is typically removed and replaced by water. The products may of course also be isolated in substance.<br>
The inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines, as a 1% by weight solution in distilled water, have a cloud point of generally ≤ 70°C, preferably ≤ 65°C. The cloud point is more preferably in the range from 25 to 55°C.<br>
The inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines are outstandingly suitable as a soil detachment-promoting additive for laundry detergents and cleaning compositions. They exhibit high dissolving power especially in the case of greasy soil. It is of particular advantage that they display the soil-detaching power even at low washing temperatures.<br>
The likewise inventive laundry detergents and cleaning compositions comprise generally from 0.05 to 10% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight and more preferably from 0.25 to 2.5% by weight, based on the particular overall composition, of the inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines. In addition, the laundry detergents and cleaning compositions generally comprise surfactants and, if appropriate, further polymers as washing substances, builders and further customary ingredients, for example cobuilders, complexing agents, bleaches, standardizes, graying inhibitors, dye transfer inhibitors, enzymes and perfumes.<br>

Example 9 - Use of inventive alkoxylated polyalkylenimines in laundering<br>
To test their soil release performance, the alkoxylated polyalkylenimines were added to the wash liquor in three series of experiments together with the surfactants and builders specified in table 1, as model laundry detergents, or with a commercially available laundry detergent. The test cloths recited in table 2 were then washed under the washing conditions specified in tables 3a, 4a and 5a.<br>
Soil release from the test cloths was determined by subjecting the test cloths to a reflectance measurement at 460 nm before and after the wash. Soil removal was computed from the reflectance values R before and after the wash and also the reflectance value of a white reference cotton fabric by the following formula, in %:<br>
R (after wash) - R (before wash)<br>
Soil removal [%] =	———	 x 100<br>
R (white cotton) - R (before wash)<br>
All washes were carried out 2 x. The soil removal values reported under the wash results in tables 3b, 4b and 5b correspond to the average of the measured values obtained under the same conditions. The values respectively obtained without added polymer are reported for comparison.<br>
All amounts used are based on 100% active substance. Table 1: Surfactants and builder<br><br>
