				<td>CHEMO-ENZYMATIC SYNTHESIS OF OFHC ALLY ENSfCflffiD ROSE-OXHWES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the systhesis of optically enriched dextro- and laevo-rotatory isomers of rose oxide from racemic citronellol. The invention particularly relates to the preparation of optically enriched (-) - (2 S, 4 R) - rose oxide and its isomer (+)- (2 R, 4 S)- rose oxide from racemic citronellol. Background of the invention<br>
Natural rose oxide, a minor though essential olfactive, organoleptic constituent of Bulgarian rose and Geranium bourbon oils consists of mainly (-)-(2 S, 4 R)-2-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)- 4-methyl tetrahydropyran. Natural rose oxide is a mixture of both cis-and trans-rose oxides wherein the cis-isomer is the major component. Rose oxides were first isolated from rose oil [Seidel and Stall, Helv. Chem. Acta. 42, 1830, (1959)]. It was later found to be also an essential constituent of oil of Geranium bourbon [Seidel et al, Helv. Chem. Acta. 44, 598(1961)].<br>
Rose oxide is normally manufactured from citronellol which occurs in Java citromlla oil. Java citronetta is abundantly available raw material and its oil has significant industrial application in perfumery. Synthetically racemic citronellol is made from nerol/geraniol or citral by their hydrogenation. These monoterpenes are abundantly available from the natural sources. An elegant and economically feasible synthesis of racemic citronellol starts from dihydromyrcene (3,7-dimethyl-octa-l,6-diene) which can be obtained from the readily available a-or p-pinenes via hydrogenation and subsequent pyrolysis.<br>
Although there are numerous ways to synthesize rose oxides, most of the presently known routes involve acid-catalysed cyclisation of (E)-3,7-dimethyl-5-octen-l,7-diol produced in various ways from citronellol [Ohloff G and Lienhard, Helv. Chem Acta. 48, 182 (1962)]. Ohloff prepared (E)-3,7-dimethyl-5-octen-l,7-diol by the photosensitized air oxidation of citronellol to give alkyl hydroperoxide which on reduction and subsequent cyclisation with an acid gave a mixture of cis- and trans- rose oxide. Eschinasi prepared [Eschinasi E.H., J.Org. Chem. 35, 1097 (1970)] rose oxide mixture by the acid-catalysed cyclisation of (E)-8-acetoxy-2,6-dimethyl-l,3-octadiene obtained from the pyrolysis of 2,6-dimethyl-2,3,8-triacetoxy octane.<br>
In 1984, a total synthesis of cis-rich (2S, 4 R)-rose oxide was carried out by P.Audin, et.al using chiral catalysts which is more of an academic interest [Audin, P; Douthean, A; Gore, J; Bull. Soc. Chem. Fr. 1984, 7, D-297-H 306],<br><br>
!NO prior art is available in the literature concerning the preparation of optically enriched dextro- and laevo-rotatory isomers of rose oxides from racemic citronellol using biocatalytic methods. Objects of the invention<br>

Step 5: Preparation of d-(+)-2-ethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-3-octen-8-oI.<br>
The compound d-(+)-8-acetoxy-2-ethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-3-octene (2.6g, 10.7mmole) is dissolved in methanol (30 ml) and to this is added sodium hydroxide (2.0 g) and refluxed on a water bath for 1 h. Methanol is then removed by distillation under reduced pressure. The<br><br>
prsd«ot is *ken redtesolved in sekrest ^etfeer {50 «il), weshed wk-h ^afcer pH,   dried over anhydrous   sodium sulphate and concentrated to give an oily substance identified as d-(+)-2-ethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-3-octen-8-ol, the structure  of which is confirmed by spectral data (2.0 g, 94% ). Step-6: Preparation of l-(-) -rose oxide<br>
The compound l-(-)-2-ethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-3-octen-8-ol (5.0g, 25 mmole) was dissolved in acetone (100 ml) in a round bottom flask and to this added a mixture of acetic acid - sulphuric acid (9:1 , 3 ml) at 0° and stirred the solution for 5 hr. After the completion of the reaction the reaction product is poured over water and extracted with solvent ether. The solvent layer is then washed with water to neutral pH and dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate. The solvent is removed under vacuum. The crude product thus obtained is purified over a silica gel column with gradient elution using hexane: ethyl acetate mixture (95:5 to 90:10) as eluents. The oily substance thus obtained is identified as l-(-)-rose oxide by spectral studies (3.35 g, 87%)[a]26 D-35° (CHC13, c 1.0) Step-7: Preparation of d-(+)-rose oxide<br>
The compound d-(+)-2-ethoxy-2,6-dimethyl-3-octen-8-ol (2.0 g,  10    m mole) is cyclised by acetic acid- sulphuric acid mixture (9:1) as discussed in step 6 to give d-(+)-rose oxide (1.45 g, 87.8%), [a]26 D+17 (CHC13 c 1.0). Advantages<br>
