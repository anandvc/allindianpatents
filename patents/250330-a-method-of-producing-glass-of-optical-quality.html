				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>A method of producing glass of optical quality<br>
The invention relates to a method of producing glass of<br>
optical quality, by melting or, optionally by purifying a<br>
presintering composition, and to applying said method to<br>
depositing an optionally purified presintering composition<br>
on an optical fiber preform, in which a substantially-<br>
cylindrical preform that extends in a longitudinal<br>
direction is set into rotation about its axi s in front of a<br>
plasma or a flame which moves back and forth substantially<br>
parallel to the longitudinal direction of the preform, and<br>
in which a first feed duct feeds grains of a presintering<br>
composition.<br>
In known manner, a preform is obtained by chemical vapor<br>
deposition implemented inside a tube mounted on a<br>
glassmaker's lathe, and which is subjected to a collapsing<br>
operation to form a solid preform.<br>
For multimode fibers, that way of making preforms suffices.<br>
However, for monomode fibers it is advantageous to add<br>
material to the preform in order to increase its diameter<br>
and thus obtain, during fiber drawing, a continuous fiber<br>
that is several tens of kilometers .long.<br>
Material is added to the preform by means of a plasma<br>
torch. The preform is cylindrical in shape and it is set<br>
into rotation about its axis in front of the torch whose<br>
plasma is fed with grains of material, like a presintering'<br>
composition.<br>
The grains are melted and then deposited and vitrified on<br>
the preform. A plurality of passes are performed to build<br>
up to the desired diameter.<br>
Depositing material, like a presintering composition<br>
suffers from a major drawback. Alkali elements such as<br>
sodium or lithium are present in non-negligible quantities<br>
in this type-of material, and they arc present in the<br>
deposited grains, thereby encouraging the formation of<br>
bonds between the OH group and the dopant elements, such as<br>
germanium (Ge). Such bonds are absorbent at certain<br>
wavelengths, thereby increasing the attenuation losses of<br>
the optical fiber at said wavelengths.<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method of<br>
purifying a presintering composition.<br>
Subject of the invention is a method of producing glass of<br>
optical quality by melting, or optionally by purifying a<br>
presintering composition in which a plasma or a flame from<br>
a heat energy supply moans is fed by a first feed duct with<br>
grains of a presintering composition, wherein optionally a<br>
second feed duct feeds the plasma or flame with a fluorine<br>
or chlorine compound (preferably a fluorine compound) mixed<br>
with a carrier gas, the feed conditions of the two ducts<br>
are adjusted to cause alkali or alkaline-earth elements<br>
contained in the presintering composition grains to react<br>
with the fluorine or the chlorine (preferably the fluorine)<br>
of the fluorine or chlorine compound (preferably a fluorine<br>
compound).<br>
The object of the invention is also to apply the method of<br>
purifying a presintering composition to depositing a<br>
presintering composition on an optical fiber preform, the<br>
deposit containing only a very small quantity of alkali or<br>
alkaline-earth elements.<br>
The subject of the invention also provides a method of<br>
depositing a presintering composition on optical devices,<br>
in which a preform extending in a longitudinal direction is<br>
set into move, preferred rotation about its axis in front<br>
of a plasma or flame coming from a heat energy supply means<br>
which moves back and forth substantially parallel to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the preform, and in which a first<br>
feed duct feeds the plasma or the flame with grains of a<br>
presintering composition, wherein optionally a second feed<br>
duct feeds the plasma or flame with a fluorine or chlorine<br>
compound (preferably a fluorine compound) mixed with a<br>
carrier gas, the feed conditions of the two ducts being<br>
adjusted to cause alkali or alkaline- earth elements<br>
contained in the grains of a presintering composition to<br>
react with the fluorine or the chlorine (preferably the<br>
fluorine) of the fluorine or chlorine compound (preferably<br>
a fluorine compound).<br>
Optical devices can be optical fiber form, crucibles,<br>
accessories, rod, high temperature resistcnt materials,<br>
glass preforms and/or optical lenses.<br>
The plasma or flame is the seat of a chemical reaction in<br>
which the molten presintering composition react with the<br>
fluorine or chlorine compound of the carrier gas.<br>
Advantageously, the temperature of the plasma can be<br>
adjusted to obtain high efficiency in the reaction, given<br>
the feed rates of the ducts feeding the carrier gas and for<br>
feeding the presintering composition. A higher temperature<br>
makes it possible to maintain good reaction efficiency<br>
while increasing the feed rates of the feed ducts.<br>
Also advantageously, it is possible to adjust the content<br>
of the fluorine or chlorine compound (preferably a fluorine<br>
compound) in the carrier gas as a function of the mean size<br>
of the presintering composition. Smaller granules make it<br>
possible to maintain good reaction efficiency with a<br>
carrier gas that is less rich in the fluorine or chlorine<br>
compound (preferably a fluorine compound).<br>
By eliminating alkaline elements from the deposit of a<br>
presintering composition, it is possible to build up the<br>
optical devices using a starting material that is much less<br>
expensive.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will<br>
appear on reading the following description of an example.<br>
The method of melting or purifying a presintering<br>
composition makes it possible to deposit one or more layers<br>
of a presintering composition on optical devices and that<br>
contain only negligible amounts of alkali elements such as<br>
sodium or lithium, or of alkaline-eart elements.<br>
The deposition operation, also known as a building-up<br>
operation, serves to increase the diameter of a preform, to<br>
enable a continuous fiber to be drawn therefrom that is<br>
several tens of kilometers long.<br>
The method comprises a plasma torch including electrical<br>
inductor components.<br>
A preform in the form of a cylinder extends in a<br>
longitudinal direction I, and is caused to rotate about its<br>
axis as indicated by arrow.<br>
The plasma torch moves back and forth substantially<br>
parallel to the longitudinal direction of the preform. The<br>
preform is rotated by a glassmaker's lathe. The chucks of<br>
the lathe drive two glass rods which are welded to the two<br>
ends of the preform. The lathe is placed in an enclosed box<br>
that provides protection against electromagnetic radiation<br>
and against gaseous discharges from the chemical reaction.<br>
A first feed duct delivers grains of a presintering<br>
composition to the plasma.<br>
The feed is performed merely by gravity. A valve is placed<br>
outside the box to allow the feed rate to be adjusted. <br>
A second feed duct feeds the plasma with a gas that conveys<br>
a given content of a fluorine or chlorine compound, and<br>
preferably of a fluorine compound. The carrier gas is<br>
preferably air. The fluorine compound is, for example,<br>
sulfur hexafluoride SF6, or a Freon selected from those<br>
authorized under European regulations, such as C2F6. The<br>
chlorine compound may be chlorine gas Cl2, for example. A<br>
valve connected to a gas supply placed outside the box<br>
serves to adjust the carrier gas flow rate. Another valve<br>
connected to the gas supply serves to adjust the content of<br>
fluorine or chlorine compound in the carrier gas. The<br>
carrier gas may be constituted solely by the fluorine or<br>
chlorine compound, preferably a fluorine compound, in the<br>
pure state.<br>
The plasma is the seat of a chemical reaction between the<br>
presintering composition grains and the fluorine or<br>
chlorine, preferably fluorine compound. The temperature of<br>
the plasma lies in the range 5000 °C. to 10,000 °C,<br>
causing the presintering composition grains Lo mull. The<br>
fluorine or chlorine compounds react with the alkali-<br>
elements such as sodium or lithium that are present in the<br>
presintering composition, causing the fluorides NaF or Li.F<br>
or the chlorides NaCl or LiCl to be given off in gaseous<br>
form.<br>
Good reaction efficiency is obtained under the following<br>
operating conditions:<br>
plasma power 40 kw to 100 kW<br>
presintering composition 0.2 kg/h to 5 kg/h<br>
flow rate<br>
carrier gas flow rate 0 to 15 liters/min<br>
fluorine compound content in 0.3 % to 100 %<br>
carrier gas.<br>
In a preferred subject of the invention the presintering<br>
composition can be granules of metaloxides or<br>
metalloidoxides, which can be prepared by dispersing the<br>
metaloxides or metalloidoxides in water, spray drying it<br>
and heating the granules obtained at a temperature of from<br>
150 to 1.100 °C for a period of 1 to 8 h.<br>

The chief process for the preparation of pyrogenic silicon<br>
dioxide, starting from silicon tetrachloride which is<br>
reacted in mixture with hydrogen and oxygon, is known from<br>
Ullmanns Enzyklopadie dor technischen Chemi.e, 4th edition,<br>
Vol. 21, pp. 464 et seg. (1982).<br>
The metal oxide or metalloid oxide to be used accordingly<br>
to the invention can be granules based on pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide powder with<br>
a BET surface area of 30 to 90 rn2/g,<br>
a DBP index of 80 or less<br>
a mean aggregate area of .less than 25000 nm2,<br>
a mean aggregate circumference of less than 1000 nra,<br>
wherein at least 70% of the aggregates have a<br>
circumference of less than 1300 nm. This pyrogenically<br>
produced silicon dioxide is disclosed in WO<br>
2004/054929.<br>
The BET surface area may preferably be between 35 and<br>
75 m2/g. Particularly preferably the values may be between<br>
40 and 60 m2/g. The BET surface area is determined in<br>
accordance with DIN 66131.<br>
The DBP index may preferably be between 60 and 80. During<br>
DBP absorption, the take-up of force, or the torque (in<br>
Nm), of the rotating blades in the DBP measuring equipment<br>
is measured while defined amounts of DBP are added,<br>
comparable to a titration. A sharply defined maximum,<br>
followed by a drop, at a specific added amount of DBP is<br>
then produced for the powder according to the .invention.<br>
A silicon dioxide powder with a BET surface area of 40<br>
to 60 m2/g and a DBP index of 60 to 80 may be particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Furthermore, the silicon dioxide powder t;o be used<br>
according to the invention may preferably have a mean<br>
aggregate area of at most 20000 nm2. Particularly<br>
preferably, the mean aggregate area may be between 15000<br>
and 20000 nm2. The aggregate area can be determined, for<br>
example, by image analysis of TEM images. An aggregate is<br>
understood to consist of primary particles of similar<br>
structure and size which have intergrown with each other,<br>
the surface area of which is .less than the sum of the<br>
individual isolated primary particles. Primary particles<br>
are understood to be the particles which arc initially<br>
formed in the reaction and which can grow together to form<br>
aggregates as the reaction proceeds further.<br>
A silicon dioxide powder with a BET surface area of 40 to<br>
60 m2/g, a DBP index of 60 to 80 and a mean aggregate area<br>
between 15000 and 20000 nm2 may be particularly preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the silicon dioxide powder to be<br>
used according to the invention may have a mean aggregate<br>
circumference of less than 1000 nm. Particularly<br>
preferably, the mean aggregate circumference may be between<br>
600 and 1000 nm. The aggregate circumference can also be<br>
determined by image analysis of TEM images.<br>
A silicon dioxide powder with a BET surface area of 40 to<br>
60 m2/g, a DBP index of 60 to 80, a mean aggregate area<br>
between 15000 and 20000 nm2 and a mean aggregate<br>
circumference between 600 and 1000 nm may be particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Furthermore, it may be preferable for at least 80%,<br>
particularly preferably at least 90%, of the aggregates to<br>
have a circumference of less than 1300 nm.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the silicon dioxide powder to be<br>
used according to the invention may assume a degree of<br>
filling in an aqueous dispersion of up to 90 wt.%. The<br>
range between 60 and 80 wt. % may be particularly preferred.<br>
Determination of the maximum degree of filling in an<br>
aqueous dispersion is performed by the incorporation of<br>
powder, in portions, into water using a d.issolver, without<br>
the addition of other additives. The maximum degree of<br>
filling is achieved when either no further powder is taken<br>
up into the dispersion, despite elevated stirring power,<br>
i.e. the powder remains in dry form on the surface of the<br>
dispersion, or the dispersion becomes solid or the<br>
dispersion starts to form lumps.<br>
Furthermore, the silicon dioxide powder to be used<br>
according to the invention may have a viscosity at a<br>
temperature of 23°C, with respect to a 30 wt.% aqueous<br>
dispersion at a rate of shear of 5 rpm, of less than 100<br>
mPas. In particularly preferred embodiments, the viscosity<br>
may be less than 50 mPas.<br>
The pH of the silicon dioxide powder to be used according<br>
to the invention may be between 3.8 and 5, measured in a 4%<br>
aqueous dispersion.<br>
The process for preparing the silicon dioxide powder to be<br>
used according to the invention, is characterised in that<br>
at least one silicon compound in the vapour form, a fr.ee-<br>
oxygen-containing gas and a combustible gas are mixed in a<br>
burner of known construction, this gas mixture is igni ted<br>
at the mouth of the burner and is burnt in the flame tube<br>
of the burner, the solid obtained is separated from the gas<br>
mixture and optionally purified, wherein<br>
the oxygen content of the f rec-oxygen-contai ni.ng gas is<br>
adjusted so that the lambda value is greater than or<br>
equal to 1,<br>
the gamma-value is between 1.2 and 1.8,<br>
the throughput is between 0.1 and 0.3 kg SiOz/m3 of core<br>
gas mixture,<br>
the mean normalised rate of flow of gas in the flame<br>
tube at the level of the mouth of the burner is at least<br>
5 m/s .<br>
The oxygen content of the free-oxygen-containing gas may<br>
correspond to that of air. That is, in this case air is<br>
used as a free-oxygen-containing gas. The oxygen content<br>
may, however also take on higher values. In a preferred<br>
manner, air enriched with oxygen should have an oxygon<br>
content of not more than 4 0 vol.%.<br>
Lambda describes the ratio of oxygen supplied in the core<br>
to the stoichiometrically required amount of oxygen. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, lambda lies within the range<br>
1 
Gamma describes the ratio of hydrogen supplied in the core<br>
to the stoichiometrically required amount of hydrogen. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, gamma lies within the range<br>
1.6 
The normalised rate of flow of gas refers to the rate of<br>
flow at 273 K and 1 atm.<br>
A burner of known construction is understood to be a burner<br>
with concentric tubes. The core gases are passed through<br>
the inner tube, the core. At the end of the tube, the mouth<br>
of the burner, the gases are ignited. The inner tube is<br>
surrounded by at least one other tube, the sleeve. The<br>
reaction chamber, called the flame tube, starts at the<br>
level of the mouth of the burner. This .is generally a<br>
conical tube, cooled with water, which may optionally be<br>
supplied with other gases (sleeve gases) such as hydrogen<br>
or air.<br>
The mean, normalised rate of flow of the gas in the flame<br>
tube at the level of the mouth of the burner of at least 5<br>
m/s refers to the rate of flow immediately alter the<br>
reaction mixture leaves the burner. The rate of flow is<br>
determined by means of the volume flow of the reaction<br>
products in vapour form and the geometry of the flame tube.<br>
The core gases are understood to be the gases and vapours<br>
supplied to the burner, that is the free-oxygen-containing<br>
gas, generally air or air enriched with oxygen, Ihe<br>
combustible gas, generally hydrogen, methane or natural<br>
gas, and the silicon compound or compounds in vapour form.<br>
An essential feature of the process is that the mean<br>
normalised rate of flow of gas in the flame tube at the<br>
level of the mouth of the burner is at least 5 m/s. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the mean normalised rate of flow of<br>
the gas in the flame tube at the level of the mouth of the<br>
burner assumes values of more than 8 m/s.<br>
The mean rate of discharge of the gas mixture (feedstocks)<br>
at the mouth of the burner is not limited. However, it has<br>
proven to be advantageous when the rate of discharge aL the<br>
mouth of the burner is at least 30 m/s.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, additional air (secondary air)<br>
may be introduced into the reaction chamber, wherein the<br>
rate of flow in the reaction chamber may be raised further.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the mean normalised race of flow<br>
of gas in the flame tube at the level of the mouth of the<br>
burner may be 8 to 12 m/s.<br>
The type of silicon compound used in the process is not<br>
further restricted. Silicon tetrachloride and/or at least<br>
one organochlorosilicon compound may preferably be used.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment of the process i s one<br>
in which<br>
silicon tetrachloride is used,<br>
- the lambda value is such that 1 
the gamma-value is between 1.6 and 1.8,<br>
- the throughput is between 0.1 and 0.3 kg Si02/rn3 of core<br>
gas mixture,<br>
in addition at least double the amount of air, with<br>
respect to the amount of free-oxygen-containing gas<br>
introduced into the burner, is .introduced into the flame<br>
tube and<br>
the rate of flow of the gas of feedstocks at the mouth<br>
of the burner is 40 to 65 m/s (with respect to standard<br>
conditions)<br>
and the mean normalised rate of flow of gas in the flame<br>
tube at the level of the mouth of the burner is between<br>
8 and 12 m/s.<br>
In general during the preparation of pyrogenic oxides, the<br>
rate of flow of gas in the water-cooled reaction chamber<br>
(flame tube) and in the subsequent cooling unit (cooling<br>
stretch) is adjusted in such a way that the best possible<br>
cooling power, that is to say rapid cooling of the reaction<br>
products, is ensured. In principle, it is true that the<br>
cooling power increases with decreasing rate of flow of<br>
gas. The lower limit is simply based on the requirement of<br>
still being able to transport the product through the pipes<br>
with the gas stream.<br>
It was demonstrated in the process that although a<br>
considerable increase in the rate of flow of gas in the<br>
reaction chamber resulted in a reduced cooling power, .it<br>
led to a powder with unexpected properties. Whereas<br>
physical characteristics such as BET surface area and DBP<br>
absorption are substantially unchanged as compared with<br>
powders according to the prior art, the powder exhibits a<br>
much lower structure.<br>
Furtheron the metal oxide or metalloid oxide to be used<br>
according to the invention can be granules based on<br>
pyrogenically produced silicon dioxide which is<br>

or less.<br>
The process for the preparation of the high-purity<br>
pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxide .is characterised in<br>

flame by means of high-temperature hydrolysis to give<br>

The metal content of the silicon dioxide according to the<br>
invention is within the ppm range and below (ppb range).<br>
Examples<br>
The BET surface area is determined in accordance with DIN<br>
66131.<br>
The dibutyl phthalate absorption is measured with a<br>
RHEOCORD 90 instrument made by Haake, Karlsruhe. For this<br>
purpose, 16 g of the silicon dioxide powder, weighed out to<br>
an accuracy of 0.001 g, is placed in a mixing chamber, this<br>
is sealed with a lid and dibutyl phthalate is added at a<br>
pre-set rate of addition of 0.0667 m.l/s via a hole in the<br>
lid. The mixer is operated with a motor speed of 125 revs<br>
per minute. After reaching maximum torque, the mixer and<br>
DBP addition are automatically switched off. The DBP<br>
absorption is calculated from the amount of DBP consumed<br>
and the amount of particles weighed out in accordance with:<br>
DBP index (g/100 g) = (DBP consumed in g / initial weight<br>
of particles in g) x 100.<br>
A programmable rheometer for testing complex flow<br>
behaviour, equipped with a standard rotation spindle, was<br>
available for determining the viscosity.<br>
Rate of shear: 5 to 100 rpm<br>
Temperature of measurement: room temperature (23°C)<br>
Concentration of dispersion: 30 wt.%<br>
Procedure: 500 ml of dispersion are placed in a 600 ml<br>
glass beaker and tested at room temperature (statistical<br>
recording of temperature via a measuring sensor) under<br>
different rates of shear.<br>
Determination of the compacted bulk density is based on DIN<br>
ISO 787/XI K 5101/18 (not sieved).<br>
Determination of the pH is based on DIN ISO 787/IX, ASTM D<br>
1280, JIS K 5101/24.<br>
The image analyses were performed us.i ng a TEM instrument<br>
H 7500 made by Hitachi and a CCD camera MegaView II, made<br>
by SIS. Image magnification for evaluation purposes was<br>
30000 : 1 at a pixel density of 3.2 nm. The number of<br>
particles evaluated was greater than 1000. Preparation was<br>
in accordance with ASTM 384 9-89. The lower threshold limit<br>
for detection was 50 pixels.<br>
Determining the maximum degree of filling .in an aqueous<br>
dispersion: 200 g of fully deionised water were initially<br>
placed in a 1 1 vessel (diameter about 11 cm). A dissolver<br>
from VMA-Getzmann, model Dispermat® CA-40-C with a<br>
dissolver disc, diameter about 65 mm, was used as the<br>
dispersing unit.<br>
At the start, the dissolver is operated at about 650 rpm.<br>
The powder is added in portions of about 5 g. After each<br>
addition, there is a waiting period until the powder has<br>
been completely incorporated into the suspension. Then the<br>
next portion is added. As soon as incorporation of an added<br>
amount of powder takes longer than about 10 s, the speed of<br>
the dissolver disc is increased to 1100 rpm. Then further<br>
stepwise addition is performed. As soon as incorporation of<br>
an added amount of powder takes longer than about 10 s, the<br>
speed of the dissolver disc is increased to 1700 rpm.<br>
The maximum degree of filling' is ach.i.eved when either no<br>
further powder is taken up by the dispersion, despite<br>
increased stirring power, i.e. the powder remains in dry<br>
form on the surface of the dispersion, or the dispersion<br>
becomes solid or the dispersion starts to form lumps.<br>
The amount of powder added can be determined by difference<br>
weighing (preferably difference weighing of the powder<br>
stock). The maximum degree of filling is calculated as:<br>
Maximum degree of filling = amount of powder added<br>
[g]/(amount of powder added [g] + amount of water initially<br>
introduced [g]) x 100%<br>
Example 1 (comparison example):<br>
500 kg/h SiCl4 arc vaporised at about 90°C and transferred<br>
to the central tube of a burner of known construction. 14 5<br>
Nra3/h of hydrogen and 207 Nm3/h of air with an oxygen<br>
content of 35 vol.% are also introduced into this tube.<br>
This gas mixture is ignited and burnt in the flame tube of<br>
the water-cooled burner. The mean normalised rate of flow<br>
of gas in the flame tube at the level of the mouth of the<br>
burner is 0.7 m/s. After cooling the reaction gases, the<br>
pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder is separated from the<br>
hydrochloric acid-containing gases using a filter and/or a<br>
cyclone. The pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder is treated<br>
with water vapour and air in a deacidification unit.<br>
Examples 2 to 4 (comparison examples) are performed in the<br>
same way as example 1. The parameters which are altered<br>
each time are given in Table 1.<br>
Example 5 (working example):<br>
400 kg/h SiCl4 are vaporised at about 90°C and transferred<br>
to the central tube of a burner of known construction.<br>
195 NmVh of hydrogen and 303 Nm3/h of air with an oxygen<br>
content of 30 vol.% are also introduced into this tube.<br>
This gas mixture is ignited and burnt in the flame tube of<br>
the water-cooled burner. The mean normalised rate of flow<br>
of gas in the flame tube at the level of the mouth of the<br>
burner is 10 m/s. After cooling the reaction gases, the<br>
pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder is separated Prom the<br>
hydrochloric acid-containing gases using a filter and/or a<br>
cyclone. The pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder is treated<br>
with water vapour and air in a deacidification unit.<br>
Examples 6 to 8 are performed in the same way as described<br>
in example 1. The parameters which are altered each time<br>
are given in Table 1.<br>
The analytical data for powders 1 to 8 are given in<br>
Table 2.<br>
The powders according to the examples 5 to 8 exhibit much<br>
lower values for mean aggregate area, mean aggregate<br>
circumference and maximum and minimum aggregate diameter<br>
and thus much less structure than the powders in comparison<br>
examples 1 to 4.<br>
The powders according to the example 5 to 8 also have a<br>
much higher maximum degree of filling and a much lower<br>
viscosity in an aqueous dispersion.<br>

Table 3 are evaporated at approx. 90°C and transferred into<br>
the central tube of a burner of known design. 190 Nm /h<br>
hydrogen as well as 326 Nm3/h air having a 35 vol.% oxygen<br>
content are introduced additionally into this tube. This<br>
gas mixture is ignited and burns in the flame tube of the<br>
water-cooled burner. 15 Nm3/h hydrogen are introduced<br>
additionally into a jacket nozzle surrounding the central<br>
nozzle, in order to prevent baking-on. 250 Nm3/h air of<br>
normal composition are moreover introduced additionally<br>
into the flame tube. After cooling of the reaction gases<br>
the pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder is separated by means<br>
of a filter and/or a cyclone from the hydrochloric acid-<br>

order to remove adherent hydrochloric acid. The nctal<br>
contents are reproduced in Table 5.<br>

hydrogen as well as 32 6 Nm3/h air having a 35 vol.% oxygen<br>
content are introduced additionally into this tube. This<br>
gas mixture is ignited and burns in the flame tube of the<br>
water-cooled burner. 15 Nrn3/h hydrogen are introduced<br>
additionally into a jacket nozzle surrounding the central<br>
nozzle, in order to prevent baking-on. 250 Nm3/h a.i.r of<br>
normal composition are moreover introduced additionally<br>
into the flame tube. After cooling of the reaction gases<br>
the pyrogenic silicon dioxide powder is separated by means<br>
of a filter and/or a cyclone from the hydrochloric acid-<br>

Measuring method<br>
The pyrogenically prepared silicon dioxides which are<br>
obtained are analysed as to their metal content. The<br>
samples are dissolved in an acid solution which comprises<br>
predominantly HF.<br>
The Si02 reacts with the HF, forming SiF4 + H20. The SiF4<br>
evaporates, leaving behind completely in the acid the<br>
metals which are to be determined. The individual samples<br>
are diluted with distilled water and analysed agains: an<br>
internal standard by inductively coupled plasma-atomic<br>
emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) in a Perkin Elmer Optima<br>
3000 DV. The imprecision of the values is the result of<br>
sample variations, spectral interferences and the<br>
limitations of the measuring method. Larger elements have a<br>
relative imprecision of -I- 5%, while the smaller elements<br>
have a relative imprecision of +_ 15%.<br>
In the above example, the choice of a plasma torch does not<br>
restrict the generality of the method which can also be<br>
implemented by any other moans for delivering heat energy<br>
and creating a temperature greater than 100 °C. , and in<br>
particular by means of a flame from a combustion device.<br>
