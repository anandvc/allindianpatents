				<td>4-Pyridyl- and 2,4-pyrimidinyl-substituted pyrrole derivatives and their use in pharmacy<br>
The present invention relates to 4-pyridyl- and 2,4-pyrimidinyl-substituted pyrrole derivatives having immunomodu-lating and cytokine release-inhibiting action, pharmaceutical compositions which contain these compounds, and their use in pharmacy.<br>
Pharmacologically active pyrrolizine compounds which inhibit 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (Cox-1 and Cox-2) are already known.<br>
For example, pyrrolizine compounds having anti-inflammatory activity are described in Arch. Pharm. 319, 231-234 (1986),<br>
318,	661-663 (1985), 318, 663-664 (1985), 319, 500-505 (1986),<br>
319,	749-755 (1986), 327, 509-514 (1994), 330, 307-312 (1997), and in J. Med. Chem. 1987, 30, 820-823 and 1994, 37, 1894-1897. The most promising compound of this type is the 6-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-phenyl-2,3-dihydropyrrolo[1,2-a]pyrrole com¬pound ML 3000, see Drugs of the Future, 1995, 20, (10).: 1007-10 09. It suppresses the release of leukotrienes, thromboxanes and prostaglandins. The inhibitory action on the formation of the leukotrienes and the prostaglandins is balanced in this structure, harmful effects of a pure inhibitory action on cy-clooxygenase -1 and -2 (Cox-1 or Cox-2) with increased forma¬tion of leukotrienes are not observed here. In all these com¬pounds, the 1-position of the pyrrolizine structure is unsub-stituted.<br>
WO 95/32970, WO 95/32971 and WO 95/32972 relate to compounds of the formula,<br><br><br>
where<br>
one or two of the radicals R1, R2 and R3 can be a mono- or bicyclic, aromatic, heterocyclic radical which has at least one oxygen, sulfur and/or nitrogen atom. These compounds have anti-inflammatory action.<br>
Further fused pyrrole compounds and structurally similar com¬pounds are described in US 5,260,451, US 4,546,100 and US 4,584,297; US 4,684,658; US 5,631,122; US 3,920,672; US 4,536,512; US 5,552,422; US 4,539,400; US 4,719,218; EP 608 133 A, DE 198 45 446 A, PCT/EP 99/09057 and DE 100 01 166. It is not disclosed that these compounds have immunomodulating or cytokine release-inhibiting action.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain fused pyrrole compounds which have a 4-pyridyl substituent on the pyrrole ring have immunomodulating and/or cytokine release-inhibiting action.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to the 4-pyridyl- and 2,4-pyrimidinyl-substituted pyrrole derivatives and their use in pharmacy, of the formula I<br><br><br><br>
and the optical isomers, physiologically tolerable salts and physiologically easily hydrolyzable esters thereof.<br>
In the present case, the physiologically tolerable salts can be acid addition salts or base addition salts. For acid addi¬tion salts inorganic acids are used, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, or organic acids, such as tartaric acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, ma¬lic acid, mandelic acid, ascorbic acid, gluconic acid and the like.<br>
Base addition salts include salts of the compounds of the for¬mula I with inorganic bases, such as sodium or potassium hydro-<br><br>
xide, or with organic bases, such as mono-, di- or trietha-nolamine.<br>
Physiologically easily hydrolyzable esters of the compounds of the formula I are, for example, alkyl, pivaloyloxymethyl, ace-toxymethyl, phthalidyl, indanyl and methoxymethyl esters.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention have asymmetric centers, racemates and optical isomers (enantiomers, diaste-reomers) are included.<br>
The expression "Ci-C6-alkyl" includes straight-chain or bran¬ched alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-, i- or t- butyl, sec-butyl, n-pentyl and n-hexyl.<br>
The expression "halogen" includes a fluorine, chlorine, bromi¬ne or iodine atom and in particular a fluorine or chlorine atom.<br>
If the second of the radicals R1, R2 and R3 is phenyl, this is preferably substituted by a halogen atom, in particular a flu¬orine atom. Preferably, the halogen atom is situated in the 4-position.<br>
If the second of the radicals R1, R2 and R3 is thienyl, this is preferably bonded in the 2-position. If the 2-thienyl group is substituted, it is preferably substituted with a halogen atom and in particular in the 5-position.<br>
The preparation of the compounds according to the invention is carried out according to various processes, depending on the position of the aromatic radicals and depending on the nature of the heteroaromatic radicals R1, R2 and R3.<br>
The [a]-heterocyclically fused pyrrole compounds, in which X = S, or 0, are prepared analogously to the processes described in WO 95/32970, WO 95/32971 and WO 95/32972.<br><br>
Examples 23 and 24 describe how 5H-furan-2-one precursors are condensed with the acetic acid salts of aminoalcohols to give l-hydroxyalkyl-2-pyrrolones, which afford the [a] -hetero-cyclically fused pyrrole compounds with suitable condensing agents {here P2S5 or methanesulfonyl chloride) (scheme 1).<br><br><br>
In .this case, a pyridine or pyrimidine radical can be introdu¬ced on the one hand via the munchnone/sydnone component, on the other hand via the dipolarophile component. The dipolaro-philes used are dehydrocinnamic acid esters, 3-substituted acetylenecarboxylic acid esters, 2-halogen-substituted cinnamic acids or 2-haloacrylates and nitrostyre-nes.<br>
In the group consisting of the pyrrolizines, N-acyl derivati¬ves of proline (pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, cf. examples 1-9, 19, 20, 22) are employed for sydnone formation, in the group consisting of the thiazolo[2,1-b]pyrroles (cf. examples 10 - 14) the N-acyl derivatives of [1,3]-thiazolidine-2-carboxylic acid) are used and in the group consisting of the indolizines N-acyl derivatives of the homologous piperidine-2-carboxylic acid (cf. examples 15-18) are used.<br>
For example, the cycloaddition of ethyl 2-bromo-3-(4-pyridyl)-propenoate to   the in situ-generated miinchnone of N-(4-fluoro-benzoyl)proline to give the ester from example 1, of ethyl 2-bromo-3- (4-f luorophenyl) propenoate to the miinchnone of N-(isonicotinoyl)proline to give the ethyl ester of the pyrro-lizinecarboxylic acid of example 19 and the cycloaddition of an ethyl 2-fc&gt;romo-3-(4-fluorophenyl)propenoate to the intramo-lecularly cyclized 3-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-[1,3]-thiazol-idine-2-carboxylic acid leads to the pyrrolizine compound from example 10.<br>
By the use of 1-nitrostyrenes and N-aroylproline, 7-(or 1-) unsubstituted 5,6- (or 2,3-)diarylpyrrolizine compounds are obtained directly.<br>
The reaction of l-fluoro-4-(2-nitrovinyl)benzene with 1-pyridine-4-carbonylpyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (N-isonicotinoyl-proline) leads to the compound from example 22.<br>
Pyridine and pyrimidine substituents can also be introduced subsequently into the activated pyrrole positions of the pyr-<br><br>
rolizines and indolizines and their thia and oxa analogs (schemes 3 and 4). The reaction of 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-7-methyl-2,3-dihydro-lH-pyrrolizine with the reactive 1-ethoxycarbonyl-pyridinium chloride obtained from ethyl chloro-formate and pyridine affords the compound of example 21 (R1 = CH3, R2 = 4-f luorophenyl) .<br>
Scheme 3<br><br>
In particular the 3-amino-2,4-pyrimidine substituent can be synthesized starting from the acyl derivatives of the monoa-ryl-substituted compounds via condensation with dimethylforma-mide dimethyl acetal and guanidine (scheme 5). The 3-amino-2,4-pyrimidine substituent can be introduced ac¬cording to this method into each reactive, unsubstituted posi¬tion of the pyrrole ring of the pyrrolizidine and indolizidine system.<br><br><br>
The compounds according to the invention show in vitro and in vivo immunomodulating and cytokine release-inhibiting action. They are thus suitable for the treatment of disorders which are connected with a disturbance of the immune system. For ex¬ample, they are utilizable for the treatment of autoimmune di¬seases, cancer, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, septic shock, adult respiratory distress syn¬drome, and in transplantations.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be administered either as individual therapeutic active compounds or as mixtu¬res with other therapeutic active compounds. They can be admi¬nistered as such, but in general they are administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions, i.e. as mixtures of the active compounds with suitable pharmaceutical carriers or di¬luents . The compounds or compositions can be administered orally or parenterally, but preferably they are given in oral dosage forms.<br>
The type of pharmaceutical composition and of pharmaceutical carrier or diluent depends on the desired type of administra¬tion. Oral compositions can be present, for example, as ta¬blets or capsules and can contain customary excipients, such<br><br>
as binders (e.g. syrup, acacia, gelatin, sorbitol, tragacanth or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (e.g. lactose, sugar, corn¬starch, calcium phosphate, sorbitol or glycine), lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc, polyethylene glycol or sili¬ca), disintegrants (e.g. starch) or wetting agents (e.g. sodi¬um lauryl sulfate). Oral liquid preparations can be present in the form of aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups, elixirs or sprays etc. or as dry powders for reconsti-tution with water or another suitable carrier. Liquid prepara¬tions of this type can contain customary additives, for examp¬le suspending agents, flavorings, diluents or emulsifiers. For parenteral administration, solutions or suspensions with cu¬stomary pharmaceutical carriers can be employed.<br>
The compounds or compositions according to the invention can be administered to a mammal {human or animal) in doses of ap¬proximately 0.5 mg to approximately 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. They can be administered in an individual dose or in a number of doses. The spectrum of action of the com¬pounds was investigated with the aid of the following test sy¬stems .<br>
In vitro test procedure using human whole blood<br>
Human potassium-EDTA whole blood {at 400 [il]   is preincubated with test substance for 15 min. at 37°C in a C02 incubator (5% C02; 95% moisture-saturated air). The samples are then stimula¬ted for 4 hours with 1 /zg/ml of LPS (E.coli   026 :B6) at 37QC in a C02 incubator (5% C02,- 95% moisture-saturated air). The reac¬tion is ended by placing the samples on ice, addition of DPBS buffer and subsequent centrifugation (1000 x g; 15 min). The plasma supernatant is used for the quantification of IL-ip and THFa by means of ELISA.<br><br>
In vitro teat procedure using PBMCs<br>
The mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are isolated from human potassi-um-EDTA whole blood diluted 1:3 by means of density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque -1.077). After 2 washing steps with DPBS buffer, the mononuclear cells are resuspended in macro-phage-SFM medium and adjusted to a cell count of 1 x 10s cells/ml.<br>
The PBMCs suspension (at 390 fil)   is preincubated with test substance for 15 min at 37°C in a C02 incubator (5% C02; 95% moisture-saturated air). The samples are subsequently stimula¬ted for 4 hours with 1 jig/ml LPS (E.coli 026-.B6) at 37°C in a C02 incubator (5% C02, 95% moisture-saturated air). The reac¬tion is ended by placing the samples on ice, addition of DPBS buffer and centrifugation (15880 x g; 12 min). The supernatant is used for the quantification of IL-lp and TNFcc by means of ELISA.<br>
In vitro test system for determining the inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase<br>
Human granulocytes are used as a source of the 5-lipoxygenase. LTB4 (leukotriene B4) is formed from endogenous arachidonic acid by means of stimulation with calcium ionophore A 23187. The granulocytes are isolated and the enzyme reaction is car¬ried out according to known processes (see Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. 330, 307 - 312 (1997)).<br>
The blood, which is protected from clotting with heparin, is centrifuged on a discontinuous Percoll® gradient and the gra¬nulocyte layer is pipetted off. After lysis of the erythrocytes, the granulocytes are washed a number of times and then adjusted to a specific cell count. The enzyme reac¬tion is then started with calcium ionophore A 23187 in the presence or absence of the test substance after addition of Ca2+. The synthesis of the leukotrienes is stopped after<br><br>
1.5 minutes. The samples are centrifuged off and the superna¬tant is diluted. LTB4 is determined quantitatively by means of ELISA.<br>
In vitro test system for determining the inhibition of cy-clooxygenase-1<br>
In this test system, the amount of prostaglandin E2 formed from human platelets after addition of calcium ionophore is determined by means of ELISA. In this process, the platelets are obtained after centrifugation on a discontinuous Percoll® gradient. The enzyme reaction and the determination of the me¬tabolites formed is carried out in principle as in the deter¬mination of 5-lipoxygenase inhibition. Differences exist with respect to the incubation time. Furthermore, the addition of a thromboxane synthesis inhibitor is necessary (see Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. 330, 307 - 312 (1997)).<br>
In vitro test system for determining the inhibition of cy-clooxygenase-2<br>
COX2 {from sheep placenta) is preincubated at 4°C with test substance for 10 min, then stimulated with arachidonic acid (5 fiM)   at 25°C for 10 min. Diclofenac is used as a reference (IC50(COX2) = 3.0 10"6 M) . The determination is carried out at 3 dilutions (10-7, 10~6, 10"5 M) . The PGE2 concentrations are quantified by means of ELISA (see Mitchell J.A. et al., Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. 90: 11693-11697 (1993)).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

Bromocarbethoxymethylenetriphenylphosporane (9.0 g, 21 mmol) is dissolved in toluene (60 ml) with the exclusion of light and then a solution of isonicotinaldehyde (4-pyridinecarbaldehyde, 2.14 g, 2 0 mmol) in toluene (9 ml) is added. The batch is stirred in the dark at RT for 16 h. The solution is then concentrated in vacuo, the residue is dige¬sted with ether (40 ml) and the ether phase is filtered off with suction from the crystalline solid. The crystals are washed a further 2 times with ether {10 ml) and the collected ether solutions are concentrated in vacuo. The residue which remains {6.63 g) is purified by column chromatography {cc) on A1203 using an ether/n-hexane mixture (2:1).

d) Ethyl 3-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-pyridyl)-6,7-dihydro-5H-pyrrolizine-1-carboxylate<br>
N-(4-Fluorobenzoyl)proline (9.48 g, 40 mmol) is suspended in acetic anhydride (60 ml), raised to a temperature of 80°C in a reflux apparatus under argon until a clear solution is ob¬tained (20 min), then treated dropwise with ethyl 2-bromo-3-(4-pyridyl)acrylate (12.28 g, 8 mmol) in toluene (10 ml) (8 min) and the reaction vessel is immersed in a prepared hot oil bath (120°C). The dark mixture is heated under reflux for 21 h, whereupon starting material is no longer detectable by tic (Ala03; ethyl acetate/n-hexane 1:1}. The reaction solution is cooled and treated with ethyl acetate (50 ml), and the or¬ganic supernatant is poured off. The solid deposited in the flask is digested 2 times with ethyl acetate (30 ml) in the presence of heat. Supernatant and ethyl acetate solutions are combined and concentrated in vacuo. The residue is taken up in ethyl acetate (200 ml) and the ethyl acetate phase is washed until neutral with water (100 ml) , NaHC03 solution (100 ml) and water again (100 ml), dried (Na2S04 sice.) and concentrated. A pale beige solid crystallizes from the concentrated ethyl ace¬tate phase (30 ml). After filtering off with suction, washing (ethyl acetate) and after drying, 2.93 g of the product sought remain.<br>
After concentrating the mother liquor, a further 2.1 g of a crystallizate are obtained which is a mixture of product and by-product.<br>
