				<td>Method for the Production of Dual Phase Sheet Steel<br>
Technical Field<br>
Dual phase galvanized steel strip is made utilizing a thermal profile involving a<br>
two-tiered isothermal soaking and holding sequence. The strip is at a temperature<br>
close to that of the molten metal when it enters the coating bath.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Prior to the present invention, the galvanizing procedure whereby steel strip is<br>
both heat treated and metal coated has become well known and highly developed.<br>
Generally a cold rolled steel sheet is heated into the intercritical regime (between<br>
Ac1 and AC3) to form some austenite and then cooled in a manner that some of the<br>
austenite is transformed into martensite, resulting in a microstructure of ferrite and<br>
martensite. Alloying elements such as Mn, Si, Cr and Mo are in the steel to aid<br>
in martensite formation. Various particular procedures have been followed to<br>
accomplish this, one of which is described in Omiya et al US Patent 6,312,536.<br>
In the Omiya et al patent, a cold rolled steel sheet is used as the base for hot dip<br>
galvanizing, the steel sheet having a particular composition which is said to be<br>
beneficial for the formation, under the conditions of the process, of a<br>
microstructure composed mainly of ferrite and martensite. The Omiya et al<br>
patent describes a galvanized dual phase product.<br>
According to the Omiya et al patent, a dual phase galvanized steel sheet is made<br>
by soaking the cold rolled steel sheet at a temperature of 780°C (1436°F) or<br><br>
above, typically for 10 to 40 seconds, and then cooling it at a rate of at least 5°C<br>
per second, more commonly 20-40°C per second, before entering the galvanizing<br>
bath, which is at a temperature of 460°C (860T). The steel, according to the<br>
Omiya et al patent, should have a composition as follows, in weight percent:<br><br>
The Omiya et al patent is very clear that an initial heat-treating (soaking) step is<br>
conducted at a temperature of at least 780°C (1436°F). See column 5, lines 64-<br>
67; col 6, lines 2-4: "In order to obtain the desired microstructure and achieve<br>
stable formability, it is necessary to heat the steel sheet at 780°C or above, which<br>
is higher than the Ac1 point by about 50°C. ... Heating should be continued for<br>
more than 10 seconds so as to obtain the desired microstructure of ferrite +<br>
austenite." The process description then goes on to say the steel sheet is cooled<br>
to the plating bath temperature (usually 440-470°C, or 824-878oF) at an average<br>
cooling rate greater than 1°C/second, and run through the plating bath. After<br>
plating, cooling at a rate of at least 5°C/second will achieve the desired<br>
microstructure of predominantly ferrite and martensite. Optionally, the plated<br>
sheet may be heated prior to cooling, in an alloying procedure (often called<br>
galvannealing) after metal coating but prior to the final cooling.<br>
Omiya et al clearly do not appreciate that it is possible to achieve a dual phase<br>
product without the high temperatures of their soaking step, or that a particular<br><br>
holding step following a lower temperature soak can facilitate the desired<br>
microstructure formation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is<br>
 found, contrary to the above quoted recitation in the Omiya et al patent,<br>
that not only is it not necessary to maintain the initial heat treatment temperature<br>
at 780°C (1436°F) or higher, but that the desired dual phase microstructure can be<br>
achieved by maintaining the temperature during an initial heat treatment (soaking)<br>
in the range from AC1+45°F, but at least 1340°F (727°C), to AC1+135°F, but no<br>
more than 1425°F (775°C). One does not need to maintain the temperature at<br>
780°C or higher, contrary to the Omiya et al patent, provided the rest of my<br>
procedure is followed. For convenience hereafter, my initial heat treatment will<br>
be referred to as the "soak." However, my process does not rely only on a lower<br>
temperature for the soak as compared to Omiya et al; rather, the soak temperature<br>
of (AC1+45°F) to 1425°F, usually 1340-1420°F, must be coupled with a<br>
subsequent substantially isothermal heat treatment, termed the holding step, in the<br>
range of 850-920oF (454-493°C). In the holding step, the sheet is maintained at<br>
850-920°F (454-493°C), sometimes herein expressed as 885°F±35°F, for a period<br>
of 20 to 100 seconds, before cooling to room (ambient) temperature. Cooling to<br>
ambient temperature should be conducted at a rate of at least 5°C per second. It<br>
is important to note, once again, that the Omiya et al patent says nothing about a<br>
holding step at any temperature or for any time in their thermal process.<br>
Furthermore, my work has shown that if a steel as defined in the Omiya et al<br>
patent is soaked within Omiya's defined, higher, soaking range (for example<br>
1475°F) and further processed through a thermal cycle including a holding step as<br>
described herein (850-920F), the resultant steel will not achieve the desired<br>
predominantly ferrite-martensite microstructure but will contain a significant<br>
amount of bainite and/or pearlite.<br><br>
I express the lower temperature limit of the soak step as "Ac1+45°F, but at least<br>
1340°F (727°C)", because virtually all steels of Composition A will have an Ac1<br>
of at least 1295°F.<br>
The steel sheet should have a composition similar to that of the Ochiya et al<br>
patent:<br>
Carbon:	0.02-0.20	Aluminum: 0.010-0.150<br>
Titanium: 0.01 max	Silicon: 0.04 max<br>
Phosphorous: 0.060 max	Sulfur: 0.030 max<br>
Manganese: 1.5-2.40	Chromium: 0.03-1.50<br>
Molybdenum:0.03-1.50	with the provisos that the amounts of<br>
manganese, chromium and molybdenum should have the relationship:<br>
Mn + 6Cr + 10 Mo: at least 3.5%<br>
For my purposes, the silicon content may be as much as 0.5%, and, preferably,<br>
carbon content is 0.03-0.12% although the Omiya et al carbon range may also be<br>
used. This composition, as modified, may be referred to hereafter as<br>
Composition A.<br><br>
Thus this invention is a method of making a dual phase steel sheet comprising<br>
soaking a steel sheet at a temperature of in the range from Ac1+45°F, but at least<br>
1340°F (727°C), to Ac1+135°F, but no more than 1425°F (775°C), for a period of<br>
20 to 90 seconds, cooling the sheet at a rate no lower than l°C/second to a<br>
 temperature of 454-493°C, and holding the sheet at temperatures in the range of<br>
850-920°F (454-493°C) for a period of 20 to 100 seconds. The holding step may<br>
be prior to the hot dip or may begin with the hot dip, as the galvanizing pot will be<br>
at a temperature also in the range 454-493°C (850-920°F). Immediately after the<br>
holding step, whether or not the sheet is galvanized, the sheet can be cooled to<br>
ambient temperature at a rate of at least 5°C/second. Alternatively, after the sheet<br>
is coated, the sheet may be galvannealed in the conventional manner - that is, the<br>
sheet is heated for about 5-20 seconds to a temperature usually no higher than<br><br>
about 960°F and then cooled at a rate of at least 5°C/second. My galvannealed<br>
and galvanized thermal cycles are shown for comparison in Figure 6.<br>
The actual hot dip step is conducted more or less conventionally that is, the steel<br>
is contacted with the molten galvanizing metal for about 5 seconds; while a<br>
shorter time may suffice in some cases, a considerably longer time may be used<br>
but may not be expected to result in an improved result. The steel strip is<br>
generally about 0.7 mm thick to about 2.5 mm thick, and the coating will typically<br>
be about 10µm. After the holding and coating step, the coated steel may be cither<br>
cooled to ambient temperature as described elsewhere herein or conventionally<br>
galvannealed, as described above. When the above protocol is followed, a<br>
product having a microstructure comprising mainly ferrite and martensite will be<br>
obtained.<br>
Commercially, it is common to perform hot dip galvainizing substantially<br>
contiunously by using coils of steel strip, typically from 1000 to 6000 feet long.<br>
My invention permits more convenient control over the process not only because<br>
the soak step takes place at a lower temperature, but also because the strip may be<br>
more readily kept at the same temperature as the hot dip vessel entering and<br>
leaving it, with little concern about significant heat transfer occurring between<br>
steel strip and zinc pot that could heat up the molten zinc and limit production.<br>
As applied specifically to a continuous steel strip galvanizing line, which includes<br>
a strip feeding facility and a galvanizing bath, my invention comprises feeding a<br>
cold rolled coil of steel strip of Composition A to a heating zone in the<br>
galvanizing line, passing the strip through a heating zone continuously to heat the<br>
strip to within the range of AC1+45°F, but at least 1340°F (727°C), to AC1+35°F,<br>
but no more than 1425°F (775°C), passing the strip through a soaking zone to<br>
maintain the strip within the range of AC1+45°F, but at least 1340°F (727°C), to<br>
Ao+135°F, but no more than 1425°F (775°C), for a period of 20 to 90 seconds,<br>
passing the strip through a cooling zone to cool the strip at a rate greater than<br><br>
l°C/second, discontinuing cooling the strip when the temperature of the strip has<br>
been reduced to a temperature in the range 885°F±35°F, but also ± 30 degrees F<br>
of the temperature of the galvanizing bath, (preferably within 20 degrees F ± the<br>
temperature of the bath, and more preferably within 10 degrees F ± the<br>
temperature of the bath), holding the strip within 30 degrees F of the temperature<br>
of the galvanizing bath (again preferably within 20 degrees F ± Ihe temperature of<br>
the bath, and more preferably within 10 degrees F ± the temperature of the bath)<br>
for a period of 20 to 100 seconds, passing the strip through the galvanizing bath,<br>
optionally galvannealing the coated strip, and cooling the strip to ambient<br>
temperature. The galvanizing bath is typically at about 870°F (850-920°F), and<br>
may be located at the beginning of the holding zone, or near the end of the hold<br>
zone, or anywhere else in the holding zone, or immediately after it. Residence<br>
time in the bath is normally 3-6 seconds, but may vary somewhat, particularly on<br>
the high side, perhaps up to 10 seconds. As indicated above, after the steel is<br>
dipped into and removed from the zinc bath, the sheet can be heated in the<br>
conventional way prior to cooling to room temperature to form a galvanneal<br>
coating, if desired.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows the general thermal cycle of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows ultimate tensile strength as a function of soak temperature and<br>
hold time in connection with the discussion of Example 1.<br>
Figure 3 shows the yield ratio as a function of soak temperature.<br>
In Figure 4, the effect is shown of soak temperature on yield ratio under the<br>
conditions described in Example 2.<br><br>
for both the 35 and 70 second holding zones for the samples. Note that a very low<br>
yield ratio of about 0.45 is achieved over a range of temperatures for both curves<br>
from about 1350-1430°F, indicating optimum dual phase properties over this soak<br>
temperature range. Metallographic analyses of the samples performed on steels<br>
soaked within this 1350-1430°F soak range confirmed a ferrite-martensite<br>
microstructure. Quantitative metallography using point counting techniques<br>
revealed martensite contents of 14.5 and 13.5% respectively, for the steel soaked<br>
at 1390 and held at 880°F for 70 and 35 seconds, respectively, with no other<br>
constituents observed in the microstructure. (The images were constructed using<br>
the Lepera etching technique for which ferrite appears light gray, martensite<br>
white, and such as pearlite and bainite appearing black). For soak temperatures<br>
below about 1350°F, as expected, iron carbide (Fe3C) remains in the<br>
microstructure due to insufficient carbide dissolution which results in limited<br>
martensite formation during cooling.<br>
Unexpected, however, is the appearance of bainite in the microstructure when<br>
soak temperatures get above about 1430°F. For example, metallographic analyses<br>
reveal a bainite content of 8.5% for the steel soaked at 1510°F and held at 880°F<br>
for 70 seconds. These results contrast strongly with Omiya. According to Omiya,<br>
it is in this soak temperature range, i.e. necessarily above 1436°F, that a ferrite-<br>
martensite microstructure should be expected. My work indicates that a<br>
significant amount of bainite is present in the microstructure when the annealing<br>
soak temperature is in the Omiya recommended range and a hold zone in the<br>
vicinity of 880°F is present in the thermal process. For the particular steel used<br>
in this example, the necessary annealing range for ferrite-martensite<br>
microstructures is from about 1350 to 1430°F. Table 1 summarizes the<br>
relationships between the thermal process, yield ratio and microstructural<br>
constituents for this example at the different soak temperature regimes.<br><br>
Another graph of yield ratio is shown in Figure 5, pertaining to the conditions<br>
described in Example 3.<br>
A paradigm of the thermal cycle of my invention is shown in Figure 6.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Example 1<br>
Samples of steel sheet were processed, with various "soak" temperatures<br>
according to the general thermal cycle depicted in Figure 1 — one set of samples<br>
followed the illustrated curve with a 35 second "hold" at 880°F and the other set<br>
of samples were held at 880°F for 70 seconds. The samples were cold rolled<br>
steel of composition A as described above - in particular, the carbon was 0.67,<br>
Mn was 1.81, Cr was 0.18 and Mo was 0.19, all in weight percent. The other<br>
elemental ingredients were typical of low carbon, Al killed steel. Soak<br>
temperatures were varied in increments of 20°F within the range of 1330 to<br>
1510°F. After cooling, the mechanical properties and microstructures of the<br>
modified samples were determined. Ultimate tensile strength ("UTS") of the<br>
resulting products as a function of soak temperature and hold time is shown in<br>
Figure 2. For this particular material, a minimum UTS of 600 MPa was the target<br>
and was achieved over a range of soak temperatures from about 1350°F to 1450°F<br>
for both hold times.<br>
A goal of Example 1 was to achieve a predominantly ferrite-martensite<br>
microstructure. The yield ratio, i.e. the ratio of yield strength to ultimate tensile<br>
strength, is an indication whether or not a dual phase ferrite-martensite<br>
microstructure is present. When processed as in Example 1, a ferrite-martensite<br>
microstructure is indicated when the yield ratio is 0.5 or less. If the yield ratio is<br>
greater than about 0.5, a significant volume fraction of other deleterious<br>
constituents such as bainite, pearlite, and/or Fe3C may be expected in the<br>
microstructure. Figure 3 shows the yield ratio as a function of soak temperature<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
A different cold rolled sheet steel of Composition A was subjected to the same set<br>
of thermal cycles a described in Example 1 and shown in Figure 1. This steel<br>
also lay within the stated composition range, in this case specifically containing<br>
the following, in weight percent: 0.12%C, 1.96%Mn, 0.24%Cr, and 0.18%Mo,<br>
and the balance of the composition typical for a low carbon Al-killed steel. Once<br>
again, the mechanical properties of the material were measured. The effect of<br>
soak temperature on yield ratio for this steel for the 70 second holding sequence at<br>
880°F is shown in Figure 4. This curve exhibits a shape similar to the curve_s in<br>
Figure 3, with metallographic analyses revealing identical metallogical<br>
phenomena occurring at the different soak temperature regimes as in the previous<br>
example. Also as demonstrated in the previous example, the annealing soak<br>
temperature range necessary for a predominantly ferrite-martensite microstructure<br>
to be obtained is from about 1350 to 1425°F when a hold step is conducted at<br>
about 880°F.<br>
Example 3<br>
As in the previous two examples, a third cold-rolled steel of Composition A was<br>
processed according to the set of thermal cycles shown in Figure 1. This steel<br>
contained, in weight percent, 0.076C, 1.89 Mn, O.lOCr, 0.094 Mo, and 0.34 Si, the<br>
balance of which is typical for a low carbon steel. After annealing as in the other<br>
examples, the mechanical properties and resultant microstructures were again<br><br>
determined. Figure 5 shows the yield ratio of this material as a function of soak<br>
temperature for the holding time of 70 seconds. Once again, a curve having a<br>
shape similar to the previous examples is observed, with a precise annealing range<br>
over which the dual phase ferrite-martensite microstructure is achieved.<br>
However, note that the curve appears to be shifted to the right about 30°F as<br>
compared to the previous examples. This is due to the fact that the Acl<br>
temperature is higher for this steel as compared to the steels in the previous two<br>
examples due to the higher silicon. Table 2 shows the necessary soak temperature<br>
range for ferrite-martensite formation for each of the steels along with their<br>
respective Acl temperature according to Andrews. The preferred annealing range<br>
appears to be a function of the Acl temperature as shown. Generically, based on<br>
this information, the soak temperature range necessary for dual phase production<br>
depends on the specific steel composition - that is, it should lie within the range<br>
from Ac1+45°F, but at least 1340°F (727°C), to AC1+135°F, but no more than<br>
1425°F (775°C) when a holding step in the vicinity of 880° (885°F±35°F) is<br>
present in the thermal cycle.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Table 3 shows the resultant mechanical properties of two additional steels having<br>
carbon contents lower than shown previously. They were processed as described<br>
in Figure 1 utilizing the individual soak temperatures of 1365, 1400, and 1475°F,<br>
respectively and a hold time of 70 seconds at 880°F. Also shown within the table<br>
are the expected necessary soak temperature ranges for dual phase steel<br>
production for each steel as calculated from Ac1 as described in Example 3. Note<br><br>
that for the 1365 and 1400°F soak temperatures, which reside within the desired<br>
soak temperature range for both respective steels, low yield ratios characteristic of<br>
ferrite-martensite microstructures are observed. Furthermore, for the steels<br>
soaked at 1475°F, which is outside the range present invention, the yield ratio is<br>
significantly higher due to the presence of bainite in the microstructure.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
The previous examples were based on laboratory work, but mill trials have also<br>
taken place that have verified the aforementioned thermal processing scheme for<br>
the production of both hot-dipped galvanized and galvannealed dual phase steel<br>
product. Table 4 shows the results of mill trials for galvannealed steel. Note that<br>
the steels shown in the table have virtually the same composition and thus similar<br>
Ac1 temperatures. From the Ac1 temperature, the expected soak temperature range<br>
for dual phase formation is calculated to be about 1350 to 1440°F. Furthermore,<br>
in terms of processing, hold temperatures and times arc fairly consistent among<br>
the steels and the annealing (soak) temperature is the main processing variable<br>
difference between the materials. The mechanical properties are also shown in<br>
the table along with corresponding yield ratios. Note that steels 1 through 4 were<br>
soaked within the soaking range of the invention and exhibited the expected yield<br>
ratio of less than 0.5. Metallographic examination revealed the presence of ferrite<br>
martensite microstructures for steels 1 through 4 with martensite contents of about<br>
15%. Steel 5 was processed outside of the preferred soaking range and exhibited<br>
a relatively high yield ratio of about 0.61. Metallographic analysis showed a<br><br>
bainite content of 11% in this material. Similar results have been shown for<br>
galvanize as well as galvanneal processing.<br><br><br>
