Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to celiuloiytic protein compositions for degrading or converting cellulose-containing material and methods of producing and using the compositions.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Cellulose is a polymer of the simple sugar glucose covalently bonded by beta-1,4-linkages. Many microorganisms produce enzymes that hydrolyze beta-linked glucans. These enzymes include endoglucanases, cellobiohydroiases, and beta-glucosidases. Endoglucanases digest the cellulose polymer at random locations, opening it to attack by cellobiohydroiases. Cellobiohydroiases sequentially release molecules of cellobtose from the ends of the cellulose polymer. Cellobiose is a water-soluble beta-1,4-linked dimer of glucose. Beta^iucosidases hydrolyze cellobiose to glucose.<br>
The conversion of cellulosic feedstocks into ethanol has the advantages of the ready availability of large amounts of feedstock, the desirability of avoiding burning or land filling the materials, and the cleanliness of the ethanol fuel. Wood, agricultural residues, herbaceous crops, and municipal solid wastes have been considered as<br>
 <br>
feedstocks for ethanol production. These materials primarily consist of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Once the cellulose is converted to glucose, the glucose Is easily fermented by yeast into ethanol.<br>

In a preferred aspect, h<br>
 <br>
mixture of CELLUCU^ST® 1.5L (Novozymes A/S, Bagsvsrd, Denmark) In the presence of 3% Aspergillus oryzae beta-glucosidase (recombinantly produced in Aspergillus oryzae according to WO 02/095014) or 3% Aspergillus fumigatus beta-glucpsldase (recombinantly produced In Aspergillus oryzae according to Example 22 of WO 02/095014) of cellulase protein loading Is used as a standard of the cellulolytic activity.<br>
The polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity have at least 20%, preferably at least 40%, more preferably at least 50%, more preferably at least 60%, more preferably at least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, even more preferably at least 90%, most preferably at least 95%, and even most preferably at least 100% of the cellulolytic enhancing activity of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2,4,6, 8,10,12, or 14.<br>
The polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity enhance the hydrolysis of a cellulose'Containing material catalyzed by proteins having cellulolytic activity by reducing the amount of cellulolytic enzyme required to reach the same degree of hydrolysis preferably at least 0.1-fold, more at least 0.2-fold, more preferably at least 0.3-fold, more preferably at least 0.4-fold, more preferably at least 0.5-fold, more preferably at least 1-fold, more preferably at least 3-fold, more preferably at least 4-fold, more preferably at least 5-fold, more preferably at least 10-fold, more preferably at least 20-fold, even more preferably at least 30-fold, most preferably at least SO-fokJ, and even most preferably at least 100-fold.<br>

For short probes of about 15 nucleotides to about 70 nucleotides in length, stringency conditions are defined as prehybridization, hybridization, and washing post-hybridization at about 5'C to about 10'C below the calculated Tm using the calculation according to Bolton and McCarthy (1962, Proceedings of ttie National Academy of Sciences USA 48:1390) in 0.9 M NaCI, 0.09 M Tris-HCI pH 7.6, 6 mM EDTA, 0.5% HP-40, IX Denhardt's solution, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium monobasic phosphate, 0.1 mM ATP, and 0.2 mg of yeast RNA per ml following standard Southem blotting procedures for 12 to 24 hours optimally.<br>

 <br>
In a preferred aspect, the mature polypeptide coding sequence is nucleotides 388 to 1332 of SEQ ID NO: 1, nucleotides 98 to 821 of SEQ ID NO: 3, nucleotides 126 to 978 of SEQ ID NO: 5, nucleotides 55 to 678 of SEQ ID NO: 7, nucleotides 58 to 912 of SEQ ID NO: 9, nucleotides 67 to 796 of SEQ ID NO: 11, or nucleotides 77 to 766 of SEQ ID NO: 13. See polynucleotide section herein.<br>
In a sixth aspect, isolated polypeptides having cellulolytic enhancing activity are artificial variants comprising a substitution, deletion, and/or insertion of ond or' triOre (or several) amino acids of the mature polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ lb NO:* 4, SEQ ID NO: 6. SEQ ID NO: 8, or SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 12, or SEQ ID NO: 14; or a homologous sequence thereof. Preferably, amino acid changes are of a minor nature, that is conservative amino acid substitutions or insertions that do not signiflcantiy affect the folding and/or activity of the protein; small deletions, typically of one to about 30 amino acids; small amino- or carboxyl-terminal extensions, such as an amino-termlnai methionine residue; a small linker peptide of up to about 20-25 residues; or a sniall extension that facilitates purification by changing net charge or another function,,such a^ a poly-histidine tract, an antigenic epitope or a binding domain.<br>
Examples of conservative substitutions are within the group of basic amino acids (arginine, lysine and histidine), acidic amino acids (glutamic acid and aspaitic acid), polar amino acids (glutamine and asparagine), hydrophobic amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine), and small amino acids (glycine, alanine, serine, threonine and methionine). Amino acid substitutions that do not generally alter specific activity are itnown in the art and are described, for example, by H. Neurath and R.L. Hill, 1979, In, The Proteins, Academic Press, New Yorlt. The most commonly occurring exchanges are Ala/Ser, Val/lle, Asp/Glu, Thr/Ser, Ala/Gly, Alan"hr, Ser/Asn, Ala/Val, Ser/Gly, Tyr/Phe, Ala/Pro, Lys/Arg, Asp/Asn, Leu/lle, LeuA/al, Ala/Glu, and Asp/Gly.<br>
In addition to the 20 standard amino acids, non-standard amino aci(^8 (such as 4-hydroxyproiine, 6-A/-methyl lysine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, isovaiine, and alpha-methyl serine) may be substituted for amino acid residues of a wild-type polypeptide. A limited number of non-conservative amino acids, amino acids that are not encoded by the genetic code, and unnatural amino acids may be substituted for amino acid residues. "Unnatural amino acids" have been modified after protein synthesis, and/or have a chemical structure in their side chain(s) different from that of the standard amino acids. Unnatural amino acids can be chemically synthesized, and preferably, are commercially<br>
available, and include pipecolic acid, thiazolidine carboxylic acid, dehydroproline, 3^ and<br>
' '	■ ■ f,',   '   J.'   "'<br>
4-methylproiine, and 3,3-dimethylproline.<br>
27<br>
 <br>
Alternatively, the amino acid changes are of such a nature that the physico-chemical properties of the polypeptides are altered. For example, amino acid changes may improve the thermal stability of the polypeptide, alter the substrate specificity, change the pH optimum, and the like.<br>
Essential amino acids in the parent polypeptide can be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scannlng mutagenesis (Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, single alanine mutations are introduced at every residue in the moleicule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for biolpglcal activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. See also, Hilton et ai, 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271: 4699-4708. The active site of the enzyme or other biological interaction can also be determined by physical analysis of structure, as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance, crystallography, electron diffraction, or photoaffinity labeling, in conjunction with mutation of putative contact site amino acids. See, for example, de Vos et al., 1992, Science 255: 306-312; Smith et a/., 1992, J. Mo/ Biol. 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et al., 1992, FEBS Lett. 309: 59-64. The identities pf essential amino acids can also be inferred from analysis of identities with polypeptides that are related to a polypeptide according to the invention.<br>
Single or multiple amino acid substitutions, deletions, and/or insertions can be made and tested using known methods of mutagenesis, recombination, and/or shuffling, followed by a relevant screening procedure, such as those disclosed by Reidhaar-Olson and Sauer, 1988, Science 241: 53-57; Bowie and Sauer, 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: 2152-2156; WO 95/17413; or WO 95/22626. Other methods that can be used include error-prone PCR, phage display (e.g., Lowman ef al., 1991, Biochem. 30: 10832-10837; U.S. Patent No. 5,223,409; WO 92/06204), and region-directed mutagenesis (Derbyshire et al., 1986, Gene 46:145; Ner et al., 1988, DNA 7:127).<br>
I\^utagenesis/shuffling methods can be combined with high-throughput, automated screening methods to detect activity of cloned, mutagenized polypeptides expressed by host cells (Ness et al., 1999, Nature Biotechnology 17: 893^896). Mutagenized DNA molecules that encode active polypeptides can be recovered from the host cells and rapidly sequenced using standard methods in the art. These methods allow the rapid determination of the importance of individual amino acid residues in a polypeptide of interest, and can be applied to polypeptides of unknown structure.<br>
