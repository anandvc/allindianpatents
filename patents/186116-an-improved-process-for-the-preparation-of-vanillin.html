				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of vanillin. Particularly this invention relates to the biotransformation of isoeugenol, eugenol- a clove principles, and ferulic acid and coniferyl aldehyde to vanillin using axenic cultures of Spirulina spp. In this process, vanillin is produced from the micro alga Spirulina cultures when fed with precursors-isoeugenol, eugenol, ferulic acid and coniferyl aldehyde.<br>
In the past decade, there has been an increasing and steady shift in consumer preference toward the use of food ingredients derived from natural sources in view of their safety over the synthetic ones (Dziezak, J.D. (1986) Food Technol. 40, 108; Tyrell, M.H. (1990) Food Technol., 44, 68; Stofberg, J.(1986) In: Biogeneration of aromas (ed.) Parliament T.H. and Croteau, R. ACS Symposium series No. 317, 2; Sahai, O.M. (1994) Plant tissue culture. In: Bioprocess production of flavors, fragrances, and color ingredients (ed.) Gabelman, A. 239-275). Among the natural flavors, vanillin, a prime industrial molecule, is used in food and flavor industry. It is a key component of frozen desserts, yogurt, baked goods, candies, liquers, sweets, pudding, cakes, and beverages (Roger and Diane (1994) Trends in Biol. Sci. 19, 521; H&amp;R Contact, No.59, 15-19; Webster, T.M. (1995) Cereal Foods World, 40, 198-200). The very high price of natural vanilla flavor isolated from vanilla pod, and the consumer demand for naturally produced foods have stimulated the<br>
search for alternative means of vanillin production     (Gatfield,  IL,(1995)<br>
Perfumery &amp; Flavourist, 20, 5-14).<br>
Natural  vanilla   is a complex  mixture of flavor components extracted<br>
from the cured beans Vanilla planifolia. The   extraction process involves an<br>
initial curing process, during which vanilla-precursor glycosides in the bean breakdown to form natural vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzaldehyde) and its related flavor components such as vanillic acid, vanillyl alcohol, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-hydroxybenzadehyde, etc., followed by one or more alcohol extractions to remove the relatively hydrophobic flavor components from the bean. Each of these steps may be relatively time-consuming and costly (Riely, K.A and Kleyn, D.H (1989) Food Technol. 43, 64- 67; Webster, T.M. (1995) Cereal Foods World 40, 198-200). The cost of natural vanilla is US $ 4, 000/Kg flavor solids and US $ 70- 90/Kg beans, whereas synthetic vanillin at US $ 15/Kg (Roger, C. and Diane, E.G.(1994), Trends Biol. Sci. 19, 521; Westcott, R.J. et al., (1994) Phytochem. 35,135-138).<br>
A very promising way to obtain natural flavors is the use of microorganism since, up to now, the European Economic Community (EEC) legislation incorporates under the term "natural products" those produced from biological sources, by living cells, or their components, including enzymes (Hardinge, J. (1990) Chemistry and Industry (London) Nov. 694- 698, Sahai.O.M (1994) In: Bioprocess production offlavor, fragrance, and color ingredients (ed.) Gabelman, A. 30-39).<br>
Current legislation in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) governing natural flavors or natural flavorings in the United States defines naturals in 21 CFR 101.22 (a) (3) as isolates from both plant and animal sources, fermentation products and commonly called "Process flavor products" which are flavors derived from thermal reaction and enzymatic treatment (Tyrell, M. (1995) Perfumery &amp; flavourist 40,13-19).<br>
The biotransformation of isoeugenol and eugenol to vanillin obtained in an edible alga Spirulina spp. is useful for the production of food grade vanillin. Vanillin has been obtained by biotransformation using microbial agents and also found in plant cell cultures. The following are the patents currently available pertaining to this.<br>
The production of vanillin described by Robenhorst and Hopp (1991) involves the incubation of Serratia spp., Enterobacter spp., and Klebsialla spp. cells with 2% eugenol or isoeugenol after 20 hrs of inoculation. The reaction was carried out till 300 hrs. The production of vanillin is more in isoeugenol than in eugenol incubated cultures (EP 405197 A1).<br>
In another    patent (US 5068184) Knuth and Sahai explains the production of vanillin from callus/suspension cultures of Vanilla  planifolia and optimization of media composition, analysis of flavor composition, and in situ recovery of vanilla flavor using suitable adsorbants has been described.<br>
The production of vanillin through the bioconversion of vanillin precursor, ferulic acid with a tissue culture of undifferentiated cells derived from Vanilla plant/ and enzymes obtained therefrom in the presence of a water soluble sulphydryl compound and optimally, also in the presence of assimilate carbon source has been described (Labuda I.M. et a/., US 5279950).<br>
The process described by Mane and Zucca (*1993) involves the production and effective release  of vanilla flavor from pods   using hydrolytic enzymes has also been patented (FR 2 691 880 A1).<br>
A process described by Westcott, R.J. et a/., involves producing natural vanillin from ferulic acid as a precursor has     been developed on the use of<br>
Vanilla plant aerial roots as the biocatalyst (Phytochemistry (1994) 35, 135-138).<br>
1.	The chemical process is not an ideal alternative to biological process due to the demand   for the<br>
latter for     natural flavor  production. The synthetic vanillin/vanilla flavor lacks all the   essential<br>
attributes of natural (Sahai, O.M. (1994) Plant tissue  culture In: Bioprocess production of flavor,<br>
fragrance and colour ingredients (ed.) GabelmanA., 239-275).<br>
2.	Conventional process involves specific agroclimatic requirements and curing and drying of pods<br>
is tedious (Knuth et al., (1991) Flavor composition and method, US patent No.5068184).<br>
3.	The   biotechnological process involves growth of plant cells   or microbial cells as biological<br>
agents  in vanillin      production and these culture systems are heterotrophic needing more costly<br>
nutrient inputs for their growth and scale up also is difficult.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of vanillin. Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of vanillin using an autotrophic organism -Spirulina species.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process    for the preparation of<br>
vanillin which comprises: cultvating Spirulina spp. in a conventional nutreint medium having been<br>
supplemented with a compound convertable to vanilliniStteh-as isoeugenol, eugenol, ferulic acid and<br>
coniferyl aldehyde for at least 18 hrs. in a known manner then recovering vanillin by conventional solvent extraction methods from the cells and medium.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention a compound convertable  to<br>
vanillin used may be such as eugenol, isoeugenol, ferulic acid   and conferyl aldehyde.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the solvent used to  extract vanillin used may be such as ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and hexane. The steps involved in the process is as follows:<br>
1. Developing   of axenic cultures of  Spirulina spp. by plating techniques on Zarrouk's medium (1966).<br>
Composition of the Zarrouk's medium:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
2.	Developing of suspension cultures of Spirulina spp. from axenic cultures in<br>
zarrouk's liquid medium.<br>
3.	Feeding of isoeugenol and eugenol to Spirulina suspension cultures.<br>
4.	The separation of Spirulina cells from liquid medium by filtration on whatman<br>
filter paper.<br>
5.	Extraction of vanillin using suitable organic solvent.<br>
6.	Concentration of organic solvent fraction containing vanillin under reduced<br>
pressure.<br>
7.	Preparation of ethanolic extract of vanillin.<br>
8.	Quantification of vanillin flavor.<br>
The  examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention. EXAMPLE 1: A 5 day old suspension cultures of Spirulina (40 ml) were fed with filter sterilized isoeugenol at 1.25 mM and   cultures were incubated on rotary shaker at 90 rpm under the light intensity of 2000 Lux at 25 Â±2Â°C. The cultures were analysed at 24 hrs interval and experiment has been carried out till 120 hours. The   cells were separated from the medium by filtration using whatman No.4.   The cells and   medium were   extracted for isoeugenol   and vanillin using ethyl acetate as    organic solvent. The solvent fraction was concentrated in vacuuo   and fraction was dissolved in 80% (v/v) ethanol, and used for analysis. The analysis and quantification of vanillin was done by TLC, Spectrophotometry, HPLC and FTIR. The Rf values recorded for   isoeugenol and vanillin was 0.59 and 0.17   respectively, and quantification was done using calibration curve at 280 nm for     vanillin and 260 nm for isoeugenol. HPLC analysis was carried out by eluting fractions of isoeugenol and    vanillin   from TLC plates, using methanol, acetic acid, and water as solvent. The   FTIR was carried out using concentrated fraction of ethyl acetate.  The FTIR spectrum showed  the strong peaks at 1700  cm'1 (-CHO), 3500 cm"1 (-OH), 1158 cm"1 (-C-O-C) and 1640 cm"1   (-C=C) due to characteristic groups of vanillin and<br>
isoeugenol   (Fig.4). The maximum production of vanillin was obtained on 48 hrswhich was 1243.57 jig/culture with 20-25% conversion or 31.093 mg/L of medium   (Fig.2).   The   biotransformation   of     isoeugenol   to   vanillin   was extracellular.<br>
EXAMPLE 2: A 5-6 day old suspension cultures of Spirulina (40 ml) were fed with filter sterilised   isoeugenol  at  2.5 mM   and   cultures were incubated on rotary shaker at 90 rpm under the light intensity of 2000 Lux at 25 Â± 2 Â°C. The cultures were   analysed at 12 hrs interval and experiment has been carried out till 72  hours.  The cells were separated from the medium  by filtration using whatman No.4. The cells and medium were     extracted for isoeugenol and vanillin using ethyl acetate as    organic solvent. The solvent fraction was concentrated in vacuuo and fraction was dissolved in 80% (v/v) ethanol,   and used   for    analysis. The analysis and quantification of vanillin was done by TLC, Spectrophotometry,    HPLC and FTIR. The Rf values recorded    for isoeugenol and vanillin was   0.59 and 0.17, respectively,    quantification was done using calibration curve at 280 nm for vanillin and 260 nm for isoeugenol. HPLC analysis was carried out  by eluting fractions of isoeugenol and vanillin from TLC plates,  using methanol, acetic acid, and water as solvent. The FTIR was   carried out using concentrated fraction of     ethyl acetate. The   FTIR spectrum   showed the strong peaks at 1700 cm"1 (-CHO), 3500   cm"1 (-OH), 1158 cm"1 (-C-O-C) and 1640 cm"1 (-C=C) due to   characteristic   groups of vanillin and isoeugenol. The maximum production of vanillin was obtained on 36 hrs which was 1274.95 ^g/culture with 10-12% conversion or 31.875 mg/L of medium.     (Fig.1). The     biotransformation of isoeugenol to vanillin was extracellular.<br>
shaker at 90 rpm under the light intensity of 2000 Lux at 25 Â± 2 Â°C. The cultures were analysed at 12 hrs interval and experiment has been carried out till 72 hours. The cells were separated from the medium by filtration using whatman No.4. The cells and medium were extracted for isoeugenol and vanillin using ethyl acetate as organic  solvent.

The maximum production of vanillin was obtained on 36 hrs which was   1778.92 jag/culture. The biotransformation of isoeugenol to   vanillin was extracellular.<br>
EXAMPLE 4: A 5-6 day old suspension cultures of Spirulina (40 ml) were fed with filter sterilised eugenol at 1.25 mM and cultures were incubated on rotary shaker at 90 rpm under the light intensity of 2000 Lux at 25 Â±2Â°C. The cultures were analysed at  12 hrs interval and experiment has been carried out till 72 hours. The cells were separated from the medium by filtration using whatman<br>
No.4. The cells and medium were extracted for  eugenol    and vanillin using ethyl acetate as organic solvent.   The solvent fraction was concentrated in vacuuo and fraction was dissolved in 80% (v/v) ethanol, and used for analysis. The   analysis       and    quantification    of   vanillin   was   done    by   TLC, Spectrophotometry, HPLC and FTIR. The Rf values recorded for eugenol and vanillin was    0.82 and 0.58 respectively,    quantification was done using calibration curve at 280 nm for vanillin and 260 nm for eugenol. HPLC analysis was carried out by eluting fractions of eugenol and vanillin from TLC plates, using methanol, acetic acid, and water as solvent. The  FTIR   was carried out using concentrated fraction of ethyl acetate.   The   FTIR spectrum showed the strong peaks at 1700 cm'1 (-CHO),   3500 cm"1 (-OH), 1158 cm'1 (-C-O-C) and 1640 cm"1 (-C=C) due to   characteristic groups of vanillin and eugenol. The maximum    production of vanillin was obtained on 36 hrs which was 153.58 ng/culture. The biotransformation of eugenol to vanillin was extracellular. The principle  involved   in the method is as follows: The  vanillin   is   produced from Spirulina  spp. cultures when  fed with isoeugenol and eugenol, a clove principles, (which are not naturally present in the Spirulina   system). Hence,   this     biotransformation is a novel method wherein foreign compounds, isoeugenol, and eugenol has been converted into value added product, vanillin.<br>
The formation of vanillin from isoeugenol involves two steps. (Fig.3). In the first step, formation of  ferulic   acid    from isoeugenol reaction wherein methyl group of aromatic side chain is converted to carboxylic acid group. In second step,  formation of vanillin from ferulic acid might be  via feruloy CoA<br>
through a reaction to similar to p - oxidation of fatty acids   (Funk and Brodelius<br>
1990).<br>
Eugenol can bioconverted to either coniferyl aldehyde or ferulic acid; both of which are useful intermediates in the bioconversion to vanillin. EXAMPLE 5: A 5-6 day old suspension cultures of Spirulina (40 ml) were fed with filter sterilized ferulic acid at 1.25 mM   concentration and cultures were incubated on rotary shaker at 90   rpm under the light intensity of 2000 Lux at 25Â±2Â°C.    The    cultures were analysed periodically at 1 day interval and experiment was carried out for 5 days. The cells were separated   from the medium   by filtration using Whatman No. 4. The medium   was extracted with ethyl acetate after its pH adjusted to 2-3 using concentrated HCI. The cells were homogenized in mortar and pestle with ethyl acetate. The solvent fraction was concentrated    under reduced pressure and the concentrated residue was dissolved in known volume of 80% (v/v) ethanol and is used for analysis. The analysis was carried out by TLC, HPLC and GC. The Rf values   recorded for vanillin (0.74), vanillic acid (0.69), ferulic acid   (0.66) respectively in Benzene, dioxane and acetic acid solvent system. HPLC was carried out using Shimadzu LC-6A liquid chromatograph with RP-C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d, Shim-pack) connected to C18 guard column using methanol, acetic acid and water as solvent system. The GC analysis was carried out using Shimadzu GC-15A SE-30 column with temperature programme   using N2 as carrier gas. The analysis of medium of ferulic acid fed Spirulina cultures showed the formation of vanilla flavor   components such as vanillin, vanillic acid, vanillyl alcohol and protocatechuic acid.  The cells did not show formation of these  compounds. The maximum production of vanillin, vanillic acid recorded on 5th day at 964.10,<br>
3,387.53 fig/culture, whereas  vanillyl alcohol and protocatechuic acid showed<br>
maximum on   1st   day at 90.29, 239.76 jig/culture respectively (Fig. 5). The biotransformation of ferulic acid to vanilla flavor components was found to be extracellular.<br>
EXAMPLE 6: A 5-6 day old suspension cultures of Spirulina (40 ml) were fed with filter sterilized coniferyl aldehyde at 1.0 mM   concentration and cultures were incubated on rotary shaker at 90 rpm under the light intensity of 1500 Lux at 25Â±2Â°C. The cultures   were analysed periodically at 1 day   interval and experiment has    been carried out 4 days. The samples were analysed periodically  by separating cells from the medium by filtration using Whatman No.4. The medium was extracted with ethyl acetate after its pH   adjusted to acidc side (2-3) with concentrated HCI. The solvent fraction was concentrated under reduced pressure and the concentrated residue was dissolved in known volume of 80% (v/v) ethanol and is used for analysis. The analysis was carried out   using HPLC and GC. HPLC analysis was carried out using Shimadzu LC-6A liquid chromatograph with RP-C18 column connected to C18   guard column using methanol, acetic acid and water as solvent   system.   The GC analysis was carried out with Shimadzu GC 15A   using SE-30 column with temperature programme using Na as carrier   gas. The analysis of medium showed conversion of coniferyl aldehyde to vanilla flavor components such as vanillin, vanillic   acid, protocatechuic acid and ferulic acid. The cells did not show the formation of either precursor or products. Hence, this   reaction was found to be extracellular. The maximum accumulation of vanillin was on 2 day at 685.89 ng/culture whereas vanillic acid, protocatechuic acid and ferulic acid recorded     maximum     on     4th     day     at     159.89,     129.56,     1508.25 ng/culture,respectively. The   formation of ferulic acid was more than other<br>
components because    ferulic acid is nearer to coniferyl aldehyde in the biosynthetic pathway (Fig.6).<br>
1.	The biological agent used for biotransformation is  Spirulina which is an<br>
edible alga.<br>
2.	The feeding of precursor is simple. The isoeugenol and       eugenol are<br>
easy to obtain from clove oil hence is also    from natural source. Similarly<br>
ferulic acid and coniferyl aldehyde can  be obtained from natural sources<br>
such as com hulls and bark of fir tress, respectively.<br>
3.	The reaction is extracellular hence downstream processing is easier.<br>
4.	The process is ecofreindly in large scale production since it   involves a<br>
photosynthetic organism as biocatalyst.<br>
The novelty of the process involves the use of autotrophic system especially of an approved food grade organism - Spirulina spp. for the production of vanillin by biotransformation. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
