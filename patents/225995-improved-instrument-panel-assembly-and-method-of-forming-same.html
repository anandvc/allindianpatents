method of Forming Same, filed March 31, 2003, which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference for all purposes.<br>
It is contemplated that the first and second structures and the first and second<br>
constructions may be formed of a variety of different materials.   Moreover, it is<br>
5     contemplated that various portions or components of the first and second structures<br>
and the first and  second  constructions may be formed of different materials.<br>
Exemplary materials include metals, polymeric materials or the like.<br>
Preferably the constructions are formed of a plastic molding.- The plastics material preferably comprises a homopolymer, for example a polyolefin, a 10 polyamide, a polyphenylene oxide and polystyrene, or a copolymer, for example a polyalkylene terephthalate.<br>
Preferred plastics materials include polypropylene, polyamide, polyamide alloys, polyethylene (low or high density), polyphenylene oxide polymers, polyphenylene oxide alloys, polystyrene polymers, polystyrene alloys, polybutylene 15 terephthalate polymers, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polycarbonate acrylonitrile butadiene styrene PC/ABS, competitor grade plastics (e.g., styrene maleic anhydride (SMA) 7, blends of the above polymers with polyphenylene ether or polyphenylene oxide or the like) and polybutylene terephthalate alloys. The plastics material may contain fibre, for example short glass fibre, long glass fibre, 20     short natural fibre or long natural fibre.<br>
Especially preferred plastics materials include short glass fibre filled polypropylene, long glass fibre filled polypropylene, short fiber glass filled ABS, long glass fiber filled ABS, short glass fiber filled PC/ABS, long glass fiber filled PC/ABS, glass filled polyamide and glass filled polyamide alloys.-Plastics materials which are 25 especially preferred for use in bumper systems as the EAU include unfilled polypropylene, talc filled polypropylene, mineral filled polypropylene]<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, the polymeric materials may include fibers for additional strength. Although it is contemplated that fibers of various sizes (e.g., lengths) may be employed, advantageously, it has been found that relatively long 30 glass fibers add a relatively high degree of strength. Thus, in preferred embodiments, a polymeric material such as ABS, PCABS, polypropylene or another suitable plastic is filled with glass fibers having an average length of approximately greater than 2 mm, more preferably greater than about 4mm even more preferably greater than about 6 mm and most preferably between about 8 mm and 20 mm.<br>

The polymers or plastics may also include a variety of fillers. Exemplary fillers include, without limitation, silica, diatomaceous earth, glass, clay, talc, pigments, colorants, carbon ceramic fibers, mica, antioxidants, and the like.<br>
It is possible to make constructions using art-disclosed techniques for the 5 fabrication of the material selected. Thus, for example, the constructions may be formed, molded, machined or otherwise configured to the desired shape. Where the constructions are plastic, it is possible to use any suitable plastic fabrication technique including, without limitation, injection molding (including but not limited to external or internal gas injection molding), blow molding, compression molding,<br>
10 rotational molding, thermoforming, extruding, vacuum forming, foaming-in-place, or otherwise. One or more other fabrication techniques can also be employed such as insert molding, over-molding or a combination thereof. Accordingly, as can be appreciated, in one embodiment, hybrid panel assemblies can be fabricated, thereby taking advantage of the  benefits of different respective materials and different<br>
15 respective fabrication techniques, and also advantageously permitting for the ability to design additional features.<br>
The framework structures are preferably are at least partially or substantially entirely formed of one or more metals such as aluminum, iron, tungsten, magnesium, steel, tin, copper, titanium, combinations thereof or the like.   Formation<br>
20 of the structures may also be accomplished using a variety of techniques. For example, the structures may be roll formed, cast, stamped or the like. The structures may also be molded, extruded, or the like.<br>
The instrument panel assembly 10 is formed, generally, by attaching the one or more framework structures to the one  or more  constructions.     It is also<br>
25 contemplated that, for plural framework structures or for plural constructions, the framework structures may be attached to each other and the constructions may be attached to each other.<br>
Any suitable fastening techniques may be employed for attaching the constructions   together,   the   framework   structures   together,   or   attaching   the<br>
30 framework structures to the constructions. For example, mechanical fasteners such as screws, clips, rivets, interlocking devices combinations thereof or the like may be employed. Moreover, such attachments may be integrally formed with or separate from the framework structures or constructions. Alternatively or additionally, the structures may be integrated with the constructions by molding at least a portion of<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2004/074026	PCT/US2G04/003857<br>
the constructions about the structures according to one of the molding techniques described herein. As other alternatives or. other additions, heat staking, vibrational welding, sonic welding, combinations thereof or the like may be used.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated and with additional reference to Figs. 2A and 5 2B, the first framework structure 12 is adhered to the first construction 18 and the second framework structure 14 is adhered to both the first and second constructions 18, 20. Preferably, an adhesive 76 is applied to mating or corresponding surfaces 78, 80, 82, 84, 86 of the first framework structures 12, the second framework structure 14, the first construction 18, the second construction 20 or a combination<br>
10 thereof. Thereafter, the mating or corresponding surfaces 78, 80, 82F 84, 86 are pressed toward each other to adhere the surfaces 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, and thus, the framework structures 12, 14 and constructions 18, 20 together.<br>
Any suitable adhesive may be employed in the present invention.  Preferably, the adhesive is compatible with (i.e., capable of adhering to) the material of the<br>
15 surfaces of the structures and constructions. If, however, the adhesive is slightly incompatible with one of these materials, it may be desirable to treat the surface[s] formed of the incompatible material. Exemplary treatments include the application of primer, exposure to plasma, combinations thereof or the like.<br>
In one embodiment, the adhesive is a urethane based adhesive, and more<br>
20 preferably a urethane adhesive (e.g., a polyurethane adhesive). Alternatively, the adhesive may include a functional component selected from, an acrylic, methyl methacrylate (MMA), an epoxy, an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a polycarbonate (PC), or a mixture thereof (e.g. PC-ABS). In a further alternative embodiment the adhesive is a siiane adhesive, a silicone adhesive or a mixture<br>
25 thereof. In yet another embodiment, the adhesive is an acrylic adhesive. The adhesive may also be epoxy based. It may include polyolefinics, styrenics, acrylics or mixtures thereof. In yet another embodiment, a preferred adhesive includes alkyl borane. Examples of suitable adhesives are disclosed in commonly owned U.S. Patent No. 09/466,321 (filed December 17, 1999) and patent publication numbers<br>
30 20020058764 and 20030001410 expressly incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. Any such adhesive may include suitable performance modifiers including art disclosed tacktfiers, elastomers, impact modifiers, or the like.<br>
