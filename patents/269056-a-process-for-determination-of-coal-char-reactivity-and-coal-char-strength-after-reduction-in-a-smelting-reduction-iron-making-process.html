Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to processes for smelting reduction iron making processes and in particular to a process for determination of Coal Char Reactivity Index (CCRI) and Coal Char Strength After Reduction (CCSR) which favour deciding on the suitability of coal for such processes including the Corex process, smelting reduction iron making process and Finex process. Importantly, the above process of the invention would provide simulating and giving an understanding of the condition such as reactivity of coal char near tuyeres, strength and permeability of coal char. Thus, the invention would favours the development of much desired test procedure which can simulate the coal char reactivity and its strength after reaction near tuyeres of Corex and Finex processes where melter-gasifier function is involved.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is known in the art that Corex is a smelting reduction iron making process developed as an alternative to Blast Furnace (BF) .Such Corex process usually consist of two reactors (i) the reduction shaft and (ii) the melter gasifier. It is also well known that in Corex process, non coking coal is used for heat generation, production of reducing gases and to maintain adequate bed permeability unlike in Blast Furnace (BF) where coke meets such requirements.<br>
Thus, the non coking coals which can be used in Corex have to meet physical, chemical and high temperature properties for stable process and to attain high performance levels. Importantly, it is also observed during years of Corex operation that high temperature properties of coal play a major role for stable performance.<br>
It is also known that the development of the Corex process also provided procedures to test the high temperature properties of coal such as thermal decrepitation and thermo mechanical stability. The thermal decrepitation test measures the grain preservation index (+ 10 mm), and dust generation index (- 2mm) of coal during rapid heating condition in the melter - gasifier, which simulates the dome conditions.<br>
The thermo mechanical stability determines the strength of char found after devolatilization of coal in the char bed of melter - gasifier. Both the above tests however only simulate the condition and behaviour of coal in the melter gasifier dome and in the fixed char bed. The<br>
2<br><br>
behavior of coal char formed after devolatilization in dome and fixed bed in front of the tuyeres could not be determined with the above tests.<br>
Importantly, similar to coke ,CSR and CRI, the coal char reactivity and strength after reaction, are a major concern, as these play a major role in the formation of stable char beds. However, in the absence of any such method to determine char reactivity and its strength after reaction, no effective process of determining such coal char reactivity and strength after reaction was possible which in turn affected the possibility of understanding the reaction process in Corex.<br>
Moreover, the absence of any manner of determination of coal char reactivity and strength after reaction which are a major concern in the formation of stable char bed, there had been a continuing problem to effectively decide on the suitability of the coal for such processes including the Corex, Finex processes which involve melter - gasifier functions. Moreover, the absence of such tests procedure also make it extremely difficult to understand related conditions of such process such as the reactivity of coal char near tuyeres, strength and permeability to the coal char. Also, such limitations in carrying out the Corex or Finex processes involving such melter -gasifier functions also, lead to concerns which affect optimizing the coal blend and the stabilization of the processes especially such as the Corex or Finex process.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a process for simple yet effective determination of coal char reactivity index and coal char strength after reaction which would favour effective and proper utilization of processes such as the Corex or Finex process involving melter gasifier functions.<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for better efficacy and utilization of Corex process where non-coking coal is used for heat generation, production of reducing gases and to maintain adequate bed permeability by providing for meeting physical, chemical and high temperature properties for stable process and to attain high performance levels.<br>
Another objects of the present invention is directed to facilitate smelting reduction iron making processes such as Corex, Finex were the high temperature properties of coal is known to play a major role for stable performance.<br>
3<br><br>
Yet another objects of the present invention is directed to avoid the limitations of presently available methods of simulation of the conditions and behavior of coal in the melter-gasifier dome and in the fixed char bed and provide for processes for determination of behavior of coal char (formed after devolatalization in dome and fixed bed) in front of the tuyeres and thereby favour the iron making processes such as Corex and Finex.<br>
A further objects of the present invention is directed to a process for simulating coal char reactivity and its strength after reaction near tuyeres of Corex melter-gasifier.<br>
Another objects of the present invention is provided to favour iron making processes by making available decisions on suitability of Corex process.<br>
A further objects of the present invention is directed to achieve optimization of coal blend and stabilization and improvement in efficiency of Corex process and Finex process where melter - gasifier functions are involved.<br>

The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustration of the process for determination of coal char reactivity index and coal char strength after reaction in accordance with the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES : Example 1:<br>
Under this example, the preparation of the coal char for testing the coal char reactivity index and coal char strength after reaction in accordance with the present invention was carried out as follows:-<br>
The gross sample was collected from yard and screened to 20-25 mm and 500 g of representative sample was taken for the test;<br>
the representative sample was next soaked at a temperature of 1000° C for a period 1h in an inert atmosphere (N2) to remove the VM;<br>
the representative sample was next cooled in an inert atmosphere to a temperature of about 80°C;<br>
the representative sample was next screened at 19-21 mm; and<br>
Coal decrepitation apparatus was used for the preparation of coal char as above.<br>
8<br><br>
Example 2:<br>
Under this example, the test procedure for determining the coal char reactivity index and coal char strength after reaction in accordance with the invention was carried out as detailed hereunder:-<br>
200 g of 19-21 mm size char sample having 
after reaching 1100°C, the N2 flow was suspended and sample reacted with C02 at flow rate of about 300 Iph for 120 min.;<br>
after 120 min., the C02 flow was suspended and the sample cooled in N2 atmosphere at a flow rate of about 300 Iph till the sample reached to a temperature 
the sample was next weighed and the weight recorded. The sample was tumbled in a tumbler drum of size about 130mm dia, 700mm length for 600 rev at 20 rpm;<br>
the tumbled sample was screened at 10mm and wt. pf +10mm &amp; -10mm was recorded;<br>
the Coal Char Reactivity Index (CCRI) and Coal Char Strength after Reaction (CCSR) was calculated as follows:<br>
CCRI _   (Initial wt of the sample - wt of the sample after reaction with CO2)    X 100<br>
( Initial wt of the sample)<br>
CCSR _		(Wt. of +10mm sample)	   x 100<br>
(wt of the sample after  reaction with C02)<br>
In accordance with an embodiment, the dimensions of the CO gas generator retort which is used for CCRI &amp; CCSR determination include dimensions such as Length: 750 - 900 mm;Intemal Diameter: 90 - 124 mm and Plate thickness: 5-10 mm.<br>
Following the above process of the invention, the CCRI % and CCRS % of variety of coals were determined as indicated in the following Table I:<br>
TABLE I<br>
Coal	A	B	C<br>
CCSR, %	60	47	35<br>
CCRI, %	24	34	40<br>
                                                                                             9<br><br>
Based on the above identified CCRI % and CCRS % of the above variety of coals Coal A, Coal B and Coal C ,it was possible to formulate different coal blends and further studies were carried out to ascertain the Corex performance and its dependency based on the coal blend CCRS%. For such purpose the following coal blends involving the above Coal grades A,B and C were obtained as per the Examples D,E and F as further detailed under Table II hereunder:<br>
TABLE II<br>
Coal Blend<br>
Coal Blend	D	E	F<br>
Coal A, %	15	10	10<br>
   Coal B, %	45	40	30<br>
Coal C, %	40	50	60<br>
Blend CCSR, %	45	43	41.5<br>
The Corex performance of the above Coal Blends were noted and the results are noted hereunder in Table III:<br>
TABLE III<br><br>
Corex Performance Parameters<br>
Coal Blend	D	E	F<br>
Production        rate, t/hr	105	103	102<br>
Fuel rate, kg/thm	943	1037	1053<br>
It would be clearly apparent from the above that selective use of coal blends with high CCSR resulted in superior performance of Corex.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to determine the suitability of coal for Corex process. Advantageously, the process of the invention would simulate and provide for the much required understanding of the conditions, such as reactivity of coal char near tuyeres, strength, and permeability of coal char.<br>
As illustrated by way of the present invention, the CCSR and CCRI values of various coals obtained from the tests detailed above would favour optimizing the coal blend and stabilize the Corex process. Importantly, the invention demonstrates that the use of blend with high CCSR resulted in much desired superior performance of Corex. As also discussed hereinbefore the above process of the invention is applicable also to Finex process, where the melter-gasifier function is same as in Corex.<br>
10<br><br>
Advantageously, the invention would avoid the limitations of presently available method of simulation of the conditions and behavior of coal in the melter-gasifier dome and in the fixed char bed and provide for processes for determination of behavior of coal char (formed after devolatalization in dome and fixed bed) in front of the tuyeres and thereby favour the iron making processes such as Corex and Finex.<br>
Thus the present invention would provide the required process for simple yet effective determination of coal char reactivity index and coal char strength after reaction which would favour effective and proper utilization of processes such as the Corex or Finex process involving melter gasifier functions. Importantly also the invention would favour better efficacy and utilization of Corex process where non-coking coal is used for heat generation, production of reducing gases and to maintain adequate bed permeability by providing for meeting physical, chemical and high temperature properties for stable process and to attain high performance levels.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
A PROCESS FOR DETERMINATION OF COAL CHAR REACTIVITY AND COAL CHAR STRENGTH AFTER REDUCTION IN A SMELTING REDUCTION IRON MAKING PROCESS.<br>
A process for determination of Coal Char Reactivity Index (CCRI) arid Coal Char Strength After Reduction (CCSR) directed to favour deciding on the suitability of coal for processes especially the Corex process, smelting reduction iron making process and Finex process. Importantly, the above process would favour simulating and giving an understanding of the condition such as reactivity of coal char near tuyeres, strength and permeability of coal char. Thus, the invention is directed to the development of much desired test procedure which can simulate the coal char reactivity and its strength after reaction near tuyeres of Corex and Finex processes for effective and proper utilization of such processes where melter-gasifier function is involved.<br>
