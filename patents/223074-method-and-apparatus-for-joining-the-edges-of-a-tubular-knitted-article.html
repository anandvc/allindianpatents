				<td>TITLE<br>
"Method and apparatus for joining the edges of a tubular<br>
knitted article"<br>
SPECIFICATION<br>
The present invention refers to a method and apparatus for<br>
joining the edges of a tubular knitted article, such as a<br>
stocking, upon the completion of the latter on a circular<br>
machine.<br>
Methods and machines are known for closing tubular articles.<br>
In particular, the European Patents EP-0.592.376 and EP-<br>
0.635.593 disclose how to close tubular articles,<br>
specifically with a hooked-up finish, by carrying out the<br>
above said operation on the outer or right-side out of the<br>
article. The document Ep-0.942.086 discloses how to hook-up<br>
the fabric edges on the desired side by applying an operating<br>
method which takes into account the type of article's<br>
manufacturing machine. In particular, provision is made for<br>
possibly hooking-up on the inner or inside-out side of the<br>
article by removing in advance the same article from a one-<br>
cylinder machine.<br>
The above mentioned solutions, although representing<br>
undoubtedly an advance with respect to the existing systems,<br>
suffer from some drawbacks. One drawback relates to the<br>
excessive handling of the stitches, that is, an excessive<br>
number of transfers thereof to and from various members which<br>
brings about a higher possibility of losses and/or damages of<br>
the same stitches. Another drawback is the fact that the<br>
means and machines so constructed may result relatively<br>
complex and thus apt to be industrialized only by industries<br>
exhibiting advanced technology and a high level of know-how.<br>
The above drawbacks, which relate to one-cylinder machines,<br>
hold true also in the case of removing the articles from the<br>
lower cylinder of a two-cylinder machine, that is, in case<br>
the stitches are removed with their right side out.<br>
The object of the present invention is to overcome the said<br>
drawbacks.<br>
This result has been achieved, according to the invention, by<br>
providing a method and apparatus having the features<br>
disclosed in the independent claims. Further characteristics<br>
being set forth in the dependent claims.<br>
Among the advantages of the present invention, one is that it<br>
provides the solution for the major problem concerning the<br>
case in which the article is removed from the cylinder of a<br>
one-cylinder machine or the lower cylinder of a two-cylinder<br>
machine, with its right-side out and by a limited number of<br>
stitch transfers; in fact, one important characteristic of<br>
the operating method according to the present invention is<br>
that the transfer of the stitches from the first semi-rank<br>
takes place by a 180°-overturning of the same means which<br>
have carried out the removal thereof and, thus, without any<br>
transfer of the stitches onto further means, thereby limiting<br>
the handling thereof. Moreover, the apparatus implementing<br>
the method according to the invention results extremely<br>
simple to make and reliable even after a prolonged service<br>
life.<br>
These and other advantages and characteristics of the<br>
invention will be best understood by anyone skilled in the<br>
art from a reading of the following description in<br>
conjunction with the attached drawings given as a practical<br>
exemplification of the invention, but not to be considered in<br>
a limitative sense, wherein:<br>
- Fig. 1 is a front view, with parts in section, of a head<br>
for knitting an article (a stocking, in particular), which<br>
shows the head upon completion of the knitting of the<br>
stocking in correspondence of the toe which remains open;<br>
- Fig. 2 shows the machine of the preceding figure, upon the<br>
subsequent operating phase in which the plate is lifted to<br>
make the knitting head of the machine accessible, and in<br>
which the needles are lifted so as to move each stitch up to<br>
the so-called "unloading" position, that is, below the<br>
respective latch of the needle;<br>
- Fig. 3 refers to the phase in which, according to the<br>
invention, a movable carrier provided with removal means is<br>
moved onto the knitting head of the machine and the needles<br>
are further lifted so as to take the stitches to be removed<br>
above the sinkers;<br>
- Fig. 4 refers to a phase in which some of the above removal<br>
means - to be referred to later on also as punches - are<br>
moved close to the relevant heads of the needles;<br>
- Fig. 5 refers to a phase in which stitch-pushing means,<br>
which can be used during the removal phase and are<br>
hereinafter referred to also as hooks - are moved below the<br>
stitches to be removed and disposed in a closing<br>
configuration;<br>
- Fig. 6 refers to a phase for lifting the hooks and, along<br>
with them, the stitches which disengage from the needles and<br>
pass onto the removal means;<br>
- Fig. 7 shows the lifting of the punches which move away<br>
from the needles, and the consequent lifting of the article<br>
now released from the knitting head of the machine;<br>
- Fig. 8 shows the phase in which the carrier is moved away,<br>
along with the article supported thereon, from the knitting<br>
head of the machine;<br>
- Fig. 9 shows a subsequent phase in which the article is<br>
moved to a hooking-up station and inserted within a inside-<br>
out-turning tube presented by the same station;<br>
- Fig. 10 shows the phase in which the inside-out-turning<br>
tube is lifted, thereby allowing the article to turned<br>
inside-out achieving the turning inside-out of the article<br>
with the initial end thereof oriented upwards above the rank<br>
of stitches removed from the punches;<br>
- Fig. 11 shows the final stage of the lifting operation, in<br>
which the turning-inside-out tube remains engaged with<br>
relevant supporting means (not shown) in correspondence of<br>
its upper end, while the lower end of the tube remains free<br>
and above the plane of the removed stitches, with the article<br>
resulting fitted on the outer side of said tube;<br>
- Fig. 12 shows the phase in which the stitches of a first<br>
semi-rank are overturned through substantially 180° about the<br>
diametral axis which ideally divides the circumference of the<br>
removed rank into two semi-ranks;<br>
- Fig. 13 shows the phase in which, after the overturning<br>
shown in the preceding figure, each member for the removal of<br>
the first semi-rank is in correspondence of a member for the<br>
removal of the second semi-rank, with the respective free<br>
ends thereof being close to each other;<br>
- Fig. 14 shows the phase in which the first rank-removing<br>
members are brought back to their starting position by<br>
operating the above said overturning in the opposite<br>
direction;<br>

With reference to the figures of the attached drawings, an<br>
apparatus according to the invention comprises a movable<br>
carrier 300 which is moved close to and away from a knitting<br>
head 100, and can be rotated and vertically displaced as<br>
well. Figs. 85 and 86 show schematically the movement of<br>
carrier 300. In the example, the movable carrier 300 is<br>
supported by a relevant arm 10 horizontally disposed. The arm<br>
10 is keyed on the sleeve 302 which is fitted on a relevant<br>
hollow column 301. Provided inside the column 301 is a<br>
pneumatic lifting cylinder 303, whose rod 308 is fixed inside<br>
the sleeve 302 in correspondence of the proximal end 307 of<br>
the arm 10. In this way, an extension of rod 308 corresponds<br>
to a lift of the arm 10 and of the movable carrier 300 as<br>
well supported by the latter. The lower portion 309 of the<br>
sleeve 302 is provided with a toothing 305. Also provided is<br>
a pneumatic cylinder 306, horizontally disposed, whose rod<br>
310 supports a rack 304 complementary to the toothing 305 and<br>
meshing therewith. The travel of rod 310 drives into rotation<br>
the sleeve 302 about its longitudinal axis a-a and,<br>
consequently, causes the supported movable carrier 300 to<br>
rotate as well. Moreover, the toothing 305 moves to a height<br>
Q corresponding to the vertical travel of the sleeve onto the<br>
column 301 (or longer than the latter); this allows rotating<br>
the arm 10 while displacing it up to different levels. Again<br>
with reference to the accompanying drawings, and in<br>
particular to Figs. 1-18, the knitting head 100 is provided,<br>
in a known manner, with a cylinder 1, needles 2, sinkers 3,<br>
and a sinkers case 4. The completion of an article 6, such as<br>
a stocking, is made on the knitting head 100 with the use of<br>
a plate group 5. Upon completion of the knitting, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1, the stocking or article 6 has the<br>
configuration in which the tubular part is knitted and the<br>
toe remains open.<br>
At this point, the plate 5 is lifted (see Fig. 2) in a known<br>
manner which, therefore, will not be described herein in<br>
detail. At the same time, the needles 2 of the knitting head<br>
100 are lifted so as to move each stitch of article 6 to the<br>
position so-called "unloaded" in technical jargon, that is,<br>
to a level along the needle which is below the latch 201 of<br>
the needle 2 (numeral 200 indicating the needle's head).<br>
As mentioned before, and as shown in Fig. 3, the apparatus in<br>
question comprises the movable carrier 300 supported by the<br>
arm 10 which allows the vertical and rotational movement<br>
thereof. After the plate 5 is moved away, the movable carrier<br>
300, provided with means for the removal of the article, is<br>
superimposed to the knitting head 100. In this phase, the<br>
needles 2 are further lifted so as to move the stitches above<br>
the sinkers 3.<br>
Before describing the operation of the apparatus any further,<br>
let us point out the characteristics of the movable carrier<br>
300 by making reference in particular to Figs. 19-35. The<br>
movable carrier 300 exhibits a support body 11 on. which<br>
relevant hooks 14 are fixed and intended to move the stitches<br>
during the removal of the needles 2 from the knitting head<br>
100. The supporting body 11 has a hollow cylindrical shape<br>
with two cross-sections: one upper cross-section of greater<br>
diameter 110 and one lower cross-section of smaller diameter<br>
111. The hooks 14 are inserted into a corresponding number of<br>
slots 130 vertically disposed and presented by a hook-<br>
supporting crown 13 located externally and coaxially to the<br>
body 11 which supports the movable carrier 300.<br>
Moreover, the support body 11 exhibits, in correspondence of<br>
the region connecting the upper 110 with the lower 111<br>
section, a projecting peripheral edge or frame 112. Coming to<br>
rest on the frame 112 is a hollow cylindrical element 12<br>
which defines a cam. The cam element 12 results interposed<br>
between the body 11 and the crown 13 supporting the hooks 14.<br>
As best shown in Fig. 19, the hooks 14 have, when viewed<br>
laterally, a substantially "L" shape, with the short leg 145<br>
of the "L" being disposed below. The upper end 140 of the<br>
hooks 14 is inserted into an annular cavity 131, of<br>
rectangular cross-section, formed on the outside of crown 13.<br>
In correspondence of the said upper end 140, the hooks 14<br>
exhibit a groove 141 on their outer side (that is, on the<br>
side facing centrifugally relative to the movable carrier<br>
300). On the inner side (that is, centripetally with respect<br>
to carrier 300), the end 140 has a triangular portion<br>
defining a step 142 connected with the apex 144 of the upper<br>
end 140 via an oblique portion 143, that is, a portion with<br>
oblique edge to the longitudinal development of the stem of<br>
hook 14.<br>
Housed within the grooves 141 of hooks 14 is an elastic ring<br>
(designated by numeral 8 in Fig. 13 only, for the sake of<br>
clarity) which retains the said ends 140 inside the cavity<br>
131 of crown 13. In this way, in the absence of further<br>
interventions, the oblique portions 143 of the hooks result<br>
in contact with and parallel to the vertical wall of cavity<br>
131, as they are kept so retained by the elastic reaction<br>
force of the above mentioned ring. This determines an<br>
outwardly inclination of the stems of hooks 14, which, owing<br>
to the action of the elastic ring, result in an open<br>
configuration such as that shown also in Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
Besides, the presence of the step or tooth 142 determines a<br>
restraint to the downward displacement of the hooks 14 within<br>
the slots 130 where they are inserted.<br>
Provided externally to the crown 13 is a ring 15 (hereinafter<br>
also referred to as "hook-closing ring") intended for moving<br>
the hooks 14. The ring 15 is "fitted on the crown 13 and is<br>
able to slide vertically relative to the same crown. Provided<br>
on the hook-closing ring 15 are one or more helicoidal slots<br>
150. The helicoidal slots 150 act like cams able to determine<br>
the vertical movement of the hook-closing ring 15 in<br>
correspondence of the rotational movement of relevant pivots<br>
inserted into the slots 150.<br>
Moreover, oblique slots 120 are formed on the cam element 12<br>
to receive corresponding pivots 132 (in Fig. 28, numeral 132<br>
designates the axis of one of the pivots 132) which connect<br>
the cam element 12 with the crown 13 so as to allow the<br>
vertical movement of the latter upon the displacement of<br>
pivots 132 within the cams defined by the oblique slots 120.<br>
In Fig. 28, besides, numeral 134 designates a hole, and<br>
numeral 135 designates the axis of the pivot inserted therein<br>
and able to connect the support body 11 with the crown 15.<br>
Provided on the lower portion of the support body 11 are two<br>
groups of removal members 26, 25 (also called punches in the<br>
present description) to be associated, respectively, with the<br>
first and second semi-rank of the article knitted on the<br>
knitting machine 100. In some of the attached figures, only<br>
one punch or removal member 25 or 26 is shown, for the sake<br>
of clarity, when a plurality of these members is provided in<br>
repeating series, such as in Figs. 23, 25, 28, 29 and others.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 3-18, fixed in the left side of the<br>
lower portion of the support body 11 is a crown 20 supporting<br>
the removal members 25 of the second semi-rank. As best<br>
viewable in Fig. 34, the crown 20 has a half thereof provided<br>
with seats for the punches 25. The removal members 26 of the<br>
first semi-rank are disposed on a semicrown 21 supported by a<br>
semicircular sector 22 hinged to the lower portion 11 of body<br>
11 in correspondence of two diametrically opposite hinges 23.<br>
As will be described later on in greater detail, the<br>
semicircular sector 22 can be rotated through 180° so as to<br>
dispose the semicrown 21 of the first semi-rank below the<br>
crown 20 of the second semi-rank. Moreover, with reference in<br>
particular to Fig. 30, provision is made for cylindrical<br>
containers 88 on the semicircular sector 22 to receive<br>
stitch-pushing springs to be described below, while holes 89<br>
are provided for the passage of vertical bars 16 described<br>
with reference to Figs. 75-80, and holes 87 for the passage<br>
of screws (not shown) for fixing the crown 20 to the body 11.<br>
In the illustrated exemplary embodiment (as best illustrated<br>
in Figs. 61-67), the removal members 26 of the first semi-<br>
rank are essentially made up of a rectilinear and flat body<br>
which is tapered in its distal end 251. In correspondence of<br>
said end 251, on the side in which the taper begins, a notch<br>
252 is formed within the thickness of the said body to<br>
receive the needle 2 of the knitting head 100 during the<br>
removal phase (as illustrated in Figs. 68-70). On the<br>
opposite or proximal side, the removal member 26 exhibits a<br>
stem 250 by which it is retained firmly by the support means<br>
defined by the semicrown 21. The removal members 25 of the<br>
second semi-rank (see Figs. 55-60) are like those of the<br>
first semi-rank above described, as far as the free end 251<br>
and the cavity 252 allowing the engagement thereof with the<br>
needle of the knitting machine are concerned, but they differ<br>
in the stem's region. (In Fig. 69, numerals 25 and 26 refer<br>
generically to a removal member which is similar for both<br>
first and second semi-rank; Fig. 70 also shows a generic stem<br>
250 as this part is similar for the first and second semi-<br>
rank) . The above characteristic differentiation of the stem's<br>
region is due to the difference of the support means (that<br>
is, crown 20) which allow an oscillatory movement with radial<br>
direction, that is, with "in-out" direction with respect to<br>
the circumference of the needles. This results of advantage<br>
in allowing a good covering during the engagement for the<br>
transfer of the stitches of the first semi-rank onto the<br>
removal members of the second semi-rank since, by a<br>
centripetal movement of the free ends of the removal members<br>
of the second semi-rank, it is safer to have the apexes of<br>
the ends of the latter inserted into respective cavities of<br>
the removal members of the first semi-rank (see Figs. 71-74).<br>
In this context, the term "covering" refers to the partial<br>
overlapping of two elements (for example, two removal<br>
members, or one removal member and one needle) to allow the<br>
passage of a stitch from one to another of said elements<br>
without having any dead regions or times in which the stitch<br>
is not engaged by one of the two elements. In Fig. 74 at 66,<br>
two stitches of the article 6 are schematically represented<br>
as they are made to pass from the removal member 26 to the<br>
removal member 25, thanks to the above said covering<br>
situation.<br>
The above described movement is centripetally induced by a<br>
spring (or other elastic body) which is opposed by a semi-<br>
ring or semi-crown 24 acting on the inside of stems 250 of<br>
the same removal members 25 where a special profile<br>
(indicated with 254) acts as a cam upon the variation of<br>
longitudinal position of said semi-ring 24. In practice, when<br>
the semi-ring 24 interacts with the profile 254 (stein's minor<br>
section) the removal member is maintained in the inner<br>
position; when, instead, the semi-ring 24 interacts with the<br>
removal member's portion closest to apex 251 (major section),<br>
the removal member 26 is pushed outwardly. With reference to<br>
the examples of the attached drawings, Figs. 7 5-80 show how<br>
the removal member 25 is inclined either inwardly or<br>
outwardly according to the operating phase. In particular,<br>
Fig. 75 shows (partially) the movable carrier in removal<br>
position in which the removal member 25 is kept facing<br>
outwardly (direction indicated by the arrow V); on the<br>
contrary, in Fig. 7 6 the removal member is in a stitch-<br>
transfer position and is kept facing inwardly by the action<br>
of spring 19 (an elastic ring in the illustrated example)<br>
being not opposed by the semi-ring 24 which, in fact, lies in<br>
the profile 254 of the removal member; again in this figure<br>
an arrow (W) indicates the direction of displacement of the<br>
removal member 25.<br>
In Figs. 75-83 are shown some details that do not appear in<br>
the preceding figures, for example, pneumatic cylinders 29<br>
provided on the arm 10. The pneumatic cylinders 29 operate<br>
via relevant rods 90 on a support element 17 exhibiting<br>
vertical bars 16 facing downwards. The support element 17 is<br>
vertically slidable inside the support body 11, and springs<br>
18 are disposed between the latter and the support element 17<br>
to provide a reaction able to push the element 17 upwards,<br>
that is, in a direction opposite to that of the downward<br>
thrust of rods 90. In some of the drawings, the springs 18<br>
are represented only partially. With reference to Figs. 75-80<br>
in particular, the activation of the cylinder 29 causes the<br>
lowering of the rod 90, with the consequent downward<br>
displacement of the support element 17. This determines the<br>
lowering of the bar 16 which (as indicated by the arrows Z in<br>
Fig. 75) pushes down the semi-crown 24, so that the latter,<br>
being no longer in correspondence of the cam profile 254,<br>
pushes the removal member 25 outwardly (arrow V) . On the<br>
contrary, when the bar 16 is brought back upwards (arrow T in<br>
Fig. 76) , the semi-crown 24 too moves up to engage the<br>
profile 254, and the action of the spring 19 wins that of the<br>
removal member 25 which is thus kept inwardly (arrow W).<br>
Figs. 81-84 show an alternative embodiment of the said<br>
removal members 25. In this embodiment, each removal member<br>
25 is fixed on the relevant crown 20, and the covering<br>
condition is obtained by disposing the removal members 26 of<br>
the first semi-rank and those of the second semi-rank over<br>
two ideal circumferences of different radius and/or providing<br>
a group (for example, the punches 26) of larger size with<br>
respect to the other group of punches. These characteristics<br>
are more evident by the detail of Fig. 84 where the punch 26<br>
of the first semi-rank results further externally (as it lies<br>
on a circumference of larger radius) than the punch 25 of the<br>
second semi-rank and, besides, it has a size larger than the<br>
other.<br>
As above mentioned, once the group of plate 5 has been moved<br>
away, the movable carrier 300 is placed above the knitting<br>
machine 100.<br>
At this point (see Fig. 4), the removal members 25 and 26 are<br>
moved closer to the respective needle heads, and the<br>
interaction between the needles 2 and removal members 25, 26<br>
is similar to that illustrated in Figs. 68-70. Afterwards<br>
(Fig. 5), the hook-closing ring 15 is lowered, thereby<br>
determining the positioning of the hooks 14 below the<br>
stitches to be removed which are, therefore, in their closed<br>
configuration. As can be seen in Fig. 6, the support crown 13<br>
is lifted, along with the hooks 14 supported by the same<br>
crown, so that the hooks move the article's stitches upwards<br>
and the latter disengage from the needles 2 to pass onto the<br>
removal members 25 and 26. Thereafter (Figs. 7, 8, 9), the<br>
movable carrier 300 is further lifted and moved away form the<br>
knitting head 100 to take the article on to a hook-up station<br>
provided with an inside-out turning tube 30 in which the<br>
article 6 is inserted. The moving of article 6 away from the<br>
knitting head 100 can be effected soon after removing the<br>
stitches from the needles of the knitting head, as above<br>
described, or it can be effected afterwards, for example, in<br>
a possible alternative embodiment of the method, after the<br>
phase - to be described later on - in which the stitches of<br>
the two semi-ranks are moved close to each other.<br>
Figs. 36-53 illustrate embodiments, to be described later on<br>
in details, of the inside-out-turning tube 30. The general<br>
structure of said tube can be imagined, for example, like a<br>
tubular body inside which the article is inserted when the<br>
stitches of the last semi-rank, that is, the removed<br>
stitches, are still disposed around a circumference, that is,<br>
prior to the overturning through 180° of the first semi-rank.<br>
Thereafter, by a longitudinal movement, the article engaged<br>
on the tube is forced to pass through the open end of the<br>
tube, thereby causing the inside-out turning of the article,<br>
with the stocking that will be fitted outside the tubular<br>
body.<br>
The inside-out-turning tube 30 is then lifted (Figs. 9-11)<br>
thus causing the inside-out turning of the article which<br>
results fitted on the outside of the tube 30, with the<br>
initial end of the same article facing upwards and above the<br>
rank of stitches removed by the removal members. In the final<br>
phase (illustrated in Fig. 11), the inside-out turning tube<br>
30 is engaged with relevant support means (not shown) in<br>
correspondence of its upper end, whereas the lower end of the<br>
tube remains free and above the plane of the removed<br>
stitches.<br>
The inside-out turning phases above described, and those to<br>
be described below for preparing the hook-up operation, can<br>
be carried out at any point of the path of the movable<br>
carrier, that is, at positions different from the one<br>
described herein by way of example.<br>
Afterwards, the hook-closing ring 15 is moved upwards thereby<br>
determining the opening of the hooks 14, that is, their<br>
displacement in centripetal direction.<br>
At this point (see Figs. 12-14), the stitches of the<br>
article's first semi-rank supported by removal members 26 are<br>
transferred by an overturning thereof of substantially 180°<br>
about the diametral axis which ideally divides the<br>
circumference of the removed rank into two semi-ranks. Thus,<br>
each removal member 26 of the first semi-rank lies in<br>
correspondence of a removal member 25 of the second semi-<br>
rank, with the respective free ends close to each other in a<br>
configuration similar to that described with reference to<br>
Figs. 71-74; in this configuration, each stitch of the first<br>
semi-rank results juxtaposed and coaxial to the corresponding<br>
stitch of the second semi-rank.<br>
At this point, through the action of a pusher 31 acting from<br>
the bottom upwards, a stitch-pushing semi-crown 28 makes the<br>
stitches slide along the removal members 26 to take them up<br>
onto the removal members 25 of the second semi-ranks located<br>
above.<br>
Subsequently, the removal members 26 of the first semi-rank<br>
are brought back to their original position by the above said<br>
overturning operated in opposite direction.<br>
Depicted in the lower side of Fig. 14 is a portion of the<br>
hook-up machine 400, comprising a support body 42, a crown 41<br>
with relevant hook-up spines 40, all being well known<br>
elements which, therefore, need not to be described in<br>
detail.<br>
With reference to Figs. 15-18, the hook-up spines 40 are<br>
moved close to the removal members 25 which, as already<br>
mentioned, support the two overlapping semi-ranks of the<br>
article; afterwards, owing to the downwardly directed push of<br>
a stitch-pushing semi-crown 27 coaxial to the circumference<br>
formed by the removal members 25, the stitches are<br>
transferred onto the spines 40.<br>
The semi-crowns 27 and 28 are shaped alike a semicircular<br>
comb, with a series of slots 270 and 280 angularly spaced<br>
apart by such extents which correspond to the angular<br>
displacement between the removal members 26 and 25, so that<br>
the same semi-crowns are able to slide along the removal<br>
members while guided vertically by the latter.<br>
Shown in Fig. 17 is a hook-up needle 43, by means of which<br>
the hook-up of stitches and/or pairs of stitches being fitted<br>
on spines is performed in a known manner by carrying, out the<br>
necessary chain-closing knots.<br>
According to the alternative embodiment illustrated in Figs.<br>
87-88, the pairs of stitches of the two semi-ranks, can be<br>
supported - during the closing/hooking-up of the toe of<br>
stocking 6 - by the punches 25 of the second semi-rank, and a<br>
hook-up needle 43 can be brought close to the latter, which<br>
needle, instead of operating the hook-up on spines provided<br>
for this purpose, will perform such operation by exploiting<br>
the punches 25 which, advantageously, exhibit the said cavity<br>
252, that is, the one used for the engagement of the needle<br>
2.<br>
Finally (Fig. 18), once the stitches have been hooked-up onto<br>
the spines (or, likewise to the example of Figs. 87-88, onto<br>
the punches 25 of the second semi-rank located on the movable<br>
carrier) , the article 6 is pushed inside the same inside-out<br>
turning tube 30 so as to take up a right-side-out condition.<br>
This operation can be carried out by using a bar 32 to be<br>
inserted into the tube 30 by an extent sufficient to complete<br>
the right-side-out arrangement of the article which, after<br>
such operation, is definitely ejected.<br>
As above mentioned, Figs. 36-53 show exemplary embodiments of<br>
the inside-out-turning tube 30.<br>
One way to perform the introduction of the article into the<br>
inside-out-turning tube 30 may consist in aspirating the<br>
article inside a single tubular element. With reference to<br>
the examples illustrated by the drawings, the body of tube 30<br>
may consist of two coaxial elements 35, 36 whose front or<br>
upper ends 350, 360, that is, those facing the article before<br>
the inside-out-turning thereof, are so shaped as to define<br>
alternately a closed or open ring by a rotation of said two<br>
elements relative to each other and about the common<br>
longitudinal axis. A so-formed device allows inserting the<br>
article thereinside by a transverse movement when the mouth<br>
portion is in open condition (semi-ring configuration) and<br>
definitely "trapping" the same article by a closing of its<br>
perimeter.<br>
The outer tubular element 35 has below a cylindrical closed<br>
shape; from its mid portion upwards, it exhibits a semi-<br>
cylindrical shape, that is, a wall 353. developing through<br>
about 180° on one side only with respect to the longitudinal<br>
axis, thereby defining a corresponding lateral opening or<br>
port 352 having longitudinal development; in the upper end,<br>
the element 35 exhibits a semi-ring 351 defined by a<br>
cylindrical surface of a relatively limited height and<br>
extending approximately through 180° on the side opposite to<br>
the wall 353.<br>
The inner tubular element 36 has in its lower part, likewise<br>
the element 35, a closed cylindrical shape; from its mid<br>
portion up to the upper end 360, it exhibits a semi-<br>
cylindrical shape, that is, a wall 363 developing through<br>
approximately 180° on one side only with respect to the<br>
longitudinal axis, thereby defining a corresponding lateral<br>
opening or port 362 having longitudinal development; the<br>
upper end 360 is thus defined by the upper edge 361 of the<br>
wall 363.<br>
When the tube 30 is in its open configuration, the semi-ring<br>
351 of the outer element 35 encircles the edge 361 of the<br>
inner element; in this way, it is possible to introduce the<br>
article 6 inside the tube by a simple translation movement<br>
without the need of moving the tube vertically downwards by a<br>
stroke which would be substantially equal to the length of<br>
the knitted article. This brings about a significant<br>
reduction of the apparatus overall dimensions. Thereafter, by<br>
a simple relative rotation of the two elements 35 and 36 the<br>
tube 30 is closed, thereby allowing the inside-out-turning<br>
operation.<br>
The structure of the said tube can be imagined, for example,<br>
like a tubular body inside which the article is inserted when<br>
the stitches of the last semi-rank, that is, the removed<br>
stitches, are still disposed around a circumference, that is,<br>
prior to the overturning through 180°. of the first semi-rank.<br>
Thereafter, by a longitudinal movement, the article engaged<br>
on the tube is forced to pass through the open end of the<br>
tube and is thus turned inside-out. It will be appreciated<br>
that, at this point, the stocking is fitted outside the<br>
tubular body. The said tubular body, after the said movement,<br>
remains engaged with a support located on the side opposite<br>
to the article. After the hook-up operation, the now closed<br>
toe of the article will result in proximity of the tube's<br>
mouth, so that, by inserting a core of suitable size into the<br>
tube's mouth, the same core will be in contact with the<br>
article's fabric and, by keeping to move downwards will drive<br>
the same article along with it and the latter, by sliding<br>
over the edge of the tube will move thereinside by taking up<br>
the right-side out configuration which it had originally.<br>
Such operation can be carried out and/or assisted by a<br>
pneumatic or suction flow. After the ejection of the article,<br>
the above described tubular body can be brought back to its<br>
initial position to perform its function in the subsequent<br>
cycle.<br>
Practically, the construction details may vary in any<br>
equivalent way as far as the shape, dimensions, elements<br>
disposition, nature of the used materials are concerned,<br>
without nevertheless departing from the scope of the adopted<br>
solution idea and, thereby, remaining within the limits of<br>
the protection granted to the present patent.<br>
