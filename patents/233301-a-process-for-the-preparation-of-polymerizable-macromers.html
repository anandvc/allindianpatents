				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the preparation of polymerizable macromers containing N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) of molecular weight ranging between 700 Daltons to 1,00,000 Daltons having formula herein below<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein,<br>

fructofuranose, deoxyribose, galactosamine, sucrose, lactose, isomaltose, maltose,<br>
cellobiose, cellulose and amylose.<br>
More particularly it relates to the said polymerizable macromers  containing<br>
carbohydrate ligands and preparation thereof through the specific linkage mentioned<br>
herein. Still more particularly it relates to macromer, which bind more strongly to<br>
lysozyme than NAG itself.<br><br>
The macromers of the present invention as mentioned above are prepared by coupling acryloyl-spacer conjugate of formula (2) claimed in our copending Patent Application no 02994delnp2006 entitled'Oligomer and preparation thereof herein below<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

mannose exemplified with NAG as herein given below having Formula (3)<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein, n = 2 to 50<br><br>
The polymerizable macromers may be used for inhibition of viral infections and the<br>
recoveries of biomolecules. The approach of synthesis of polymerizable macromers with<br>
ligand N-Acetyl Glucosamine (NAG) is a generic and can be used for other ligands such<br>
as sialic acid, galactose and mannose.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART REFERENCES:<br>
Carbohydrates play a crucial role in biological phenomena and therefore these molecules<br>
have attracted the attention of chemists and biochemists. These biomolecules are<br>
ubiquitous, figuring prominently in various processes such as cell differentiation, cell<br>
growth, inflammation, viral and bacterial infection, tumorigenesis and metastasis (Rouhi<br>
A.,M, C &amp; EN, Sept 23,62-66,1996).<br>
Many infections caused by bacteria and virus are a result of host receptor interactions. The<br>
foremost step for the infection is the adhesion of the ligands present on the infectious<br>
microbe to the receptors of the host cells. Adhesion and interactions have to be strong for a<br>
successful infection. If the adhesion is not adequate then normal defense mechanism can<br>
intercept this process. Viruses and bacteria for example interact with certain saccharides of<br>
the host cell. Bacteria express a large number of lectins and are used to adhere to<br>
glycocalyx of the host cell through a multivalent interactions. Agglutination of<br>
erythrocytes is a case in point.<br>
Carbohydrates exhibit molecular diversity and wide structural variations, which makes<br>
carbohydrates alternative ligands for competitive binding to inhibit the infections.<br>
Many alterations and modifications of the naturally occurring O-/ N-glycosidic sugars are<br>
being reported and is an area of prime interest to the chemist and biochemist.<br>
The importance of carbohydrates in biologically relevant recognition processes has been<br>
recognized fairly recently (Feizi, T., Biochem. J. 245:1,1987). In addition, carbohydrates<br>
on cell surfaces play an important role in intercellular communication and recognition<br>
processes, which is principally based on receptor-ligand interactions.<br>
Carbohydrates are usually attached to other moieties such as lipids or proteins.<br>
Belvilacqua et al., (Science, 243:1160,1989) have demonstrated the role of carbohydrates<br>
along with proteins and nucleic acids as a primary biological information carriers.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have observed that it may be worthwhile to use<br>
carbohydrates in therapeutics for human, especially since they can play an important role<br>
in prevention of viral and bacterial infections. Recently few reports have been published to<br>
justify the use of carbohydrates. Krepinsky et al. (United States Patent 6,184,368, 2001)<br>
suggested the application of carbohydrates in preventing the infections. Mandeville, et al.<br>
(United States Patent, 5,891,862,1999) reported the use of polyvalent polymers containing<br>
carbohydrates for the treatment of rotavirus infection<br>
Polyvalent molecules bind to the receptor molecules through multiple contacts, which<br>
results in strong binding. However the synthesis of ligands is critical and involves multiple<br>
steps. The polyvalent interactions can be maximized by incorporation of ligands optimally<br>
tailored based on the understanding of the binding between the ligand and the host<br>
receptor. The enhanced interactions are important especially when the ligands are<br>
expensive e.g. sialic acid.<br>
The inventors of the present invention have also observed that interactions of ligand with a<br>
receptor can be enhanced by 1) appropriate incorporation of the ligand 2) incorporation of<br>
spacer chain and 3) by steric stabilization/exclusion.<br>
Spaltenstein et al., (J.Am.Chem.Soc.,113:686,1991) reported increased interaction<br>
between the receptor and ligand due to plurality of binding ligands and the receptors on<br>
the host surface. This was illustrated by the influenza virus hemagglutinin, which binds to<br>
neuraminic acid on the cell surface, which has a greater affinity for its receptor when a<br>
polyvalent structure is presented.<br>
The early phase of infection by viral, parasitic, mycoplasmal and bacterial pathogens, is<br>
achieved by specific adhesion to cell surface carbohydrate epitopes (Dimick,et al.<br>
(J.Am.Chem.Society, 121,10286-10296,1999). Dwek, et al. (Chem. Rev., 96,693, 1996)<br>
reported the initiation of a wide range of human disease is mediated by proteincarbohydrate<br>
recognition step.<br>
If relative density and spatial arrangement of ligands incorporated is optimized, then the<br>
binding can be substantially enhanced. The enhanced interaction between molecular<br>
conjugate with a specific binding site of biomolecule also finds applications in affinity<br>
separations, drug delivery and biotechnology.<br>
To imitate and exploit this mechanism there is a need to devise a simple synthetic<br>
methodology, which will enhance substrate ligand interactions.<br>
Design of high affinity protein carbohydrate binding systems can provide an alternative<br>
strategy for the treatment of infectious diseases e.g. influenza and rotavirus. This has the<br>
advantage as such agents will not have pathogen resistance to antibiotics and drugs. A new<br>
approach to treat influenza is based on the principle of inhibition of virus to the host cells.<br>
The inhibitors like sialic acid anchored to polymeric or liposomal carriers have been<br>
reported in the past.<br>
Since monovalent interactions of natural oligosaccharides are weak, they need to be used<br>
in large quantities for an effective treatment. This problem can be overcome by<br>
synthesizing polyvalent carbohydrate molecules (Zopf, D., Roth, S. Lancet 347, 1017,<br>
1996). The concept is attractive since it would provide a non-toxic therapeutic to a wide<br>
range of human diseases. But synthesis of such compounds is critical and requires<br>
knowledge of the host-cell binding mechanism.<br>
Polymeric ligands that bind to the virus more powerfully than the Red Blood Cells will<br>
prevent the influenza infection. Similar binding is also involved in rotavirus infections.<br>
(Mandeville et al. United States Patent 6,187,762, 2001)<br>
Advantage of carbohydrate modification lies in that it may impart change in physical<br>
characteristics such as solubility, stability, activity, antibody recognition and susceptibility<br>
to enzyme. Sharon, et al., (Science,246:227-234,1989) reported carbohydrate portions of<br>
glyco-conjugate molecules to be important entity in carbohydrate biology.<br>
Haemagglutination can be prevented by saccharides multivalent glycoconjugates, which<br>
bind to the bacterial lectins and thus inhibit bacterial adhesion, (Sigal, et<br>
al.,J.Am.Chem.Soc.l 18:16,3789-3800,1996).<br>
Damschroder, et al. (United States Patent 2,548,520,1951) reported high molecular weight<br>
preformed polymers conjugated with unsaturated monomers or proteins. Synthesis of high<br>
molecular weight materials of this kind generally requires temperatures up to 100 ° C.<br>
Such high temperatures are not well tolerated by most of the proteins as they are<br>
thermolabile. Thus the methods described are unsuitable for producing polymers of<br>
biologically active molecules.<br>
Carbohydrates can be used as functionalized ligands by incorporation into polymer or<br>
macromer backbone. The macromer containing polyvalent ligand can be<br>
homopolymerized or copolymerized with suitable monomer to form a multivalent<br>
conjugate. Multivalent ligand may include shorter oligomers having pendant functional<br>
groups that may impart desirable properties to the polymer.<br>
The present invention involves coupling of oligomers comprising NAG and bearing<br>
terminal functional groups adequately described and covered in our copending patent<br>
application no. NF 363/02 entitled "Oligomer and preparation thereof " with<br>
polymerizable monomers containing vinyl unsaturation optionally containing a spacer to<br>
yield a macromers. We have demonstrated that macromers bind to lysozyme more<br>
strongly as evidenced by values of Kb and inhibit lysozyme more efficiently as evidenced<br>
by values of 150-<br>
Multivalent macromers of varied length and density will be useful for receptor ligand<br>
interactions of biological origin. Various chemical and chemoenzymatic methods have<br>
been reported in the past for the preparation of di and trivalent ligands, dendrimers, and<br>
high molecular weight polymers but have proven to be complicated to synthesize.<br>
Thus, there is necessity of a simple methodology to obtain multivalent ligands and<br>
polymers of varying chain length.<br>
Mammen, M., and Whitesides,G.,M., demonstrated that (J.Med.Chem.38:21,4179-<br>
90,1995) agglutination of erythrocytes caused by influenza virus could be prevented by<br>
use of polyvalent sialic acid inhibitor. Moreover, they suggested two favorable<br>
mechanisms for inhibition between the surfaces of virus and erythrocytes 1) high-affinity<br>
binding through polyvalency, and 2) steric stabilization. This novel approach is a model<br>
for pathogen-host interactions.<br>
Sigal, et al. (J.Am.Chem.Soc.l 18:16,3789-3800,1996) prepared polymers containing<br>
sialoside and evaluated the efficiency of inhibition of influenza virus in terms of inhibition<br>
constants (Kj).Although the authors observed that the extent of inhibition and minimum<br>
inhibition concentration decreased with increase in polymer molecular weight and sialic<br>
acid content, it was also noted that not all sialic acid ligands were involved in binding with<br>
the virus. This clearly indicates need of tailoring the polymer structure so that higher<br>
fraction of ligands is involved in binding.<br>
Spevak et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 115,1146-1147, 1993) reported the polymerized<br>
liposomes containing C-glycosides of sialic acid, which were potent inhibitors of influenza<br>
virus. Moreover the authors demonstrated that the infection was inhibited more effectively<br>
when the ligand bearing monomer was polymerized.<br>
Various methods have been reported in the past to synthesize multivalent ligands such as<br>
Ring-Opening Metathesis Polymerization (ROMP). ROMP has been used to generate<br>
defined, biologically active polymers by Gibson et al., (Chem. Comm., 1095-1096,1997)<br>
and Biagini et al., (Polymer, 39,1007-1014 ,1998).<br>
Carbohydrate receptors also have a role in intracellular trafficking of macromolecules.<br>
Therefore, macromolecules containing suitable ligands find applications in biomedical<br>
field for e.g. in targeting of drugs to certain tissues and cells in the organisms.<br>
Recent advancements in the field of glycoscience have demonstrated enhanced binding<br>
between carbohydrate ligands and specific receptors as a result of the cluster effect. These<br>
interactions are result from intrinsic properties of such ligands.<br>
Various methods have been reported in the past for the synthesis of glycoconjugate<br>
oligomers and the clusters for the receptor binding activity. Nishimora, et al.<br>
(Macromolecules, 27, 4876-4880,1994) synthesized sugar homopolymer clusters from<br>
acrylamidoalkyl glycosides of N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine. On addition of the polymer<br>
clusters, binding to WGA was enhanced.<br>
The polyvalent interactions have several advantages over monovalent interactions as a<br>
result of mode of receptor binding. Moreover, multivalent interactions lead to<br>
conformational contact with biological receptors, which subsequently results in enhanced<br>
interaction with the substrate.<br>
Previous methods of synthesis of polyvalent ligands are complicated and need higher<br>
inhibition concentrations. It is reported that the polymeric fucosides are resistant to<br>
neuraminidase enzyme present on the surface of influenza virus. The viruses also cleave<br>
sialic acid groups from molecules that bind to the surface of the virus, and thereby destroy<br>
the binding ability.<br>
The polymerizable macromers reported by the inventors of the present invention are<br>
effective at very low concentration which is a significant advantage when the ligands<br>
under consideration are expensive e.g. sialic acid. Further, these macromers can be<br>
copolymerized with other comonomers to provide copolymers containing polyvalent<br>
ligands. Moreover, the process reported here for the incorporation of polyvalent ligands<br>
into polymerizable macromers is relatively simple and involves lesser steps.<br>
The polymerizable macromers are of suitable molecular weights, which can efficiently<br>
bind to the target site.<br>
The ligands on the polymerizable macromers have ability to bind to various substrate<br>
molecules simultaneously. It is expected that the presence of multiple ligands in the<br>
backbone can enhance binding to the viruses and biomolecules. Thus the polymerizable<br>
macromer containing multiple ligands at low concentration are utilized and can potentially<br>
interact with multiple receptors thereby enhancing the inhibition.<br>
OBJECTIVE OF INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention therefore is to prepare polymerizable macromers<br>
comprising polyvalent NAG, which exhibit multivalent interactions and simple and novel<br>
process for the preparation thereof. The merits of the approach have been highlighted<br>
using NAG as an illustration.<br>
Another object is to provide polymerizable macromers which are more effective in<br>
binding with the lysozyme as evidenced by the values of the binding constants Kb and<br>
relative inhibition of lysozyme more effectively as evaluated by the values of I so<br>
Yet another object is to provide polymerizable macromers for applications in medicine<br>
and biotechnology.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a convenient process of preparation of polyvalent ligand<br>
NAG, mannose, galactose or sialic acid, fructose, ribulose, erythrolose, xylulose, psicose,<br>
sorbose, tagatose, glucopyranose, fructofuranose, deoxyribose, galactosamine, sucrose,<br>
lactose, isomaltose, maltose, cellobiose, cellulose and amylose.<br>
Another object is to provide a convenient process of preparation of polymerizable<br>
macromers, in the form of monomers containing Acryloyl, Methacryloyl or Para Vinyl<br>
Benzoyl (PVB) moieties.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a convenient process of incorporation of spacer arm to a<br>
polymerizable monomer.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a convenient process of conjugation of polymerizable<br>
monomer containing a spacer arm and polyvalent ligand.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a process of preparation of polymerizable macromers<br>
containing NAG ligands for enhanced interactions.<br>
Still another object is to provide more stable ligands for the interactions with biomolecules<br>
than the natural polymers such as chitin and chitosan containing natural ligand NAG.<br>
Therefore, the objective of the present work is to provide polymerizable macromers<br>
containing polyvalent ligand for enhanced interactions with the substrates and the process<br>
for the preparation thereof.<br>
Chitosan is a linear, binary heteropolysaccharide and consists of 2-aceta amido-2-deoxy -<br>
p-D-glucose (GlcNAc; A-unit) and 2-amino 2-deoxy-p-D-glucose (GlcNAc, D-unit). The<br>
active site of lysozyme comprises sub-sites designated A-F. Specific binding of chitosan<br>
sequences to lysozyme begins with binding of the NAG units in the subsite C. Moreover,<br>
there is a need to synthesize ligands similar to repeat units of chitosan which will not be<br>
hydrolyzed by lysozyme. Moreover natural ligands derived from glucose are susceptible to<br>
microbial growth. The polymerizable macromers reported here are stable than chitin and<br>
chitosan reported earlier.<br>
In our copending application no NF 363/02 entitled "Oligomer and preparation thereof<br>
we have shown that the oligomers of NAG in which the NAG groups are juxtaposed to<br>
one another, bind more effectively to lysozyme as reflected in values of binding constant<br>
(Kb) and the inhibition concentrations I5o<br>
The present invention provides polymerizable macromers containing NAG for a<br>
biomolecular target and method for preparation thereof.<br>
The macromers reported here can be homopolymerized or copolymerized with suitable<br>
monomers. The approach described to prepare polyvalent carbohydrate macromer<br>
containing NAG ligands is simple and can be used to synthesize other macromeric ligands<br>
such as sialic acid which bind to influenza virus and rotavirus. Such macromeric ligands<br>
may be even used as antiinfective agents both for prevention and treatment of diseases.<br>
Moreover, macromers containing NAG can be anchored to thermoprecipitating polymers<br>
that can be used for the recovery of biomolecules such as lysozyme and lectins.<br>
The polymerizable polyvalent macromers provided by the present invention can be<br>
used for application in recoveries of biomolecules.<br>
The macromers comprising monomer conjugated with polyvalent ligands may also<br>
further be used in the treatment of bacterial or viral infections, and are expected not<br>
to cause drug resistance.<br>
The approach described herein is a generic one and can be extended to other<br>
systems as well for example sialic acid.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The process for the preparation of the polymerizable macromers of the present invention is<br>
described herein below with reference to examples which are illustrative only and should<br>
not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
Example 1<br>
This example describes the process for the preparation of Methacryloyl 6-Amino Caproic<br>
Acid (M.Ac.6-ACA)<br>
250 ml capacity beaker was equipped with dropping funnel and pH meter. 13.16 gm<br>
6ACA, 4 gm. sodium hydroxide and 80 ml. water was stirred continuously at 5 ° C. on a<br>
magnetic stirrer. Nine milliliter of Methacryloyl Chloride in 10 ml dichloromethane was<br>
added drop wise to the above solution. The pH of reaction mixture was maintained at 7.5<br>
by the addition of 10 M NaOH solution. Unreacted acid chloride was extracted in 100 ml<br>
ethyl acetate. The clear aqueous solution was acidified to pH 5.0 using concentrated HC1<br>
and the product was extracted in ethyl acetate (3 x 100 ml). The organic layer was dried on<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated under vacuum. The viscous liquid was added<br>
to 500 ml petroleum ether. The solid product was obtained and vacuum dried for 48 hrs.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example describes the process for the preparation of Macromers: Acryloyl 6-Amino<br>
Caproyl poly. Acryloyl W-Acetyl Glucosamine ( Ac. 6 ACA.P.Ac.NAG )<br>
Ac.6 Amino Caproic Acid (0.122 gm.,0.00066 M) and P. Ac. W-Acetyl Glucosamine (2<br>
gm,0.00066 M)were taken in a 100 ml flask, DMF(25 ml) was added and stirred<br>
continuously to obtain a clear mixture. Di Cyclohexyl Carbodiimide (0.136 gm, 0.00066<br>
M) was first dissolved in DMF (5 ml) and added to the mixture dropwise. It was stirred<br>
continuously for 24 hrs. at room temperature. DCU was filtered off and the macromer was<br>
precipitated in acetone, and vacuum dried.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example describes estimation of binding constant (Kb) of monomers, oligomers, and<br>
macromers containing NAG incorporated as monomer and macromer by fluorescence<br>
spectrophotometric method and the enhancement resulting from conjugation with<br>
monomers and monomer containing spacer. The Binding constant Kb is a measure of<br>
affinity between the ligand containing NAG and lysozyme and does not include the steric<br>
contribution.<br>
Fluorescence spectra of lysozyme were recorded on a Perkin Elmer LS-50 B luminescence<br>
spectrophotometer. Excitation frequency was 285 nm. Solutions of lysozyme and NAcetyl<br>
Glucosamine were prepared in 0.066 M phosphate buffer pH 6.2, containing<br>
0.0154 M sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. 0.1 milliliter of lysozyme 80 ^g /ml<br>
was mixed with solution containing different ligand concentration in a 2 ml capacity 10<br>
mm square quartz cells maintained at 18 ° C. Phosphate buffer was added to make the<br>
volume to 2 ml. The fluorescence intensities of the solutions were measured, relative to<br>
the solutions containing enzymes and buffer mixtures of the identical concentrations<br>
reference. The relative fluorescence intensity of lysozyme saturated with solution<br>
containing different ligand concentration, Foe, was extrapolated from the experimental<br>
values by plotting I/ (F0-F) against 1/[S] where F is the measured fluorescence of a<br>
solution containing enzyme with given substrate concentration [S] and F0 is the<br>
fluorescence of the solution of enzyme alone (Chipman et al., J. Biol. Chem., 242-19,<br>
4388-4394,1967). The highest concentration of polymer substrates was used when enzyme<br>
was saturated more than 85 %.<br>
Table 1 : Binding Constants (Kb) for Monomers, Oligomers and Macromers Containing<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The binding constant for oligomers and macromers are summarized in Table 1 . wherein<br>
oligomer of molecular weight has binding constant 5.3 x 10 5, which shows 988 folds<br>
enhancement to NAG (5.24 xlO 2).<br>
On incorporation of spacer and polyvalent oligomer the binding constant for macromers is<br>
increased to 5.62 x 105 ,almost 930 times compared to JV-Acetyl Glucosamine.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example describes the estimation of inhibition of lysozyme by monomers, oligomers<br>
and macromer. I50 denotes the concentration of the ligand containing NAG at which 50 %<br>
of the highest achievable inhibition is achieved. Imax denotes the ligand concentration at<br>
which the maximum inhibition is achieved.<br>
Micrococcus lysodeikticus is a substrate for the enzyme lysozyme. Relative binding of<br>
macromers was estimated by using a procedure reported by Neuberger and Wilson (1967).<br>
1.5 % w/v stock solutions of macromer was prepared in 0.0066 M phosphate buffer pH 6.2<br>
containing 0.0154 m sodium chloride and 0.008 M sodium azide. One milliliter of stock<br>
solution containing different ligand concentration was mixed with 1.6 ml of 78 u£/ml of<br>
Micrococcus lysodeikticus in a 3-ml capacity glass cuvette. The mixture was incubated for<br>
5 minutes at 20 ° C. To this mixture 0.1 ml of lysozyme (27 |ig/ml) was added and mixed<br>
thoroughly. The relative absorbance at 450 nm (A 450) was recorded for 30 seconds. A<br>
blank reading without the ligand was noted and the change in the absorbance per second<br>
was calculated. Then relative inhibition was calculated.<br>
Table 2 : Estimation of Relative Inhibition of Lysozyme by Monomers, Oligomers and<br>
Macromers Containing NAG<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The relative inhibition of lysozyme in terms of I so. has decreased to 0.0026 for oligomer<br>
of molecular weight 638 and is almost 28000 folds lower to NAG. The inhibition for<br>
macromer is 0.00268 mM, which shows more than 27,000 folds decrease to NAG (74<br>
mM).<br>
The I max increased from 55.29 to 94.1 (Table 2).<br>
The advantages of the present invention are as follows :<br>
1. The polymerizable macromers reported here comprise polyvalent ligands and exhibit<br>
enhanced interactions.<br>
2. In addition such ligands have higher molecular weight and demonstrate greater<br>
efficiency through steric exclusion.<br>
3. The polymerizable macromers have greater water solubility, stability, and<br>
susceptibility to enzyme from hydrolysis.<br>
4. The enhancement in binding due to polyvalent interactions arise from the<br>
conformational flexibility of the polyvalent oligomers with the biological receptors.<br>
5. The method of preparation of polymerizable macromers containing polyvalent ligands<br>
is simple.<br>
6. The polymerizable macromers containing polyvalent NAG are effective even at low<br>
ligand concentration than monomer itself.<br>
7. The polymerizable macromers contain functional reactive groups and can be<br>
copolymerized with other comonomers.<br>
8. The polymerizable macromers can bind simultaneously to multiple binding sites of<br>
biomolecules thereby exhibiting enhanced interactions.<br><br><br><br><br>
