[Document  Name]   Specification<br>
[Title   of   the   Invention]    SCOOTER   TYPE   VEHICLE<br>
[Technical   Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a scooter type vehicle such as a motorcycle and more particularly to the location of a fuel injection valve of a fuel injection system.<br>
[Background Art] [0002]<br>
It is known that a scooter type vehicle has a head pipe supporting a steering wheel, a main frame extending obliquely downward and backward from the head pipe, a body frame including left and right rear frame extending obliquely upward and backward from near the rear end of the main frame, and also has a swing-type power unit which combines an engine and a power transmission and supports them on the body frame in a vertically swingable manner, in which the left and right rear frames are asymmetrical to each other as viewed sideways to obtain a clearance with accessories which swing together with the engine during swinging motion (for example, see Patent Documents 1 and 2).<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No.H3-132492<br>
[Patent Document 2] WO2004/071858 pamphlet [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
Recently scooter type vehicles have often adopted an<br><br>
electronically-controlled fuel injection system instead of a conventional carburetor.<br>
When the fuel injection system is adopted, it is desirable its fuel injection valve, fuel hose and so on be arranged paying due consideration to piping and connection â–  work for them because high pressure fuel is supplied, and it is also desirable that its structure be suitable for a scooter type vehicle with left and right rear frames asymmetrical to each other as   viewed sideways.<br>
Therefore, the present invention has an object to enhance the working efficiency for the fuel injection system in a scooter type vehicle having a body frame with mutually asymmetrical left and right rear frames. [Means for Solving the Problem] [0004]<br>
As a means to solve the above problem, the invention as described in Claim 1 is characterized in that in a scooter type vehicle (for example, a motorcycle 1 in an embodiment) which has a body frame (for example, a body frame 2 in the embodiment) including a head pipe (for example, a head pipe 3 in the embodiment) which supports a steering wheel (for example, a front wheel 4 in the embodiment) , a main frame (for example, a main frame 7 in the embodiment) extending obliquely downward and backward from the head pipe, and left and right rear frames (for example, left and right rear frames 11 and 12 in the emibodiment) extending obliquely upward and backward from near the rear end of the main frame, wirh the left and<br><br>
right rear frames being different in shape from each other as viewed sideways, the intake system of an engine (for example, an engine 31 in the embodiment) has a fuel injection system, and the fuel injection valve (for example, an injector 69 in the embodiment) of the fuel injection system is located between the outer edges of the left and right rear frames as viewed sideways.<br>
[0005]<br>
The invention as described in Claim 2 is characterized in that the body frame has a cross member<br>
(for example, a front cross member 17 in the embodiment) across between the asymmetrical portions (for example, left and right upright parts 11a and 12a in the embodiment) of the left and right rear frames and the fuel injection vale is located overlapping the cross member as viewed sideways.<br>
[0006]<br>
The invention as described in Claim 3 is characterized in that the cross member curves obliquely upward and forward in a convex form and the fuel injection valve is located between the asymmetrical portions of the left and right rear frames as viewed from above and inside the cross member's curved inner edge.<br>
[0007]<br>
The invention as described in Claim 4 is characterized in that it includes a fuel tank (for example, a fuel tank 15 in the embodiment) which stores fuel for the engine; and a fuel hose {for example, a fuel hose 61 in the embodiment} which connects the fuel tank and the fuel<br><br>
injection valve, and the fuel tank is supported on the rear parts of the left and right rear frames (for example, left and right upper frame parts l1b and 12b in the embodiment), the fore parts (for example, left and right upright pans 11a and 12a in the embodiment) of the left and right rear frames are asymmetrical to each other as viewed sideways, the fuel injection valve lies between the fore parts of the left and right rear frames, the fore part of one of the left and right rear frames  (for example, the left upright part 11a in the embodiment) is in a lower position than the fore part of the other [for example the right upright part 12a in the embodiment} as viewed sideways, and the fuel hose lies along the one left rear frame. [0008]<br>
The invention as described in Claim 5 is characterized in that it includes a swing-type power unit (for example, a swing unit 30 in the embodiment) which combines the engine and a power transmission (for example, a power transmission 35 in the embodiment) and supports them on the body frame in a vertically swingable m.anner, and the engine's cylinder head (for example, a cylinder head 33b in the embodiment) lies between the fore parts of the left and right rear frames, and the fuel hose detours around the cylinder head's front of the engine and joins the fuel injection valve. [0009]<br>
The invention as described in Claim 6 is characterized in that it includes an article storage box<br><br>
(for example, an article storage box 14 in the embodirrient) located above the fore parts of the left and right rear frames, and the body frame has a cross member (for example, a front cross member 17 in the erribodiment) across between the fore parts of the left and right rear frames, and the article storage box is supported by che cross member, and the fuel injection valve is located overlapping the cross member as viewed sideways. [Effect of the Invention] [0010]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 1, since the fuel injection valve   is   located between the outer edges of the left and right rear frames different in shape from each other as viewed sideways, it is easier to obtain space for access to the fuel injection valve and its vicinity (particularly the top and bottom of the fuel injection valve) from right or left of the vehicle, which is advantageous in terms of working space for the fuel injection valve.  Therefore, maintenance of the fuel injection valve and connection of the fuel hose can be easily done and the degree of freedom in determining the direction of connection of the fuel hose to the fuel injection valve is increased.  Besides, in case that the engine swings vertically with respect to the body frame, while it is swinging, the fuel injection valve easily overlaps one of the left and right rear frames as viewed sideways and the fuel injection valve is thus protected and while it is still, the fuel injection valve can be easily<br><br>
checked.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 2, lateral exposure of the fuel injection valve is suppressed and   the influence of   lateral disturbance is reduced.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 3, since the fuel injection valve is surrounded by the left and right rear frames and the cross member, the influence of lateral disturbance on the fuel injection valve is reduced and a wider working space is obtained for the fuel injection valve.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 4, connection of the fuel hose to the fuel injection valve located between the asymmetrical portions (fore parts) of the left and right rear frames can be done from the side of the rear frame with its asymmetrical portion in the lower position and connection of the fuel hose is easy.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 5, the fuel hose is slack enough to bend easily while the engine is swinging.<br>
[D015]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 6, the cross member supporting the article storage box is used to reduce the influence of lateral disturbance on the fuel injection valve and the article storage box protects the<br><br>
upper part of the fuel injection valve. [Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention] [0016]<br>
Hext, an embodiment of -he present invention will be described referring to drawings.  In the explanation give below, directions such as longitudinal (front-back) and transverse (left-right) directions are the same as the directions in the vehicle unless otherwise specified.  Also, in the figureS arrow FR indicates the vehicle's frontward direction, arrow LH indicates the vehicle's left-hand direction, arrow UP indicates the vehicle's upward direction and line CS indicates the vehicle's center plane in the transverse direction. [O017]<br>
In a scooter type motorcycle (scooter type vehicle) 1 shown in Fig. 1, left and right front forks 5 to which a front wheel 4 is journaled are pivotally supported by a head pipe 3 located at the front end cf a body frame 2 through a steering stem 5a in a steerable manner. A steering handlebar 6 is attached to the top of the steering stem 5a. [0018]<br>
The body frame 2, constructed by uniting several types of steel members by welding or another method, has one main frame 7 stretching obliquely downward and backward from the head pipe 3 and has a low part between the head pipe 3 and a seat 13 for an occupant to permit the occupant to straddle more easily, thus constituting an underbone<br><br>
type vehicle.  A floor step 54 on which the feet of the occupant (rider) seated on the seat 13 rest is provided on the low part. [00191<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 and 5 as well, the rear end of the main frame 7 is joined to the transverse middle of a transversely extending cross frame 8 in the longitudinal middle of the bottom of the vehicle body.  Left and right pivot plates 9 which support the fore part of a swing unit 30 through a suspension link 41 in a vertically swingable manner are joined to the left and right ends   of   the  cross frame 8. [0020]<br>
The front ends of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 are joined to the left and right ends of the cross frame 8 respectively.  The left and right rear frames 11 and 12 stretch obliquely upward and backward from the cross frame 8.  The seat 13, having front and rear seat surfaces for the rider and pillion passenger, is located above the left and right rear frames 11 and 12.  An article storage box 14 is located below the fore part of the seat 13 and a fuel tank 15 is located below the rear part of the seat 13. [0021]<br>
Here, the body frame 2 is mainly composed of: the head pipe 3 located at its front end; the one main frame 7 extending obliquely downward and backward from the head pipe 3, curving near the floor step 54   and extending backward; the cross frame 8 extending transversely in the<br><br>
longitudinal middle of the bottom of the vehicle body and joining the rear end of the main frame 7 in the transverse middle; the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 extending obliquely upward and backward from the left and right ends of the cross frame 8; the left and right pivot plates 9 joined across between the left and right ends of the cross frame 8 and the outer sides of the front ends (lower ends) of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12; left and right floor frames 15 provided across between the lower part of the main frame 7 and the outer sides of the left and right front ends of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12; a front cross member 17 provided across between the fore parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12; a center cross member 18 provided across between the middle parts of the left and right rear framies 11 and 12; and a rear cross member 19 provided across between the rear ends of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12. [0022]<br>
The head pipe 3 takes the form of a circular pipe with its upper part tilted backward.  The upper end (front end) of the main frame 7, also in the form of a circular pipe, is joined to the vertical middle of the back of the head pipe 3.  In the figures, reference numeral 3a represents a gusset across   between the lower back of the head pipe 3 and the top fore part (front end lower part) of the main frame 7. [0023]<br>
The main frame 7 integrally has a down frame part 7a<br><br>
extending ob11quely downward   and  backward from   the head pipe 3 and a lower frame part 7b curving backward from the lower end of the down frame part 7a where the lower end of the lower frame part 7b is joined LO the front of the transverse middle of   the circular pipe cross frame S.  In the figures, reference numeral 8a represents a vertical gusset across between the rear end of the main frame 7 and the transverse middle of the cross frame 8. [0024]<br>
The left and right rear frames 11 and 12 take the form of square pipes and their fore parts constitute left and right upright parts 11a and 12a relatively steeply extending ob11quely upward and backward from both ends of the cross frame 8 and their rear parts constitute left and right upper frame parts l1b and 12b curving from the upper ends (rear ends) of the left and right upright parts 11a and 12a and relatively gradually extending ob11quely upward and backward.  The left rear frame 11 is a s11ghtly thicker square pipe than the right rear frame 12. 10025}<br>
Here, the left and right upright parts 11a and 12s are asymmetrical to each other as viewed sideways.<br>
More specifically, as shown in Figs. 1 to 3, the left upright part 11a extends ob11quely upward and backward from the cross frame 8 11nearly as viewed sideways and its upper end (rear end) curves and joins the front end of the left upper frame part 11b.  On the other hand, the right upright part 12a curves ob11quely upward and forward in a convex<br><br>
form and extends ob11quely upward and backward from the cross frame 8 as viwed sideways and its upper end (rear end) curves and joins the front end of the right upper frame part 12b. [0026]<br>
The left and right upper frame parts 11b and 12b are almost symmetrical as viewed sideways; therefore the right upright part 12a, curved as mentioned above, stands ob11quely above and ahead of the 11near left upright part 11a as viewed sideways.  In other words, the left upright part 11a stands ob11quely below and behind the right upright part 12a as viewed sideways.<br>
The left and right rear frames 11 and 12 area parallel to each other as viewed from above and extend longitudinally; however the left rear frame 11 is transversely in a s11ghtly more outer position than the right rear frame 12. [0027]<br>
Left and right step brackets 21 supporting left and right steps 21c for a passenger are attached to the left and right outer sides of the upper parts of the left and right upright parts 11a and 12a respectively.<br>
The left and right step brackets 21 each have a lower pipe 21a tilting backward and downward as   viewed sideways and an upper pipe 21b extending upward from the bottorri of the lower pipe 21a and the upper ends of these pipes 21a and 21b are connected with the left and right outer sides of the left and right upright parts lla and 12a with bolts.<br><br>
[0028]<br>
Referring to Figs. 4   ana   5 as well, the lower parts of the left and right step brackets 21 protrude outward left and right to obtain a clearance with an intake duct 71 (explained later) and the radiator 43 which are located below and transversely inside the left and right step brackets 21.<br>
The passenger step 21c supported on the lower end of each lower pipe 21a can be turned from its service position (it protrudes almost   horizontally outward in the vehicle width direction) to its collapsed position (it is tilted backward and upward) and vice versa. [0029]<br>
The left and right pivot plates 9 take the form of a plate which is almost perpendicular to the transverse direction and their front ends are joined   to the left and right ends of the cross frame 8 respectively and their upper parts extend along the lower ends of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 respectively.  In other words, the left and right pivot plates 9 are asymmetrical to each other. [0030]<br>
The left and right outer faces of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 are almost flush with the left and right ends of the cross frame 8, and the left and right outer faces of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 are joined to the front edges of the upper extensions of the left and right pivot plates 9.  The left and right pivot<br><br>
plates 9 also function as gussets at the joints between the left and right ends of the cross frame 8 and the lower ends of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12. The fore part of the swing unit 30 is supported on the lower back of each of the left and right pivot plates 9 through a suspension 11nk 41.<br>
A side stand (not shown) which holds the vehicle body in a left-tilted standing position is supported on the transversely outer side of the left pivot plate 9 in a turnable (collapsible) manner. [0031]<br>
The left and right floor frames 16, taking the form of a circular pipe, tilt forward and downward as viewed sideways and tilt in a way that their rear parts are transversely in a more outer position than their fore parts as viewed from above.  The front ends of the left and right floor frames 16 curve inward in the transverse direction and the front ends are joined to the lower front sides of the main frame 7 from left and right and outside.  On the other hand, the rear ends of the left and right floor frames 16 are joined to the vicinities of the lower ends of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 through left and right connection pipes 16a from left and right and outside.<br>
The left and right floor frames 16 are almost symmetrical and the floor step 54 is located over the left and right floor frames 16. [0032]<br>
The front cross member 17, taking the form of a<br><br>
circular pipe, curves ob11quely upward and forward in a convex fcrm.  The right end of the front cross member 17 is joined to the vicinity of the apex of the curve of the right upright part 12a as viewed sideways from inside in the transverse direction and the left end of the front cross merriber 17 is joined to the longitudinal middle of the left upright part 11a of the left rear frame 11, located in a lower position than the right upright part 12a as viewed sideways, ob11quely from ahead and above.  Thus it may be said that the front cross member 17 11es across the largest space between the left and right upright parts 11a and 12a, asymmetrical to each other as viewed sideways, tilting forward and upward as viewed sideways.<br>
A pair of left and right support brackets 17a for supporting the front side of the bottom of the article storage box 14 are provided in the longitudinal middle of the front cross member 17. [0033]<br>
The center cross member 18, taking the form of a circular pipe, extends 11nearly along the transverse direction and its left and right ends are joined to the longitudinal middle of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 from inside in the transverse direction.  A pair of left and right support brackets 18a for supporting the front flange of the fuel tank 15 are provided in the transverse middle of the center cross member 18.<br>
The rear cross member 19&gt; appropriately formed as a box made of sheet steel, has both ends joined to the rear<br><br>
ends of the left and right rear fraines 11 and 12 from above. The transverse middle portion of the rear cross member 19 supports the rear flange of the fuel tank 15 and also supports a lock mechanism   (net shown) which holds the turnable seat 13 in a closed state (state in which the occupant can be seated). [0034]<br>
Referring to Figs. 1 to 3, the swing unit 30 is a swing type power unit which combines the engine 31 in its fore part and the power transmission 35 in its rear left part and the fore part is supported by the left and right pivot plates 9 through the suspension 11nk 41 in a vertically swingable manner and its rear left part is supported by the left rear frame 11 through a rear cushion 42   in a way that it can come closer to or go away from the left rear frame 11.  In the figures, reference numeral 11e represents a cushion support bracket provided at the rear lower side of the left rear frame 11. [0035]<br>
The engine [internal combustion) 31 is a water-cooled single cy11nder engine with its crankshaft rotation axis 11ne {crankshaft 11ne) CI running along the transverse direction (vehicle width direction), which has a basic structure that the cy11nder 33, oriented forward, protrudes almost horizontally (more specifically, s11ghtly tilted forward and upward) from the front end of its crankcase 32. In the figures, reference symbol C2 represents the axis 11ne (cy11nder axis 11ne) along which the cy11nder 33<br><br>
protrudes. [0036]<br>
The cy11nder 33 includes: a cy11nder main body 33a directly attached to the front end of the crankcase 32; a cy11nder head 33b attached to the front end of the cy11nder main foody 33s;   and a head cover 33c attached to the r'ront end of the cy11nder head 33b.  The cy11nder 33 is located between the upright parts 11a and 12a of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and the left upright part 11a, in a lower position than the right upright pert 12a, overlaps the cy11nder head 33b as viewed sideways.<br>
A piston is reciprocably placed in the cy11nder main body 33a and reciprocating motion of the piston is converted into rotary motion of the crankshaft through a connecting rod {these are not shown). [0037]<br>
The fore part of the transmission case 34 extending backward is integrally provided on the left of the crankcase 32,  The transmiission case 34 houses a belt type continuously variable transmission 36 of the power transmission 35.  A gear case 34a is integrally provided at the rear end of the transmission case 34 and the gear case 34a houses a reduction gear (not shown) of the power transmission 35. [0038]<br>
The rotational power of the crankshaft of the engine 31 is transmitted through the belt type continuously variable transmission 35 to the reduction gear and<br><br>
outputted to an output shaft (rear wheel axle) 38a protruding inward in the transverse direction from the gear case 34a, to drive the rear wheel (drive wheel) 38 attached to the shaft 38a to run the jTiOtorcycle I.  In the figures, reference numeral 39 represents the kick arm of a kick starter located transversely outside the transmission case 34. [0039]<br>
The swing unit 30 can vertically swing around the suspension 11nk 41 together with the rear wheel 38, constituting a so-called unit swing type rear suspension. The left and right rear frames 11 and 12 of the body frame 2 and their vicinities are asymmetrical mainly because the rear suspension has an asymmetrical structure and a clearance is obtained between the radistor 43 (explained later) and the right rear frame 12 while the swing unit 30 is swinging. [0040]<br>
The drive pulley 36a of the belt type continuously variable transmission 36 is coaxially provided on the left of   the crankshaft and   a fan (not shown) for introducing coo11ng air into the transmission case 34 is provided transversely outside the drive pulley 36a.  An intake hole 34b for the coo11ng air is provided transversely outside the front end of the transmission case 34 and an exhaust hole 34c for the coo11ng air is provided on its reat bottom. [0041]<br>
On the other hand, the radiator 43 for coo11ng the<br><br>
engine 31 is located on the right cf the crankcase 32.  In order to obtain a clearance when this radiator 43 vertically swings together with the- swing unit 30, the fore part (right upright part 12a) cf the right rear frame 12 or the body frame 2 extends ob11quely above and ahead of it curving in a convex form as viewed sideways.  A generator is coaxially provided on the right of the crankshaft and the fan for supplying coo11ng air to the radiator 43 is located transversely outside the generator (these are not shewn).  A reservoir tank 43 for storing radiator 11quid is located transversely outside the longitudinal middle portion of the right rear fra:r^e 12. [0042]<br>
A 11nk coup11ng 32a which protrudes downward and extends forward is provided on the fore lower side of the swing unit 30 (lower part of the crankcase 32 of the engine 31).  The rear end of the suspension 11nk 41 is coupled with the 11nk coup11ng 32a and the front end of the suspension 11nk 41 is coupled with the left (right) pivot plate 9.  The swing unit 30 can vertically swing around this suspension 11nk 41. [0043]<br>
The front and rear ends of the suspension 11nk 41 are coupled with the body frame 2 or swing unit 30 in a vertically swingable manner respectively and at least one of them is supported by the body frame 2 or swing unit 30 through a rubber bush or the 11ke elastically and in a vertically swingable manner.  Also, a main stand 32b v/hich<br><br>
holds the vehicle body upright is supported turnably<br>
(collapsably) below the 11r.k coup11ng 32a.<br>
[00^4]<br>
The body frame 2 is covered by a body cover 50 mainly made of synthetic resin.<br>
The body cover 50 is mainly composed of: a front cover 51 which covers the fore part of the body frame 2<br>
{the head pipe 3 and the main frame 7's down frame part 7a and its vicinity) from ahead of it; an inner cover 52 which covers the fore part of the body frame 2 from behind; an under cover 53 which covers the lower part of the body frame 2 (the main frame 7's lower frame part 7b and the left and right floor frames 15 and their vicinities} from under; the floor step 54 which covers the lower part of the body frame 2 from above; a rear center cover 55 which covers the rear fore part of the body frame 2 (upright parts 11a and 12a of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and their vicinities) from ahead; and left and right rear side covers 56 which cover the rear part of the body frame 2 (left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and their vicinities) laterally.<br>
[0045]<br>
The seat 13 is supported on the rear center cover 55 and the left and right rear side covers 56. Also, the front end of the seat 13 is turnably supported by the rear center cover 55. The article storage box 14 and fuel tank 15 are surrounded by the rear center cover 55 and left and right rear side covers 56, and the article storage box 14<br><br>
and fuel tank 15, located under the seat 13, can be accessed by turning the seat 13 in its seatsble position so as for its rear part to swing upvjard. [0045]<br>
The article storage box 13 takes the form of a box which opens upward and its upper part is supported by the rear center cover 55 and left and right rear side covers 56 as   appropriate and its lower part (bottom) is supported by the left and right support brackets ITa of the front cross member 17. [0047]<br>
The fuel tank 15 is located between the rear parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 {between the left and right upper frame parts 11b and 12b) and its front flange is elastically supported by the left and right support brackets 18a of the center cross member 18 and its rear flange is elastically supported by the rear cross member 19.  In the figures, reference numeral 15a represents a fuel pump facing the inside of the fore part of the fuel tank 15 and reference numeral 15b represents a filler hole on the top of the rear part of the fuel tank 15.<br>
A fuel hose 61 is connected to the fuel tank 15 (fuel pump 15a) and the fuel hose 61 runs on and along the left rear frame 11 to the vicinity of the front cross member 17. [0048]<br>
Here, the lower edges of the left and right rear side covers 56 take the form of a circular arc with a relatively large radius along the outer periphery of the rear wheel 28<br><br>
as viewed sideways and the portion of the left (right) rear side cover 56 which overlaps the step bracket 21 as viewed sideways has a cover extension 563 which extends to the vicininy of the lower end of the step bracket 21 and covers it from left (right) and outside. [00^59]<br>
A throttle body 62 is located above the cy11nder main body 33a of the engine 31 and the front end {downstream side) of the throttle body 62 is connected with an intake port (not shown) on the top of the cy11nder head 33b through an insulator 63.  The rear end (upstream side) of the throttle body 62 is connected to the air cleaner 64 located behind it.<br>
On the other hand, an exhaust port (not shown) on the bottom of the cy11nder head 33b is connected with the base end of an exhaust pipe 44 and the exhaust pipe 44 curves under the cy11nder 33 and extends backward with its tip connected with a silencer 45 on the right of the rear wheel 38. [0050]<br>
The air cleaner 64 is mainly composed of a box type air cleaner case 65, a plate air cleaner element 66 housed in the air cleaner case 65, and a cy11ndrical connecting tube 67 for taking external air out of the air cleaner case 65. [0051]<br>
Referring to Figs. 4 and 5 as well, the air cleaner case 65, made of, for example, synthetic resin, includes a<br><br>
esse body 65a located above the transmission case 34 and an inward extension 65b extending from the case body 65a invjard in the vehicle width direction.  In the case body 65a, the air cleaner element 66 of urethane foam material is held upright almost perpendicularly to the transverse direction.  The inner space of the air cleaner case 65 is divided into a dirty side, upstream of the air cleaner element 65 (transversely outer side), and a clean side, downstream of it (transversely inner side).  The front end of the case body 65a has a hole 68 for introducing external air into the dirty side of the air cleaner case 65, which is oriented ob11quely downward and forward. [0052]<br>
The connecting tube 67, made of, for example, a flexible material such as rubber, extends forward from the inward extension 65b of the air cleaner case 65 to the upstream end of the throttle body ^2.<br>
The throttle body 62 is m.ade of, for example, aluminum alloy and the upstream end of its cy11ndrical main body is fitted to the tip of the connecting tube 67 and its downstream end is fitted to the upstream end of the cy11ndrical insulator 63 made cf, for example, a flexible material such as rubber.  Inside the throttle body 62, an intake path with its fore part s11ghtly tilted down is formed and a butterfly throttle valve which opens and closes the intake path is provided (these are not shown). [0053]<br>
The insulator 53 lets the intake path with its fore<br><br>
part slightly tilted down from the throttle body 62 curve downward and join the intake port of the engine 31.  The downstream end cf the insularor 63 is fixed on the top of rhe cylinder head 33b  with a bolt or the like.  The insulator 63 has an injector (fuel injection valve) 69 which injects fuel into the intake path inside it is niounted on its curved periphery. [0054]<br>
In other words, the motorcycle 1 employs an electronically-controlled fuel injection system for the intake system (fuel supply system) of the engine 31 so that an electronic control unit (not shown) activates the injector 69 and controls the fu_el supply rate and fuel<br><br>
The injector 69, taking the form of a rod, is located obliquely forward and upward from the insulator 63, where its fore part is tilted upward and its lower part penetrates the outer wall of the insulator 63 and the injection hole at the lower end faces the inside of the intake path. [0055]<br>
Here, the injector 69 lies transversely inside the front cross  member 17, overlapping the front cross  member 17 as viewed sideways.  In other words, the injector 69 lies between the portions of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 (left and right upright parts 11a and 12a), mutually asymmetrical as viewed sideways, between which the<br><br>
distance is the largest, and 11es in the space foritied by the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 asymmetrical as viewed sideways (space between the lower edge of the left rear frame 11 (left upright part 11a) and the upper edge of the right rear frame 12 (right upright part 12a) . [0056]<br>
The injector 69, located in such a position, overlaps either of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 as viewed sideways while the swing unit 30 is swinging, which means that it is less susceptible to lateral disturbance and easily handled laterally while the swing unit 30 is still.<br>
Furthermore, the fore part of the injector 69 tilts upward in the same way as the front cross member 17, as viewed sideways.  Since the fore part of the front cross member 17 tilts upward, it is easy to obtain a sufficient clearance between the injector 69 and the article storage box 14 while the swing unit 30 is swinging.  The upper part of the injector 59 is protected by the article storage box 14 . [0057]<br>
The fuel hose 61 extending from the fuel pump 15a runs on the left rear frame 11 and at a point near the front cross member 17, it turns toward the inside of the front cross member 17 in the transverse direction and at a point near the head cover 33c, it curves right and turns backward in a way to detour around the front of the cy11nder head 33b and joins the joint on the top of the<br><br>
injector 69 from right and above with a sufficient hose length.  Since the fuel hose 61 runs along the left rear frame 11, ~he s11ghtly thicker one of the square pipe left and right rear frames 11 and 12 which are taken the form of square pipes, it 11es on the relatively wide flat surface of the left rear frame 11 and it is easy to support nhe fuel hose 61 stably. [0058]<br>
Furthermore, an intake duct 71 which enables introduction of external air (coo11ng air) into the transmission case 34 by a fan provided on the drive pulley 36a of the belt continuously variable transmission is attached to the transversely outer side of the front end of the transmission case 34.<br>
The intake duct 71 has its base end attached around the intake hole 34b which opens on the transversely outer side of the front end of the transmission case 34, and turns transversely inward from the base end, extending upward, and has an external air intake hole 72 on the transversely inner side of this extension.  This external air intake hole 72 is located in front of and near the external air intake hole 68 of the air cleaner 64 as viewed sideways.  While the external air intake hole 72 of the intake duct 71 is located transversely more inward than the left rear   frame 11, the external air intake hole   68 of the air cleaner 64 is almost in a position to overlap the left rear frame 11 in the transverse direction. [0059]<br><br>
F'jrthermore, the intake duct 71 is located so that its external intalce hole 72 and its vicinity overlap the lower part of the nhrottle body 62 as viewed sideways.  The step bracket 21 and cover extension 55a are located en the transversely outer sides of the throttle body 62 and the external air intake hole 72 of the intake duct 71 and their vicinities, suppressing the influence of disturbance on the throttle body 62 and intake duct 71. [0060]<br>
As explained above, the scooter type vehicle (motorcycle 1) in the above embodiment has the body frame 12 including the head pipe 3 which supports the steering wheel (front wheel 4),    the main frame 7 extending ob11quely downward and backward from the head pipe 3, and the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 extending ob11quely upward and backward from near the rear end of the main frame 7, characterized in that the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 are asymmetrical to each other as viewed sideways and the intake system of the engine 31 has the fuel injection system, and the injector 69 in the fuel injection system is located in the space formed by the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 as viewed sideways. [0061]<br>
In this structure, the injector 69 is located in the space formed by the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 asymmetrical to each other as viewed sideways, so the space around the injector 69   can  be wide, providing a wider working space for the injector 69.  Therefore, maintenance<br><br>
of the injector 69 and connection of the fuel hose 61 can be easily done and the degree of freedom in determining the direction of connection of the fuel hose 61 to the injector 69 is increased. [0062J<br>
In the above scooter type vehicle, since the body frame 2 has a front cross member 17 across between the asymmetrical portions of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and the injector 59 is located overlapping the front cross   member   17 as   viewed sideways, lateral exposure of the injector 69 is suppressed, the appearance is improved and the influence of lateral disturbance is reduced. [0053]<br>
In addition, in the above scooter type vehicle, the front cross  member   17 curves ob11quely upward and forward in a convex form and the injector 69 is located between the asymmetrical portions of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 (left and right upright parts 11a and 12a) and inside the curved inner edge of the front cross member 17, so   the injector 69   is surrounded  by  the   left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and the front cross member 17 and consequently the injector 69 is less conspicuous and the influence of lateral disturbance is reduced and a wider working space for the injector 59 is assured. [0064]<br>
Furthermore, the scooter type vehicle has the fuel tank 15 which stores fuel for the engine 31 and the fuel hose 61 which connects the fuel tank 15 and the injector 69,<br><br>
where the fuel tank 15 is supported on the rear parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12, the fore parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12   are   asymmetrical to each other as vievjed sideways, and the injector 69 11es between the fore parts of the left and   right rear frames 11 and 12, the fore part of one of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 (upright part 11a of the left rear frame 11) is in a lower position than the fore part of the other (upright part 12a of the right rear frame 12) as viewed sideways, and the fuel hose 61 runs along the left rear frame 11, so connection of the fuel hose 61 to the injector 69 between the asymmetrical portions (fore parts) of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 can be done from the side of the rear frame (left rear frame 11) with its asymmetrical part in the lower position than the other (right rear frame 12), thus miaking connection of the fuel hose 61 easy. [0065]<br>
Besides, the above scooter type vehicle includes the swing unit 30   which combines the engine 31 and the power transmission 35 and supports them on the body frame 2 in a vertically swingable manner where the cy11nder head 33b of the engine 31 11es between the fore parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and the fuel hose 61 detours around the front of the cy11nder head 33b of the engine 31 and joins the injector 69, so the fuel hose 61 can be slack enough to bend easily while the engine 31 is swinging. [0066]<br><br>
In the above scooter type vehicle, since the article storage bo: 14 is located above the fore parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 and the body frame 2 has the front cross iTiember 17 across between the fere parts of the left and right rear frames 11 and 12, the article storage box 14 is supported by the front cross merrsber 17, and the injector 69 is located overlapping the front cross member 17 as viewed sideways, the front cross member 17 supporting the article storage box 14 is used to prevent lateral exposure of the injector 69 to improve the appearance and reduce the influence of lateral disturbance. [0067]<br>
The present invention is not 11mited to the above embodiment; for example, the main frame 7 and the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 may each be a combination of several members.<br>
Alternatively, it is also possible that the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 skirt the accessories other than the radiator 43 (intake and exhaust system parts, electronic parts and so on) and are asymmetrical to each other .<br>
It is also possible that the relation between the left and right rear frames 11 and 12 is reversed, namely the right rear frame 12 is smaller in height than the left rear frame 11 and the fuel hose 61 runs along the right rear frame 12.<br>
In the motorcycle 1, it is also possible that the engine 31 is supported and fiKed on the body fram.e 2 and<br><br>
