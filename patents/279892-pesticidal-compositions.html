				<td>DESCRIPTION PESTICIDAL COMPOSITIONS TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to pesticidal compositions comprising anthranilamide compounds of the formula (I) described hereinafter or their salts and other pesticides. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, an organophosphorus compound, a carbamate compound, a pyrethroid compound or the like has been used as an effective ingredient for an insecticide, but as this result, some insects have had a resistance to these insecticides in recent years.  Therefore, it is demanded to provide an insecticide effective for these insects having a resistance.<br>
An anthranilamide compound of the formula (I) described hereinafter or its salt is disclosed in Patent Document 1.  Further, Patent Document 2 discloses in test A and test C at pages 83 to 85 a controlling effect of a combination of a specific anthranilamide compound with imidacloprid or thiamethoxam against diamondback moth or aphid.<br>
Patent Document 1:  WO2005/077934<br>
Patent Document 2:  WO2006/055922 DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
Conventional pesticides have respectively characteristic spectrums and effects, but have some problems that the effects are sometimes unsatisfactory to certain pests, that their residual activities are sometimes poor and the effects are not satisfactorily maintained for a certain period of time, and that satisfactory pesticidal effects can not be practically achieved depending on applications.  Also, even if there are some pesticides excellent in their pesticidal effects, they are demanded to be improved in respect of safety to fishes, Crustacea and domestic animals and are also demanded to achieve a high pesticidal effect at a small dosage.<br>
 <br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied to solve these problems, and as a result of the study, they have discovered that by combining an anthranilamide compound of the following formula (I) or its salt with other pesticide, unexpected effects of killing pests grown in some place by one time and reducing a dosage than in a case of using an active compound respectively alone, can be achieved.  The present invention has been accomplished on the basis of this discovery.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a pesticidal composition comprising<br>
synergistically effective amounts of at least one anthranilamide compound<br>
represented by the formula (I) or its salt and other pesticide:<br>
R2<br>
R*       II   f\    ,<br>
*     (o)â€ž    
wherein each of Rla and Rlb which are independent of each other, is halogen; each of R2 and R3 is halogen, alkyl, haloalkyl, alkoxy, haloalkoxy or cyano; A is alkyl substituted by Y; Y is C3_4 cycloalkyl which may be substituted by at least one substituent selected from the group consisting of halogen, alkyl and haloalkyl; n is 0 or 1; and q is an integer of from 0 to 4; provided that Rla and Rlb are not simultaneously chlorine nor bromine.  The present invention further provides a method for controlling pests by applying synergistically effective amounts of the above anthranilamide compound or its salt and other pesticide.<br>
In the above formula (I), the number of substituents Y in A may be 1 or more, and if more, the respective substituents Y may be the same or different. Further, the positions for substitution of the substituents Y may be any positions.  The number of substituents Y in A is preferably 1.<br>
The number of halogen, alkyl or haloalkyl as the substituent for the C3_4 cycloalkyl in Y, may be 1 or more, and if more, the respective substituents may<br>
 <br>
be the same or different.  Further, the positions for substitution for the respective substituents may be any positions.  The C3_4 cycloalkyl in Y is preferably unsubstituted, or when it has the above substituents, the number of such substituents is preferably from 1 to 5.<br>
As the halogen or halogen as the substituent in Rla, Rlb, R2, R3 or Y, an atom of fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine may be mentioned.  The number of halogens as substituents may be 1 or more, and if more, the respective halogens may be the same or different.  Further, the positions for substitution of such halogens may be any positions.<br>
In the above formula (I), the alkyl or alkyl moiety in R2, R3, A or Y may be linear or branched.  As its specific example, Ci_6 alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl or hexyl may be mentioned.<br>
As a specific example of the C3_4 cycloalkyl or cycloalkyl moiety in Y, cyclopropyl or cyclobutyl may be mentioned, and cyclopropyl is particularly preferred.<br>
The salt of the anthranilamide compound of the above formula (I) includes all kinds so long as they are agriculturally acceptable.  For example, an alkali metal salt such as a sodium salt or a potassium salt; an alkaline earth metal salt such as a magnesium salt or a calcium salt; an ammonium salt such as a dimethylammonium salt or a triethylammonium salt; an inorganic acid salt such as a hydrochloride, a perchlorate, a sulfate or a nitrate; or an organic acid salt such as an acetate or a methanesulfonate, may be mentioned.<br>
The anthranilamide compound of the formula (I) may have optical isomers or geometrical isomers, and such isomers and mixtures thereof are both included in the present invention.  Further, in the present invention, various isomers other than those mentioned above, may be included within the scope of the common knowledge in this technical field.  Further, depending upon the type of such an isomer, the chemical structure may be different from the above-mentioned formula (I), but it is obvious to one skilled in the art that such a structure is in isomeric relation and thus falls within the scope of the present invention.<br>
 <br>
The anthranilamide compound of the above formula (I) or its salt can be obtained by the method disclosed in Patent Document 1. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>

Preferred embodiments of the pesticidal compositions of the present invention are described below.  The compositions of the present invention are particularly useful, for example, as agents for controlling various pests which become problematic in the agricultural and horticultural fields, i.e. agricultural and horticultural pesticides, agents for controlling sanitary insect pests which are sanitarily harmful to the human, i.e. control agents against sanitary insect pests, agents for controlling pests harmful to trees and turf, i.e. control agents against pests on trees and turf, agents for controlling pests harmful to clothes and household goods, i.e. control agents against clothes and household goods insect pests, and agents for controlling pests which are parasitic on animals i.e. pesticides against parasites on animals.<br>
The agricultural and horticultural pesticides are useful as an insecticide, a miticide, a nematicide, a soil pesticide and a fungicide, and they are effective for controlling plant parasitic mites such as two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae), carmine spider mite (Tetranychus cinnabarinus), kanzawa spider mite (Tetranychus kanzawai), citrus red mite (Panonychus citri), European red mite (Panonychus ulmi), broad mite (Polyphagotarsonemus latus), pink citrus rust mite (Aculops pelekassi) and bulb mite (Rhizoglyphus echinopus); agricultural insect pests such as diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), cabbage armyworm (Mamestra brassicae), common cutworm (Spodoptera litura), codling moth (Laspeyresia pomonella), bollworm (Heliothis zea),<br>
 <br>
tobacco budworm (Heliothis virescens), gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar), rice leafroller (Cnaphalocrocis medinalis), smaller tea tortrix (Adoxophyes sp.), summer fruit tortrix (Adoxophyes orana fasciata), peach fruit moth (Carposina niponensis), oriental fruit moth (Grapholita molesta), black cutworm (Agrotis ipsilon), cutworm (Agrotis segetum), Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata), cucurbit leaf beetle (Aulacophora femoralis), boll weevil<br>
(Anthonomus grandis), aphids, planthoppers, leafhoppers, scales, bugs, whiteflies, thrips, grasshoppers, anthomyiid flies, scarabs, ants, leafminer flies; plant parasitic nematodes such as root-knot nematodes, cyst nematodes, root-lesion nematodes, rice white-tip nematode (Aphelenchoides besseyi), strawberry bud nematode (Nothotylenchus acris), pine wood nematode<br>
(Bursaphelenchus xylophilus); gastropods such as slugs and snails; soil pests such as isopods such as pillbugs (Armadilidium vulgare) and pillbugs (Porcellio scaber); stored grain insect pests such as angoumois grai moth (Sitotroga cerealella), adzuki bean weevil (Callosobruchus chinensis), red flour beetle<br>
(Tribolium castaneum) and mealworms.<br>
Further, as the fungicides, they are effective for controlling diseases such as blast, brown spot or sheath blight of rice (Oryza sativa, etc.); powdery mildew, scab, rust, snow mold, snow blight, loose smut, eye spot, leaf spot or glume blotch of cereals (Hordeum vulgare, Tricum aestivum, etc.); melanose or scab of citrus (Citrus spp., etc.); blossom blight, powdery mildew, Alternaria leaf spot or scab of apple (Malus pumila); scab or black spot of pear (Pyrus serotina, Pyrus ussuriensis, Pyrus communis); brown rot, scab or Phomopsis rot of peach (Prunus persica, etc.); anthracnose, ripe rot, powdery mildew or downy mildew of grape (Vitis vinifera spp., etc.); anthracnose or brown stem rot of Japanese persimmon (Diospyros kaki, etc.); anthracnose, powdery mildew, gummy stem blight or downy mildew of cucurbit (Cucumis melo, etc.); early blight, leaf mold or late blight of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum); various Alternaria disease pathogens of cruciferous vegetables<br>
(Brassica sp., Raphanus sp., etc); late blight or early blight of potato<br>
(Solanum tuberosum); powdery mildew of strawberry (Fragaria, etc.); and gray<br>
 <br>
mold or disease caused by Sclerotinia of various crops; and controlling soil diseases caused by plant pathogens such as Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia, Verticillium and Plasmodiophora.  As the controlling agents against sanitary insect pests, they are effective for controlling insects which carry pathogen to infect human with diseases, such as Culex tritaenitorhynchus, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles, Aedes albopictus, Anopheles sinensis, Aedes togoi, Mansonia, Aedes, Phlebotominae, Agriosphodrus, tsetse fly (Glossina), house mosquito (Culex pipiens), tropical rat mite (Ornithonyssus bacoti), housefly (Musca domestica), cockroaches, Simulium, Chrysops, flea (Siphonaptera), tick (Ixodoidea), Trombiculidae and louse (Anoplura), insects which directly harm human by blood sucking, biting or the like, such as hornet (Vespinae), paper wasp (Polistes) and Lymantriidae; nuisances such as ant (Formicidae), rough woodlouse<br>
(Porcellio scaber), spider (Araneae), pillbugs (Armadilidium vulgare), centipede (Chilopada), millipede (Diplopada) and Thereuonema tuberculate; and domestic mites which causes alergtic diseases, such as mold mite (Tyrophagus putrescentiae), Dormatophagoides farinae and Chelacaropsis moorei.  As the control agents against pests on trees and turf, they are effective for controlling trees pests such as Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, Monochamus alternatus, Lymantria dispar, Monema flavescens, Hyphantria cunea, bagworm<br>
(Psychidae), Ceroplastes, Coccoidea, Stephanitis pyrioides and Dendrolimus spectabilis; and pests against turf such as Scarabaeidae, Spodoptera depravata, Parapediasia teterrella, hunting billbug (Sphenophorus venatus) and Gryllotalpidae.  Further, as the control agents against clothes and household goods insect pests, they are effective for controlling case making clothes moth<br>
(Tinea pellionella), black carpet beetle (Anthrenus scrophularidae) and termite<br>
(Rhinotermitidae).  Among them, the agricultural and horticultural pesticides are particularly effective for controlling plant parasitic mites, agricultural insect pests, plant parasitic nematodes, various diseases or the like.  Further, they are effective against insect pests having acquired resistance to organophosphorus, carbamate and/or synthetic pyrethroid insecticides.  Moreover, the compounds of the formula (I) have excellent systemic properties, and by the<br>
 <br>
application of the compounds of the formula (I) to soil treatment, not only noxious insects, noxious mites, noxious nematodes, noxious gastropods and noxious isopods in soil but also foliage pests can be controlled.<br>
The pesticides against parasites on animals are effective for controlling e.g. external parasites which are parasitic on the body surface of host animals (such as the back, the axilla, the lower abdomen or inside of the thigh) or internal parasites which are parasitic in the body of host animals (such as the stomach, the intestinal tract, the lung, the heart, the liver, the blood vessels, the subcutis or lymphatic tissues), but they are particularly effective for controlling the external parasites.<br>
The external parasites may, for example, be animal parasitic acarina or fleas.  Their species are so many that it is difficult to list all of them, and therefore, their typical examples will be given.<br>
The animal parasitic acarina may, for example, be ticks such as Boophilus microplus, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Haemaphysalis longicornis, Haemaphysalis flava, Haemaphysalis campanulata, Haemaphysalis concinna, Haemaphysalis japonica, Haemaphysalis kitaokai, Haemaphysalis ias, Ixodes ovatus, Ixodes nipponensis, Ixodes persulcatus, Amblyomma testudinarium, Haemaphysalis megaspinosa, Dermacentor reticulatus, and Dermacentor taiwanesis; common red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae); northern fowl mites such as Ornithonyssus sylviarum, and Ornithonyssus bursa; trombidioids such as Eutrombicula wichmanni, Leptotrombidium akamushi, Leptotrombidium pallidum, Leptotrombidium fuji, Leptotrombidium tosa, Neotrombicula autumnalis, Eutrombicula alfreddugesi, and Helenicula miyagawai; cheyletidae such as Cheyletiella yasguri, Cheyletiella parasitivorax, and Cheyletiella blakei; sarcoptic mange mites such as Psoroptes cuniculi, Chorioptes bovis, Otodectes cynotis, Sarcoptes scabiei, and Notoedres cati; and Demodicidae such as Demodex canis.  The pesticides against parasites on animals, are particularly effective for the control of ticks among them.<br>
The fleas may, for example, be externally parasitic wingless insects belonging to Siphonaptera, more specifically, fleas belonging to Pulicidae, Ceratephyllus, etc.  Fleas belonging to Pulicidae may, for example, be<br>
 <br>
Ctenocephalides canis, Ctenocephalides felis, Pulex irritans, Echidnophaga gallinacea, Xenopsylla cheopis, Leptopsylla segnis, Nosopsyllus fasciatus, and Monopsyllus anisus.  The pesticides against parasites on animals, are particularly effective for the control of fleas belonging to Pulicidae, particularly Ctenocephalides canis and Ctenocephalides felis, among them.<br>
Other external parasites may, for example, be sucking lice  (Anoplura)  such as shortnosed cattle louse (Haematopinus eurysternus), horse sucking louse (Haematopinus asini), sheep louse, longnosed cattle louse (Linognathus vituli), and head louse (Pediculus capitis); biting lice such as dog biting louse (Trichodectes canis); and blood-sucking dipterous insects such as horsefly (Tabanus trigonus), biting midges (Culicoides schultzei), and blackfly (Simulium ornatum).  Further, the internal parasites may, for example, be nematodes such as lung worms, whipworms (Trichuris), tuberous worms, gastric parasites, ascaris, and filarioidea; cestoda such as Spirometra erinacei, Diphyllobothrium latum, Dipylidium caninum, Taenia multiceps, Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis; trematoda such as Schistosoma japonicum and Fasciola hepatica; and protozoa such as coccidia, malaria parasites (Plasmodium malariae), intestinal sarcocyst, toxoplasma, and Cryptosporidium.<br>
The host animals may, for example, be pet animals, domestic animals, and poultry, such as dogs, cats, mice, rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, squirrels, rabbits, ferrets, birds (such as pigeons, parrots, hill mynas, Java sparrows, honey parrots, lovebirds and canaries), cows, horses, pigs, sheep, ducks and chickens.  The pesticides against parasites on animals, are particularly effective for the control of pests parasitic on pet animals or domestic animals, especially for the control of external parasites, among them.  Among pet animals or domestic animals, they are effective particularly for dogs, cats, cows and horses.<br>
In the present invention, the weight ratio of the active compounds of at least one compound of the formula (I) or its salt to other pesticide is from 1:100,000 to 100,000:1, preferably from 1:40,000 to 40,000:1, more preferably<br>
 <br>
from 1:40,000 to 100:1.  The pesticidal composition of the present invention is, in the same manner as conventional agricultural chemicals, formulated together with agricultural adjuvants into an emulsifiable concentrate, a dust, granules, a wettable powder, water-dispersible granules, a suspension concentrate, a soluble concentrate, an aerosol, a paste, etc.  That is, the pesticidal composition of the present invention may be formulated by mixing the respective active compounds, or by mixing formulations of the respective active compounds.  The ratio of the agricultural adjuvants is from 1 to 99.999 parts by weight based on from 0.001 to 99 parts by weight of the active compounds, preferably from 5 to 99.99 parts by weight based on from 0.01 to 95 parts by weight, more preferably from 20 to 99.99 parts by weight based on from 0.01 to 80 parts by weight.  In the actual application of such a formulation, it may be used as it is, or may be diluted to a predetermined concentration with a diluent such as water.<br>
As the agricultural adjuvants, there may be mentioned carriers, emulsifiers, suspending agents, dispersants, extenders, penetrating agents, wetting agents, thickeners, defoaming agents, stabilizers or antifreezing agents.  They may be added as the case requires.  The carriers may be classified into solid carriers and liquid carriers.  As the solid carriers, there may be mentioned powders of animal and plant origin, such as starch, activated carbon, soybean flour, wheat flour, wood powder, fish powder or powdered milk; or mineral powders such as talc, kaolin, bentonite, calcium carbonate, zeolite, diatomaceous earth, white carbon, clay or alumina; sulfur powder; anhydrous sodium sulfate; and the like. As the liquid carriers, there may be mentioned water; alcohols such as methyl alcohol or ethylene glycol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone; ethers such as dioxane or tetrahydrofuran; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as kerosine, gas oil or the like; aromatic hydrocarbons such as xylene, trimethylbenzene, tetramethylbenzene, cyclohexane or solvent naphtha; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chloroform or chlorobenzene; acid amides such as dimethylformamide; esters such as ethyl acetate or glycerine ester of a fatty acid; nitriles such as acetonitrile; sulfur-containing<br>
 <br>
compounds such as dimethyl sulfoxide; vegetable oils such as soybean oil or corn oil; and the like.<br>
The pesticidal composition of the present invention is applied in an active ingredient concentration of a compound of the formula (I) or its salt of from 0.001 to 100,000 ppm, preferably from 0.005 to 50,000 ppm, more preferably from 0.005 to 20,000 ppm, and in an active ingredient concentration of other pesticide of from 0.0001 to 100,000 ppm, preferably from 0.0025 to 50,000 ppm, more preferably from 0.0025 to 20,000 ppm.  The active ingredient concentration may optionally be changed depending upon the formulation, the manner, purpose, timing or place of the application and the condition of the insect pests.  For instance, aquatic noxious insects can be controlled by applying a formulation having the above-mentioned concentration to the site of the outbreak, and thus, the concentration of the active ingredient in water is less than the above-mentioned range.<br>
The amount of the application of the active ingredient per unit surface area is usually from about 0.001 to 50,000 g, preferably from 0.005 to 10,000 g, per hectare as an active ingredient of a compound of the formula (I) or its salt, and from about 0.0001 to 50,000, preferably from 0.0025 to 10,000 g, per hectare as an active ingredient of other pesticide.  However, in a certain special case, the amount of the application may be outside the above range. Various formulations containing the compounds of the present invention or their diluted compositions may be applied by conventional methods for application which are commonly employed, such as spraying (e.g. spraying, jetting, misting, atomizing, powder or grain scattering or dispersing in water), soil application (e.g. mixing or drenching), surface application (e.g. coating, powdering or covering) or impregnation to obtain poisonous feed.  Further, it is possible to feed domestic animals with a food containing the above active ingredient and to control the outbreak or growth of pests, particularly insects pests, with their excrements.  Furthermore, the active ingredient may also be applied by a so-called ultra low-volume application method.  In this method, the composition may be composed of 100% of the active ingredient.<br>
 <br>
Further, a compound of the formula (I) or its salt may be mixed with or may be used in combination with other agricultural chemicals, fertilizers or phytotoxicity-reducing agents, whereby synergistic effects or activities may sometimes be obtained.  Such other agricultural chemicals include, for example, a herbicide, an antivirus agent, an attractant, a plant hormone and a plant growth regulating agent.  Especially, with a pesticidal composition having a compound of the formula (I) or its salt mixed with or used in combination with one or more active compounds of other agricultural chemicals, the application range, the application time, the pesticidal activities, etc. may be improved to preferred directions.  Each active compounds may separately be formulated so that they may be mixed for use at the time of application, or they may be formulated together.  The present invention includes such a pesticidal composition.<br>
In addition, the agricultural chemicals which may be mixed with or may be used in combination with the compound of the formula (I) or its salt may, for example, be active compounds of herbicides as disclosed in Farm Chemicals Handbook (2002), particularly soil application type. EXAMPLES<br>

TEST EXAMPLE 1 Test on controlling effects against common cutworm (Spodoptera litura)<br>
A leaf segment of cabbage was dipped for about 10 seconds in an insecticidal solution and dried in air.  A wet filter paper was laid in a petri dish having a diameter of 9 cm, and the dried leaf segment of cabbage was<br>
 <br>
placed thereon.  10 Second-instar larvae of common cutworm were released therein and after putting a cover, left in a constant temperature chamber at 25Â°C with lightening.  On the 5th or 6th day after release, dead larvae were counted, and the mortality was calculated by the following equation.  Here, the insects that were moribund were counted as dead insects.  The test results are shown in Tables 1 to 35.<br>
Mortality (%) = {(number of dead insects)/(number of surviving insects+number of dead insects)}xlOO<br>
Further, the theoretical mortality (%) can be calculated from the colby's formula.  When the mortality (%) is higher than the theoretical mortality (%), the pesticidal composition of the present invention has a synergistic effect regarding controlling of pests.  The theoretical mortality (%) by the colby's formula are shown in brackets in Tables 1 to 35.<br>
