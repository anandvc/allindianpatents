				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel fragrance-imparting compound and more particularly to a compound with a woody or amber odor, having an excellent residual odor property, and a perfume composition containing the same.<br>
Description of the Background:<br>
Perfumes having a residual odor property among perfumes having a woody or amber odor are used as a base note in compounding perfumes and are important materials for determining odors as a frame of compound perfumes.  However, most of these compounds including natural materials are fairly expensive, which places a large restriction on the use of the materials in inexpensive compound perfumes.  Hence, it is quite important to develop inexpensive materials having a woody or amber fragrance and a residual odor property.<br>
It has been reported that ortho- and paraalkylcyclo--hexanols, ortho- and paraalkylcyclohexanones, ortho- and paraalkylcyclohexyl acetates, and the like, which are derived from alkylphenols and are represented by the following formulas,<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The inventors have directed research effort and investigation into compounds which exhibit a woody or amber odor, which have an excellent residual odor property and which can be prepared at a low price.  It has been found that cyclohexanes obtained by the hydrogenation of epoxide addition products of alkylcyclohexanols or alkylphenols satisfy such requirements.  In formula (1) above, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl and the like are examples of alkyl groups for R6, R7 and R8.<br>

The present compounds of formula (1) can be prepared, for example, by any of the following reaction schemes.<br>
(A)  In the following scheme, alkylcyclohexanol (2) is treated in the presence of a strong base to make an alcoholate, and then the alcoholate is reacted with an epoxide (3) to prepare the product compound of formula (1).<br><br>

The preferred amount of the epoxide (3) used in the above reaction is in a range of a 1.0 to 5.0 equivalent per equivalent of alkylcyclohexanol (2), and a 1.0 to 1.2 equivalent amount in particular is preferred.  Both the alcoholate forming reaction and the epoxide addition reaction are carried out at a temperature of 30 to 120°C, preferably at 50 to 100°C.<br>
In this case, when alkylcyclohexanol (2), as a raw material, is a mixture of cis-trans isomers, the compound (1) obtained is also a mixture of cis-trans isomers.  The mixture of the isomers may be separated by, for example, column chromatography or the like, or can it be used as it is.<br>
(B)  In another embodiment, alkylphenol (4) is reacted with the epoxide (3) in the presence of a base catalyst to form α  - (alkylphenyleneoxy) -ß-alkanol (5), and the obtained compound (5) is hydrogenated in the presence of a metal catalyst to prepare present compound (1).<br><br>

** Compound is applied to odor paper and the number of days the odor persists is measured.<br>
As described above, the present compounds of formula (1) can be produced by using inexpensive materials and the present<br><br>
compounds having a woody or amber odor possess an excellent residual odor property.  Hence, by blending the present compound (1) , as a base note, with other odorants, an excellent perfume composition can be obtained.  The amount of the present compound  (1), blended into the likes of perfume compositions, varies depending on other compounded perfume ingredients, destination odors, and the like and is not limited provided that a woody or amber fragrance can be imparted.  Further, the perfume compositions of the present invention can be widely used as a fragrance imparting component for perfumes, soaps, shampoos, rinses, detergents, cosmetics, fragrance imparting agents, and so forth either independently or in combination with other perfume compositions.<br>
Having now generally described this invention, a further understanding can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples which are provided herein for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified.<br>
