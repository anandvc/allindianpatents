FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to production of Carbon-Manganese strap steel with high strength<br>
and ductility. In particular, the invention is directed to an improved quality strap steel through<br>
development of suitable microstructure. Advantageously, the invention is directed to achieving<br>
much desired maximum strength-ductility combination, which would further enable reducing the<br>
width of the strap without compromising on strength. This would further favour saving of<br>
material and cost of strap steel. In particular the invention would favour obtaining a grade of<br>
steel in the form of narrow strap, usually 1.27 mm thick and 31.75 mm wide having high<br>
strength (UTS) in the range from 1040 MPa to 1100 MPa coupled with a ductility value (%<br>
elongation) in the range of 8-10%(150mm gauge length), such as to withstand the nature of<br>
load they are expected to experience during transportation being used as a packing material for<br>
steel coils or bundle of sheets.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
Strap steel of 1.27 mm thickness is produced in some steel plants for packaging of steel coils<br>
and sheets. Such steel straps are produced for use as a packing material for binding the fully<br>
processed coils and packets of sheets after they are covered with HDPE cloth and galvanized<br>
sheet. Additionally, a number of coils are utilized together with the help of 1.27mm strap in the<br>
railway wagons for the supply of the coils to the customers at distant locations from the steel<br>
plants. Hence, such straps need to have high strength as binding/packing of material for steel<br>
coils/sheets of heavy weight, to withstand the load including sudden jerks, during transportation<br>
and also should be reasonably ductile so that it is easily bent without failure during its<br>
use/application as packing material.<br>
US 6814817 states about a heat treated steel strap usable in a strapping machine, having<br>
a tensile strength of at least about 170 KSI and an elongation of at least about 6.5%. the<br>
steel strap is fabricated from a coiled steel reduced by cold rolling, the steel strap<br>
composition comprising 0.3-0.36% Carbon, 0.90-1.25% Manganese, and 0.75-1.10%<br>
Silicon; the strap being heated to a temperature of about 850°C to about 900°C; and<br>
quenched to a temperature of about 370°C to about 510°C, the strap having a seal joint<br>
break strength of about 4350 pounds when the strap has a width of about one inch and a<br>
thickness of 0.03 inch.Preferably, the strap is preheated to a temperature of about 370°C to<br>
about 540°C prior to heating, heated and subsequently quenched. This prior art further<br>
states that that the addition of silicon in an amount of about 0.75 to about 1.10 percent by<br>
weight of the material tends to reduce the embrittlement that the material would otherwise<br>
exhibit. Thus this US prior art makes use of selective weight percent of Silicon to reduce<br>
embrittlement and have attained a ductility of 6.5%.<br>
In our co-pending patent application no. 708 CAL/2001 dated 24-12-2001, there is disclosed a<br>
process for producing steel strap involving austempering after casting and rolling to achieve<br>
improved strength properties. However, there has been a continuous need in the art to provide<br>
for possible further improvement in quality of strap steel by achieving suitable microstructure,<br>
which would favour increase in strength without loss of ductility (% elongation). The present<br>
invention is thus specifically directed to providing the C-Mn steel strap with enhanced strength-<br>
ductility properties achieved through selective microstructure of the grade of steel obtained<br>
through selective use of changed process parameters.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thus the basic object of the invention is directed to providing the C-Mn steel strap with<br>
enhanced properties achieved through selective microstructure of the grade of steel which<br>
would on one hand achieve increased strength characteristics and on the other hand also<br>
favours maintaining desired ductility (% elongation).<br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to obtaining a grade of carbon-<br>
manganese steel strap having high strength and reasonable ductility/percent elongation<br>
such as to ensure the use of this steel strap as reliable packaging materials without failure<br>
for steel coils and bundles of steel sheets for transportation to distant places from the<br>
manufacturing plants, by rail/road transport.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to obtain said high strength and ductility in steel<br>
strap for packaging, usually in the size of 1.27mm thick and 31.75mm wide.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to obtain said high strength and ductility in steel<br>
strap for packaging wherein the improved strength and ductility properties are achieved<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE ACCOMPANYING<br>
FIGURES:<br>
To obtain the combination of improved high strength and ductility properties in the<br>
particular grade of steel used for producing the strap for packaging according to the present<br>
invention, a number of laboratory trials were conducted to study, observe and record the<br>
influence of alloying elements like C, Mn and Si on the hardenability of the resulting steel.<br>
Different corresponding microstrutures of steel grades were obtained. The 100% bainitic<br>
micro-structure with non-lamellar carbides resulted in the maximum strength-ductility<br>
combination. Such microstructure was achieved during carrying out experimental trial<br>
production of this product after austempering stage.<br>
According to the present invention the alloy chemistry on Wt. % basis of the steel obtained<br>
after melting in the basic oxygen furnaceand subsequent treatment in secondary refining<br>
unit(SRU) for Sulphur control, as starting material was as follows:<br><br>
C in the range of 0.40 to 0.45, Mn in the range of 1.6 to 1.65, P in the range of 0.025(max),<br>
S in the range of 0.015(max), Si in the range of 0.45 to 0.50, Al in the range of 0.025 to<br>
0.040.<br>
This grade of steel was further processed through continuous casting. The slabs were cast<br>
maintaining the superheat of 30°C max. and at a casting speed of about 1m/min. The slabs<br>
were soaked at 1250°C and hot rolled to 2.8mm strips, maintaining finishing and coiling<br>
temperature 880±10°C and 690±10°C respectively. Hot rolled strips were pickled in<br>
Hydrochloric acid (HCL) media before cold rolling to further reduction in thickness to<br>
1.27mm thick sheet wound in coils. Cold rolled coils were slit in 31.75mm width straps and<br>
subsequently austempered.<br>
Attention is first invited to Figure 1 that shows the schematic diagram of the austempering<br>
unit, according to the present invention. The steel strap is passed with the help of an<br>
uncoiler through a austenitising furnace maintained at 930-950°C at its different zones<br>
where it gets austenitised over duration of about 2 min. Subsequently, it passes through a<br>
lead bath at 1.2 meter distance and the temperature of said bath is maintained at 430-<br>
460°C. After completion of bainitic transformation while passed through the lead bath, with<br>
residence time for about 1/2 min, the strap passes through the cooling tower and finally<br>
coiled as finished product.<br>
The optical and SEM micrograph of the corresponding processed grade of strap material are<br>
shown in the accompanying figures 2(a) and 2(b) respectively. The micrograph of the<br>
steel strap according to the present invention shows that a 100% bainitic structure and the<br>
carbide in the bainite is non-lamellar which is the characteristic of bainitic<br>
transformation.The resulting steel garde was further tested for tensile strength and percent<br>
elongation carried out in the shop itself using WNC Tensile Testing Machine. The test results<br>
achieved	are	UTS:	1040-1100	MPa	and	%<br>
elongation 8-10 (150 mm gauge length) which are substantially higher than<br>
those specified in IRS: M-41 specification. Such microstructure is responsible for a high<br>
level of strength such as UTS in the range of 1040 MPa to 1100 MPa, without any sacrifice in<br>
the ductility, which is maintained in the range of 8-10% to favour the use of the steel strap<br>
for bending during packaging without failure. The flow chart for the entire process and its<br>
sequences to produce the C-Mn steel strap having high strength-ductility combination<br>
properties, according to the present invention is illustrated in the accompanying Figure 3.<br>
Because of very high strength of the product, the width of the strap are capable to be<br>
reduced further from the existing 31.75mm in order to effect material saving.<br><br>
