This invention relates to a device for feeding internally 1DC atable machine components and the 1ike to a specified point, such as, an assembly line.<br>
Components, such as those used as parts of, or fitting  for, machines, apparatuses, appliances or equipment are required to be fed to the point where they are further processed e.g. to the point where they are picked up by a robot and placed on a conveyor for being sent to the assembly line.<br>
Feeding mechanisms are known to the art, but these are applicable to cases where the components are   locatable, as for instance, where the components are stacked in a cylinder and fed therefrom.<br>
However, when feeding has to be done with components which are internally locatable, particularly, when such components also require to be fed in a predetermined, oriented manner, problems are encountered in achieving such objectives in practice,<br>
Firstly, a rod must be provided for being passed through th» internal ly locatable e components to have the/n stacked on such rod, but then the movement of the components on the rod to the point of feeding   not be possible because the rod will necessarily have to be provided with some support and such support will defeat the very purpose sought to be fulfilled, since it will impede the movement of the components along  the<br><br>
rod. Secondly, the further requirement in such cases is that the rod must be free at both ends for the components to be freely stacked and fed,<br>
This invention, therefore, proposes a device which overcomes the above mentioned problems. It also enables internally locatable components to be stacked and fed in appreciated orientations.<br>
Various other features of this invention will be apparent from the following further description thereof.<br>
The device for feeding internally locatable machine components and the like to a specified point, according to   invention, comprises a rod on which the said components are internally locatable; a slidably table, the top surface of which is provided with a slot disposed below the bottom end of the rod, the slot accommodating a component locator, the distance between the bottom end of the rod and the base of the slot being greater than the thickness of a component, while the distance between the said surface and the bottom end of the rod is 1 ess than the said thickness, thereby leaving a gap, of width 1 ess than the said thickness, between the said surface and the bottom end of the red at least two jaws, namely, first and second jaws, for alternately gripping and releasing the rod, at two spaced  points thereon, for  enabling<br><br>
said  components  to  be internally located on  the  rod,  and<br>
thereafter,  fed  singly, into the slot, to  engage  with  the<br>
locator  therein,  the  table  then  sliding  away,  with  the<br>
component,  to  a  pick  up point,  before  returning  to  its<br>
original  posit ion  to  repeat the  operation}  at  least  two<br>
sensors for B1lowing only a predetermined number of components<br>
to enter the buffer zone (between the first jaw and the second<br>
jaw),  and  the feeding zone (between the second jaw  and  the<br>
bottom  of the rod)   and a  microprocessor  based<br>
system connected to the circuit of the jaws, th« table and the<br>
sensors for controlling the operation thereof.<br>
This  invention will now be described in further  detai1  with<br>
reference  to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate,  by<br>
way  of  example one of various possible embodiments  of  this<br>
invention, wherein<br>
Fig 1 illustrates the rod and jaw assembly<br>
Fig 2 illustratee the arrestor plug<br>
Fig 3 i1lustrates the arrestor socket<br>
Fig 4 illustrates a spec imen of one of possible components<br>
and<br>
Fig  5  illustrates the circuit layout of  the  microprocessor<br>
system.<br>
The  embodiment  will be seen to comprise the rod R  on  which<br>
components, such as the spec imen D, i1 lustrated in Fig 4,  are<br><br>
internally locatable, with the rod R psalm through the bore C Df the components D. The components D, thus   located on the rod R, are depicted in Fig 1 in broken outline. The top surface S of a slidable table T is provided with a slot E disposed below the bottom end G of the rod R. The »lot E accommodates a component locator H. The distance between the bottom end 0 of the rod and the base K of the slot Is greater than the thickness L of a component D, while the distance between the said surface B and the bottom end 0 of the rod is less than the said thickness L, thereby leaving a gap, of width less than the said thickness, between the said surface S and the bottom end S of the rod. This ensures that as each component leaves the bottom end 6 of the rod R and enters the slot E, to engage with the locator H, the net component in line on the rod does not slip off the rod, but will have to wait its turn to ^et into the slot E. Two jaws  (driven by actuators Al and ft2&gt; serve to support the rod R such that its top and bottom ends F and S are both free and out of contact we th any other abject. These jaws alternately grip and release the rod, at two spaced points M and N thereon. From the top of the rod F to the point M, where the jaw Jl  Is<br><br>
located, is called the loading zone. From the point M, where the jaw Ji is located, to the point N, where jaw J2 is located, is called the buffer zone. From the point N, where jaw 32 is located, to the bottom end of the rod B, is called the feeding zone.<br>
Sensor SI senses the number of components in the buffer zone. Sensor 82 senses the number of components in the feeding zone. Components are manually loaded on to the rod from the top and come to rest on jaw Jl or travel down into the buffer zone depending an whether jaw Jl its closed or open. When sensor S2 senses that the number of components in the feeding zone has fallen below a certain value, jaw S2 is opened to allow the components in the buffer zone to pass down the rod R into the feeding zone. At this time, the jaw Jl will be clOKed. When the sensor SI senses that the number of components in the buffer zone is leas than a predetermined number the jaw Jl   opened. Jaw J2 will remain closed at that time. When the number of components in the buffer zone is sensed by the sensor SI as equal to or exceeding a predetermined number, the Jaw Jl is closed.<br>
   no point is the jaw  r J2 open simultaneously, so  much so that the rod R is gripped by either jaw Jl or J2 or  both. In  the feeding zone, the bottommost component <at the bottom end of rod r falls into slot e to engage with></at><br>
locator H. At this stage the slidable table T move the component away to a place where, for instance, a pick and place robot takes it away -for further operations. The table T now moves back to its original position.<br>
As the slidable table T moves a component away, as described above, the next component in line on the rod R, in the feeding zone, is unable to slip off the rod R, because the distance between the top surface B of the table T and the bottom end G of the rod is less than the thickness L of a component, however, when the table moves back to its original position, with the slot E once again disposed below the bottom end o-f the rod R, the next component in line slips off the rod to land in the slot, engage with the locator H and be moved «w«y by the table T to repeat the operation.<br>
In cases where the components need to be oriented   being fed and moved away, orientation means will be provided for the rod R to mate with co-operating orientation mean* on each component. By way of example, the component D in the drawings is shown to have a depression, such as, a channel Y cut in it. Mating with this channel is a protuberance, such as, a fluting Z provided on the rod R. The locator H will also be provided with a similar fluting. Thus from the stage of locating, stacking, feeding and being moved away by the table T, the<br><br>
component D will be in its predetermined, oriented position. The  actuators  of  the jaws Jl  J2, sensors  SI  32  and  the movement  of  the  table T are controlled and  operated  by  a microprocessor  based system, the circuit layout of  which  is illustrated in Fig 5,<br>
In order to arrest any rotational movement of the rod R, arrestors are provided, such as, s plus V provided on each jaw assembly and a mating socket W on the rod R <fi9s. and every time a jaw closes the corresponding plug mates with its socket to arrest any rotational movement of rod r. opens disengage allow free passage components down other is closed r continues be rotationally arrested.></fi9s.>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, th»re being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any equivalents of the features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of the device proposed herein are possible without departing from the scope end ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
