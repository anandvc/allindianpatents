				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Floor covering.<br>
The present invention concerns a floor covering, in<br>
particular of the type consisting of hard panels.<br>
In a particular, yet not restrictive manner, it concerns a<br>
floor covering formed of laminate panels, also called<br>
laminate parquet.<br>
It is known that such laminate panels can be made of<br>
different layers. Usually, the panels are formed of boards<br>
on the basis of wood, such as chipboard or fibreboard, in<br>
particular MDF or HDF, upon which one or several layers,<br>
including a decorative layer, are provided at least on the<br>
top side. The decorative layer may be a printed paper<br>
layer, but in certain embodiments it may just as well be a<br>
layer of wood, in particular veneer. Such panels can also<br>
be made of other materials, for example merely synthetic<br>
material, or of a base plate on the basis of wood, such as<br>
chipboard, MDF or HDF and the like, upon which is provided,<br>
instead of a printed paper layer or veneer, another<br>
material such as cork, thin strips of wood and the like.<br>
It is also known to couple these panels on their edges as<br>
they are laid, either by means of a conventional tongue and<br>
groove joint, whereby they are possibly glued together,<br>
either by means of a glueless coupling which provides for a<br>
mutual interlocking of the panels both in the horizontal<br><br>
and vertical direction, for example as described in<br>
international patent No. WO 97/47934.<br>
The present invention aims a floor covering of hard panels,<br>
in particular laminate panels, which provides for new<br>
embodiments according to different aspects offering<br>
respective advantages.<br>
According to a first aspect, the invention provides for a<br>
floor covering consisting of hard panels, whereby these<br>
panels are provided, at least on two opposite edges, with<br>
coupling means made in one piece with the panels, so that<br>
several of such panels can be mutually coupled, whereby<br>
these coupling means provide for an interlocking in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the plane of the floor covering,<br>
as well as in a direction perpendicular to the edges<br>
concerned and parallel to the plane of the floor covering,<br>
and whereby these coupling means are made such that the<br>
panels can be rotated into and/or out of one another at<br>
ieast along the above-mentioned edges, characterised in<br>
that the panels are provided, at leastion the above-<br>
mentioned edges, near the top side, with a part from which<br>
has been removed an amount of material.<br>
As material parts have been removed from the top edge, this<br>
offers several advantages. A first advantage consists in<br>
that the panels, as they are rotated, both when rotating<br>
into one another and when rotating out of one another, can<br>
be moved more easily in relation to one another, as there<br>
are no angular parts anynore which hinder the mutual<br>
rotation of the panels. A second advantage consists in<br><br>
that the panels can be made heavier, in particular thicker<br>
than as usual, as the thickness of the panels, thanks to -<br>
the bevel, has little or no influence anymore on the good<br>
working order of the above-mentioned coupling means, during<br>
the rotating in and/or the rotating out.<br>
Preferably, the above-mentioned parts consist of bevels, in<br>
particular with a gradient of 45°. Practically, the bevels<br>
preferably extend, in a horizontal direction, over a<br>
distance of at least 1 millimetre. Preferably, however,<br>
this distance is in the order of magnitude of 2 millimetre.<br>
According to a different variant of the first aspect of the<br>
invention, the coupling means are made such that the<br>
panels, instead of being disconnectable at least by a<br>
rotation, can be disconnected from one another at least in<br>
one other manner. Even then, the above-mentioned bevel<br>
still offers certain advantages, as will become clear from<br>
the further description.<br>
According to the most preferred embodiment, the panels are<br>
rectangular and are provided with the above-mentioned<br>
parts, the above-mentioned bevels respectively, or. all four<br>
sides.<br>
According to a second aspect which can either or not be<br>
combined with the first aspect, the invention provides for<br>
a floor covering consisting of hard panels with a core upon<br>
which is provided a decorative layer, whereby these panels<br>
are rectangular and elongated and are provided with<br>
coupling means at least on the two opposite longitudinal<br><br>
edges, so that several of such panels can be mutually<br>
coupled to one another, whereby these coupling means<br>
provide for an interlocking in a direction perpendicular to<br>
the plane of the floor covering, as well as in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the edges concerned and parallel to the<br>
plane of the floor covering, and whereby these coupling<br>
means are made such that the panels can be coupled and/or<br>
uncoupled by means of a rotation along their longitudinal<br>
edge, characterised in that the width of the panels is<br>
smaller than 17 cm, and preferably even smaller than 16 cm.<br>
Further, these panels, apart from the above-mentioned<br>
maximum width, preferably have a length which amounts to at<br>
least eight times the width.<br>
It is known that hard panels, which are equipped with<br>
coupling means which provide for a horizontal and a<br>
vertical interlocking on at least two of their edges, are<br>
made as relatively small plates with a width of 19 to 20 cm<br>
and a length of 1.20 to 1.40 m. It is also known that the<br>
plates, when being laid, have to be occasionally rotated<br>
into one another and out of one another so as to make them<br>
fit against a wall, skirting board cr the like. A<br>
disadvantage of the known embodiments cf the above-<br>
mentioned plates consists in that it is often difficult to<br>
carry out said rotation, for example when the plates have<br>
to be installed with their far ends under the edge of an<br>
overhanging cupboard cr such. According to the above-<br>
mentioned second aspect of the invention, this<br>
disadvantage, as well as others, are excluded, if not<br>
minimised. Thanks to the small width, the panels are less<br><br>
high when being rotated, so that there are no disadvantages<br>
during the installation in a large number of practical<br>
applications.<br>
Moreover, the above-mentioned relation between length and<br>
width offers a technical solution, as a result of which the<br>
visual 'plate-like' effect is excluded.<br>
According to a third aspect of the invention, it provides<br>
for a floor covering consisting of hard panels, with a<br>
laminated structure, having a decorative layer on the top<br>
surface, characterised in that bevels or such are formed on<br>
one or several edges of the panels, near the top side, and<br>
in that the surface of these bevels or such is also<br>
provided with a decorative layer, preferably a layer<br>
provided as separate. In particular, such a layer<br>
preferably consists of a separately provided print. Thanks<br>
to the use of such a separate print, the bevels can be<br>
easily provided with a decorative surfaced The base panels<br>
can then be realised in a conventional manner by sawing<br>
them out of a large plate which has already been provided<br>
with a decorative layer, whereas the bevels are printed<br>
later.<br>
According to a major embodiment of the third aspect, the<br>
above-mentioned print consists of a print which is obtained<br>
by means of transfer printing. Such transfer printing<br>
offers the advantage, in combination with its use on floor<br>
panels, that high production rates can be obtained and that<br>
any pattern whatsoever can be realised. Further, this<br>
technique excludes the risk of the decorative top surface<br><br>
of the panels being soiled. Another major advantage hereby<br>
consists in that the print is immediately or almost<br>
immediately dry, so that the panels can be stacked and<br>
packed almost immediately.<br>
Preferably, the floor panels, which are made according to<br>
the third aspect of the invention, have a core made of a<br>
material on the basis of wood, in particular wood which has<br>
been ground into particles or fibres, mixed with a binding<br>
agent, upon which the decorative layer is provided, and<br>
whereby the above-mentioned bevels extend through rhe<br>
material of the core. Thus is obtained a porous surface on<br>
the bevels, guaranteeing a good bond of the print.<br>
As usual, the decorative layer preferably contains a layer<br>
printed with a pattern, such as a wood pattern, and the<br>
decorative layer according to the invention, in particular<br>
the print on the bevels or such, is preferably realised<br>
with a similar pattern.<br>
Moreover, use is preferably made of a moisture-proof,<br>
impermeable decorative layer or print respectively, which<br>
is particularly advantageous in case the panels have a base<br>
plate which consists of porous material, such as MDF, HDF<br>
or the like. Thus is obtained an entirely moisture-proof<br>
structure on the top surface, on the flat surface by means<br>
of the usual layer of synthetic material on the one hand,<br>
and on the bevels by means of the additional decorative<br>
layer situated on the bevel on the other hand.<br><br>
Although the decorative layer on the bevels is preferably<br>
realised by means of transfer printing, other possibilities<br>
are not excluded. Thus, for example, use can be made of a<br>
self-adhesive strip.<br>
According to a fourth aspect, the invention provides for a<br>
floor covering, consisting of hard panels with a core on<br>
the basis of MDF or HDF, or a similar material,<br>
characterised in that the panels are each separately<br>
provided with an underlayer provided on the bottom side and<br>
fixed onto it, preferably made of polyethylene or on the<br>
basis of polyethylene. The combination of MDF or HDF with<br>
the use of an underlayer fixed onto it, especially when it<br>
is formed of polyethylene or is made on the basis of<br>
polyethylene, offers the advantage that particularly good<br>
sound-insulating qualities are obtained.<br>
The present invention concerns embodiments applying only<br>
one of the above-mentioned aspects as well as embodiments<br>
in which two or several of the above-mentioned aspects are<br>
combined. In this respect it should be noted that two or<br>
several of the above-mentioned embodiments can be mutually<br>
combined at random, in any possible combination, provided<br>
these embodiments have no contradictory qualities.<br>
Although, according to scrie of the above-mentioned aspects,<br>
the panels may consist of different sorts of material, the<br>
invention is particularly suitable for panels mase of MDF<br>
or HDF, or a similar material.<br><br>
According to a special embodiment, the panels have a<br>
thickness of 9 mm at the least, and better still of 10 mm<br>
at the least, as opposed to the usual thickness of 7 or 8<br>
mm.<br>
Thus are obtained relatively heavy panels, which<br>
consequently have a better sound-insulating effect, as a<br>
result of which less sound is produced when they are walked<br>
on.<br>
In so far as coupling means as mentioned above are used<br>
which allow for a glueless interlocking, they can be of<br>
different nature. Thus, these coupling means can show one<br>
of the following characteristics or a combination of two or<br>
several of them:<br>
that they are provided on two opposite edges of the<br>
panels;<br>
- that they are provided on panels which are rectangular,<br>
whereby they are provided on both pairs of opposite<br>
edges;<br>
that at least for a number of the edges they allow for<br>
an assembly according to one of the following<br>
possibilities:<br>
at least by shifting the panels towards one another;<br>
- exclusively by shifting the panels towards one<br>
another;<br>
- at least by rotating the panels along the edges<br>
concerned;<br>
exclusively by rotating the panels along the edges<br>
concerned;<br><br>
by shifting the panels towards one another or by<br>
rotating them, as desired;<br>
that, at least for a number of the edges, they allow for<br>
an uncoupling according to any of the following<br>
possibilities:<br>
at least by shifting the panels out of one another in<br>
a direction perpendicular to the edges;<br>
- exclusively by shifting the panels out of one another<br>
in a direction perpendicular to the edges;<br>
. - at least by rotating the panels along the edges<br>
concerned;<br>
- exclusively by rotating the panels along the edges<br>
concerned;<br>
by shifting the panels out of one another as well as<br>
by rotating them;<br>
- that they are of the type which consists of a tongue and<br>
a groove on the one hand, and of locking means which<br>
ensure at least a specific interlocking in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the edges of the coupled panels and<br>
parallel to the plane of the panels on the other hand;<br>
- that they are realised as in the preceding paragraph,<br>
whereby the lip which limits the bottom side of the<br>
groove, seen from a cross section, extends past the<br>
upper lip, and whereby the locking means consist of one<br>
or several parts on the lip limiting the bottom side of<br>
the groove on the one hand, and of one or several parts<br>
on the bottom side of the tongue working in conjunction<br>
with the latter on the other hand;<br>
that the above-mentioned tongue and groove are made such<br>
that when two of such panels are freely shifted towards<br><br>
one another, over a base or such, the tongue<br>
automatically ends up in the groove;<br>
that they are formed such that the panels, when coupled,<br>
fit into one another without any play or almost without<br>
any play.<br>
Naturally, the invention also concerns panels with which<br>
the above-described floor coverings can be realised.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
invention, the following preferred embodiments are<br>

As represented in figures 1 and 2, the invention concerns a<br>
floor covering 1 as well as hard panels 2 from which such a<br>
floor covering 1 is built up.<br>
According to a first aspect of the invention, a floor<br>
covering 1 is concerned, consisting of hard panels 2,<br>
whereby these panels 2 are provided at least on two<br>
opposite edges 3-4, and preferably, as represented in the<br>
figures 2 to 8, on both pairs of edges 3-4, 5-6<br>
respectively, with coupling means 7 made in one piece out<br>
of the material of the panels 2, so that several of such<br>
panels 2 can be mutually coupled to one another, whereby<br>
these coupling means 7 provide for an interlocking in a<br>
direction R1 perpendicular to the plane of the floor<br>
covering 1, as well as in a direction R2 perpendicular to<br>
the edges 3-4 or 5-6 concerned and parallel to the plane of<br>
the floor covering 1, and whereby these coupling means 7<br>
are made such that the panels 2 can be assembled and/or<br>
disassembled at least along the above-mentioned edges 3-4,<br>
5-6 respectively, by means of a rotation.<br><br>
Such coupling means 7, which make it possible to couple the.<br>
panels 2 without any glue being required, at least on two<br>
sides and preferably on all sides, and whereby the panels 2<br>
are uncoupled by rotating them out of one another, are<br>
known as such from international patent No. 97/47834.<br>
From WO 97/47834 it is also known that the above-mentioned<br>
coupling means 7, as represented in figures 3 to 8 of the<br>
present application, may consist of a tongue 8 and a groove<br>
9 on the one hand, and of locking means 10 on the other<br>
hand which at least ensure a specific interlocking in a<br>
direction perpendicular to the edges 3-4, 5-6 respectively,<br>
of the coupled panels 2 and parallel to the plane of these<br>
panels 2. As is further represented, these coupling means<br>
7 are moreover preferably made such that the lip 11 which<br>
limits the bottom side of the groove 9, seen from a cross<br>
section, extends past the upper lip 12, while the locking<br>
means 10 are formed of interlocking parts 13-14 working in<br>
conjunction, on the above-mentioned lip 11 which limits the<br>
bottom side of the groove 9 and on the bottom side of the<br>
coupled panel 2 respectively, in particular the bottom side<br>
of the tongue 8 or the extension of this bottom side.<br>
As explained in WO 97/47834, such coupling means 7,<br>
depending on their embodiment, allow for different<br>
couplings. According to the most preferred embodiment,<br>
they are, as will be described hereafter by means of figure<br>
1, made such that they allow for a coupling by rotating<br>
into one another as well as by shifting towards one<br>
another. The latter allows such panels to be coupled by<br>
first rotating them into one another on their edges 3-4, as<br><br>
represented by the panel 2A in figure 1, with a rotation<br>
W1, and by subsequently snapping them together on their<br>
edges 5-6 by means of a translation T1. According to a<br>
variant, the connection on the edges 3-4 of the panels<br>
concerned can also be realised by starting from a position<br>
as is schematically indicated with reference 2B, and by<br>
coupling the panel concerned by means of a translation T2.<br>
The above-mentioned rotation is further illustrated in<br>
figures 6 and 7, whereas the sliding motion is represented<br>
in figure 8. Hereby should be noted that the tongue 8 and<br>
groove 9 are preferably made such that, as is also<br>
represented in figure 8, when two such panels 2 are freely<br>
shifted cowards one another over a bottom or such, the<br>
tongue 6 automatically ends up in the groove 9.<br>
It is also possible, while holding a panel 2A in a rotated<br>
position, to couple a following panel 2C onto it on the<br>
edges 5 and 6 concerned, either by means of a translation<br>
T3, or by a mutual rotation between the panels 2A and 2C,<br>
after which both panels 2A and 2C are then rotated down to<br>
be interlocked with the preceding row of panels.<br>
Another advantage consists in that a glueless coupling<br>
without any play or practically without any play remains<br>
possible, also with thicker panels which can be rotated<br>
into and/on out of one another, without any extreme<br>
compressicn forces being created on the edge parts during<br>
the rotation. The bevels makes sure that such forces are<br>
excluded and/or remain limited, so that the risk of<br><br>
damages, among others to the top layer or to the surface of<br>
the bevels, are excluded, if not restricted.<br>
What makes the first aspect of the invention special is<br>
that the above-mentioned panels 2 are provided, at least on<br>
two of their edges 3-4 or 5-6, and preferably on all four<br>
edges 3 to 6, near the top side, with a part from which an<br>
amount of material has been removed, which part preferably<br>
each time consists of a bevel 15.<br>
As represented in figures 6 and 7, these bevels 15 among<br>
others offer the advantage that the panels 2 can be easily<br>
rotated in relation to one another, as the material parts<br>
16 and 17 which are otherwise present no longer press onto<br>
one another, and a contact zone 18 is obtained which is<br>
situated relatively low.<br>
Another advantage consists in that when it is required for<br>
the above-mentioned interlocking parts 13 and 14, in<br>
particular the accompanying contact surfaces 19 and 20, to<br>
extend tangentially or almost tangentially around a circle<br>
having the contact zone 18 as its centre, the average<br>
gradient A of the contact surfaces can be kept relatively<br>
large for a same distance E of the protruding part of the<br>
lower lip 11, as indicated in figure 5, as a result of<br>
which a solid interlocking can be ensured, even with<br>
thicker panels 2.<br>
Another advantage consists in that, irrespective of the<br>
thickness D of the panels 2, the contact zone 18 can always<br>
be situated at a certain height H above the bottom side of<br><br>
the panels 2, provided the bevels 15 are realised over an<br>
appropriate height H1. Thus it is possible, if required,<br>
to always work with similar cutting tools to form the<br>
tongue 8 and groove 9, for thinner as well as for thicker<br>
panels 2.<br>
Although the above-mentioned advantages are particularly<br>
felt with embodiments of the type whereby the uncoupling of<br>
the panels 2 can be realised by means of a rotation around<br>
the above-mentioned contact zone 18, it should be noted<br>
that the above-mentioned bevels 15 also offer advantages<br>
which do not necessarily coincide with the fact whether it<br>
is either or not possible for the panels 2 to be<br>
disassembled by means of rotation. Such bevels 15 offer the<br>
advantage that the panels 2 never press directly onto one<br>
another on their top surface, so that damage of the top<br>
layer resulting from mutual contact between the panels 2 is<br>
excluded, which is particularly important in the case of<br>
laminate parquet, as well as for floor coverings which are<br>
connected without any glue and whereby the panels are<br>
driven into one another by means of a hammer and a stop<br>
block.<br>
Also, according to a different embodiment, the first aspect<br>
of the invention no longer merely applies to panels 2 which<br>
can be disassembled by means of a rotation, but it also<br>
applies to all sorts of panels 2 which are provided with<br>
coupling means 7 which make it possible for the panels 2 to<br>
be interlocked both vertically and horizontally on their<br>
edges 3-4, 5-6 respectively, irrespective of whether the<br><br>
assembly and/or disassembly has to be or can be realised by<br>
means of a rotation or sliding motion.<br>
The above-mentioned bevels 15 preferably extend at an angle<br>
X of 45° in relation to the plane which is determined by<br>
the paneis 2. However, other gradients are not excluded.<br>
Practically, the bevels 15 will extend in a horizontal<br>
direction over a distance Z in the order of magnitude of 2<br>
millimetre, although other dimensions are not excluded here<br>
either.<br>
As is further represented in figure 5, lateral surfaces, in<br>
particular contact surfaces 21-22 are present under the<br>
above-mentioned bevels 15, which fit up to one another at<br>
least at the top when the panels 2 are coupled, and thus<br>
form a mutual stop.<br>
It is clear that the first aspect of the invention can be<br>
applied with panels 2 having an elongated design, as<br>
represented in figure 2, as well as with panels 2 having a<br>
square design.<br>
According to the above-mentioned second aspect of the<br>
invention, which in the given example of figures 1 and 2 is<br>
combined with the above-mentioned first aspect, but which<br>
can also be realised as separate from the first aspect, the<br>
invention concerns a floor covering 1, consisting of hard<br>
paneis 2 having a core 23 and a decorative upper surface<br>
24, whereby these panels 2 are rectangular and elongated<br>
and are provided with coupling means 7 on at least two<br><br>
opposite longitudinal edges 3-4 and/or 5-6, as a result of<br>
which several of such panels 2 can be mutually coupled to<br>
one another, whereby these coupling means 7 are provided<br>
with an interlocking in a direction perpendicular to the<br>
plane of the floor covering 1, as well as in a direction<br>
perpendicular to the edges 3-4-5-6 concerned and parallel<br>
to the plane of the floor covering/ and whereby these<br>
coupling means 7 are made such that the panels 2 can be<br>
coupled and/or uncoupled by means of a rotation along their<br>
longitudinal edges 3-4 and/or 5-6, characterised in that<br>
the useful width B of the panels 2 is smaller than 17 cm,<br>
and preferably amounts to 15.5 cm.<br>
Such a narrow width B, combined with coupling means 7 of<br>
the type whereby the uncoupling has to be carried out by<br>
rotating the panels 2 in relation to one another, as<br>
represented in figure 6, offers the advantage that the<br>
height H2 over which the panel 2 to be uncoupled has to be<br>
rotated before it is detached, also remains relatively<br>
small, as a result of which the disadvantage mentioned in<br>
the introduction is minimised.<br>
Moreover, the panels 2, according to the second aspect of<br>
the invention, preferably also have a length L which<br>
amounts to at least eight times the width B.<br>
Preferably, the panels 2 made according to the second<br>
aspect of the invention, also have a single pattern which<br>
is repeated ever the entire top surface, in particular a<br>
wood pattern.<br><br>
Figure 9 illustrates the third aspect of the invention.<br>
According to this third aspect, the invention concerns a<br>
floor covering 1 consisting of hard panels 2 with a<br>
laminated structure, having a decorative layer 25 on the<br>
top surface, characterised in that bevels 15 or such are<br>
formed on one or several edges 3 to 6 of the panels 2, near<br>
the top side, and in that the surface of these bevels 15 or<br>
such is also provided with a decorative layer, in this case<br>
a print 26, which is preferably, obtained as a print layer<br>
has been provided on
printing.<br>
The decorative layer 25 may as such consist of several<br>
layers, but it preferably contains at least one layer<br>
imprinted with a pattern, for example a wood pattern<br>
printed on a paper layer. In this case, the print 26 can<br>
be realised on the bevels 15 or such with a similar<br>
pattern. As a printing technique is applied for the<br>
decorative layer as well as for the print 26, it is very<br>
easy to match both patterns as far as colour and/or design<br>
are concerned.<br>
As mentioned in the introduction, the print 26 is<br>
preferably moisture-proof, impermeable respectively. Thus<br>
is obtained a sealing on the bevels 15, which is<br>
particularly useful when the panels have a porous core, for<br>
example made of MDF or HDF.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 schematically represent how the print 26<br>
can be provided on the surface 27 by means of transfer<br>
printing. A support 28 which is provided with a printing<br><br>
layer 29 is put into contact with the surface 21 and is<br>
applied with a preferably heated press-on roller 30, as a<br>
result of which the printing layer 29 adheres to the<br>
material of the panel 2 and comes off the support 28, so<br>
that the above-mentioned print 26 is created. The support<br>
28 with the printing layer 29 is hereby supplied as of a<br>
roller 31, whereas said support 28, after the printing<br>
layer 29 has been transferred to the surface 27, is rolled<br>
up on a roller 32.<br>
Other transfer printing techniques which are known as such<br>
are not excluded, however.<br>
It should be noted that, both as far as the above-mentioned<br>
first aspect and the third aspect are concerned, according<br>
to a preferred embodiment, one or several, and preferably<br>
all bevels 15 extend at such an angle that the extension,<br>
determined by said bevel 15, is situated outside the<br>
contour of the panel 2 or just touches it, as indicated by<br>
the lines W in figures 3, 4 and 10. This is advantageous<br>
in that, both when the bevels 15 are applied and when the<br>
print 26 is applied, these bevels 15 are easily accessible<br>
to the machine parts used thereby.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the invention, it concerns<br>
a floor covering consisting of hard panels 2 with a core 23<br>
on the basis of MDF or HDF, or a similar material,<br>
characterised in that the panels 2 are each separately<br>
provided with an underlayer 36 made of synthetic material<br>
or another dampening or insulating material provided on the<br><br>
bottom side and fixed onto it, preferably made of<br>
polyethylene or on the basis of polyethylene, as<br>
represented in figure 12. The combination of these<br>
materials offers the advantage that little sound is<br>
produced when these panels 2 are walked on.<br>
The above-mentioned underlayer 36 can be fixed to the<br>
bottom side of the panel 2 in any way whatsoever, for<br>
example by means of gluing or by melting it onto it. In<br>
the case of a conventional laminate construction, the<br>
structure thus consists of the decorative layer 25, the<br>
core 23, usually on the basis of MDF or HDF, a counterlayer<br>
37, and the above-mentioned underlayer 36.<br>
It is clear that the fourth aspect of the invention can be<br>
used in combination with floor panels which are provided-<br>
with a conventional tongue and groove on their edges, as<br>
well as in combination with floor panels with coupling<br>
means which provide for a horizontal and a vertical<br>
interlocking, for example coupling means 7 as described<br>
above.<br>
The invention is by no means limited to the above-described<br>
embodiments represented in the accompanying drawings; on<br>
the contrary, such a floor covering, and in particular the<br>
above-mentioned panels, can be made in all shapes and<br>
