A process for preparing synergistic fixed dose pharmaceuticai composition<br>
Fieid of the Present Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic pharmaceutical composition useful in alleviating pain. It relates to the composition comprises ibuprofen of concentration ranging between 25 to 40%, paracetamol of concentration ranging between 40 to 60, and caffeine of concentration ranging between 2 to 10%, optionally along with pharmaceutically acceptable additives.<br>
Background and prior art references<br>
Commercially Ibuprofen is available as a conventional tablet and has been reformulated and presented as a melt in the mouth tablet. Similarly Paracetamol is also available as a conventional tablet and it has been improved by use of pharmaceutically acceptable additives upon to Paracetamol actifast or PANADOL actifast tablets. PANADOL is improved by addition of GRAS (Generally regarded as safe) additives. Ibex is improved by changing physical characteristics.<br>
Paracetamol has antipyretic and mild analgesic actions together with some antiinflammatory activity. These effects are related to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. The absolute oral bioavailability is about 80 % and is independent of dose in the range 5-20 mg/kg. It is indicated for the relief of mild to moderate pain of diverse etiology. It is less effective when pain is associated with acute inflammation.<br>
Ibuprofen has prominent anti-inflammatory effects in addition to having analgesic and antipyretic actions. The analgesic effects of ibuprofen are the result of both a peripheral and a central effect and are distinct from its property as an antiinflammatory drug. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis in tissues by inhibiting the enzyme cyclooxygenase. Ibuprofen is effective in relieving pain and reducing the<br><br>
temperature in febrile patients. It is also a useful anti-inflammatory drug in the treatment of inflammatory disorders.<br>
Caffeine has analgesic, CNS stimulant, diuretic and bronchodilator effects. The analgesic activity of caffeine results from several mechanisms: 1) blockade of peripheral pronociceptive actions of adenosine 2) activation of central nonadrenergic pathways that constitute an endogenous pain suppressing system 3) CNS stimulation with a consequent modulation of the affective component of pain. Caffeine is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration.<br>
Since paracetamol has only mild anti-inflammatory activity and since it is less effective when pain is associated with acute inflammation, ibuprofen, which has prominent anti-inflammatory effect, is combined with paracetamol to make the formulation effective in the treatment of painful / inflammatory conditions.<br>
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF COMBINATION THERAPY<br>
1.	When two or more drugs produce synergistic effect because of different modes of action.<br>
2.	When toxicity or side effects of two or more drugs are better tolerated than maximum doses of individual drugs due to lesser doses of individual drugs in the combination.<br>
3.	When a single drug does not result in complete response, minimum effective dose of another drug can be added.<br>
4.	When treatment is aimed at conditions involving more than one causes.<br>
JUSTIFICATION IN SUPPORT OF COMBINATION THERAPY:<br>
1	There is sufficient ground for all drugs being given together.<br><br>
2	Combination produces efficacy that is not achievable with the individual drugs.<br>
3	Combination results in some synergistic effect due to different modes of action.<br>
4	Combination is better tolerated due to avoidance of maximum doses of individual drugs.<br>
5	Individual   drugs   are  compatible   in   terms   of  their  pharmacokinetic characteristics.<br>
6	There is no drug-drug interaction resulting in blockade of response of one by the other drug.<br>
7	Drug interactions from combination therapy do not result in any significant adverse consequences.<br>
8	Doses of individual drugs are such that flexibility is not compromised due to fixed dose combination.<br>
RELATIVE ADVANTAGES OF FIXED DOSE COMBINATION:<br>
1	Fixed dose combination (FDC) results in better patient compliance due to less number of tablet a patient has to take and lesser side effects.<br>
2	FDC is convenient for a patient to carry to work place as compared to different packs of individual drugs.<br>
3	Cost-effective for the patient compared to cost of individual drugs.<br><br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention, wherein the binder is prepared at temperature ranging between 30 to 75^C.<br>
The Present invention relates to a composition particularly adapted to oral administration wherein the actives are immediately released upon administration. The composition is comprised of cores containing actives Paracetamol, Ibuprofen and caffeine in tablet, pellet or microtablet form. It is characterized in such a form that the actives are immediately released into the bloodstream leading to faster action and relief. A process for preparing the composition is disclosed. Invitro dissolution profile of Capsules versus Capsules containing Microtablets conducted in different time intervals is described in the detailed prior-art.<br>
This invention relates to the immediate release of combination of actives like Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and Caffeine that are in tablet, pellet or microtablet form for the treatment of pain. These Combinations are used as orally administrable pharmaceutical preparation that releases the actives immediately into the bloodstream on administration to provide faster action and immediate relief in the treatment of pain. The invention also relates to a process for preparing this composition.<br>
The present invention provides a method for treatment of pain comprising the concurrent administration of Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and caffeine in a microtablet, which results in immediate release of the actives for the treatment of pain. In our case by altering the product into microtablets, we have increased the surface area of the product exponentially thereby increasing the dissolution and hence absorption and thus action. The analgesia produced by the concurrent administration of Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and caffeine provides a rapid onset, providing greater pain relief and maintaining the analgesic effect for a longer<br><br>
time. This combination also provides an Anti-inflammatory and Antipyretic effect. In the state of pain and trauma there is fatigue and lack of coordination in the body, Caffeine acts as a stimulant and stimulates the central-nervous-system and increases energy metabolism throughout the brain. It also enhances the performance of an individual upon administration. This effect of increase in performance is propagated to Improved patient performance. The Invitro dissolution profile of Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and Caffeine Composition in conventional tablet form, powder in hard gelatin capsule form and in microtablet filled in capsule form is mentioned in the chart 1.<br>
CHART1 : Invitro Dissolution profile of Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and Caffeine from three different dosage forms :<br><br><br>
Note: — The above-mentioned data Indicates samples not analyzed as 100% drug has been released at the previous time interval.<br>
Chart 1 provides the dissolution profile of active in different dosage form. This chart substantiates the immediate release of our combination drug in Microtablet form. The actives in Microtablet form are dissolved in Gl track in less than 20 minutes i.e. --150 times much faster than other dosage forms. This immediate release facilitates faster action of the combination drug there by providing faster relief.<br>
The present invention comprises pharmaceutical compositions as Tablets, Pellets or Microtablets containing Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and Caffeine for combination therapy.<br>
In this preferred embodiment, the composition is in the form of micro-tablets enclosed inside a capsule, e.g. a gelatin capsule. For this, any gelatin capsule conventionally employed in the pharmaceutical formulation field can be used. The compositions of this invention are particularly suitable for oral administration of the active principles and are particularly suitable for alleviate pain.<br>
Rationale for Combination of Ibuprofen 200mg, Paracetamol 325mg and Caffeine 30mg.<br>
When treatment is aimed at conditions involving unknown / more than one cause there is sufficient ground for three drugs being given together.<br>
Paracetamol in the presence of Caffeine was approximately 1.4 times more potent (synergistic activity) than the analgesic without caffeine.<br><br>
A recent series of studies on postoperative oral surgery pain demonstrated significant adjuvant activity (synergistic activity) for caffeine in combination with Ibuprofen.<br>
The potency ratios for analgesic combinations containing caffeine range from 1.29 to 1.92 for paracetamol and 1 to 1.29 for ibuprofen.<br>
Ibuprofen and caffeine administered together provided significantly shorter times to meaningful improvement in headache relief than ibuprofen or placebo; and significantly greater total analgesia than ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone or placebo. Significantly more subjects obtained meaningful headache relief with ibuprofen and caffeine administered together than with ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone or placebo.<br>
One of the adverse reactions of ibuprofen is that it can precipitate bronchospasm in patients hypersensitive to NSAIDs particularly in patients with a past history of asthma when used alone\ Caffeine has bronchodilator effectV When ibuprofen and caffeine are administered together there are less chances of bronchospasm being precipitated in asthma patients since caffeine has bronchodilator effect.<br>
Studies document the analgesic efficacy of Paracetamol in dosage of 325 - 650 mg.<br>
A recent study showed that doses of IBUPROFEN, PARACETAMOL, AND CAFFEINE 200mg, 400mg are equally effective in the treatment of migraine.<br>
Section-1<br>
RATIONALE FOR IBUPROFEN 200 MG + PARACETAMOL 325 MG AND CAFFEINE 30 MG<br><br>
WHEN TREATMENT IS AIMED AT CONDITIONS INVOLVING MORE THAN ONE CAUSES THERE IS SUFFICIENT GROUND FOR THREE DRUGS BEING GIVEN TOGETHER<br>
The response to nociceptor sensory input is a multifactorial process, with both central and pehpheral mechanisms involved Several neurotransmitters participate in the transmission and modulation of this multifaceted process and thus, it is often difficult to achieve complete pain control using a single pharmacological agent without significant adverse events.<br>
Ibuprofen is a propionic acid derivative with anti-inflammatory / analgesic activity. It has clinically useful anti-inflammatory properties that result from its inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and other effects on the immune system.<br>
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is an analgesic and antipyretic.<br>
Paracetamol is effective in treating mild to moderate pain such as headache,<br>
neuralgia and musculoskeletal pain.<br>
Caffeine is a member of the group of chemically related alkaloids known as methylxanthines. Almost all organ systems can be influenced by the methylxanthines, although the predominant site of activity involves the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system. Caffeine acts as a mild stimulant to the nervous system, blocking the neurotransmitter adenosine and resulting in a feeling of well being and alertness. Caffeine also alters perception of pain.<br>
Section-ll<br>
COMBINATION PRODUCES EFFICACY THAT IS NOT ACHIEVABLE WITH THE INDIVIDUAL DRUGS.<br><br>
Ibuprofen is a good anti-inflammatory drug. However, pain relief with doses of Ibuprofen that can be easily tolerated by patients (200 mg three times daily) is not adequate. Paracetamol is an analgesic / antipyretic but has very little antiinflammatory activity. Its analgesic effect can be complemented by caffeine.<br>
For patients with migraine, long-term management can be difficult due to the complex nature of the condition. But new clinical guidelines, developed by the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American College of Physicians-American Society of Internal l\/ledicine, stress the importance of step care and patient education in the treatment and prevention of migraine.<br>
Step care should begin with the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"particularly aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen sodium, and the combination agent acetaminophen plus aspirin (or any other NSAIDs) plus caffeine as first-line treatment for acute attacks of any degree of severity. If the patient does not respond to NSAIDs, migraine-specific drugs should then be tried.<br>
Various studies have shown the effectiveness of the addition of caffeine to Ibuprofen and / or Paracetamol for acute pain.<br>
Ibuprofen and caffeine administered together provided significantly greater analgesic activity than ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone, and placebo. Ibuprofen and caffeine administered together demonstrated significantly shorter times to meaningful improvement in headache relief than ibuprofen or placebo; significantly greater total analgesia than ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone, or placebo; and significantly greater peak relief than ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone, or placebo. Significantly more subjects obtained meaningful headache relief with ibuprofen and caffeine administered together than with ibuprofen alone or placebo. More patients reported complete headache relief with ibuprofen and caffeine administered together than with ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone, or placebo. Ibuprofen and caffeine administered together was rated significantly<br><br>
better by patients than either ibuprofen alone, caffeine alone, or placebo. No subjects ended participation in the study early because of adverse events.<br>
Pooled data also demonstrated that a combination of NSAID like aspirin, acetaminophen and caffeine (Excedrin) was significantly better than placebo for nausea, photophobia, phonophobia, functional disability and pain relief in the treatment of migraine.<br>
Combination of Ibuprofen, paracetamol and caffeine is an effective antiinflammatory and analgesic in the treatment of inflammatory / painful conditions like rheumatoid arthritis (including juvenile rheumatoid arthritis or Still's disease), ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis and other non-rheumatoid (seronegative) arthropathies; in the treatment of non-articular rheumatic conditions, in periarticular conditions such as frozen shoulder (capsulitis), bursitis, tendonitis, tenosynovitis and low back pain; Ibuprofen can also be used in soft tissue injuries such as sprains and strains. Ibuprofen is also indicated for its analgesic effect in the relief of mild to moderate pain such as dysmenorrhoea, dental and postoperative pain and for symptomatic relief of headache, including migraine headache.<br>
Section-Ill<br>
COMBINATION RESULTS IN SYNERGISTIC EFFECT DUE TO DIFFERENT MODES OF ACTION<br>
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen reduce inflammation by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis at the site of inflammation. NSAID's may also act to a limited extent in reducing prostaglandin formation centrally and thus provide certain amount of relief from pain.<br>
Paracetamol acts on the CNS to produce analgesia and antipyretic effect. It has got negligible anti-inflammatory action in therapeutic doses.<br><br>
Caffeine produces intrinsic antinociceptive actions in animal models and adjunctive analgesic properties in humans. These properties are due to multiple actions of adenosine on the transmission of noxious sensory information.<br>
Inflammation is one of the body's prime responses when the body is in a state of disease. Inflammatory response of the body could be due to any insult or injury that could have occurred. Of the five classical symptoms of inflammation (redness, heat, pain, edema and functional limitations), the most common one would be pain.<br>
A physician treating inflammatory disorders is primarily concerned with treating inflammation while the patient's main need is quicl<pain relief.></pain>
This is the rationale behind the combination of an anti-inflammatory like Ibuprofen, an analgesic like paracetamol and a mood-elevating agent like caffeine.<br>
Since inflammation and pain co-exist in many situations, the scope exists across specialties for the use of fixed dose combination of ibuprofen, paracetamol and caffeine.<br>
ALL THE DRUGS ARE COMPATIBLE IN TERMS OF THEIR PHARMACOKINETIC CHARACTERISTICS<br>
The usually recommended adult dosage of ibuprofen is 200-400 mg in 3 times<br>
daily doses.<br>
The usually recommended adult dosage of paracetamol is 325-650 mg three<br>
times daily.<br>
The usually recommended adult dosage of Caffeine in oral analgesic preparation<br>
is 15-65 mg three times daily.<br><br>
Both ibuprofen and paracetamol are rapidly and completely absorbed following oral administration. Peak serum concentrations are achieved between 15 min and 2 hour for paracetamol and between 1 hour and 2 hours for ibuprofen. Oral administration of caffeine results in very good bioavailability. There is little evidence that food delays absorption of caffeine.<br>
Section-IV<br>
Rationale for addition of caffeine to Ibuprofen and Paracetamol<br>
One major rationale for combination is to add minimum effective dose of another drug wlien adequate dose of initial drug has not produced complete/ sufficient response or when the patients do not tolerate the maximum therapeutic doses of the individual drugs.<br>
Patients who are not getting adequate pain relief from the available combination of Ibuprofen 200 mg and Paracetamol 325 mg can shift to Ibex. (All drugs are within therapeutic dose range).<br>
Some patients may not very well tolerate higher doses of Ibuprofen. The analgesic effect of Paracetamol is seen with 1500mg to 4000mg/ days, which may not be very well tolerated by patients. Addition of caffeine reduces the requirement for higher doses both Ibuprofen and Paracetamol for the analgesic effect i.e., in-patients suffering from moderate to severe painful conditions.<br>
There is no increased toxicity as the total intakes of all the drugs are well within the recommended therapeutic doses of individual drugs.<br>
Indications<br><br>
Fixed dose combination tablet of ibuprofen 200mg, Paracetamol 325mg plus caffeine 30 mg (Ibex) is indicated for the treatment of migraine and tension type headache.<br>
Ibex is also indicated for the treatment of painful / inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, oesteoarthritis, cervical spondolosis, ankylosing spondylitis and other sero-negative arthropathies; soft tissue rheumatic conditions such as tendinitis, fibrosistitis, myositis, bursitis, capsulitis and low back pain; infective inflammatory conditions such as tonsillitis, pharyngitis, otitis media, pharyngitis, and inflammatory conditions in gynecology, urology and ophthalmology; soft tissue injuries such as sprains, strains, sports injuries, lacerated wounds and other accidental injuries including fracture and post operative wounds; dental inflammatory conditions such as alveolar abscesses, periodontitis, following dental extractions and maxillofacial surgeries; and dysmenorrhoea in adults.<br>
Dosage and administration<br>
The recommended dosage of Ibex is one to two tablet 3 times daily.  The daily intake of all ingredients (ibuprofen, paracetamol and caffeine) is well within the maximum daily recommended doses. Section-V<br>
Regulatory status in other countries<br>
Fixed dose combinations of an NSAID, acetaminophen (paracetamol) and caffeine are in regular clinical use abroad for decades and there is no serious adverse events reported with these combinations.<br>
Absence of untoward drug-drug interactions<br>
No   untoward   drug-drug   interactions   or  adverse   clinical   consequence   are<br><br>
