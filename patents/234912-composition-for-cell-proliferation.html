Examples<br><br>
The present invention is described in further detail with reference to Examples and Formulation Examples. The scope of the invention is not limited to these Examples, however. In the following Examples and Formulation Examples, percentages are all by weight unless otherwise specified. Example 1 In vitro cultured human keratinocyte cell proliferation promoting effect<br>
Primary-cultured human keratinocyte (manufactured by Kurabo Industries, Ltd.) was cultured in a 10-cm petri dish, and the cultured cells were collected in the subconfluent state and then stored in a frozen state. The following experiments were conducted using those cryopreserved cells.<br>
1.	The cryopreserved cells were dissolved in HuMediaKG2<br>
liquid culture media (manufactured by Kurabo Industries, Ltd.),<br>
the cell concentration was adjusted to 500000 cells/ml. 50<br>
(j,l of thus obtained cells-containing solution was poured into<br>
each well of a test plate to adjust the cell concentration to<br>
2500 cells/50nl/well.<br>
2.	Adenosine monophosphate disodium solutions and<br>
uridine  monophosphate  disodium  solutions  at  various<br>
concentrations were prepared using a sterilized phosphate<br>
buffer solution, and then they were filtered, followed by<br>
sterilization. To these was added a sterilized HuMediaKG2<br>
liquid medium (manufactured by Kurabo Industries, Ltd.) to<br>
prepare culture media containing subject-solutions with<br><br>
various dilution factors.<br>
3.	Six hours after injecting cells into the plate wells,<br>
it was confirmed that human keratinocyte cells adhered to the<br>
wells. One of the culture media containing subject-solutions<br>
with various dilution factors (250 nl each) prepared as<br>
described above was added to each well to prepare test samples<br>
(total 300 fil each). The test samples were cultured at 37°C<br>
under 5% CO2 for two days. The test samples contained solutions<br>
at various concentrations prepared by blending uridine<br>
monophosphate disodium to adenosine monophosphate disodium<br>
solutions in which the concentration of adenosine monophosphate<br>
contained in the 300 [il of the test sample was adjusted to 0,<br>
0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 W/V%, so that the concentration<br>
of uridine monophosphate disodium was adjusted to 0, 0.000001<br>
(1E-06), 0.00001 (1E-05), 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 w/v% as<br>
calculated based on the concentration of the uridine<br>
monophosphate.<br>
4.	Two days after culture initiation, the proliferation<br>
of human keratinocyte cells was measured using a WST-1 reagent<br>
(manufactured by TaKaRa) based on the rise in absorbance. More<br>
specifically, 200 jil was removed from the cultured test sample<br>
(300 fil) in each well, 10 [xl of the WST-1 reagent was added<br>
to each of the remaining 100 pi, followed by agitation, and<br>
the result was reacted in an incubator at 37°C under 5% CO2<br>
for two hours. After the reaction was complete, absorbance<br><br>
was measured at a measurement wavelength of 450 nm and at a control wavelength of 690 nm using a multiscan ascent to evaluate from the measured absorbance the presence of cell proliferation and its extent. 10 ^1 of the WST-1 reagent was added to 100 Hi of HuMediaKG2 liquidmedia (manufactured by Kurabo Industries, Ltd.) to form a blank solution.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the abscissa represents the concentration of each uridine monophosphate<br>
disodium (UMP»2Na) sample, and the ordinate designates the number of cells at each concentration thereof with respect to the concentration of each adenosine monophosphate disodium sample (specifically, the concentration of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)) co-used with the uridine monophosphate disodium. Fig.l shows the relative ratio (ratio of cont.) of the number of cells (ordinate) relative to the number of cells of a comparative sample set as 1. The comparative samples ware prepared by adding no uridine monophosphate disodium to solutions containing adenosine monophosphate disodium (0, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1 and 1 w/v%).<br>
Fig. 1 shows that the cell proliferation promoting effect of adenosine monophosphate disodium is potentiated and promoted by blending uridine monophosphate disodium as the pyrimidine nucleic acid-related substance into adenosine monophosphate disodium as the purine nucleic acid-related substance.
