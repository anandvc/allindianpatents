PEG-CONVEYING DEVICE FOR TEXTILE RING SPINNING AND TWISTING MACHINE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a peg-conveying device for textile ring spinning and twisting machines for the conveyance pegs loaded with cops and empty pegs. The present invention particularly relates to a peg-conveying device' for an uninterrupted displacement of the unloaded pegs in the unloading region of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine. Background and related art<br>
The usage of ring spinning machines for the production of yam is known. Normally the ring-spinning machine comprises a spindle rail to carry a predetermined number of spindles arranged at predetermined pitch arranged on both side of the machine. The conical tubes on which the yam is wound are fitted to the spindles and driven by suitable drive means. Ring rails are arranged coaxial to the spindle rail carries spinning ring and traveler assembly of same number and pitch as that of spindle. The ring rails further provided with means for travel up and down in a direction perpendicular to the spindle axis for the built up of yam on to the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles. Roving bobbins of equal number as that of the spindles are arranged in a creel member attached to the ring spinning machine for the introduction of roving into the drafting arrangement through suitable guide means and drafted. The drafting arrangement essentially comprises rear, middle and front bottom rollers with top drafting rollers associated with them. The drafting rollers are driven at differential speed by the drive system of the machine such that middle drafting rollers being driven at a faster peripheral speed than that of the rear drafting rollers and the front drafting rollers being driven at a faster peripheral speed than that of the middle drafting rollers to facilitate drafting. Guide arms attached to the drafting system rotatably support the top rollers as well as apply the required drafting pressure to the drafting rollers through suitable means. The conical tubes are attached to the spindles and driven by the spindle drive system and the drafted roving is subsequently wound on conical tubes by the ring and ring traveler assembly and the cop built up takes place. Soon after the conical tubes are filled with predetermined length of yam, the spindles are stopped and the cop is replaced with empty conical tubes and the machine is subsequently restarted.<br>
Modem ring spinning machines are constructed with spindles in the order of more than 1200. Replacing of the cop with empty conical tubes known as doffing requires more<br><br>
manpower and time consuming. Accordingly, modem Ring Spinning machines employ auto doffers with a mechanism of pegs moving in peg trays. The peg tray forms a closed loop and houses plurality of pegs to carry and position the conical tubes on to the spindles as well as to receive the cops and to transport them to the unloading zone of the ring spinning and twisting machine. Pushing means are arranged on both sides of the machine for the displacement of the pegs in the peg tray in the longitudinal direction of the machine.<br>
The doffer further comprises a tube loader, gripper rail and an intermediate peg tray. Conical tubes are loaded into the pegs arranged in the peg tray by the tube loader and displaced along the row of spindles so that each conical tube is positioned in front of respective spindle. Soon after the cop built up is completed, conical tubes present in the pegs are exchanged with the full bobbins otherwise known as cops and the pegs carrying the cops are subsequently transported to the unloading zone of the machine. At the unloading zone, suitable means are provided to unload the cops and the pegs are transported to the tube loading area where the conical tubes are loaded on to the pegs by the tube loader and subsequently transported to the doffing zone. In this manner, the pegs move around the machine to receive and transport the empty conical tubes or the cops as the case maybe.<br>
Normally, in ring spinning and twisting machines spindles are arranged in rows on both sides of the machine. Modem Ring Spinning and Twisting machines employ longitudinal peg trays for the conveyance of the pegs to transport the empty conical tubes and the cops carried by them. The longitudinal peg trays are arranged on the respective sides of the machine and are connected by horizontal peg trays arranged in the direction perpendicular to the longitudinal direction and forms an endless loop for the conveyance of pegs.<br>
Since, pushing elements such as pushers are used for pushing the pegs carrying the cop/empty conical tubes in the longitudinal direction of the machine. The pegs carrying the cops pushed by the pusher are arranged at the unloading area. The cops carried by the pegs are delivered at the unloading area and the empty pegs are dropped from the vertical peg trays and reach the horizontal peg tray connecting the unloading area and the tube loading area. Generally, due to accumulation of fibres in the horizontal peg tray, during the course of working of the machine, obstructs the free flow of the empty pegs, resulting in misalignment or incorrect positioning of pegs undemeath the tube loader to receive em.pty conical tubes. Therefore, a desired kinetic potential drive is required to ensure the<br><br>
correct displacement of empty pegs and position them underneath the tube loader for the loading of empty conical tubes.<br>
Further, the potential energy offered by the pegs in the peg tray on the horizontal pegs may not be sufficient to over come the frictional resistance developed on the peg by external means viz,, clogging of fibers over the peg, deposition of dust etc., during the course of working of machine resulting in a gap formation between each successive peg. These intervening gaps may result in interruption of tube loading cycles as result of generation of empty pegs even after the loading cycle.<br>
A type of arrangement disclosed in JP9049130A2 includes a peg tray constituted by forming a bending part at the so as to direct the pegs carrying the cops in a down ward direction to facilitate the dropping of cops its self weight from the pegs and then connecting to a vertical part and an horizontal conveying part at the end part of the outer end of a spinning machine. Objects of the present invention<br>
Accordingly, the primary object of the present invention is to provide a peg-conveying device for an uninterrupted displacement of the pegs in the unloading region of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a peg-conveying device with a peg tray with a substantially reduced vertical section for generating desired potential energy and to ensure smooth displacement of the pegs in the unloading region. Summary of the present invention<br>
To this end, according to the present invention, there is provided a peg-conveying device with a tray for textile ring spinning and twisting machine for an uninterrupted displacement of empty pegs in the unloading region of said peg-conveying tray and to transport said pegs to a loading section. The peg-conveying tray is provided with a substantially reduced vertical section extending from a loop portion of said tray and forming a loop terminal curvature section to hold lesser number of unloaded pegs as received from said loop portion, said combination of vertical section and curvature forming an arc to operably control the transport of the unloaded pegs, an inclined straight section extending fi*om said arc and terminating in a straight section curvature, said inclined section disposed in plane perpendicular to said arc to generate a desired potential energy drive to said pegs, and a horizontal section extending from the straight section curvature of said inclined straight section to form a train of pegs resulting from<br><br>

Detailed description of the present invention<br>
The present invention will now be explained in further detail, by referring to some preferred embodiments shown in Fig 1-3. The present invention provides a peg-conveying device for reliable and uninterrupted displacement of the pegs in the unloading region of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine. Referring to Fig, 1, wherein the perspective view of the peg-conveying device in the unloading region of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine is depicted. The peg-conveying device of the present invention comprises an unending closed loop peg tray arranged with a plurality of curvaceous, horizontal and inclined portions. The different portions of the peg-conveying device at the unloading section of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine are depicted in Fig 1. The unloading section of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine originates at a first horizontal portion (HPl) of the peg tray of the peg-conveying device. The first horizontal portion (HPl) is in flow communication with one end of a first inclined straight portion (SPl) by means of a first curved portion (CPl). The other end of the first inclined straight portion (SPl) is connected to a loop portion (HP). The loop potion (HP) is provided with a suitable configuration, preferably an enlarged hairpin-shaped bend having curved bottom portion (BCP). The top region of the loop portion (HP) is flat and extends into a parallel bottom portion. The flat top and bottom portions of the loop portion (HP) are connected by means of a bottom curvaceous portion (BCP). The flat bottom portion of said loop portion (HP) extends further into a substantially reduced vertical section (SP2), said substantially reduced vertical section extending from the loop portion (HP) of said tray and forming a loop terminal curvature section (CP2) to hold lesser number of unloaded pegs as received from said loop portion (HP), said combination of vertical section (SP2) and curvature<br><br>
(CP2) forming an arc to operably control the transport of the unloaded pegs. The substantial reduction of vertical section (SP2) is in the range of 30%, to hold lesser number of unloaded pegs. However, it is understood here that the reduction of the vertical section depends on desired inclination angle. An inclined straight section (SP3) extending from said arc and terminating in a straight section curvature (CP4), said inclined straight section (SP3) disposed in plane perpendicular to said arc to generate a desired kinetic potential drive to said pegs. A curvature (CP3) is disposed between (CP2) and (SP3) to permit the flow of unloaded pegs into inclined straight section (SP3). The inclined straight section (SP3) is inclined and makes an angle (A) (as shown in Fig 3) in the range of 30-45^, preferably about 30^ with respect to the ground. At the end of the inclined straight portion (SP3), a straight section curvaceous section (CP4) is disposed. The straight section curvaceous section (CP4) connects the inclined straight section (SP3) and a horizontal straight section of the peg tray (HP2). The horizontal section of the peg tray (HP2) is the final point in the unloading section of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine. The horizontal section (HP2) extends from the straight section curvature (CP4) of said inclined straight section (SP3) to form a train of pegs, without any intervening gaps as result of the desired kinetic potential drive generated in the inclined straight section (SP3). The formation of a train of pegs without intervening gaps among pegs ensures an uninterrupted displacement of pegs to the loading section. The formation of a train of pegs without intervening gaps as illustrated in Fig 2. The desired angle (A) (as shown in Fig 3) is provided to effect an inclination to inclined straight section (SP3) in order to provide a desired potential energy to form the train of pegs without intervening gaps is illustrated in Fig 2A and pictorially represented as F. This ensures that the downward displacement of the empty pegs (1) present in the region (CP3) and (CP4) by the means of gravitational force without any interruption. Working of the invention<br>
Generally, soon after the pre-determined length of yam is wound on the conical tube (3) attached to the revolving spindle the doffing cycle is initiated. During the doffing cycle the conical tubes (3) present in the pegs (1) located beneath the spindle rail are exchanged with the cops (2) by the auto doffer. Then the tube loader loads the conical tubes (3) on the pegs (1) present in the tube-loading zone. Subsequently the pegs (1) carrying the conical tubes (3) are displaced in the peg tray and reach the spindle rail area for subsequent exchange with cops (2) during the next doffing cycle. Simultaneously, the pegs carrying the cops (2) are pushed to the unloading zone.<br><br>
Now by specifically referring to Fig 2,2A &amp; 3, the working of the peg-conveying device of the present invention is explained. The pegs (1) loaded with cops (2) being pushed by the pusher arrangement (not shown) and the pegs (1) carrying the cops (2) reaches the first horizontal portion (HPl) of the peg-conveying device towards the first inclined straight portion (SPl) via the first curvaceous portion (CPl). The pegs (1) along with the cops (2) are fed at the first horizontal portion (HPl) one by one and each peg (1) along with a cop (2) is pushed further along the peg tray by the pushing means. When the pegs (1) carrying the cops (2) reach the bottom curvaceous portion (BCP) of the loop portion (HP) of the peg tray of the peg conveying device, the cops (2) are released and dropped on to a cop collection box kept on the floor of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine. Further the empty pegs (1) without the cops (2), reaches the substantially reduced vertical section (SP2) of the peg tray of the peg conveying device. The empty pegs (1) are further made to travel along the curvaceous portions (CP2 &amp; CP3) and finally reach the inclined straight section (SP3) of the peg tray of the pegging device. The inclined straight section (SP3) is disposed at an angle (A) with respect to the ground. The angle (A) is adopted in the range 30-45^, preferably 30^. The inclination incorporates the empty pegs delivered from unloading area with potential energy (pictorially represented as F - in Fig 2A) sufficient for its transfer to the tube loading area in the form of train of pegs without intervening gaps. This ensures that the downward displacement of the empty pegs (1) present in the region (CP3) and (CP4) by the gravitational force without any interruption. By adopting the device of the present invention having the inclined straight section (SP3), the resultant force due to potential energy F is enhanced more than twice, since the number of pegs that are facilitafing the desired potential energy is increased by the inclined straight section (SP3), said increased number overcomes the frictional resistance developed on the peg as a result of accumulation of fly particles either on the pegs or the peg tray during the course of working the machine. Therefore, this additional potential energy ensures uninterrupted tube loading cycles.<br>
Finally, on reaching the horizontal portion (HP2) the empty pegs (1) are pushed by pushing means into the tube loading area of the ring spinning and twisting machine and the empty pegs are loaded with new conical tubes (3) by means of a tube loader. The pegs (1) with the new conical tubes (3) are displaced underneath the spindle rail for subsequent exchange with cops. The pegs carrying the cops are again sent into the unloading area to continue the above cycle.<br><br>
