				<td>SHAPE PROCESSOR<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Graphical rendering of abstract shapes may require substantial processing of shape description data. Known methods for processing shapes may be found, for example, in the Java 2D API, which provides software tools for processing two dimensional vector graphics. However, there remains a need for a shape processing engine that reduces computational complexity to conserve processing resources, particularly in embedded systems that include display devices.<br>

The pre-processed shape data may include a clip mask. The pre-processed shape data may include a transparency. The pre-processed shape data may include a f ill. The method may further include storing intermediate processing data in a cache, the intermediate processing data including at least one of a clip mask, a fill, or a transparency.<br>
A method for image rendering described herein may include receiving an object to be displayed, the object including a shape and a fill; converting the shape of the object into a plurality of lines of encoded scan data having one of at least two possible states for pixels of a display including a first state and a second state, the first state representing a pixel inside the shape and the second state representing a pixel outside the shape; and blending each of the plurality of lines of encoded scan data and the fill into a line of a frame for the display.<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiment(s)<br>
To provide an overall understanding of the invention, certain illustrative embodiments will now be described, including a two-dimensional shape processor that employs spatial filtering and tone control for the edges of rendered objects. However, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that the methods and systems described herein may be suitably adapted to other applications, such as three-dimensional shape processing, and may be combined with full image anti-aliasing. For example, a crude full-image anti-aliasing step may be combined with fine antialiasing of object edges. All such adaptations and modifications that would be clear to one of ordinary skill in the art are intended to fall within the scope of the invention described herein.<br>
Figure 1 shows a data structure for a graphical object that may be used with a shape processor. The graphical object 100, or simply object 100, may include a bounding box 101, a shape 102, a fill 104, and an alpha 106. The shape 102 may include a path 108 with stroke 110 and fill 112 parameters, or a<br><br>
clip mask 114. The fill 104 may include a color 116 or a bitmap 118. The alpha 106 may include a value 120 or a mask 122.<br>
The bounding box 101 may include a location where the object 100 is to be rendered, and may define a region into which the object is to be drawn. This parameter may be used, for example, to simplify rendering of an arc by combining a circular path wj.th a bounding box 101 that overlays one quadrant of the circle.<br>
The shape 102 may include a path 108 that defines a sequence of path elements connected using a PostScript-style path description. Other path representations are known and may also be used. The path 108 may include, for example, straight line segments, Bezier curves with a direction and a curvature controlled by two points, or other path constructs. The path 108 may be open or closed. In order to support more complex geometries, the path 108 may include self-intersecting or multiple disjoint regions. The stroke 110 for the path 108 may include parameters or attributes, including, for example, join attributes that specify rendering for joined path elements, such as round, beveled, or mitered, and cap attributes that specify rendering for an end of the path 108, such as round, butt, square, triangular, and so forth. The fill 112 may include a winding rule or other algorithm or parameter for distinguishing an inside of the path 108  from an outside  of  the path  108,  so  that<br><br>
suitable regions may be filled. The clip mask 114 may include a pointer to a cached rendering of the graphical object 100, in order to reduce redundant processing of recurring objects.<br>
The fill 104 may generally include information concerning how a shape 102 is to be filled. This may include, for example, a color 116, which may be a color value defined on a palette, such as an 8-bit palette, or may be a component based color such as 24-bit RGB, 15-bit RGB, or 32-bit CMYK, or the color 116 may be a gray scale value. The fill 104 may include a bitmap 118 that includes a bitmap of a texture to be used for filling the shape 102. The bitmap 118 may instead include a pointer to:a bitmap to be used for filling the shape 102. Such a bitmap may be provided in any variety of color model, such<br>
as those used for the fill 104.<br>
*<br>
The alpha 106 may generally include information relating to a transparency of the shape 102 when filled and displayed. The alpha may include a value 120 that is a single value describing transparency for an entire shape 102, typically ranging from zero (transparent) to one (opaque). Optionally, the alpha 106 may include a mask 122 that is an alpha mask, or pointer to an alpha mask, of values for each pixel of the rendered shape 102,<br>
Suitable adaptations of, and enhancements to, the above data structures will be clear to one of skill in the art.   In particular, the graphical<br><br>
object 100 may include other features described in rendering specifications such as PostScript, the Java 2D API, or the Quartz and QuickDraw libraries used, for example, in the Mac OS X operating system.<br>
Figure 2 is a functional block diagram of a shape processor. Generally, the shape processor 200 provides an input mechanism for receiving a stream of graphical objects, and includes an object processor that processes the stream of objects on an object by object basis to create a pixel array for display on a screen. The shape processor 200 receives a graphical object described by a shape, shown in Fig. 2 as path 202, a bounding box 203, a fill 204, and an alpha 2 06 &gt; which may correspond, for example, to the components of the graphical obj ect 100 described above in reference to Fig. 1. The shape processor 2 00 may receive a clip mask 232 instead of a path 202, which may be passed by the shape processor 200 directly to a scan line blender 226, as will be described below.<br>
Control data for the shape processor 2 00 may include a screen bounding box 208, a smoothness 210, a tone response curve 212, a bit depth 214, a color space 216, and a screen base address 218. This control data may store physical parameters relating to a display, such as the screen base address 218 or the tone response curve 212. The tone response curve 212 may adjust the grayscale values of the encoded scan data, as described below, according to non-linearities for a display device.  For example,<br><br><br>
an intensity value of 50% of full scale may result in a pixel intensity of 65% for a particular device. The tone response curve 212 may adjust for such non-linearities using a look-up table or some other algorithmic or look-up-based approach. Other control data may correspond to parameters specified by a user (or programmer). For example, the smoothness 210, which stores a value for a fineness or granularity of edge processing, may be a value (or values) describing an NxN matrix of sub-regions each display pixel, as will be described below.<br>
The path 202 is provided to a scan converter 220, which, using data from an intersection 221, provides intersection ,data to an intersection buffer 222. An intersection process 224 further processes the intersection data, and provides an output to a scan line blender 226, which combines the output with other graphical object descriptors and control data to generate an output to a video memory or a physical display. Intermediate data generated by the shape processor 2 00 may include a path bounding box 228, a flattened path 230, and a clip mask 232. The clip mask 232 or flattened path 230 can be used independently of the shape- processor 200 or may be re-presented as valid input, thereby reducing redundancy of repeated calls to the shape processor 2 00. Other intermediate data (not shown) may be generated by the shape processor 2 00 for output, including as examples, intersected inputs or other pre-processing adjustments such as decompression of<br><br>
fill maps, and color space conversions, corrections, adjustments, and scaling.<br>
Prior to scan line processing, the scan converter 22 0 may preprocess the path 2 02. For example, unnecessary scan conversions may be avoided by intersecting certain data and determining whether processing is required. For example, the bounding box 2 03 for the path 2 02 and the screen bounding box 208 may be intersected in the intersection 221. If the output from the intersection 221 is null, then no further processing is required. Although not shown explicitly in Fig. 2, other intersections may be obtained, such as an intersection with a bounding box for the fill 204 (which may be inferred by the shape processor 200 from the fill data) , or a bounding box for the alpha 2 06 (which may again be inferred by the shape processor 2 00 from the alpha data). If an intersection set is null, no processing is required for the path 202 and a next sequential path 202 may be processed immediately. As noted above, if a clip mask 232 is presented as a shape, instead of the path 202, the clip mask 232 may be passed directly to the scan line blender 226, thus bypassing scan conversion and other path processing steps. Any intermediate processing data may be stored in this manner to avoid or reduce redundant processing, including, for example, the clip mask 232, fill data, alpha data, flattened path data, and so forth.<br><br>
The scan converter 22 0 may convert the path 2 02 into intersections with scan lines of a target display device. This function may be performed on an up-sampled basis, using the smoothness 210. That is, prior to locating intersections, each line of pixels may be divided into sub-pixel regions, or sub-pixel matrixes, using the smoothness 210 as a parameter. So, for example, a smoothness 210 of two may result in a scan line of one-hundred pixels being processed to generate intersection data as a two by two-hundred array of sub-pixel regions covering the same area of a screen display. A smoothness 210 of four may result in the same scan line being processed to generate intersection data as a four by four-hundred array of sub-pixel regions, and so forth.<br>
The path 202 may then be applied to the sub-pixel* regions. The resulting intersections, or intersection data, may be stored on a horizontal, line-by-line basis, including an x-coordinate for each intersection, along with a direction (e.g., up or down) in which the path intersects a horizontal axis. Other representations are known, and may also be used by the scan converter 220. The scan converter 220 may generate the path bounding box 228. The scan converter 230 may also generate a flattened path 230 as an intermediate step, in which continuous, non-linear segments, such as Bezier curves, are converted to a number of straight path segments. This may reduce the computational complexity of operations associated with the path.<br><br>
The  intersection  data  may  be  stored  in  the intersection buffer 222.<br>
In general, the intersection process 224 analyzes rows of sub-pixel regions and identifies runs of pixels that are outside a shape, pixels that are inside a shape, and transition pixels. The transition pixels, those that are on the edges of a shape and intersect the shape so that they are partially inside and partially outside the shape, may be smoothed to remove or reduce jaggedness or other artifacts associated with rendering. This over-sampling technique is described below in more detail with reference to Fig. 3. Inside pixels, outside pixels, and transition pixels, may then be blended into video memory as will be described below.<br>
Figure 3 depicts an example of an operation on intersection data performed by the intersection process 224, In the example of Fig. 3, the intersection data corresponds to a scan line of one-hundred pixels, with a smoothness 210 having a value corresponding to a four-by-four sub-pixel matrix for each scan line pixel.<br>
A chart 301 shows intersection data received from the intersection buffer 222 of Fig, 2. As shown in the chart 301, the intersection data may generally include x-coordinates where the path 202 intersects sub-pixel regions, '.'oupled with a direction of the path 202,  For the first row. Row<br><br>
N, the path 202 intersects the 40th sub-pixel in an upward direction. On the same rcw, the path 202 intersects the . 140th sub-pixel in a downward direction. Intersection data is also set forth in the chart 301 for Rows N+1 through N+3. It will be appreciated that this is a specific example, and that more or less intersection data may be provided for a row of sub-pixel regions depending on the complexity of the path 202.<br>
The intersection data may be processed to extract runs of 'on' or 'off according to a winding rule or similar method. In the example shown in Fig. 3, the intersection data of the chart 301 may be processed in this manner to generate the encoded data of a chart 302 by application of an even/odd winding rule, in this example.<br>
As depicted in the chart 3 02, data for each row of sub-pixels may be encoded as a data pair including an on/off flag and a run of adjacent sub-pixels in the row sharing the on/off flag. In general; the end of a run may identified by a transition from inside to outside, or vice versa, as determined by applying a winding rule or similar technique to the intersection data. From this data, runs of pixels may be extracted, reflecting pixels of the target display that will be completely inside or outside the shape that is described by the intersection data. In the example of the chart 302, a first run of five 'off pixels that are outside the shape may be readily recognized, corresponding<br><br>
to Rows N through N+3,  and horizontal sub-pixel regions 1-20.<br>
As depicted in chart 304, the transition from 'off runs to *on' runs may be characterized by the number of 'on' or 'off sub-pixel regions for each row of sub-pixels. In the present example, the data after the first run of five 'off pixels may be grouped into collections of four sub-pixel regions corresponding to pixels, e.g., sub-pixel regions 21-24, 25-28, and so forth. The 'on' sub-pixel regions in each group of sub-pixel regions may then be summed over four rows to obtain a total number of 'on' sub-pixel regions for a pixel. The chart 304 shows this total for six horizontally consecutive pixels. The first of these pixels, corresponding to horizontal sub-pixel regions 21-24 and Rows N through N+3, includes no 'on' sub-pixel regions from Rows N through N+2, and four 'on' sub-pixel regions from Row N+3. This provides a total 'on' -ness for this pixel of four sub-pixel regions. This corresponds to a ratio of 4:16 or twenty-five percent (4/16 of the four-by-four sub-pixel matrix). This is represented as a twenty-five percent grayscale value for this pixel. This analysis may be repeated for horizontally consecutive sub-pixel regions until a fully 'on' pixel is reached. In the example of Fig. 3, an 'on' pixel is reached at sub-pixel region 41-44, where sixteen out of sixteen sub-pixel regions are 'on'. The corresponding pixel may begin a run of on' pixels to the end of a scan<br><br>
line, or until a next transition,  should such a transition occur.<br>
The resulting data for each scan line is represented as runs of *on' pixels, runs of 'off pixels, and one or more transition pixels that have grayscale values indicating how much of each transition pixel is inside (or alternatively, outside) a shape. Figure 4, below, shows an example of a data structure containing scan lines of data run-length encoded in this form. In some implementations, grayscale values may include the maximum or minimum grayscale value (e.g., 100% or 0%) , which otherwise represent pixels or runs that are *on' or 'off . This approach may be applied advantageously, for example, to optiffiize encoding of data that exhibits short runs that switch between 'on' and 'off .<br>
It will be appreciated that other techniques may be used to derive grayscale values for transition pixels. For example, the portion of a pixel that is inside a shape may be determined mathematically using point and slope information for the path 306. By smoothing shape edges into grayscale values, an achromatic anti-aliasing operation may be performed for a full color image. Color may be subsequently provided in a scan line blender, as will be described below.

The scan line blender 226 may output directly to a screen, to some other display device, or to a frame buffer for subsequent bitmap rendering. This may include a non-video memory or an output bitmap format buffer. The scan line blender 226 may typically operate on one line of video data, or row of pixels, at a time. In certain embodiments, a number of scan line blenders may be provided to operate on a number of scan lines in parallel. For each pixel, the scan line blender 226 may combine the fill 204 (e.g., a 24-bit color value), the alpha 206, and the intersection process 224 output (or clip mask, when available) corresponding to that pixel. In general, the fill . 204 is multiplied by alpha (for transparency (0

The blended output may be stored in the video memory for display. It will be appreciated that Eq. 1 is representative, and that other equations may be used to combine old and new data on a pixel-by-pixel basis, provided the equation weights old and new data suitably to reflect, for example, the transparency and the edges of new data. This may be, for example, a two step process in which edge weighting is performed first, followed by transparency weighting. In addition, there are degenerate forms of Eq. 1 that may be employed in the scan line blender 22 6 to reduce processing complexity. For example, when there is a run of pixels inside the shape that is fully opaque (i.e., e=l &amp; alpha = 1) , then the output of the scan line blender 226 is simply the fill value for each pixel. In this case, fill values, f, for the corresponding pixels may be provided directly to the video memory without further processing.<br>
Figure 4 shows a data structure for encoded scan data as output by the intersection process 224. Generally, pixel values may be stored as 'on' , 'off , or 'grayscale' . Pixels that are on correspond to pixels inside a shape, which will be rendered as color values provided by the fill 204 of Fig. 2. Pixels that are off correspond to pixels outside the shape, and will not affect the existing<br><br>
display or frame buffer. As noted above, additional parameters may be provided with an object, such as a background fill that provides fill values for 'off pixels, or pixels outside the shape. As another example, a replacement fill may be provided, which is subtracted from a previous value in the frame buffer prior to blending. Grayscale values represent shape edges, and will be rendered as color values provided by the fill 204, and scaled according to the grayscale value. The encoding provides a scheme for representing lines of video data that allows a significant reduction in processing costs when processing the shape. For example, encoding as runs of 'on' and 'off is inexpensive and grayscale calculations are less expensive on memory usage and processor time because they avoid the requirement of a full pixel array for<br>
image processing.    Additionally,  the  run-length<br>
«<br>
encoding provides a benefit when storing the video data as clip masks. However, it will be appreciated that other compression techniques may suitably be used with the systems described herein.<br>
The run-length encoded data structure 4 00 may include a header 402, a length 404, a width 406, a height 408, one or more offsets 410, and one or more data segments 412. The header 4 02 may include any header information useful for identifying or using the data structure 400. The length 404 may indicate a length of the data structure 400. The width 406 may indicate a value representative of a width, in pixels, of a shape.  The height 408 may indicate a<br><br>
value representative of a number of scan lines of a shape. The one or more offsets 410 indicate byte offsets to data segments for each scan line of a shape. The one or more data segments 412 each contain encoded data for a scan line of a shape. The data segments 412 may be represented as 'inside' followed by a run length, in pixels, 'outside' followed by a run length, in pixels, or 'edge', followed by a number of pixels in the edge and a grayscale value for each one of the number of pixels in the edge. Each edge value may be represented, for example, as one byte (256 levels) grayscale value,<br>
Figure 5: is a flow chart of a process for shape processing. In the following discussion, the phrase "intersection data" is intended to refer to data describing intersections between a path and sub-pixel regions. In a degenerate case, each sub-pixel region may correspond to a complete pixel, and no smoothing is thus performed. The phrase "encoded scan data" is intended to refer to data, in uncompressed or compressed (e.g., run-length encoded) form describing regions of a scan line in one of three states, namely on, off or grayscale. The runs are determined by a transition from inside to outside of a path as defined by applying a winding rule or similar technique to the intersection data.<br>
The process 500 may start 502 by receiving an obj ect, as shown in step 504.  The object may be,<br><br>
for example, the graphical object 100 described above in reference to Fig. 1. In an optional step 506, it is determined whether the object is in a cache. This determination may be made using, for example, the shape name or any other information that can uniquely identify the shape of the object as corresponding to an item in the cache. If the shape of the object is cached, then the process 500 may proceed to step 516 where the object may be blended with current video memory using the cached shape 4nd any fill and transparency data supplied with the object. If the shape is not cached, then the process 500 may proceed to step 508.<br>
. As seen in step 508, the process 500 may generate a flattened path, as described above in reference to the scan converter 220 of Fig. 2. The flattened path may then be used to generate intersection data representative of intersections between a path and sub-pixel regions, as shown in step 510. It may be understood that these intersections may be representative of the edges of a shape. As shown in step 512, encoded scan data may then be generated from the intersection data, as described above, for example, in reference to the intersection process 224 of Fig. 2. The encoded scan data, representative of an outline of the shape of the object, may be stored in the cache, as shown in step 514. The encoded scan data may then be blended with video memory, as shown in step 516, and as described in more detail in reference to the scan line blender 226 of Fig. 2.   The process 500 may<br><br>
then return to step 504, where a next consecutive object may be received.<br>
The video memory may provide frames of video data to a display where the contents of the video memory are converted to human-viewable form. The video memory may also store one or more frames of previous video data for blending with new lines of video data generated by the shape processor. It will be appreciated that the display may be a liquid crystal display, light-emitting diode display, or any other display for providing video data in human-viewable foirm. The display may also be a printer, plotter, or other device for reproducing video data in a fixed, tangible medium such as paper.<br>
It will be appreciated that the above process 500, and the shape processor 200 of Fig. 2, may be realized in hardware, software, or some combination of these. The process 500 may be realized in one or more microprocessors, microcontrollers, embedded microcontrollers, programmable digital signal processors or other programmable device, along with internal and/or external memory such as read-only memory, programmable read-only memory, electronically erasable programmable read-only memory, random access memory, dynamic random access memory, double data rate random aqpess memory, Rambus direct random access memory, flash memory, or any other volatile or non-volatile memory for storing program instructions, program data, and program  output  or  other  intermediate  or  final<br><br>
results. The process 500 and the shape processor 200 may also, or instead, include an application specific integrated circuit, a programmable gate array, programmable array logic, or any other device that may be configured to process electronic signals.<br>
Any combination of the above circuits and components, whether packaged discretely, as a chip, as a chipset, or as a die, may be suitably adapted to use with the systems described herein. It will further be appreciated that the above process 500 and shape processor 2 00 may be realized as computer executable code created using a structured programming language such as C, an object oriented programming language such as C++, or any otjaer high-level or low-level programming language that may be compiled or interpreted to run on one of the above devices, as well as heterogeneous combinations of processors, processor architectures, or combinations of different hardware and software.<br>
The shape processor 200 may be particularly suited to parallel and/or pipelined image processing systems where different graphical objects may be simultaneously processed, and then blended into a frame of video memory.  The shape processor 200 may thus be realized as a number of physically separate processes, or as a number of logically separate processes such as multiple shape processor threads executing on a microprocessor.  This approach may<br><br>
similarly be applied to different scan lines of a graphical object.<br>
