SUGARCANE PLANTER<br>
UNITED PHOSPHORUS LTD., A COMPANY REGISTERED UNDER INDIAN COMPANY'S ACT 1956 , HAVING ITS REGISTERED OFFICE AT 3 - 11, GD3C, VAPI - 396 195, STATE OF GUJARAT, INDIA AND HAVING ITS OFFICE AT UND7HOS HOUSE 11th ROAD , C.D.MARG, KHAR (WEST) MUMBAY , 400052, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA, INDIAN.<br>
The following description describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a farming implement in general and sugar cane planter in particular.<br>
BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Sugar cane planting is a labour intensive activity. Multiple tasks to be carried out by the farmers include - furrowing, planting the seeds (setts), providing the fertilizers, and covering the setts with soil. Maintaining adequate distance between the rows and harmonius synchronization of these activities and timely plantation in the right season are essential to ensure proper germination ,growth and better yield of sugar cane .<br>
With the current method of manual working with the number of labourers â€”co-ordinated activity is not achievable. It is also difficult to complete the planting in a large area with in the desired time frame which is crucial. This problem is further compounded by the non-availability of adequate skilled labourers as and when required.<br>
Automated sugar cane planters have definitely changed this scenario and made the task of sugar cane planting much more easier as compared to manual methods. Newer automated sugarcane planters are being introduced.<br>
2<br><br>
US patent no.5469797 illustrates sugar cane planters having fully automatic, hydrostatic pressure sensing systems for planting sugar cane in 3 or more rows at once.<br>
JP patent no. 11069902 describes an automatic sugar cane planter which can take sugar cane stems one by one from a stem storage chamber by a stem withdrawing means.<br>
US patent 4530293 illustrates a sugar cane billet planter which has a main bin and the billets are moved by a main billet elevator from the main bin to the sorter bin then to billet chute.<br>
JP patent no.2000262119 describes a multiple row planting machine which provides a whole culm-type multiple row planting machine capable of increasing the number of planting rows in one field.<br>
US patent no.5357882 describes another sophisticated planter with a large volume sugar cane billet storage bin with approx. 10,000 pound capacity.<br>
US patent no.5469797 describes a novel sugar cane planter which utilizes a fully automatic hydraulically driven feed and distribution system to plant cane stalks on the field in multiple rows.<br>
Many of these automated sugar cane planting machines, no doubt, provide better efficiency as compared to manual planting techniques. But they have their own drawbacks which include:<br>
3<br><br>
1.	Higher cost of the machine.<br>
2.	Expensive and difficult maintenance.<br>
3.	Need for high power Tractors.<br>
4.	Higher consumption of fuel<br>
5.	Inability of an average farmer to quickly adapt to the new sophisticated systems.<br>
6.	Difficulty in incorporating certain additional and essential steps like treatment with antifungals, useful soil bacteria - for better growth.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a sugarcane planter enabling the farmer to carry out in a single operation, the multiple functions with efficiency and economy and enabling him to plant larger area at a short span of time without extra labourer compared to conventional methods; At the same time free from the drawbacks of the modern automated sugar cane planter.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION:<br>
A sugar cane planter according to invention has a main supporting frame which can be hitched to a tractor. A cultivator (Ridger) for opening a furrow is mounted under the supporting frame. An elevated chair is mounted on the said supporting frame (on the proximal side with respect to the Tractor), facing the opposite direction of the movement of the tractor. Two seeds (setts) buckets for storing the seeds are mounted on the frame on both the sides of the chair. A seeds feed pipe is fitted in front of the chair, with its other end touching the ground at approximately 45 degrees and having a V- shaped wing like structure on the tip; it has an elliptical opening. Seeds (setts)<br>
4<br><br>
introduced through this feed pipe by the operator drops in to the furrow in a horizontal position because of the angleand the V- shaped structure helps in closing the furrow and covers the seeds with the soil. A fertilizer feed hopper is mounted in the centre of the supporting frame in front of the chair and has a mechanism for dispensing predetermined quantity of the fertilizer to the furrows through the fertilizer feed pipe which has its opening behind the tip of the cultivator.<br>
The mechanism consists of a shaft with a bucket fitted into it -which is driven by a rotor connected to a rotor driver unit; Rotor driver unit moves when the tractor is in motion. An adjustable row marker is attached by means of clamps on the extending arms on both the sides of the supporting frame to provide equidistance between the rows.<br>

A preferred embodiment of invention is shown in the accompanying drawings, where in;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFFERED EMBODIMENT<br>
The sugarcane planter shown in the drawings include a supporting frame (1) which can be hitched to a tractor. A cultivator ( ridger ) (2) is mounted centrally under the support frame for opening of the furrow chair(seat)(l 1) for the operator is fixed on the support frame in centre of the support frame with seed buckets(3) on both the sides for storing the seeds (setts). The seeds are introduced by the operator through the seed feed piper (4) fitted in front of the operator. The seed pipe is kept at an angle of approximately 45Â° with the soil surface and has an elliptical opening, both of which help in dropping the setts in the furrows in a horizontal position to facilitate germination. The wing like V-shaped structure on the tip of the seeds feeder pipe helps in closing the furrows and covering the setts with the soil .An elevated seat (11) mounted on the frame facing the direction opposite to that of the motion of the tractor; This helps the operator to<br>
6<br><br>
observe and confirm whether the setts and fertilizers are properly being placed in the furrow and the furrow is being properly closed.<br>
A fertilizer feed hopper mounted on the centre of the supporting frame in front of the chair (5) delivers predetermined quantity of fertilizer to the furrows through the fertilizer feed pipe(8) by a mechanism which consists of a shaft fitted with a bucket - and which is driven by a rotor (6). The rotor is connected to a rotor driver unit (7) which moves because of the pedal like structure when the tractor is in motion. This implement with a single operator and in a single operation thus ensures proper furrowing, delivery of the fertilizer into the furrows, horizontal placement of the seeds in the furrows and subsequent covering of the seeds with adequate soil. In addition, the row marker (9) fitted on the adjustable arms with the help of clamps (10) extending from both sides of the supporting frame ensures maintaining desired distance of the rows - an essential requirement for proper growth.<br>
