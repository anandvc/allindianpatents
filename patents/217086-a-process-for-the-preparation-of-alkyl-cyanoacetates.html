				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of alkyl cyaooacetates, particularly in high purity and in good yield.<br>
Alkyl cyanoacetates are intermediates or precursors in the production of alpha cyanoacrylates monomers which polymerise rapidly and exhibit good adhesive properties. A few alkly cyanates, particularly methyl and ethyl cyanoacetates are used extensively in the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds, such as substituted pyridines and purine compounds.<br>
Conventional process for the manufacture of alkyl cyanoacetates consists of reacting cyanoacetic acid with an alcohol in the presence of p-toulenesulphonic acid and benzene. Azeotropic removal of water horn the reaction mixture resulted in the production of the desired alkyl cyanoacetate in about 95% yield. The reaction product in benzene was washed with water to remove unreacted cyanoacetic acid and the product was distilled under reduced pressure. The above process uses carcinogenic reactants which are expensive, hazardous to health and poses handling problems.<br>
In yet another known process, ethyl cyanoacetate is prepared by substituting the chlorine in chloroacetic acid with cyano group in the presence of acetonitrile or dimethyl sulphoxide as solvents followed by esterification. The chemicals used in this process also exhibit hazardous properties and are not cost effective.<br><br>
The object of this invention is to prepare alkyl cyanoacetates in a cost effective manner using chemicals which do not pose any health hazanls. Yet another object is to produce aikyl cyanoacetates having high purity and high yield compared to the existing processes.<br>
Alkyl cyanoacetates can be prepared by substituting the chlofo group in alky! chloroacetate by a cyano group. The chemical reaction for the preparation ofalkly cyanoacetate is represented by the following equation:<br>
CICH 2COOR + MCN -&gt; NCCH2COOR + MCI<br>
wherein R stands for an alkyl group having Ci to C12 carbon atoms and M is an alkali metal prefer^ly sodium or potassium.<br>
The improvement over the existing process is in carrying out the reaction in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst in a biphasic reaction medium. The reaction medium consists of water and a water immiscible organic solvent. Different water immiscible solvents such as dichloromethane, dichloroediane, tetrachloroethane, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and diethylether may be used. Reaction carried out in dichloromethane solvent medium is found to yield the best result. Any conventional phase transfer catalyst such as benzy triethylammonium bromide, benzyl triediylammonium   chloride,    tetra-n-butyl ammonium<br><br>
chloride, bromide and iodide, "18crown-6", tetraetfaytene glycol, polyethylene glycol 200 and 400, and "tween 20* are used in a molar concentration ranging from 1 to 10%. Out of these catalysts, benzyl tiietfayl ammonium chloride and bromide in 1% molar concentration is found appropriate in providing maximum yield and therefore preferred.<br>
Accordingly, this invention relates to a process for the preparation of an alkyl cyanoacetate which comprises reacting an alkyl chloroacetate with a metal cyanide in a biphasic reaction medium consisting of water and a water immiscible organic solvent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst and recovering the resulting alkyl cyanoacetate from the organic phase in a known manner.<br>
The reaction may be carried out at a temperature ranging from -10C to 80C depending upon the solvent used. The reaction mixture may be washed with water to remove the metal halide produced during the reaction. The organic phase may be distilled to recover alkyl cyanoacetate. Alkyl groups may be methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, hexyh heptyl, octyl, nonyl, dccyl, undecyl and dodecyl.<br>
The following non-limiting example describes the preparation of ethyl cyanoacetate.<br><br>
To a vigorously stirred solution of (1000 g, 8.16 mole) of 99% commercial grade ethyl chloroacetate and benzyl tri-ethylammonium chloride (22g. 0.0181 mole) in dichloromedane (1.75I)  taken in a five litre three necked flask fitted with a mechanical stirrer, condenser and an addition flask, sodium cyanide (480 g 9.8 mole) in distilled water (870 ml) was added drop by drop for a period of one hour. The mixture was stirred for about 3 hours after the completion of the addition of sodium cyanide for completing the reaction. 870 ml of distilled water was then added to the reaction mixture to dissolve the deposited sodium chloride. The aqeuous phase was separated and the organic phase was separately washed with distilled water before subjecting the same to distillation to remove the solvent dichloromethane and unreacted ethyl chloroacetate. Distillation was then continued and the fraction boiling at about 210\C was collected to yield 96% of ethyl cyanoacetate. Unreacted sodium cyanide foimd in the aqueous extract was detroyed by the addition of potassium permangante.<br>
Obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope of this invention.<br><br><br>
