				<td>A ZEOLITE CATALYST FOR SKELETAL ISOMERISATION OF OLEFINS<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an active zeolite catalyst having MTT structure and to<br>
a method for the manufacture of said catalyst. More particularly, the invention relates<br>
to a method for preparing the MTT structure whereby the synthesis is facilitated and<br>
reproducible, and the obtained product exhibits high catalytic utility. Said zeolite<br>
catalyst is particularly suitable for olefin isomerization reactions.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Molecular sieves are an important class of inorganic materials used in catalysis.<br>
Zeolites are an essential group of molecular sieves. Zeolites are crystalline<br>
aluminosilicates with a well-defined pore structure. The International Zeolite<br>
Association recognized 136 different groups of framework in January 2003. MTT is<br>
one of the structural groups of zeolites.<br>
Four types of zeolites having MTT structure are known in the art: ZSM-23, EU-13,<br>
IS1-4 and KZ-1. ZSM-23 zeolite has one-dimensional 10-ring channels. The unit cell<br>
of ZSM-23 can be represented as: Na+n [Aln Si 24-n O48] ~ 4H20, n 
dimensions of the channel system are 0.45 x 0.52 nm [1],<br>
In general, various zeolites are prepared using hydrothermal synthesis. In principal<br>
three major variables influence on the zeolite structure crystallised and said variables<br>
are the composition of the reaction mixture, the template and the time. For example,<br>
patents US 3 702 886 and US 3 926 782 describe the synthesis of MFI-structure<br>
based zeolite ZSM-5, US 4 481 177 describes the synthesis of TON structure based<br><br>
zeolite 2SM-22, and US 4 016 245 describes the synthesis of FER structure based<br>
zeolite ZSM-35.<br>
Several publications describe different factors, which are important in zeolite<br>
synthesis. Rollmann et al. teaches about the role of small amines in zeolite synthesis<br>
[2]. The synthesis of high-silica zeolites with one-directional medium pore systems,<br>
by using nitrogen-free templates has been studied by Giordan et al. [3]. Moini et al.<br>
[4] describe the role of diquatemary cations as directing agents in zeolite synthesis.<br>
The present inventors have studied in detail the effect of synthesis time and mode of<br>
stining on physicochemical and catalytic properties of ZSM- 5 zeolite catalysts [5].<br>
Several methods for preparation of MTT-structures are known. Patents US 4 076 842,<br>
US 4 104 151, GB 21 90910, GB 2 202 838, US 4 490 342, US 4531 012 and US 4<br>
619820 describe the synthesis of ZSM-23 from reaction mixtures containing different<br>
amines as structure directing agents or templates. International patent applications<br>
WO 96/29285 and WO 96/29286 provide methods for the production of medium pore<br>
zeolites, including ZSM-23, in the absence of any nitrogen-containing templating<br>
agent other than the small neutral amine. US 5 332 566 teaches the formation of<br>
ZSM-23 with a templating agent having the formula C14H36N33+. US 6 099 820<br>
discloses a method for making MTT zeolites without an organic template. EP 0 347<br>
273 provides a method for the manufacture of a MTT type zeolite using fluorine<br>
containing compounds in the synthesis mixture.<br>
Isomerization is a hydrocarbon transformation reaction and it is catalyzed by acid<br>
sites. In an isomerization reaction, the molecular formula of one substance does not<br>
change but its structure changes. Isomerization can be divided into several groups<br>
after the group of molecules that are isomerized (paraffin isomerization, olefin<br>
isomerization, etc.), or alternatively it can also be divided after the reaction type<br>
(skeletal isomerization, double-bond isomerization, etc.).<br><br>
The term "skeletal isomerization" stands here for a reaction wherein one n-olefin<br>
reacts to a corresponding isoolefin. This reaction is also known as olefin<br>
isomerization, hydrocarbon conversion, preparation of branched olefins, conversion<br>
of normal olefins to branched olefins and structural isomerization.<br>
Several patents describe skeletal isomerization of olefins with zeolite catalysts, For<br>
example, in patents EP 0574 994, EP 0 523 838, US 5 491 296, US 5 510 560, US 6<br>
323 384 and US 6 111 160 ferrierites are used in skeletal isomererization. ZSM-35<br>
has a similar type of zeolite structure as ferrierite and its use in skeletal isomerization<br>
is discussed in US 5 449 851 and WO 94/08920.<br>
Other potential catalysts for skeletal isomerization of olefins are catalysts based on<br>
TON structure like ZSM-22. In patents US 5 157 194, US 523 7121 and EP 0 5 49<br>
294 the use of ZSM-22 based catalysts in skeletal isomerization is described.<br>
MTT structure based catalysts, such as ZSM-23, are also used in skeletal<br>
isomerization of light olefins. In an example of US 5 243 090, HZSM-23 is used in n-<br>
butene conversion under a pressure of 720 kPa and. at temperatures between 551-554<br>
°C. The conversion of n-butene was 38 % with 84 % selectivity to isobutene. In US 5<br>
817 907, in examples 3 and 4, the uses of fresh and coked ZSM-23 catalysts in<br>
skeletal isomerization of n-butene are shown. The conversion of n-butene with the<br>
coked catalyst was 46 % with 40 % isobutene selectivity, and with the fresh catalyst,<br>
52 % with 20 % isobutene selectivity, respectively.<br>
Recently, a summary of the performance of different zeolite catalysts used in the<br>
skeletal isomerization has been presented [6]. It was found that ZSM-5, ZSM-22 and<br>
ZSM-23 are less adequate for butene skeletal isomerizarion than ferrierite, due to<br>
structural characteristics and a less suitable acidity (Table 1). All the studied zeolite<br><br>
catalysts showed a limited activity to isoolefins and a fast deactivation in the olefin<br>
skeletal isomerization reaction.<br>
Table 1. Microporous catalysts and their properties in butene skeletal<br>
isomerization [6]<br><br>
In the light of the state of the art it can be seen that there is an evident need for a<br>
highly active and selective zeolite catalyst, which can be used in olefin isomerization<br>
reactions.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a method for the manufacture of an active and<br>
selective zeolite catalyst having MTT structure.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to provide a novel, active and selective zeolite<br>
catalyst having MTT structure.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is the use of the active and selective zeolite catalyst<br>
having MTT structure, particularly in olefin isomerization reactions.<br>
Characteristic features of the method for the manufacture of the active and selective<br>
zeolite catalyst having MTT structure, of the active and selective zeolite catalyst<br>
having MTT structure, and the use of the active and selective zeolite catalyst having<br>
MTT structure are provided in the claims.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has now been found that the problems related to zeolite catalysts, which are used in<br>
olefin isomerization reactions, can be avoided or at least significantly decreased by<br>
the active and selective zeolite catalyst having MTT structure, prepared according to<br>
the invention.<br>
The MTT structure based catalyst comprises a carrier selected from alumina, silica or<br>
clay or any other carrier of the state of the art and possible combinations thereof. The<br>
amount of carrier varies between 10-90 wt-%, calculated on the total weight of the<br>
catalyst.<br>
The method for the manufacture of the novel zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	Preparation of a gel mixture using a gel ripening pre-treatment step at ambient<br>
temperature,<br>
b)	Hydrothermal synthesis in dynamic mode of stirring ("rotational" or "vigorous<br>
internal" stirring), and<br><br>
c) Removing of structure directing agent from the zeolite catalyst using a calcination<br>
procedure.<br>
The phase pure and highly crystalline zeolite catalysts having MTT structure, which<br>
are prepared according to the method of the invention, have superior selectivity and<br>
activity, particularly in skeletal isomerization of light olefins. Said catalysts provide<br>
essentially higher yields of isoolefins than the currently available catalysts according<br>
to the state of the art, presented in Table 1.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Without wishing to be restricted by the following explanations and theoretical<br>
considerations regarding the synthesis of the novel zeolite catalysts with MTT'<br>
structure, which are particularly suitable for olefin isomerization reactions, the<br>
essential features of the invention are discussed as follows.<br>
The method for the manufacture of a zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
comprises:<br>
a) Preparing of a gel mixture capable of forming crystalline material, and<br>
said mixture comprising a source(s) of alkali or alkaline earth metal (M)<br>
selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, a source(s) of an<br>
oxide of a trivalent element (X) selected from aluminium and gallium, a<br>
source(s) of an oxide of a tetravalent element (Y) selected from silicon<br>
and germanium, water and a directing agent (R) selected from compounds<br>
comprising organic nitrogen containing cations, preferably pyrrolidine and<br>
diethanolamme, and said mixture having a composition, in terms of molar<br>
ratios, within the following ranges of Table 2, wherein (O) is oxygen and<br>
(H) hydrogen;<br><br><br>
b)	Carrying out hydrothermal synthesis wherein said mixture from step a) is<br>
maintained under sufficient conditions including a temperature from about<br>
100 °C to about 250 °C under dynamic mode of stirring until crystals of said<br>
material are formed, recovering the material, and<br>
c)	Removing of said directing agent (R) partly or totally from the material<br>
obtained in step b) with a calcination procedure, whereby a zeolite catalyst<br>
having MTT structure is obtained.<br>
A typical X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of a zeolite catalyst with MTT structure<br>
according to the invention is presented in Figure 1. No other zeolite as an impurity<br>
was observed. The X-ray diffraction pattern was collected with Siemens Daco-MP<br>
Kristalloflex instrument. The sample holder was mads of PVC.<br>
Figure 2, a scanning electron micrograph of a zeolite catalyst with MTT structure<br>
according to the invention, shows that the zeolite catalyst comprises small rod shaped<br>
crystals.<br><br>
The method for the manufacture of the zeolite catalyst having MTT structure,<br>
preferably comprises the following steps:<br>
a)	Preparation of the gel mixture using a gel ripening pre-treatment step at<br>
ambient temperature,<br>
b)	Carrying out the hydrothermal synthesis in dynamic mode of stirring<br>
("rotational" or "vigorous internal" stirring), and<br>
c)	Removing of the structure directing agent (R) partly or totally from the zeolite<br>
catalyst using a calcination procedure.<br>
The steps a), b) and c) are described in detail in the following:<br>
Step a): The preparation of a gel mixture using a gel ripening pre-treatment step is<br>
carried out as follows: Solution A is prepared by adding a source(s) of an oxide of an<br>
alkali or alkaline earth metal selected from sodium, potassium, magnesium and<br>
calcium, preferably sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or sodium carbonate, to<br>
water, preferably ion exchanged or distilled water, and the obtained solution is stirred.<br>
A source(s) of an oxide of a tetravalent element selected from silicon and germanium,<br>
preferably colloidal silica, solid silica, fumed silica or silica hydroxide, is added to<br>
the above described Solution A with continuous stirring. After the addition of the<br>
oxide of the tetravalent element, the mixture is further stirred. This obtained mixture<br>
is denoted as Solution B.<br>
Solution C is prepared by adding a source(s) of an oxide of a trivalent element<br>
selected from aluminium and gallium, preferably aluminium sulphate<br>
(A12(S04)3.18H2O), hydrated aluminium hydroxides, aluminates, aluminium<br><br>
isoproxide and alumina, to water, preferably deiordzed or distilled water, and the<br>
mixture is further stirred. To this mixture, a directing agent (R) selected from<br>
compounds comprising organic nitrogen containing cations, preferably pyrrolidine or<br>
diethanolamine, is added, preferably dropwise, with vigorous stirring. After the<br>
addition of the directing agent, the mixture is further stirred.<br>
Solution C is added to Solution B slowly. After the addition of Solution C to Solution<br>
B, the obtained gel mixture is further stirred (gel ripening). To this gei mixture<br>
sulphuric acid is added slowly, keeping pH in an alkaline range, preferably in the<br>
range of 8.5-13.5. The gel mixture is further stirred (gel ripening).<br>
The use of gel ripening (gel ageing) provides nuclei necessary for the synthesis of<br>
comparatively uniform shape, size and distribution of the crystals of the zeolite<br>
having MTT structure. Gel ripening may also shorten the synthesis time (i.e. it can<br>
accelerate the crystallization process). Further, it may influence the yield of the<br>
zeolite with MTT structure and influence the Si/Al ratio.<br>
Step b): The hydrothermal synthesis in dynamic mode of stirring ("rotational" or<br>
"vigorous internal" stirring) is carried out as follows: The gel mixture prepared in<br>
step a) is charged into a reactor, which is optionally pressurized to a pressure between<br>
02-5 Mpa. The strirring is started and the temperature of the reactor is raised to a<br>
temperature suitable for the crystallization, preferably to 100-250 °C and particularly<br>
preferably to 120-220 °C. The synthesis is carried out in a dynamic mode. The<br>
hydrothermal synthesis can be carried out in a heatable, stirred tank reactor, in a loop<br>
reactor, in an ebuuated reactor or in any other reactor suitable for solid-liquid phase<br>
reactions known in the state of the art.<br><br>
After the completion of the synthesis, the temperature of the reactor is decreased<br>
rapidly. The product is isolated, washed with water, preferably deionised or distilled<br>
water, and dried.<br>
The hydrothermal synthesis is carried out in a dynamic mode (i.e. rotation or<br>
vigorous internal stirring during synthesis). This mode of stirring is known from the<br>
state of the art to influence phase purity and size of crystals of aluminosilicate type of<br>
zeolites, and if static mode i.e. without stirring is used, larger crystals are obtained<br>
when compared with preparation under continuous stirring. The use of dynamic mode<br>
of stirring in the synthesis of the zeolite with MTT structure results in zeolitic<br>
material with high crystallinity, phase purity and crystals with regular size.<br>
Step c): Removal of the structure directing agent from the zeolite catalyst is carried<br>
out using a calcination procedure as follows:<br>
The calcination procedure is performed by raising the temperature of an oven or other<br>
suitable heatable equipment containing the zeolite obtained from step b) with a slow<br>
heating rate, preferably 0.05-2 °C/min to a temperature of 400-600 °C. Preferably a<br>
slow heating rate is applied to reach an intermediate temperature of 200-400 °C,<br>
which is then followed by raising the temperature to the final calcination temperature<br>
of 400-600 °C.<br>
The removal of the structure directing agent i.e. the organic template, is carried out by<br>
the calcination procedure. The removal of the stiructure directing agent after the<br>
completion of the synthesis of the zeolite catalyst is an important step in order to free<br>
its pores of organic compounds to obtain high surface area. Temperature, heating rate,<br>
duration of calcinations and presence of carrier gas during organic template removal<br><br>
from MTT structure may influence surface area, pore systems, location of framework<br>
alumina and formation of extraframework alumina.<br>
The method optionally comprises replacing ions of the crystalline material, at least in<br>
part, by ion exchange with an ion or a mixture of ions selected from the group<br>
consisting of hydrogen and hydrogen precursors or metals.<br>
The zeolite catalyst having MTT structure contains a carrier selected from alumina,<br>
silica or clay or any other carrier of the state of the art and possible combinations<br>
thereof. The amount of the carrier varies between 10-90 wt-%, calculated on the<br>
amount of the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst can be formulated with techniques known in the art, such as spray<br>
drying, extrusion and the like.<br>
The zeolite catalyst having MTT structure according to the invention can be modified<br>
using any conventional methods known in the art. Examples of such methods are<br>
calcination procedures, ion exchange procedures, impregnation procedures and<br>
various other treatments known in the art.<br>
The different steps in the manufacture of the catalyst according to the invention can<br>
be performed in any suitable equipment generally known in the art.<br>
The novel zeolite catalysts having MTT structure showed surprisingly high activities<br>
and selectivities, particularly in skeletal isomerization of light olefins. Additionally,<br>
no deactivation was observed in conditions where commercial catalysts were rapidly<br>
deactivated, as can be seen from Example 9.<br><br>
The zeolite catalyst having MTT structure may be used in skeletal isotnerization<br>
processes of olefins, suitably in fixed bed reactors and in fluidised bed reactors. In the<br>
process, a feed containing at least one group of olefins having 4 to 20, preferably<br>
from 4 to 10 carbon atoms, is brought into contact with the catalyst at a temperature<br>
between 50 oC and 500 °C, depending on the olefin which is isomerized, and under a<br>
pressure between 0.01 and 5 MPa. Particularly suitable feed comprises C4, C5, C6 or<br>
C7 oleEnic hydrocarbons, or mixtures thereof, preferably G4, C5 or C6 olefmic<br>
hydrocarbons.<br>
The isomerization process can be carried out in a packed bed reactor, a fixed bed<br>
reactor, fluidized bed reactor or a moving bed reactor. Especially preferred reactor<br>
system is described in FI patent 101156 and patent application FI 20002783, the<br><br>
contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The invention is illustrated in detail with the following examples. However, the scope<br>
of the invention is not meant to be limited to the examples.<br>
Examples<br>
 Example 1<br>
Preparation of a zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
Step a): Solution A was prepared by adding 8.9 g of sodium hydroxide to 392 g of<br>
distilled water and stirred. 33.5 g of fumed silica was added to Solution A with<br>
continuous stirring. After the addition of the fumed silica, the solution was further<br>
stirred. This mixture was denoted as Solution B. Solution C was prepared by adding<br>
3.9 g of aluminium sulphate ((Al2(SO4)3.18H2O) to 49.2 g of distilled water and the<br>
mixture was further stirred. To this mixture, 17.9 g of pyrrolidine was added<br><br>
dropwise with vigorous stirring speed. After the addition of pyrrolidine, the mixture<br>
was further stirred.<br>
Solution C was added slowly to Solution B. After the addition of Solution C to<br>
Solution B, the gel mixture was further stirred (gel ripening). To this gel mixture 8.0<br>
g of sulphuric acid was added slowly. The prepared gel mixture was further stirred<br>
{gel ripening).<br>
Step b): The prepared gel mixture was put in two teflon cups inserted in 300 ml steel<br>
autoclaves. The autoclaves were mounted over a shaft in an oven and the temperature<br>
of the oven was raised to 180 °C. The synthesis was carried out in dynamic mode for<br>
48 hours at 180 °C. After the completion of the synthesis the autoclaves were<br>
quenched. The product was mixed with distilled water, filtered and washed with on-<br>
line flowing distilled water. The product was left to dry over a filter paper. The<br>
crystalline product was separated from the filter paper and dried over a ceramic dish<br>
in an oven with airflow. The temperature and time of drying were 110 °C for 12 h,<br>
respectively.<br>
Step c): The calcination procedure was performed stepwise by raising the temperature<br>
of the muffle oven containing the zeolite sample (slow heating rate) to an<br>
intermediate temperature. The calcination was carried out at the intermediate<br>
temperature for an interval of time, followed by raising the temperature (slow heating<br>
rate) to the final calcination temperature below 600 °C where the zeolite was<br>
calcined.<br>
The properties of the obtained product were the following: The Si/Al-ratio was 42,<br>
the amount of Bronsted acid sites was 90 μmol/g, the sodium content was 0.1 wt-%,<br><br>
the carbon content was 0.7 wt-% and the BET-surfaoe area was 110 m2/g. The XRD-<br>
diffraction pattern is given in Table 3.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Ion-exchange procedure<br>
The sodium form of the zeolite catalyst having MTT structure, obtained from<br>
example 1, was transformed to proton form by repeated ion-exchange method using<br>
aqueous solutions of ammonium chloride. After the ion-exchange procedure, the<br>
ammonium form of the zeolite was washed thoroughly with distilled water. The<br>
ammonium form of the zeolite was dried at 100 °C for 10 h and it was transformed<br>
into proton form using the stepwise calcination procedure. The properties of the<br>
obtained product (New catalyst A) were the following: The SiA1-ratio was 42, the<br>
amount of Bronsted acid sites was 170 μmol/g and the sodium content was 92 ppm.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of a zeolite catalyst having MTT etructure<br>
Step a): Solution A was prepared by adding 8.9 g of sodium hydroxide to 392 g of<br>
distilled water and the mixture was stirred. 33.5 g of filmed silica was added to<br>
Solution A with continuous stirring. After the addition of fumed silica, the solution<br>
was former stirred. This mixture was denoted as Solution B. Solution C was prepared<br>
by adding 3.9 g of aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3.18H2O) to 49.2 g of distilled water<br>
and the mixture was further stirred. To this mixture, 17.9 g of pyrrolidine was added<br>
dropwise with vigorous stirring speed. After the addition of pyrrolidine, the mixture<br>
was further stirred.<br>
Solution C was added slowly to Solution B. After the addition of Solution C to<br>
Solution B, the gel mixture was further stirred (gel ripening). To this gel mixture 8.0<br>
g of sulphuric acid was added slowly. The prepared, gel mixture was further stirred<br>
(gel ripening).<br>
Step b): The prepared gel mixture was put in two teflon cups inserted in 300 ml steel<br>
autoclaves. The autoclaves were mounted over a shaft in an oven and the temperature<br>
of the oven was raised to 180 °C. The synthesis was carried out in dynamic mode at<br>
180°C for 24h.<br>
After the completion of the synthesis, the autoclaves were quenched. The product was<br>
mixed with distilled water, filtered and washed with on-line flowing distilled water.<br>
The product was left to dry over a filter paper. The crystalline product was separated<br>
from the filter paper and dried over a ceramic dish in an oven with airflow. The<br>
temperature and time of drying were 110 °C for 12 h, respectively.<br><br>
Step c): The calcination procedure was performed stepwise by raising the temperature<br>
of the muffle oven containing the zeolite sample (slow heating rate) to an<br>
intermediate temperature. The calcination was carried out at the intermediate<br>
temperature for an interval of time, followed by raising the temperature (slow heating<br>
rate) to the final calcination temperature below 600 °C where the zeolite was<br>
calcined.<br>
Example 4<br>
Ion-exchange procedure<br>
The sodium form of the zeolite catalyst having MTT structure, obtained from<br>
example 3, was transformed to proton form by a repeated ion-exchange method using<br>
aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate. After the ion-exchange procedure, the<br>
ammonium form of the zeolite was washed thoroughly with distilled water. The<br>
ammonium form of zeolite was dried at 100 °C for 10 h and it was transformed into<br>
proton form by calcination.<br>
Example 5<br>
Preparation of a zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
Step a): Solution A was prepared by adding 8.9 g of sodium hydroxide to 392 g of<br>
distilled water and the mixture was stirred 33.5 g of fumed silica was added to<br>
Solution A with continuous stirring. After the addition of fumed silica, the solution<br>
was further stirred. This mixture was denoted as Solution B. Solution C was prepared<br>
by adding 3.9 g of aluminium sulphate (Al2(SO4)3.18H2O) to 49.2 g of distilled water<br>
and the mixture was further stirred. To this mixture, 17.9 g of pyrrolidine was added<br>
with vigorous stirring speed. After the addition of pyrrolidine, the mixture was further<br>
stirred.<br><br>
Solution C was added to Solution B slowly. After the addition of the Solution C to<br>
Solution B, the gel mixture was further stirred (gel ripening). To this gel mixture 8.0<br>
g of sulphuric acid was added slowly. The prepared gel mixture was further stirred<br>
(gel ripening).<br>
Step b): The prepared gel mixture was put in two teflon cups inserted in 300 ml steel<br>
autoclaves. The autoclaves were mounted over a shaft in an oven and the temperature<br>
of the oven was raised to 180 °C. The synthesis was tarried out in dynamic mode at<br>
180 °C for 96 h. After the completion of the synthesis, the autoclaves were quenched.<br>
The product was mixed with distilled water, filtered and washed with on-line flowing<br>
distilled water. The product was left to dry over a filter paper. The crystalline product<br>
was separated from the filter paper and dried over a ceramic dish in an oven with<br>
airflow. The temperature and time of drying were 110 oC for 12 h, respectively.<br>
Step c): The step calcination procedure was performed by raising the temperature of<br>
the muffle oven containing the zeolite sample (slow heating rate) to an intermediate<br>
temperature. The calcination was carried out at the intermediate temperature for an<br>
interval of time, followed by raising the temperature (slow heating rate) to the final<br>
calcination temperature below 600 °C where the zeolite was calcinated. The stepwise<br>
calcination procedure of the zeolite catalyst with MTT structure resulted in the<br>
removal of the organic template.<br>

distilled water and the mixture was stirred. 33.5 g of fumed silica was added to<br>
Solution A with a continuous stirring. After the addition of fumed silica, it was<br>
further stirred. This mixture is denoted as Solution B. Solution C was prepared by<br>
adding 3.9 g of aluminium sulphate (A12(SO4)3.18H2O) to 49.2 g of distilled water<br>
and the mixture was further stirred. To this mixture, 17.9 g of pyrrolidine was added<br>
dropwise with vigorous stirring speed. After the addition of pyrrolidine the mixture<br>
was further stirred.<br>
Solution C was slowly added to Solution B. After the addition of Solution C to<br>
Solution B the gel mixture was farther stirred (gel ripening). To this gel mixture 8.0 g<br>
of sulphuric acid was added slowly. The prepared gel. mixture was further stirred, (gel<br>
ripening).<br>
Step b): The prepared gel mixture was put in a teflon cup inserted in a 300 ml steel<br>
autoclave. The autoclave was mounted over a shaft in an oven and the temperature of<br>
the oven was raised to 180 °C. The synthesis was carried out under vigorous stirring<br>
 for 48 hours at 180 °C.<br>
After completion of the synthesis, the autoclave was quenched. The product was<br>
mixed with distilled water, filtered and washed with on-line flowing distilled water.<br><br>
The sample was left to dry over a filter paper. The crystalline product was separated<br>
from the filter paper and dried over a ceramic dish in an oven with airflow. The<br>
temperature and time of drying was 110 °C for 12 h, respectively. The product was<br>
calcinated for template removal.<br>
Example 8<br>
Ion-exchange procedure<br>
The sodium form of the zeolite catalyst having MTI structure from example 7 was<br>
transformed to proton form by repeated ion-exchange method using aqueous<br>
solutions of ammonium nitrate. After the ion-exchange, the ammonium form of<br>
zeolite was washed thoroughly with distilled water. The ammonium form of zeolite<br>
was dried at 100 °C for 10 h and transformed into proton form by calcination. The<br>
obtained product was denoted "New catalyst B".<br>
Example 9<br>
Skeletal isomerization with a zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
A catalyst having a MTT structure (ZSM-23) was prepared according to the method<br>
described in Example 2 (New catalyst A). The activity was compared to those of the<br>
ferrierite type and ZSM-22 type catalysts in a fixed bed microreactor. Ferrierite A<br>
was a ferrierite catalyst without any carrier, ferrierite B was a ferrierite catalyst with<br>
alumina carrier and ferrierite C was a ferrierite catalyst with clay carrier. The feed<br>
contained 40 wt-% of n-hexane and 60 wt-% of n-hexenes. The tests were made at<br>
225 °C, 1 bar and with weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 20 1/h. Total run<br>
times were 48 hours. The yield of isohexenes (conversion of n-hexenes x selectivity<br>
to isohexenes) was determined from on-line GC-analysis of product samples.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows the yields obtained with different catalysts as a function of time on<br>
stream. The yield of isohexenes was noticeably higher with the catalyst according to<br>
the invention having the MTT-structure than with ferrierite or ZSM-22 catalysts. In<br>
addition, no deactivation was observed with the catalyst of the invention.<br>
Example 10<br>
Skeletal isomerkation with a zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
The activity of a catalyst having a MTT structure, prepared according to the method<br>
described in Example 8 (New catalyst B), was compared to that of the ferrierite<br>
catalyst A with n-pentene feed. n-Pentenes were diluted with 50 wt-% n-pentane. The<br>
catalysts were tested in a microreactor at 225 °C, 1 bar and with WHSV of 40 h"1.<br>
Table 4 shows that the yield of isopentenes was higher with ZSM-23 (New catalyst<br>
B) than with the commercial ferrierite A after 25 hours on stream. The conversion of<br>
n-pentenes was noticeably higher with ZSM-23 (New catalyst B) than with the<br>
ferrierite A. The lower selectivity to isopentenes with the New catalyst B was related<br>
to the higher conversion level obtained.<br>
Table 4. The activities with New catalyst B and with commercial ferrierite A after 25<br>
hours on stream<br><br><br>
Example 11<br>
Skeletal isomerization of 1-butene with a zeolite catalyst having MTT structure<br>
The activity of a catalyst having MTT-structure (New catalyst A), prepared according<br>
to Example 2, was tested in skeletal isomerization of 1-butene at 400 °C and under<br>
atmospheric pressure. The activity was compared to that of commercial ferrierite A<br>
and ZSM-22. n-Butene feed with WHSV of 44 h-1 was used. The results in Table 5<br>
show that at similar conversion level, the selectivity to isobutene was higher with the<br>
New catalyst A than with other catalysts.<br>
Table 5. The selectivity to isobutene with the new catalyst A, with commercial<br>
ferrierite A and with ZSM-22<br><br>
Example 12<br>
Skeletal isomerization of n-hexenes<br>
The activity of the catalyst prepared according to Example 8 (New catalyst B) was<br>
tested in skeletal isomerization of n-hexenes at 225 °C and 1 bar. In addition, the<br>
catalyst from Example 7 was calcined the same way as the catalyst in Example 8, but<br>
no ion-exchange was performed. This yielded New catalyst C. The activity of the<br>
New catalyst C was similar to that of the New catalyst B (Figure 4). Ion exchange<br>
 was, thus, not needed for the catalyst to be active under the used conditions.<br><br>
Example 13 (Comparative example)<br>
Skeletal isomerization of hezene with a SSM-23 zeolite catalyst<br>
A ZSM-23 catalyst was prepared as instructed in US 4 076 842. The activity of the<br>
ZSM-23 catalyst was studied in a fixed bed reactor. The test conditions were exactly<br>
the same as in Example 9. The obtained conversion of n-hexene was significantly<br>
low, being 1 wt-% or even lower.<br><br>
