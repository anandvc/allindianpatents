The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed. A1<br>
1<br><br>
This invention pertains to A3 and A1 adenosine receptor agonists, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such agonists, and a method of use thereof, for example, in treating various medical disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Extracellular adenosine acts as a local modulator at four subtypes of adenosine receptors, namely, A1, A2A, A2B, and A3, which are involved in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. Fredholm et al., Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53:527-52. For example, adenosine attenuates the effects of ischemia in the heart and brain. Acting through the A2A adenosine receptor, it suppresses prolonged inflammation; Ohta et al., Nature 2001; 4/4:916-920; and causes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation, thus increasing the amount of oxygen available to an organ under stress.   Adenosine agonists selective for the A3 adenosine receptor are of interest as cerebroprotective, cardioprotective, and anticancer agents, von Lubitz et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1994, 263:59-67; Liu et al., Cardiovasc Res., 1994, 25:1057-61; Strickler etal.,7. Clin. Invest., 1996, 95:1773-9; Fishman et al., Oncogene, 2004, 25:2465-71. It is believed that A3 -selective compounds will have utility in the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of cardiac disease, infertility, kidney disease, and central nervous system (CNS) disorders.<br>
The potential utility of A1 and A2 -selective agents in therapeutic applications has been limited by accompanying side effects, given the ubiquitous nature of the Ai<br>
and A2 receptors. The distribution of the A3 adenosine receptor, by contrast, is fairly limited, being found primarily in the CNS, brain, testes, and immune system, where it appears to be involved in the modulation of release from mast cells of mediators of the immediate hypersensitivity reaction (Ramkumar et al., J. Biol. Chem., 268, 16887-16890 (1993)). The limited distribution of the A3 adenosine receptor provides a basis for predicting that A3 -selective compounds may be more useful than Ap and A2-selective compounds as potential therapeutic agents.<br>
2<br><br>
Accordingly, there is a great interest for finding A3 adenosine receptor agonists, as shown by the patenting activity in this area; see, for example, U.S. Patents 5,773,423 and 5,688,774; and U.S. Published Patent Application No. 2003/0216412 Al. Therefore, there is a great need for A3 adenosine receptor agonists, especially those that are selective to A3 adenosine receptor over the A1 and A2 adenosine receptors. There further exists a need for compounds that activate both A3 and A1 receptors.<br>
The invention provides such adenosine receptor agonists. The advantages of the invention, as well as additional inventive features, will be apparent from the description of the invention provided herein.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides A3 selective agonists, particularly N-methanocarba adenine nucleosides, for example, with selected substituents at the 2, N6, 2', 3', 4', and 5'- positions, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such nucleosides, and methods of use thereof, for example, in a method for selectively activating an A3 adenosine receptor of a mammal comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a nucleoside of the invention.<br>
The invention also provides dual acting A3 and A1 receptor agonists for use in cardioprotection, e.g., in a method of treating patients suffering from ischemia damage or at risk for the same.<br>

For A1(squares) and A2 (diamonds) adenosine receptors, the observed values fall on the predicted solid lines; for the A3 (triangles), the observed Ki values fall below the predicted line, thereby indicating that the of A3 selectivity is surprisingly enhanced by the inclusion of the constrained 9-position substituent relative to the selectivity to A1 and A2 adenosine receptors.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is predicated on the concept that adenine nucleoside analogues having a ring constraint provide enhanced binding affinity and improved selectivity to A3 adenosine receptors. The analogues contain the (N)-methanocarba (bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) ring system, which is a rigid ribose substitute lacking the ether oxygen.<br>

12<br><br>
carbohydrate chiral synthon and (2) a key acid-catalyzed isomerization of an isopropylidene group. See also Figures 1-6. The substituents R1-R6 can be introduced or incorporated into the molecule by any suitable method; see, for example, U.S. Patents 5,773,423 and 5,688,774 and U.S. Published Application No. 2003/0216412 Al.<br>
Further, Can. J. Chem., 1970, 48, 570 discloses a method to convert a cyclic ketone to aminocycloalkane by transamination, and Hughes, D. L., Org.

The alcohol is treated with triphenylphosphine, diethyl azodicarboxylate and usually, phthalimide, followed by hydrazinolysis. These methods can be used to introduce a 3'-amino group in the compounds of the present invention. Pyrazolyl groups can be introduced into the 2-position of the adenine ring by the methods shown in Elzein et al., J. Med. Chem., 2004, 47, 4766-4773.<br>

The present invention provides a method of selectively activating A3 adenosine receptors in a mammal, which method comprises administering to a mammal in need of selective activation of its A3 adenosine receptors a therapeutically effective amount, including a prophylactically effective amount, of a compound which binds with the A3 receptor so as to stimulate an A3 receptor-dependent response. The compound can be administered acutely or chronically.<br>
The method of the present invention has particular usefulness in in vivo applications. For example, A3 adenosine receptor agonists can be used in the treatment of any disease state or condition involving the release of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3), diacylglycerol (DAG), and free radicals and subsequent arachidonic acid cascades. Thus, high blood pressure, locomotor hyperactivity, hypertension, acute hypoxia, depression, and infertility can be treated in accordance with the present inventive method, wherein one of the above-described compounds is acutely administered, e.g., within about a few minutes to about an hour of the onset or realization of symptoms. The method also has utility in the treatment of chronic disease states and conditions, in particular those conditions and disease states wherein chronic prophylactic or therapeutic administration of one of the above-described compounds will prevent the onset of symptoms or will reduce recovery time. Examples of disease states and conditions that may be chronically treated in accordance with the present inventive method include inflammatory disorders, such as vascular inflammation and arthritis, allergies, asthma, wound healing, stroke, cardiac failure, acute spinal cord injury, acute head injury or trauma, seizure, neonatal hypoxia (cerebral palsy; prophylactic treatment involves chronic exposure through placental circulation), chronic hypoxia due to arteriovenous malformations and occlusive cerebral artery disease, severe neurological disorders related to excitotoxicity, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's<br>
16<br><br>
chorea, and other diseases of the CNS, cardiac disease, kidney disease, and contraception.<br>
These compounds of the invention can be significant cerebral protectants. As such, the above compounds can be used to treat and/or protect against a variety of disorders, including, for example, seizures, transient ischemic shock, strokes, focal ischemia originating from thrombus or cerebral hemorrhage, global ischemia originating from cardiac arrest, trauma, neonatal palsy, hypovolemic shock, and hyperglycemia and associated neuropathies.<br>
The above method of treatment is applicable, for example, where a mammal has or is at risk of having a condition, disorder, or disease state associated with the cellular release of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate or diacylglycerol. The method is also applicable when the mammal has or is at risk for hyperactivity and the compound in binding to the A3 adenosine receptors functions as a locomotor depressant.<br>
The present inventive method is also applicable when the mammal has or is at risk for hypertension and the compound in binding to the A3 adenosine receptors functions as a hypotensive agent. The method is also applicable when the mammal has or is at risk for anxiety and the compound in binding to the A3 adenosine receptors functions as an anxiolytic agent. The method is furthermore applicable when the mammal has or is at risk for cerebral ischemia and the compound in binding to the A3 adenosine receptors functions as a cerebroprotectant. The method is also applicable when the mammal has or is at risk for seizures and the compound in binding to the A3 adenosine receptors functions as an antiseizure agent.<br>
The present inventive method can be administered chronically as well as acutely. The present inventive method includes the administration to an animal, such as a mammal, particularly a human, in need of the desired A3 receptor-dependent response of an effective amount, e.g., a therapeutically effective amount, of one or more of the aforementioned present inventive compounds or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or derivatives thereof, alone or in combination with one or more other pharmaceutically active compounds.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention provides a method for activating A3 and A1 adenosine receptors in a mammal comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound that has affinity for both the receptors. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of cardioprotecting a patient in need thereof comprising administering to the patient an agonist having affinity for both the A1 and A3 adenosine receptors in an effective amount of a compound to activate the A1 and A3 adenosine receptors in the heart of said patient. Cardioprotecting comprises preventing or reducing ischemic damage to the heart.<br>

One skilled in the art will appreciate that suitable methods of administering a compound of the present invention to an animal are available, and, although more than one route can be used to administer a particular compound, a particular route can provide a more immediate and more effective reaction than another route. Accordingly, the above-described methods are merely exemplary and are in no way limiting.<br>
The dose administered to an animal, particularly a human, in the context of the present invention should be sufficient to effect a prophylactic or other therapeutic response in the animal over a reasonable time frame. One skilled in the art will recognize that dosage will depend upon a variety of factors including the strength of the particular compound employed, the age, species, condition, and body weight of the animal, as well as the severity/stage of the disease or condition. The size of the dose will also be determined by the route, timing and frequency of administration as well as the existence, nature, and extent of any adverse side-effects that might accompany the administration of a particular compound and the desired physiological effect. It will be appreciated by one of skill in the art that various conditions or disease states, in particular chronic conditions or disease states, may require prolonged treatment involving multiple administrations.<br>
Suitable doses and dosage regimens can be determined by conventional range-finding techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Generally, treatment is initiated with smaller dosages, which are less than the optimum dose of the compound. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. For convenience, the total daily dosage may be divided and administered in portions during the day if desired. In proper doses and with suitable administration of certain compounds, the present invention provides for a wide range of selective A3 adenosine receptor-dependent responses, as well as A3 and A1 adenosine receptor dependent responses. Exemplary dosages range from about 0.01 to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the animal being treated/day. Preferred dosages range from about 0.1 to about 10 mg/kg body weight/day.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for activating an A3 adenosine receptor, or both A3 and A1, adenosine receptors, in a cell comprising contacting the cell with a compound of the invention. The contacting can take place in vivo or in vitro.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention but, of course, should not be construed as in any way limiting its scope.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
This example demonstrates a method of preparing some of the compounds in accordance with embodiments of the invention.<br>
The synthesis shown in Figure 1 started with commercially available 2,3-0-isopropylidene-D-erythronolactone (105), which was reduced with DIBAL-H to provide 2,3-0-isopropylidene-D-ervthrose (106) according to published methods. Gaoet al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1983,105, 3661-3672. This lactol underwent Wittig olefination with the corresponding methylenetriphenylphosphine ylid to afford the ring-opened alcohol 107 in 60% yield. At this stage, a Swern oxidation protocol was chosen among several methods tested to oxidize 107 to the corresponding aldehyde 108. The resulting aldehyde was found to be unstable and therefore it was utilized immediately for the next reaction. Oxidation of the aldehyde to the acid 109 with sodium chlorite, followed by Dieckmann condensation of the activated acid with ethyl 2-lithioacetate, afforded the desired (3-ketoester 110 (59%) plus an unwanted epimerized derivative 111 (9%) as a mixture of separable diastereoisomers. This epimerization problem was surmounted by treating aldehyde 4a directly with ethyl diazoacetate in the presence of tin (II) chloride to provide the keto ester 110 as the sole product in 36% overall yield from alcohol 107. Using a standard protocol, the unsaturated keto ester 110 was converted to the diazo compound 112, which underwent a thermally-induced intramolecular cyclopropanation to give the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexan-2-one derivatives 113 and 114 in a combined 48% yield with a favorable diastereoisomeric ratio (3:1) for the desired isomer 113. The bicyclo derivative 113 was isolated chromatographically and reduced stereospecifically with NaBFMo give alcohol 115 as a single product in 72% yield. The structure of 115 was confirmed by X-ray analysis, which unambiguously validated the suitability of our synthetic approach to construct (N)-methanocarba carbocyclic nucleosides.<br>
The nucleobase coupling was carried out via a Mitsunobu reaction (Figure 2). Accordingly, alcohol 115 was subjected to an acid-catalyzed equilibration to produce the isomeric acetonide 116, which was isolated in 90% yield (based on recovery of alcohol 115) by careful crystallization from cyclohexane. The requisite alcohol 116 when subjected to a Mitsunobu coupling reaction with 2,6-dichloropurine afforded the condensed product 117 in 36% yield. Treatment of 117<br>
with excess of CH3NH2 followed by deprotection of the acetonide group afforded authentic (N)-methanocarba nucleoside 14 (MRS 2346), whose spectral properties matched those reported in the literature. Lee et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001,7/, 1333-1337. In addition, reaction of 117 with 3-iodobenzylamine in the presence of Et3N, followed by reaction with excess of CH3NH2, provided compound 119.   Removal of the acetonide by standard methods produced the other target 5 (MRS<br>
19<br><br>
1898) in 74% yield. The spectral properties of 5 matched those of the identical compound reported in the literature. Lee et al. supra. To demonstrate the generality of this route, other novel N6-substituted (N)-methanocarba nucleosides, e.g., 33 and 34, were prepared in reasonable yields.<br>
Synthetic reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI). 1H-NMR spectra were obtained with a Varian Gemini-300 spectrometer (300 MHz) with D20, CDCl3, CD3OD, and DMSO-d6 as solvents. Low-resolution mass spectra were measured with a Finnigan-Thermoquest LCQ with APCI (Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization) interface. Low-resolution and high-resolution FAB (fast atom bombardment) mass spectrometry was performed with a JEOL SX102 spectrometer with 6-kV Xe atoms following desorption from a glycerol matrix.<br>
2,3-O-Isopropylidene-D-erythrose (106) was prepared from commercially available 2,3-O-isopropylidene-D-erythronolactone (105) by the procedure of Cohen et ai. (J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1983, 105, 3661-3672) in 90% yield.<br>
(4R,5S)-(2,2-Dimethyl-5-vinyl-l,3-dioxolan-4-yl)methan-l-ol (107). To a solution containing methylrriphenyl phosphonium bromide (7.85 g, 22 mmol) in dry THF (60 mL) was added potassium tert-butoxide (2.2 g, 20.0 mmol). The resulting reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 1 h under nitrogen. The lactol 36b (1.60 g, 10 mmol) in dry THF (20 ml) was added at -78 °C, and the reaction was allowed to reach room temperature. After stirring for an additional 3 h, it was treated with saturated brine (100 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried (Na2SO4) and concentrated. Purification by column chromatography (silica gel; EtOAc:hexanes, 25:75) gave 107 (0.94 g, 60%) as an oil; [α]D25 +41.2 (c 2.5 CHCl3) [Rao et al.,7. Carbohydr. Chem. 1996, 15, 975-984] [α]D25 +40.1] with identical spectral properties as reported in Rao et al.<br>
Ethyl (45,55)-3-[2,2-dimethyl-5-vinyl(l,3-dioxolan-4-yl)]-3-oxopropanoate 110. Method A. From compound 107, the acid 109 was prepared according to the work of Rao et al., supra. A stirred solution of 109 (0.35 g, 2.03 mmol) in THF (3 mL) maintained 0 °C was treated with l,l'-carbonyldiimidazole (0.43 mg, 2.64 mmol). After 30 min, the temperature was raised to 30 °C and additional stirring continued for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, this solution was added via cannula to a -78 °C solution of LiCH2CO2CH2CH3 obtained from EtOAc (0.6 mL, 6.14 mmol) and LDA (0.48 g, 6.1 mmol) in anhydrous THF (5 mL) during 1.5 h at -78 °C.   The reaction was quenched at the same temperature with 1N HCl (6.1 mL), stirred further at -78 °C for 10 min, allowed to warm up to 0 °C, adjusted to pH 3, and extracted with EtOAc (80<br>
20 <br>
mL). The combined organic extract was washed with brine, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (hexanes:EtOAc, 7:1) to give the desired β-keto ester 110 (0.293 g, 59%) as a clear oil. A small amount of the (4R,5S)-isomer 111(0.038 g, 8%) was also obtained as a clear oil.<br>

Method B. A solution of dry DMSO (1.75 g, 22.4 mmol) in dry CH2Cl2 (20<br>
mL) was added to a solution of (COCl)2 (1.52 g, 12 mmol) in dry CH2C12 (40 mL), which had been cooled to -78 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere. The resulting reaction mixture was further stirred at the same temperature for another 15 min before a solution of alcohol 107 (1.27 g, 8 mmol) in dry CH2C12 (15 mL) was added carefully over 10 min, while the temperature was kept at -78 °C. The stirring was continued for 30 min and then dry Et3N (8.0 g, 80 mmol) was added at the same temperature. The mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature, CH2C12 (100 mL) was subsequently added, and again it was cooled to -78 °C. The solution was treated with saturated NaCl (40 mL) and then the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature. The organic layer was separated, dried (Na2SO4), and concentrated under reduced pressure.

Compounds 15 and 17-36 were synthesized as shown in Figures 4-6. Most analogues contained a 2-chloro substituent, although 2-amino (IS), 2-iodo (35), and 2-alkylthio (36) groups were also included.<br>
The general synthetic route follows the method of Joshi et al., supra. The protected (N)-methanocarba ring system 116 containing a carbonyl group at the 5'-position was prepared in 8 steps from isopropylidene erythronolactone 105. Compound 37 and the nucleobase precursor, 2,6-dichloropurine, were condensed using a Mitsunobu coupling. Substitution of the 6-chloro of 117 was then carried out by treating with an excess of the appropriate amine, such as a substituted benzylamine, to provide the series of protected nucleoside 5'-esters 39 - 54. Following appropriate substitution at the N6 position, the 5'-esters were treated with an excess of methylamine, and the isopropylidene group was removed from the 2'- and 3'-hydroxyl groups upon acid treatment to provide compounds 16 - 33.<br>
The various benzylamine derivatives used in this study, when not commercially available, were synthesized by the methods shown in Figure 5. 2,5-Dichlorobenzylamine 64 and 2-chloro-5-iodobenzylamine 65 were prepared from the corresponding benzyl bromides. Compound 60 was prepared from 2-chloro-5-iodotoluene by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide in CCl4. Wilson et al., J. Med. Chem 1989, 32, 1057-1062. 60 and 61 were treated with potassium phthalimide in N,N- dimethylformamide at 60°C to obtain compounds 62 and 63 as white solids in 95% yield. Deprotection with hydrazine gave 64 and 65 in 80% yield. Treu et al., Molecules<br>
2002, 7, 743-750.<br>
5-Iodo-2-methoxybenzylamine 68 was prepared starting from 5-<br>
iodosalicylaldehyde 66. Accordingly, compound 66 was methylated with methyl iodide in the presence of K2CO3 in N,N-dimethylformamide and subsequently, the formyl moiety was transformed to methylamino by reductive amination with NaCNBH4 in the presence of ammonium acetate, William seta\.,JOC 1989, 52, 2615-2617.<br>
Compounds 72 and 73 were synthesized through a Sonogashira-type reaction in high yield using Cul and (Ph3P)PdCl2 as catalysts. Sonogashira et al., Tet. Lett. 1975, 4467-4470. For the preparation of both 5-chloro-2-benzyloxybenzylamine 76 and 5-chloro-2-(aminocarbonylrnethyloxy)benzylamine 80, 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzamide 74<br>
26 <br>
was used as starting material. Compound 74 was treated with benzyl bromide in the presence of K2CO3 in N,N-dimethylformamide to obtain 5-chloro-2-benzyloxybenzamide 75 in 98% yield. Finally, the amide 75 was reduced to the corresponding amine 76 with LIAlH4 in tetrahydrofuran.<br>
Reduction of compound 74 with LiAlH4 in tetrahydrofuran gave 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzylamine 77 in 88% yield. This preparation showed an improvement over the reported procedure, based on the hydrogenation of 5-chloro-2-hydroxybenzaldehyde oxime. Tucker et al., J. Med. Chem., 1998,41,3210-3219. The amine 77 was protected as a t-butylcarbamate 78, and the hydroxyl group was alkylated with 2-bromoacetamide in the presence of K2CO3 in Ay/-dimethylformamide. The subsequent deprotection of the amino group with 15% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromethane gave the final product 80 as a white solid.<br>
Substitution at the 2-position by groups other than chloro was possible and accomplished by condensing the appropriate 2-substituted nucleobases with the (N)-methanocarba sugar moiety 116 to provide the protected nucleoside esters 55 and 56<br>

EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example illustrates some of the biological properties of compounds in accordance with an embodiment of the invention.<br>
[125I]N6-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-metthyluronamide (I-AB-MECA; 2000 Ci/mmol), [3H]R-PIA (R- N6-[phenylisopropyl]adenosine, 34 Ci/mmol), [3H]CGS21680 (2-p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido-adenosine, 47 Ci/mmol) and [3H]cyclic AMP (40 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Buckinghamshire, UK).<br>
CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells expressing the recombinant human A3 adenosine receptor were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 µmol/ml glutamine and 800 µg/ml geneticin. The CHO cells expressing rat A3 adenosine receptor were cultured in DMEM and F12 (1:1). Cells were harvested by trypsinization. After homogenization and suspension, cells were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min, and the pellet was re-suspended in 50 mM TrisHCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mg/ml CHAPS. The suspension was homogenized with an electric homogenizer for 10 sec, and was then re- centrifuged at 20,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The resultant pellets<br>
41 <br>
were resuspended in buffer in the presence of 3 Units/ml adenosine deaminase, and the suspension was stored at -80°C until the binding experiments. Striatal and forebrain tissues from Wistar rats were homogenized in ice-cold 50 mM TrisHCl buffer, pH 7.4, using an electric homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellet was washed in fresh buffer. The final pellet was stored at -80°C until the binding experiments. The protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Bradford et al., Anal. Biochem. 1976, 72, 248-254.<br>
Binding assays at the Ai and A2A receptors. For binding to rat A1 receptors, the radioligand [3H]CCPA (0.5 nM) was incubated with rat brain membranes. For binding to human Ai receptors, [3H]R-PIA (N6-[(R)-phenylisopropyI]adenpsine, 2 nM) was incubated with membranes.(40 µg/tube) from CHO cells stably expressing human Al receptors at 25 °C for 60 min in 50 mM Tris. HCl buffer (pH 7.4; MgCI2, 10 mM) in a total assay volume of 200 u.1. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 µM of CPA (N6-cyclopentyladenosine). For human A2A receptor binding, membranes (20 µg/tube) from HEK-293 cells stably expressing human A2A receptors were incubated with [3H]CGS21680 (2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)phenyl-ethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido-adenosine, 15 nM) at 25 °C for 60 min in 200 µ.1 50 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mM MgCh. NECA (10 µM) was used to define nonspecific binding. Reaction was terminated by filtration with GF/B filters.<br>
Binding assay for the A3 adenosine receptor was performed using [l25I]4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-Ar-methyluronamide. Each tube in the competitive binding assay (Olah et al., Mol; Pharmacol. 1994, 45, 978-982) contained 100 µl membrane suspension (20µg protein), 50 µl [l25I]4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-/V-methyluronamide (1.0 nM), and 50 µl of increasing concentrations of the test ligands in TrisHCl buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) containing 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA. Nonspecific binding was determined using 10 µM of 5'-7V-ethylcarboxamido- adenosine in the buffer. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 60 min. Binding reactions were terminated by filtration through Whatman GF/B filters under reduced pressure using a MT-24 cell harvester (Brandell, Gaithersburg, MD). Filters were washed three times with 9 ml ice-cold buffer. Radioactivity was determined in a Beckman 5500B y-counter.<br>
The cyclic AMP accumulation assay was performed as follows. Intracellular cyclic AMP levels were measured with a competitive protein binding method. Nordstedt et al., Anal. Biochem. 1990, 189,231-234; Post et al., Methods Mol. Biol. 2000,126, 363-374. CHO cells that expressed recombinant human and rat A3 or the human A] adenosine receptors were harvested by trypsinization. After centrifugation and resuspension in medium, cells were plated in 24-well plates in 1.0 ml medium. After 24<br>
42 <br>
hr, the medium was removed and cells were washed three times with 1 ml DMEM, containing 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4. Cells were then treated with agonists and/or test compounds in the presence of rolipram (10 µM) and adenosine deaminase (3 units/mL). After 45 min forskolin (10 µM) was added to the medium, and incubation was continued an additional 15 min. The reaction was terminated by removing the supernatant, and cells were lysed upon the addition of 200 µL of 0.1 M ice-cold HC1. The cell lysate was resuspended and stored at -20°C. For determination of cyclic AMP production, protein kinase A (PKA) was incubated with [3H]cyclic AMP (2 nM) in K2HPO4/EDTA buffer (K2HP04,150 mM; EDTA, 10 mM), 20 µL of the cell lysate, and 30 µL 0.1 M HC1 or 50 µL of cyclic AMP solution (0-16 mmol/200 µL for standard curve). Bound radioactivity was separated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/C filters and washed once with cold buffer. Bound radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry.<br>
Anti-ischemic Cardioprotection. Langendorff perfusion of the mouse hearts was carried out. Mice were anesthetized with 60 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (i.p.), and heart excised in ice-cold perfusion buffer. The aorta was cannulated and retrograde perfused in the Langendorff mode at a pressure of 55 mmHg. To assess ispvolumic function, fluid-filled polyvinyl plastic film balloons were inserted into the left ventricle via the left atrium. Balloons were connected to a fluid-filled pressure transducer to measure the left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP), +dP/dt, -dP/dt, and heart rate. To induce normothermic global ischemia and reperfusion, retrograde perfusion of the aorta was stopped, and hearts were immersed in the same perfusion buffer in a water-jacketed bath maintained at 37'C. After 35-min ischemia and 30-min reperfusion, the recovery of left ventricular function was determined by quantifying the LVDP, +dP/dt, and -dP/dt. To quantify the infarct, the hearts were retrograde perfused with 1% triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) in perfusion buffer for 10 minutes after 120-min reperfusion, which allowed washout of pyridine nucleotides from necrotic cells as required for TTC staining. The heart was then immersed in the same TTC buffer for another 10 minutes. The hearts were frozen, cut into six or seven 1 mm slices from apex to base, and scanned for measurement of infarct size by computer morphometry (Image-Pro Plus, version 5.0, Media Cybernetics, Inc, Silver Spring, MD). The infarct size was quantified as the area of necrosis normalized to the total ventricular area. To assess the anti-ischemic cardioprotective effect of adenosine receptor agonists, vehicle (0.1%<br>
DMSO in perfusion buffer) or compound 104 (30 nM) dissolved in DMSO and diluted in buffer were administered in Langendorff mode for five minutes prior to the normothermic global ischemia/reperfusion.<br>

Compound 104 was equipotent in binding to human and rat Ai adenosine receptors with K, values of 18.3 and 17.4 nM, respectively. Also, the affinity of compound 104 was similar at human and rat A3 adenosine receptors with Kj values of 3.7 and 5.8 nM, respectively. Concentration response curves of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated production of 3',5'-cyclic-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in intact transfected CHO cells indicate that compound 104 is a dual acting full agonist with nearly equivalent functional potencies at human A1 (EC50 = 8.2 nM) and A3 (EC50 = 2.8 nM) adenosine receptors.<br>
Compound 104 was tested in an intact mouse heart model of ischemia and reperfusioncompound 104 at 30 nM exerted a potent anti-ischemic cardioprotective effect (Table 2). The mixed agonist was perfused until the induction of ischemia. The recovery of left ventricular developed pressure, +dP/dt, -dP/dt and heart rate all improved significantly following treatment with the mixed agonist 104. The infarct size determined using computer morphometry after staining with triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was significantly reduced in the group treated with 104. The percent necrosis in the group treated with 104 was 15 ± 7% compared to 23 ± 8% in the vehicle-treated controls, n = 6.<br>

Inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production induced by compound 104 in CHO cells stably transfected with the human A1 (■) or A3 (a) adenosine receptors in Figure 8. All experiments were performed in the presence of 10 µM rolipram and 3 Units/ml adenosine deaminase. Forskolin (10 µM) was used to stimulate cyclic AMP levels. The level of cAMP corresponding to 100% was 220 ± 30 pmol/mL. The data shown were from one experiment performed in duplicate and are typical of two independent experiments giving similar results. EC50 values<br>
were 8.2 and 2.8 nM at the Ai or A3 adenosine receptor, respectively. 100% values are normalized to the maximal effect of NECA (10 (µM) as a full agonist at either the A1 or A3 adenosine receptor.<br>
