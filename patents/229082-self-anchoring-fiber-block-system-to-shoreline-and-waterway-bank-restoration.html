				<td>The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to construction technology.<br>
The present invention relates to self -Anchoring Block System for lining the shore lines or waterway banks of a lake or waterway to control erosion of the shore line or waterway bank while promoting environmental friendly vegetation growth on the shoreline or waterway bank.<br>
The following description traces the prior girt technology, the problem associated with the prior art technology and the solution in order to overcome the problem associated with the prior art. In the following description various prior art specifications by way of US Patent documents are cited. A critical examination of the prior art technology is made, the deficiency associated with the prior art technology is identified and accordingly a novel solution is proposed by the applicant in order to overcome the deficiencies associated with the prior art.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Increasing urban developments lead to building more and more paved surfaces such as parking lots, paved roads and many other man made structures leading to significant reduction in natural earth surface area. Decrease in exposed natural earth surface area reduces infiltration of rain water during rain storms and increases runoff. Increased runoff creates flooding in waterways and also<br><br>
increases flow velocities. These increased flow velocities and volumes cause significant erosion on the waterway banks. The erosion damages to waterway banks create many threads to environment such as eco systems located along the waterway banks. Also severe washouts on the waterway bank may damage properties located in close proximity to the banks. Therefore there is a growing need for preventing waterway bank and shoreline erosion and restoration of eroded waterway bank and shoreline without disturbing eco systems associated with them.<br>
Currently various methods used to create stable waterway banks and shorelines. One such method is to line the banks of waterway or shoreline with concrete. Such a method requires any vegetation growing along the banks be removed leaving to complete destruction in the eco system along the waterway or shoreline. It also reduces much needed green spaces in urban areas.<br>
Another method is use of rocks to create riprap. This method stacks boulders to cover the waterway banks or shorelines. This method has similar disadvantages as concrete linings and in addition boulders in riprap tend to move and block water flow during severe flow conditions. Both concrete and riprap are expensive to install on waterway banks and shorelines.<br><br><br><br>
Prior art methods presented in US Patent numbers 5338131, 5678954, 5425597 and 5641244 to BestMann have attempted to prevent waterway banks and shoreline erosion using various objects where vegetation grow on them initially and later on the banks and shorelines. Although various methods described in Bestmann's Patents successfully promote use of vegetation to stop erosion on waterway banks and shorelines, they all have a common problem in installation of the objects. Bestmann's manmade objects use in waterway banks and shorelines require extensive use of anchors to install them to the bank or shoreline. The anchors use for installation is wooden stakes, steel cables and anchor plates. Various deficiencies exist in this anchor system. When the installed bank or shoreline protection system is submerged in water wooden stakes anchor down the system tend to become loose due to buoyancy effect resulting failure in this system. Moreover wooden stakes tend to rot and diminish their effectiveness within short period of time leading to failure in the anchors. More difficulties exist in using wooden stakes or steel cables or anchor plates during installation of Bestmann's objects. They require extensive labour in installation leading to expensive installation costs. Moreover use of metal objects in many environmental sensitive areas are prohibited and this lead to only available anchor system or insulations of Bestmann's method to be wooden stakes. Then the use of wooden anchors runs in the previously described shortcomings. Therefore there is a need for waterway banks and shoreline protection and restoration system, which is capable of protecting waterway banks and shoreline for extended time with environmentally friendly and long term anchoring method. Further more the system should promote growth of vegetation on it and protect waterway banks and shoreline.<br><br>
Another problem in method described in Bestmann's Patents is weak connections between objects described in patents when try to create and extended length to cover long sections. Many instances when placed side by side to increase length of protected area; products of Bestmann's patents tend to shift from their alignment with time. Therefore there is a need for waterway banks and shoreline protection and restoration system with proper connecting method to increase its length when necessary which is capable of waterway banks and shorelines for extended period of time without moving from their alignment while maintaining their structural integrity.<br>
US Patent Number 6234721 to Cronkhite et al. describes an erosion prevention block of a hollow and L - shaped plastic block. Use of this blocks waterway banks and shorelines to stop erosion is not an environmental friendly approach. When installed these block systems act similar to concrete wall and do not promote vegetation on the promoted surface. Therefore, Cronkhite et al's erosion prevention block system has problems similar to concrete lining on waterway banks and shorelines. Moreover, these blocks are too complicated to handle during installation. Another major disadvantage of these blocks is their permanent nature. In today's rapidly developing world a man made waterway may need expansion in future. Use of these plastic blocks creates a major problem in disposing them in an event of expansion. Moreover these plastic blocks are not expectable to use environmentally sensitive wetland and wildlife habitat promoting areas due to their environmentally unfriendly artificial nature. Therefore there is a need for waterway banks and shoreline protection method which environmentally friendly. Easy to use and natural in nature features.<br>
US patent number 5951202 to Brown describes shoreline erosion preventing bank installation. Problem in this system includes anchoring to the shoreline bank. The system is anchored to the shoreline bank using cables, steel anchor piles and<br><br>
metal staples. Use of these anchors is not only expensive but also labour intensive. Some of the other elements in the system are metallic mesh, synthetic erosion mat and wire mesh. All these metal and synthetic materials are not expectable to use in environmentally sensitive wetland and wild life habitat promoting areas. Many instances synthetic nets in synthetic erosion mat interfere with reptiles, birds and fish leading to trap them and eventually kill them. Therefore there is need for system with environmentally friendly and easy to anchor without extensive use of anchors for shoreline erosion prevention.<br>
US patent number 6267533 to Bourg describes a shoreline erosion control system comprises interlocking and layered elements made of concrete. Once installed, this system acts similar to concrete paved surface. Therefore, Bourg's erosion control system has problems similar to concrete lining on shorelines and it is not for environmentally sensitive and wildlife habitat promoting shorelines. Therefore, there is a need for shoreline erosion control method with wildlife habitat friendly and natural in nature features.<br>
US patent number 6168349 to Perslow, et al. describes a system for lining a bank of a water way. The system comprises two parallel linings of soil cement along the water way bank. Placing soil cement process includes removal of soil along the bank, mixing them with cement and water, placing them back and compacting. If the soil in the bank is not suitable for soil cement process, suitable soil has to be imported from another site. Therefore placing soil cement on a waterway bank is expensive and time consuming. Moreover Perslow, et al's soil cement waterway bank lining system is not friendly to ecosystem along the waterway bank. Soil cement does not promote growth of vegetation on it and it does not promote wildlife habitat either. Therefore there is a need for erosion control method in waterway banks, which does not require importing of soil to replace   existing   soil,   promotes   growth   of   vegetation   while   enhancing<br><br>
surrounding eco system and ultimately erosion resistance is achieved by natural means.<br>
The object of the invention is to overcome the problem associated with the prior art.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses as its principal object a novel waterway banks and shoreline protection and restoration system. The system is easy to install, natural in nature, friendly to wild life habitat, protect waterway banks and shoreline for long time while vegetation is growing, and more importantly anchor by itself upon installation with minimum to none external anchor.<br>

Solid compressed fiber block in the face of fiber block system allows maintaining constant layer heights during and after construction. In general, preferred slope angle of bank is achieved by moving back each subsequent upper layer. Installation of extended lengths is achieved by connecting two fiber block units by inserting male end of one unit into female end of adjacent unit to create a continuous unit and adding more units until desired length is reached. The pouch at female end holds inserted male end and maintains the continuity and the structural integrity of the connection. In this construction procedure weight of the filled soil act as the anchors for installation and no need of extensive external anchors to hold the installation . Only anchors required are the ones to keep the fiber block system in place until the filling on bottom fabric is done and the anchors to hold the wrapped top fabric in place.<br>
Other arrangements of fiber block system include a single layer of fiber block system along the shoreline or waterway bank where soil filling is done on the bottom fabric of the fiber block system and covering the filled soil with top fabric and planting through the fabric and in the fiber block. Many other arrangements of fiber block systems are possible in soil erosion control and ecological restoration works where long - term protection is provided by well grown vegetation and its root structure.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The self - anchoring fiber block system of a first embodiment of the first invention is shown in FIGs 1-9 generally at 10 as shown in FIG.l and FIG. 2, fiber block system FIG. 10 generally consists of a compressed coir fiber block 12 and a high strength coir fabric 14 wrapped around three sides of the compressed<br><br>
coir fiber block 12. High strength coir fabric 14 wrapped on coir fabric block 12 has bottom fabric end 22 and top fabric end 24(FIG. 1, FIG.2 and FIG.3) extending freely out of back face 34 of the fiber block system 10(FIG. 1 and FIG.3). Compressed coir fiber block 12 is secured to the high strength cqir fabric 14 by coir twine 16 running up and down on the back face 34 of the fiber block system 10(FIG. 1 and FIG. 3). High strength coir fabric 14 in fiber block system 10 is woven from coir twine 16. At the male end 18 of the fiber block system 10 high strength coir fabric 14 is wrapped only up to the end of the compressed coir fiber block 12(FIG. 1, FIG.2and FIG. 4). At the female end 20 of the fiber block system 10 high strength coir fabric 14 is wrapped beyond the end of the compressed coir fiber block 12 creating a pouch like formation (FIG. 1, FIG.2and FIG. 4).<br>
In restoration of an eroded shoreline or waterway bank, first place a fiber block system on the shoreline or waterway bank keeping front face 32 of the fiber block system 10 toward waterside 36 and back face 34 of the fiber block system 10 of the bank side 38((FIG. 5 and HG.6). Next, extend the bottom fabric and 22 on the ground and drive wooden wedges 30 to keep it in place. Fill soil on to bottom fabric end 22 up to the height of the fiber block system 10 and reconstruct the eroded bank and cover the filled soil with top fabric end 24 of the fiber block system 10. Once top fabric end 24 is wrapped on filled soil, apply wooden wedges 30 to anchor it to soil. FIG. 6 is an application of single layer of fiber block system 10 in restoration of an eroded waterway bank. In this application, live plant cutting 26 and live plants 28 are inserted on the soil through the top fabric end 24. FIG. 5 is an application of multiple layers of fiber block systems 10 in restoration of an eroded waterway bank. In this application multiple layers of fiber block systems 10 filled with soil are arranged to reconstruct the waterway bank. As shown in FIG. 5, preferred slope angle of the bank is achieved by moving back each subsequent upper layer toward bank side 38. Live plant cuttings 26 are planted on soil between layers and at the top through the top fabric end 24 of the upper fiber block system 10. FIG.5 and FIG. 6 show use of<br><br>
wooden wedges 30 to maintain connection between layers in order to achieve initial anchoring of fiber block system 10. Without wooden wedges 30, fiber block systems 10 may tend to move away from their positions during soil filling.<br>
Once filling of soil is done on bottom fabric end 22 and covers it with top fabric<br>
\ end 24 the anchoring of the fiber block system block system 10 is come from the<br>
weight of soil filled on its bottom fabric end 22. This self anchoring feature of<br>
installed fiber block system 10 guarantees its stability and eliminates the<br>
extensive use of external anchors.<br>
Another feature of fiber block system 10 is its male end 18 and female end 20. FIG. 7 and FIG. 8 shown two fiber block systems 10 and connected two units of fiber block systems 14. When connecting two fiber block systems 10 in field applications male end 18 of one unit is inserted to female end 20 of other unit to form a male and female end connection 42. Then continue installation by filling soil on their bottom fabric end 22. The pouch like formation in the female end 20 supports and holds inserted male end 18 in place and maintains the continuity of front face 34 of fiber block system 10 without any trouble. By repeating this procedure and adding one fiber block system 10 after another it is easy to install<br>
a series of fiber block systems 10 alone a shoreline or waterway bank.<br>
FIG. 9 is a cross sectional application of fiber blocks system shown in the FIG. 5 after several years. After some time grown plants 44 cover the bank and roots 46 of the grown plants 44 grown in the waterway bank or shoreline. These roots 46 go through the fiber block 12 in the fiber block system 10 and anchor it down strongly. By doing this roots 46 hold fiber block 12 in place as a long term protection of the bank. By the time complete bio degradation of fiber block system 10 occurs there are mature grown plants 44 and roots 46 in the soil mass. Matured plants 44 and roots 46 are capable of providing erosion resistance to the erosive forces created by flow of water in waterways and erosive forces created by wave action in shorelines.<br><br>
FIG. 10 A, FIG. 10 B and FIG. 10 C are perspective views of the fiber block system of the present invention as shown in this figures compressed fiber block 12 is secured to tfye high strength coir fabric 14 by coir twine 16 running on the back face 34 and ends of the fiber block system 10. Also as shown in these figures this tying can have various patterns.<br>
FIG. 11 A is a perspective view of another embodiment of the fiber block system of the present invention. In this embodiment top fabric end 24 extends only up to the back face 34 of the fiber Mock system 10. FIG. 11 B is a cross sectional side view of application of fiber block system 10 shown in FIG. 11 A in a waterway bank. In this application bottom fabric end 22 filled with soil for self-anchoring in the fiber block system 10. Wooden stakes 52 provide lateral support for the standing fiber block 12. Since top fabric end 24 is not extending beyond the back face 34 of fiber block system 10, lateral support from wooden stakes 52 is necessary for stability of the construction and wooden stakes 52 do not anchor down the fiber block system 10. FIG. 11 C shows how the fiber block system 10 shown in the FIG. 11 A is connected to another one. The male end 18 is inserted to female end 20 of the other unit to form a male and female end connection 42.<br>
In general fiber block 12 comes in dimensions of 10 feet in length, 16 inches in height and 9 inches in thickness. It is also easily possible to vary these dimensions and change the size of the fiber block system 10. Each size could have its advantages according to its field applications. Various changes, alternatives and modifications will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art following a reading of the foregoing specification. It is intended that any such changes, alternatives and modifications as fall within the scope of the appended claims be considered part of the present invention.
