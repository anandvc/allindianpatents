DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	Referring to Fig. 1, a preferred embodiment of a hand-held device 10<br>
according to the present invention is shown. Hand-held device 10, comprises a handle assembly 12 that mates with at least one removable tip member 14. Handle assembly 12 comprises a generally cylindrical outer housing 16 extending from a proximal end 18 to a distal end 20, and tip member 14 is removably attachable to distal end 20.<br>
[0020]	Referring to Figs. 2-3, housing 16 includes a power source. For<br>
example, in a preferred embodiment at least one battery 22 is disposed in housing 16 toward distal end 20, and preferably two batteries 22 are provided. Throughout the following discussion, batteries 22 may be referred to in the singular or plural, however, it will be recognized that all of the embodiments disclosed herein may be implemented using either one or two batteries. As shown in Fig. 3, batteries 22 may be secured with tape 23 to diminish rattling. A conductor 24 contacts battery 22 adjacent proximal end 18 and extends within housing 16 from proximal end 18 toward distal end 20 to selectively couple battery 22 to tip member 14.   A selectively depressible power button 26 is coupled to the distal end of conductor 24 adjacent distal end 20, and extends through a slot 28 in outer housing 16. In one preferred embodiment, conductor 24 comprises a thin metal strip and power button 26 can be ultrasonically welded to an outside face of conductor 24. Power button 26 is selectively depressible between a rest position and a second position to flex the distal end of conductor 24 to engage tip member 14 and electrically connect tip<br><br>
member 14 to battery 22. A second conductor 30 contacts the distal end of battery 22 and includes a free end 32 that extends radially inward to couple the distal end of battery 22 to tip member 14. As best seen in Fig. 1, distal end 20 of handle assembly 12 includes a pairof circular socket holes 34 and a generally rectangular slot 36 for receiving tip member 14. In a preferred embodiment, power button 26 and housing 16 are made of plastic and housing 16 preferably comprises shell members 38 ultrasonlcally welded together.<br>
[0021]	Referring to Figs. 4-5, one preferred tip member 14 comprises a<br>
cutting tip member and includes first and second conductive prongs 40, 42 extending from a proximal end of a tip body 44. Prongs 40, 42 are electrically coupled to opposing ends of a heating element 46 that extends from the distal end of tip body 44. A rectangular tab 48 extends proximally from tip body 44 and is configured and dimensioned to be received in slot 36 (shown in Fig. 1) of handle assembly 12 for aligning tip body 44 with the handle assembly when tip member 14 is attached to the handle assembly. In a preferred embodiment, tab 48 includes a protrusion 49 along its proximal end and when tab 48 is inserted into rectangular slot 36, the proximal end of tab 48 extends through handle housing 16 and protrusion 49 engages the interior of housing 16 to retain tip member 14 on the handle assembly 12.<br>
[0022]	As best seen in Fig. 5, tip body 44 is tapered from a proximal end to a<br>
narrower distal end and comprises concave lateral cutout portions on the sides to accommodate, for example, a user's fingers to facilitate attachment of the tip to handle assembly 12. Prongs 40, 42 are configured and dimensioned to be received in socket holes 34 when tip member 14 is attached to handle assembly 12. Prongs 40, 42 extend through socket holes 34 and into handle assembly 12 and second prong 42 contacts free end 32 of second conductor 30. Power from<br><br>
battery 22 may be transferred to heating element 46 by depressing power button 26 to flex conductor 24 to engage first prong 40 and complete an electric circuit. Heating element 46 generally comprises a thin wire loop that heats up when an electric current passes through it. The thin wire loop has a relatively small surface area which facilitates efficient heating of material. When heated, the wire loop is configured and dimensioned to operate at a temperature sufficient to cut through a medical implant, and in particular a resorbable implant. In use, the implant may be cut by contacting the heating element 46 to the area of the implant to be cut with power button 26 depressed.<br>
[0023]	Referring to Figs. 6-7, another preferred tip member 60 comprises a<br>
narrow plate bending tip member. The proximal end of tip member 60 is substantially similar to the proximal end of tip member 14 and comprises first and second conductive prongs 60, 62 and a rectangular tab 68 extending from a proximal end of a tip body 64 to attach to the distal end of handle assembly 12 as described above with respect to tip member 14. A generally cylindrical elongate flexible member 70 extends from the distal end of tip body 64 and includes a heating element 72 at the distal end. Flexible member 70 comprises an insulating material covering a conductive element that electrically couples heating element 72 to prongs 60, 62. In a preferred embodiment, a protective covering 74 extends over a portion of tip body 64 and over a portion of elongate member 70 to cover and insulate the electrical connection between prongs 60, 62 and the conductive element extending through elongate member 70. Heating element 72 generally comprises a flat narrow metal plate or bending element. Power from battery 22 may be transferred to heating element 72 when tip member 60 is attached to handle assembly 12, as described above. The flat narrow plate generally has larger surface area than heating element 46, described above, and heating element<br><br>
72 is generally heated to a lower temperature relative to heating element 40. in operation, heating element 72 is configured and dimensioned to operate at a temperature sufficient to bend or form the implant For example, the implant may be formed by contacting the heating element 72 to the area of the implant to be bent with power button 26 depressed. Once sufficiently heated, the heated area of the implant remains malleable for a period of time and the implant may be contoured to a desired geometry.<br>
[0024J	Referring to Figs. 8-11, another preferred tip member 80 comprises a<br>
wide plate bending tip member. The proximal end of tip member 80 is substantially<br>
similar to the proximal end of tip members 14, 60 described above and comprises<br>
first and second prongs 80, 82 and a rectangular tab 88 extending from a proximal<br>
end of a tip body 84 to attach to the distal end of handle assembly 12, as described<br>
above. An elongate member 90 extends from the distal end of tip body 84 and<br>
includes a heating element 92 at the distal end. Elongate member 90 extends at<br>
an angle with respect to handle assembly 12 to facilitate application of heating<br>
element 92 to an implant Heating element 92 generally comprises a large flexible<br>
loop with a generally flat wide section in the central portion.<br>
[0025]	As illustrated in Fig. 11, the flexible loop may have a composite<br>
structure comprising a bottom layer of foam 92a, a flexible heater layer comprising a plastic flexible circuit 92b (i.e. a plurality of copper tracing sandwiched between layers of plastic), and a top layer of metal foil 92c. The bottom foam layer 92a may provide structural support for the plastic flexible circuit 92b, while the top metal foil layer 92c may spread the heat generated by the flexible circuit evenly over the surface of the heating element 92. A battery 96 is disposed in housing 90 towards the distal end to provide additional current to heating element 92. A conductor 94 contacts a coil spring 95 which in turn contacts the distal end of battery 96 adjacent<br><br>
distal end and extends within housing 90, towards heating element 92, selectively coupling battery 96 to heating element 92. A second conductor 100 contacts the distal end of prong 82 and extends within housing 90, towards heating element 92 selectively coupling prong 82 to heating element 92. The proximal end of battery 96 extends to distal end of prong 80, selectively coupling battery 96 with prong 80. Power from battery 22 and battery 96 may be transferred to heating element 92 when tip member 80 is attached to handle assembly 12, and power button 26 is depressed, as described above. The large metal loop of heating element 92 generally has a larger surface area than heating elements 46 and 72, described above. This larger surface area allows the user to bend or form larger implants than with heating element 72. In operation, heating element 92 is configured and dimensioned to operate at a temperature sufficient to bend or form an implant as described above with respect to heating element 72, and is particularly well suited for bending or forming a resorbable mesh.<br>
[0026]	In operation, hand-held device 10 may be used in heating, forming or<br>
cutting medical implants, such as plates, meshes, sheets, screws, and tacks. For instance, device 10 may be used before, during, and after surgery, in-situ or otherwise. In particular, device 10 may be used with resorbable fixation systems such as those used in maxillofacial applications. To cut an implant, the cutting tip member 14 may be attached to distal end 20 of handle assembly 12. In this regard, rectangular tab 48 should be aligned with slot 36 for aligning tip body 44 with handle assembly 12 when tip member 14 is attached to handle assembly 12. In use, power button 26 may be depressed for approximately 3-5 seconds to heat up heating element 46. While keeping power button 26 depressed, heating element 46 may be applied to the area of the implant to be cut. After the implant<br><br>
has been cut, tip member 14 can be removed  from the handle and other tip members can be attached to handle assembly 12.<br>
[0027]	To heat an implant, such as a resorbable plate, for forming or bending<br>
the implant, the narrow plate bending tip member 60 or the wide plate bending tip member 80 may be attached to distal end 20 of handle assembly 12. In use, power button 26 may be depressed for approximately 5-10 seconds to heat up heating element 72, or approximately 10-15 seconds to heat up heating element 92. White keeping power button 26 depressed, heating element 72, 92 may be applied to the area of the implant to be heated for forming or bending. In a preferred embodiment, the heating element 72, 92 is applied to the implant for approximately 10-15 seconds. After the implant has been sufficiently heated, the heated area will generally remain malleable for a period of time, during which the implant can be contoured to a desired geometry. In a preferred embodiment, the implant remains malleable for approximately 7-10 seconds. After the implant is contoured to the desired geometry it may be allowed to cool to original rigidity. To contour additional areas of the implant the process can be repeated.<br>
[0028]	Referring again to Fig. 1, device 10 may be a single use device that is<br>
disposable after use. In a preferred embodiment, a stress channel 37 extends around the circumference of outer housing 16 proximal to power button 26. If desired, prior to disposal of handle assembly 12, the batteries 22 within handle assembly 12 can be removed for reuse or separate disposal by cracking housing 16 open at stress channel 37.<br>
[0029]	As will be appreciated, the tip members described above can be<br>
interchangably attached to handle assembly 12. Such interchangeability advantageously provides the user an option to use different tip members as appropriate, depending on the type of implant to be cut, formed, contoured, or<br><br>
otherwise heated, particularly in the case of resorbable implants. For example, cutting tip member 14 is generally well suited for cutting implants such as resorbable plates, and screws. Narrow plate bending tip 60 is generally well suited for forming or bending resorbable plates and wide plate bending tip member 80 may be more appropriate for use to form or bend a resorbable mesh material. In this regard, a kit for use with a resorbable fixation system may be provided that comprises a handle assembly 12, cutting tip member 14, narrow plate bending tip member 60, and wide plate bending tip member 80. In a preferred kit, a handle assembly 12 will be provided, as will one cutting tip member 14, and either a narrow or wide plate bending tip member 60, 80.<br>
