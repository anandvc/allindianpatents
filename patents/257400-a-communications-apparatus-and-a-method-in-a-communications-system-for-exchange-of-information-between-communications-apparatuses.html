DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 The present invention relates to a.<br>
communications system for exchange of information (data)<br>
between communications apparatuses by a multicarrier<br>
transmission mode by a series of subcarriers, more<br>
particularly relates to a communications apparatus<br>
accommodated in that communications system.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
 A most preferred example of the above<br>
communications system discussed in the present invention<br>
is a mobile communications system. The following<br>
explanation will be made by taking as an example this<br>
mobile communications system. Accordingly, if according<br>
to this example, the communications apparatus is a (i)<br>
base station (or a higher base station controller<br>
thereof) and/or a (ii) mobile station (including a mobile<br>
terminal such as a PDA). Note that for convenience, in<br>
the later explanation, the former (i) will be referred to<br>
as the "base station" and the latter (ii) will be simply<br>
referred to as the "terminal" in some cases. Note that,<br>
as will be clear in the later explanation, the present<br>
invention can be substantially equivalently applied to<br>
not only the above base station, but also the above<br>
terminal. It is not particularly necessary to<br>
differentiate between the two.<br>
 In a mobile communications system, securing a<br>
desired transmission rate for a user is a major issue in<br>
providing it with service. On the other hand, usually the<br>
used frequency band used by the mobile communications<br>
system is fixed for each system. Therefore, even if<br>
employing user multiplexing etc., the maximum<br>
transmission rate thereof ends up being restricted. For<br><br>
this reason, the method of flexibly changing the used<br>
frequency band in accordance with the required<br>
transmission rate is being studied.<br>
 Further, when considered by the mobile<br>
communications system as a whole, the state of usage<br>
differs for each used frequency band. Sometimes a band is<br>
not used at all. For this reason, from the viewpoint of<br>
the effective utilization of the frequency, it has been<br>
studied to make the used frequency band variable.<br>
 Under this situation, technology of making the<br>
used frequency band variable in an MC (Multi-Carrier)-<br>
CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) or OFDM (Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplex) or other multicarrier<br>
transmission mobile communications system has been<br>
proposed. For example, the methods disclosed in the<br>
following four Patent Documents 1 to 4 are proposed.<br>
Details thereof will be explained later with reference to<br>
the drawings, but these may be summarized as follows:<br>
 1) A "multiple connection method and apparatus"<br>
disclosed in Patent Document 1 is characterized by<br>
dividing a series of subcarriers so as to freely assign<br>
used frequency bands to users.<br>
 2) A "mobile station, base station, and mobile<br>
communications network" disclosed in Patent Document 2<br>
are characterized in that a subcarrier band dedicated to<br>
transmission of control signals is set in the<br>
communications network.<br>
 3) A "channel allocation method" disclosed in<br>
Patent Document 3 is characterized by changing the number<br>
of subcarriers in the series of subcarriers in accordance<br>
with length of the communications distance between the<br>
base station and the mobile station.<br>
 4) A "wireless transmission apparatus and<br>
wireless communications method" disclosed in Patent<br>
Document 4 is characterized by changing the bandwidth of<br>
each subcarrier in the series of subcarriers to make the<br>
bandwidth of the used frequency band variable.<br><br>

(A) No. 9-205411<br>

No. 2003-264524<br>
[Patent Document 3] Japanese Patent Publication (A)<br>

[Patent Document 4] Japanese Patent Publication (A)<br>
No. 2002-330467<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
 The prior arts based on the above four Patent<br>
Documents 1 to 4 involve the following problems:<br>
 1) In Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent<br>
Publication (A) No. 9-205411), information on the used<br>
subcarrier is not transmitted, therefore the reception<br>
side must receive all subcarriers and decode them. This<br>
is inefficient.<br>
 2) In Patent Document 2 (Japanese Patent<br>
Publication (A) No. 2003-264524), information on the used<br>
subcarrier is transmitted, but it is necessary to<br>
receive, demodulate, and decode a common control channel<br>
for transmitting this subcarrier information.<br>
 Further, when multiplexing users, the<br>
information needed by the user must be extracted from<br>
data transmitted over the common control channel.<br>
Further, information directed to each user is contained<br>
in that common control channel, therefore the bandwidth<br>
might become insufficient at a low transmission rate.<br>
Furthermore, the common control channel is common to all<br>
users, therefore changing the used subcarrier will end up<br>
having an effect on all users. Accordingly, the<br>
subcarrier of that common control channel cannot be<br>
easily changed.<br>
 3) In Patent Document 3 (Japanese Patent<br>
Publication (A) No. 2004-214746), the bandwidth of the<br>
data channel is made variable, but the common control<br>
channel still uses a fixed frequency band common to all<br><br>
users, so there is the same problem as that of Patent<br>
Document 2.<br>
 4) In Patent Document 4 (Japanese Patent<br>
Publication (A) No. 2002-330467), when considering the<br>
use of user multiplexing, in order to suppress<br>
interference due to the transmissions for many users, it<br>
is necessary to further perform code multiplexing among<br>
users. However, if the bandwidths of the subcarriers<br>
become different among users, the orthogonality of codes<br>
will be deteriorated and will end up becoming a cause of<br>
interference.<br>
 In order to prevent this interference, where a<br>
certain user changes the bandwidth of the subcarrier, the<br>
other users must also change the bandwidths of the<br>
subcarriers to match with that. As a result, the<br>
bandwidths of the subcarriers are broadened due to the<br>
user in a poor transmission situation, so the<br>
transmission efficiency is lowered. Accordingly, there is<br>
the inconvenience that changing the bandwidth of the<br>
subcarrier sometimes will not be an effective means.<br>
 Accordingly, in consideration with the above<br>
problems, an object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a communications system (mobile communications<br>
system) able to freely and easily extend, reduce, or<br>
change the used frequency band of each user within the<br>
overall frequency band allocated to the communications<br>
system and preventing the above extension, reduction, or<br>
change from having an effect on other users, more<br>
particularly a communications apparatus (base station<br>
and/or terminal) for this purpose.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
 According to the present invention, as will be<br>
explained in detail later by using the drawings, a<br>
specific frequency band is first set from among a<br>
plurality of frequency bands obtaining by dividing the<br>
overall frequency band allocated to the communications<br>
system. Then, that specific frequency band is used to<br><br>
transmit "used frequency band information" determining<br>
which of the remaining frequency bands is to be used<br>
between communications apparatuses from one<br>
communications apparatus to another communications<br>
apparatus. Further, that specific frequency band is set<br>
as a "main band" in the above overall frequency band.<br>
This main band transmits the above "used frequency band<br>
information" plus "data information (user data)".<br>
Further, among the above plurality of frequency bands, at<br>
least one frequency band set from among the frequency<br>
bands other than the above "main band" is defined as an<br>
"extension band". This extension band is mainly used for<br>
transmitting further data information and can deal with<br>
an increase of amount of data. Accordingly, this<br>
extension band is set according to need. However, the<br>
above main band is always set at the time of<br>
establishment of a wireless channel. In addition, this<br>
main band transmits not only the above "used frequency<br>
band information", but also the inherent "data<br>
information" (user data) within a range permitted by the<br>
transmission capacity. Further, this main band can<br>
include also general "control information" (user control<br>
information). Due to this, the above problems are solved.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
 First of all, to speed the understanding of the<br>
present invention, the prior arts (Patent Documents 1 to<br>
4) explained above will be explained with reference to<br>
the drawings.<br>
 FIG. 34 is a view showing the gist of the prior<br>
art disclosed in Patent Document 1. The figure shows the<br>
allocation of frequencies to for example seven users U1<br>
to U7 (top part). The bottom parts shows details of the<br>
allocation of a series of subcarrier to the users Ul and<br>
U2. The abscissa is the frequency.<br>
 The present system is characterized by<br>
consecutively arranging a plurality of carriers for the<br>
frequency bands allocated at the transmission side,<br>
dividing them into a plurality of subcarriers in<br>
accordance with the users (Ul to U7), and consecutively<br>
arranging these.<br>
 Specifically, for example, the overall<br>
frequency band able to be used in one communications<br>
system is set as 20 MHz, and 250 subcarriers are set<br>
there. Accordingly, the bandwidth of each subcarrier<br>
becomes 20 MHz/250 = 80 kHz. Then, these 250 subcarriers<br>
are used while being dynamically allocated among the<br>
plurality of users (U1 to U7).<br>
 At this time, for example, the subcarriers are<br>
dynamically allocated, for example, 50 subcarriers are<br>
allocated to a user A (U2) and 75 subcarriers are<br>
allocated to another user B (Ul), to make the number of<br>
subcarriers used variable.<br>
 Along with that, the used frequency band<br>
becomes 50 x 80 kHz = 4 MHz for the user A and becomes 75<br>
x 80 kHz = 6 MHz for the user B. That is, the used<br>
frequency band is made variable for each user. In this<br>
case, it is assumed that the allocated subcarriers are<br>
consecutive on the frequency axis. Note that it is also<br>
possible to further make the sizes of the divisions of<br>
the frequency band variable.<br><br>
 FIG. 35 is a view showing the gist of the prior<br>
art disclosed in Patent Document 2. The figure is a view<br>
showing the state of allocation of the common control<br>
channel and the data channel on the frequency axis.<br>
 In the present system, in a multicarrier CDMA<br>
system, the subcarriers dedicated to the transmission of<br>
the control signal and the subcarriers dedicated to the<br>
transmission of data (data channel) are separately set.<br>
The common control channel thereof is spread by a unique<br>
spread code. Accordingly, when this common control<br>
channel is received, it is sufficient to demodulate<br>
specific subcarriers, so the amount of signal processing<br>
thereof can be reduced.<br>
 FIG. 36 is a view showing the gist of the prior<br>
art disclosed in Patent Document 3. The figure shows<br>
making the frequency band of the data channel in FIG. 35<br>
described above variable in accordance with a propagation<br>
distance (communication distance with the base station).<br>
Note that the transmission power is changed (large -<br>
medium - small).<br>
 The present system is a system for realizing<br>
variable speed communication by making the transmission<br>
rate per subcarrier fixed and making the number of<br>
subcarriers allocated to the user variable. When the<br>
distance between the base station and the terminal is<br>
short, the transmission power of each subcarrier is made<br>
small and many subcarriers are allocated, while when that<br>
distance is long, the transmission power of each<br>
subcarrier is made large and a small number of<br>
subcarriers are allocated.<br>
 Further, the number of subcarriers used for the<br>
common control channel is made small, while a large<br>
number of subcarriers are allocated with respect to the<br>
data communications use channel (data channel). The two<br>
are completely separately arranged along the frequency<br>
axis. Note that the subcarriers dedicated to the common<br>
control channel are used to notify the center subcarrier<br><br>
number of the subcarriers allocated for the data channel<br>
and the number of used subcarriers from the base station<br>
to the mobile station.<br>
 FIG. 37 is a view showing the gist of the prior<br>
art disclosed in Patent Document 4. The figure shows that<br>
the bandwidth of each subcarrier is made variable in<br>
accordance with whether or not the propagation<br>
environment is good.<br>
 The present system changes the bandwidth of<br>
each subcarrier while making a total number of<br>
subcarriers constant in accordance with the condition of<br>
the propagation environment in wireless transmission. For<br>
example, when the propagation condition becomes poor, the<br>
band of each subcarrier is made wider. Due to this, the<br>
transmission can be carried out without changing the<br>
total subcarriers, therefore the transmission rate can be<br>
maintained constant without regard to the propagation<br>
environment.<br>
 The present invention solves the already<br>
explained problems of the prior arts (Patent Documents 1<br>
to 4) explained with reference to FIG. 34 to FIG. 37<br>
explained above. This will be explained in detail below<br>
with reference to the drawings.<br>
 FIG. 1 is a view showing the basic<br>
configuration of a communications apparatus (transmission<br>
side) according to the present invention, and<br>
FIG. 2 is a view showing the basic configuration of<br>
a communications apparatus (reception side) according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
 In FIG. 1, reference numeral 10 indicates the<br>
communications apparatus (transmission side), and in FIG.<br>
2, reference numeral 20 indicates the communications<br>
apparatus (reception side). These are accommodated in the<br>
same communications system (mobile communications<br>
system). Note that as already explained, the<br>
communications apparatus 10 may be a base station and the<br>
communications apparatus 20 may be a terminal, or vice<br><br>
versa. The present invention can be applied to both<br>
cases, but for easier understanding, in the following<br>
explanation, the communications apparatus 10 on the<br>
transmission side will be assumed as the base station,<br>
and the communications apparatus 20 on the reception side<br>
will be assumed as a terminal unless otherwise indicated.<br>
 First, referring to FIG. 1, the selection<br>
function in particular of a used frequency band<br>
selecting/setting unit 15 is used to select the used<br>
frequency band to be used with the other communications<br>
apparatus 20. The "used frequency band information" If<br>
(frequency) according to this selection is input to a<br>
transmission data generation unit 11 where transmission<br>
data Dt (transmission) combined integrally with<br>
transmission data (user data) Du (user) to be transmitted<br>
to the communications apparatus 20 is generated.<br>
Accordingly, the transmission data Dt includes the<br>
transmission data Du and the used frequency band<br>
information If, but in actuality further includes also<br>
other "communication control information" let (control).<br>
This information let is the information concerning a used<br>
modulation scheme for example QAM and information etc.<br>
concerning a one time transmission data amount of the<br>
transmission data Du.<br>
 The above transmission data Dt is modulated in<br>
a predetermined way at a modulation unit 12, then input<br>
to the next multicarrier transmission sender unit 13.<br>
This sender unit 13 is supplied with a band set<br>
instruction signal Sb (band) instructing processing for<br>
transmission at the above selected used frequency band by<br>
the setting function of the above used frequency band<br>
selecting/setting unit 15. The sender unit 13 performs<br>
the processing for signal transmission by multicarrier<br>
transmission at the frequency band based on this signal<br>
Sb.<br>
 Further, a wireless unit 14 converts the<br>
frequency conversion of the transmission data signal St<br><br>
from the above sender unit 13 and transmits this from the<br>
next antenna AT toward another communications apparatus<br>
(terminal) 20.<br>
 On the other hand, referring to FIG. 2, the<br>
wireless signal from the above antenna AT (FIG. 1) is<br>
received at the antenna AT (FIG. 2) and further converted<br>
in frequency by a wireless unit 21 to be a received data<br>
signal Sr which is then input to a multicarrier<br>
transmission receiver unit 22. This receiver unit 22<br>
processes the received data signal Sr for signal<br>
reception according to the multicarrier transmission,<br>
then the next demodulation unit 23 demodulates the signal<br>
after the signal reception processing.<br>
 The demodulated received data Dr is decoded at<br>
a received data decoding unit 24 and separated to the<br>
original transmission data Du and the previously set used<br>
frequency band information If explained before. Further,<br>
the above communication control information let is also<br>
separated from that data Dr. Note that the units to be<br>
controlled according to this information let are not<br>
directly related to the gist of the present invention, so<br>
explanations are omitted.<br>
 As explained above, the original used frequency<br>
band information If obtained by separation from the<br>
received data Dr is input to a used frequency band<br>
setting unit 25. The setting unit 25 receives this<br>
information If and reproduces the above band set<br>
instruction signal Sb. This signal Sb is supplied to the<br>
above multicarrier transmission receiver unit 22, then<br>
this receiver unit 22 performs processing for signal<br>
reception according to the multicarrier transmission by<br>
using the frequency band selected on the transmission<br>
side. Note that the previously determined frequency band<br>
may be selected in the initial stage of establishment of<br>
the wireless channel.<br>
 In the present invention, the transmission side<br>
(10) and the reception side (20) can use the same used<br><br>
frequency band by the above-explained band set<br>
instruction signal Sb. Further, based on that signal Sb,<br>
that used frequency band can be simultaneously extended,<br>
reduced, or changed at both of the transmission side (10)<br>
and the reception side (20). Thus, the object of the<br>
present invention explained before can be achieved.<br>
 The basic configuration of the present<br>
invention explained above will be explained a little more<br>
concretely in comparison with the above prior arts.<br>
 In the present invention, the frequency band<br>
usable in the communications system as a whole is divided<br>
into a plurality of bands. For example, when the used<br>
frequency band of the communications system as a whole is<br>
set as 20 MHz, it is divided into four bands of 5 MHz<br>
each. One band 5 MHz is used to transmit the information<br>
of the control channel for transmitting the used<br>
frequency band information and the transmission channel<br>
(data channel) for transmitting the transmission data.<br>
 According to the present invention, as<br>
explained before, the frequency band for transmitting at<br>
least the control channel is defined as the "main band"<br>
and a further extended frequency band is defined as an<br>
"extension band". For example, when considering this in<br>
an OFDM communications system, 100 subcarriers are<br>
included in one band 5 MHz, the bandwidth of each<br>
subcarrier is 50 kHz, and the information of the control<br>
channel and the data channel are transmitted by using the<br>
series of these 100 subcarriers. The two information may<br>
be multiplexed by time division multiplexing, frequency<br>
division multiplexing, or code division multiplexing.<br>
 As explained above, unlike Patent Document 3<br>
(Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 2004-214746), the<br>
information of the "main band" is received and decoded to<br>
learn the used frequency band (or number of used<br>
frequency bands), therefore, the used frequency band can<br>
be easily extended, reduced, and changed. Further, due to<br>
this, unlike Patent Document 1 (Japanese Patent<br><br>
Publication (A) No. 9-205411) and Patent Document 3<br>
(Japanese Patent Publication No. 2004-214746), the<br>
configuration of the reception unit is simplified.<br>
 Further, if making the number of subcarriers<br>
per frequency band constant, the number of subcarriers<br>
will change with a ratio of a whole number along with a<br>
change of the number of used frequency bands.<br>
Accordingly, when compared with Patent Document 3<br>
(Japanese Patent Publication (A) No. 2004-214746) in<br>
which the subcarriers dynamically change, the<br>
configuration of the reception unit is simplified.<br>
 Further, by designating the used frequency band<br>
from the base station to the terminals in advance, the<br>
extension band described above can be easily changed and<br>
added to and even the main band can be changed.<br>
 Further, if making the bandwidth of each<br>
subcarrier fixed as explained above, the used frequency<br>
band can be changed without influencing other users as in<br>
Patent Document 4 (Japanese Patent Publication (A) No.<br>
2002-330467). Various embodiments according to the<br>
present invention will be explained below.<br>
[Embodiment 1: Setting of used frequency band]<br>
First, describing some characteristic features<br>
disclosed in the present Embodiment 1, these are as<br>
follows. The principal points of these characteristic<br>
features are as already described and reside in the<br>
following three points (i) to (iii):<br>
 (i) A specific frequency band from among a<br>
plurality of frequency bands formed by dividing the<br>
overall frequency band allocated to a communications<br>
system is set, and that specific frequency band is used<br>
to transmit "used frequency band information" If<br>
determining which remaining frequency band is to be used<br>
between communications apparatuses (10, 20), (ii) that<br>
specific frequency band is set as a "main band" in the<br>
overall frequency band, and that main band transmits, in<br>
addition to the used frequency band information If, data<br><br>
information Du, and (iii) among the above-explained<br>
plurality of frequency bands, at least one frequency band<br>
set from among the frequency bands other than above "main<br>
band" is defined as an "extension band", and that<br>
extension band mainly transmits further data information<br>
(Du) .<br>
 Next, some principal points further disclosed<br>
in the present Embodiment 1 reside in the following four<br>
points (iv) to (vii):<br>
 (iv) The above "main band" is set fixedly at<br>
the time of the establishment of the wireless channel<br>
between the communications apparatuses (10, 20),<br>
(v) when there are a plurality of communications<br>
apparatuses (20), "main bands" are individually set for<br>
the above plurality of frequency bands and, at the same<br>
time, main bands are individually assigned corresponding<br>
to these plurality of communications apparatuses (20),<br>
(vi) two or more communications apparatuses (20) can<br>
simultaneously use the same "main band" by time division<br>
multiplexing and/or code division multiplexing, and<br>
(vii) further, the number of extension bands is<br>
changed in accordance with the predetermined transmission<br>
rate of the data information (Du).<br>
 FIG. 3 is a view showing a concrete example of<br>
the communications apparatus (transmission side) 10<br>
according to the present invention, and<br>
FIG. 4 is a view showing a concrete example of the<br>
communications apparatus (reception side) 20 according to<br>
the present invention. Note that, same components will be<br>
indicated by same reference numerals or symbols<br>
throughout all of the figures. Further, the concrete<br>
examples shown in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 are not only applied<br>
to the present Embodiment 1, but also commonly applied to<br>
the other Embodiments 2 to 10 explained later.<br>
 Referring to the communications apparatus<br>
(transmission side) 10 first, the parts corresponding to<br>
the components 11 to 15 and Du, Dt, St, and Sb shown in<br><br>
FIG. 1 are shown assigned these reference numerals or<br>
symbols 11 to 15 and Du, Dt, St, and Sb.<br>
 The transmission data generation unit 11 is<br>
configured by a data block preparation unit 31, an<br>
encoding unit 32, a transmission data amount calculation<br>
unit 33, an encoding unit 34, and a multiplexing unit<br>
(Mux) 35 according to the example of the present figure.<br>
	Based on the used frequency band information If<br>
from the above used frequency band selecting/setting unit<br>
15, the transmission data amount calculation unit 33<br>
first calculates a transmission data length, then the<br>
data block preparation unit 31 prepares data blocks for<br>
each transmission data length. Further, the encoding unit<br>
32 encodes the transmission data by using that<br>
transmission data length.<br>
 The above used frequency band information If is<br>
encoded together with the communications control<br>
information let indicating the used modulation scheme<br>
etc. at the encoding unit 34. Note that the encoding<br>
units 32 and 34 may encode Du and If all together as one<br>
encoding unit.<br>
 The encoded outputs from the two encoding units<br>
32 and 34 are multiplexed at the multiplexing unit (Mux)<br>
35 and become the already explained transmission data Dt.<br>
This data Dt is further modulated at the modulation unit<br>
12 as explained before. As the method of this<br>
multiplexing, there are frequency division multiplexing<br>
separating subcarriers and using the same, time division<br>
multiplexing (by using for example a frame format shown<br>
in FIG. 16), code division multiplexing etc. Further, as<br>
the modulation scheme by the modulation unit 12, there<br>
are QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, etc.<br>
E-0060] - Next, when looking at the multicarrier<br>
transmission sender unit 13, in the example shown in the<br>
present figure, this is configured by components 36, 37,<br>
38, 39, and 40. Note that this is shown as an example<br>
based on communications according to OFDM. Another<br><br>
example based on communications according to MC-CDMA is<br>
shown in FIG. 7 (FIG. 8).<br>
 The demultiplexing unit (DeMux) 36<br>
demultiplexes this into the information belonging to the<br>
"main band" and the information belonging to the<br>
"extension bands". The information belonging to the "main<br>
band" is converted to a parallel signal at a<br>
serial/parallel converter (S/P) 37, then a time-frequency<br>
transform is applied to the parallel signal at an Inverse<br>
Fast Fourier Transform unit (IFFT) 38. The parallel<br>
signal transformed into frequency is converted to a<br>
serial signal again at a parallel/serial converter (P/S)<br>
39. Further, a guard interval (GI) insertion unit 40<br>
inserts a guard interval GI into the serial signal for<br>
preventing inter-symbol interference.<br>
 The thus obtained transmission data signal St<br>
is input to the wireless unit 14. This wireless unit 14<br>
is, according to the example of the present figure,<br>
configured by a general mixer 41, a local oscillator 42,<br>
and a power amplifier 44 (a D/A converter, a filter, etc.<br>
are omitted) and transmits the transmission data signal<br>
St from the antenna At. In this case, an adder unit 43 is<br>
provided in the middle.<br>
 The adder unit 43 applies the same processing<br>
as the processing for the "main band" by the above-<br>
explained components 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, and 42 with<br>
respect to the information belonging to the above<br>
"extension bands" demultiplexed at the demultiplexing<br>
unit (DeMux) 36 as explained before by the components<br>
37', 38', 39', 40', 41', and 42', obtains the<br>
transmission data signal St on the "extension band" side,<br>
and combines the same together with the already explained<br>
transmission data signal St on the "main band" side.<br>
f<?Q64 ], The transmission data on the "extension band"<br/>
side described above is generated only when data<br>
transmission by the "extension bands" is needed. Whether<br>
or not it is needed is determined according to the band<br><br>
set instruction signal Sb from the already explained<br>
selecting/setting unit 15.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 4 next, parts corresponding<br>
to the components 21 to 25 and Sr, Dr, Du, If, and Sb<br>
shown in FIG. 2 are shown assigned the reference numerals<br>
21 to 25 and symbols Sr, Dr, Du, If, and Sb.<br>
 The wireless unit 21, according to the example<br>
of the present figure, eliminates an undesired band of a<br>
signal in the signal received from the antenna AT by a<br>
band pass filter (BPF) 51, converts the remainder to a<br>
predetermined reception frequency by the mixer 52 and the<br>
local oscillator 53, and thereby obtains the received<br>
data signal Sr.<br>
 This received data signal Sr is input to the<br>
multicarrier transmission receiver unit 22 and processed.<br>
This receiver unit 22 is, according to the example of the<br>
present figure, configured by the components 54, 55, 56,<br>
57, and 58.<br>
 First, the guard interval (GI) elimination unit<br>
54 eliminates the guard interval inserted at the<br>
transmission side. The signal after the GI elimination is<br>
further converted to a parallel signal at the<br>
serial/parallel converter (S/P) 55. The Fast Fourier<br>
Transform unit (FFT) 56 applies a frequency-time<br>
transform to the parallel signal. The time transformed<br>
parallel signal is converted to a serial signal again at<br>
the parallel/serial converter (P/S) 57.<br>
 On the other hand, when the signal received<br>
from the antenna AT contains information belonging to an<br>
"extension band", the mixer 52' and the local oscillator<br>
53' extract the signal of the "extension band" and apply<br>
the same processing as the processing by the above-<br>
explained components 55 to 57 by the same components S/P<br>
55', FFT 56', and P/S 57' to obtain a time-transformed<br>
serial signal.<br>
 The serial signals from the above<br>
parallel/serial converters 57 and 57' are multiplexed at<br><br>
the multiplexing unit (Mux) 58 and further demodulated at<br>
the demodulation unit 23. Note that when only information<br>
belonging to the "main band" is transmitted, the above<br>
multiplexing unit 58 does not perform the multiplexing,<br>
but only passes the signal therethrough.<br>
 The signal from the multiplexing unit 58<br>
becomes the received data Dr demodulated at the next<br>
demodulation unit 23, then is input to the received data<br>
decoding unit 24. This decoding unit 24 is, according to<br>
the example of the present figure, configured by a<br>
demultiplexing unit (DeMux) 59, a data channel decoding<br>
unit 60, a control channel decoding unit 61, and a<br>
transmission data amount calculation unit 62.<br>
 The above demultiplexing unit 24 demultiplexes<br>
the received data Dr to data channel side data and<br>
control channel side data and distributes these to the<br>
decoding unit 60 and the decoding unit 61. From the<br>
decoding unit 60, the original transmission data Du is<br>
reproduced based on the transmission data amount<br>
explained later. On the other hand, from the decoding<br>
unit 61, the "used frequency band information" If is<br>
reproduced.<br>
 The above information If from the decoding unit<br>
61 is input to the transmission data amount calculation<br>
unit 62 on the one hand, the data length of the received<br>
transmission data is calculated here based on that If,<br>
and the transmission data is decoded by the above<br>
decoding unit 60 based on this data length.<br>
 The above information If from the decoding unit<br>
61 is given to the already explained used frequency band<br>
setting unit 25 on the other hand, where the above band<br>
set instruction signal Sb is generated. Then, according<br>
to the content of this signal Sb, the circuit portions<br>
(22, 58, 59) are set corresponding to the selected<br>
frequency band by the shown dotted line route. Note that<br>
the received data decoding unit 24 of FIG. 4 may be<br>
configured so that the received data Dr is input to one<br><br>
decoding unit (making the decoding units 60 and 61<br>
common) at first and decoded, then demultiplexed to the<br>
data channel and the control channel at the<br>
demultiplexing unit 59.<br>
 In the configuration of FIG. 3 and FIG. 4<br>
explained above, the frequency band of the "main band" is<br>
fixed, and only the frequency bands of the "extension<br>
bands" are variable. However, in a certain embodiment of<br>
the present invention, not only the "extension bands",<br>
but also the "main band" can be made variable in<br>
frequency bands. An example of a configuration<br>
accomplishing this is shown in the drawings.<br>
 FIG. 5 is a view showing a modification of the<br>
communications apparatus (transmission side) 10 according<br>
to the present invention, and FIG. 6 is a view showing a<br>
modification of a communications control device<br>
(reception side) 20 according to the present invention.<br>
 The difference between the configuration shown<br>
in these FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 and the configuration shown in<br>
FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 explained before resides in that, in<br>
FIG. 5, the scope of instruction by the band set<br>
instruction signal Sb from the used frequency band<br>
selecting/setting unit 15 reaches not only the "extension<br>
band" side (37' to 42') (case of FIG. 3), but also the<br>
"main band" side (37 to 42). Further, the difference<br>
resides in that, in FIG. 6, the scope of instruction by<br>
the band set instruction signal Sb from the used<br>
frequency band setting unit 25 reaches not only the<br>
"extension band" side (52' to 57') (case of FIG. 4), but<br>
also the "main band" side (52 to 57). Thus, the change of<br>
the frequency band of the "main band" also becomes<br>
possible.<br>
	Further, the explanation of the concrete<br>
example explained above was predicated on communications<br>
by OFDM, but other than this, it is also possible to<br>
explain it based on communications according to the MC-<br>
CDMA. Also, an example of the communications apparatus in<br><br>
this latter case (MC-CDMA base) is shown here.<br>
 FIG. 7 is a view showing another modification<br>
of the communications apparatus (transmission side) 10<br>
according to the present invention, and FIG. 8 is a view<br>
showing another modification of the communications<br>
apparatus (reception side) 20 according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
 For example, when comparing the above FIG. 5<br>
and FIG. 6 and the present FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, on the<br>
transmission side (10), the configuration of the<br>
multicarrier transmission sender unit 13 is different,<br>
and on the reception side (20), the configuration of the<br>
multicarrier transmission receiver unit 22 is different.<br>
 Namely, in the sender unit 13 shown in FIG. 7,<br>
the difference resides in the point that a copier unit 46<br>
and a multiplication unit 47 are used. Further, in the<br>
receiver unit 22 shown in FIG. 8, the difference resides<br>
in the point that a multiplication unit 65 and a<br>
combining unit (£) 66 are used.<br>
 First, the transmission operation will be<br>
explained by using FIG. 7. The generated transmission<br>
data is modulated and copied by the number of subcarriers<br>
at the copier unit 46. The multiplication unit 47<br>
multiplies the copied signals by spread codes (C1, C2 '"<br>
Cn). The IFFT units (38, 38') apply IFFT to the results<br>
to apply a time-frequency transform. Then, the GI<br>
insertion unit 40 inserts a GI, then the signal is<br>
converted in frequency and transmitted from the antenna<br>
AT. Further, the setting of the multicarrier transmission<br>
sender 13 is changed based on the used frequency band<br>
selected at the used frequency band selection unit 15.<br>
 Next, a reception operation will be explained<br>
by using FIG. 8. First, the received signal is frequency<br>
converted to obtain a base band signal, then the GI is<br>
eliminated at the GI elimination unit 54. Next, the<br>
signal is converted from a serial to parallel format (55,<br>
55'), and each of the parallel signals is multiplied by<br><br>
the spread codes (C1, C2 .... Cn) at the multiplication unit<br>
65 and despread. The results thereof are subjected to FFT<br>
at the FFT units (56, 56'), a frequency-time transform is<br>
carried out, then the results are summed up at the<br>
combining unit 66. The result of this is demodulated at<br>
the demodulation unit 23. Below, the same processing as<br>
that explained before is carried out to extract the used<br>
frequency band information If. Then, based on the<br>
extracted used frequency band information If, the setting<br>
of the multicarrier transmission receiver unit 22 is<br>
changed. Note that, in FIG. 7 and FIG. 8, when the used<br>
frequency band is changed, the number n of codes the<br>
frequency spread may be made variable. When MC-CDMA is<br>
used as described above, the hardware configuration can<br>
be simplified in comparison with the OFDM. Further, on<br>
the other hand, there arises a necessity of making the<br>
number of point of FFT and IFFT dynamically variable, so<br>
the control becomes complex.<br>
 Below, the present Embodiment 1 will be further<br>
explained with reference to the arrangement of the<br>
frequency bands.<br>
f©0£5i- A communications system able to change the used<br>
frequency band using OFDM etc. transmits the used<br>
frequency band information If by using a specific<br>
frequency band. Then, by demodulating and decoding the<br>
specific frequency band, the used frequency band If can<br>
be obtained. By this information If, the communications<br>
in an extension band become possible. This is based on<br>
division of the overall frequency band as follows in the<br>
present invention.<br>
£0086]. FIG. 9 is a view showing the pattern of<br>
frequency division in a communications system. The series<br>
of subcarriers of the present figure show the overall<br>
frequency band assigned to the communications system.<br>
This overall frequency band is divided into a plurality<br>
of frequency bands. In the present figure, the example of<br>
division into four is shown, that is, the band is divided<br><br>
into four frequency bands, that is, "BAND 1", "BAND 2",<br>
"BAND 3", and "BAND 4". Then, any of these "BAND 1" to<br>
"BAND 4" is selected and defined as the above "main<br>
band", while another band is selected and defined as an<br>
above "extension band".<br>
 FIG. 10 is a view showing the state of<br>
selecting one "main band" and one "extension band". For<br>
example the above band 1 is selected as the "main band",<br>
and for example the above band 2 is selected as an<br>
"extension band". As explained before, the "main band" is<br>
assigned to the transmission of the control channel (CH)<br>
and the data channel (CH), and the "extension band" is<br>
assigned to the further transmission of the data channel.<br>
The main band used by a certain terminal is determined by<br>
for example the base station or the higher base station<br>
controller. Alternatively, converse to this, the main<br>
band may be designated from the terminal side to the base<br>
station side.<br>
 The above main band may be fixed in advance in<br>
the communications system or may be set at the time of<br>
establishment of a wireless channel between<br>
communications apparatuses (base station and terminal).<br>
The setting may be fixed until the communication is<br>
completed.<br>
 Further, when there are a plurality of<br>
communications apparatuses (user terminals), a different<br>
main band may be set for each user terminal. This<br>
situation will be shown in the figure.<br>
 FIG. 11 is a view showing a first example of a<br>
mode of assignment of main bands for a plurality of<br>
users, and FIG. 12 is a view showing a second example of<br>
a mode of assignment of main bands for a plurality of<br>
users. Note that these modes can also be applied to<br>
extension bands.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 11 first, main bands of users<br>
U1 to U4 are individually assigned to a plurality of<br>
frequency bands, that is, band 1 to band 4. Note that, in<br><br>
this case, the number of users is restricted by the<br>
number of bands.<br>
	Therefore, as shown in FIG. 12, the same main<br>
band is simultaneously assigned with respect to a<br>
plurality of communications apparatuses (user terminals).<br>
This becomes possible by user multiplexing. As this<br>
multiplexing method, there are time division multiplexing<br>
and code division multiplexing or multiplexing combining<br>
these.<br>
 Further, in the present Embodiment 1, also the<br>
number of used frequency bands (band 1 to band 4) can be<br>
changed in accordance with the predetermined transmission<br>
rate of the data information (transmission data Du).<br>
 Namely, the base station considers the<br>
communication situation, propagation environment, used<br>
frequency band, etc. of other terminals in the middle of<br>
communications. When judging that another frequency band<br>
can be used, it extends the used frequency band. Note<br>
that at the time of extension, the available frequency<br>
can be extended on a priority basis according to the<br>
degree of priority of communications between the<br>
terminals, the predetermined transmission rate, and other<br>
transmission data attributes (QoS: Quality of Service).<br>
 In this way, since the used frequency band<br>
information If is transmitted by using a specific<br>
frequency band (main band), the reception side need only<br>
receive that main band first and does not have to receive<br>
and demodulate and decode up to the other frequency<br>
bands. Further, by using the extension band, a further<br>
speed-up of the transmission rate becomes possible, and<br>
an improvement of the frequency utilization efficiency<br>
can be achieved.<br>
[Embodiment 2: Dynamic change of main band]<br>
First, describing some characteristic features<br>
disclosed in the present Embodiment 2, they are as<br>
follows:<br>
 i) The frequency band occupied as the main band<br><br>
among the plurality of frequency bands (band 1 to band 4)<br>
is made variable along with the elapse of time,<br>
ii) whether or not the propagation environment<br>
between communications apparatuses (10, 20) is good is<br>
judged, then the frequency band of the best propagation<br>
environment among the above plurality of frequency bands<br>
or the frequency band next to this is selected and set as<br>
the main band,<br>
iii) at the time of new setting of the main band,<br>
the change of the frequency band is notified to the<br>
communications apparatus of the other party in advance,<br>
iv) the result of detection of the transmission<br>
quality (CQI) obtained in response to a pilot channel or<br>
pilot signal transmitted between communications<br>
apparatuses is used to judge whether or not the above-<br>
explained propagation environment is good,<br>
v) the judgment of whether or not the propagation<br>
environment is good is performed for all of the above<br>
plurality of frequency bands sequentially or<br>
simultaneously; and<br>
vi) further, the result of judgment of the quality<br>
of the propagation environment is sent to the<br>
communications apparatus of the other party by using the<br>
control channel of a specific frequency band.<br>
 In general, the transmission characteristic of<br>
the control channel must be better in terms of the<br>
transmission quality in comparison with the data channel.<br>
First, this is because the channel through which the data<br>
is to be transmitted must be reliably set. Namely, the<br>
main band including the control channel must select the<br>
frequency band having a better propagation environment so<br>
that the transmission quality thereof becomes good in<br>
comparison with the extension band. Therefore, a concrete<br>
example of free selection of the frequency band set as<br>
the main band in accordance with quality of the<br>
propagation environment will be explained.<br>
 FIG. 13 is a flow chart showing an example of<br><br>
dynamically changing the frequency band of a main band.<br>
Note that the basic transmission/reception operation<br>
between the base station and a terminal is as explained<br>
in the above Embodiment 1. Further, in FIG. 13, each<br>
solid line block represents an operation of the base<br>
station, and each dotted line block represents an<br>
operation of the terminal. Note that the reverse may also<br>

 The processing for making the main band<br>
variable along with the elapse of time according to the<br>
above flow chart showing one example in FIG. 13 can be<br><br>
accomplished by for example the following hardware<br>
configuration.<br>
 FIGS. 14A and 14B are views showing an example<br>
of the hardware configuration of the transmission side of<br>
the pilot signal, and FIGS. 15A and 15B are views showing<br>
an example of the hardware configuration of the return<br>
side of the response (CQI) information to the pilot<br>
signal.<br>
 The configurations shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B<br>
are substantially the same as the configuration of FIG. 3<br>
(or FIG. 5) explained before. The elements to be newly<br>
noted are a pilot signal Sp (or pilot channel) on the<br>
left end of FIG. 14A, and a multiplexing unit (Mux) 71<br>
for multiplexing the pilot signal Sp and the used<br>
frequency band information If and a CQI extraction unit<br>
72 in FIG. 14B. The configuration of this FIG. 14B is<br>
substantially the same as the configuration of FIG. 4 (or<br>
FIG. 6) explained before. The component to be newly noted<br>
is a CQI extraction unit 72 on the lower side of the<br>
center of the present figure. Note that, in FIG. 14B,<br>
units corresponding to those in FIG. 4 are given the<br>
reference numerals 52, 53, 54, '" used in FIG. 4 plus 100<br>
and thereby indicated as 152, 153, 154, '".<br>
 Further, the configurations shown in FIG. 15A<br>
and 15B are the same as the configuration of FIG. 4 (or<br>
FIG. 6) explained before. The components to be newly<br>
noted are an SNR measurement unit 7 5 and a CQI<br>
calculation unit 76 in FIG. 15A and further an encoding<br>
unit 78 and an adder unit 79 in FIG. 15B after passing<br>
through a loop back path 77. Note that in FIG. 15A, parts<br>
corresponding to those in FIG. 4 (reception side) are<br>
indicated by using the reference numerals 52, 53, 54, ....<br>
used in FIG. 4, while in FIG. 15B, parts corresponding to<br>
those in FIG. 3 (transmission side) are given the<br>
reference numerals 12, 37, 38, ... used in FIG. 3 plus 100<br>
and thereby indicated as 112, 137, 138, ....<br><br>
 The above pilot signal Sp is transmitted after<br>
multiplexing with other transmission information in<br>
actual operations. This multiplexing method includes for<br>
example the following two schemes:<br>
 FIG. 16 is a view showing an example of first<br>
multiplexing of a pilot signal, and FIG. 17 is a view<br>
showing an example of second multiplexing of a pilot<br>
signal. Note that, in both figures, "P" represents the<br>
pilot signal Sp, "C" represents the already explained<br>
communication control information Ict, and "D" represents<br>
the already explained transmission data Du.<br>
	FIG. 16 shows that the pilot signal Sp is<br>
multiplexed along with the elapsed time, while FIG. 17<br>
shows that the pilot signal Sp is multiplexed along with<br>
both the elapsed time and the frequency.<br>
 FIG. 18 is a view showing an example of the<br>
dynamic change of the main band in the above-explained<br>
Embodiment 2 for easier understanding. Time elapses from<br>
the top toward the bottom in the present figure. Along<br>
with the elapse of time, the main band changes as for<br>
example "BAND 1" → "BAND 2" → "BAND 3" → "BAND 4"<br>
following the better propagation environment.<br>
 Thus, the base station multiplexes the signal<br>
for measuring the propagation environment (pilot) in all<br>
of the frequency bands used and transmits this as the<br>
control channel. Note that, in actual use, a case not<br>
including the transmission data Du is also assumed.<br>
Further, the pilot channel may be provided in place of<br>
the pilot signal Sp.<br>
 The terminal receives the pilot channel signals<br>
for all frequency bands (band 1 to band 4), measures the<br>
reception conditions and propagation environments, for<br>
example the SNR and CIR (carrier to interference ratio),<br>
calculates the above CQIs from the measurement values,<br>
and sequentially or simultaneously transmits the same to<br>
the base station for each band by using the uplink<br>
control channel. Note that it may also transmit the<br><br>
measurement results of the above CIR and SNR as they are.<br>
 The base station receives the uplink control<br>
channel signal and demodulates and decodes the CQIs. It<br>
selects the frequency band having the best CQI value from<br>
among the plurality of CQIs as the main band. It sends<br>
this selection result and the timing of change of the<br>
main band on the downlink control channel to the<br>
terminal.<br>
 The terminal receives this downlink control<br>
channel signal and demodulates and decodes this to<br>
extract the information of the used frequency band and<br>
timing of change. Then, at the timing of change, it<br>
changes the used frequency band. Note that the timing of<br>
change may be determined according to for example an<br>
absolute time or relative time or a slot unit. Further,<br>
it is also possible not to transmit the timing of change,<br>
but set it as after, e.g., 5 slots from the transmission<br>
of the downlink control channel signal etc. and thereby<br>
fix it for the system.<br>
 In the above description, the frequency band<br>
having the best propagation environment was selected as<br>
the main band, but a case where the best frequency band<br>
cannot be selected due to the situation of the other<br>
terminal may also be considered. In such case, the second<br>
best frequency band next to that may be selected.<br>
 Note that here the main band was selected by<br>
the base station, but the terminal may similarly select<br>
the frequency band having the best propagation<br>
environment and transmit this to the base station.<br>
 The SNRs, CIRs, etc. may be measured in the<br>
terminal simultaneously for all frequency bands as<br>
explained above or in a time division manner. Further, in<br>
a situation where bands having narrow frequency band<br>
widths continue, the propagation environment will not<br>
largely vary, therefore, in such case, only one frequency<br>
band need be measured. Further, the measurement value<br>
thereof may be made a mean value after measurement over a<br><br>
certain time.<br>
[0119] Further, in Embodiment 1, the extension band<br>
was explained by assuming transmission of only the<br>
transmission data Du, but to measure the propagation<br>
environment of each frequency band, in addition to the<br>
transmission data Du, a pilot channel or pilot signal may<br>
also be transmitted.<br>
[0120] The above explanation was given with reference<br>
to transmission from the base station to a terminal, but<br>
the present invention can similarly be conversely applied<br>
to transmission from a terminal to the base station.<br>
[0121] As already explained, in general, the<br>
transmission characteristic of the control channel must<br>
be better than the transmission characteristic of the<br>
data channel in transmission quality. Accordingly, for<br>
the main band including the control channel, it is<br>
necessary to select a frequency band having a good<br>
propagation environment. According to the above-explained<br>
operation, it becomes possible to select a frequency band<br>
under the best propagation environment as the main band.<br>
Further, even when the propagation environment changes<br>
along with the elapse of time, it becomes possible to<br>
always select the frequency band under the best<br>
propagation environment as the main band.<br>
[0122] Due to this, not only the transmission error of<br>
the control channel information is reduced, but also the<br>
hardware settings of the reception side become easy, and<br>
improvement of the transmission quality becomes possible.<br>
Further, it is also possible to reduce the number of<br>
times of data retransmission due to transmission error,<br>
therefore the transmission rate can be further increased.<br>
[0123] Further, the main band is variably set,<br>
therefore unbalance of the utilization situation (load)<br>
among frequency bands can be avoided and improvement of<br>
the frequency utilization efficiency can be achieved.<br>
[Embodiment 3: Dynamic change of extension band]<br>
Describing some characteristic features disclosed in<br><br>
the present Embodiment 3 first, they are as follows:<br>
 i) The frequency band set as an extension band<br>
among a plurality of frequency bands (band 1 to band 4)<br>
is made variable along with the elapse of time,<br>
ii) whether or not the propagation environment<br>
between communications apparatuses (10, 20) is good is<br>
judged, and the frequency band next to the frequency band<br>
having the best propagation environment among the above<br>
plurality of frequency bands is selected and set as the<br>
extension band.<br>
 iii) Further, the frequency band usable by the<br>
communications apparatuses (10, 20) is restricted at the<br>
time of establishment of the wireless channel, and the<br>
main band and the extension band are dynamically assigned<br>
within that restricted frequency band.<br>
 iv) Furthermore, the setting information of the<br>
frequency band to be set as the extension band is<br>
notified to the communications apparatus of the other<br>
party in advance for the extension,<br>
v) frequency band setting information concerning the<br>
frequency band for which extension is possible or change<br>
is possible is received from the communications apparatus<br>
of the other party, and the extension band or main band<br>
is changed by this, and<br>
vi) further, change timing information concerning<br>
the timing of the change is received.<br>
 vii) Further, the result of judgment as to<br>
whether or not the propagation environment is good is<br>
transmitted to the communications apparatus of the other<br>
party by using a control channel of a specific frequency<br>
band,<br>
viii) whether or not the propagation environment is<br>
good is judged using the result of detection of the<br>
transmission quality (CQI) returned in response to pilot<br>
channels or pilot signals transmitted between the<br>
communications apparatuses (10, 20),<br>
ix) based on at least one of the available frequency<br><br>
band of the related communications apparatus, the quality<br>
of the propagation environment at each frequency band,<br>
the usage situation of each frequency band, and the<br>
predetermined transmission rate of the data information<br>
(Du), the necessity of the setting or change of the<br>
extension band is judged, and<br>
x) at the time of new setting of the above extension<br>
band, the change of the frequency band is notified to the<br>
communications apparatus of the other party in advance.<br>

using the used frequency band of the terminal, the CQI of<br>

and timing of change,<br>
Step S61: change setting for each circuit unit at<br>
the timing of change, and<br>
Step S62: start reception operation by using<br>
extension band after that change.<br>
 In the present Embodiment 3, dynamic change of<br>
the extension band is explained. In general, at the time<br>
of the setting of a channel (time of establishment of<br>
wireless channel), the frequency band available by a<br>
terminal is transmitted from the terminal to the base<br>
station (or base station controller). This is the above-<br>
explained terminal available frequency band. Note that an<br>
explanation will be given by assuming a case where this<br>
available frequency band is notified, but it may also be<br>
considered not to perform such notification in a case<br>
where the available frequency band is previously<br>
determined in the communications system.<br>
 In the same way as the case of the above<br>
Embodiment 2, the base station transmits pilot signals<br>
Sp, and a terminal transmits the above CQIs calculated<br>
based on the received pilot signals Sp to the base<br>
station. Next, the base station considers the available<br>
frequency band of the terminal, the CQI of each frequency<br>
band transmitted from the terminal, the utilization<br>
situation of the other terminals, the predetermined<br><br>
transmission rate of the data Du to be transmitted, and<br>
so on and judges if the frequency band must be extended<br>
(used frequency band must be changed) for that terminal.<br>
 When extending is needed, the frequency band is<br>
selected. Further, the above timing of change when<br>
extending the used frequency band is selected. Then, the<br>
selection information of this extension band and the<br>
above timing of change are transmitted by using the<br>
control channel. The terminal receiving this control<br>
channel signal changes the setting of each circuit unit<br>
in the terminal based on the information for the<br>
extension band and the timing of change, then starts the<br>
reception by using that extension band.<br>
 This operation will be supplementally<br>
explained next. However, refer to the control flow of<br>
FIG. 21 explained before. First, the terminal transmits<br>
the frequency band useable by that terminal to the base<br>
station or its higher base station controller etc. The<br>
base station receiving this transmits pilot channel<br>
signals or pilot signals Sp by using that used frequency<br>
band. Note that when transmitting pilot channel signals<br>
using a common channel common to all terminals, the<br>
selection of the used frequency band is not needed.<br>
 The terminal receiving the pilot channel<br>
signals via the frequency bands calculates the above CQIs<br>
based on the above CIRs, SNR, etc., and transmits the CQI<br>
calculated values to the base station through the uplink<br>
control channel. The base station receiving these<br>
considers the CQIs, the utilization situations of the<br>
frequency bands, the predetermined transmission rate of<br>
the transmission data Du, and other QoS, selects the<br>
existence of the necessary for extension and the used<br>
frequency band in the case where the extension is carried<br>
out, determines the timing of change of the band, and<br>
notifies the information to the terminal via the downlink<br>
control channel.<br>
 The terminal receiving the information sets or<br><br>
re-sets each circuit unit of the terminal at the above<br>
timing of change and receives signals by using the<br>
extension band after the change at the above timing of<br>
change.<br>
 FIG. 22 is a view showing an example of the<br>
dynamic change of the extension band in the present<br>
Embodiment 3 for easier understanding. The elapse of time<br>
goes from the top toward the bottom in the present<br>
figure. As this elapse of time, the extension band is set<br>
as "BAND 2" → "band 2 + band 3 + band 4" exemplified in<br>
the figure whenever there is a necessity of extension<br>
while selecting a good frequency band next best to the<br>
frequency band having the best propagation environment.<br>
As in the latter case, the expansion band may be set by<br>
combining a plurality of bands.<br>
 In this way, the frequency band having a<br>
relatively good propagation environment can be selected<br>
as the extension band for a propagation environment<br>
changing along with the elapse of time. Due to this, the<br>
transmission error of the control channel information is<br>
reduced, the hardware setting of the reception side<br>
becomes easier, and the improvement of the transmission<br>
quality becomes possible. Further, the number of times of<br>
resending the data can be decreased, therefore the<br>
transmission rate can be enhanced. Further, if<br>
considering the processing time for correcting the<br>
settings on the reception side and notifying the change<br>
of the extension band to the other party in advance, the<br>
change of setting described above with respect to the<br>
apparatus becomes easier.<br>
[Embodiment 4: Dynamic change of main band and<br>
extension band]<br>
The characteristic features disclosed in the present<br>
Embodiment 4 will be shown below.<br>
 i) Both of the frequency band to be occupied as<br>
the main band among a plurality of frequency bands (band<br>
1 to band 4) and the frequency band to be occupied as an<br><br>
extension band among those plurality of frequency bands<br>
can be changed along with the elapse of time without<br>
overlap, and<br>
ii) further, one main band and at least one<br>
extension band are simultaneously changed.<br>
 FIG. 23 is a flow chart showing an example of<br>
changing both of the main band and an extension band.<br>
 In the present figure,<br>
Step S71: Transmit available frequency band.<br>
 Step S72: Receive available frequency band, and<br>
Step S73: transmit pilot channel signals using that<br>
available frequency band.<br>
	Step S74: Receive all pilot channel signals,<br>
calculate SNRs etc., and convert to CQIs, and<br>
Step S75: transmit above CQIs through uplink control<br>
channel.<br>
 Step S76: Receive above CQIs,<br>
Step S77: receive main band, that is, frequency band<br>
having best propagation environment,<br>
Step S78: further, select extension band, that is,<br>
frequency band having second best propagation<br>
environment,<br>
Step S7 9: transmit extended frequency band and its<br>
timing of change through downlink control channel, and<br>
Step S80: select timing of change thereof.<br>
 Step S81: Receive above extended frequency band<br>
and timing of change,<br>
Step S82: change setting for each circuit unit at<br>
the timing of change, and<br>
Step S83: start reception operation in extension<br>
band after that change.<br>
	Supplementing the explanation for the control<br>
flow of FIG. 23, here, it is assumed that each main band<br>
and each extension band are selected based on a<br>
predetermined transmission rate of the transmission data<br>
Du (see FIG. 24). The frequency band having the best<br>
propagation environment is selected as the main band<br><br>
based on the above CQIs of the frequency bands<br>
transmitted from the terminal. Then, the frequency band<br>
having the propagation improvement which next best to<br>
that (second) is selected as the extension band. Then,<br>
the timing of change is selected, and these are<br>
transmitted to the other party via the control channel.<br>
 The terminal receiving the used frequency band<br>
information (both of the main band and the extension<br>
band) and the change timing information changes the<br>
settings of the reception side circuit unit at this<br>
timing of change, then receives the two signals of the<br>
main band and the extension band.<br>
 FIG. 24 is a flow chart showing an example of<br>
the dynamic change of the main band and extension band in<br>
the present Embodiment 4 for easier understanding. The<br>
elapse of time goes from the top toward the bottom in the<br>
figure. Along with that the main band is set as "BAND 1"<br>
→ "BAND 1" → "BAND 3" → "BAND 2" as exemplified in the<br>
present figure, the extension band is set while forming a<br>
pair at either the left or right of the main band (on<br>
left side or right side in the present figure). Note, the<br>
two bands do not always have to form a pair. When looking<br>
at for example the third stage in the figure, there also<br>
exists a case where this extension band (band 4) does not<br>
exist, and when looking at for example the fourth stage<br>
in the figure, this extension band may not exist in the<br>
shown band 3, but may exist in the band 4 on the right<br>
adjacent to that with a space.<br>
 From the above description, it becomes possible<br>
to use the frequency bands with the best and second best<br>
propagation environments as the main band and the<br>
extension band. Further, even when the propagation<br>
environment changes along with time, it becomes possible<br>
to select the frequency bands having the best and second<br>
best propagation environments as the main band and the<br>
extension band.<br>
 Due to this, in the same way as the above<br><br>
embodiments, the transmission error of the control<br>
channel information is reduced, the hardware settings on<br>
the reception side become easier, and improvement of the<br>
transmission quality becomes possible. Further, the<br>
number of times of resending the data can be decreased,<br>
therefore the transmission rate can be improved. Further,<br>
by considering the processing time for correcting the<br>
settings on the reception side and notifying the change<br>
of the main band and the extension band to the other<br>
party in advance, the change of the hardware settings<br>
becomes easy.<br>
[Embodiment 5: Selection of main band and extension<br>
band according to propagation environment]<br>
First, the characteristic features disclosed in the<br>
present Embodiment 5 are shown below.<br>
 i) Judgment of whether or not the propagation<br>
environment between the communications apparatuses (10,<br>
20) is good is performed individually for each of a<br>
plurality of frequency bands (band 1 to band 4), the<br>
judgment result for each frequency band is individually<br>
transmitted to the communications apparatus of the other<br>
party,<br>
ii) the judgment of whether or not the propagation<br>
environment between the communications apparatuses (10,<br>
20) is good is performed individually for each of a<br>
plurality of frequency bands (band 1 to band 4), the<br>
judgment results for all frequency bands are multiplexed,<br>
and the multiplexed results are transmitted to the<br>
communications apparatus of the other party all together,<br>
and<br>
iii) the above judgment results are transmitted to<br>
the communications apparatus of the other party by using<br>
either the main band, extension band, or frequency band<br>
having a relatively good propagation environment.<br>
 In carrying out the present Embodiment 5, the<br>
already explained example of configuration of FIGS. 15A<br>
and 15B can be used or the example of configuration of<br><br>
FIG. 25 can be used.<br>
 FIG. 25 is a view showing an example of the<br>
hardware configuration on the return side of the response<br>
(CQI) information to the pilot signals. The example of<br>
configuration of the present figure is similar to the<br>
example of configuration of FIGS. 15A and 15B described<br>
above. The difference thereof resides in that individual<br>
processing linked with each of a plurality of frequency<br>
bands is carried out in FIG. 15B, but in the lower half<br>
in FIG. 25, CQIs for a plurality of frequency bands are<br>
multiplexed and processed all together. That is, in FIG.<br>
25, the transmission quality (CQI) is transmitted to the<br>
other party by one control channel. For this purpose, a<br>
multiplexing unit (Mux) 80 is introduced into the output<br>
side of the loop back path 77.<br>
 In the embodiments explained before, when<br>
transmitting the CQIs of the different frequency bands<br>
from a terminal to the base station, they may be<br>
transmitted through the uplink control channel for each<br>
frequency band or the CQIs for all frequency bands may be<br>
transmitted through the uplink control channel of for<br>
example the main band.<br>
 When transmitting the CQIs by using the uplink<br>
control channel for each frequency band, the example of<br>
configuration of FIGS. 15A and 15B is used. Note that, in<br>
the present example of configuration, no description is<br>
made of the uplink transmission data Du, but it is also<br>
possible to multiplex this data Du on the control channel<br>
and transmit the same. Further, the present example of<br>
configuration assumes a case where pilot channel signals<br>
are simultaneously received for a plurality of frequency<br>
bands.<br>
 In the terminal shown in FIG. 25, the signal of<br>
each frequency band is received and converted in<br>
frequency corresponding to that frequency band.<br>
Thereafter, the GI is eliminated at the GI elimination<br>
unit 54, a frequency-time transform is applied by the S/P<br><br>
unit 55, FFT unit 56, and P/S unit 57, then the result is<br>
demodulated at the demodulation unit 23. The propagation<br>
situation is.measured by the SNR, CIR, etc. using this<br>
demodulation signal, then the CQI value is calculated.<br>
 The above CQI value calculated for each<br>
frequency band is transmitted through the control channel<br>
of each frequency band. At this time, it is also possible<br>
to transmit the other control channel signal together.<br>
Further, it is also possible to transmit the same<br>
together with the uplink transmission data.<br>
	The calculated CQI enters into the part of FIG.<br>
15B by the loop back path 77, is encoded at the encoding<br>
unit 78, modulated at a modulation unit 112, then<br>
subjected to a time-frequency transform at an S/P unit<br>
137, an IFFT unit 138, and a P/S unit 139. Further, the<br>
GI is inserted at a GI insertion unit 140, then the<br>
result is converted to the corresponding frequency band<br>
and transmitted from the antenna AT.<br>
 From the above description, it becomes possible<br>
to transmit the CQI (propagation situation) of each<br>
frequency band to the base station in the same way as the<br>
embodiments explained before. Further, it becomes<br>
possible to select the frequency band having a good<br>
propagation environment as the main band based on the<br>
CQIs (propagation situations) sent from the terminal. In<br>
the same way, it becomes possible to select the frequency<br>
band having a relatively good propagation environment as<br>
the extension band. In this way, in the same way as the<br>
embodiments explained before, the transmission<br>
characteristics are improved by using the better<br>
frequency band, and the number of times of resending the<br>
data is decreased, therefore improvement of the<br>
transmission rate becomes possible.<br>
 Next, the example of configuration of FIG. 25<br>
described above is employed for a case of transmitting<br>
all CQIs by using the uplink control channel of a<br>
specific frequency band. In the same way as the case of<br><br>
using the uplink control channel for each frequency band<br>
explained above, the CQI in each frequency band is<br>
calculated. These calculation results are combined into<br>
one at the above multiplexing unit (Mux) 80, then this is<br>
encoded at the encoding unit 78. Further, it is modulated<br>
at the modulation unit 112, then subjected to a time-<br>
frequency transform at the S/P unit 137, IFFT unit 138,<br>
and P/S unit 139 and given a GI at the GI insertion unit<br>
140. Thereafter, the result is converted in frequency by<br>
the circuits 141 and 142 and transmitted from the antenna<br>
AT.<br>
 Note that, as the frequency band used for the<br>
transmission of the CQI to be used, the main band which<br>
is selected because of its relatively good transmission<br>
environment may be selected, the frequency band having<br>
the best propagation environment (best CQI) may be<br>
selected, and another frequency band may be selected.<br>
Further, the frequency band previously set as the<br>
communications system may be used.<br>
 From the above description, in the same way as<br>
the embodiments explained before, it becomes possible to<br>
transmit the CQI (propagation situation) of each<br>
frequency band to the base station. Further, it becomes<br>
possible to select the frequency band having a good<br>
propagation environment as the main band based on the CQI<br>
(propagation situation) sent from the terminal. In the<br>
same way, it becomes possible to select the frequency<br>
band having a good propagation environment as the<br>
extension band. By selecting the better frequency band in<br>
this way, the transmission characteristics are improved,<br>
the number of times of resending the data is decreased,<br>
and therefore improvement of the transmission rate<br>
becomes possible.<br>
[Embodiment 6: High efficiency transmission of used<br>
frequency band information]<br>
The characteristic feature disclosed in the present<br>
Embodiment 6 is that, for each of a plurality of<br><br>
frequency bands (band 1 to band 4), at least one of<br>
information (i to iv) of (i) a frequency band<br>
identification number, (ii) used/not yet used as main<br>
band, (iii) used/not yet used as extension band, and (iv)<br>
current status maintained is encoded and transmitted to<br>
the communications apparatus of the other party.<br>
 FIG. 26 is a view showing tables for explaining<br>
the high efficiency transmission of the used frequency<br>
band information. Table 1 shows an example of<br>
correspondence of the used frequency band and band<br>
number, and Table 2 and Table 3 show a first example and<br>
a second example of the method of setting of used/not yet<br>
used of the used frequency band.<br>
 In the transmission of the above used frequency<br>
band information in the embodiments explained above, for<br>
example, by assigning numbers to frequency bands and<br>
transmitting the numbers, the amount of control channel<br>
information can be reduced in comparison with the case<br>
where the value of frequency per se is transmitted. A<br>
concrete example will be explained by using the above<br>
Table 1 to Table 3. Note that, here, an example where the<br>
frequency band useable by the communications system as a<br>
whole is set to 800 MHz to 820 MHz and this is divided<br>
into four frequency bands as in FIG. 9 for use is shown.<br>
 First, band numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) are assigned<br>
to the bands as shown in Table 1. Further, which<br>
frequency band is to be used as the main band, and which<br>
frequency band is to be used (or not used) as the<br>
extension band is set as in Table 2.<br>
 At this time, in for example a case where the<br>
band 1 is "not yet used", the band 2 is used as the "main<br>
band", the band 3 is used as the "extension band", and<br>
the band 4 is "not yet used", the following control data<br>
"yyllOOzz" is obtained wherein yy and zz are "01" or<br>
"10".<br>
 Note that, here, the above control data was<br>
prepared in a sequence of band 1, band 2, band 3, and<br><br>
band 4, but this sequence may be any so far as<br>
recognition is possible on the transmission side and the<br>
reception side. Further, the number of bands can be<br>
freely increased or decreased. Further, an explanation<br>
was given here by taking as an example four consecutive<br>
frequency bands, but nonconsecutive frequency bands<br>
having not yet used bands in the middle may also be<br>
employed.<br>
 As described above, by encoding information<br>
(forming tables), the amount of information can be<br>
reduced in comparison with for example the case where the<br>
value of the center frequency of the band per is<br>
transmitted.<br>
 Further, as shown in Table 3, it is also<br>
possible to provide settings in the case where there is<br>
no change in the usage situation, that is, the case of<br>
"current status maintained".<br>
 By encoding (forming tables) the used frequency<br>
band information as described above, the data length of<br>
the control signal can be compressed. Accordingly, the<br>
ratio of the transmission data and the control channel<br>
information is reduced for the latter, and accordingly<br>
the transmission efficiency of the transmission data is<br>
improved.<br>
[Embodiment 7: Continuous setting and nonconsecutive<br>
setting of extension bands]<br>
First, when describing the characteristic features<br>
disclosed in the present Embodiment 7, they are as<br>
follows.<br>
 i) One extension band or two or more<br>
consecutive extension bands are assigned as the frequency<br>
bands consecutive to the main band on the frequency axis,<br>
ii) or an isolated extension band not consecutive<br>
with any of the extension bands is further included on<br>
the above frequency axis, and<br>
iii) a signal having no meaning is inserted in the<br>
not yet used frequency band accompanying the above<br><br>
isolated extension band and transmitted to the<br>
communications apparatus of the other party. Note that as<br>
views representing the present Embodiment 7, there are<br>
FIG. 27 and the already explained FIG. 22.<br>
 FIG. 27 is a view showing an example of dynamic<br>
change of the extension band. In contrast to the above<br>
FIG. 22 showing the case where consecutive extension<br>
bands are selected, FIG. 27 shows a case nonconsecutive<br>
extension bands (see the fourth stage of the same<br>
diagram) are selected. Note that the method of viewing<br>
FIG. 27 is exactly the same as the method of viewing the<br>
above FIG. 22. This will be concretely explained below.<br>
 First explaining the case where the extension<br>
bands are consecutive, the already explained FIG. 22<br>
shows a case where the extension bands are consecutively<br>
selected. Note as one example, a case where a consecutive<br>
band forming a pair with the main band is selected as the<br>
extension band. In the mode of this FIG. 22, the<br>
extension band is consecutive with the main band,<br>
therefore, in comparison with the case of nonconsecutive<br>
bands (FIG. 27), the signal processing becomes simpler.<br>
Note that the transmission operation and the reception<br>
operation are the same as those explained in the above<br>
embodiments.<br>
 On the other hand, FIG. 27, as described above,<br>
also shows a case where an extension band is<br>
nonconsecutive (fourth stage). In this way, it is also<br>
possible to nonconsecutively select an extension band<br>
with respect to the main band or an adjacent extension<br>
band from the used frequency band of the terminal, the<br>
propagation environment, and the balance with other<br>
terminals.<br>
 Note that a subcarrier bridging the consecutive<br>
frequency bands (see a dotted line SC of FIG. 22) is not<br>
set in the explanation hitherto, but according to the<br>
usage situation of the other terminals, it is also<br>
possible to set a subcarrier bridging two frequency bands<br><br>
and increase the amount of transmission information by<br>
that amount.<br>
 Further, the reception side terminal does not<br>
receive signals at the above nonconsecutive frequency<br>
bands or forcibly processes the related signals as<br>
meaningless signals. Due to this, even when the extension<br>
bands are non consecutive, reception can be carried out<br>
without problem.<br>
 As described above, by setting nonconsecutive<br>
extension bands, it becomes possible to flexibly select<br>
the extension bands considering the used frequency band<br>
of the terminal, the propagation environment, and the<br>
usage situation of the other terminals. Further, due to<br>
this, the efficiency of frequency utilization is further<br>
improved.<br>
[Embodiment 8: Making number of subcarriers in each<br>
frequency band constant]<br>
The characteristic feature disclosed in the present<br>
Embodiment 8 resides in that the bandwidth of each of a<br>
plurality of frequency bands (band 1 to band 4) is set to<br>
a predetermined constant value and the number of the<br>
series of subcarriers in each band is made a<br>
predetermined constant value.<br>
	FIG. 28 is a view showing a first example of a<br>
band extension pattern, FIG. 29 is a view showing a<br>
second example of a band extension pattern, and FIG. 30<br>
is a view showing a third example of a band extension<br>
pattern.<br>
 Note that the method of viewing these FIG. 28<br>
to FIG. 30 is substantially the same as the method of<br>
viewing the above FIG. 22, FIG. 24, FIG. 27, etc. While<br>
FIG. 22, FIG. 24, FIG. 27, etc. show patterns using<br>
actual waveforms, FIG. 28 to FIG. 30 only show patterns<br>
as blocks of subcarriers in place of such actual<br>
waveforms. This is for facilitating the explanation of<br>
the present Embodiment 8. Namely, they show the concept<br>
of a "frequency band unit" visually for easier<br><br>
understanding. Note that terms described in FIG. 28 to<br>
FIG. 30 are already explained except a "processing<br>
delay". This processing delay, when viewing for example<br>
FIG. 4, means a time delay required for the processing<br>
from when the used frequency band information If is input<br>
to the used frequency band setting unit 25 to when the<br>
band set instruction signal Sb is generated and further<br>
the parameters finish being set in each circuit part.<br>
 In general, in the multicarrier transmission<br>
mode (OFDM, MC-CDMA etc.) or other communication system<br>
using a series of subcarriers, when changing the<br>
bandwidth, ordinarily the change is carried out in units<br>
of subcarriers. In this case, used/not yet used must be<br>
set in unit of subcarriers. Further, in the sending<br>
processing and receiving processing, signal processing<br>
considering "used/not yet used" in unit of subcarriers is<br>
necessary, so the setting of bands is liable to become<br>
troublesome and complex. Further, in a case where the<br>
users are multiplexed, control of used/not yet used of<br>
each subcarrier is necessary between users. As a result,<br>
a drop in the efficiency of frequency utilization is<br>
caused.<br>
 Therefore, in the present Embodiment 8, the<br>
used frequency band of the communications system as a<br>
whole is divided into a plurality of bands (band 1 to<br>
band 4), the "number of subcarriers is made constant" in<br>
the divided frequency bands, and transmission between<br>
communications apparatuses is carried out by using one or<br>
more of the frequency bands. Due to this, an improvement<br>
of the efficiency of frequency utilization can be<br>
achieved.<br>
 Specifically, for example one frequency band is<br>
set to 5 MHz, and the number of subcarriers in that<br>
frequency band is set to 25. By setting a plurality of<br>
such frequency bands, the above used frequency band is<br>
made variable in units of frequency bands. The above FIG.<br>
28 to FIG. 30 show concrete examples of band extension in<br><br>
units of bands. An abscissa in each diagram indicates the<br>
bandwidth, one hatched block represents one frequency<br>
band, and a plurality of subcarriers are assumed to be<br>
contained in that one frequency band. In the same way as<br>
FIG. 9, it may be considered that the band 1, band 2,<br>
band 3, and band 4 are arranged from the left.<br>
 FIG. 28 shows a case where the band 1 is used<br>
as the main band, and FIG. 29 shows a case where the band<br>
2 is used as the main band. Further, FIG. 30 shows an<br>
example of changing the setting of the extension band<br>
along with the elapse of time and shows a case where<br>
those extension bands include a nonconsecutive one (see<br>
the sixth stage). Note that the concrete operation of<br>
transmission/reception is as explained in the above<br>
embodiments.<br>
	From the above description, the used frequency<br>
band can be easily made variable, and it becomes possible<br>
to raise the utilization efficiency of the frequency.<br>
Further, when compared with the case where the used<br>
frequency band is made variable in units of subcarriers,<br>
the above transmission/reception operation becomes<br>
further simpler, and the configuration of a<br>
transmitter/receiver becomes simpler.<br>
[Embodiment 9: Making both number of subcarriers and<br>
subcarrier bandwidth in each frequency band constant]<br>
Describing characteristic features disclosed in the<br>
present Embodiment 9, they are as follows:<br>
 i) The bandwidth of each of the plurality of<br>
frequency bands (band 1 to band 4) is made a<br>
predetermined constant value, and the bandwidth of each<br>
subcarrier in each band is made a predetermined constant<br>
value, and<br>
ii) further, also the number of subcarriers is made<br>
a predetermined constant value. Due to this, the main<br>
band and the extension band can be easily set in units of<br>
frequency bands.<br>
 In the above Embodiment 8, the number of<br><br>
subcarriers per band was made constant, but in the<br>
present Embodiment 9, the bandwidth of each subcarrier is<br>
also made constant.<br>
 As a result of this, the difference between<br>
bands becomes only the center frequency of each. Due to<br>
this, baseband signal processing is made uniform<br>
irrespective of the frequency band, and, when compared<br>
with Embodiment 8, the configuration of the<br>
transmitter/receiver becomes further simpler.<br>
[Embodiment 10: Setting of band based on difference<br>
between predetermined transmission rate and real<br>
transmission rate]<br>
Describing the characteristic features disclosed in<br>
the present Embodiment 10, they are as follows:<br>
 i) In order to judge necessity/unnecessity of<br>
an extension band, the difference between a predetermined<br>
transmission rate S1 assumed to be necessary for the<br>
exchange of information and an actual transmission rate<br>
S2 which is actually achieved (S1 - S2) is calculated. It<br>
is judged whether the extension band is required or not<br>
required in accordance with the positive or negative sign<br>
of this difference, and<br>
ii) here, the above actual transmission rate is<br>
found from the number of the transmission data<br>
information calculated from the number of used frequency<br>
bands and the transmission interval of the transmission<br>
data information.<br>
 FIG. 31 is a view showing an example of the<br>
configuration of the communications apparatus<br>
(transmission side) according to Embodiment 10, and FIG.<br>
32 is a flow chart showing an example of the operation in<br>
the apparatus of FIG. 31.<br>
 Referring to FIG. 31 first, the figure is<br>
substantially the same as the configuration of the above<br>
FIG. 5 (also FIG. 3 is the same), but differs in the<br>
point that a frequency band selecting/setting unit 85<br>
(modification of 15) and an actual transmission rate<br><br>
calculation unit 86 shown on the left end in the figure<br>
are introduced.<br>
[0203] Further, referring to FIG. 32, the operation<br>
thereof is:<br>
Step S91: Confirm predetermined transmission rate,<br>
Step S92: confirm amount of transmission data, and<br>
Step S93: calculate actual transmission rate.<br>
[0204] Step S994: Judge whether or not it is necessary<br>
to extend used frequency band based on rate values in<br>
steps S91 and S93 and judge that it is necessary.<br>
[0205] Step S95: Select extended frequency band and<br>
determine timing of change, and<br>
Step S96: transmit that extended frequency band and<br>
its timing of change through downlink control channel.<br>
[0206] Step S97: Receive extended frequency band and<br>
timing of change,<br>
Step S98: change setting of each circuit unit at<br>
that timing of change, and<br>
Step S99: start reception by using extension band<br>
after change.<br>
[0207] Explaining this further concretely, in the<br>
above Embodiment 1, used/not yet used of the extension<br>
band and the number of extension bands were determined<br>
based on only the predetermined transmission rate, but in<br>
the present Embodiment 8, the extension or reduction of<br>
the band is carried out by considering the difference<br>
between the actual transmission rate and the<br>
predetermined transmission rate.<br>
[0208] A concrete example will be explained by using<br>
FIG. 31 and FIG. 32 again. Note that the explanation will<br>
be omitted for the same parts as those in Embodiment 1.<br>
[0209] Assume that a predetermined transmission rate<br>
Rd of a certain transmission data Du is 10 Mbps, and the<br>
transmission is carried out by using the main band and<br>
the extension band. At this time, from the number of<br>
transmission data calculated from the number of used<br>
frequency bands and the transmission interval thereof, an<br><br>
actual transmission rate Ra can be calculated by an<br>
actual transmission rate calculation unit 86 of FIG. 31.<br>
This actual transmission rate Ra and the predetermined<br>
transmission rate Rd are compared at the above<br>
selecting/setting unit 85. When the actual transmission<br>
rate Ra is lower, the used frequency band is increased<br>
(extended). Further, for example, when is judged that the<br>
predetermined transmission rate Rd can be secured even<br>
when the actual transmission rate Ra is much higher than<br>
the predetermined transmission rate Rd and the used<br>
frequency band is decreased, the used frequency band is<br>
decreased (reduced).<br>
 From the above description, an improvement of<br>
the efficiency of frequency utilization can be achieved<br>
while satisfying the predetermined transmission rate.<br>
Note that, other than the above method, it is also<br>
possible to ask the base station to return whether or not<br>
the data transmitted from the base station could be<br>
transmitted to the terminal (ACK/NACK), calculate the<br>
actual transmission rate based on that, and make the used<br>
frequency band variable. Further, it is also possible to<br>
calculate the transmission rate based on the amount of<br>
data transmitted from the base station to the terminal,<br>
ask the terminal to return this transmission rate value<br>
to the base station, and make the used frequency band<br>
variable based on that value.<br>
[Embodiment 11: Enlargement of used frequency band]<br>
FIG. 33 is a view for explaining the present<br>
Embodiment 11. The parts to be particularly noted are a<br>
"restricted band" and a "overall frequency band after<br>
lifting restriction". Here, the characteristic features<br>
disclosed in the present Embodiment 11 are as described<br>
below:<br>
 i) In a communications system for exchange of<br>
information between communications apparatuses (10, 20)<br>
by the multicarrier transmission mode using a series of<br>
subcarriers, in a case where the usage of only a part of<br><br>
the divided frequency bands ("band a") is permitted at<br>
present among a plurality of divided frequency bands<br>
(band a to band d) formed by dividing the overall<br>
frequency band to be assigned to this communications<br>
system in the future (see "overall frequency band after<br>
lifting restriction" of FIG. 33) (see "restricted band"),<br>
that divided frequency band "band a" allowed to be used<br>
is operated further divided into one or more frequency<br>
bands (like band 1 to band 4 in Embodiments 1 to 10). At<br>
the same time, each of the other divided frequency bands<br>
which are restricted at present (band b, band c, and band<br>
d) is divided into one or more frequency bands in the<br>
same way as the former (like band 1 to band 4 in<br>
Embodiments 1 to 10) in advance. Then, when the<br>
restriction is lifted in the future, each of the<br>
plurality of divided frequency bands (band b to band d)<br>
which are formed by dividing the overall frequency band<br>
but not yet used at present is immediately operated by<br>
the same operation as the operation of dividing the<br>
divided frequency band (band a) allowed to be used at<br>
present into one or more frequency bands, and<br>
ii) here, the plurality of frequency bands (band a<br>
to band d) formed by dividing the overall frequency band<br>
have constant bandwidths with respect to each other, and<br>
the number and bandwidth of subcarriers in each of those<br>
divided frequency bands have constant values with respect<br>
to each other.<br>
 Explaining this further concretely, there may<br>
be cases where frequency band usable by the present<br>
communications system (or base station) is restricted<br>
from the balance with other communications system but<br>
later the restriction is lifted for a reason that the<br>
frequency used by the other communications system is<br>
shifted elsewhere and so on.<br>
 When assuming such case, the above limited used<br>
frequency band ("limited band a") is operated by dividing<br>
the band (a) into one or more frequency bands in the same<br><br>
way as the above embodiments. Then, at this time, the<br>
restricted frequency bands (band b, band c, and band d)<br>
are individually divided to one or more frequency bands<br>
as well. Note that preferably the used frequency band<br>
(band a) and restricted frequency bands (bands b to d)<br>
are divided with the same bandwidth. FIG. 33 assumes<br>
division with the same bandwidth in this way. Further, in<br>
FIG. 33, the used frequency band is limited to the "band<br>
a" which is operated as a single frequency band. The<br>
whole restricted frequency band is divided into three<br>
bands (band b to band d), but these bands b to d can not<br>
be used at present due to the restrictions. Note that the<br>
number of subcarriers and the subcarrier bandwidth of<br>
each of these bands are constant.<br>
 Note that, while restricted, the frequency band<br>
is set as a single band (band a), therefore the used<br>
frequency band cannot be extended. According to the<br>
present Embodiment 11, after the lifting of the<br>
restriction described above, the number of used frequency<br>
bands becomes four (bands a to d), and the operation can<br>
be immediately shift to the operation of the embodiments<br>
explained before.<br>
 By setting the frequency band as described<br>
above, the used frequency band is limited at present, but<br>
when the restriction is lifted after that, the operation<br>
can be immediately shifted to the system operation<br>
according to the present invention. This enables the<br>
flexible operation of the communications system.<br>
 As explained in detail above, according to the<br>
present invention, it becomes possible to easily make the<br>
used frequency bandwidth variable, and due to this, the<br>
utilization efficiency of the frequency can be much<br>
enhanced.<br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TITLE: 'A COMMUNICATION APPARATUS AND A METHOD IN A<br>
COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM FOR EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION<br>
BETWEEN COMMUNICATIONS APPARATUSES'<br>
The invention relates to a communications system for communications by a<br>
multicarrier transmission mode between a plurality of communications<br>
apparatuses (10, 20) wherein an overall frequency band assigned to the<br>
communications system is divided into a plurality of frequency bands each<br>
having a constant bandwidth (for example band 1 to band 4) and a specific band<br>
(for example band 1) among these divided bands is used to transmit used<br>
frequency band information and thereby determine the assignment of the<br>
remaining bands (band 2 to band 4) to be used between said communications<br>
apparatuses. Here, the specific band is defined as a main band for transmitting<br>
control channel information including said used frequency band information and<br>
also data channel information. The main band may also be added with an<br>
extension band for transmitting further data channel information. Further, the<br>
main band and extension band can be changed in the frequency band used<br>
along with time or can be changed in the number thereof. Both of the main band<br>
and the extension bands are preferably used by multiplexing by some of<br>
communications apparatuses.</td>
