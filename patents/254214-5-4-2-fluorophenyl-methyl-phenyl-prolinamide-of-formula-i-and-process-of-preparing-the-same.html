				<td>'The present invention relates to 5-(4-{[(2-fluorophenyl)methyl]oxy}phenyl)-prolinamide of formula (I) and composition thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to an Î±-aminocarboxyamide derivative, salts and prodrugs thereof, and to the use of this derivative, salts and prodrugs thereof in treating diseases and conditions mediated by modulation of use-dependent voltage-gated sodium channels, In addition, the Invention relates to compositions containing this derivative, salts and prodrugs thereof, and processes for their preparation.<br>
Voltage-galed sodium channels are responsible for the initial phase of the action potential, which is a wave of electrical depolarisation usually initiated at the soma of the neuron and propagated along the nerve axon to the terminals. At the terminals, the action potential triggers the influx of calcium and the release of neurotransmitter. Drugs, such as lidocaine, that block voltage-gated sodium channels are used as local anaesthetics. Other sodium channel blockers, such as lamotrigine and carbamazepine are used to treat epilepsy, in the latter case, partial inhibition of voltage-gated sodium channels reduces neuronal excitability and reduces seizure propagation. In the case of local anaesthetics, regional block of sodium channels on sensory neurons prevents the conduction of painful stimuli. A key feature of these drugs is their use-dependent mechanism of action. The drugs are thought to stabilise an inactivated configuration of the channel that is adopted rapidly after the channel opens. This inactivated state provides a refractory period before the channel returns to its resting (closed) state ready to be reactivated. As a result, use-dependent sodium channel blockers retard the firing of neurons at high frequency, for example in response to painful stimuli, and with help to prevent repetitive firing during periods of prolonged neuronal depoiarisation that might occur, for example, during a seizure. Action potentials triggered at low frequencies, for example in the heart, will not be significantly affected by these drugs, although the safety margin differs in each case, since at high enough concentrations each of these drugs is capable of blocking the resting or open states of the channels.<br>
The voltage-gated sodium channel family is made up of 10 subtypes, four of which are brain specific, NaV1.1, 1.2,1.3 and 1.6. Of the other subtypes. NaV1.4 is found only in skeletal muscle, NaV1.5 Is specific to cardiac muscle, and NaV1.7,1.8, and 1.9 are found predominantly In sensory neurons. The hypothesised binding site for use-dependent sodium channel blockers is highly conserved between all the subtypes, As a result, drugs such as lidocalne, lamotrigine and carbamazepine do<br>
not distinguish between the subtypes. However, selectivity can be achieved as a result of the different frequencies at which the channels normally operate.<br>
Drugs that block voltage-gated sodium channels in a use-dependent manner are also used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, either to reduce symptoms of mania or depression, or as mood stabilisers to prevent the emergence of mood episodes. Clinical and preclinical evidence also suggests that use-dependent sodium channel blockers may help to reduce the symptoms of schizophrenia. For example, lamotrigine has been shown to reduce symptoms of psychosis induced by ketamine in healthy human volunteers, and furthermore, studies in patients suggest that the drug can augment the antipsychotic efficacy of some atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as clozapine or olanzapine. It is hypothesised that efficacy in these psychiatric disorders may result in part from a reduction of excessive glutamate release. The reduction in glutamate release is thought to be a consequence of use-dependent sodium channel inhibition in key brain areas, such as the frontal cortex. However, interaction with voltage-gated calcium channels may also contribute to the efficacy of these drugs.<br>

The diastereoisomers of the compound of formula (I) may be obtained according to methods well known in the literature, for example by preparative HPLC or by chromatographic purifications. A racemic mixture may either be separated using preparative HPLC and a column with a chiral stationary phase or resolved to yield individual enantiomers utilising methods known to those skilled in the art. In addition, chiral intermediate compounds may be resolved and used to prepare chira) compounds of the invention.<br>
The compound of formula (I) may form pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts. The pharmaceutically or veterinarily acceptable salts of the compound of formula (I) which contain a basic centre are, for example, non-toxic acid addition salts formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfuric and phosphoric acid, with carboxylic acids or with organo-sulfonic acids. Examples include the HCI, HBr, HI, sulfate or bisulfate, nitrate, phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, acetate, benzoate, succinate, saccharate, fumarate, maleate, lactate, citrate, tartrate, gluconate, camsylate, methanesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, benzenesulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate and pamoate salts. For reviews on suitable pharmaceutical salts see Berge et a/. J. Pharm, Sci., 66, 1-19, 1977; P L Gould, International Journal of Pharmaceutics, 33 (1986), 201-217; and Bighley ef a/, Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, Marcel Dekker Inc. New York 1996, Volume 13, page 453-497.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain protected derivatives of the compounds of formula (I), which may be made prior to a final deprotection stage, may not possess pharmacological activity as such, but may, in certain instances, be administered orally or parenterally and thereafter metabolised in the body to form compounds of the invention which are pharmacologically active. Such derivatives may therefore be described as "prodrugs". All such prodrugs of compounds of the invention are included within the scope of the invention. Examples of pro-drug functionality suitable for the compounds of the present invention are described in Drugs of Today, Volume 19, Number 9, 1983, pp 499 - 538 and in Topics in Chemistry, Chapter 31, pp 306 - 316 and in "Design of Prodrugs" by H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985, Chapter 1 (the disclosures in which documents are incorporated herein by reference). It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art, that certain moieties, known to those skilled in the art as "pro-moieties", for example as described by H. Bundgaard in "Design of Prodrugs" (the disclosure in which document is incorporated herein by reference) may be placed on appropriate functionalities when such functionalities are present within compounds of the invention.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvates". For example, a complex with water is known as a "hydrate*. Pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of the compound of the invention are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable solvates of the compounds of the invention include hydrates thereof.<br>
Also included within the scope of the compounds of the invention are polymorphs thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in one or more tautomeric forms. All tautomers and mixtures thereof are included in the scope of the present invention.<br>
The invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of a compound of the invention. An isotopic variation of a compound of the invention is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but<br>
an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 31P, 32P, MS, 18F and 39CI, respectively. Certain isotopic variations of the invention, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., 14C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isotopic variations of the compounds of the invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures such as by the illustrative methods or by the preparations described in the Examples hereafter using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
According to a further aspect, the invention provides a process to prepare a compound of formula (I) comprising the reaction of a compound of formula (II)<br>
(Formula Removed)  with a solution of ammonia in a suitable solvent.<br>
In one embodiment, the solvent is methanol. In a further embodiment the solution of ammonia in methanol is concentrated, for example a 7N or 11.2 M solution.<br>
In another embodiment the reaction is performed at room temperature.<br>
As discussed hereinabove, it is believed that compounds of the invention may be useful for the treatment of diseases and conditions mediated by modulation of voltage-gated sodium channels.<br>
Therefore, according to a further aspect, the invention provides compounds of the invention for use as a medicament, preferably a human medicament.<br>

Compounds of the invention may be useful in the treatment of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain syndromes can develop following neuronal injury and the resulting pain may persist for months or years, even after the original injury has healed. Neuronal injury may occur in the peripheral nerves, dorsal roots, spinal cord or certain regions in the brain. Neuropathic pain syndromes are traditionally classified according to the disease or event that precipitated them. Neuropathic pain syndromes include: diabetic neuropathy; sciatica; non-specific lower back pain; multiple sclerosis pain; fibromyalgia; HIV-related neuropathy; post-herpetic neuralgia; trigeminal neuralgia; and pain resulting from physical trauma, amputation, cancer, toxins or chronic inflammatory conditions. These conditions are difficult to treat and although several drugs are known to have limited efficacy, complete pain control is rarely achieved. The symptoms of neuropathic pain are incredibly heterogeneous and are often described as spontaneous shooting and lancinating pain, or ongoing, burning pain. In addition, there is pain associated with normally non-painful sensations such as "pins and needles" (paraesthesias and dysesthesias), increased sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia), painful sensation following innocuous stimulation (dynamic, static or thermal allodynia), increased sensitivity to noxious stimuli (thermal, cold, mechanical hyperalgesia), continuing pain sensation after removal of the stimulation (hyperpathia) or an absence of or deficit in selective sensory pathways (hypoalgesia).<br>

EtOAc (6ml) was added to (5R)-5-(4-{[(2-Fluorophenyl)methyl]oxy}phenyl)-L-prolinamide (E1, 300 mg) and this was heated at 60Â°C for an hour to dissolve the compound. Then methanesulfontc acid (65Âµl, 1.05 eq) was added to the solution and as soon as the acid was added, the solution went cloudy. This was then left to temperature cycle (0-40'C) for 2 days. The compound was isolated by filtration as a<br>
white solid, washed with EtOAc and dried in vacua at 40"C overweek-end to afford 335 mg of the title compound.<br>
Melting point: 192Â°C.<br>
Biological Assay<br>
The ability of the compounds of the invention to modulate the voltage-gated sodium<br>
channel subtype NaV 1.3 may be determined by the following assay.<br>
Cell biology<br>
Stable cell lines expressing hNaV1.3 channels were created by transfecting CHO cells with the pCIN5-hNavl.3 vector using the lipofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection method. pCINS is a bicistronic vector for the creation of mammalian cell lines that predisposes all neomycin resistant cells to express recombinant protein (see Rees S., Coote J., Stable J., Goodson S., Harris S. &amp; Lee M.G. (1996) Biotechniques, 20, 102-112) by virtue of the recombinant cDNA being linked to the neomycin-selectable marker cDNA downstream of the CMV promoter (for full details see Chen YH, Dale TJ, Romanes MA, Whitaker WR, Xie XM, Clare JJ. Cloning, distribution and functional analysis of the type 111 sodium channel from human brain Eur J Neurosci, 2000 Dec;12, 4281-9). Cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) containing, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% L-glutamine, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin (Invitrogen), 1% non-essential amino acids, 2% H-T supplement and 1% G418 (Invitrogen) and maintained at 37Â°C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2 in air. Cells were liberated from the T175 culture flask for passage and harvesting using Versene (Invitrogen).<br>
Cell preparation<br>
Cells were grown to 60-95% confluence in a T75 flask. Cells were lifted by removing the growth media and incubating with 1.5 ml of warmed (37Â°C) Versene (Invitrogen, 15040-066) for 6 min. Lifted cells were suspended in 10 ml of PBS (Invitrogen, 14040-133). Cell suspension was then placed into a 10-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 2 min at 700 rpm. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed and the cell pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of PBS.<br>
Electrophysiology<br>
Currents were recorded at room temperature (21-23Â°C) using the lonWorksHT planar array electrophysiology technology (Molecular Devices Corp.). Stimulation protocols and data acquisition were carried out using a microcomputer (Dell Pentium 4). In order to determine planar electrode hole resistances (Rp), a 10 mV, 160 ms potential difference was applied across each hole. These measurements were performed before cell addition. After cell addition a seal test was performed prior to antibiotic (amphotericin) circulation to achieve intracellular access. Leak subtraction was conducted in all experiments by applying a 160 ms hyperpolarizing (10 mV) prepulse 200 ms before the test pulses to measure leak conductance. Test pulses stepping from the holding potential of -90 mV to 0 mV were applied for 20 ms and repeated 10 times at a frequency of 10 Hz. In all experiments, the test pulse protocol was performed in the absence (pre-read) and presence (post-read) of a compound. Pre- and post-reads were separated by a compound addition followed by a 3-3.5 min incubation.<br>
Solutions and drugs<br>
The intracellular solution contained the following (in mM): K-gluconate 100, KCI 40mM, MgCI2 3.2, EGTA 3, HEPES 5, adjusted to pH 7.25. Amphotericin was prepared as 30 mg/ml stock solution and diluted to a final working concentration of 0.1 mg/ml in internal buffer solution. The external solution was Dulbecco's PBS (Invitrogen) and contained the following (in mM]: CaCI2 0.90, KCI 2.67, K3PO4 1.47, MgCI2 0.50, NaCI 138, Na3PO4 8.10, with a pH of 7.4. Compounds were prepared in DMSO as 10mM stock solutions and subsequent 1:3 serial dilutions performed. Finally the compounds were diluted 1:100 in external solution resulting in a final DMSO concentration of 1%.<br>
Data analysis<br>
The recordings were analysed and filtered using both seal resistance (&gt;40 Mï) and peak current amplitude (&gt;200pA) in the absence of compound to eliminate unsuitable cells from further analysis. Paired comparisons between pre-drug and post-drug additions were used to determine the inhibitory effect of each compound. The concentrations of compounds required to inhibit current elicited by the 1st depolarising pulse by 50% (tonic pIC50) were determined by fitting of the Hill equation to the concentration response data. In addition the use-dependent inhibitory properties of the compounds were determined by assessing the effect of compounds on the 10* versus 1" depolarising pulse. The ratio of the 10th over 1st<br>
pulse was calculated in the absence and presence of drug and the % use-dependent inhibition calculated. The data was fitted using the same equation as for the tonic plC50 and the concentration producing 15% inhibition (use-dependent pUD15) calculated.<br>
The compounds of examples 2 to 5 were tested in the above assay and gave pUO15 values greater than 5.0.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
