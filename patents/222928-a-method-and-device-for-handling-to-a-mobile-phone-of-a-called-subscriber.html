				<td>A METHOD AND DEVICE FOR HANDLING A TELEPHONE<br>
CALL FROM A CALLING SUBSCRIBER TO A MOBILE<br>
PHONE OF A CALLED SUBSCRIBER<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and device for handling a telephone<br>
call from a calling subscriber to a mobile phone of a called subscriber, and more<br>
particularly, it relates to a telecommunication service through a cellular radio mobile<br>
network, which allows a subscriber to acquire the telephone number of the<br>
subscriber who tried to call him while he was not reachable due to radio signalling<br>
absence, or because the mobile phone was in detach mode. The invention is<br>
concerned both with the method for implementing this service and with the<br>
functions of special devices employed when providing the same.<br>
Bachground art<br>
Recent estimates suggest that for every telephone network dealer, who at present is<br>
concerned with the public radio mobile service in Italy, there are daily tens of a<br>
million telephone calls which are unsuccessful because the "target" mobile phone is<br>
not reachable or is in the detach mode.<br>
In other words, notwithstanding the increased use of telephone answering systems<br>
(answering services), and call diversion services, it nevertheless happens, that in<br>
some special conditions, more than 400 calls/second are missed, thereby limiting the<br>
extent of outgoing traffic or, in any case, providing a restricted or partially complete<br>
service to subscribers.<br>
The basic difficulty found by a network administrator when tackling this kind of<br>
problem is that of getting through a considerable traffic.<br>
In fact, the problem of the recording and management - at the same time - of such a<br>
noticeable amount of data due to the high number of unsuccessful calls, the<br><br>
difficulties caused by a consistent evaluation of the geographical load of this service,<br>
the management of possible network failures, etc., have led to the situation that — up<br>
to now a solution to this problem has neither been considered nor put into practice.<br>
This problem does not lend itself to a simple solution, since many reasons may be the<br>
5 cause for the impossibility of establishing a communication<br>
- the radio mobile phone may be in the detach mode, the network having acquired<br>
the signal which confirms this fact (detach);<br>
- the battery is discharged or is disconnected from its operative position, or the SIM<br>
card is off;<br>
10 - a condition may exist wherein the transceiver station is not reachable or not visible,<br>
as the radio channel is notoriously very aleatory; etc.<br>
At last, it would be necessary — in any case - to verify the possible enabling of the<br>
call diversion service to the answering system or to a further telephone number.<br>
On the other hand, these conditions according to which it is impossible to reach a<br>
15 called subscriber, have till now been accepted by the users of the radio mobile<br>
service as intrinsically foreseeable but totally inevitable. In other words, this problem<br>
relating to the impossibility of establishing a connection has never been posed,<br>
because in comparison with the fixed network it was vvident that the cellular<br>
telephone; network would necessarily lead to this drawback, due to the intrinsic<br>
20 nature of the principle of operation of a mobile phone, which could momentarily be<br>
non reachable or in the detach mode.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide handling procedures for managing<br>
telephone calls directed to a radio mobile phone, which allow to improve the service,<br>
by eliminating the drawbacks due to communication barriers caused by the problem<br>
25 of a "non-reachable mobile phone".<br>
A further object of the present invention is to increase the number of free basic<br>
services offered to the users by the network dealer.<br>
A last object of the present invention is to provide a method far handling calls to a<br>
non-reachable radio mobile phone, and for handling the related, acquired<br>
information, the method employing standard protocols, technologies and components<br>
in the field of cellular radio mobile phones, in order to permit easy maintenance and<br>
reduce the cost of the method implementation.<br>
Disclosure of invention<br>
These and further objects which will be apparent from the description, ate obtained<br>
through a method for handling telephone calls directed to a non- reachable radio<br>
mobile phone and for handling information associated to the calling subscriber (like<br>
telephone number, time of the telephone call, and any additional information),<br>
wherein the method is started (triggered) by an event such as a vocal call, which in<br>
turn originates a notification through a recordable Short messaging Service (SMS)<br>
text channel, and comprises the two distinct basic steps of :<br>
I) routing the telephone call to a device for storage and management of data<br>
(information) relating to the phone call, when the called subscriber is not reachable,<br>
due to the subscriber mobile phone being in the detach mode or due to the absence of<br>
a radio-firequency signal, and when, at the same timee the call diversion service<br>
towards the answering service or another phone number is not operative;<br>
II) transmitting, that is notifying, to the called subscriber, at the moment the mobile<br>
phone is reachable again, all SMS texts including data relating to the calls missed in<br>
the period when the subscriber was not reachable;<br>
the method being based on a protocol, in which the usual steps sequence for<br>
performing a mobile telephone network call, is first started and thereafter<br>
immediately interrupted after the signaling and acquisition of the subscriber<br>
identification, and this steps sequence is resumed at the time it has been ascertained<br>
that the cellular radio mobile phone is reachable again, but actuating this time an<br>
SMS text channel, so as to completely eliminate the actual serial operative step<br>
sequence (transaction typical of a voice communication protocol, thereby producing,<br>
in fact, a traffic having a virtual nature.<br>
The method disclosed herein is basically different from the known telephone call<br>
diversion to the answering service, which involves in any case a complete serial<br>
operative calling and answering step sequence (transaction) and therefore a cost<br>
for the user, which depends from the time period during which the channel is<br>
engaged. The service has been realized using Terminal Access Control System<br>
(TACS), Global System For Mobile Communications (GSM), or General Packet<br>
Radio Service (GPRS), and it could also be realized by employing Universal Mobile<br>
Telecommunications System (UMTS) technology.<br>
As far as the user is concerned, this service works according to the following steps:<br>
- Ifauser is called while he is not reachable (cellular mobile phone in detached<br>
mode, or absence of radio-frequency signal), the calling user receives a vocal<br>
message informing him about the fact that the called user cannot be reached (this<br>
service is automatic, without any sort of control option being performed by the<br>
calling user).<br>
- Immediately after the called user is reachable again, he receives an SMS<br>
notification, including an indication of all telephone calls missed during the period<br>
while he was not reachable. The notification is sent by means of an SMS text to the<br>
owners of a GSM radio mobile phone, and to the owners of TACS radio mobile<br>
phones adapted to receive and transmit SMS text messages, whereas the notification<br>
is sent in the form of vocal SMS in case of TACS users whose cellular radio mobile<br>
phone is apt adapted to handle SMS text. The phone number of the calling<br>
subscriber,, the time of the telephone call, and any other relevant information relating<br>
to the calling subscriber and/or the called subscriber are transmitted at the same time.<br>
In case a user (with the same phone number) has called several times, only an<br>
indication pertaining to the most recent phone call will be provided. Moreover, if the<br>
number of missed telephone calls exceeds the available space in a single SMS,<br>
further SMS will be sent The information concerning missed telephone calls may be<br>
stored only for a maximum predetermined time period.<br>
The service is not actuated in the following circumstances:<br>
- The call diversion service is already active, towards an answering system or<br>
towards a different phone number,<br>
- The phone number of the calling user is not available or is not presented (e.g. a<br>
phone call form abroad, or in case of a bidden number, etc)<br>
- The called user is roaming abroad.<br>

Referring now to Fig. 1, this figure schematically shows the architecture used for<br>
providing tikis service, with dotted lines indicating the functions of standard protocol<br>
stacks; on the other hand, Figs. 2 and 3 denote the respective operative method used<br>
to carry out this service, which includes the following steps:<br>
I) the calling subscriber 1\ 1" dials (step 30) the destination or 'target" number and<br>
performs his telephone call by interconnecting himself to a PSTN telephone network<br>
4, in case the phone call is effected from a fixed line 1', or to the telephone network<br>
PLMN 5, in case the phone call is effected from a mobile phone 1",<br>
II) the original switching center MSC 2 interrogates the subscribers register 3<br>
(hereafter HLR), at 31, by means of the STP 10, by asking the roaming destination<br>
number,<br>
III) the HLR 3 checks at 32 (based on the VLR number), if the mobile phone is<br>
roaming abroad (this step is valid only for the GSM network).<br>
- if the answer is "YES", the phone call is handled according to the usual procedure<br>
33 provided for in GSM networks,<br>
- if the answer is "NO" the procedure continues through the steps described below,<br>
IV) the HLR 3 checks if the destination mobile phone is in the DETACH mode (34):<br>
IV i) if the answer is "NO", it transmits (35) to the original switching center MSC 2.<br>
the roaming number of the center MSC/VLR in which the destination number is<br>
registered (destination center) and the method continues as described below in steps<br>
V and subsequent ones, which relate to checking if the mobile phone is reachable;<br>
IV ii) if the answer is "YES", it is checked - at 36 - if the destination number has<br>
enabled the call diversion service towards its own answering service or towards<br>
another phone number:<br>
- if the answer is "YES", the number towards which the call diversion is active is<br>
returned (at 37) to the original exchange 2 (MSC), and the method proceeds by going<br>
back to step II;<br>
- if the answer is "NO", the number of the device 9 for the storage and management<br>
of phone calls (hereafter also called "paging management") is returned (at 38) to the<br>
original exchange (MSC) 2, and then the method proceeds as described in step VI.<br>
V In case the preliminary check on the DETACH mode of the mobile phone has led<br>
to a negative result, the destination center performs a further test 40 in order to<br>
establish if the destination ("target") mobile phone is reachable:<br>
- if the answer is "YES", the usual procedure for a phone call is started at<br>
33, following the common procedure provided for in radio mobile<br>
phone systems.<br>
- if, on the other hand, the mobile phone is not reachable, a connection is<br>
established at 38, towards the number of the device 9 for the paging<br>
management, and the method proceeds according to the following step.<br>
VT) If the mobile phone is turned off or is not reachable, and no call<br>
diversion is enabled, the calling user receives an announcement and the<br>
phone call is routed towards the device 9 for the paging management.<br>
In order to increase the degree of reliability the design is realized in such a way as to<br>
use two nodes of paging management Both nodes share the same Data Base 14 of<br>
the phone palls, which is duplicated in the respective sites. In order to manage correct<br>
synchronization and management of the two Data Base systems, and in order to avoid<br>
access conflicts on the same records (as would occur when two users call at the same<br>
time the same person whose mobile phone is turned off or not reachable by a radio-<br>
frequency signal), it was decided to define two series of different numbering on<br>
the HLR 3 for call-forwarding to the paging management device (these series are<br>
called "Call Forward Number MSISDN Paging_l" and "Call Forward Number<br>
MSISDN Paging_2"). The total number of numberings will be 10 (in order to leave a<br>
margin for, possible future introductions of other paging management platforms), and<br>
they are formed by adding at the end of the numbering "47000", the last number of<br>
the MSISDN of the called user with respect to whom the service is made active.<br>
To this purpose, the paging management device 9, - that is the device for the storage<br>
and management of information relating to phone calls towards a non-reachable<br>
mobile phone -, satisfies a plurality of specific functional requirements which relate<br>
to the ability of cooperating, through the mangment of the protocol ISUP, with the<br>
switching no des of the GSM network, and to the ability of extracting the calling<br>
number from the ISUP IAM message for the phone calls directed to a non-reachable<br>
mobile phone or in case of absence of a radio-frequency signal; furthermore there is<br>
provided the possibility of storing in a dedicated Data Base 14, all information<br>
related to phone calls directed to each mobile phone not reachable due to absence of<br>
radio frequency signal.<br>
Moreover, the paging management device 9 is suited to cooperate with the HLR,<br>
through the management of the MAP protocol, for a switching request with regard to<br>
the return of momentarily non reachable mobile phones, inside the area reachable by<br>
radio-frequency signals. At last, it is also capable of interfacing itself, - through the<br>
management of the UCP protocol -, with the SMS service center 11 of the GSM<br>
switching center, in order to send text messages towards the mobile phones which<br>
have returned inside the area where radio-frequency signals are active.<br>
On the other hand, under the aspect of the procedural realization of specific functions<br>
according to. the present invention, the paging management device 9 successively<br>
performs the following operations:<br>
I — It receives, at 50, only the signaling component of the phone call, it extracts the<br>
number of the calling subscriber from the IAM message of the ISUP signaling, it<br>
records the hour/date of the telephone call (with an accuracy of one second), and then<br>
it emits an appropriate deliver message (at 51) with respect to the MSC/VRL which<br>
is sending the data. This allows the MSC/VLR to possibly send a courtesy message<br>
(at 52), to the calling user, to deliver the phone call so as to release the phonic<br>
channel;<br>
II- it activates a check at 53, in order to determine whether the calling number is<br>
already in the list of numbers mat already tried to reach this particular subscriber,<br>
depending on the result of this check, it performs the following operations:<br>
- provided this number is already in the list of calling numbers for that subscriber, it<br>
replaces (at 54) the hour/date of the last phone call performed by this user number,<br>
with the hour/date recorded during the preceding step;<br>
- if, on the oher hand, this number is not iu the list of calling numbers for that<br>
subscriber, it adds this number to the list (at 55), together with an indication of the<br>
hour/date of the last telephone call;<br>
III - if from a test 56, it follows that the phone call corresponds to a first phone call,<br>
directed to the called subscriber during the period when he was not reachable, a<br>
request is made (at 57) to the HLR 3 (through MAP SET MESSAGE WAITING<br>
DATA) to receive a notification immediately after the "target user", that is the<br>
subscriber, is again reachable.<br>
When the addressee of the telephone call is again reachable, the HLR 3<br>
communicates this fact to the paging management device 9. According to a preferred.<br>
embodiment of the present invention, once the notification has been received, the<br>
paging management device subdivides the number list associated to the target mobile<br>
phone, into groups of four elements each, and for each of said groups it defines a text<br>
message to be sent to the user, containing information related to the phone calls<br>
comprised in this group.<br>
The paging management device sends to the short message service center, 11, the<br>
above defined messages, through the UCP protocol, indicating as addressee the<br>
number of the destination (that is, target) mobile phone.<br>
Finally the SMS-C sends the messages to the destination mobile phone at the time it<br>
is reachable again.<br>
The system that realizes the network architecture according to the above description<br>
is suited to provide a very high capacity of traffic management: it is able to manage<br>
350 phone calls per second, and up to 10 millions phone calls per day.<br>
These performances are obtained through a logical subdivision of the network load<br>
on a plurality of nodes and through the use of technologies, which are partly already<br>
known and already used in the field of telephony, but which are combined by means<br><br>
of the necessary implementations, extensions and modifications, so as to be able to<br>
finally provide the users with a new service.<br>
This service is already (default) enabled, although the user may request its<br>
deactivation by calling and dialing a new special option of a voice menu;<br>
subsequently, he can also request reactivation of this service, by performing similar<br>
actions.<br><br>
