				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
The present invention relates to a nnethod for operating a wind turbine with an electrical generator, drivable by a rotor, for supplying electrical power to an electrical load, in particular an electric grid.<br>
The invention further relates to a wind turbine with a rotor and an electrical generator coupled to the rotor for supplying electrical power to an electrical load, in particular an electric grid.<br>
In known wind turbines for generating electrical energy from wind energy, the generator with the electrical load, often an electric grid, is operated in a grid-parallel mode. In other words, as soon as the wind supply is sufficient, the wind turbine will generate electrical energy and deliver it to the grid.<br>
However, if a failure occurs in the grid, for example as a result of a short circuit in the grid, wind turbines have hitherto been disconnected from the grid and not reconnected to the grid until normal operating conditions have been restored.<br>
This means that, following such a grid failure, is no longer possible to provide the rapid support for the grid that is particularly needed when there are large fluctuations in the voltage and/or power that is required.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide a control system for one or more wind turbines that compensate as far as possible for fluctuations in the grid.<br><br>
This object is achieved with a method of the kind initially specified, in which the power delivered to the load by the generator is regulated in response to a current that is outputted to the load.<br>
In a device of the kind initially specified, the object is achieved by a control device comprising a current sensor for measuring an electrical current delivered to the load, such that the power delivered by the generator to the load can be controlled in response to the current that is received by the current sensor.<br>
In this way, the required power can be generated and delivered when there are fluctuations in the power requirements from the grid.<br>
In order to avoid overload of parts of the wind turbine and/or the grid in the event of a grid failure, for example as a result of a short circuit in the grid, the wind turbine is controlled in such a way that the current delivered to the grid does not exceed a predefined value.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the maximum current level that can be delivered is regulated for each grid phase, in order to support the grid as far as possible, on the one hand, without exposing components to the risk of damage, on the other hand.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment is one in which the wind turbine can be operated by an external input that corresponds to the stipulations made by a distant control station. In this way, a power supply company for example can request the wind turbine to deliver the amount of current which is needed at that moment to support the grid.<br>
Other advantageous embodiments of the invention are described in the subclaims.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for operating a wind turbine with an electrical generator, drivable by a rotor, for supplying electrical power to an electrical load, in particular an electric grid, characterized in that the power delivered by the generator to the load is regulated in response to a current that is outputted to the load.<br>
One embodiment of the invention shall now be described in detail with reference to the figures. These show.<br>
Figure 1      a wind turbine that feeds power to a grid, in a simplified view;<br><br>
Figure 2        a control device according to the invention for operating a wind<br>
turbine; and Figure 3        a  block  diagram  of the  main  components  in  the  control  and<br>
regulation arrangement.<br>
A wind turbine 2, shown in simplified form in Figure 1, comprising a rotor 4 is connected to an electric grid 6 that may be a public grid, for example. Several electrical loads 8 are connected to the grid. The electrical generator of wind turbine 2, not shown in Figure 1, is coupled to an electrical control and regulation arrangement 10 that firstly rectifies the alternating current generated in the generator and subsequently converts the current into an alternating current with a frequency corresponding to the grid frequency. Instead of a grid 6, a single load could also be supplied with electrical energy by the wind turbine 2. The control and regulation arrangement 10 has a regulating device according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the regulating device according to the invention. The rotor 4, shown in simplified form, is coupled to a generator 12 that provides an amount of electrical power that depends on the wind speed and hence on the wind power. The alternating current produced in the generator 12 is initially rectified and subsequently converted into an alternating current that has a frequency corresponding to the grid frequency.<br>
With the help of a current sensor {not shown), the amount of current being fed into the grid 6 (Figure 1) is detected. Said current is compared at the same time with a predefined value I(max).<br>
If the current fed into the grid 6 now exceeds the predefined maximum current l(max), the power generated by the entire wind turbine (and/or its generator) is adjusted by the regulating device in such a way that the current delivered to the grid does not exceed the predefined threshold value l(max). In the event of a short circuit, said current regulation can be accomplished, for example, by the wind turbine delivering a significantly lower level of power output to the grid than previously, while using elsewhere outside the grid the power that consequently is not fed to the grid, for example for a dumpload (resistance),   or  by  feeding  the  power  which   is   not  fed   to   the  grid   to<br><br>
capacitors or other interim storage devices. As soon as full availability of the grid is restored, delivery of the stored energy to the grid can be resumed.<br>
In this way, even when there is a short circuit in the grid, the wind turbine can continue to deliver power to the grid and support the grid without the current exceeding the predefined threshold value as a result of the short circuit.<br>
Figure 3 shows constituent parts of the control and regulation arrangement 10 in Figure 1. The control and regulation arrangement 10 includes a rectifier 16, in which the alternating current produced by the generator is rectified. An inverter 18 connected to the rectifier 16 converts the direct current back into an alternating current with a frequency corresponding to the grid frequency. This current is fed into the grid 6 in three phases LI, L2 and L3. The inverter 18 is controlled with the help of a microcontro|l^jr_20 that forms part of the regulating device. The microprocessor 20 is coupled for this purpose to the inverter 18. The input variables for regulating the current with whiqh the electrical power provided by the wind turbine 2 is fed into the grid 6 are the momentary current and/or the momentary currents, the grid frequency, the electrical power output P of the generator, the power factor cos ip and the power gradient dP/dt. Regulation, pursuant to the invention, of the current to be delivered to the grid is implemented in microprocessor 20. The current in each of phases LI, L2 and L3 is separately detected and the respective levels are taken into account in the regulation arrangement pursuant to the invention.<br>
If the measured current (level) l(actual) of a phase rises above a predetermined maximum current, the inverter 18 is controlled in such a way that the current (level) falls below the predefined maximum current l(max), with the electrical energy generated from wind energy and not delivered to the grid being used elsewhere, for example by being outputted to a resistance (dumpload) or stored in an interim storage device (e.g. a capacitor or Ultracap).<br>
The control system for the wind turbine can operate independently. The wind turbine then detects a short circuit in the grid, for example by monitoring the voltages of the separate grid phases and/or their phase position. If predefinable   threshold   values   for   voltages   and/or   phase   differences   are<br><br>
reached, the wind turbine recognizes a short circuit and operates according to an algorithm provided for such a case.<br>
Owing to the external access (22), it is possible, for example for the power supply company to whose grid the wind turbine is connected, to intervene in the operation of the wind turbine and, for example, to modify the amount of current to be delivered to the grid, the type of current (active current, reactive current) and/or the phase angle and/or phase position, etc.. In this way, the power supply company can adjust precisely those values (current, voltage, electrical power) in respect of the power to be delivered to the grid by the wind turbine that correspond to the requirements of the network operator.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
