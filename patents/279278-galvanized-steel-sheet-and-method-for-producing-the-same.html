				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
GALVANIZED STEEL SHEET AND METHOD FOR PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a method for stably<br>
producing a galvanized steel sheet having low sliding<br>
resistance and excellent press formability during press<br>
molding and also relates to a galvanized steel sheet.<br>
Background Art<br>
Galvanized steel sheets are widely used for various<br>
applications such as automotive bodies. For such<br>
applications, the galvanized steel sheets are press-molded<br>
for use. The galvanized steel sheets, however, have a<br>
disadvantage that the galvanized steel sheets are inferior<br>
in press formability to cold-rolled steel sheets. This is<br>
because the sliding resistance of the galvanized steel<br>
sheets to press molds is greater than that of the cold-<br>
rolled steel sheets. That is, the galvanized steel sheets<br>
have portions with high sliding resistance to press molds<br>
and beads and therefore are unlikely to be provided in the<br>
press molds; hence, the galvanized steel sheets are likely<br>
to be broken.<br>
Galvannealed steel sheets produced through hot-dip<br>
galvanizing and then alloying are more excellent in<br>
wwldability and coatability as compared with other<br>
galvanized steel sheets and are widely used for automotive<br>
bodies.<br>
A galvannealed steel sheet is one obtained as follows:<br>
a steel sheet is .galvanized and is then heat-treated such<br>
that an alloying reaction occurs due to the interdiffusion<br>
of Fe in the steel sheet and Zn in a plating layer to create<br>
an Fe-Zn alloy phase. The Fe-Zn alloy phase is usually a<br>
coating consisting of a T phase, a 81 phase, and a C, phase.<br>
Hardness and melting point tend to decrease with a reduction<br>
in Fe concentration, that is, in the order of the T phase,<br>
the 81 phase, and the L, phase. Therefore, high-Fe<br>
concentration coatings are useful in view of slidability<br>
because the coatings have high hardness and a high melting<br>
point and are unlikely to be adhesive. Since press<br>
formability is one of important properties of the<br>
galvannealed steel sheet, the galvannealed steel sheet is<br>
produced so as to include a coating with a slightly<br>
increased Fe concentration.<br>
However, the high-Fe concentration coatings have a<br>
problem that F phases which are hard and brittle are likely<br>
to be formed at plating-steel sheet interfaces to cause a<br>
phenomenon in which peeling occurs at the interfaces, that<br>
is, so called powdering, during machining.<br>
Patent Documents 1 and 2 disclose techniques for<br>
solving the problem. In the techniques, a galvanized steel<br>
sheet is improved in weldability and workability in such a<br>
manner that an oxide film made of ZnO is formed on the<br>
galvanized steel sheet by electrolysis, dipping, coating<br>
oxidation, or heating.<br>
However, the application of the techniques disclosed in<br>
the Patent Documents 1 and 2 to the galvannealed steel sheet<br>
is not effective in achieving an improvement in press<br>
formability because the galvannealed steel sheet has low<br>
surface reactivity and large surface irregularities because<br>
of the presence of Al oxides. Since the galvannealed steel<br>
sheet has low surface reactivity, it is difficult to form a<br>
desired coating on the galvannealed steel sheet by<br>
electrolysis, dipping, coating oxidation, or heating and a<br>
portion with low reactivity, that is, a portion containing a<br>
large amount of the Al oxides, is reduced in thickness.<br>
Since the surface irregularities are large, surface<br>
protrusions are brought into direct contact with a press<br>
mold during press molding and contacts between the press<br>
mold and thin portions of the surface protrusions have high<br>
sliding resistance; hence, a sufficient improvement in press<br>
formability cannot be achieved.<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses a technique in which a<br>
steel sheet is galvanized by hot dipping, alloyed by heating,<br>
temper-tolled, contacted with an acidic solution with pH<br>
buffering action, held for one to 30 seconds, and then<br>
washed with water, whereby an oxide layer is formed on a<br>
plating surface layer.<br>
Patent Document 4 discloses a method for forming an<br>
oxide layer on a flat surface portion of an unalloyed hot-<br>
dip galvanized steel sheet. In the method, the hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet is temper-rolled, contacted with an<br>
acidic solution with pH buffering action, held for a<br>
predetermined time in such a state that a film of the acidic<br>
solution is disposed on the steel sheet, washed with water,<br>
and then dried.<br>
A method disclosed in Patent Document 5 is effective in<br>
uniformly forming an oxide layer on an electrogalvanized<br>
steel sheet. In this method, the electrogalvanized steel<br>
sheet is contacted with an acidic solution with pH buffering<br>
action or an acidic electrogalvanizing bath, held for a<br>
predetermined time, washed with water, and then dried.<br>

Application Publication No. 2005-248262<br>
In the case of using the techniques disclosed in Patent<br>
Documents 3 to 5, good press formability can be achieved<br>
under conventional production conditions. However, it has<br>
become clear that good press formability cannot be achieved<br>
in some cases because the holding time of steel sheets<br>
contacted with acidic solutions cannot be sufficiently<br>
secured under recent high-speed conditions and therefore<br>
formed oxide layers are thin.<br>
In order to solve such a problem, it is effective to<br>
increase the distance from the contact with an acidic<br>
solution to water washing. However, this needs to secure a<br>
space therebetween, leading to spatial restriction.<br>
In view of the foregoing circumstances, the present<br>
invention has an object to provide a method capable of<br>
stably producing a galvanized steel sheet having excellent<br>
press formability in a reduced space under high-speed<br>
conditions and an object to provide a galvanized steel sheet<br>
having excellent press formability.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The inventors have made intensive investigations to<br>
solve the above problems. As a result, the inventors have<br>
obtained findings below.<br>
It has turned out from that in the techniques disclosed<br>
in Patent Documents 3 to 5, zinc ions dissolved from zinc<br>
plating are used to produce zinc oxide on surfaces and<br>
therefore the time taken to dissolve the zinc ions therefrom<br>
elongates the time taken to form the oxide films. Thus, the<br>
inventors have considered that if a solution used to form an<br>
oxide film contains zinc ions, the time taken to dissolve<br>
the zinc ions is not needed and therefore the time taken to<br>
form the oxide film can be reduced. However, no oxide film<br>
has been sufficiently formed from a solution containing zinc<br>
ions. This is probably because although environments<br>
suitable for producing zinc oxides are created in the<br>
techniques disclosed in Patent Documents 3 to 5 since<br>
hydrogen ions are reduced simultaneously with the<br>
dissolution of zinc and therefore the pH in the vicinity of<br>
a surface increases, the use of the zinc ion-containing<br>
solution is not enough to increase the pH in the vicinity of<br>
a surface and therefore any environment suitable for<br>
producing zinc oxides is not created. Therefore, the<br>
inventors have conceived that a galvanized steel sheet is<br>
contacted with an aqueous solution containing zinc and is<br>
further contacted with a weak alkali solution, whereby the<br>
pH in the vicinity of a surface therefore is increased.<br>
The present invention is based on the above finding.<br>
The scope of the present invention is as described below.<br>
(1) A method for producing a galvanized steel sheet<br>
obtained by forming an oxide layer on a steel sheet includes<br>
contacting the steel sheet with a zinc-containing aqueous<br>
solution having a zinc ion concentration of 1 to 100 g/1,<br>
contacting the steel sheet with an aqueous solution with a<br>
pH of 6 to 14, washing the steel sheet with water, and then<br>
drying the steel sheet.<br>
(2) In the galvanized steel sheet-producing method<br>
specified in Item (1), the zinc ion concentration is within<br>
a range from 5 to 100 g/1 and the aqueous solution has a pH<br>
of 7 to 13.<br>
(3) In the galvanized steel sheet-producing method<br>
specified in Item (1) or (2), the zinc-containing aqueous<br>
solution has a pH of 1 to 6.<br>
(4) A galvanized steel sheet produced by the galvanized<br>
steel sheet-producing method specified in any one of Items<br>
(1) to (3) includes an oxide layer which principally<br>
contains zinc as a metal component, which is disposed on a<br>
steel sheet, and which has an average thickness of 10 nm or<br>
more.<br>
The term "galvanized steel sheet" as used herein refers<br>
to a plated steel sheet having a coating which is made of<br>
zinc and which is disposed thereon and includes a hot-dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet (hereinafter simply referred to as a<br>
GI steel sheet); a galvannealed steel sheet (hereinafter<br>
simply referred to as a GA steel sheet); an<br>
electrogalvanized steel sheet (hereinafter simply referred<br>
to as an EG steel sheet); a zinc-deposited steel sheet; a<br>
zinc alloy-plated steel sheet containing an alloy element<br>
such as Fe, Al, Ni, Mg, or Co; and the like.<br>

Best Modes for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, a galvanized steel<br>
sheet having excellent press formability and low sliding<br>
resistance during press molding can be produced in a reduced<br>
space under high-speed conditions.<br>
In the course of producing a GA steel sheet, a steel<br>
sheet is galvanized by hot dipping and is then alloyed by<br>
heating. The GA steel sheet has surface irregularities due<br>
to the difference in reactivity between steel sheet-plating<br>
interfaces during alloying. The alloyed steel sheet is<br>
usually temper-rolled for the purpose of material<br>
achievement. A plating surface is smoothed by the contact<br>
with rollers during temper-rolling and the irregularities<br>
are reduced. Thus, the force necessary for a mold to crush<br>
plating surface protrusions is reduced during press molding<br>
and therefore sliding properties can be improved.<br>
Since a flat surface portion of the GA steel sheet is<br>
brought into direct contact with the mold during press<br>
molding, the presence of a hard refractory substance capable<br>
of preventing the adhesion to the mold is important in<br>
improving slidability. In this viewpoint, the presence of<br>
an oxide layer on a surface layer is effective in improving<br>
slidability because the oxide layer prevents the adhesion to<br>
the mold.<br>
Since surface oxides are worn or are scraped during<br>
actual press molding, the presence of a sufficiently thick<br>
oxide layer is necessary when the contact area between a<br>
mold and a workpiece is large. Although a plating surface<br>
has an oxide layer formed by heating during alloying, most<br>
of the oxide layer is broken during temper rolling because<br>
of the contact with rollers and therefore a fresh surface is<br>
exposed. Hence, in order to achieve good slidability, a<br>
thick oxide layer needs to be formed prior to temper rolling.<br>
Even if such a thick oxide layer is formed prior to temper<br>
rolling in consideration of this, the breakage of the oxide<br>
layer cannot be avoided during temper rolling and therefore<br>
oxide layers are nonuniformly present on flat portions.<br>
Hence, good slidability cannot be stably achieved.<br>
Good slidability can be stably achieved by forming a<br>
uniform oxide layer on the temper-rolled GA steel sheet,<br>
particularly on a plating surface flat portion.<br>
The following technique is effective in uniformly<br>
forming a oxide layer on a zinc plating: a technique in<br>
which a galvanized steel sheet is contacted with an acidic<br>
solution with pH buffering action, held for a predetermined<br>
time in such a state that a film of the acidic solution is<br>
disposed on the steel sheet, washed with water, and then<br>
dried. However, the formed oxide layer is thin because the<br>
time for which the steel sheet is held subsequently to the<br>
contact with the acidic solution is not sufficiently secured<br>
under recent high-speed conditions as described above; hence,<br>
good press formability cannot be achieved in some cases. It<br>
is effective in solving this problem to increase the<br>
distance from the contact with the acidic solution to water<br>
washing. However, this needs to secure a space therebetween,<br>
leading to spatial restriction.<br>
In the present invention, it has been invented that a<br>
galvanized steel sheet is contacted with an aqueous solution<br>
containing zinc ions and is further contacted with a weak<br>
alkali aqueous solution such that an increase in pH is<br>
caused. In the present invention, it is an important<br>
requirement and feature that the galvanized steel sheet is<br>
contacted with the zinc ion-containing aqueous solution and<br>
is further contacted with the weak alkali aqueous solution.<br>
This allows an oxide layer sufficient to secure good press<br>
formability to be formed in a reduced space without<br>
suffering from spatial restriction.<br>
A mechanism for forming the oxide layer is not clear<br>
but is probably as described below. Since the galvanized<br>
steel sheet is contacted with the zinc ion-containing<br>
aqueous solution and is then contacted with the weak alkali<br>
aqueous solution in such a state that the steel sheet is<br>
covered with the zinc ion-containing aqueous solution, the<br>
pH of the zinc ion-containing aqueous solution on the steel<br>
sheet is increased to a pH level where oxides (hydroxides)<br>
are stable. This probably results in the formation of the<br>
oxide layer, which is stable, on the galvanized steel sheet.<br>
In the present invention, the oxide layer is formed on<br>
the galvanized steel sheet in such a manner that the steel<br>
sheet is contacted with the zinc-containing aqueous solution,<br>
contacted with the weak alkali aqueous solution, that is, an<br>
aqueous solution with a pH of 6 to 14, washed with water,<br>
and then dried.<br>
In the present invention, the weak alkali aqueous<br>
solution has a pH of 6 to 14. Zinc is an amphoteric metal<br>
and therefore is soluble in extremely low and high pH<br>
solutions. Thus, in order to form the oxide layer, the<br>
aqueous solution on the galvanized steel sheet needs to be<br>
rendered alkaline. The pH thereof is preferably 7 to 13 and<br>
more preferably 9 to 11.<br>
The concentration of zinc in the aqueous solution is<br>
within a range from 1 to 100 g/1 in the form of zinc ions.<br>
When the concentration of the zinc ions is less than 1 g/1,<br>
a sufficient amount of zinc is not supplied and therefore<br>
the oxide layer is unlikely to be formed. When the<br>
concentration thereof is greater than 100 g/1, the<br>
concentration of sulfuric acid in the oxide layer is high<br>
and therefore it is concerned that the oxide layer is<br>
dissolved in a subsequent chemical conversion step to<br>
contaminate a conversion solution. The concentration is<br>
preferably within a range from 5 to 100 g/1.<br>
In order to form the oxide layer from a stable zinc<br>
compound, the zinc ions are preferably used in the form of a<br>
sulfate. In the case of using the sulfate, there is<br>
probably an advantage that sulfate ions are captured in the<br>
oxide layer to stabilize the oxide layer.<br>
The pH of the zinc-containing aqueous solution is not<br>
particularly limited and is preferably 1 to 6. When the pH<br>
thereof is greater than 6, the zinc ions form precipitates<br>
in the aqueous solution (the formation of a hydroxide) and<br>
are not provided on the steel sheet in the form of an oxide.<br>
When the pH thereof is less than 1, the dissolution of zinc<br>
is promoted; hence, the mass per unit area of plating is<br>
reduced and a plating film has cracks and therefore is<br>
likely to be stripped off during machining. When the pH<br>
thereof is high within the range of 1 to 6, the pH thereof<br>
quickly increases to a level where oxides are stable upon<br>
the contact with the weak alkali aqueous solution. This is<br>
advantageous in forming the oxides. Therefore, the pH<br>
thereof is preferably within the range of 4 to 6.<br>
The solution disclosed in Patent Document 3 is<br>
characterized by being acidic and by having a pH buffering<br>
action. However, the zinc ion-containing aqueous solution<br>
is used herein and therefore the oxide layer can be<br>
sufficiently formed even if Zn is not sufficiently dissolved<br>
by reducing the pH of the aqueous solution. It is<br>
advantageous in forming the oxides that the pH thereof<br>
quickly increases upon the contact with the weak alkali<br>
aqueous solution. Therefore, any pH buffering action is not<br>
necessarily essential.<br>
In the present invention, the oxide layer, which has<br>
excellent slidability, can be stably formed when an aqueous<br>
solution contacted with the steel sheet contains zinc.<br>
Therefore, even if impurities such as other metal ions and<br>
inorganic compounds are accidentally or deliberately<br>
contained in the aqueous solution, advantages of the present<br>
invention are not reduced. N, P, B, Cl, Na, Mn, Ca, Mg, Ba,<br>
Sr, and Si can be used as far as advantages of the present<br>
invention are not reduced even if these elements are<br>
captured in the oxide layer.<br>
The oxide layer is formed on the galvanized steel sheet<br>
as described above. The oxide layer contains zinc, which is<br>
an essential component, and has a thickness of 10 nm or more.<br>
The term "oxide layer" as used herein refers to a layer<br>
made of an oxide and/or hydroxide principally containing<br>
zinc, which is a metal component. The oxide layer, which<br>
principally contains such a component as zinc, needs to have<br>
an average thickness of 10 nm or more. When the thickness<br>
of the oxide layer less than 10 nm, an effect of reducing<br>
slidability is insufficient. When the thickness of the<br>
oxide layer, which contains such an essential component as<br>
Zn, is greater than 100 nm, a coating is broken during<br>
pressing to cause an increase in slidability and weldability<br>
is likely to be reduced. This is not preferred.<br>
A process for contacting the galvanized steel sheet<br>
with the zinc-containing aqueous solution is not<br>
particularly limited. Examples of such a process include a<br>
process for dipping a plated steel sheet in an aqueous<br>
solution, a process for spraying an aqueous solution onto a<br>
plated steel sheet, a process for applying an aqueous<br>
solution to a plated steel sheet with a coating roller, and<br>
the like. The aqueous solution is preferably finally<br>
present on the steel sheet in the form of a thin liquid film.<br>
This is because when the amount of the aqueous solution<br>
present on the steel sheet is large, the pH of a plating<br>
surface is unlikely to be uniformly and quickly increased by<br>
alkali treatment in the next step. In this viewpoint, it is<br>
preferable and effective that the amount of an acidic<br>
solution film formed on a steel sheet is adjusted to 50 g/m2<br>
or less. The amount of the solution film can be adjusted by<br>
roll drawing, air wiping, or the like.<br>
Examples of the galvanized steel sheet according to the<br>
present invention include those produced by various methods<br>
such as a hot-dip plating method, an electroplating method,<br>
a vapor deposition plating method, and a spraying method.<br>
Examples of a plating composition include pure Zn, Zn-Fe,<br>
Zn-Al, Zn-Ni, and Zn-Mg. However, in an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the type of plating is not limited<br>
because the dissolution of Zn occurs in the galvanized steel<br>
sheet, which principally contains Zn, and the oxide layer<br>
can be formed.<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention is further described below in<br>
detail with reference to examples.<br>
Plating films having a mass per unit area of 45 g/m2 and<br>
an Al concentration of 0.20 mass percent were formed on<br>
cold-rolled steel sheets with a thickness of 0.8 mm by hot<br>
dip galvanizing and the cold-rolled steel sheets were then<br>
temper-rolled,. whereby GI steel sheets were prepared.<br>
Plating films having a mass per unit area of 45 g/m2, an Fe<br>
concentration of ten mass percent, and an Al concentration<br>
of 0.20 mass percent were formed on cold-rolled steel sheets<br>
with.a thickness of 0.8 mm by an ordinary galvannealing<br>
method and the cold-rolled steel sheets were then temper-<br>
rolled, whereby GA steel sheets were prepared. EG steel<br>
sheets including plating films having a mass per unit area<br>
of 30 g/m2 were prepared, the plating films being formed on<br>
cold-rolled steel sheets with a thickness of 0.8 mm by an<br>
ordinary electrogalvanizing method.<br>
The GI steel sheets, GA steel sheets, and EG steel<br>
sheets obtained as described above were dipped in zinc<br>
sulfate solutions with various concentrations shown in Table<br>
1. After being taken out of the zinc sulfate solutions, the<br>
steel sheets were dipped in aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solutions adjusted in pH or the aqueous sodium hydroxide<br>
solutions were sprayed onto the steel sheets. The time<br>
taken to dip the steel sheets in the aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solutions or taken to spray the aqueous sodium<br>
hydroxide solutions onto the steel sheets was one second.<br>
The steel sheets were washed with water within one second<br>
after dipping or spraying was finished. Before being<br>
treated with the aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions, the<br>
steel sheets were tested in such a manner that the zinc<br>
sulfate solutions remaining thereon were wiped with rubber<br>
rollers.<br>
For comparison, some of the steel sheets were subjected<br>
to a test in which dipping in a zinc-free solution and<br>
treatment with sodium hydroxide were performed, a test in<br>
which treatment with the aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions<br>
was not performed, a test in which dipping was not performed<br>
after temper rolling, or a test in which the pH of a zinc<br>
ion-containing aqueous solution was adjusted with sulfuric<br>
acid.<br>
The following test was performed as a conventional<br>
technique: a test in which the steel sheets were dipped in<br>
a 50°C aqueous solution which contained 30 g/1 sodium<br>
acetate and which had a pH of 1.5 was performed, the amount<br>
of the aqueous solution remaining thereon was adjusted to 10<br>
g/m2 after dipping was finished, and the steel sheets were<br>
held for one to 30 seconds.<br>
For the steel sheets prepared as described above, oxide<br>
layers of tempered portions and untempered portions of<br>
plating surface layers were measured for thickness and also<br>
measured for coefficient of friction for the purpose of<br>
simply evaluating press formability. Measurement methods<br>
were as described below.<br>
(1) Press formability evaluation test (coefficient-of-<br>
friction measurement test)<br>
For the evaluation of press formability, each test<br>
piece was measured for coefficient of friction as described<br>
below.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic front view of a coefficient-of-<br>
friction tester. As shown in this figure, a coefficient-of-<br>
friction measurement specimen 1 taken from the test piece is<br>
fixed on a stage 2 and the stage 2 is fixed on the upper<br>
surface of a sliding table 3 which is horizontally movable.<br>
The lower surface of the sliding table 3 overlies a sliding<br>
table support 5 which includes rollers 4 in contact with the<br>
lower surface thereof and which is vertically movable. The<br>
sliding table support 5 is attached to a first load cell 7<br>
for measuring the pressing load N applied to the<br>
coefficient-of-friction measurement specimen 1 from a bead 6<br>
by raising the sliding table support 5. The sliding table 3<br>
has an end portion attached to a second load cell 8 for<br>
measuring the sliding resistance force F required to<br>
horizontally move the sliding table 3 along a rail 9 in such<br>
a state that the pressing load is applied thereto. The<br>
specimen 1 was coated with lubricating oil, that is, washing<br>
oil, PRETON R352L, available from Sugimura Chemical<br>
Industrial Co., Ltd. and was then tested.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic perspective view showing the<br>
shape and size of the bead used. The bead 6 slides on the<br>
specimen 1 in such a state that the lower surface of the<br>
bead 6 is pressed against the specimen 1. The bead 6 has a<br>
width of 10 mm and a length of 12 mm in the sliding<br>
direction of the specimen and includes lower end portions,<br>
spaced in the sliding direction thereof, having curved<br>
surfaces with a curvature of 4.5 mm R as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The bead lower surface, against which the specimen is<br>
pressed, has a flat area having a width of 10 mm and a<br>
length of 3 mm in the sliding direction thereof. A<br>
coefficient-of-friction measurement test was performed under<br>
two conditions below.<br>
(Condition 1)<br>
The bead shown in Fig. 2 was used, the pressing load N<br>
was 400 kgf, and the drawing rate of the specimen (the<br>
horizontal movement speed of the sliding table 3) was 100<br>
cm/min.<br>
(Condition 2)<br>
The bead shown in Fig. 2 was used, the pressing load N<br>
was 400 kgf, and the drawing rate of the specimen (the<br>
horizontal movement speed of the sliding table 3) was 20<br>
cm/min.<br>
The coefficient of friction between the test piece and<br>
the bead was calculated from the equation \i = F / N.<br>
(2) Measurement of thickness of oxide layer (oxide layer<br>
thickness)<br>
An Si wafer having an Si02 film, formed by thermal<br>
oxidation, having a thickness of 96 nm was used as a<br>
reference and an OKoc x-ray was measured with an X-ray<br>
fluorescence spectrometer, whereby the average thickness of<br>
the oxide layer was determined in terms of Si02. The<br>
analysis area was 30 mm (p.<br>
Test results obtained as described above are shown in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Issues below were clarified from the test results shown<br>
in Table 1.<br>
Nos. 10 to 13, 15 to 26, 28, 29, and 31 to 54 are<br>
examples of the present invention that use aqueous solutions<br>
having a zinc ion concentration within the scope of the<br>
present invention. Oxide layers with a thickness of 10 nm<br>
or more are formed and low coefficients of friction are<br>
exhibited. A reduction in coefficient of friction is caused<br>
independently of whether a process for contacting a weak<br>
alkali aqueous solution is dipping or spraying.<br>
Nos. 28, 29, 31, and 32 are examples of the present<br>
invention that use sulfuric acid to reduce the pH of aqueous<br>
solutions containing zinc ions. Sufficient oxide layers are<br>
formed even at low pH and a reduction in coefficient of<br>
friction is verified.<br>
Nos. 21, 22, 41, 42, 51, and 52 are examples in which<br>
aqueous solutions containing Zn ions are wiped with rubber<br>
rollers prior to the contact with weak alkali aqueous<br>
solutions. Oxide layers are formed by the contact with the<br>
Zn ion-containing aqueous solutions independently of whether<br>
roller wiping is performed or not, resulting in a reduction<br>
in coefficient of friction.<br>
No. 1 has a high coefficient of friction because No. 1<br>
is treated with no solution and therefore an oxide layer<br>
sufficient to enhance slidability is not formed in a flat<br>
portion.<br>
Nos. 2 to 6 are results due to conventional techniques<br>
(comparative examples) in which holding was performed for<br>
one to 30 seconds after dipping in a treatment solution is<br>
finished. Oxide layers grow with the holding time, so that<br>
oxide layers with a thickness of 20 nm or more are obtained<br>
at a holding time of five seconds or more and oxide layers<br>
with a thickness of 30 nm or more are obtained at a holding<br>
time of 30 seconds or more.<br>
Nos. 7 to 9 are comparative examples using a Zn-free<br>
solution (a sodium acetate solution). Oxide layers have a<br>
thickness of less than 10 nm, which is outside the scope of<br>
the present invention, and have a high coefficient of<br>
friction.<br>
Nos. 14, 27, and 30 are comparative examples performing<br>
no treatment with a weak alkali aqueous solution.<br>
Sufficient oxide layers are not formed only by the contact<br>
with aqueous solutions containing zinc ions and therefore no<br>
advantage is obtained.<br>
As is clear from the results of the examples, in Nos. 2<br>
to 6 which are conventional techniques, oxide layers with a<br>
thickness of 20 nm or more are not obtained unless holding<br>
is performed five seconds or more and oxide layers with a<br>
thickness of 30 nm or more are not obtained unless holding<br>
is performed 30 seconds or more. In contrast, in the<br>
examples of the present invention, the alkali solution-<br>
dipping or -spraying time, which corresponds to the holding<br>
time taken in each conventional technique, can be<br>
significantly reduced to one second. In consideration of<br>
production equipment, the present invention is applied to a<br>
facility for continuously producing a steel strip at high<br>
speed and the rate of producing the steel strip is about 180<br>
m per minute in terms of the movement speed of the steel<br>
strip. Therefore, in a conventional technique, the length<br>
of a holding facility used subsequently to dipping in a<br>
treatment solution needs to be 15 to 90 m; however, in the<br>
present invention, only an alkali solution-dipping or -<br>
spraying facility with a size of about 3 m at minimum is<br>
necessary. This allows a compact facility to be used.<br>
In the techniques disclosed in Patent Documents 3 to 5,<br>
in order to secure a sufficient holding time after the<br>
contact with an acidic solution under high-speed production<br>
conditions, the distance from the contact with an acidic<br>
solution to water washing needs to be secured. The test<br>
results suggest that good slidability can be achieved by<br>
placing a sprayer only subsequently to the contact with an<br>
acidic solution containing zinc ions and also suggest that<br>
the present invention enables stable production in a reduced<br>
space under high-speed conditions.<br>
