				<td>Method for the manufacture of a hinge-lid bos<br>
Field of technology<br>
The present invention is related to hinge-lid boxes or containers for cigarettes, cigars,<br>
cigarillos, pastilles, sweets and other goods. The invention relates to a method for the<br>
manufacture of said hinge-lid boxes, particularly to a method for attaching of the<br>
collar to the packet portion.<br>
State of the art<br>
Hinge-lid boxes are a form of packaging, which is commonly used for packaging of<br>
cigarettes, cigars and sweets. Hinge-lid boxes, also known as flip-top packages, are<br>
usually made of cardboard and they comprise a packet portion and a lid articulated on<br>
a box rear wall and a collar. The collar is anchored in the box part and has a collar<br>
front wall, collar sidewalls and optional collar back wall. The collar may be attached<br>
with lower fastening surfaces in the region of the collar front wall, collar side flaps<br>
and optional collar back wall to the inner side of the package. Hinge-lid boxes are<br>
generally manufactured from blanks comprising thin cardboard. In order to reduce the<br>
material and production costs, a hinge-lid box is often used, comprising a single all-<br>
in-one blank, wherein a collar or an inner frame, also called retainer or liner, may be<br>
connected to a main blank for the hinge-lid box. The hinge-lid box may also comprise<br>
a separate box-part blank and a collar part blank, which are glued together.<br>
An example of a single all-in-one blank is described in US 5,634,556. The collar is<br>
connected to a main blank in the region of folding tabs of the lid by adhesive bonding<br>
using glue spots.<br><br>
A two-part blank for a flip-top container comprising an outer case forming portion<br>
and a liner portion is disclosed in GB 2.267,272. The collar is adhesively attached to<br>
the case-forming portion through a location panel hingedly connected to the collar<br>
using two vertical glue-lines on the front panel.<br>
US 5,462,223 discloses a process for coating glue-spot rows and strips onto longitu-<br>
dinaly extending blanks for hinge-lid boxes. The glue-spots are applied by using glue<br>
nozzles of fixed location. The glue nozzles are designed for very high numbers of<br>
cycles so that, even at high working speed of the packaging machine and correspond-<br>
ingly high conveying speeds for the blanks, exact glue patterns can be transferred.<br>
Two parallel spot rows are applied to the inside of the front wall in order to fix the<br>
collar front wall.<br>
A process for gluing packaging material, such as blanks or folding tabs of packs,<br>
during the production of hinge-lid boxes for cigarettes, is disclosed in US 6,409,646.<br>
Measures for reliable malfunction-free transfer of complex applications of glue to<br>
packaging materials with a packaging machine having a high output capacity are<br>
proposed. Accordingly, a hinge-lid box is configured, as far as the formation and an<br>
arrangement of applications of glue in the region of side walls and lid side walls are<br>
concerned, such that the outside tabs and lid side tabs are connected to another by<br>
narrow continuous strips of glue running in the longitudinal direction of said tabs and<br>
preferably by two parallel strips of glue in each case. The gluing of the lid part is<br>
carried out using glue spots.<br>
According to prior art, glue spots, which are arranged in the region of the front wall of<br>
the package for fixing a collar formed from a separate blank as part of the hinged lid<br>
box, have been also disclosed. It has been proposed for spot-like applications of glue<br>
to be applied to the non-folded, that is to say planar blanks, from above by glue<br><br>
nozzles producing spots of glue at selected positions by way of short spraying or<br>
injecting cycles. The application of glue in the region of the collar is designed such<br>
that the application of glue is constituted of glue spots or one glue line.<br>
In the hinge-lid boxes according to the state of the art, the rigidity of package is not<br>
sufficient although the cardboard used in the manufacture is relatively thick. Glue<br>
spots or vertically arranged glue lines do not provide the box sufficient stiffness. The<br>
lid of the box may open, the box yields and sags easily especially when the box is not<br>
filled with the products or half empty and the products like cigarettes may be dam-<br>
aged and become useless. This problem has been solved by using thicker board. Thus<br>
there is an evident need for a method for the manufacture of light hinge-lid box with<br>
sufficient rigidity.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
An object of the invention is to propose measures by means of which a collar or an<br>
inner frame, also called retainer or liner, can be affixed to the blank or frame board of<br>
a hinge-lid box.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a more rigid and light hinge-lid box<br>
with improved deformation resistance capacity, which results in that the board basis<br>
weight can be reduced without losing package rigidity, and thus savings can be<br>
achieved in the board.<br>
A further object of the invention is a method for the manufacture of hinge-lid boxes,<br>
particularly a method for gluing of the collar to the box portion of a hinge-lid<br>
container.<br><br>
Characteristic features of the method according to the invention are presented in the<br>
claims.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
It has now been found that the above-identified objects can be achieved and the<br>
problems related to the solutions according to the state of the art can be avoided or at<br>
least substantially decreased by using the method according to the invention. The<br>
method for the manufacture of hinge-lid boxes comprises steps wherein glue is<br>
applied by horizontal line gluing on the blank of the collar on an area which remains<br>
covered in the finished box, and/or horizontally on the respective area of the blank of<br>
the box part, which the collar will be attached to and the number of horizontal glue<br>
lines is at least two and preferably three.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the invention, by changing the size and geometry of the glued area, the<br>
rigidity of the hinge-lid boxes can be increased significantly, which results in that the<br>
board basis weight can be reduced without losing package rigidity. It was also found<br>
that the glue connection plays an important role in package rigidity. Package rigidity<br>
or deformation resistance capacity can be greatly increased by changing size and<br>
geometry of the glued area.<br>
The method according to the invention, for the manufacture of hinge-lid boxes and<br>
particularly for gluing of the collar to the box portion of the hinge-lid container,<br>
comprises steps wherein glue is applied as uniform horizontal glue lines on the blank<br>
of the collar and/or horizontally on the respective area of the blank of the box part,<br>
which the collar will be attached to and the number of horizontal glue lines is at least<br>
two and preferably three. Preferably the glue lines are applied so that at least one glue<br>
line horizontally crosses the whole blank of the collar and at least one glue line<br>
crosses horizontally the lower part of the collar blank. The glue line may also be<br>
applied horizontally on the upper parts of the collar blank. According to one embodi-<br>
ment the glue lines may form a surface covering the whole area of the collar blank,<br>
which remains covered in the finished box. The geometry of the glued area is line or<br>
strip shape. Preferably the width of the glue line is at least 4 mm. Since the bending<br>
deformation is the most common deformation pattern, it is preferable to use strip-<br><br>
shaped glue area geometry and the orientation of the strips should follow the bow-<br>
shaped bending and nor perpendicular.<br>
The gluing may be carried out using any gluing technique according to the state of the<br>
art, which suits for gluing of packages and boxes.<br>
In the method according to the invention a hinge-lid box may be used comprising a<br>
single one piece blank or it may comprise two blanks, the other being the blank for<br>
the collar, or it may comprise more than two blanks. The form of the collar can be any<br>
conventional form or it may be V-shaped. The shape and design of the front part of<br>
the collar may vary, larger front part enables a larger glued area thus from its part<br>
improving the rigidity of the box. The blank of the collar part may also comprise a<br>
part, which partly or completely crosses the back wall of the box. The collar may<br>
optionally be printed and/or coated.<br>
The blahk(s) of the hinge-lid boxes are manufactured from board or paper and the<br>
collar may be manufactured from the same material as the box part or from thicker<br>
material when the collar and the box part are manufactured from separate blanks.<br>
According to the invention, thinner and lighter board can be used without losing the<br>
rigidity of the package. Depending on the design and structure, and deformation<br>
pattern under loading, the basis weight of the board or paper used for boxes, when<br>
compared with the currently used board with a thickness of 0.3 mm for cigarette<br>
boxes, can be reduced 20 - 30 %, for example from 215 g/m to 200 g/m2.<br>
According to the invention, a collar of a hinge-lid box is provided, which supports the<br>
front wall of the box and the rigidity of the box is clearly improved. Thus a steady<br>
beam like structure is achieved. The hinge-lid boxes, manufactured according to the<br>
invention, are light and sufficiently rigid and they have high deformation resistance<br><br>
capacity whereby the boxes retain their form even when they are almost empty, and<br>
the lid keeps tightly closed. The method makes it possible to use lighter grades of<br>
board, whereby savings can be made in raw material consumption resulting in source<br>
reduction.<br>
The hinge-lid boxes manufactured with the method according to the invention may<br>
be used for packaging of cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, pastilles, sweats and other<br>
goods in the form of granules or pills.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the following example, however, to which the scope of<br>
the invention is not meant to be limited.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
An empty cigarette package, subjected to external forces, was simulated using finite<br>
element method. Structural analysis of the cigarette package was performed. The<br>
objective of the study was to examine the influence of the glue connection between<br>
the inframe and the package on package rigidity, and to find out whether by changing<br>
the size and geometry of the glued area it is possible to increase the rigidity of the<br>
package in order to reduce the board basis weight without loosing package rigidity.<br>
Experiments were also conducted on paperboard to measure the material properties<br>
and on cigarette packages to obtain the experimental data for comparison with the<br>
results from finite element analysis (FEA) [1-2], which provides a numerical tool for<br>
package structural analysis. A cigarette package was modelled in computer and its<br>
structure was studied. The deformation of the cigarette package subjected to external<br><br>
forces was calculated. The analysis provided a basis for judgement of the package<br>
"rigidity" and guidance for possible reduction of board basis weight.<br>
It was found that the glue connection plays an important roll in package rigidity. The<br>
tests showed that the package rigidity or deformation resistance capacity could be<br>
greatly increased by changing the size and geometry of the glued area, and that there<br>
is a potential to lower the basis weight of paperboard without loosing package<br>
rigidity. Based on the results from the present analysis, the basis weight of a package<br>
can be reduced from 215 g/m2 to 200 g/m2.<br>
Finite element analysis model (FE model)<br>
A commercial finite element analysis program MARC [3] was used. The structure of<br>
a cigarette package as shown in Fig. 1 was modelled wherein 1 presents a glue point,<br>
2 fliptop, 3 inframe, 4 frontpanel, 5 sidepanels and 6 backpanel. The flip-top could be<br>
either opened or closed. The inframe was attached to the box (below the term "box"<br>
will be used for the package without inframe) by glue points. The dimensions of the<br>
package (not on scale) are shown in Fig. 2. The Fiber orientation, i.e. the machine<br>
direction (MD) of the paperboard, is also shown in Fig. 2. The panels were jointed<br>
together with creased zones. Gaps 7 exist at certain edges as indicated in Fig. 2.<br>
Eight-node thin shell elements were used. Figure 3 shows the mesh of the package<br>
used in the finite element analysis (FEA). The material properties of the paperboard<br>
(orthotropic material) are listed in Table 1. The creases were incorporated in the<br>
model using rotational spring elements. The rotational stiffness of the creases was<br>
determined by folding tests. The glue points were modelled using the rigid link<br>
elements.<br><br><br>
a.	Symmetric pressing on the two sidepanels, shown in Fig. 4, wherein 8 represents<br>
pressure loadings and 9 displacement output mode.<br>
This loading case was a simplified simulation of holding a cigarette package in a hand<br>
and squeezing it. The package was pressed on both sidepanels. The pressure load was<br>
applied on the shaded area in Fig. 4. The package was constrained according to<br>
symmetric conditions. Opened and closed flip-top packages were considered.<br>
b.	Side loading (shear loading) is presented in Fig. 5, wherein 10 represents fixed<br>
point and 11 point load.<br>
In this case the focus was on the influence of crease stiffness on package rigidity. In<br>
order to expose the effect of crease stiffness, the flip-top was not considered (Fig. 5),<br>
The package was fixed (zero displacement and rotation) at three points on the<br><br>
backpanel. A point load was applied on one sidepanel.<br>
Because of the thin flexible nature of the panels, and associated large deflections of<br>
the panels, geometrically nonlinear analysis was performed. For the package with<br>
closed flip-top under symmetric loading, the contact and relative movement (sliding)<br>
between the inframe and the flip-top was modelled using contact elements. The<br>
material was considered as linear.<br>
The front- and backpanel of the packages are usually not perfectly flat and almost<br>
always have certain curvatures, although they are usually very small. These small<br>
initial curvatures are very important in the structure analysis for the symmetric<br>
pressing case. They were incorporated by applying first small initial perturbation<br>
forces on the front- and backpanel of the packages.<br>
Package rigidity and size and geometry of glued area<br>
The inframe is conventionally glued to the box at three points as can be seen from<br>
Fig. 1. The glued area can be considered as a circle of about 10 mm in diameter. In<br>
the analysis, the round-glued area was approximated by the quadrilateral elements.<br>
Two modified glue cases were considered. According to the invention the glue point<br>
between inframe and frontpanel was changed to 3 glue lines. The size and geometry<br>
as well as length and width of the glue lines are shown in an embodiment in Fig. 6a.<br>
In Fig. 6b is shown another embodiment according to the invention wherein the first<br>
glue line crosses horizontally the whole collar part and the third glue line crosses<br>
horizontally the lower section of the collar. The inframe is glued fully to the box.<br>
Results of analysis for symmetric pressing:<br><br>
Figures 7 (deformed package, closed fliptop) and 8 (deformed package, opened<br>
fliptop) show the typical deformed shapes of the packages under the same symmetric<br>
loading with closed and opened flip-top, respectively. For the package with closed<br>
flip-top, the flip-top would slide open as the applied load increases. The calculation<br>
stopped when inframe is pop-out. Further calculation to capture this sudden shape<br>
change needs small load increments and long calculation time (which was not<br>
considered in the present study). For the package with opened flip-top, the calculation<br>
stopped when the deformation becomes too large, i.e. the maximum displacement on<br>
the frontpanel is over about 8 mm. In order to characterize the deformation of the<br>
package, the displacement of a point on the frontpanel as shown in Fig. 4 (near the<br>
maximum displacement point of the frontpanel) is used.<br>
Figures 9 (influence of glued area, closed fliptop) and 10 (influence of glued area,<br>
opened fliptop) show the results of the finite element analysis for different ways of<br>
gluing the inframe. The total applied force (y-axis) on one side panel was calculated<br>
by the product of the pressure and the pressure applied area. The displacement of the<br>
point on the frontpanel (Fig. 4) used to characterize the package deformation was<br>
calculated in the analysis and is shown in x-axis. Two board materials, Avanta Ultra<br>
C200 and CX200, were used. "3p" is for the 3-point glued inframe, and "31 for the 3-<br>
line glued inframe, "fy" for the fully glued inframe. The dash lines in the figures are<br>
auxiliary lines showing the slope of the force and displacement curve representing the<br>
package rigidity.<br>
As expected, the package rigidity is increased by the 3-line and fully glued inframe.<br>
The increase of the package rigidity is more for opened flip-top (Fig. 10) than for<br>
closed fliptop (Fig. 9). This is a reasonable result, because the strengthen effect of the<br>
frontpanel by the inframe is exposed in the case of the opened fliptop. The package<br>
deformation resistance capacity has increased very much by changing the way of<br><br>
inframe gluing. Take Fig. 9 for example, for the package with 3-point glued inframe<br>
the rigidity decreases very much when the displacement is larger than 0.75 mm (curve<br>
slope change showed by the dash lines). However, the packages with 3-line and fully<br>
glued inframes are much stiffer when the displacement is over 0.75 mm. There is very<br>
little difference between the 3-line and fully glued inframe. This indicates that there<br>
is an optimal way to glue the inframe to obtain the maximum rigidity increase of the<br>
package. The influence of the difference between the board material Avanta Ultra C<br>
and CX was very small.<br>
Figures 11 (influence of basis weight, closed fliptop) and 12 (influence of basis<br>
weight, opened fliptop) show the results for different board basis weights. The<br>
inframe in these packages was glued to the box at 3 points. The dash lines in the<br>
figures are auxiliary lines showing the initial rigidity of the packages. As expected,<br>
the package rigidity increases with increasing board basis weight. Increased basis,<br>
weight effects the rigidity mostly at small deformation (All curves for different basis<br>
weight have a similar shape). In closed flip-top containers, increasing basis weight<br>
showed a little stronger effect on the package rigidity than changing of the way of<br>
inframe gluing at small deformation (Fig. 9 and 11). For packages with opened flip-<br>
top, the rigidity at small deformation was almost the same for the packages with 3-<br>
line and fully glued inframes (Fig. 10) as for the packages with the increased basis<br>
weight of 230 g/m2 (Fig. 12). At large deformation the packages with 3-line and fully<br>
glued inframes are much stronger, while the increasing of basis weight has very little<br>
effect.<br>
Figure 13 (force resistance capacity, closed fliptop) and 14 (force resistance capacity,<br>
opened fliptop) show the resistance force at a certain displacement of the point on the<br>
frontpanel (Fig. 4). In the figures, "200+3p", "215+3p" and "230+3p" represent the<br>
packages with basis weight of 200, 215 and 230 g/m2, respectively, and 3-point glued<br><br>
inframes. "200+31" is the package with basis weight of 200 g/m2 and 3-line glued<br>
inframe. For packages with closed flip-top (Fig. 13), it seems that the rigidity of the<br>
packages is not influenced veiy much by the way of inframe gluing. It is more<br>
dependent on the basis weight of the packages because of the locking effect of the<br>
fliptop. Figure 13 shows that at small displacement (0.5 and 0.75 mm) the package<br>
with basis weight of 200 g/m2 and 3-line glued inframe (200+31) is not as rigid as<br>
the packages with basis weight of 215 and 230 g/m2 and 3-point glued inframe<br>
(215+3p and 230+3p). When the displacement increases to 1 mm, the rigidity of the<br>
package with basis weight of 200 g/m2 and 3-line glued inframe (200+31) can match<br>
the rigidity of the packages of 215 g/m2 and 3-point glued inframe (215+3p).<br>
For packages with opened fliptop (Fig. 14), the rigidity of the packages is increased<br>
very much by changing the way of inframe gluing. Unlike the packages with closed<br>
fliptops, the rigidity increase can be seen at both samll and large displacement. This<br>
indicates that the strengthen effect of gluing plays a key role when the fliptop is<br>
opened.<br>
The above analysis indicates that it is possible to reduce the basis weight from 215 to<br>
200 g/m2 while keeping the package rigidity by changing the way of inframe gluing.<br><br>
