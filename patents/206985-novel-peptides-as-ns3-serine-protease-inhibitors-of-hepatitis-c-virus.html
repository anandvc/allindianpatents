Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel hepatitis C virus ("HCV") protease inhibitors, pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more such inhibitors, methods of preparing such.inhibitors and methods of using such inhibitors to treat hepatitis C and related disorders. This invention specifically discloses novel peptide compounds as inhibitors of the HCV NS3/NS4a serine protease.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a (+)-sense single-stranded RNA virus that has been implicated as the major causative agent in non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH), particularly in blood-associated NANBH (BB-NANBH)(see, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 89/04669 and European Patent Application Publication No. EP 381 216). NANBH is to be distinguished from other types of viral-induced liver disease, such as hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), delta hepatitis virus (HDV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as well as from other forms of liver disease such as alcoholism and primary biliar cirrhosis.<br>
Recently, an HCV protease necessary for polypeptide processing and viral replication has been identified, cloned and expressed; (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,712,145). This approximately 3000 amino acid polyprotein contains, from the amino terminus to the carboxy terminus, a nucleocapsid protein (C), envelope proteins (E1 and E2) and several non-structural proteins (NS1, 2, 3,4a, 5a and 5b). NS3 is an approximately 68 kda protein, encoded by approximately 1893 nucleotides of the HCV genome, and has two distinct domains: (a) a serine protease domain consisting of approximately 200 of the N-terminal amino acids; and (b) an RNA-dependent ATPase domain at the C-terminus of the protein. The<br><br>
NS3 protease is considered a member of the chymotrypsin family because of similarities in protein sequence, overall three-dimensional structure and mechanism of catalysis. Other chymotrypsin-like enzymes are elastase, factor Xa, thrombin, trypsin, plasmin, urokinase, tPA and PSA. The HCV NS3 serine protease is responsible for proteolysis of the polypeptide (polyprotein) at the NS3/NS4a, NS4a/NS4b, NS4b/NS5a and NS5a/NS5b junctions and is thus responsible for generating four viral proteins during viral replication. This has made the HCV NS3 serine protease an attractive target for antiviral chemotherapy.<br>
It has been determined that the NS4a protein, an approximately 6 kda polypeptide, is a co-factor for the serine protease activity of NS3. Autocleavage of the NS3/NS4a junction by the NS3/NS4a serine protease occurs intramolecularly (he., cis) while the other cleavage sites are processed iritermolecularly (i.e., trans).<br>
Analysis of the natural cleavage sites for HCV protease revealed the presence of cysteine at P1 and serine at P1' and that these residues are strictly conserved in the NS4a/NS4b, NS4b/NS5a and NS5a/NS5b junctions. The NS3/NS4a junction contains a threonine at P1 and a serine at P1\ The Cys-»Thr substitution at NS3/NS4a is postulated to account for the requirement of cis rather than trans processing at this junction. See, e.g., Pizzi et al. (1994) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci (USA) .£1:888-892, Failla etal. (1996) Folding &amp; Design 1:35-42. The NS3/NS4a cleavage site is also more tolerant of mutagenesis than the other sites. See, ag^ Kollykhalov etal. (1994) J. Virol. 68:7525-7533. It has also been found that acidic residues in the region upstream of the cleavage site are required for efficient cleavage. See, e.g., Komoda etal. (1994) J. Virol. 68:7351-7357.<br>
Inhibitors of HCV protease that have been reported include antioxidants (see, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 98/14181), certain peptides and peptide analogs (see, International Patent Application Publication No. WO 98/17679, Landro etal. (1997) Biochem. 36:9340-9348, Ingallinella etal. (1998) Biochem. 37:8906-8914, Llinas-Brunet et al. (1998) Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 8:1713-1718). inhibitors based on the 70-amino acid polypeptide eglin c<br><br>

Virol, 71:7461-7469). cVHE2 (a "cameiized" variable domain antibody fragment) (Martin et al.(1997) Protein Ena, 10:607-614). and cc1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) (Elzouki etal.) (1997) J. Hepat. 27:42-28). A ribozyme designed to selectively destroy hepatitis C virus RNA has recently been disclosed (see, BioWorld Today 9(217): 4 (November 10,1998)).<br>

HCV has been implicated in cirrhosis of the liver and in induction of hepatocellular carcinoma. The prognosis for patients suffering from HCV infection is currently poor. HCV infection is more difficult to treat than other forms of hepatitis due to the lack of immunity or remission associated with HCV infection. Current data indicates a less than 50% survival rate at four years post cirrhosis diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with localized resectable hepatocellular carcinoma have a five-year survival rate of 10-30%, whereas those with localized unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma have a five-year survival rate of less than 1%.<br>

IIH Solid Phase Synthesis:<br>
Solid-phase synthesis is useful for the production of small amounts of certain compounds of the present invention. As with the conventional solid-phase synthesis of peptides, reactors for the solid-phase synthesis of peptidyl ketoamides are comprised of a reactor vessel with at least one surface permeable to solvent and dissolved reagents, but not permeable to synthesis resin of the selected mesh size. Such reactors include glass solid phase reaction vessels with<br>
a sintered glass frit, polypropylene tubes or columns with frits, or reactor Kans^M made by Irori Inc., San Diego CA. The type of reactor chosen depends on volume of solid-phase resin needed, and different reactor types might be used at different stages of a synthesis. The following procedures will be referenced in the subsequent examples:<br>
Procedure A: Coupling reaction: To the resin suspended in N-methylpyrrolidine (NMP) (10-15 mL/ gram resin) was added Fmoc-amino acid (2 eq), HOAt (2 eq), HATU (2 eq) and diisopropylethylamine (4 eq). The mixture was let to react for 4-48 hours. The reactants were drained and the resin was washed successively with dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, methanol, dichloromethane and diethylether (use 10-15 mL solvent/ gram resin). The resin was then dried in vacuo.<br>
Procedure B: Fmoc deprotection: The Fmoc-protected resin was treated with 20% piperidine in dimethylformamide (10 mL reagent/ g resin) for 30 minutes. The reagents were drained and the resin was washed successively with<br><br>
dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, methanol, dichloromethane and diethyl ether (10 mL solvent/ gram resin).<br>
Procedure C: Boc deprotection: The Boc-protected resin was treated with a 1:1 mixture of dichloromethane and trifluoroacetic acid for 20-60 minutes (10 mL solvent/ gram resin). The reagents were drained and the resin was washed successively with dichloromethane, dimethylformamide, 5% diisopropylethylamine in dimethylformamide, dimethylformamide, dichloromethane and dimethylformamide (10 mL solvent/ gram resin).<br>
Procedure D: Semicarbazone hydrolysis: The resin was suspended in the cleavage cocktail (10 mL/ g resin) consisting of trifluoroacetic acid: pyruvic acid: dichloromethane: water 9:2:2:1 for 2 hours. The reactants were c rained and the procedure was repeated three more times. The resin was washed successively with dichloromethane, water and dichloromethane and dried under vacuum. Procedure E: HF cleavage: The dried peptide-nVal(CO)-G-0-PAM resin (50 mg) was placed in an HF vessel containing a small stir bar. Anisole (10% of total volume) was added as a scavenger. In the presence of glutamic acid and cysteine amino acids, thioanisole (10%) and 1,2-ethanedithiol (0.2%) were also added. The HF vessel was then hooked up to the HF apparatus (Immuno Dynamics) and the system was flushed with nitrogen for five minutes. It was then cooled down to -70°C with a dry ice/ isopropanol bath. After 20 minutes, HF was distilled to the desired volume (10 mL HF/ g resin). The reaction was let to proceed for one and a half hour at 0°C. Work up consisted of removing all the HF using nitrogen. Dichloromethane was then added to the resin and the mixture was stirred for five minutes. This was followed by the addition of 20% acetic acid in water (4 mL). After stirring for 20 minutes, the resin was filtered using a fritted funnel and the dichloromethane was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining residue and the mixture was washed with hexanes (2x) to remove scavengers. Meanwhile, the resin was soaked in 1 mL methanol. The aqueous<br><br>
layer (20% HOAc) was added back to the resin and the mixture was agitated for five minutes and then filtered. The methanol was removed under reduced pressure and the aqueous layer was lyophilized. The peptide was then dissolved in 10-25% methanol (containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) and purified by reverse phase HPLC.<br>

Spectrophotometric Assay: Spectrophotometric assay for the HCV serine protease was performed on the inventive compounds by following the procedure described by R. Zhang et a/, Analytical Biochemistry, 270 (1999) 268-275, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. The assay based on the proteolysis of chromogenic ester substrates is suitable for the continuous monitoring of HCV NS3 protease activity. The substrates were derived from the P side of the NS5A-NS5B junction sequence (Ac-DTEDWX(Nva), where X = A or P) whose C-terminal carboxyl groups were esterified with one of four different chromophoric alcohols (3- or4-nitrophenol, 7-hydroxy-4-methyl-coumarin, or 4-phenylazophenol). Presented below are the synthesis, characterization and application of these novel spectrophotometric ester substrates to high throughput screening and detailed kinetic evaluation of HCV NS3 protease inhibitors.<br>
Materials and Methods:<br>
Materials: Chemical reagents for assay related buffers were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, Missouri). Reagents for peptide synthesis were from Aldrich Chemicals, Novabiochem (San Diego, California), Applied<br><br>
Biosystems (Foster City, California) and Perseptive Biosystems (Framingham, Massachusetts). Peptides were synthesized manually or on an automated ABi model 431A synthesizer (from Applied Biosystems). UVA/IS Spectrometer model LAMBDA 12 was from Perkin Elmer (Norwalk, Connecticut) and 96-well UV plates were obtained from Corning (Coming, New York). The prewarming block was from USA Scientific (Ocala, Florida) and the 96-well plate vortexer was from Labline Instruments (Melrose Park, Illinois). A Spectramax Plus microtiter plate reader with monochrometer was obtained from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale, California).<br>
Enzyme Preparation: Recombinant heterodimeric HCV NS3/NS4A protease (strain 1a) was prepared by using the procedures published previously (D. L. Sali et a/, Biochemistry, 37 (1998) 3392-3401). Protein concentrations were determined by the Biorad dye method using recombinant HCV protease standards previously quantified by amino acid analysis. Prior to assay initiation, the enzyme storage buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCI, 10% glycerol, 0.05% lauryl maltoside and 10 mM DTT) was exchanged for the assay buffer (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 300 mM NaCI, 10% glycerol, 0.05% lauryl maltoside, 5 |jM EDTA and 5 pM DTT) utilizing a Biorad Bio-Spin P-6 prepacked column. Substrate Synthesis and Purification: The synthesis of the substrates was done as reported by R. Zhang et a/, (ibid.) and was initiated by anchoring Fmoc-Nva-OH to 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin using a standard protocol (K. Barlos et al, Int. J. Pept Protein Res., 37 (1991), 513-520). The peptides were subsequently assembled, using Fmoc chemistry, either manually or on an automatic ABI model 431 peptide synthesizer. The N-acetylated and fully protected peptide fragments were cleaved from the resin either by 10% acetic acid (HOAc) and 10% trifluoroethanol (TFE) in dichloromethane (DCM) for 30 min, or by 2% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in DCM for 10 min. The combined filtrate and DCM wash was evaporated azeotropically (or repeatedly extracted by aqueous Na2C03 solution) to remove the acid used in cleavage. The DCM phase was dried over Na2S04 and evaporated.<br><br>
The ester substrates were assembled using standard acid-alcohol coupling procedures (K. Holmber et a/, Acta Chem. Scand., JB33 (1979) 410-412). Peptide fragments were dissolved in anhydrous pyridine (30-60 mg/ml) to which 10 molar equivalents of chromophore and a catalytic amount (0.1 eq.) of para-toluenesulfonic acid (pTSA) were added. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC, 3 eq.) was added to initiate the coupling reactions. Product formation was monitored by HPLC and found to be complete following 12-72 hour reaction at room temperature. Pyridine solvent was evaporated under vacuum and further removed by azeotropic evaporation with toluene. The peptide ester was deprotected with 95% TFA in DCM for two hours and extracted three times with anhydrous ethyl ether to remove excess chromophore. The deprotected substrate was purified by reversed phase HPLC on a C3 or C8 column with a 30% to 60% acetonitrile gradient (using six column volumes). The overall yield following HPLC purification was approximately 20-30%. The molecular mass was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy. The substrates were stored in dry powder form under desiccation.<br>
Spectra of Substrates and Products: Spectra of substrates and the corresponding chromophore products were obtained in the pH 6.5 assay buffer. Extinction coefficients were determined at the optimal off-peak wavelength in 1-cm cuvettes (340 nm for 3-Np and HMC, 370 nm for PAP and 400 nm for 4-Np) using multiple dilutions. The optimal off-peak wavelength was defined as that wavelength yielding the maximum fractional difference in absorbance between substrate and product (product OD - substrate OD)/substrate OD).<br>
Protease Assay: HCV protease assays were performed at 30°C using a 200 pi reaction mix in a 96-well microliter plate. Assay buffer conditions (25 mM MOPS pH 6.5, 300 mM NaCI, 10% glycerol, 0.05% lauryi maltoside, 5 pM EDTA and 5 pM DTT) were optimized for the NS3/NS4A heterodimer (D. L. Sali et a/, ibid.)). Typically, 150 pi mixtures of buffer, substrate and inhibitor were placed in wells<br><br>
h<br>
(final concentration of DMSO    4 % v/v) and allowed to preincubate at 30 °C for approximately 3 minutes. Fifty pis of prewarmed protease (12 nM, 30°C) in assay buffer, was then used to initiate the reaction (final volume 200 pl).The plates were monitored over the length of the assay (60 minutes) for change in absorbance at the appropriate wavelength (340 nm for 3-Np and HMC, 370 nm for PAP, and 400 nm for 4-Np) using a Spectromax Plus microtiter plate reader equipped with a monochrometer (acceptable results can be obtained with plate readers that utilize cutoff filters). Proteolytic cleavage of the ester linkage between the Nva and the chromophore was monitored at the appropriate wavelength against a no enzyme blank as a control for non-enzymatic hydrolysis. The evaluation of substrate kinetic parameters was performed over a 30-foid substrate concentration range (-6-200 pM). Initial velocities were determined using linear regression and kinetic constants were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using non-linear regression analysis (Mac Curve Fit 1.1, K. Raner). Turnover numbers<br>
(/feat) were calculated assuming the enzyme was fully active.<br>
•<br>
Evaluation of Inhibitors and Inactivators: The inhibition constants (Ki*) for the competitive inhibitors Ac-D-(D-Gia)-L-l-(Cha)-C-OH (27), Ac-DTEDWA(Nva)-OH and Ac-DTEDWP(Nva)-OH were determined experimentally at fixed concentrations of enzyme and substrate by plotting VQ/VJ VS. inhibitor concentration ([I] 0) according to the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition kinetics: Vo/Vj = 1 + [|] 0 /(Ki* (1 + [S] 0 /Km)), where v0 is the uninhibited initial velocity, Vj is the initial velocity in the presence of inhibitor at any given inhibitor concentration ([l]0) and [S]0 is the substrate concentration used. The resulting data were fitted using linear regression and the resulting slope, 1/(Ki*(1+[S]o/Km), was used to calculate the Ki* value.<br>
The obtained Ki* values for the various compounds of the present invention are given in the afore-mentioned Tables wherein the compounds have been arranged in the order of ranges of Ki* values. From these test results, it would be<br><br>
apparent to the skilled artisan that the compounds of the invention have excellent utility as NS3-serine protease inhibitors.<br>
