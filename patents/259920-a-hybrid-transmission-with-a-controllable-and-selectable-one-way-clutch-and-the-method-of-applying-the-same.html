SELECTABLE ONE-WAY CLUTCH<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to the control of a selectable<br>
one-way clutch,  and in particular to  a selectable one-way  clutch having three<br>
operational modes for use within a hybrid transmission having a motor controller and<br>
a transmission controller, wherein clutch speed synchronization is controlled by the<br>
motor controller and clutch actuation and release are controlled by the transmission<br>
controller.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	In a vehicle having a gasoline/electric hybrid transmission, the vehicle<br>
may be powered alternately by a gasoline-powered internal combustion engine or an<br>
electric motor to thereby optimize fuel efficiency while reducing vehicle emissions.<br>
Hybrid vehicles achieve their relatively high fuel efficiency in large part by<br>
alternating between the gasoline-powered engine and the electric motor when one<br>
power source is better suited than the other for a specific vehicle operating condition.<br>
For example, a gasoline-powered engine is known to be more efficient than an electric<br>
motor during periods of constant or relatively non-variable vehicle speed, such as<br>
while cruising at a sustained rate of speed, while an electric motor is generally better<br>
suited than a gasoline engine for use when the vehicle power requirements are highly<br>
variable, such as during starting or stopping of the vehicle.<br>
[0003]	Vehicles having either conventional internal combustion or hybrid<br>
gasoline/electric transmissions typically utilize a torque-transmitting device known as<br>
a friction clutch or clutch pack for smoothly engaging or coupling two rotating bodies<br>
or shafts to transmit torque therebetween. Likewise, the same clutch pack is used to<br>
subsequently disengage the coupled shafts to interrupt the power transfer and permit,<br>
for example, a smooth shifting between the various gears of a planetary gear set<br>
and/or decoupling of one or more motor/generators. Hybrid vehicles in particular<br>
generally shift gears in a more controlled and synchronous manner relative to<br>
conventional gas engines, due in part to the unique configuration and integrated<br>
hybrid motor and transmission controls. However, even within the more synchronous<br><br>
2<br>
shifting mechanism of a hybrid transmission, conventional clutch packs tend to<br>
require a higher hydraulic pump pressure to quickly and fully actuate the conventional<br>
clutch-apply mechanism, which may in turn lead to higher losses within the hydraulic<br>
circuit and/or spin losses at or along the clutch plate interface.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004|	Accordingly, a hybrid gasoline/electric transmission having a motor<br>
controller and a transmission controller is provided comprising a controllable three-<br>
mode, selectable one-way clutch with an outer race, an inner race, a pair of actuators,<br>
and two selector plates that are slidingly engageable within the outer race, the<br>
transmission controller being configured to select between the three operating modes<br>
and the motor controller being configured to synchronize the clutch speed to facilitate<br>
mode selection.<br>
[0005]	In one aspect of the invention, the three operational modes comprise<br>
freewheeling in two clutch rotational directions, torque holding in one rotational<br>
direction, and torque holding in two rotational directions.<br>
[0006]	In another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for controlling<br>
a selectable one-way clutch within a hybrid transmission having a motor controller<br>
and a transmission controller. The method includes detecting the speed difference<br>
across the selectable one-way clutch using a speed sensor, communicating the<br>
detected speed difference from the speed sensor to the transmission controller,<br>
synchronizing the clutch speed using the motor controller, and selecting between one<br>
of three clutch operational modes in response to a speed difference signal from the<br>
transmission controller.<br>
[0007]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0019]	Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers correspond<br>
to like or similar components throughout the several figures, there is shown in Figure<br>
1A a portion of a hybrid transmission 10 having a controllable, selectable one-way<br>
clutch 18, hereinafter referred to as clutch 18. Clutch 18 is preferably a mechanical<br>
diode-type selectable one-way clutch, but may also take the form of, for example, a<br>
sprag clutch, roller clutch, or other selectable one-way clutch. Clutch 18 has mating<br>
concentric inner and outer races 20, 22, respectively. As shown in Figure 1C, inner<br>
race 20 has an outer wall 39, a plurality of angled wells 36 as will be described later<br>
hereinbelow, and a plurality of radially-inward projecting teeth or splines 24 that are<br>
configured to engage or mate with slots or grooves of a rotatable body, such as a drive<br>
or crank shaft (not shown). Likewise, as shown in Figure 1A, outer race 22 has an<br>
outer wall 35 having a plurality of outwardly-projecting teeth or splines 26 that are<br>
configured to mate with slots or grooves of a preferably stationary or grounded clutch<br>
hub (not shown).<br>
[0020]	Hybrid transmission 10 has a speed sensor 11, a motor controller 16,<br>
and a transmission controller 14. Speed sensor 11 is preferably an input/output-type<br>
speed sensor of the type known in the art, and is configured to deliver a speed sensor<br>
signal to the transmission controller 14. The motor controller 16 is configured to<br>
control the operation of at least one and preferably two motor/generators 82, 84,<br>
labeled M/G 1 and M/G 2, respectively, as well as to synchronize the rotational<br>
speeds of the inner and outer races 20, 22, as described later herein. The transmission<br>
controller 14 is configured to control the operation and/or functionality of the non-<br>
motor components of the hybrid transmission 10, and is configured to receive a signal<br>
from the speed sensor 11 for actuation (i.e. apply and release) of the clutch 18. A first<br>
and second projection or arm 12A and 12B are each operatively and respectively<br>
connected to a first and second selector plate 50, 52 of the clutch 18, with each<br>
selector plate 50, 52 shown in more detail in Figure IB.<br>
[0021]	Figure IB, which is a plan view depicting clutch 18 with inner race 20<br>
removed to show the internal detail of clutch 18, shows the outer race 22 with a<br>
preferably continuous circumferential groove 56 that is sized and shaped to guide or<br>
direct selector plates 50, 52, each of which are at least partially slidably moveable or<br><br>
5<br>
repositionable within the groove 56. Selector plates 50, 52 each have a plurality of<br>
preferably identical and equally spaced openings or windows 51. Also, a plurality of<br>
substantially identical strut wells or pockets 32A, 32B are arranged around the outer<br>
wall 35 of outer race 22, preferably with approximately equal spacing within each set<br>
of pockets. Pockets 32A and 32B are substantially identical, preferably differing only<br>
in orientation to facilitate actuation of clutch 18. Specifically, each of pockets 32A are<br>
preferably oriented in one direction, while each of pockets 32B are preferably<br>
oriented approximately 180° opposite the orientation of pockets 32 A.<br>
[0022)	Additionally, each of the pockets 32A, 32B are configured and sized to<br>
receive a mating strut 34A, 34B, with each strut 34A, 34B being configured and/or<br>
shaped to engage and/or disengage with an angled well 36 (see Figure 1C) or similar<br>
recess within the inner race 20 as required to respectively allow rotation of the inner<br>
race 20 in either one or both directions, as well as to lock or hold torque in both<br>
directions. First and second arms 12A, 12B are operatively attached to the first and<br>
second selector plates 50, 52, respectively, providing a projection on which a force<br>
external to the outer race 22 may be exerted or directed for moving the selector plates<br>
50, 52 to bring the windows 51 into engagement with the struts 34A, 34B, alternately<br>
depressing and releasing the struts 34A, 34B as needed. When actuated by arms 12A,<br>
12B, respectively, the selector plates 50, 52 each slide or move along the<br>
circumferential groove 56 of outer race 22, with each of the arms 12A, 12B<br>
protruding through an opening or slot 55 in outer wall 35. The first arm 12A is<br>
actuated by a first actuator 42. Likewise, the second selector plate is actuated by a<br>
second actuator 43, with the motion of the arms 12A, 12B represented by the arrows<br>
in Figure IB. The actuators 42, 43 are controlled by the transmission controller 14<br>
and are preferably slide valves of the type known in the art. However, those skilled in<br>
the art will recognize that any mechanism suitable for repositioning first and second<br>
selector plates 50, 52 respectively, along or within circumferential groove 56 may be<br>
used, such as, for example, a piston or motor.<br><br>
6<br>
[0023]	Turning to the table of Figure 2A, three operational modes are shown<br>
for clutch 18 (see Figures 1A-C), with each clutch operational mode defining the<br>
direction of torque holding within the clutch 18. In Mode 1 the clutch 18 is allowed to<br>
"freewheel", i.e. torque is not held in either rotational direction, and permitting for<br>
example inner race 20 to rotate or spin unimpeded within a stationary outer race 22. In<br>
Mode 2, torque is locked or held in one rotational direction. For example, inner race<br>
20 would be permitted to freewheel or rotate unimpeded in a clockwise direction, and<br>
lock or be held from rotating in the counter-clockwise direction. Finally, in Mode 3<br>
the clutch 18 is locked, i.e. torque is held in both rotational directions. Each of the<br>
three operational modes described generally above as applied to clutch 18 are shown<br>
in detail in the fragmentary cross-sectional side views of Figures 2B, 2C, and 2D,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0024]	In each of Figures 2B, 2C, and 2D, wells 32A, 32B are shown with a<br>
substantially vertical locking surface 40 and a sloped surface 41. Vertical locking<br>
surface 40 is configured and/or shaped to oppose a strut 34A, 34B to thereby prevent<br>
rotation in one direction when Modes 2 or 3 are selected (see Figure 2A), while<br>
sloped surface 41 is configured and/or shaped to allow a strut 34A, 34B to be<br>
depressed into a mating pocket 32A, 32B as required and thereby permits relative<br>
rotation of the races 20, 22 in at least one direction, i.e. Modes 1 or 2 (see Figure 2 A).<br>
As shown in Figures 2B, 2C, and 2D, outer race 22 is grounded to the transmission<br>
case 70 and inner race 20 is rotating, inner race 20 being connected to<br>
motor/generator 84, which is in communication with the motor controller 16. Motor<br>
controller 16, as previously described, is configured to synchronize the rotational<br>
speeds of the inner and outer races 20, 22 to facilitate actuation of the clutch 18.<br>
However, in the event outer race 22 is not grounded and therefore is also rotating, the<br>
motor/generator 82 would be likewise connected to the outer race 22 and in<br>
communication with motor controller 16, as shown by the dotted line connection.<br><br>
7<br>
[0025]	In Figure 2B, representing Mode 1 or "freewheeling", first and second<br>
selection plates 50, 52 are positioned by actuators 42, 43, respectively, in response to<br>
a control signal from the transmission controller 14. When repositioned as shown,<br>
first and second selector plates 50, 52 depress each of the required number of struts<br>
34A, 34B into a respective mating well 32A, 32B, with each strut 34A, 34B<br>
compressing a biasing spring 37 to thereby allow inner race 20 to freely rotate or<br>
freewheel in either rotational direction, as represented by arrows 1 and 2. Likewise, in<br>
Figure 2C, representing Mode 2 or torque-holding in a single direction, the first<br>
selector plate 50 is positioned in response to a signal from the transmission controller<br>
14. Biasing springs 37 return any depressed strut 34A to its initial position, thus<br>
engaging the strut 34A with a vertical locking surface 40. Torque is held in one<br>
direction by preventing the inner race 20 from rotating in the direction of arrow 1 due<br>
to the obstructing presence of the strut 34A. The second selector plate 52 continues to<br>
depress strut 34B, allowing inner race 20 to continue to freely rotate in the direction<br>
of arrow 2. Finally, in Figure 2D both first and second selector plates 50, 52 are<br>
repositioned to allow biasing springs 37 to uncompress and return struts 34A, 34B to<br>
their initial, non-depressed state, thereby locking the inner race 20 in both rotational<br>
directions (arrows 1 and 2). While a single strut 34A, 34B is shown in Figures 2B, 2C,<br>
and 2D for illustrative simplicity, for optimal control and performance of clutch 18, a<br>
plurality of struts 34A, 34B is preferred, such as shown in Figure IB.<br>
[0026]	Turning to Figure 3A, a curve is shown plotting differential clutch<br>
speed (As) versus the three clutch operating modes (see Figure 2A) during application<br>
of clutch 18 (see Figures 1A, IB, and 1C). The three operational modes are arranged<br>
sequentially along the X axis, while the Y axis describes the speed differential As as<br>
measured across the disparately rotating inner and outer races 20, 22 (see Figures 1 A,<br>
IB, and 1C). According to the invention, each of the three operational modes, i.e.<br>
Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 3, are selected from according to a measured or otherwise<br>
determined speed differential As determined by speed sensor 11 (see Figure 1 A), with<br>
As also having a positive or negative rotational direction value defined by the relative<br>
rotational direction of the inner and outer races 20, 22.<br><br>
8<br>
[00271	As shown in Figure 3A, while in Mode 1, i.e. "freewheeling", to apply<br>
the clutch 18 the motor controller 16 (see Figures 2A, 2B, and 2C) cycles or<br>
synchronizes the outer and inner races 20, 22 of the clutch 18 so that As approaches<br>
approximately zero revolution per minute, as represented by point 61. The signal<br>
communicated at point 61 precipitates a change from Mode 1 to Mode 2 when the<br>
speed sensor 11 detects that the direction of As reaches a non-negative quantity, i.e. at<br>
point 64, at which point the transmission controller 14 signals the clutch 18 to change<br>
to Mode 2 and thereby hold torque in one rotational direction. Because of the time<br>
delay in making the physical shift by actuation of the required selector plates 50, 52<br>
(see Figure 2C), a slight time lag At occurs before Mode 2 is fully realized at point 65.<br>
While the direction of As is positive, the clutch 18 continues freewheeling. While in<br>
Mode 2, when the direction of As turns negative, i.e. at point 68, the clutch 18 locks.<br>
When the speed sensor 11 detects zero differential clutch speed and zero speed<br>
change, the transmission controller 14 signals the clutch 18 to change to Mode 3 so<br>
that rotational motion is prevented in both directions, as shown in Figure 2D, thereby<br>
freeing or releasing the motor/generators 82, 84 (see Figure 1A) to change speeds as<br>
necessary. Because of the time delay in making the physical shift by actuation of the<br>
required selector plates 50, 52 (see Figure 2D), a slight time lag At occurs before<br>
Mode 3 is fully realized at point 69.<br>
[00281	Turning to Figure 3B, a similar speed curve is shown describing the<br>
release of the clutch 18, beginning with dual-directional torque holding or Mode 3. To<br>
initiate the release of the clutch 18, the transmission controller 14 (see Figures 1A and<br>
1B) commands or signals a mode change from Mode 3 to Mode 2 at point 71. Prior to<br>
a mode change to Mode 2, the motor controller 16 commands or signals the motor to<br>
load the clutch 18 in the direction opposite that of the impending clutch release, then<br>
in Mode 2 the motor controller 16 unloads the clutch 18 so that the clutch 18 may be<br>
easily released (i.e. the struts 34B may be more easily disengaged in Figure 2C) in the<br>
opposite direction. When the speed sensor 11 (see Figure 1A) detects that the quantity<br>
As is positive, the transmission controller 14 changes the operating mode to<br>
"freewheel in both directions", i.e. Mode 1, which is the initial state of Figure 3A as<br>
previously described hereinabove. The actuation cycle then repeats as previously<br>
described hereinabove for Figure 3A.<br><br>
9<br>
[0029]	Turning   now   to   Figure   4A,   a   lever   diagram   is   shown   for   a<br>
representative hybrid transmission 110 having a selectable one-way clutch 180 as<br>
previously described herewithin for clutch 18, the clutch 180 shown in a released or<br>
unapplied state (i.e. Mode 1). The hybrid transmission 110 has a first and second<br>
motor/generator, 182, 184, respectively, an engine 186, and a first and second<br>
planetary gear set 190, 192, respectively. The first and second motor/generators 182<br>
and 184 are controlled by a motor controller 16 (see Figures 1A and 2A-D) as<br>
previously described hereinabove. First planetary gear set 190 comprises a carrier<br>
(node CI), a ring gear (node Rl), and a sun gear (node SI). Likewise, second<br>
planetary gear set 192 comprises a carrier (node C2), a ring gear (node R2), and a sun<br>
gear (node S2). A second clutch 181, which may allow for different gear connections,<br>
is shown in an applied state. First motor/generator 182 is operatively connected to<br>
carrier CI of first planetary gear set 190, which is in turn connected to the sun gear S2<br>
of the secondary planetary gear set 192 . Second motor/generator 184 is connected to<br>
the sun gear SI, which is in turn connected to the ring gear R2 through the second<br>
applied clutch 181. Engine 186 is connected to the ring gear Rl, while the carrier C2<br>
is connected to the clutch output 198. Clutch 180 of the present invention is shown in<br>
the disengaged or unapplied state.<br>
[00301	Dotted lines 200, 201, 202 and 204, 205, and 206 represent various<br>
speed ratios in the unapplied mode, i.e. a range of speed ratios determined by<br>
motor/generator 182. When clutch 180 is applied as previously described<br>
hereinabove, motor/generator 182 cycles or synchronizes the speed across clutch 180<br>
to approximately zero rpm to provide a single fixed speed ratio, as represented by<br>
dotted lines 207 and 208. As shown in Figure 4B, torque is held in both directions, i.e.<br>
clutch 180 is fully applied. While the hybrid transmission 110 shown in Figures 4A<br>
and 4B is one example, those skilled in the art will recognize that various other hybrid<br>
transmission configurations and designs would be operable within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
