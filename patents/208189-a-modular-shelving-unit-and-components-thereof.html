(See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1.	TITLE OF THE INVENTION : 'A modular shelving unit and<br>
components thereof'<br>
2.	APPLICANT<br>
(a)	NAME :	Saifiiddin Shahpurwala &amp;<br>
Murtuza Shahpurwala<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY:	Indian<br>
(c)	ADDRESS :	B-11, Taheri Manzil, Nesbit Road,<br>
Low Level, Mazagaon, Mumbai - 400 010, M.S. India<br>
3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION   The following specification<br>
particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
1.0     Field of Invention :<br>
The present invention relates to a shelving system and in particular, but not exclusively, to modular shelving system suitable for use for example in homes, in offices, in businesses and as product display shelving in shops. This invention pertains generally to furniture, and more particularly to modular shelving and displays, having unique shelving components which may be combined to form a variety of shelving configurations. The present invention relates to the field of shelving for use in homes, offices and workplaces.<br>
2.0	Background of Invention<br>
2.1	Conventional shelving units are built into walls or walls of the<br>
closets or cabinets, with screws and/or nails. Shelves are cut to<br>
closely fit dimensions of wall or closet or cabinet walls. Cutting<br>
shelving components to dimensions is difficult for many<br>
homeowners or operators of small businesses who attempt to<br>
install such shelving at a minimal cost (i.e. avoiding paying a<br>
contractor for installation).<br>
2.2	Many types of shelving are available which span the range in<br>
cost, appearance, and portability. Built-in shelving systems made<br>
of wood ad similar materials are often very attractive. However,<br>
such systems can be expensive to install, often requiring<br>
customized construction for the room in which the shelves are to<br>
be placed. Also, once constructed, built-in shelving systems<br>
2<br><br>
become a permanent feature of the room in which they are placed. Such shelving systems are not portable. While such shelving pieces can be moved, as a practical matter, they are often relatively large pieces of furniture which can be very heavy, unwieldy, undetachable without substantial damage to the material of construction and difficult to transport.<br>
2.3	Ready to assemble products as well as modular shelving products are offered in home improvement centres. Ready to assemble shelving systems come in standard sizes and cannot be adapted to different space requirements.<br>
2.4	Most ready to assemble or "knock-down" shelving systems, and even some built-in shelving systems, allow for adjustment of number of shelves and spacing between shelves in the system. This feature is provided by extending tabs or other structures formed from vertical support structure of shelving system and upon which individual shelves may be placed.<br>
2.5	Beyond the ability to move positions of shelves in the system, a limitation of most modular, conventional shelving systems is that they are often very inflexible with regard to shelving arrangements which can be established, unless one is willing to pay a price for having customized shelves made for a specific space or a specific desired configuration. One is typically limited to selecting from a limited number of shelving arrangements which, in general, cannot be easily configured to an individual space. However modular furniture is furniture that can be modified and changed to meet one's changing requirements over time.<br>
3<br><br>
What is desired, therefore, is a shelving or a cabinet system in which the component parts of the system are easily interchangeable or the system can be expanded to any extent as per the need and availability of space without causing damages to wood such that an unlimited variety of shelving configurations can be formed quickly and easily.<br>
Such a modular shelving system should be able to be implemented inexpensively, and should be easily assembled, disassembled, and reassembled in a variety of configurations by anyone without requiring carpentry skills of any kind.<br>
2.6	The Patent No. EP 0299695 pertains to tubular support structures to which shelves are connected. The cited prior work is different from the present invention, which employs no tubular support.<br>
2.7	The US Patent US5466058 relates to use of modular cubes that connect together with help of various notches and grooves in sides of the cubes to form various configurations. The cited prior work of art can not provide configurational flexibility to devising modular shelving / display units and plurality configurations matching requirements to last milimetre.<br>
2.8	The U.S. Patent No. 4,558,647 relates to a shelving system, comprised of at least 2 no. support beams for 2 no. or more upright members and shelf elements attached to the upright members. The present invention employs no support beams and is built around bent rods, supported from a wall. The present invention is substantially different from the cited prior work.<br>
4<br><br>
2.9	The US Patent No. 4,940,150 relates to constructing a modular storage rack by means of a friction fit. The present invention employs a wall-suspended modular unit that allows plurality choices for precise construction down to a last milimetre.<br>
2.10	The invention in US Patent 6,24,108 works on constructing around 3 no. upright posts, 2 no. tubular members, a positioning groove and a flange-like stopper. The present invention works on 2 no. or plurality of bent rods, a plurality of connector rods, fish plates and support plates. The present invention is different from the cited invention.<br>
2.11	In the US Patent No. 5,421,467 is disclosed a modular shelving unit which is constructed of a pair of support members that have a pair of stacking surfaces, a pair of alignment portions and a pair of alignment cavities. The present invention assembles all components-shelves, cabinets - by means of connector rods, half fish plates and full fish plates and configures them as required. The present invention is different from the cited reference.<br>
2.12	The invention in the US Patent No. (PCT) US 2005039646 is about constructing a modular unit using shelves by means of horizontal through passages. The present invention pertains +o constructing a shelving unit in a precise manner laterally and employing wall suspended assembly constructed around bent rods. The present invention is very different from the cited work.<br>
2.13	The US Patent No. US2002073902 pertains to a shelving unit, employing a pair of side arms for supporting shelves through<br>
5<br><br>
either slots on side arms or from bottom edge. The present invention can configure shelves to any lateral position and is suspended from wall. The present invention is substantially different from the cited work.<br>
2.14	The US Patent No. 6260488 is only a shelving unit, employing hollow 3 no or more poles each of which has a connector, a first post unit and a second post unit. The said post units have a pair of opposite protruding ends. The present invention has none of the said features, is substantially different from the cited work and employs bent rods, connector rods, shelves, cabinets to yield plurality configurations out of available components.<br>
2.15	The US Patent No. 6241108 employs a pair of tubular members out of 3 or more members, having opposite edges, inner circumferential wall, flange like stopper and outwardly inclined surfaces. The present invention employs solid, bent, threaded rods and threaded connector rods for a frame work and goes on to build several configurations down to last milimetre out of available components. The present invention is different from the cited work.<br>
2.16	The US Patent No. 5722544 relates to support posts to which are clipped rear and side panels. Top panel is fixed to slots in support posts and a front panel is attached to prevent objects from falling out. The present invention does not employ slotted support posts and instead works on solid threaded rods, machined shelves, fish plates for firm grip and provides a load carrying capacity of<br>
6<br><br>
around 35 kgs for each shelf. The present invention is quite an improvement over the cited work.<br>
2.17	In the patent GB2317554, elongate rods that are screw fitted form a framework on which shelves, having a tongue-groove inter-fit and/or concealed nut-bolt arrangement for inter-connection and extension, are fitted. The present invention is different from the cited work in terms of building rapidly and easily a framework of bent rods and connector rods over which component shelves and cabinet are slid and are held in place by means of fish plates.<br>
2.18	The US Patent 4558647 relates to upright members forming a base structure. A latticework supported oppositely at edges forms each shelf. The said latticework joins longitudinally 2 no. upright members. The present invention is different in terms of building a frame work of bent rods and connector rods that extends longitudinally and laterally to provide any number of configurations.<br>
2.19	The US Patent 3919950 pertains to hollow cantilever shelves - both ends of which are offset - to provide in L-shape continuous shelves on a wall. The present invention is sturdy in terms of load - bearing capacity, is easy to assemble, provides any number of configurations and eliminates longitudinal and lateral building constraints.<br>
2.20	The US Patent 3964810 relates to using lugs-socket arrangement for securing legs and spacer columns. Shelves have either tracks or grooves for sliding panels. The present invention is different in terms of being wall-supported, of providing a clearance from floor, of building aesthetically attractive configurations out of given components.<br>
7<br><br>

Description of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides a modular shelving system including<br>
its component parts which are easily assembled together to form a<br>
variety of shelving configurations and sizes. A modular shelving<br>
system in accordance with the present invention includes basic<br>
shelving components comprising of structural components which in<br>
accordance with the present invention may inherit both horizontally<br>
and vertically oriented shelf-forming structures in a modular shelving<br>
system in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The structural shelving components are designed in such a manner that they may be joined together easily using the connector shelving components, to form a variety of shelving configurations.<br>
Structural shelving components in accordance with the present invention are preferably formed in the shape of substantially flat boards, which are optionally aligned with the vertical flat face, may or may not formed at right angles thereto. The structural shelving components may be formed in a variety of sizes and may be formed of<br>
14<br><br>
a variety of structural materials e.g. reinforced wood such as rubber wood and have a unique design to suit to the connector components. These shelf components have a unique design, which is more fully described herein after, that makes them compatible with the connector components such as metal plates and fittings thus allowing them to be fixed on the connector shelving components namely, the longitudinal threaded rods firmly.<br>
The connector shelving components, which are herein after more fully described, may be formed in varying sizes without losing their unique design features, which makes the shelving system more flexible. The connector shelving components are made from a variety of materials depending on the strength, affordability and durability. In accordance with the present invention, the connector shelving components are sized and shaped to fit snugly in the apertures formed along the edge surfaces of the structural shelving components, and are designed to work together in a fashion such that the components can be added or removed or reassembled according to the requirements or space constraints.<br>
Further, in accordance with the present invention, structural shelving/cabinet components are joined together using the connector shelving components to form modular shelving of any desired configuration. Such shelving or cabinets are formed by selecting structural shelving components of a desires size and shape, placing the readymade structural shelving components adjacent to each other (face-to-face, edge-to-edge, or edge-to-face) to form the desired shelving configuration and then joining the structural shelving<br>
15<br><br>
components together by inserting connector shelving components such as the bent rod or the straight rod vertically positioned and aligning the basic structural components with connector components and tightening using nuts.<br>
The respective spacing and positioning of the 'U' shaped groove, notches and pin holes on the edges and surfaces of the structural shelving components and the projections extending from the connector shelving component (bottom clamp with notch, fish plate with notch, J clamp, Half fishplate) allow the structural shelving components to be joined together firmly and flexibly to form a variety of shelving configurations.<br>
Structural shelving components and connector shelving components of various sizes and shapes may be made available as individual components, or provided as a kit including a plurality of structural shelving components and connector shelving components in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Further according to the present invention any given configuration of the shelving system can be securely mounted on to the wall by way of screwing the bent rod at the bent side using a lug arrangement as exemplified in the description. The bent rods and straight rods are provided with external threading all along while the rod connector is internally threading enabling it to connect the bent rod to the straight rod. This allows the configuration to start from any height on the wall as any number of straight rods can be attached to the bent rod with the help of the rod connectors. Also as the rods are externally threaded, minute adjustments of height between various structural shelving components are possible.<br>
16<br><br>
According to the present invention the load is distributed between the shelves and the wall through the bent rod, which has two opposite bents within the top 25-30cms as exemplified in the description. Moreover, with the shelving system of the present invention each structural shelving component is capable of withstanding approximately 60 Kg force when attached to the wall with the help of the connector shelving components.<br>

6.2	Each of the connector shelving components and the said structural<br>
17<br><br>
shelving   component   are   described   herein   after   in   following paragraphs. 6.3     Bent rod<br>
6.3.1	The bent rod consists of threaded rods having invert bends. The first bend possess an angle of 120 degrees and the second bend possesses an angle of 90 degrees, minimum length of the bent rod is 15 inches.<br>
6.3.2	After both the bends the minimum cross-sectional length of the bent rod itself is approximately 15 inches. The bent rod helps to anchor the shelving unit to the wall.<br>
6.3.3	The tow bends in the rod acts as a spring pressing the shelves and cabinets of the modular system to the wall.<br>
6.3.4	This also helps transfer the weight of the shelves and cabinets as well as the items put on the shelves on to the wall helping to greatly enhance the load bearing capacity of the system.<br>
6.3.5	In conjunction with the other connector shelving components the bent rod allow weights of up to 60Kgs to be suspended on each 18mm solid wood structural shelving components.<br>
6.3.6	The bent rod is threaded with threads possessing a distance of one mm each. The threading in the bent rod allows the shelves and cabinet positions to be adjusted to an accuracy of 1mm up or down.<br>
6.3.7	The bent rod is at a distance of 7.5 in from the wall. This serves the purpose of securely anchoring shelves and cabinets possessing depths between 9 to 21 inches to the wall.<br>
6.3.8	A bent rod (1.1) is uniformly threaded in its entire length to a thread size of 1 mm, has an invert bend of 120 degrees (3.1) and a second invert bend of 90 degrees (3.2), as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 3. It is at least about 38 centimeters long and is mounted on<br>
18<br><br>
a wall by means of a lug (1.3) and a coach screw. A shelving panel (1.) and a cabinet (112) are mounted on a bent rod by means of the said fixtures. 6.4     Straight rod:<br>
6.4.1	The straight rod (1.2) is a longitudinal threaded rod possessing external threads at a distance of 1 mm each.<br>
6.4.2	In cases where the structural shelving components exceed the height of the bent rod, the straight rod is attached to the bent rod with the help of a connector shelving component, specifically the rod connector, the description of which is given later.<br>
6.4.3	Thus the straight rod, along with the bent rod and rod connector allow the shelving configuration to start from any height required.<br>
6.4.4	In cases where the bent rod is not used, straight rods acts as direct vertical support which acts as a base with the help of another fitting, specifically the floor mount.<br>
6.4.5	Since these rods possess threads of one mm each this enables the shelving panel to be fitted at any distance on the threaded rods with the help of the rest of the fittings like bottom clamp with notch, half fish plate, fish plate with a notch and J clamp.<br>
6.4.6	Minimum length of the said rod is approx 100 cm in length.<br>
6.4.7	Straight rod (1.2) is straight, uniformly threaded in its entire length to a thread size of 1 mm - as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 5/26 - and is at least 100 centimeters long. The said shelving panel (1.9) and the said cabinet (1.10) are mounted on the said straight rod (1.2) by means of a half fish plate (2.1), a fish plate with a notch (2.2) or<br>
19<br><br>
a J clamp (1.4) and a bottom clamp with a notch (1.5). 6.5       Lug:<br>
6.5.1	Lug (1.3) is a cylindrical structure attached to a circular flattened plate. The cylindrical structure is internally threaded.<br>
6.5.2	The lug is used for anchoring the bent rod to the wall. The internal diameter of the cylindrical portion is 8mm and the outer diameter is 14 mm.<br>
6.5.3	The internal hole drilled in the flattened rotund portion is of 7.5 mm diameter. The cylindrical portion is perpendicular to the flat circular portion.<br>
6.5.4	The circular portion is flat in shape with an aperture in the center to allow a coach screw to pass through it which helps it in anchoring it to the wall.<br>
6.5.5	The bent rod is attached by the lug to the wall. Since the cylindrical portion of the lug is threaded internally it allows the bent rod to get attached to it easily.<br>
6.5.6	The lugs are fitted in a vertical position parallel to the wall. The coach screw is of 3 inches which is screwed into the wall through these lugs.<br>
6.5.7	The Function of the lug is to attach the bent rod to the wall.<br>
6.5.8	The said lug (1.3) is illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 7/26, has a base (7.2) which is a circular flat plate having a central hole (7.4). Neck (7.1) of the said lug (1.3) is cylindrical in shape, internally threaded in its entire length. The said threading is extended to the bottom end of the said base (7.2). The said neck (7.1) forms an almost 180 degrees angle to the said base (7.2) of the said lug (1.3). The said hole (7.4) is utilized for fixing the said lug (1.3) on a wall<br>
20<br><br>

21<br><br>
6.6.9	The J clamp is used to attach the structural shelving components to the bent and straight rods and is used where no two structural shelving components are attached to each other.<br>
6.6.10	The J clamp works in tandem with another connector shelving component, namely the Half Fish Plate.<br>
6.6.11	J clamp (1.4) is made of a metal, one-half of which is semi-circular<br><br>
(9.2)	in shape and the other half of which is rectangular (9.5) in shape, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 9/26. The said rectangular half (9.5) is bent, at a point half way of its shorter side, vertically upward at an angle of 90 degrees with respect to the said semi-circular half (9.2). A T-shaped notch (9.3) is carved out, running parallel to the said bent part (9.5), firstly from circumference for half the length of the base of the said semi-circular half (9.2) to the centre point of the said semi-circular half (9.2), and secondly in perpendicular direction right up to the base of the said bent part (9.5). Looking from top, the said J notch (9.3) is a mirror-image of the letter T. The base of the said J notch (9.3) has a pair of semi-circular ends to accommodate and to hold the said bent rod (1.1) and the said straight rod (1.2). The said curved end of the base of the said J notch<br>
(9.3)	is extended on the vertically upward plane of the said bent part (9.5). At each end of the base of the said semi-circular half (9.2) is carved a rectangular notch (9.1), in the direction away from the said base of the semi-circular half (9.2), measuring in size approximately same as the width of the said J-notch. The said rectangular notches (9.1) end in vertical projections, having teeth-like edges. The semi¬circular half (9.2) has a central ridge (9.4), running the entire radius in the direction perpendicular to the base of the said semi-circular half<br>
22<br><br>
(9.2) from the centre of the said semi-circular base (9.2) to the circumference. The said ridge (9.4) provides additional strength to the said J clamp (1.4). The vertical plane (9.5) acts as a vertical support, while the said half-circular plane (9.2) together with J-shaped notch serves as a base plate for supporting the said shelving panel (1.9). 6.7     Half Fish Plate (2.1)<br>
6.7.1	The half fish plate is an elongated horse shoe shaped like structure where the semi circular portion is 3.18 cms in width and the length of the portion is 3.5 cms in length bearing thickness of 1.4 mm thickness.<br>
6.7.2	It has a hole drilled into the centre towards the front semi circular portion having 3 mm diameter. This allows it to be screwed to the U shaped groove on the top edge of the structural shelving component.<br>
6.7.3	The half fish plate is used in shelves where no two structural shelving components are attached to each other.<br>
6.7.4	The half fish plate has a U shaped notch which allows the longitudinal threaded rod to pass through it.<br>
6.7.5	The half fish plate is fitted on the upper side of the structural shelving component and on the edge of the shelving panel and doesn't allow the rod to move.<br>
6.7.6	The half fish plate is fitted on the pre designed U shaped grooves made on the structural shelving component. The pre designed grooves are constructed on the top linear edge of the transverse shelving panel.<br>
6.7.7	The Half fish plate works in conjunction with the J Clamp which is fitted on the bottom of the shelving panel and is used in that part of the shelving configuration where no two structural shelving components are joined together.<br>
23<br><br>
6.7.8 As illustrated in the accompanying diagram 11/26, a half fish plate (2.1) is a square-shaped plate with one side extended to a semi-circle of a diameter equal to a side of the said square. The said semi-circular head has a central hole, positioned closer towards the circumference than the diameter of the said semi-circle. The said square portion has a semi-circular notch on the side opposite to the said extended semi¬circular head. It is fitted into a U-shaped groove on the upper side at the edge of the said shelving panel (1.9) and works in tandem with the said J clamp (1.4), fitted on the underside of the said structural shelving panel (1.9). The function of half fish (2.1) is to allow a threaded rod to pass through its said semi-circular notch and to hold in place, in tandem with J clamp, the structural shelving panel (1.9). It is used on the side of the said structural shelving panel (1.9) to which no other shelving panel is connected.<br>
6.8    Bottom Clamp with Notch (1.5)<br>
6.8.1	This is a rectangular clamp having 4 teeth each 7 mm in height on either side of the plate.<br>
6.8.2	The distance between the two centre teeth is 5.08 cms and that between the teeth at the center and the teeth at the end of the plate is 3.18 cms.<br>
6.8.3	It has a 0.9 cm wide notch in the centre of the plate extending 3 cms from the edge of the plate into the middle of the plate.<br>
6.8.4	The teeth snugly fit into predesigned grooves on one of the adjoining edges on the lower side of the transverse shelving panels.<br>
6.8.5	The three cm groove has been designed to allow the clamp to slip onto the bent or straight rods.<br>
24<br><br>
6.8.6	The longitudinal threaded rod passes through U shaped groove so as to adjoin two transverse shelving panels.<br>
6.8.7	There are two 5mm wide ridges running parallel to each other at distance of 3 cms from each other.<br>
6.8.8	These ridges help in increasing it from bending or going out of shape.<br>
6.8.9	Thus the Bottom Clamp with notch helps to join two structural shelving components together onto the rod. It works in tandem with the fish plate with notch.<br>
6.8.10	Two nuts one from the top of the structural shelving components and one from the bottom are tightened onto the fish plate with notch and the bottom clamp with notch from the top and bottom respectively helping these connector shelving components attach the structural shelving components firmly to the threaded rods.<br>
6.8.11	Bottom clamp with notch (1.5) is a rectangular plate, having 4 no. notches on its each longer side. Each notch of the said 8 no. notches rises at its base as a projection (13.1) of the size equal to that of the notch itself, as illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 13/26. At the mid-point of a longer side of the said rectangular plate is a carved out a U-shaped groove (13.2), which extends past the central longitudinal axis of the said rectangular plate. There is on either side of the said central longitudinal axis a longitudinal ridge (13.3), equidistant between the said central longitudinal axis and the said longer side and running from inside of the first said projection to the inside of the last projection, as illustrated in the said accompanying drawing # 13/26.<br>
6.9       Fish Plate with Notch (2.2)<br>
6.9.1    It works in conjunction with the Bottom Clamp with notch.<br>
25<br><br>
6.9.2	It is a base plate of horizontally elliptical shape bearing a U shaped notch of 2.1 cm in length &amp; 0.9 cms in width provided at one of the straight surfaces to releasably secure the longitudinal threaded rod being fixed by means of a nut.<br>
6.9.3	The said fitting is further fitted on predesigned U shaped concentric grooves to enable the fish pate with notch to be fitted firmly on the inset grooves as a result of which the rod is preventing from shifting its position.<br>
6.9.4	Fish plate with notch (2.2) is illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 15/26. It is a plate of rectangular shape with the shorter sides extending into semi-circles. One longer side has a U-shaped notch, extending past the centre of the said rectangle. Fish plate with notch (2.2) works in tandem with bottom clamp with notch (1.5). The said U-shaped notch secures threaded straight rod (1.2). Fish plate with notch (2.2) is firmly fitted in U-shaped concentric grooves on structural shelving panel (1.9).<br>
6.10     Rod Connector (1.6)<br>
6.10.1	This is a powder coated metal cylinder 3.18 cms in length with an internal diameter of 8 mm and outer diameter of 14 mm, threaded from the inside.<br>
6.10.2	The rod connector is used to connect the straight rod to the bent rod thus helping to increase the length of the rod, as the bent rod, if used in long lengths can be inconvenient for handling purposes.<br>
6.10.3	The rod connector thus allows the shelving assembly to be flexible in the sense that if there is just one level of shelving assembly the rod connector need not be used for joining the straight rod.<br>
6.10.4	Since the internal diameter of the threaded rod is of 8 mm and the outer diameter of 14 mm the two end prolusions of the straight rod<br>
26<br><br>
and the bent rod are connected securely in an upward vertical<br>
longitudinal direction by the rod connector. 6.10.5  Rod connector (1.6) is illustrated in the accompanying diagram #<br>
17/26. It is a hollow cylinder, internally threaded through its entire<br>
length and serves to connect a bent rod (1.1) with a straight rod (1.2)<br>
for extending height of a display unit. 6.11     Floor Mount (1.7)<br>
6.11.1	The floor mount is a tripod like structure used as a support base for the straight rod in configurations where the structural shelving components are attached only to a straight rod and not to the bent rod.<br>
6.11.2	In one embodiment of the invention the floor mount is specifically used to create a strong rigid support from the bottom so as to create a balanced distribution of weight.<br>
6.11.3	The floor mount acts as an additional support base only in shelving configurations which do not possess bent rods inserted from top in the centre, i.e. where bent rods are used only at the extreme edges of the shelving assembly to provide unhindered top panel space to a user.<br>
6.11.4	The internal diameter of the cylindrical vertical portion of the floor mount is 8 mm and an outer diameter is 14 mm. the length of the cylindrical portion is 4.13 cm and the individual flanges possess length of 2 cms and breadth of 1.3 cms.<br>
6.11.5	Floor mount (1.7) is illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 19/26. It is a tripod with a hollow cylindrical head, internally threaded through entire length. Floor mount (1.7) is used for constructing display units, where bent rod (1.1) or plurality thereof are used at edges instead of as central supports from wall. It provides an alternate support to a display unit from floor and facilitates construction thereof<br>
27<br><br>
from bottom end. Each of 3 no. legs of Floor Mount (1.7) has a hole through which is secured the entire display unit to floor.<br>
6.12	Support Plate (1.8)<br>
6.12.1	The support plate is an L shaped structure used in shelving unit assembly to provide additional weight bearing capacity to the structural shelving components resting on the wall.<br>
6.12.2	The said plate consist of two portions, a lower broad horizontal base plate of depth 5.08 cm and length of 12.7 cms wherein the broader plate is perpendicularly aligned to the relatively narrow plate of depth 2.54 cms.<br>
6.12.3	The two plates are attached to each other so as to form a 90 degree angle.<br>
6.12.4	The broader plate/segment has an aperture drilled in the centre while the narrow segment plate has two holes drilled into it to enable the screws to be pass through the said holes.<br>
6.12.5	The support plate is fitted at the bottom of the shelving panel. The main advantage of the support plate is that it provides additional support and strength to the shelving unit assembly and also fixes the assembly to the wall.<br>
6.12.6	Support plate (1.8) is illustrated in the accompanying drawing # 21/26. It is a metal plate, L-shaped, has a hole (21.4) in the broad head (21.1) and has a pair of holes (21.5) in the narrow base (21.2). The ratio of the said head (21.1) in width to the said narrow base (21.2) in width is 2:1.
