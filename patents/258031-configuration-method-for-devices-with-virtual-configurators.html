				<td>CONFIGURATION   METHOD   FOR   DEVICES   WITH   VIRTUAL<br>
CONFIGURATORS<br>
The present invention relates to a configuration method<br>
for devices such as actuators, controls, dimmers, etc.,<br>
with virtual configurators.<br>
In current domotic devices and systems, configuration<br>
is often provided by command devices, performed by a<br>
set of actuator devices through a self-learning message<br>
stage.<br>
As an example, a typical schematic configuration of a<br>
self-learning domotic system comprises a command device<br>
conceived to transmit specific programming messages to<br>
devices such as actuators, controls, dimmers, etc.,<br>
destined to control determined loads such as  the<br>
lighting in a room or a complete apartment, and/or<br>
activating systems of the type used to open and close<br>
rolling shutters.<br>
This procedure consists of setting the actuator devices<br>
in programming mode,  for example, through prolonged<br>
pressure on a determined key followed by the successive<br>
transmission of the message to be memorised by the<br>
command device.<br>
A signal LED diode can be used to indicate the<br>
programming status (for example: switch-on) and the<br>
confirmation that the command has been memorised (for<br>
2<br><br>
example: switch-off).<br>
This operation must be repeated for each command<br>
message programming procedure on each actuator device<br>
and each actuator device is able to store several<br>
command messages.<br>
If the key is pressed for a longer period, this can<br>
zero-set the memory of the programmed controls, once<br>
again indicated by a signal LED diode, such as a<br>
temporary flashing action, for example.<br>
At present, dombtic systems exist that are based on<br>
electric  buses,  which  however  generally  assign<br>
addresses by means of configuration numeric selectors,<br>
microswitch.es or bonds. .<br>
Basically, in this case, a command device is connected<br>
to an electric bus, to which the actuator devices are<br>
also connected;  the controls  send the activating<br>
signals through a bus to the actuators, which are also<br>
directly connected to the respective loads such as<br>
lighting and/or electric motors.<br>
The command device and the actuator devices also<br>
possess numeric selectors that can be used to assign<br>
addresses.<br>
3<br><br>
For example, US 2003/086111 discloses a configuration method for devices connected to a bus system building a system control service (SCS) installation such that devices connected to the bus system are identified by their configuration allowing also a reconfiguration changing device parameters and also a change in the function logic of the connected devices. However, in US 2003/086111, contrary to the present invention, said reconfigurations, changes in the function logic, and also the set up of an initial configuration have to be manually performed by opening the device casing, shutting off the system power, and reloading a mew program into the devices since no addressable, hence virtual, configurators are present in the above-mentioned prior art document.<br>
The aim of the present invention therefore, is to propose a new SCS system configuration method, able to integrate with systems based on two wire SCS buses,<br>
that  will  permit  the  configuration  of  devices<br>
(actuators,   controls,   etc.),   through   virtual<br>
configuration stored in a memory inside the device<br>
itself.<br>
Another aim of the present invention is to create a<br>
configuration method for devices, such as actuators,<br>
controls, dimmers, etc., with virtual configurators,<br>
that allows the installer to choose between configuring an SCS installation using physical configurators, or by using a PDA or a PC or similar equipment.<br><br>
Yet another aim of the present invention is to provide a configuration method for devices with virtual configurators, that are easy to install and use, and that are also efficient, safe and reliable. These and other aims, according to the present invention, are achieved by providing a new configuration method for devices with virtual configurators, according to the appended claim 1; the subordinate claims contain detailed technical characteristics of the invention.<br>
Advantageously, the new method for configuration devices such as actuators, controls, dimmers, etc., of a domotic system bus, in "virtual" mode, can be realised using a PDA or a PC or similar equipment, by pressing appropriate keys on the device to be configured, or by entering the device address of the device to be configured on the PDA or PC. This provides remarkable mobility levels within the installation; and above all it is also possible to reconfigure devices which are not accessible, simply by knowing the address. It is also possible to perform diagnostics of the whole installations through a PDA, PC or similar equipment.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the configuration method for devices with virtual configurators, according to the present invention, will be made more apparent in the following description, provided as an example, but by no means limitative, with reference to an embodiment and the appended drawing (figure 1) which shows a block diagram outline of said configuration method, according to the invention.<br>
Â£<br><br>
In the aforesaid figure that demonstrates the technical characteristics of the configuration system, according to the invention, the numeral 10 refers to a PDA or a Personal Computer (PC), that is connected to a two wire SCS bus 11, through a radio frequency connection 12, such as WiFi, for example,- said solution also requires the use of a web server 14 such as OPEN-SCS gateway, connected to an Ethernet line 15, in turn equipped with<br>
Wi-Fi a receiver/transmitter (access point) 13. In order to set up the virtual configuration, the installer has a case containing a PDA or a PC 10, web server 14 and a Wi-Fi access point 13; the PDA seems to be the best instrument for the configuration operations because it is handy to use and easily portable, since it has remarkable mobility inside the installation with an extremely good signal coverage (80 metres in obstruction-free space). However, an alternative method is to use a PC instead of the PDA to perform virtual configuration, with the same function and similar software.<br>
User interfaces other than PDA or PC can also be used. The virtual configuration method that can be applied according to the invention is as follows (it should be noted that a configuration method using a PDA has been presented as an example, even though the function can be performed in the same manner by a PC or another similar user interface).<br>
b<br><br>
After connecting all devices 16, such as actuators,<br>
controls, dimmers, etc., and after connecting the PDA<br>
10 to the two wire SCS bus 11, the installer has only<br>
to connect the installation to the main power supply,<br>
and the installation configuration stage can be started<br>
using the PDA 10.<br>
Practically speaking, the installer simply presses a<br>
key on the device 16 to be configured, and following<br>
this a message will appear on the PDA 10.<br>
The  software  present on    the  PDA  10  possesses  a<br>
database,  containing the files of all the domotic<br>
devices 16 present inside a determined catalogue.<br>
The installer is given the choice whether to use the<br>
guided configuration method, or whether he prefers a<br>
general configuration method.<br>
In the first case, the PDA 10 software recognises the<br>
device 16 which is being configured, because it is<br>
contained in the database, and therefore proposes guide<br>
instructions for configuration; for example,  the seat<br>
of the configurators is displayed as it is presented on<br>
the device in question, thus confining the selection<br>
exclusively to the consented configurators.<br>
In the second case, the device 16 is not yet contained<br>
in the product catalogue database, and therefore, the<br>
installer can follow a general configuration procedure<br>
where  he  is  completely  free  to  choose  which<br>
configurators  he prefers;  in  this  situation,  the<br>
installer is also given the possibility of adding the<br>
relevant device 16 to the database.<br>
Once the configurators have been entered in the PDA 10,<br>
the installer confirms the operation.<br>
7<br><br>
At  this point,  the confirmation of  the completed configuration will appear on the PDA 10, or an error signal will appear in the case where the entered configuration is incorrect, for example. Once this stage has been completed, the installer can decide whether he will terminate the configuration stage or continue, and if this is the case, he must repeat the procedure described previously, pressing the key of the new device 16 to be configured. Naturally,   a  control   check  on  the  physical configurators is made upstream, and if present, the whole procedure will be blocked with a message that appears on the PDA display.<br>
This procedure can also be used to reconfigure devices 16, which have been previously configured using virtual configurators; in this case, when the key of the device 16 to be configured is pressed, the PDA 10 display will show a screen with the configuration to be modified, and the installer is able to enter the desired configuration on the PDA 10, confirming the procedure, and then he is able to continue as described previously.<br>
The PDA 10 can also be used to request the configuration of a device 16 by pressing the appropriate  key;  the  PDA  10  will  display  the<br>
8<br><br>
configuration, specifying whether the configurators are physical or virtual.<br>
In the case of devices 16 previously configured using virtual configurators, and therefore, addressable, reconfiguration can be performed by remote control and/or off-line; the installer can set up the configuration of an installation from his own office, save the configuration and use it when he needs to visit the installation in question.<br>
In this case, the application program should permit installation configuration saving in standard format (such as an . xml file), s tor able in mass memory, such as compact flash or secure digital modules, that can also be left at the customer's location, and which make future interventions on the installation by installers, PTC, and technical assistance, much more convenient. Installation configuration could also be saved on a determined Internet gateway.<br>
Lastly, as mentioned before, the PDA 10 software can also be used to detect the configuration perform diagnostics on an installation already running; for example, it is possible to scan the whole installation to detect any possible faulty devices 16. In this way, wiring is identical for any type of installation, and the function logic (zoned function,<br><br>
^   &gt;<br><br>
direct command of a single device, direct command of all devices in the same environment, logic connections between devices belonging to different environments, direct command of all devices belonging to a same group, direct command of all devices) is established through the configuration of the various devices 16 identified, to which specific operating methods and/or functions to be performed are assigned. This can be varied at any time without physical intervention on the wiring.<br>
Moreover, in the specific case of virtual configuration, a device can be reconfigured without having to access the configurators (an operation which, in the case of built-in devices for example, necessarily involves opening the device casing), and without having to shut off and reconnect the power supply to the system.<br>
The characteristics of the configuration method of devices with virtual configurators, object of the present invention, have been made clear by the aforesaid description, as have the apparent advantages. Lastly, it is obvious that numerous variants can be applied to the configuration method in question, while remaining within the innovative context of the invention, and it is also obvious that in the practical<br><br>
embodiment of the invention, all materials, shapes and sizes of the components illustrated can be of any type according to necessity, and can be replaced by others that are technically equivalent.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
