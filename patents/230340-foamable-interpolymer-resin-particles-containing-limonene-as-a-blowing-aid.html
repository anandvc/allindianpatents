FOAMABLE INTERPOLYMER RESIN PARTICLES CONTAINING<br>
LIMONENE AS A BLOWING AID<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to foamable<br>
interpolymer resin particles comprised of<br>
polyolefins, e.g.polyethylene, and polymerized vinyl<br>
aromatic resin. More particularly, the present<br>
invention relates to foamable interpolymer resin<br>
particles comprised of a volatile blowing agent<br>
ranging from between about 1.5% to about 20 wt%<br>
based on the weight of the particles and 0.1 to<br>
about 5 parts, preferably 0.1 to 1.0 part, by weight<br>
limonene, based on 100 parts by weight of the<br>
foamable interpolymer resin particles, as a<br>
plasticizer or blowing aid.<br>
2 . Background Art<br>
It is known to polymerize a vinyl aromatic<br>
monomer, such as styrene, within polyethylene<br>
particles. U.S. Patent No. 3,959,189, issued to<br>
Kitamori and assigned to Sekisui Kaseihin Kabushiki<br>
Kaisha, discloses a process for producing<br>
polyethylene resin particles which comprises<br>
suspending in an aqueous medium polyethylene resin<br>
particles, adding to the suspension 30 to 100% by<br>
weight based on the weight of the particles of a<br>
styrene monomer and an initiator for polymerizing<br>
the monomer, and polymerizing the monomer inside the<br>
polyethylene resin particles. The particles can<br>
then be made foamable by impregnating them with a<br>
blowing agent, preferably after the polymerization<br>
of the styrene monomer and the cross-linking of the<br>
polyethylene resin. The blowing agent generally is a<br>
volatile blowing agent, i.e. aliphatic hydrocarbons<br><br>
It would be desirable to use a blowing aid that<br>
is not considered to be a hazardous air pollutant<br>
and that does not have an offensive odor while still<br>
providing excellent foamability and molding<br>
fusability properties.<br>
It is known to use d-limonene to improve the<br>
expandability of primarily styrene-containing<br>
expandable polymers. Examples are JP 08208877 (open<br>
for public inspection application August 13, 1996)<br>
to Sekisui Plastics, Japan; JP 07309968 (granted JP<br>
30609839 on July 10, 2000) to Achilles Corp., Japan;<br>
and JP 93202250A to Asahi Chemical Industry Co.,<br>
Ltd. (Hei5-202250).<br>
The use of limonene in styrene as a plasticizer<br>
or as a tackifier is further exemplified in: U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,222,378; EP 0 701 589 Bl (The Dow<br>
Chemical Co.) which is also WO 94/19383<br>
(PCT/US94/06112); and U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,959,412(Arizona Chemical Company).<br>
JP 11080412 (Achilles Corporation) (Entitled:<br>
"Heat-resistant cellular styrene polymer-<br>
polyoxyphenylene") teaches the use of limonene in a<br>
blend of styrenic resin and a polyphenylene ether-<br>
based resin. The abstract teaches that the<br>
particles contain 3-15 parts volatile blowing agent-<br>
impregnated polymer particles consisting of 50-90<br>
parts styrene polymers and 10-50 parts<br>
poly(phenylene ethers) and 0.1-5 parts (for 100<br>
parts polymer particles) limonene. A composition<br>
containing polystyrene, poly(phenylene ether),<br>
ethylenebis(stearamide), pentane, and limonene was<br>
extruded, pelletized, and molded to give a test<br><br>
piece showing good heat resistance with short<br>
molding cycle time. It is stated that the addition<br>
of limonene in the base resin can improve the<br>
foaming ability of the base resin, and the molding<br>
time and cooling time can be shortened.<br>
The prior art does not provide for interpolymer<br>
particles comprising a polyolefin, e.g. polyethylene<br>
and an in situ polymerized vinyl aromatic resin<br>
forming an interpenetrating network of polyolefin<br>
and vinyl aromatic resin particles, and which<br>
particles contain a blowing aid that is not<br>
considered to be a hazardous air pollutant; that is<br>
considered as having a pleasant smell; and that is<br>
more effective as a blowing aid or plasticizer than<br>
those of the prior art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention overcomes the above-described<br>
disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
The present invention provides foamable<br>
interpolymer resin particles comprised from about<br>
20% to about 80% by weight of a polyolefin and from<br>
about 80% to about 20% by weight of a polymerized<br>
vinyl aromatic resin which form an interpenetrating<br>
network of polyolefin and vinyl aromatic resin<br>
particles. The foamable interpolymer resin<br>
particles are impregnated with a volatile<br>
hydrocarbon blowing agent and limonene as a blowing<br>
aid or plasticizer. Limonene is not considered to<br>
be a hazardous air pollutant; has a pleasant citrus<br>
smell; and improves the expandability of the<br>
interpolymer particles.<br><br>
3 to 15 parts by weight of a blowing agent and 0.5<br>
to 5 parts by weight of a blowing aid to 100 parts<br>
by weight of polyolefin particles. Column 2, lines<br>
63-66, teach that the blowing aid causes the<br>
interior of the particles to be in a plastic state<br>
to facilitate the foaming of the particles.<br>
Representative blowing aids used as a plasticizer<br>
are benzene, toluene, xylene, trichlene, perchlene,<br>
cyclohexane, carbon tetrachloride, etc.<br>
The particles of the prior art are impregnated<br>
with a blowing agent, or in the instance of the<br>
aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 4,429,059 with a blowing<br>
agent and a blowing aid. The blowing agents are<br>
generally "volatile" hydrocarbons, and the blowing<br>
aids are generally considered as hazardous air<br>
pollutants (HAPS), as found in the 1990 Federal<br>
Clean Air Act Amendments, Section 112. The blowing<br>
agents and blowing aids generally are emitted into<br>
the environment during the processing and foaming of<br>
the particles. Both the producer and the converter<br>
of the particles may be forced to reduce the<br>
emissions to acceptable regulatory levels, which<br>
would involve investing in complicated equipment for<br>
collecting the emitted hydrocarbons. The number of<br>
foamable particles and foamed articles produced in a<br>
given time will be dependent on the permissible<br>
regulatory levels for hydrocarbon emissions in a<br>
given geographical area. A further disadvantage<br>
with the types of blowing aids taught in the<br>
aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 4,429,059, e.g. toluene,<br>
benzene, etc. is the associated offensive smell<br>
during processing of the foamable particles.<br><br>
The foamable interpolymer particles can be<br>
produced by suspending in an aqueous medium<br>
polyolefin particles; preferably adding a cross-<br>
linking agent to the polyolefin particles and from<br>
about 25% to about 400%, preferably 80% to 400%, by<br>
weight of vinyl aromatic monomer or monomer mixtures<br>
based on the weight of the polyolefin particles;<br>
adding a polymerization initiator to polymerize the<br>
vinyl aromatic monomer or monomer mixtures within<br>
the polyolefin particles to form an interpenetrating<br>
network of polyolefin and vinyl aromatic resin<br>
particles. The interpolymer particles are<br>
impregnated with a volatile, hydrocarbon blowing<br>
agent in an amount ranging from about 1.5% to about<br>
20% by weight, preferably 1.5% to 15 % by weight,<br>
and more preferably, 5% to 15% by weight, based on<br>
the weight of the interpolymer particles, and<br>
limonene in an amount ranging from about 0.1 to<br>
about 5 parts, preferably 0.1 to about 1.0 part<br>
based on 100 parts by weight of interpolymer<br>
particles.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention,<br>
there is provided foamable interpolymer resin<br>
particles comprised of: about 20% to about 80% by<br>
weight polyolefin, preferably, cross-linked, and<br>
from about 80% to about 20% by weight of a<br>
polymerized vinyl aromatic resin, which form an<br>
interpenetrating network of polyolefin and vinyl<br>
aromatic resin particles; a blowing agent ranging<br>
from about 1.5% to about 20% by weight, preferably<br>
1.5% to 15% by weight, and more preferably 5% to 15%<br>
by weight, based on the weight of the foamable<br><br>
interpolymer particles; and from about 0.1 to about<br>
5 parts, preferably 0.1 to about 1 part (for 100<br>
parts interpolymer particles) of limonene, as a<br>
plasticizer or blowing aid.<br>
The use of limonene in the invention allows the<br>
blowing agent level to be reduced in the processing<br>
of the interpolymer particles and therefore the<br>
blowing agent level in the particles per se is<br>
reduced. This is particularly important when a<br>
volatile hydrocarbon blowing agent, e.g. pentane is<br>
used as a blowing agent in view of the environmental<br>
issues, e.g. emissions of the blowing agent,<br>
discussed hereinabove in the prior art section.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymerized<br>
vinyl aromatic resin is vinyl aromatic homopolymers,<br>
preferably, polystyrene, or polymerized vinyl<br>
aromatic copolymers, preferably, poly)styrene-butyl<br>
acrylate), and the polyolefin is polyethylene.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present<br>
invention to provide foamable interpolymer resin<br>
particles comprising a blowing agent and limonene as<br>
a blowing aid or plasticizer which combination<br>
results in improved expandability of the resin<br>
particles in order to form articles with at least<br>
improved physical properties compared to that of the<br>
prior art.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention<br>
to eliminate the offensive odor generally associated<br>
with particles that contain hazardous air<br>
pollutants, such as toluene, benzene, etc. as a<br>
blowing aid in the impregnation of the blowing agent<br>
in the particles.<br><br>
These and other objects of the present<br>
invention will be better appreciated and understood<br>
by those skilled in the art from the following<br>
description and appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The interpolymer particles of the invention are<br>
comprised of polyolefin and in situ polymerized<br>
vinyl aromatic resin that form an interpenetrating<br>
network of polyolefin and vinyl aromatic resin<br>
particles. The interpolymer particles are<br>
impregnated with a blowing agent and limonene as a<br>
plasticizer or blowing aid.<br>
Such interpolymer particles can be obtained by<br>
processes described in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,959,189 and in U.S. Patent No. 4,168,353<br>
(Kitamori), both assigned to Sekisui Kaseihin Kogyo<br>
Kabushiki Kaisha. The process comprises suspending<br>
polyolefin particles and vinyl aromatic monomer or<br>
monomer mixtures in an aqueous suspension and<br>
polymerizing the monomer or monomer mixtures inside<br>
the polyolefin particles. The teachings of U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,959,189 and 4,168,353 are incorporated<br>
herein in their entirety by reference, except for<br>
the use of solvent in the impregnation step,<br>
examples of which include toluene, benzene, 1,2-<br>
dichloropropane, etc. The present invention<br>
particularly sets out to eliminate the use of HAPS<br>
chemicals, such as toluene and benzene, as a solvent<br>
or as a blowing aid.<br>
The term "polyolefin" as used herein is a<br>
plastic, which is prepared from at least one<br>
olefinic monomer, such as ethylene, propylene,<br><br>
butene, hexane or octane. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the polyolefin is polyethylene.<br>
The term "polyethylene" as used herein includes<br>
not only a homopolymer of ethylene, but also an<br>
ethylene copolymer composed of at least 5 0 mole %,<br>
preferably at least 70 mole %, of an ethylene unit<br>
and a minor proportion of a monomer copolymerizable<br>
with ethylene, and a blend of at least 50% by<br>
weight, preferably at least 60% by weight, of the<br>
ethylene homopolymer or copolymer with another<br>
polymer.<br>
Examples of monomers copolymerizable with<br>
ethylene are vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride,<br>
propylene, butene, hexene, acrylic acid and its<br>
esters, methacrylic acid and its esters. The other<br>
polymer that can be blended with the ethylene<br>
homopolymer or copolymer may be any polymer<br>
compatible with it. Examples are polypropylene,<br>
polybutadiene, polyisoprene, polychloroprene,<br>
chlorinated polyethylene, polyvinyl chloride, a<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymer, a vinyl<br>
acetate/ethylene copolymer, an<br>
acrylonitrile/butadiene copolymer, a vinyl<br>
chloride/vinyl acetate copolymer, etc.<br>
Examples of polyethylene resin that can be<br>
advantageously employed in the present invention are<br>
low-, medium-, and high-density polyethylene, an<br>
ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer, an<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymer, a blend of<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, a blend of<br>
polyethylene and an ethylene/vinyl acetate<br>
copolymer, and a blend of polyethylene and an<br><br>
ethylene/propylene copolymer. Ethylene-butyl<br>
acrylate copolymer and ethylene-methyl methacrylate<br>
copolymer can also be used.<br>
The amount of polyolefin in the interpolymer<br>
resin particles of the invention ranges from about<br>
20% to about 80%, preferably 20% to 55%, by weight<br>
based on the weight of the interpolymer resin<br>
particles.<br>
The amount of polymerized vinyl aromatic resin<br>
in the interpolymer resin particles of the invention<br>
ranges from about 20% to about 80%, preferably from<br>
about 45% to about 80%, by weight based on the<br>
weight of the interpolymer resin particles.<br>
The vinyl aromatic resin can be polymerized<br>
monomers or the resin can be vinyl aromatic<br>
copolymers. Examples of vinyl aromatic monomers are<br>
styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, ethylstyrene,<br>
chlorostyrene, bromostyrene, vinyltoluene,<br>
vinylbenzene, and isopropylxylene. These monomers<br>
may be used either alone or in admixture.<br>
The vinyl aromatic copolymers can be similar to<br>
those disclosed in U.S Patent No. 4,049,594 (Ideka)<br>
assigned to Sekisui Kaseihin Kogyo Kabushiki Kaisha.<br>
These copolymers are styrene copolymers prepared by<br>
the copolymerization of a styrene monomer with<br>
monomers such as 1,3-butadiene, alkyl acrylates (for<br>
example, butyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate and 2-<br>
ethylhexyl acrylate), alkyl methacrylates (for<br>
example, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate,<br>
butyl methacrylate and 2-ethylhexyl methacrylate)<br>
acrylonitrile, vinyl acetate, alpha-methylethylene,<br><br>
divinyl benzene, dimethyl maleate and diethyl<br>
maleate.<br>
Preferably, the vinyl aromatic resin is<br>
polystyrene or styrene-butyl acrylate copolymers.<br>
In general, the interpolymer resin particles<br>
are formed as follows: The polyolefin particles are<br>
dispersed in an aqueous medium prepared by adding<br>
0.01 to 5%, preferably 2 to 3%, by weight based on<br>
the weight of the water of a suspending agent such<br>
as water soluble high molecular weight materials,<br>
e.g., polyvinyl alcohol or methyl cellulose or<br>
slightly water soluble inorganic materials, e.g.,<br>
calcium phosphate or magnesium pyrophosphate and<br>
soap, such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, and<br>
the vinyl aromatic monomers are added to the<br>
suspension and polymerized inside the polyolefin<br>
particles.<br>
Basically any of the conventionally known and<br>
commonly used suspending agents for polymerization<br>
of the vinyl aromatic monomers can be employed.<br>
These agents are well known in the art and can be<br>
freely selected by one skilled in the art.<br>
Initially, the water is in an amount generally from<br>
0.7 to 5, preferably 3 to 5 times that of the<br>
starting polyolefin particles employed in the<br>
aqueous suspension, on a weight basis, and gradually<br>
the ratio of the polymer particles to the water may<br>
reach around 1:1.<br>
The polymerization of the vinyl aromatic<br>
monomers, which is absorbed in the polyolefin<br>
particles, is carried out using initiators.<br><br>
The initiators suitable for suspension<br>
polymerization of the vinyl aromatic monomers are<br>
generally used in an amount of about 0.05 to 2<br>
percent, by weight, preferably 0.1 to 1 percent by<br>
weight, based on the weight of the vinyl aromatic<br>
monomer. Examples of suitable initiators include<br>
organic peroxides such as benzoyl peroxide, lauroyl<br>
peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate and t-butyl<br>
perpivalate and azo compounds such as<br>
azobisisobutylonitrile and azobis-<br>
dimethylvaleronitrile.<br>
These initiators can be used alone or two or<br>
more initiators can be used in combination. It is<br>
preferred that the initiators be dissolved in the<br>
vinyl aromatic monomers, which are to be absorbed in<br>
the polyolefin particles. This differs from that of<br>
the aforesaid U.S. Patent Nos. 3,959,189 and<br>
4,168,353, which dissolve the initiator in a<br>
solvent, e.g. toluene, benzene, and 1,2-<br>
dichloropropane. The invention sets out to<br>
eliminate the use of these solvents.<br>
When the in situ polymerization of the vinyl<br>
aromatic monomers is completed, the polymerized<br>
vinyl aromatic resin is uniformly dispersed inside<br>
the polyolefin particles.<br>
It is preferred to cross-link the polyolefin<br>
particles. Preferably, this cross-linking is done<br>
simultaneously with the polymerization of the vinyl<br>
aromatic monomer in the polyolefin particles, and<br>
before impregnation of the blowing agent and the<br>
limonene. For this purpose, cross-linking agents are<br>
used. Such cross-linking agents include di-t-butyl-<br><br>
peroxide, t-butyl-cumylperoxide, dicumyl-peroxide,<br>
a, a-bis-(t-butylperoxy)-p-diisopropylbenzene, 2,5-<br>
dimethyl-2,5-di-(t-butylperoxy)-hexyne-3,2,5-<br>
dimethyl-2,5-di-(benzoylperoxy)-hexane and t-butyl-<br>
peroxyisopropyl-carbonate. These cross-linking<br>
agents are absorbed in the polyolefin particles<br>
together with the vinyl aromatic monomers by<br>
dissolving the cross-linking agent in an amount of<br>
about 0.1 to 2 weight%, preferably 0.5 to 1 weight<br>
%, based on the weight of the polyolefin particles<br>
suspended in water. Further details of the cross-<br>
linking agents and the manner for absorbing the<br>
cross-linking agents into the polyolefin particles<br>
are given in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,959,189.<br>
The resulting interpolymer can be used as raw<br>
materials in producing foamed articles. The blowing<br>
agent and the limonene are introduced into the<br>
interpolymer resin particles to form foamable or<br>
expandable interpolymer particles, which in turn,<br>
are used to mold foamed articles.<br>
The blowing agent should have a boiling point<br>
lower than the softening point of the polyolefin and<br>
should be gaseous or liquid at room temperature<br>
(about 20 to 30°C) and normal pressure (about<br>
atmospheric). Blowing agents are well known in the<br>
art and generally have boiling points ranging from -<br>
42°C to 80°C, more generally, from -10°C to 36°C.<br>
Suitable hydrocarbon blowing agents include<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons such as n-propane, n-butane,<br>
iso-butane, n-pentane, iso-pentane, n-hexane, and<br>
neopentane, cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons such as<br><br>
cyclobutane and cyclopentane, and halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as methyl chloride, ethyl<br>
chloride, methylene chloride,<br>
trichlcrofluoromethane, dischlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorodifluormethane, chlorodifluoromethane and<br>
dichloroetetrafluoroethane, etc. These blowing<br>
agents can be used alone or as mixtures. If n-<br>
butane, ethyl chloride, and<br>
dichlorotetrafluoroethane, which are gaseous at room<br>
temperature and normal pressure, are used as a<br>
mixture, it is possible to achieve foaming to a low<br>
bulk density. The specific types of volatile blowing<br>
agents are taught in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No.<br>
3,959,180. Generally, the blowing agent is selected<br>
from the group consisting of n-pentane, iso-pentane,<br>
neopentane, cylcopentane, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The amount of the blowing agent ranges from<br>
about 1.5% to about 20% by weight, preferably about<br>
1.5% to 15 % by weight, more preferably from 5% to<br>
15% by weight, based on the weight of the<br>
interpolymer particles.<br>
Limonene is used in combination with the<br>
blowing agent and as stated herein above, acts as a<br>
plasticizer or blowing aid in the invention.<br>
Limonene is a mono-terpene hydrocarbon existing<br>
widely in the plant world. The known types are d-<br>
limonene, 1-limonene, and dl-limonene. D-limonene<br>
is contained in the skin of citrus fruits and is<br>
used in food additives as a fragrant agent; its<br>
boiling point is about 176°C; and its flammability<br>
is low. D-limonene is a colorless liquid, has a<br>
pleasant; orange-like aroma, is approved as a food<br><br>
containing the polyolefin particles, which are<br>
dispersed in the aqueous medium. These materials<br>
may be added all at one time, or gradually in<br>
individual portions.<br>
The interpolymer particles are acidified,<br>
dewatered, screened, and subsequently charged to a<br>
second reactor where the particles are impregnated<br>
with the blowing agent and the limonene.<br>
The impregnation step is carried out by<br>
suspending the interpolymer particles in an aqueous<br>
medium, adding the blowing agent and limonene to the<br>
resulting suspension, and stirring at a temperature<br>
of, preferably, about 40°C degrees to 80°C. The<br>
blowing agent and the limonene can be blended<br>
together and then added to the interpolymer<br>
particles or can be added to the interpolymer<br>
particles separately.<br>
Alternatively, the blowing agent and the<br>
limonene can be added to the first reactor during or<br>
after the polymerization process.<br>
The above processes describe a wet process for<br>
impregnation of the interpolymer particles.<br>
Alternatively, the interpolymer particles can be<br>
impregnated via an anhydrous process similar to that<br>
taught in Column 4, lines 20-36 of the aforesaid<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,429,059, which teachings in their<br>
entirety are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The interpolymer resin particles may also<br>
contain an anti-static additive; a flame retardant;<br>
a colorant or dye; and a filler material; other<br>
additives such as chain transfer agents, suitable<br>
examples including C2-15 alkyl mercaptans, such as n-<br><br>
additive, and is widely used as a raw material of<br>
perfume;. As stated hereinabove, limonene is not a<br>
hazardous air pollutant.<br>
Limonene is used in the invention to replace<br>
benzene, toluene, etc., as blowing aids disclosed in<br>
the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 4,429,059. The amount<br>
of limonene ranges from about 0.1 to 5 parts,<br>
preferably 0.1 to about 1 part, by weight per 100<br>
parts by weight of the foamable interpolymer resin<br>
particles.<br>
The interpolymer particles of the invention may<br>
be conveniently produced as follows: In a first<br>
reactor, the polyolefin particles are suspended in<br>
an aqueous medium containing a dispersing agent.<br>
The dispersing agent may be polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
methylcellulose, calcium phosphate, magnesium<br>
pyrophosphate, calcium carbonate, tricalcium<br>
phosphaite, etc. The amount of dispersing agent<br>
employed is 0.01 to 5% by weight based on the amount<br>
of water. A surfactant may be added to the aqueous<br>
medium. Generally, the surfactant is used to lower<br>
the surface tension of the suspension and helps to<br>
emulsify the water/vinyl aromatic monomer in mixture<br>
in the initiator and wax mixes, if used. A suitable<br>
wax would be ethylene bistearamide. The aqueous<br>
medium is generally heated to a temperature at which<br>
the vinyl aromatic monomers can be polymerized, i.e.<br>
from about 60°C to about 120°C over a period of time,<br>
for example, 12 to 2 0 hours. Over this 12 to 2 0<br>
hour period, the vinyl aromatic monomers, the vinyl<br>
aromatic polymerization initiator, and the cross-<br>
linking agent are added to the resulting suspension<br><br>
dodecyl mercaptan, t-dodecyl mercaptan, t-butyl<br>
mercaptan and n-butyl mercaptan, and other agents<br>
such as pentaphenyl ethane and the dimer of α-methyl<br>
styrene; and nucleating agents, such as polyolefin<br>
waxes, i.e. polyethylene waxes.<br>
The following example is intended to assist in<br>
understanding the present invention, however, in no<br>
way, should these examples be interpreted as<br>
limiting the scope thereof.<br>
Example<br>
85 pounds of interpolymer particles comprised<br>
of 30% by weight polyethylene and 70% by weight of<br>
an in situ polymerized styrene-butyl acrylate<br>
copolymer inside the polyethylene particles were<br>
charged into a 25-gallon reactor for impregnation.<br>
This reactor contained 93 pounds of deionized water,<br>
and 5 grams of Calsoft F90 (sodium dodecyl benzene<br>
sulfonate), a surfactant. The interpolymer<br>
particles were produced according to the process<br>
taught in the aforesaid U.S. Patent No. 3,959,189.<br>
0.35% by weight d-limonene, which is Technical Grade<br>
(95% purity) from Florida Chemical Company, and 13%<br>
by weight isopentane were added separately to the<br>
reactor. The contents of the reactor were stirred at<br>
200 rpm and heated to 50°C for about 4 hours.<br>
The expandability of the resultant foamed<br>
particles was measured by the minimum bulk density,<br>
which is achieved as the particles are processed in<br>
a single pass through a TRI 502 continuous steam<br>
expander. The resulting particles had a more<br>
pleasant smell, i.e. an orange blossom fragrance,<br><br>
compared to the interpolymer particles of the prior<br>
art.<br>
The foamed particles produced in the Example<br>
were dried out and then molded into 24 inch x 24<br>
inch x 2 inch rectangular samples. The machine was<br>
a Kohler General KG 606 steam molding press. The<br>
physical properties were measured and/or tested<br>
according to the standards set up by ASTM D3 57 5.<br>
These properties appear in the Table below. In the<br>
Table, the interpolymer particles of the invention<br>
containing d-limonene are compared to the<br>
interpolymer particle of the prior art, where<br>
ethylbenzene was used as the blowing aid.<br>
TABLE<br>
Expandability Summary<br><br><br>
As can be seen from the Table, the interpolymer<br>
particles of the invention can use a lower amount of<br>
blowing aid, i.e. 0.35 pph (invention) vs. 0.50 pph<br>
(for the particles using ethylbenzene as the blowing<br>
aid), and can obtain a lower minimum achievable<br>
density compared to the particles of the prior art;<br>
that is, 1.15 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) for the<br>
interpolymer particles of the invention vs. 1.20<br>
pounds per cubic foot (pcf) for the particles of the<br>
prior art using ethylbenzene. Also, the values for<br>
the properties of the interpolymer particles of the<br>
invention using d-limonene show an improvement<br>
compared to those for conventional interpolymer<br>
particles using ethylbenzene as the blowing aid.<br>
While the present invention has been<br>
particularly set forth in terms of specific<br>
embodiments thereof, it will be understood that<br>
numerous variations for the invention are now<br>
enabled and reside within the scope of the<br>
invention. Accordingly, the invention is to be<br>
broadly construed and limited only by the scope and<br>
spirit of the claims now appended hereto. Also,<br>
even though, the terms "vinyl aromatic monomer" and<br>
"vinyl aromatic monomers" were used with reference<br>
to the interpolymer resin particles of the invention<br>
and the process for producing these particles of the<br>
invention, it is to be understood that these terms<br>
can be interchangeable with "vinyl aromatic<br>
copolymer" and "vinyl aromatic copolymers",<br>
respectively.<br><br>
