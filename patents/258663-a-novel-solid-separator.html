				<td>The present invention relates to a solid separator useful for separating solid particles from any flexible substrate such as skins and hides. The present invention particularly relates to a solid separator for separating salt from wet or dry salted skins and hides. The present invention more particularly relates to mechanical desalting of wet or dry salted skins and hides prior to processing. This device has enormous potential application in leather industry as a mechanical remover of salts from the surface of raw hides/ skins.<br>
Desalting of salt preserved raw hides/skins is a vital operation prior to first soak in a leather processing tannery. Manual desalting is done by using wooden frame, as shown in figure-1 of the drawings accompanying this specification. Figure-1 depicts the pictorial view of the wooden frame. Hides / skin are held at its edges by two persons and is beaten twice or thrice on the frame. The operation helps to remove salt from the salted substrates. The main limitation associated with this manual separation is that it is highly tiresome and time consuming. Another important limitation associated with this manual system is that the salts separated get dispersed throughout the floor and it has to be collected. Moreover, the manual beating deteriorates the quality of the leather.<br>
The above limitations have prompted the tanners to explore better options for salt separation by using a brush type-desalting machine. In the drawings accompanying this specification figure-2 represents the parts and assembly drawing of the existing brushing machine, available for desalting skins. Different parts of figure-2 are the following:<br>
2.	refers to the brush roller<br>
3.	refers to the frame assembly<br>
4.	refers to the bearing assembly<br>
5.	refers to the to the power transmission<br><br>
This machine, as shown in figure-2 of the drawings accompanying this specification, consists of a brush roller (2) supported by bearings (4) to rotate smoothly by a power transmission sources (5) thereby causing rotary motion of the brush roller as per the required rotation per minute and the entire system is placed on a frame assembly (3). The machine has its own limitations. The raw material has to be fed one by one, adversely affecting the productivity. Moreover, the salts removed get dispersed and require to be collected manually, consuming lot of time. The distance between the brush rollers has to be adjusted according to the to the thickness of the raw substrates. The workers might face accident if they don't feed the raw material properly, resulting in damage of their hands.<br>
As reported by Parthasarathi and Chandrababu (Lecture notes, Refresher Training Programme for the personnel from KVIC &amp; KVIB, CLRI, pp. 44 - 44A, 1998), an improved desalting drum has been developed by making perforated holes the periphery of the cylindrical wooden tanning drum. In the drawings accompanying this specification figure-3 represents the parts and assembly drawing of the existing desalting drum, available for dieseling of hides / skins. Different parts of figure-3 are the following:<br>
6.	refers to the wooden drum<br>
7.	refers to the perforation at the periphery of the wooden drum<br>
8.	refers to the driving mechanism<br>
9.	refers to the journal bearing<br>
10.	refers to the frame assembly<br>
This machine, as shown in figure-3, comprises of a wooden drum (6) having perforations (7) at the periphery of the drum (6) supported by bearings (9) to rotate smoothly by a power transmission sources (8) thereby causing rotary motion of the drum as per the required rotation per<br><br>
minute and the entire system is placed on a frame assembly (10). Much better effect resulted in more effective separation of salt from the hides /skins due to the mechanical action under dynamic condition. Rotational movement of the drum ensures that the skin / hides are first lifted up by the shelves and then allowed to fall down under gravity into the drum and the separated salt comes out from the drum through the perforated holes and fall on to the ground. Although this remover ensures that the fatigue of the workers is reduced to a great extent, thereby improving the production rate, yet the major limitations associated herewith are as follows. The salts, removed by the process, have a tendency to stick on to the raw materials and the drum again. Thus the removal of salt by this drum is not effective. This requires a proper system for collection of the substrate as well as the solid to be separated as soon as the separation is over. Moreover, as the drum gets loaded, the torque required to rotate the drum is much higher than the normal running torque. The self-weight of the drum is also high as it is made of wood. A similar situation appears in case of removing any solid substance, adhered to the surface of any other flexible substrate.<br>
In our co-pending Indian Patent application no. 2421DEL2004, an attempt has been made to remove the adhered salts in the salt cured hides/skins before subjecting the same for processing. The cured hides and skins are treated with not less than 500% w/v, of saturated sodium chloride solution for not less than 10 minutes, preferably with intermittent shaking. Saturated solution of sodium chloride contains 35.7% of sodium chloride at 0°C and 39.1% of sodium chloride at 100°C. Solubility of sodium chloride remains in the above range at a temperature in the range of 0°C - 100°C. Saturated sodium chloride solution does not take up the salt coming out of cured hides and skins and therefore slowly trickles down and settles at the bottom of the tank. The salt that has settled to the bottom of the tank is recovered through known separation<br><br>
methods. The recovered salt is washed with multiple changes of not less than 100% w/v of fresh saturated sodium chloride solution to remove the organic and other suspended impurities. The recovered wet salt is then dried by known methods to remove the moisture. The saturated sodium chloride medium, which becomes contaminated during washing operation of cured hides and skins is regenerated by treating with not less than 0.5% w/w, of deodorizing / decolourising compounds along with not less than 0.1% w/w, of alkali metal salt, selected from carbonate, bicarbonates or hydroxide for a period of not less than half an hour followed by separation by known method for further use.<br>
No prior art is available on any device providing facility for simultaneous separation and collection of the solids to be separated out and also the flexible substrate to be subjected to separation.<br>
The main objective of the present inventions is to provide a solid separator useful for separating solid particles from any flexible substrate such as skins and hides, which obviates the limitations as stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a device exhibiting provision for automatic unloading of the salt removed stock.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a single perforated vessel system exhibiting eccentric rotary motion to facilitates vibration effect for better mechanical agitation.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a solid remover that ensures that the salts are collected properly thereby reducing the wastages.<br><br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide a device that ensure that the loaded stock with salt has to travel from front side of the vessel to the rear side of the vessel automatically for unloading the purified stock and simultaneously collecting the salt separately.<br>
The solid separator of the present invention useful for separating solid particles from any flexible substrate such as skins and hides, consists of a perforated, cylindrical hollow light weight container with baffles fixed in the inner periphery through out the length of the container. The container has different diameter of friction rings fixed along its exterior periphery to form a trapezoid which makes an inclination, which helps the substrates to move from front side to rear side of the container while the container rotates by producing vibrating mechanical action with the support of eccentric friction rollers having different diameters. The substrate is fed through an external loading chute fixed at the front end of the container. As the container rotates, the hide / skin is lifted up along with the baffles and falls inside the container repeatedly. The solid to be separated is collected in a collector fixed underneath the container.<br>
