				<td>The    present    invention    relates    to    a    benzimidazole    compounds    and antihistaminic compositions containing the same.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to new benzimidazole derivatives with H1 antihistaminic activity, lacking cardiotoxic effects.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The prior art closest to the compounds of the present invention is in Spanish patent No. 9201512 which describes a number of piperidine benzimidazole derivatives with antihistarninic and antiallergic activity of general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
The major structural difference between the compounds of the present invention and those of the said patent is the presence of oxygenated functions in the phenyl group substitution. An important pharmacophorous character has moreover been found for these oxygenated functions which consists essentially in a selectivity of action and provides a pharmacological profile distinct from that of other known antihistirnaines. The compounds disclosed in this invention present an almost exclusive H1 antihistaminic pharmacological activity and are therefore devoid of action on other<br><br>
pharmacological receptors even at doses much higher than the<br>
therapeutic ones. Because of this selectivity in action, they are valuable<br>
instruments in treating allergic-type conditions, particularly allowing<br>
their unrestricted use by persons under any other concomitant medication<br>
whatsoever, and in the case of patients with pathological<br>
cardiocirculatory disturbances.<br>
Description of Che Invention<br>
It has long since been known that histamine plays a very important role<br>
in allergic-type diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria<br>
and asthma; antihistaminic compounds acting at the H^-receptor<br>
histamine level are useful for treating such conditions.<br>
First generation Ht antihistamines presented a number of adverse effects,<br>
such as sedation and dryness of the mouth, resulting from its action on<br>
the central nervous system and colinergic receptors.<br>
The search for molecules that would not cross the haematoencephalic<br>
barrier brought about the displacement of the early antihistamines by<br>
other second generation antihistamines which overcame the side effects<br>
linked to their action on the central nervous system. This new generation<br>
of antihistamines, amongst which noteworthy, due to their extensive use<br>
worldwide, are terfenadine and astemizole, has recently displayed a<br>
negative aspect in the form of dangerous cardiovascular effects,<br>
extending the QT space and ventricular arrhythmia, •which has required<br>
its use to be avoided in those cases in which the patient is prone to<br>
suffering such disturbances or when he is being treated with substances<br>
that may interfere with his metabolism.<br>
Attempts at obtaining safe and efficient Ht antihistamines have<br>
multiplied in recent years and this research has resulted in several recent<br>
patent applications claiming pharmaceutical compositions for treating<br>
allergic diseases containing antihistamines devoid of arrhythmogenic<br>
effects, which is the case of US patent application number 924,156<br>
(3/08/92) and international patent application number 95/00480<br>
(05/01/95).<br>
The present invention relates to a group of new compounds with<br>
benzimidazolic structure having potent selective H, antihistaminic<br>
activity, lacking activity on the central nervous system and on the<br>
cardiovascular system.<br>
The compounds subject of the present invention have the following<br>
general formula:<br>
Me<br>
in which Rj is hydrogen or a short chain hydrocarbon group such as<br>
methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, cyclopropyl or vinyl, and R2 is a group<br>
selected from among CHZOH, COOH, COOR, and 4,4-dimethyl-2-<br>
oxazolinyl, R3 being a short chain alkyl group as previously defined,<br>
and their addition salts with pharmacologically acceptable acids or<br>
bases.<br>
Compounds I in which Rj is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is the<br>
4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolin3rl group can be conveniently prepared by an<br>
N-alkylation reaction of 2-(4-piperidinyl)-lH-benzimidazole with an<br>
alkylating agent of formula III wherein X is a good leaving group in<br>
nucleophilic substitution reactions such as Cl, Br, I, R4SO2, R2SOj,<br>
etc., in the presence of an inorganic base, such as an alkaline metal<br>
carbonate or bicarbonate within an organic solvent, followed by<br>
another N-alkylation reaction of the resulting benzimidazole IV with<br>
an ether of formula XCH2CH2OR,, wherein X has the meaning given<br>
above and R! is a short chain hydrocarbon group, such as Me, Et, i-Pr,<br>
cyclopropyl, vinyl, etc., in the presence of a hydride or an alkaline<br>
metal carbonate.<br>
Compounds I, in which R! is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a<br>
carboxyl group, can be conveniently prepared by hydrolysis of the<br>
benzimidazoles la with a mineral acid such as HC1 or H2SO4.<br>
Compounds I in which R! is a short chain alkyl group and Rz is a<br>
COORj group in which R, is a short chain alkyl group, can be prepared<br>
by acid hydrolysis of the benzimidazoles la in the presence of an alcohol<br>
solvent RjOH, in adequate conditions for transesterification.<br>
Compounds I in which R! is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a<br>
Ct^OH group can be prepared by a reduction of the benzimidazoles Ib<br>
or Ic with a suitable reducing agent, such as aluminium and lithium<br>
hydride.<br>
Compound I in which Rt is a hydrogen and R2 is a 4,4-dimethyl-2-<br>
oxazolinyl group can be prepared by an alkylation of the benzimidazole<br>
IV with ethyl chloroacetate in the presence of a hydride or an alkaline<br>
metal carbonate to yield the ester V, which is then reduced by a reducing<br>
agent such as aluminium and lithium hydride.<br>
Compound I in which R, is a hj'drogen and R2 is a COOH group is<br>
conveniently prepared by hydrolysis with a mineral acid such as HC1 or<br>
H2SO4 of the compound le.<br>
The obtained new benzimidazoles I can be turned into pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts by treatment with suitable acids or bases.<br>
Compounds of formula I have useful pharmacological properties. In<br>
particular, they are potent H, antihistamines. This activity was clearly<br>
demonstrated in vitro by blocking the histamine-induced contractions in<br>
the isolated guinea pig ileum (Magnus, Pflilgers, Arch. Ges. Physiol.,<br>
102, 123 (1904); Arunlakshana, O. and Schild, H.O., Br. J. Pharmacol.<br>
14,48-58 (1959)) and in vivo by the capacity to inhibit the increment of<br>
histamine-induced cutaneous capillary permeability in rats (Lefebvre, P.,<br>
Salmon, J., Leconte and Cauwenberge, V.H., C.R. Soc. Biol. 156, 183-<br>
186 (1962); Udaka, K., Takeuchi, Y. and Morat, H.Z., Proc. Soc. Exp.<br>
Biol.Med. 133, 1384-1387(1970)).<br>
Thus, compound Ib (R1=ethyl) proved to be a potent guinea pig ileum<br>
Hreceptor histamine mixed antagonist, with calculated pA2=7.98-8.10<br>
and pD2'=6.50. This same compound inhibited in vivo the increase in<br>
capillary permeability in rats with a DESO close to 2 mg/kg p.o. At doses<br>
of 5 mg/kg p.o. it maintained a significant activity, in excess of 50%, for<br>
at least 6 hours.<br>
These compounds are highly selective in their pharmacological action,<br>
and present no significant anticholinergic activity nor activity on the<br>
central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Thus, compound Ib (Rt=Et)<br>
is not able to antagonize significantly the acetylcholine-induced<br>
contractions in isolated guinea pig ileum at 0.1 M concentrations and<br>
does not modify the spontaneous motor activity of the rat at 100 mg/kg<br>
p.o.; furthermore, this same compound, administered at 20 mg/kg i.v.,<br>
induces no morphological ECG disturbance nor does it increase the QTC<br>
interval in rats.<br>
In view of their useful pharmacological antihistaminic and antiallergic<br>
properties, the compounds described in the present invention can be<br>
formulated in several pharmaceutical forms to be later administered<br>
orally, topically, injectably and rectally. Oral preparations are made by<br>
intimately mixing a quantity effective as antihistaminic of one of the<br>
products described in the present invention with excipients such as<br>
lactose, cellulose, talc and the like for tablets or capsules, or water,<br>
glycols, alcohols, oils and the like for syrups, solutions and suspensions.<br>
Topical administration can be made in the form of creams, ointments,<br>
gels, solutions and transcutaneous plasters, using agents such as<br>
vaseline, polyethylene glycols. etc. as a carrier. In preparations for<br>
injectables, the excipient will be, at least for the most part, sterilised<br>
water, although other excipients, such as saline solutions, glucose<br>
solutions, etc., or mixtures thereof, may be added to enhance solubility.<br>
The examples detailed below illustrate the present invention without<br>
howsoever limiting its scope.<br>
