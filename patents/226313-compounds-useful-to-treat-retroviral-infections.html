COMPOUNDS USEFUL TO TREAT RETROVIRAL INFECTIONS FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds useful for inhibiting a retrovirus in a human cell infected with said retrovirus. More particularly, the present invention provides pyran-2-ones, 5,6-dihydropyran-2-ones, 4-hydroxy-benzopyran-2-ones, 4-hydroxy-cycloalkyl[b]pyran-2-ones, and derivatives thereof as HIV-proteinase inhibitors,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
During the past decade, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has progressed from having the status of a medical curiosity afOicting only a small number of individuals to a problem of msyor proportions, both medically and economically. John Saunders and Richard Storer, "New Developments in RT nhibitors," DN&amp;P 5(3), April 1992, pages 153-169. WHO figures reveal that more chan 360,000 cases of AIDS have been reported worldwide, including nearly 175,000 cases in the U.S.A. Of these, approximately 100,000 worldwide (50,000 in the U.S.A.) were reported in the preceding 12-month period. In the U.S.A., the number of seropositive individuals is thought to be approximately two million, and estimates suggest that 5-10 million people worldwide may be seropositive. Saunders and Storer, page 153.<br>
Since the first description of the malady in the early part of this decade, acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS) and its devastating conse¬quences have been subjects of continuous and intense coverage in both the lay and scientific press. Indeed, an edition of Scientific American was entirely devoted to AIDS (Scientific American 289, #4 (1988)), and the literature on the disease and the virus is already so vast as to defy thorough citation.<br>
On March 20, 1987, the FDA approved the use of the compound, zidovudine (AZT), to treat AIDS patients with a recent initial episode of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, AIDS patients with conditions other than Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or patients infected with the virus with an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count of less than 200/mm  in the peripheral blood. AZT is a known inhibitor of viral reverse transcriptase, an enzyme necessaR7 for human immunodeficiency virus replication. U.S. Patent 4,724,232 claims a method of treating humans having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome utilizing 3'-azido-3'-deoxy-thymidine (azidothymidine, AZT).<br>
Following the discoveR7 of the anti-HIV activity of AZT, much effort has been focused on a wide variety of other dideoxynucleoside analogues in the search for<br><br>
superior agents. In the case of the 2'.3'-dideoxy series, ddC and ddl have shown potent activity against HIV in vitro and have been evaluated in clinical trials. Saunders and Storer, page 160. The compound ddC is currently being developed by Hoffman-La Roche Co. as a potential anti-AIDS drug. Its limiting toxicity in humans is peripheral neuropathy which is reversible at low doses. Raymond R. Schinazi, Jan R. Mead and Paul M. Feorino, "Insights Into HIV Chemotherapy," AIDS Research and Human Retroviruses, Vol. 8, Number 6, 1992, pages 963-990. It has been approved by the FDA for AIDS therapy in combination with AZT. The compound ddl has also been evaluated in clinical trials. Its limiting toxicities are peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis. It has also been shown to stimulate hepatic glycolysis leading to irreversible liver damage. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 966. It has recently been approved by the FDA for the treatment of HIV-1 infections 1 adults and pediatric patients who are intolerant to or whose health has ignificantly deteriorated while on AZT treatment. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, •age 966.<br>
Among these approved drugs, AZT is currently the only drug that has been shown to decrease the mortality and frequency of opportunistic infections associated tvith AIDS. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 963.<br>
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has long been recognized as the causative agent in AIDS, although a minority opinion to the contraR7 has been expressed (e.g., P. DuesbeR8, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci., USA, 86:755-764 (1989)). Sequence analysis of the complete genomes from several infective and non-infective HIV-isolates has shed considerable light on the make-up of the virus and the types of molecules that are essential for its replication and maturation to an infective species. The HIV protease is essential for the processing of the viral gag and gag-pol polypeptides into mature virion proteins. L. Ratner, et al.. Nature, 313:277-284 (1985); L.H. Pearl and W.R. Taylor, Nature, 329:351 (1987). HIV exhibits the same gag/pol/env oR8anization seen in other retroviruses. L. Ratner, et al., above; S. Wain-Hobson, et al.. Cell, 40:9-17 (1985); R. Sanchez-Pescador, et al., Science, 227:484-492 (1985); and M.A. Muesing, et al., Nature, 313: 450-458 (1985).<br>
Reverse transcriptase (RT) is an enzyme unique to retroviruses that catalyzes the conversion of viral RNA into double stranded DNA. Blockage at any point during the transcription process, by AZT or any other aberrant deoxynucleoside triphosphate incapable of elongation, should have dramatic consequences relative to viral replication. Much work on the RT taR8et is in progress based, in laR8e measure, upon the fact that nucleosides like AZT are easily delivered to cells.<br><br>
However, the inefficiency of phosphoR7lation steps to the triphosphate, and the lack of specificity and consequent toxicity, constitute major drawbacks to use of AZT and similar nucleosides having a blocked, or missing, Sliydroxyl group.<br>
The T4 cell receptor for HIV, the so-called CD4 molecule, has also been taR8eted as an intervention point in AIDS therapy. R.A. Fisher, et al.. Nature, 331:76-78 (1988); R.E. Hussey, et al., Nature, 331:78-81 (1988); and KC. Deen, et al., Nature, 331:82-84 (1988). The exterior portion of this transmembrane protein, a molecule of 371 amino acids (sCD4) has been expressed in Chinese hamster ovaR7 (CHO) cells and Genentech (D.H. Smith, et al.. Science, 238:1704-1707 (1987)) has had a product in clinical trials since the fall of 1987. CD4 has been shown to have a larrow spectrum of activity against wild-type virus and so far has failed to control rllV infection in humans. Schinazi, Mead and Feorino, page 963. The idea behind 3D4 based therapy is that the molecules can neutralize HIV by interfering with viral attachment to T4, and other cells which express CD4 on their surfaces. A variant on this theme is to attach cell toxins to CD4 for specific binding and deUveR7 to infected cells which display glycoprotein gp-120 on their surfaces. MA. Till, et al., Science, 242:1166-1168 (1988); and V.K ChaudhaR7, et al., Nature, 335:369-372 (1988).<br>
Another therapeutic taR8et in AIDS involves inhibition of the viral protease (or proteinase) that is essential for processing HlV-fusion polypeptide precursors. In HIV and several other retroviruses, the proteolytic maturation of the gag and gag/pol fusion polypeptides (a process indispensable for generation of infective viral particles) has been shown to be mediated by a protease that is, itself, encoded by the pol region of the viral genome. Y. Yoshinaka, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:1618-1622 (1985); Y. Yoshinaka, et al., J. Virol., 55:870-873 (1985); Y. Yoshinaka, et al., J. Virol., 57:826-832 (1986); and K. von der Helm, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 74:911-915 (1977). Inhibition of the protease has been shown to inhibit the processing of the HIV p55 in mammalian cell and HIV replication in T lymphocytes. T.J. McQuade, et al., Science, 247:454 (1990).<br>
The protease (or proteinase), consisting of only 99 amino acids, is among the smallest enzymes known, and its demonstrated homology to aspartyl proteases such as pepsin and renin (L.H. Pearl and W.R. Taylor, Nature, 329: 351-354 (1987); and I. Katoh, et al.. Nature, 329:654-656 (1987)), led to inferences regarding the three-dimensional structure and mechanism of the enzyme (L.H. Pearl and W.R. Taylor, above) that have since been borne out experimentally. Active HIV protease has been expressed in bacteria (see, e.g., P.L. Darke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:2307-2312<br><br>
(1989)) and chemically synthesized (J. Schneider and S.B. Kent, Cell, 54:363-368 (1988); and R.F. Nutt, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:7129-7133 (1988)).  Site directed mutagenesis (P.L. Darke, et al., above); and N.E. Kohl, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:4686-4690 (1988)) and pepstatin inhibition (P.L. Darke, et al., J. Biol. Chem., 264:2307-2312 (1989); S. Seehneier, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., USA, 85:6612-6616 (1988); C.-Z. Giam and I. Borsos, J. Biol. Chem., 263:14617-14720 (1988); and J. Hansen, et al., EMBO J., 7:1785-1791 (1988)) have provided evidence for HIV protease's mechanistic function as an aspartyl protease. A study has demonstrated that the protease cleaves at the sites expected in peptides modeled after the regions actually cleaved by the enzyme in the gag and pol precursor proteins during viral maturation. P.L. Darke, et al,, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Communs., 156:297-303 (1988). X-ray cR7stallographic analysis of the HIV-protease (M.A. Navia, et al.. Nature, 337:615-620 (1989)) and a related retroviral enzyme from Rous sarcoma virus (M. Miller, et al., Nature, 337:576-579 (1989)) reveal an active site in the protease dimer that is identical to that seen in other aspartyl proteases, thus supporting the supposition (L.H. Pearl and W.R, Taylor, above) that the HIV enzyme is active as a dimer. See also Joseph A Martin, "Recent Advances in the Design of HIV Proteinase Inhibitors," Antiviral Research, 17 (1992) 265-278.<br>
To date, the scientific search for a fully effective and safe means of inhibiting retroviruses in a human hosting such a virus, and thereby effectively treating diseases caused by such a virus, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), continues.<br>

The compounds of the present invention are named according to the lUPAC or CAS nomenclature system.<br>
The carbon atoms content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties is indicated by a prefix designating the minimum and maximum number of carbon atoms in the moiety, i.e., the prefix Cj-Cj indicates a moiety of the integer "i" to the integer "j" carbon atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, C2-C3 alkyl refers to alkyl of one to three carbon atoms, inclusive, or methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl, straight and branched forms thereof<br>
Also, the carbon atom content of various hydrocarbon-containing moieties of the present invention is indicated by a subscripted integer representing the number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the moiety, e.g., "CjjH2n" indicates a moiety of the integer "n" carbon atoms, inclusive, and the integer "2n" hydrogen atoms, inclusive. Thus, for example, "CjjH2u" wherein n is one to three carbon atoms, inclusive, and two to six hydrogen atoms, inclusive, or methyl, ethyl, propyl and isopropyl, and all isomeric, straight and branched forms thereof.<br>
Examples of alkyl of one to nine carbon atoms, inclusive, are methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, and nonyl, and all isomeric forms thereof and straight and branched forms thereof.<br>
Examples of alkenyl of one to five carbon atoms, inclusive, are ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl, pentenyl, all isomeric forms thereof, and straight and branched forms thereof.<br>
By "halo" is meant the typical halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.<br>
The compounds of formula I and II of the present invention inhibit retroviral proteinases and thus inhibit the replication of the virus. They are useful for treating patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and related diseases.<br>
More particularly, the compounds of the present invention are useful as novel human retroviral protease inhibitors. Therefore, the compounds inhibit retroviral proteases and thus inhibit the replication of the virus. They are useful for treating human patients infected with a human retrovirus, such as human immunodeficiency virus (strains of HIV-1 or HIV-2) or human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV-I or HTLV-II) which results in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or<br><br>
related diseases.<br>
The capsid and replicative enzymes (i.e. protease, reverse transcriptase, integrase) of retroviruses are translated from the viral gag and pol genes as polyproteins that are further processed by the viral protease (PR) to the mature proteins found in the viral capsid and necessaR7 for viral fiinctions and replication. If the PR is absent or nonfunctional, the virus cannot replicate. The retroviral PR, such as HIV-1 PR, has been found to be an aspartic protease with active site characteristics similar to those exhibited by the more complex aspartic protease, renin.<br>
The term human retrovirus (HRV) includes human immunodeficiency virus type I, human immunodeficiency virus type II, or strains thereof, as well as human T cell leukemia virus 1 and 2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2) or strains apparent to one skilled in the art, which belong to the same or related viral families and which create similar physiological effects in humans as various human retroviruses.<br>
Patients to be treated would be those individuals:  1) infected with one or more strains of a human retrovirus as determined by the presence of either measurable viral antibody or antigen in the serum and 2) in the case of HIV, having either an asymptomatic HIV infection or a symptomatic AIDS defining infection such as i) disseminated histoplasmosis, ii) isopsoriasis, iii) bronchial and pulmonaR7 candidiasis including pneumocystic pneumonia iv) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or v) Kaposi's sarcoma and being less than sixty years old; or having an absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm  in the peripheral blood. Treatment would consist of maintaining an inhibitoR7 level of the compound used according to this in¬vention in the patient at all times and would continue until the occurrence of a second symptomatic AIDS defining infection indicates alternate therapy is needed.<br>
More specifically, an example of one such human retrovirus is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, also known as HTLV-III or LAV) which has been recognized as the causative agent in human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), P. DuesbeR8, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 86:755 (1989). HIV contains a retro viral encoded protease, HIV-I protease, that cleaves the fusion polypeptides into the functional proteins of the mature viral particle, E.P. Lillehoj, et al., J. Virology, 62:3053 (1988); C. Debuck, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., 84:8903 (1987). This enzyme, HIV-I protease, has been classified as an aspartyl protease and has a demonstrated homology to other aspartyl proteases such as renin, L.H. Pearl, et al.. Nature 329:351 (1987); I. Katoh, et al., Nature 329:654 (1987). Inhibition of HIV-I protease blocks the replication of HIV and thus is useful in the treatment of human<br><br>
AIDS, E.D. Clerq, J. Med. Chem. 29:1561 (1986). Inhibitors of HIV-I protease are useful in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals who are asymptomatic or symptomatic of AIDS.<br>
Pepstatin A, a general inhibitor of aspartyl proteases, has been disclosed as an inhibitor of HIV-I protease, S. Seelmeier, et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 85:6612 (1986). Other substrate derived inhibitors containing reduced bond isosteres or statine at the scissle position have also been disclosed, M.L. Moore, et al., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Commun. 159:420 (1989); S. Billich, et al., J. Biol. Chem. 263:17905 (1988); Sandoz, D.E. 3812-576-A.<br>
Thus, the compounds of the present invention are useful for treating diseases caused by retroviruses, such as human acquired immunodeficiency disease syndrome (AIDS).<br>
The compounds are also useful for treating non-human animals infected with a retrovirus, such as cats infected with feline leukemia virus. Other viruses that infect cats include, for example, feUne infectious peritonitis virus, calicivirus, rabies virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feUne parvovirus (panleukopenia virus), and feline chlamydia. Exact dosages, forms and modes of administration of the compounds of the present invention to non-human animals would be apparent to one of ordinaR7 skill in the art, such as a veterinarian.<br>
The compounds of formula I and II of the present invention are prepared as described in the Charts, Preparations and Examples below, or are prepared by methods analogous thereto, which are readily known and available to one of ordinaR7 skill in the art of oR8anic synthesis.<br>
CHART A<br>
Nitration of the cyclopropylphenyl ketone of formula A-1, which is commercially available, with fuming nitric acid at -40 °C produces a ca. 2:1 mixture of isomers. The desired m-nitro compound of formula A-2 is easily separated fi*om the crude mixture by recR7stallization from methanol. Catalytic hydrogenation of the cyclopropyl-(3-nitrophenyl)methanone of formula A-2 with 10% platinum on carbon in methanol gives the aniline of formula A-3. The aniUne is then coupled with benzenesulfonyl chloride using pyridine in methylene chloride to give the sulfonamide derivative of formula A-4. Reduction of the ketone with sodium borohydride in tetrahydrofuran and ethanol then produces the carbinol of formula A-5.<br>
The dianion of the cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-6, prepared as described in Chart B, is formed using lithium diisopropyl amide in tetrahydrofuran at 0 °C,<br><br>
and then alkylated with iodopropane to give the 10-propyl-cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-7. The cyclooctylpyranone of formula A-7 and the carbinol of the formula A-5 are then coupled using/)-toluenesulfonic acid in methylene chloride to give the sulfonamide derivative of formula A-8.<br>

The commercially available amine of the formula B-1 is protected using benzyl chloroformate and sodium bicarbonate in THF/water solution to give the compound of formula B-2. The aldehyde of formula B-2 is then reacted with a Grignard reagent to give the secondaR7 alcohol of formula B-3, wherein, e.g., Rj is isobutyl. The known cyclooctylpyranone of formula B-4 is prepared by acylation of the trimethylsilyl enol ether of cyclooctanone with malonyl dichloride as described in R. EfFenbeR8er, T. Ziegler, K-H. Schonwalder, T. Kesmarszky, B. Bauer Chem. Ber. 119:3394-3404 (1986). The alcohol of formula B-3 is then used to alkylate the cyclooctylp3Tanone of formula B-4 in refluxing toluene and p-toluenesulfonic acid to obtain the compound of the formula B-5, wherein, e.g., R4 is isobutyl. At this point, the enantiomers of formula B-5 are separated using a chiral HPLC column. The benzyloxy protecting group is then cleaved using 10% Pd/C in cyclohexene to give the amine of formula B-6, wherein, e.g., Rj is isobutyl, which is reacted with aR7l sulfonyl chlorides to give the compounds of the formula B-7, wherein, e.g., Rj is isobutyl and R2 is 1-methylimidazole.<br>

3-Bromobenzyl alcohol of formula C-1, which is commercially available, in tetrahydrofviran is treated with methyllithium, n-butyllithium and cyclpropanecarboxaldehyde in sequence at -78°C. The resulting solution is gradually warmed to room temperature and then heated at reflux affording the alcohol of formula C-2. The resulting alcohol, in dichloromethane, in the presence of molecular sieves, is treated with 4-hydroxy-5,6,7,8,9,10-hexahydrocycloocta[b]pyran-2-one of formula C-8, prepared as described in Chart B, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. The solution is heated at reflux to afford the alcohol of formula C-3. The benzyl alcohol I    is treated with carbon tetrabromide and triphenylphosphine in dichloromethane at 0°C to afford compounds of formula C-4 and C-5 as an inseparable mixture after an aqueous brine workup. The mixture is then treated with any thiol (e.g., thiophenol) and an oR8anic base and heated at reflux to afford sulfides of the formula C-6. Finally treatment of the compounds of the formula C-6 with oxone in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran, methanol and water gives sulfones of formula C-7.<br>

CHART ZZZ<br>
Polymeric meto-aminobenzaldehyde is protected by treating with benzyl bromide and potassium carbonate in acetonitrile at reflux to yield the compound of formula ZZZ-2. A vinyl anion is generated from 2-bromovinyltrimethylsilane of formula ZZZ-3 by treatment with t-butyl lithium at -78°C to -20°C. The vinyl anion so generated is cooled to -78°C and the diprotected meto-aminobenzaldehyde of formula ZZZ-2 is added to afford the desired allylic alcohol of formula ZZZ-3. The alcohol is easily converted to the acetate or carbonate of formula ZZZ-5 by standard means (e.g., CH3COCI, pyridine, CH2CI2, 0°C). These substrates participate in palladium catalyzed allylic substitutions as delineated in Charts AAAA-CCCC (C.G. Frost; J. Howarth; J.M.J. Williams, Tetrahedron: AsymmetR7 (1992) 3:1089-1122).<br>
CHART AAAA<br>
The sodium salt of methyl acetoacetate of formula AAAA-1 generated by treating methyl acetoacetate with sodium hydride at 0°C in either DMF or THF acts as the nucleophile in a palladium catalyzed allylic substitution. If this reaction is<br><br>
run in the presence of palladium allyl chloride dimer of formula AAAA-3 as the palladium source and a chiral phosphine ligand (P. von Matt; A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1993) 32:566-568), a kinetic resolution of the starting allyUc acetate or carbonate results in the synthesis of optically enriched allylated product of formula AAAA-4. If the reaction with nucleophile is slow, the acetate generated from formation of the pi-allyl palladium intermediate isomerizes the two possible diastereomeric pi-allyl complexes so that a stereoselective synthesis of the allylated product occurs (B.M. Trost; P.E.J. Strege, Am. Chem. Soc. (1977) 99:1649). Treat¬ment of the resulting vinyl silane of formula AAAA-4 with pam-toluenesulfonic acid in acetonitrile at reflux affords the desilylated olefin of formula AAAA-5. The dihydropyrone product of formula AAAA-7 is formed by generating the dianion of the P-ketoester under standard conditions (J.R. Peterson; T.J, Winger; C.P. Miller, Syn. Comm. (1988) 18(9):949-963), (NaH, /i-butyllithium, THF) and quenching with an appropriate symmetrical ketone of formula AAAA-6 (such as 4-heptanone). Hydrolysis of the ester (0.1 N NaOH/THF) and acidic work-up provide the dihydropyrone product of formula AAAA-7. Standard hydrogenation conditions reduce the olefin and deprotect the amine. Subsequent treatment of the amino compound with the appropriate sulfonyl chloride of formula AAAA-8 (pyridine, CH2CI2) provides the desired sulfonamide protease inhibitor of formula AAAA-9.<br>
CHART BBBB<br>
Alternatively, the palladium catalyzed allylic substitution may be performed with the sodium anion of the requisite dihydropyrone J.R. (Peterson; T.J. Winger; C.P. Miller, Syn. Comm. (1988) 18(9):949-963) of formula BBBB-1 (dihydropyrone, NaH, THF or DMF, 0°C) as the nucleophilic partner. Once again, if palladium allyl chloride dimer of formula BBBB-3 and a chiral phosphine ligand (P. von Matt; A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. (1993) 32:566-568) are employed as catalyst, a kinetic resolution results in the synthesis of optically pure allylated dihydropyrone of formula BBBB-4; and a stereoselective synthesis of the allylated product will occvir if the reaction with nucleophile is slow relative to isomerization of the two possible diastereomeric pi-allyl complexes by acetate generated from formation of the jDJ-allyl palladium intermediate. Subsequent, desilylation (p-TsOH, CH3CN), olefin reduction and amine deprotection (H2/Pd/C), and sulfonylation of the amine (ArS02Cl, pyridine, CH2CI2) with a compound of the formula BBBB-5 provides the desired dihydropyrone protease inhibitor of formula BBBB-6.<br>
CHART CCCC<br>
Treatment of m-bis(benzyl)aminobenzoic acid of formula CCCC-1 with oxalyl<br><br>
chloride to form the acid chloride and reaction with bis(trimethylsilyl)acetylene and AlClg in methylene chloride affords the propaR8yhc ketone of formula CCCC-2. Asymetric reduction of the ketone with a chiral borane (H.C. Brown; Beeraraghavan Ramachandran, P. Ace. Chem. Res. (1992) 25:16-24) such as DIP chloride [(+) or (-)-3-chlorodiisopinocampheylborane] and acetylene reduction with REDAL provides the allylic alcohol of formula CCCC-3, primarily as a single enantiomer. Formation of the carbonate of formula CCCC-4 (methyl chloroformate, pyridine, CHgClg, 0°C) and subjection to palladium catalyzed allylic substitution with the desired dihydropyrone of formula CCCC-5 as nucleophile affords primarily one enantiomer of the allylated dihydropyrone of formula CCCC-6 (retention of configuration) (T. Hayashi; T. Hagihara; M. Konishi; M.J. Kumada, Am. Chem. Soc. (1983) 105:7768-7770). This product is transformed into the desired protease inhibitor of formula CCCC-7 as previously described in Chart BBBB.<br>
CHART DDDD<br>
The known cycloalkylpyranones of formula DDDD-1 are prepared by acylation of the trimethylsilyl enol ether of the corresponding cycloalkyl ketone with malonyl dichloride as described in R. EfifenbeR8er, T. Ziegler, K-H. Schonwalder, T. Kesmarszky, B. Bauer Chem. Ber. 119: 3394-3404 (1986). Catalytic hydrogenation of the cycloalkylpyranones of formula DDDD-1 with platinum oxide (Pt02) in acetic acid produces the cycloalkyldihydropyrones of Formula DDDD-2. The intermediate of formula DDDD-3 is then formed by aluminum chloride (AlClg) catalyzed condensation of the compound of formula DDDD-2 with 3-nitrobenzaldehyde, which is commercially available. Subsequent reaction of the intermediate of formula DDDD-3 with trialkyl aluminums in the presence of copper bromide-dimethyl sulfide complex (CuBr-Me2S) or zinc reagents generated fi*om zinc metal, alkyl haUde, cuprous cyanide (CuCN) and lithium chloride (LiCl) provides compounds of formula DDDD-4 which contain a C-3a branched substituent. Catalytic hydrogenation of compounds of the formula DDDD-4 with Pd/C in ethanol (EtOH) provides the amine derivatives of the formula DDDD-5. Treatment of the compounds of formula DDDD-5 with sulfonyl chlorides of formula DDDD-6 and pyridine in methylene chloride (CH2CI2) provides compounds of the formula DDDD-7 (e.g., wherein n is 1, 2, or 3; Rj is ethyl or ^butyl; R2 is 4-cyanophenyl or 5-cyano-2-pyridyl).<br>

Those skilled in the art would know how to formulate the compounds of this invention into appropriate pharmaceutical dosage forms. Examples of the dosage forms include oral formulations, such as tablets or capsules, or parenteral formu¬lations, such as sterile solutions.<br>
When the compounds in this invention are administered orally, an effective amount is from about 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Either solid or fluid dosage forms can be prepared for oral administration. SoUd compositions are prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with conventional i    ingredients such as talc, magnesium stearate, dicalciiim phosphate, magnesium aluminum silicate, calcium sulfate, starch, lactose, acacia, methyl cellulose, or func¬tionally similar pharmaceutical diluents and carriers. Capsules are prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with an inert pharmaceutical diluent and placing the mixture into an appropriately sized hard gelatin capsule. Soft gelatin capsules are prepared by machine encapsulation of a slurR7 of the compounds of this invention with an acceptable inert oil such as vegetable oil or hght Uquid petrolatum. Syrups are prepared by dissolving the compounds of this invention in an aqueous vehicle and adding sugar, aromatic flavoring agents and preservatives. Elixirs are prepared using a hydroalcoholic vehicle such as ethanol, suitable sweeteners such as sugar or saccharin and an aromatic flavoring agent. Suspen¬sions are prepared with an aqueous vehicle and a suspending agent such as acacia,<br><br>
tragacanth, or methyl cellulose.<br>
When the compounds of this invention are administered parenterally, they can be given by injection or by intravenous infusion. An effective amount is from about 0.1 mg to 100 mg per kg of body weight per day. Parenteral solutions are prepared by dissolving the compounds of this invention in aqueous vehicle and filter sterilizing the solution before placing in a suitable sealable vial or ampule. Parenteral suspensions are prepared in substantially the same way except a sterile suspension vehicle is used and the compounds of this invention are sterilized with ethylene oxide or suitable gas before it is suspended in the vehicle.<br>
The exact route of administration, dose, or frequency of administration would be readily determined by those skilled in the art and is dependant on the age, weight, general physical condition, or other clinical symptoms specific to the patient to be treated.<br>
Patients to be treated would be those individuals:  1) infected with one or more than one strain of a human immunodeficiency virus as determined by the presence of either measurable viral antibody or antigen in the serum and 2) having either an asymptomatic HIV infection or a symptomatic AIDS defining infection such as i) disseminated histoplasmosis, ii) isoporiasis, iii) bronchial and pulmonaR7 -candidiasis including Pneumocystis, pneumonia, iv) non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, or v) Kaposi's sarcoma and being less than sixty years old; or having an absolute CD4+ lymphocyte count of less than 500/mm  in the peripheral blood. Treatment would consist of maintaining an inhibitoR7 level of the compounds of this invention in the patient at all times and would continue until the occurrence of a second symptomatic AIDS defining infection indicates alternate therapy is needed.<br>
The utility of representative compounds of the present invention has been demonstrated in the biological tests described below:<br>
The HIV protease screening assay is based on fluorescently labeled substrate which can be resolved from nonlabeled cleavage product using special beads coated with streptavidin. The substrate is biotinylated at the amino terminal aR8inine and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) at the carboxyl terminal lysine. This assay has been employed to detect novel, nonpeptidic inhibitors of HIV-1 protease. Substrate (20 vil of 0.2 pM), sample (10 pi of desired concentraion), and enzyme (10 pi of 0.1 pM) are added to a 96 well pandex plate. The assay is run in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 5.5 in the presence of 1.0 M sodium chloride and 0.05% NP-40 with incubated in the dark for one hour at room temperature. Strepavidin coated polystyrene beads {40 pi of 0.1% (w/v)} are added and the plate is<br><br>
incubated in the dark for an additional half hour. The labeled cleavage product is separated from the unreacted substrate via filtration and is read on the Idexx screen machine. The data are analyzed by appropriate computer algorithms to ascertain percent inhibition values.<br>
i	DeterminationofKj values utilizes the same materials and equipment<br>
employed for percent inhibition studies. Two-fold serial dilutions are made for a given inhibitor from 2, 3 or 4 starting concentrations with a total of 24, 36 or 48 individual inhibitor concentrations. These dilutions are performed utilizing the BioMek robotics system. The assay consists of 10 \iL of 40 nM HIV-1 protease, 10 liL of the various inhibitor concentrations, and 20 pL of 200 jiM substrate (40 uL total). The reaction is allowed to proceed for 90 min at room temperature, terminated with 40 pL of avidin beads and processed (supra vide). An inhibitor with a known Kj is run in parallel to verify the validity of the assay. The data is processed utilizing a computer program employing a nonlinear least square analysis of the data to generate the Kj values.<br>
The % inhibition values and/or K^ values of representative compounds of the present invention tested in the HIV protease screening assay are listed in Table I below.<br>
In the enzyme inhibition assay described above, the sensitivity of Kj value determination is in part limited by the ability to continue to lower the enzyme concentration for compounds with high binding affinity. To prevent de-dimerization at low enzyme concentration, a tandemly linked enzyme is prepared in which the two monomers are covalently linked by an appropriate stretch of amino acid residues. Using the latter enzyme, the sensitivity of the inhibition assay is improved since much lower enzyme concentration can be utilized, as compared to the condition using the wild-type enzyme.<br>
Protocol for Kj value determination with tandem HIV protease: Due to the greater stability (no dedimerization) of the single chain tethered (tandem) HIV protease enzyme, in which the two monomeric units are engineered to be linked by a polypeptide stretch, the method for the determination of Kj values for inhibitors uses veR7 low concentrations of enzyme (0.2 nM) and increased incubation times (96 hours) at room temperature to improve the sensitivity in the measurement of Kj values for veR7 potent inhibitors. The starting inhibitor concentrations are determined based on preliminaR7 enzyme inhibition screening results which estimate the expected potency of the inhibitor. Inhibitor concentrations are then prepared using the Biomek 1000 (Beckman) and the Quadra 96 (Tomtec). Substrate<br><br>
(biotinylated at the amino terminal aR8inine and fluorescently labeled with fluorescein at the carboxyl terminal lysine), inhibitor and the tandem enzyme are allowed to react in solution at pH 5.5 (buffers identical to those used with the native dimeric enzyme) in the dark for 96 hours. Streptavidin coated polystyrene beads are added to stop the reaction. The labeled cleavage product is separated from unreacted substrate via filtration. Residual fluorescence is quantitated with the Idexx SM2000 (Idexx) and the resulting data are analyzed using the NLLSF program.<br>
The % inhibition values and/or Kj values of representative compounds of the present invention tested in the HIV protease screening assay and/or tandem HIV protease assay are listed in Table II below.<br>

The resulting red, thick slurR7 is slowly treated with 6.0 mL of distilled hexamethylphosphoramide and allowed to stir for 30 min. The red, cloudy solution is then treated with 0,36 mL of benzyl bromide. The reaction quickly becomes a deep orange solution and is allowed to stir at 0°C for an additional 60 min. The mixture is quenched with excess 1 N aqueous hydrochloric acid and the resulting yellow, biphasic mixture is concentrated to remove the tetrahydrofuran. The resulting mixture is partitioned between dichloromethane and water and the acidic aqueous phase is further extracted with additional portions of dichloromethane. The combined oR8anic phase is dried over magnesium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The resulting material is diluted with a laR8e volume of diethyl ether and washed with dilute aqueous hydrochloric acid. The ethereal phase is washed with two additional portions of aqueous hydrochloric acid, once with brine, dried over magnesium sulfate, and finally concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is flash column chromatographed on silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) eluting with 1% acetic acid and 20% to 40% ethyl acetate in dichloromethane to give 440 mg of the title compouund as a tan solid.<br>
