DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to FIGS. 1 to 4 thereof, a new and improved liquefiable gas pressure cylinder embodying the principles and concepts of the present invention and generally designated by the reference numeral 10 will be described.<br>
More specifically, the liquefiable gas pressure cylinder 10 includes a main body or shell 100 with heads 200 at opposites ends thereof. The invention has been designed to conform to the requirements of 49 C.F.R. with dished ends or heads convex to pressure. The sides are crimped inward to each end to form chimes 150 which provide substantial grip for a lifting beam and also for easy installation of Safety Kit-B in case of emergency situation.<br>
The main body or shell 100 is a straight cylinder having a single longitudinal welded seam defining the cylinder body 102 and opposite axial end portions 104. One example of a suitable shell 100 can be 13/32 inch thick with a 29 1/4 inch internal diameter with a length of approximately 2000 pounds of chlorine, thus having the name of a ton container.<br>
The heads 200 are circular with a domed center portion 210 and a flanged periphery 220. The flanged periphery 220 has a cylindrical portion 222 surrounding the domed center portion, 210 and a radially extending edge portion 224. The outer diameter of the cylindrical portion 222 is the same as the internal diameter of the shell 100 so that when the heads 200 are mounted into the shell 100 with the domed center portion 210 extending axially inwardly, the cylindrical portion 222 is press-fitted into the end portions 104 of the shell 100. A gap 230 is left between the end axial edge 106 of the end portions 104 of the shell 100 and the side face 226 of the radially extending edge portion 224 of the head 200. The end axial edge 106 of the shell 100 is beveled at a first angle a of about 15° to a radius of the shell. The side face 226 of the radially extending edge portion 224 of the head 200 is machined to have a sharper radius and a corresponding face bevel at a<br>
second angle p of 15°. The overlap of the shell 100 with the cylinder portion 222 of the head 200 forms a lap joint configuration with the gap 230 also providing a side dam for the weld pool and an additional surface for forming the fusion weldment. The angle of the initial bevel is preferably from 13° to<br>
The minimum thickness acceptable for the head is 0.625 inches. The nominal thickness of the head or dome is selected so as achieve the minimum thickness. Generally, the nominally thickness is from 18 mm to 20 mm. The plates are initially procured with a positive mil tolerance. The profile of the central portion of the head dome is a segment of a sphere.<br>
Prior to initial assembly, the heads 200 are drilled for tapped holes 212 preferably a equiangular positions 120° apart at approximately 2/3 radius distance from center. The number and location of the holes 212 is determined by the particular application for which the container is being made. The holes 212 are tapped and after the welding and heat treatment (described herein below), fusible plugs 310 are screwed into the holes 212. In addition, one head 200 is fitted with two additional holes 214 which are also tapped. Appropriate valves 320 with siphon pipes 322 attached are installed in the additional holes 214. Three valve cover clips 330 are welded to the one head 200 at equiangular positions and a valve cover 332 is fitted over the valves 320 in a bayonet fitting manner. A name and data plate 340 can be provided on the domed center portion of the other head 200.<br>
After welding, the overlapping portions of the shell 100 and the heads 200 are cold formed to set the chimes 150, The result is a radially inwardly directed bend to the extent of at least 1 inch from the straight cylindrical diameters as measured before bending. The heads 200 and shell 100 are welded together by fusion welding. The preferred type of fusion welding is submerged arc welding.<br>
Post welding, the welds are radiographed 100%. That is, the complete length of the shell to head joint is fully ('100%) radiographed before the cold chiming. The technique used is by panoramic technique using a compensating ring to compensate for the thickness variation.<br>
Additionally, these welds are given a post weld heat treatment using a heating cycle including:<br>
a)	Loading temperature (maximum) = 800°F<br>
b)	Rate of heating = 400°F/hour<br>
c)	Soaking temperature = 1148 ± 18°F<br>
Soaking time = 60 minutes<br>
d)	Rate of cooling = 500°F/hour<br>
e)	Unloading temperature = 800°F.<br>
The finished container is pressure checked and ready for service.<br>
The containers will hold a minimum of 1600 pounds of water. Due to the greater density, the container wilt hold 2000 pounds of liquefied chlorine, thus common name "ton" container. The design pressure limit for a ton container is 225 pounds per square inch (gauge). The design temperature limits for a ton container are J35°F (maximum) and 32°F (minimum), respectively. The shell and head material for a ton container are preferably ASM6 SA516GR.70. The applicable design code is 49 C.F.R. 1,179(e). Other limits and materials may be more suitable together liquefiable gas usage.<br>
The initial container, after manufacturing, inspection including nondestructive testing, and post weld heat treatment, was hydraulically tested, Stretch measurement by dial gauges attached to shell and head was carried<br>
out before the hydro test, during the hydro test and after the hydro test to ensure that no permanent strain occurred.<br>
Using Finite Element Stress Analysis technique, certain of the areas of the cylinder were plotted where maximum stresses are present and the locations where displacements are maximum. Thereafter, the stresses at the circumferential weld were compared with the other areas to ensure that the weld of the heads to the shell is not the weakest area of the container.<br>
To validate the results obtained from the Finite Element Stress Analysis, the container was then subjected to Resistance Strain Gauge Measurement<br>
Test.<br>
The dished ends profile and thickness has been determined through fine element analysis and resistance Strain Gauge Testing to establish that the dished ends will reverse before any other part of the container i.e. longitudinal and circumferential weld joints or the valves are stressed beyond their yield limit.<br>
The container is in compliance with Chlorine Institute recommendation and is also compatible with safety kit B to handle the emergency situation like leaking of container.<br>
In order to prevent over pressure due to the exposure of the container to very high temperature, the cylinder has provision for installation for fusible plugs, which are filled with low melting alloys rated to melt suitable to the atmospheric conditions of a particular country where the container Is desired to be sold and used. This is an additional safety feature.<br>
The cylinders of the present invention should be handled with a suitable lifting beam in combination with hoist or crane of at least 2 Ton capacity. The<br>
ton containers being trucked should be carefully choked by wooden block or clamped down on cradles to prevent shifting and rolling during transit.<br>
Adequate provision has been made in the container by providing chiming DH both the ends for easy handling of the same, if required, rolling bands made out of steel can be provided to enable lifting of the containers by a fork lift.<br>
The unique features of the present invention resides in that<br>
the dished ends profile and thickness has been determined through Finite Elements Analysis and Strain Gauge Testing to establish that the dished ends will reverse before any other part of the container i.e., longitudinal and circumferential weld or the valves are stressed beyond their yield limit.<br>
The welded, x-rayed and chimed ends ensure that the stresses in the circumferential weld joints are very low. It has been established by Prototype Testing that even at four times design pressure the joints are safe.<br>
Another unique feature of the improved cylinder adds to safety is the fact that the container does not burst even if the pressure exceeds four times the maximum working pressure, in the even of a fire or accidental over-filling. In such an eventuality, one of the dished ends reverses outwardly thereby lowering the pressure.<br>
The welded construction of the circumferential joint ensures complete fusion between shell and the dished ends, which is verified through radiography, This is an improvement over the old forging process where lack of bonding during forging can go un-noticed.<br>
The cold chimed construction provides a safety features by not allowing slippage of the lifting tackle during handling of the container. The chimed construction also makes the container compatible with the Chlorine Institute kit B in case of an emergency situation.<br>
Information taken from Drawing sketch PV-034998 refereing Drawing PV-01-1241 Rev 8<br>
By carrying out the radiography testing of the welded joints before chiming, the various defects of the joints are detectable,<br>
In the cylinder the acceptance criteria are :<br>
a) Cracks or lack of fusion and lack of penetration are not acceptable irrespective of size, location and cause of origin. In other words, these defects, however small they may be are not acceptable.<br>
B)       Slag or other inclusions are not acceptable if their size is bigger than 6.00<br>
mm.<br>
Also if there are a number of small inclusions then their cumulative length shall not be more than the thickness of weld in a length equal to 12 times the weld thickness.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of the invention, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by the present invention.<br>
Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the invention. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
