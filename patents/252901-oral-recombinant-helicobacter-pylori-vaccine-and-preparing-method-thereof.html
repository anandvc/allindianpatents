				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to the field of biopharmaceuticals, especially relates to a recombinant protein used for immunoprophylaxis of human Helicobacter pylori infection and a degradable microsphere-encapsulated slow-releasing oral vaccine preparation prepared from the recombinant protein, and preparation method thereof.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The 2005 Nobel Prize in medicine/physiology was awarded to the two scientists who discovered the Helicobacter pylori (Hp).Helicobacter pylori is which is believed to be an important pathogenic bacterium for diseases of upper digestive tract in human and the main pathogenic cause of chronic gastritis, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer. Helicobacter pylori World health organization (WHO) has also confirmed that Hp is a pathogenic bacterium closely related to gastric cancer, classifying it as the primary carcinogenic factor. Hp is one of the bacteria with the highest infection rate in the world, with an infection rate reaching 50% in the global population and even higher in developing countries. In China, there are as many as six hundred million people infected with Hp, and every year two hundred thousand people die of gastric cancer. Thus, Hp is a major threat to human health. Despite of positive clinical significance, today’s antibiotic therapy of Hp infection still has some obvious drawbacks: 1) toxic and adverse side effects; 2) generation of drug resistant strains; 3) high cost; 4) lengthy treatment cycle and poor patient compliance; and 5) unstable therapeutic effect. On the other hand, vaccine is considered the most cost-effective means to control infectious diseases. Through inducing a specific immune response in the body, vaccination can be used to prevent or treat Hp infection. While the research progress in whole-cell vaccines is limited by the difficulty in large-scale cultivation of Hp and the existence of potential carcinogen in crude antigen, the development in genetically engineered vaccines has become the main direction owing to its safety, effectiveness, low cost, and ease in promotion and use. Although intensively researched both domestically and abroad, Hp vaccines have yet to be successful.<br>
Urease, a nickel-dependent enzyme, catalyzes hydrolysis of urea into ammonia and carbonic acid, and is the mostly abundant protein expressed in Helicobacter pylori both inside cells and on cell membrane, accounting for 5%-10% of the total Hp protein. Urease decomposes urea to produce ammonia, helping bacteria to colonize in the stomach by neutralizing gastric acid   as well as supplying ammonia for bacteria protein synthesis. Therefore, Host tissues of Hp may be injured directly by ammonia or indirectly by the stimulation of urease-induced inflammatory reaction. Blockage of urease gene expression can inhibit the colonization of Helicobacter pylori in the host, reduce bacterial protein synthesis, and lower the Helicobacter pylori-related inflammatory reaction. Urease B antibody can be detected in all Hp-infected patients especially those with notable symptoms, and the antibody level is, to certain extent, relevant to the seriousness of disease conditions. Oral injection of Helicobacter pylori urease or recombinant urease B subunit (rUreB) can protect mice against Helicobacter pylori infection and eliminate preexisting infection(Michetti et al., Gastroenterol.1994). The activity of urease seems to play an important role in Hp infection, as Hp with loss of activity of urease does not result in infection in animal model. Therefore, an antibody that neutralizes the activity of urease may play a crucial role in resisting against Hp colonization. The above findings indicate that urease antibodies, especially one that is capable of neutralizing the activity of urease, could exert the main role in resisting against Hp infection.<br>
Mucosal immune system is an important part of the body’s immune system, mainly including intestinal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and bronchus associated lymphoid tissue etc., and it exerts unique action with respect to body defense function. Mesenteric lymph nodes and large quantity of lymphocytes dispersed in lamina propria mucosae and intestinal epithelia constitute immune induction sites and immune effect sites. Through uptaking, processing and extracting antigens, various immunocytes on the surface of gastrointestinal mucosa etc. produce and secrete antigen-specific antibodies (mainly sIgA) which specifically bind with antigen-carrying bacterial or viral vectors to prevent them from colonizing to mucosa surface or invading body, thus exerting certain immunological defense function.<br>
 However; the severest defect of mucosal immune system is that it is liable to develop immunological tolerance to antigens. Even with enhanced level of antigen, the level of antigen-specific sIgA produced by the body or mucosa remains very low, and the immune defense ability to the infection of the antigen-carrying microorganisms is dismal.<br>
Heat labile toxin (LT) is a heat-labile enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and capable of inducing severe diarrhea in human and some domestic animals. LT is composed of one A subunit (LTA) and five B subunits (LTB). Spatially five completely identical LTBs form a circular pentamer, and the center of which lies the LTA with its C terminal bound to LTB via noncovalent bonds. The A subunit is composed of two subunits A1 and A2, linked by disulfide bond, wherein A1 is the toxic portion of the toxin whereasA2 binds with the B subunit. All the A and B subunits in cytoplasm exist in the form of precursor carrying signal peptides, and only assemble into intact LT after passing through cell membrane. The B subunit serves to specifically bind with GM1-ganglioside receptor on the surface of eukaryotic cell to make the conformational transition of LT molecule; the A subunit dissociates from the B subunit and enters into cell membrane, followed by disulfide bond degradation and A1 peptide chain activation; and the A1 subunit has the activity of GTP-independent ADP-ribosylation transferase, which destructs the degradation and balance of intracellular cAMP through G protein-mediated ADP-ribosylation reaction and triggers the rise of cAMP level, thus inducing toxin effect.<br>
LT is considered a promising mucosal immune adjuvant in recent years. The research by Rollwagen etc. showed that LT can strengthen  mucosal immune response to campylobacteria and accelerate the elimination of the bacteria in the intestinal tract; and furthermore, animals initially immunized with LT and an antigen do not develop immunological tolerance to the antigen even after a long-term observation.<br>
The viewpoint that LT can be used as mucosal immune adjuvant has been generally accepted (Lycke N, et al. Immunology, 1986, 59(2):301-308; Clements JD, et al. Vaccine, 1988, 6(3):269-277; Giuliani MM, et al. J. Exp. Med., 1998, 187(7):1123-1132). Since LT has very strong intestinal toxicity, consequently its B subunit or constructed nontoxic or low toxic LT mutant were mainly used as adjuvant (Yamamoto M, et al. J. Immunol., 1999, 162:7015–7021; Martin M, et al. J.Immunol., 2002, 169(4):1744-1752; Tamura SI, et al. Vaccine, 1994, 12:1238–1240). However, the A subunit of LT, in addition to its ADP-ribosyl enzyme activity, also relates to adjuvant activity (Giuliani MM, et al. J. Exp. Med., 1998). LTA chain stimulates the isotype switching of mucosa-associated B cells and meanwhile LTA participates in the initial phase of mucosal immune response, making type-fixed IgA B cells migrate from production site to distal effect site (DeHann L, et al. Vaccine, 1996;(4):260-266). De Haan etc. found that LT mutant lack of ADP-ribosyl enzyme activity still possesses adjuvant activity, suggesting that the adjuvant activity of LT is independent of  the A1 subunit with ADP-ribosyl enzyme activity while the A2 subunit may contribute to the adjuvant activity of LT. De Haan’s experiments also demonstrated that, through immunizing mice via nasal cavity mucosa, the LT mutant without toxic activity still keeps the immune properties of the wild-type toxin The single use of recombinant LTB shows a weaker immunogenicity than that of LT mutant without toxic activity (De Haan L, et al. Infect Immun, 1996), suggesting that the ADP-ribosyl enzyme activity of LTA does not directly relate to the immunity of the toxin. Additionally, LT whole toxin produces high-level systemic IgG and mucosal S-IgA responses while equal amount of LTB merely produces a low-level IgG response. That the immunogenicity of LT is stronger than that of LTB indicates that LTA plays an important role in the immune response of the toxin. Whereas the GTP-dependent ADP-ribosyl transferase activity possessed by the A1 subunit is related to the toxin effect, the adjuvant effect of the LTA is hinted mainly exerted by LTA2 subunit.<br>
LTB has been used as an immunological adjuvant at present. For example, LTB is fused with UreB to form recombinant protein LTB-UreB (Wuchao, Zou quanming etc. Research on fusion and expression of Helicobacter pylori UreB and Escherichia coli LTB genes. Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology, 2002,22(2):175-179), and can be prepared into intramolecular adjuvant vaccine. However, the immunoprotection rate of the recombinant protein has yet to reach the desired level.<br>
Based on above-mentioned, a recombinant Hp subunit intramolecular adjuvant vaccine with enhanced strength and complete protection against Helicobacter pylori infection, that can also be conveniently administered, is especially of demand in the field.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One of the objectives of the invention is to provide a recombinant protein used for immunoprophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection, and the recombinant protein can be prepared into recombinant Helicobacter pylori vaccine used for immunoprophylaxis of human Helicobacter pylori infection.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a method for preparing the mentioned recombinant protein used for immunoprophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection.<br>
A further objective of the invention is to provide a recombinant Helicobacter pylori vaccine used for immunoprophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection, which comprises the above mentioned recombinant protein used for immunoprophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection.<br>
Another objective of the invention is to provide a method for preparing the above mentioned recombinant Helicobacter pylori vaccine used for immunoprophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection.<br>
In order to realize above objectives, the invention provides a recombinant protein used for prophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection, and the recombinant protein (LTA2B-UreB, LU for short) is obtained by fusion of the A2 subunit and B subunit of the LT of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Helicobacter pylori urease B subunit. In the recombinant protein, LTA2B is used as an intramolecular mucosal immunological adjuvant and the UreB is used as an immunogen. LTA2B lacks the A1 portion that has ADP-ribosyl enzyme activity of a LT molecule, therefore overcomes the toxic and adverse side effects of a LT adjuvant. Meanwhile, comparing to commonly used adjuvant LTB, LTA2B for the first time adds in the A2 portion of the LT, thereby enhancing its adjuvant activity and immunogenicity.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, it is demonstrated that the LTA2B-UreB fusion protein has the similar biologic activity, immunogenicity, and reactionogenicity with the full-length UreB, and has the function of enhancing the activity of mucosal adjuvant.<br>
The invention also provides a slow-releasing microsphere-encapsulated oral preparation used for immunoprophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection, wherein the preparation encapsulates the above mentioned recombinant protein used for prophylaxis and treatment of human Helicobacter pylori infection.<br>
The invention adopts degradable slow-releasing microspheres (MS) to encapsulate the above-mentioned recombinant fusion protein. Firstly, the slow-releasing microspheres can effectively prevent the antigen from being decomposed and destructed by gastric acid and the enzymes in the digestive tract so as to retain the whole stability and activity of the antigen; secondly, since the MS particle diameter size determines its in-vivo distribution in various organs , manipulation of the preparation process of MS can control the particle diameter within a certain range, thereby purposely directing  the particles to targeted organs so as to maximize  immunological efficacy. When encapsulating the antigen, the particle diameter of MS and the adhesive action between the antigenic substance and MS can be modified through altering the proportion ratio of the carrier and antigen as well as the biodegradable carrier material, thus achieving the effect of long-lasting and slow release of the antigen.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said encapsulation substances include alginate, vegetable oil, calcium chloride, and chitosan. In a preferred embodiment, the particle diameter of said microsphere-encapsulated preparation is 3.33µm.<br>

The invention further provides a nucleotide sequence encoding said recombinant protein, wherein the nucleotide sequence is ltA2B-ureB (lu for short) formed by fusion of the coding gene of A2 subunit and the coding gene of B subunit of heat-labile enterotoxin of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and the coding gene of urease B subunit of Helicobacter pylori.<br>

(3) constructing the fusion gene ltA2B-ureB on a vector, transforming a host, and expressing recombinant protein LTA2B-UreB; and<br>
(4) separating and purifying the recombinant protein obtained from the step (3).<br>

The obtained recombinant plasmid comprises at least one encoding nucleotide sequence of the LU amino acid sequence or the amino acid sequence having above 95% homology to it and also having its protein activity.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, recombinant protein LTA2B-UreB is expressed from said recombinant engineered bacteria by fermenting in 80L fermentor.<br>
The invention also provides a method for preparing an oral recombinant Helicobacter pylori vaccine, which comprises the following steps: <br>
(1) proportioning the recombinant protein obtained in claim 9 with sodium alginate, vegetable oil, calcium chloride, and chitosan, and preparing into degradable slow-releasing microsphere-encapsulated preparation; and<br>
(2) optionally preparing the slow-releasing microsphere-encapsulated preparation into freeze-dried product.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the obtained recombinant protein is evenly mixed with sodium alginate solution, followed by adding vegetable oil, after emulsification, adding dropwise to calcium chloride solution by reverse titration, and preparing into sodium alginate-encapsulated protein microsphere preparation; the obtained microsphere preparation is then immobilized, followed by washing and centrifugation to collect pellets, and re-suspending; it is added to a chitosan solution for re-encapsulation to obtain protein microspheres double encapsulated by chitosan and sodium alginate; the microsphere suspension is slowly poured into vials with liquid level lower than 1cm, followed by pre-freezing in an refrigerator at -400C for 12 h, directly placing in a chilled vacuum drier for drying, slowly raising the temperature to rapidly sublimate water, and taking out the freeze-dried product for testing when a gas pressure indicator shows no gas is being generated.<br>

2.	Construction and screening of engineered bacteria highly expressing fusion protein<br>
Recombinant expression plasmid containing LU fusion gene was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21, and plasmid was extracted, digested, and identified. Figure 2 is the agarose gel electrophoresis pattern for digestion identification of recombinant expression plasmid pET-11c-LU/BL21(DE3), wherein lane 5 is NdeI digestion product of recombinant plasmid pET-11c-LU/BL21(DE3); lanes M1 and M2 are molecular weight marker of nucleic acid (DNA); lane 4 is NdeI single enzyme digestion product (5700bp) of empty vector plasmid. The digestion fragment size was consistent with the experiment design, suggesting the construction of recombinant plasmid was successful. The preparation and transformation of competent bacteria of genetically-engineered Escherichia coli BL21, and the extraction and digestion identification of the plasmids of recombinant bacteria were the same as previously described.<br>
Accurately-identified recombinant bacteria were inoculatede to 3ml of kanamycin-containing LB culture fluid, and were shaken at 370C overnight. In the next day the overnight-cultured recombinant bacteria were transfer-inoculated at a ratio of 1% to 20 mL of kanamycin-containing LB culture fluid, and were shaken at 370C for 2.5 h, induced with IPTG for 5 h, and the expression pattern and expression amount of the fusion protein were detected by SDS-PAGE, and highly-expressed strains were screened, as shown in figure 3.<br>
The invention also verified the stability of UreB and LTA2B and that whether they could replace the full-length protein of urease B through experiments. PCR method was adopted to amplify target LTA2B, and UreB and LTA2B fragment genes, followed by constructing to prokaryotic expression vector pET-11c(+), transforming into host bacteria Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and stably expressing LTA2B-UreB fusion protein by inducing with IPTG. Firstly, ELISA and immunoblotting assay verified that recombinant LTA2B-UreB had good immunogenicity and reactionogenicity; secondly, the produced antibody in rabbit immunized with purified LTA2B-UreB neutralized the activity of urease in vitro and showed the similar biological activity to UreB of natural HP; further, the oral immunization of recombinant LTA2B-UreB in BALB/c mice was capable of effectively stimulating body to produce Th1/Th2-balanced immune response, which was consistent with recombinant UreB (Wuchao, Zou quanming etc. Research on fusion and expression of Helicobacter pylori UreB and Escherichia coli LTB genes. Chinese Journal of Microbiology and Immunology, 2002,22(2):175-179); finally, challenge protection test in mice showed that the protection rate of LTA2B-UreB was 91.6% which was significantly higher than the protection rate 68% of the full-length UreB. GM1-ELISA test, indicating that the fused LTA2B-UreB had no ADP ribosyl-enzyme activity while retained the biological property of binding with ganglioside GM1.The challenge protection test in mice also showed that the protection rate of LTA2B-UreB was significantly higher than the protection rate 74.1% of UreB-LTB and the protection rate 78.6% of physically-mixed combination of UreB and LTB. For the first time it has been demonstrated that LTA2B-UreB has the similar biological activity, immunogenicity, and reactionogenicity to that of full-length UreB, and has the function of strengthening the activity of mucosa adjuvant.<br>
Example 3 Fermentation of recombinant engineered bacteria pET-11c-LU/BL21(DE3)<br>
Fermentation process as follows: Germany B.Bron 80L fermentor was adopted; the inoculation ratio of seed strain for fermentation process was 10%; temperature was at 370C; and pH was at 7.0. The pH value was kept constant by automatically adding 30% ammonia water; the revolution was initially set at 500rpm, and the revolution was changed to dissolved oxygen cascade control along with the increase of the bacteria cells and the enhancement of oxygen consumption, that is, a PO2 controller was used as main controller and a stirring controller was used as servo controller; the dissolved oxygen concentration was controlled by cascade control and negative oxygen bypass control and its final concentration was controlled within 45%-50%; batch materials are not fed when A600 was less than 2 h, followed by flow adding batch materials once every 0.5 h to make the final concentrations of glucose, tryptone, and 8% yeast extract were 0.5%, 0.2%, and 0.2% respectively. After the fourth addition of batch materials and when the glucose concentration reduced to 0.1%, 500µmol/L IPTG was added to induce for 4h and bacteria were collected; and flow addition of batch materials was based on the batch culture controlled by dissolved oxygen cascade control during fermentation process.<br>
The culture medium used for fermentation process was modified M9-CAA culture medium, which was based on M9-CAA and supplemented with 0.6% yeast extract liquid and 2mg/L ZnCl2•4H2O, 2mg/L CoCl2•4H2O, 4mg/L FeSO4•16H2O, 5mg/L H3BO3, 1.6mg/L MnCl2•4H2O, and 4mg/L CuSO4.<br>
Bacterial suspension was recovered after the fermentation was completed and centrifuged at 8000g for 15 min. The supernatant was sucked and discarded and bacteria were collected, weighed, and stored by freezing for subsequent use.<br>
Results: the results showed that the yields of the bacteria were all higher than 75g/L; and the expression amounts of the target proteins were all stabilized at 30% or so, which demonstrated that the mid-scale fermentation process was advanced and had higher levels in both reproducibility and stability.<br>
Example 4 Purification of recombinant protein LU (LTA2B-UreB)<br>
1. Extraction of inclusion body: 5000g of highly-expressed bacteria were suspended in TE buffer solution in a ratio of 1:10(W/V), and then evenly mixed with a cell homogenizer after pre-chilling at 40C. A high-pressure homogenizer was adopted to break up bacteria cells under a pressurized condition of 40-70Mpa (totally for 4-6 times) Once finished, a small amount of the bacteria broth was taken, smeared, dyed, to observe the integrity of the cells under a microscope to ensure cells  were completely broken up. The bacteria broth was then centrifuged at 500g for 25 min, after discarding pellets, again centrifuged at 15,000g for 40 min.  Then supernatant was discarded and pellets collected; sequentially washing with washing liquids A and B at a ratio of 1:10(W/V) for 2 times respectively under such washing conditions: stirring at 40C for 20 min, centrifuging at 15,000g for 40 min, and collecting the pellets of inclusion bodies; finally, mixing the inclusion bodies with an inclusion body lysing liquid at a ratio of 1:10(W/V), stirring at 40C for 3 h, centrifuging at 15,000g for 45 min, and taking the supernatant as the raw material for next step purification.<br>
Buffer solution used for inclusion body extraction: 1) TE buffer solution: 20 mmol/L Tris, 5 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0; 2) inclusion body washing solution A: 5 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0; 3) inclusion body washing solution B: 20 mmol/L Tris, 2mol/L Urea, pH 8.0; 4) inclusion body lysing liquid: 1 mmol/L EDTA, 20 mmol/L Tris, 8 mol/L urea (pH 8.0).<br>
2. Chromatography purification: the purification step was determined as Q Sepharose HP anion exchange column and Sephadex G-25 column chromatography purification, and mid-scale purification was performed by using XK50/30 column on an ÄKTA explorer100 system. Since ÄKTA explorer100 system has the characteristics of accurate automation, two sets of ÄKTA explorer100 systems were adopted to perform continuous automatic chromatography operation through programming and the mid-scale yield of each batch of rHp vaccine can reach 40 g. The target protein was purified by using 20 mmol/L Tris and 5mmol/L EDTA under pH of 8.0 and NaCl gradient elution was adopted.<br>
3. Although the purity of the recombinant protein purified by Q Sepharose High Performance chromatography reached above 80%, large amount of salt and urea existed, therefore a method of gel-filtration chromatography was adopted for desalting and removing urea according to differences in molecular weight by using conventional molecular sieve filler Sephadex G-25 medium.<br>
4. The purified target protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE to determine its purity. The purity and yield of the finally-obtained target protein were higher than 80% and 79%, respectively.<br>
5. Protein concentration determination by Lowry method<br>
Wherein, the cell-breaking rate of the high-pressure cell-breaking technique used in production of step 1 or mid-scale purification was greater than 98%, and inclusion body pellets were obtained by differential centrifugation.<br>
The affinity chromatography purification filler in step 2 was selected from Chelating Sepharose Fast Flow.<br>
The anion purification filler in step 3 was selected from Q Sepharose HP, Q Sepharose FF, and Q Sepharose XL.<br><br>
Example 5 Preparation of oral recombinant HP vaccine<br>
1. Preparation of recombinant LU protein microspheres<br>
The recombinant protein prepared in example 4 was evenly mixed with 2% sodium alginate solution under room temperature, followed by adding a vegetable oil, wherein the ratio of the vegetable oil to sodium alginate AGS emulsion was 2:8, emulsifying at 8000 r/min for 10 min, adding dropwise to CaCl2 solution, stirring at  800 r/min for 30 min to form an O/W emulsion, centrifuging to collect pellets, washing, and resuspending; adding the suspension to 1% concentration of chitosan solution, stirring at 800rpm for 30 min to complete re-encapsulation to give prepared chitosan-sodium alginate double encapsulated recombinant LU protein microspheres, centrifuging and washing for three times, and collecting.<br>
The above microsphere suspension was slowly poured into a glass plate in an liquid level height lower than 1cm, then pre-freezing in a refrigerator at -400C for 12 h, directly placing in a pre-chilled vacuum drying machine for drying, slowly raising the temperature to rapidly sublimate water, and taking out the freeze-dried product for testing when the gas pressure indicator shows that there was no gas being generated.<br>
Respectively taking little amounts of centrifuged and washed MS, freeze-dried powder, and re-dissolved freeze-dried powder, smearing them onto glass slides, observing under an optical microscope the morphologic change of the microspheres before and after freeze-drying: under the optical microscope we saw that the sizes and shapes of the microspheres after centrifugation and washing were regular, the microspheres after freeze-drying were in irregular distribution including many irregular shapes such as rod shape, spindle shape, and oblate shape, while the number and shapes of the microspheres re-dissolved with equal amount of distilled water substantially restored to original characteristics before freeze-drying. The prepared MS have plump surface, homogenous size, and an average particle diameter of 3.33µm.<br><br>
2. Freeze-drying of recombinant LU protein microsphere solution<br>
The highly-purified recombinant LU protein was properly diluted, prepared, and loaded into freeze drying vials for freeze drying. A stable and mature rHp vaccine freeze dying curve was obtained through studies: the pre-freeze temperature of the product was -450C and the pre-freeze time was 4 h; the temperature of the first sublimation was 200C and sublimation time was 30 h; the temperature of the second sublimation was 300C and sublimation time was 8 h; the entire duration of the whole freeze drying process was 42 h; water contents were all less than 3%, which met detection requirements with respect to water content of freeze-dried products as recorded in the second part of«Pharmacopoeia of The People's Republic of China»(2000 edition).<br>
Through systemic research on the freeze-drying pilot process, the excipient of the freeze-dried rHp vaccine preparation was determined as 8% mannitol, the stabilizing agent was 0.05% EDTA-Na2, and optimal pH value was 10.0; and mature parameters such as freeze-drying curve were obtained. Over 20 batches of repeated verifications manifested that the freeze-drying pilot process was stable in performance and met the requirements for scale production. Forty grams of vaccine protein can be dispensed into about 2600 vials calculated as 15 mg of packaged amount of each freeze-drying vial. The adopted 5 m2 of freeze-drying machine can freeze dry and prepare about 5000 freeze drying vials with diameter of 32 mm in one time, meeting the requirements for freeze drying of large quantity of products.<br>
The invention has further revealed the influence of artificial gastric fluid on the stability of the rHp vaccine. Since the rHp vaccine is a freeze-dried preparation for oral immunization, during the process of reaching target organs through digestive tract inevitablely it has to pass through the acidic pH environment in stomach. A protein substance in nature, the rHp vaccine is liable to be denatured by acid action or degraded by enzymes, thus reducing its immunological activity. Research discovered that the antigen reactivity of the rHp vaccine protein was obviously reduced and protein degradation was marked in an artificial gastric fluid with pH values of 1 and 2, while a higher antigen reactivity and protein stability were retained in an environment with pH of 3-7. The research result indicated that, during the application process, a method of neutralizing gastric acid can be adopted to properly raise the pH value of the environment in stomach, so as to retain the biological activity of the rHp vaccine protein and thus acquiring favorable immune effects. With respect to the dosage form for an oral recombinant vaccine, an advanced and practical process for poly-microencapsulated preparation resistant to gastric acid and pepsin was established, overcoming the destruction by gastric acid and pepsin. As a result, the efficacy and the stability of the vaccine were improved.<br><br>
Example 6 Animal experiments of oral recombinant HP vaccine<br>
1. Safety evaluation in animals<br>
LD50 was not calculated since no abnormal reaction, toxic symptom and death were observed in any tested mice in the LD50 group, meanwhile the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the rHp vaccine for oral intake was greater than 150mg/kg (equal to 600 times of the recommended normal dose for human body) as detected through maximum tolerated dose test. During the period of observation after intraperitoneal injection of three batches of rHp vaccine, all of the three batches of guinea pigs survived without abnormal toxic reaction and all the guinea pigs gained weight normally up to the seventh day. The following experiments were respectively carried out and the results indicated that the rHp vaccine had a good safety profile.<br><br>
2. Research on immunogenicity<br>
The immunogenicity of the rHp vaccine was observed by respectively using rabbit, BALB/c mice, and rhesus monkey.<br>
(1). Research on immunogenicity of rHp vaccine by immunization of rabbits<br>
Double immunodiffusion test and ELISA detection were performed after immunizing rabbits with the rHp vaccine, and the results showed that the vaccine induced rabbits to produce high titer of antiserum against UreB, which demonstrated that the rHp vaccine protein had good immunogenicity.<br>
(2). Research on immunogenicity of the rHp vaccine by immunization of BALB/c mice<br>
Each group of BALB/c mice was simultaneously fed with a prepared Hp bacterial suspension at the 10th day after the last immunization. All of the experimental animals were subjected to fasting diet and water 24 h in advance, and each BALB/c mouse was fed with 0.3ml of bacterial suspension of about 108cfu/ml (colony forming units per mL) respectively in the morning and the afternoon with an interval time of 6 h, and was provided with diet and water 2 h after the last feeding. All of the experimental animals were killed 4 weeks after the challenge and samples were collected, wherein fasting diet and water was performed 24 h before the sacrifice; followed by dissecting the BALB/c mice, taking out the stomach, splitting along the greater curvature of the stomach, slightly rinsing out the residuals from the stomach with normal saline, smearing half of the gastric mucosa tissue onto a Hp culture medium, performing three-line streak inoculation, and carrying out microaerophilic culture. The colonization of Hp in mice after immunization was shown in table 1.<br>
Table 1. Challenge immunoprotection effects on mice after oral immunization of fusion protein<br>

 “UreB-LTB” and “LTA2B-UreB” represent fusion protein, and “UreB+LTB” and “UreB+LTA2B” represent the physical mixing of two kinds of recombinant proteins.<br>
The results denoted that the protection rate of the mice in LU-immunized group (the sixth group) reaches above 90%.<br>
Conclusion: the immunization of the fusion vaccine antigen LU to mice can produce effective protection against whole-cell Hp challenge as compared with non-immunized group.<br>
BALB/c mice confirmed with Hp infection were immunized by intramuscular injection of, respectively, LU fusion protein, in vitro mixture of the two subunits, and controls, all mixed with equal volume of aluminum adjuvant. Injections were made at a dose of 100µg (100uL) per mouse at the 0th, the 2th, and the 4th week respectively. Mice were then killed 4 weeks after the last immunization and samples were collected; and the bacteria-carrying status of the mice after treatment was observed through different experimental methods.<br>
Table 2. Observation of Hp-infected mice treated with multi-subunit protein vaccine<br>
Group	Number of post-treatment mice without detected Hp	Number of post-treatment mice with greatly-reduced  number of colonized Hp<br>
LU treatment group (30 mice)	21	9<br>
Two subunit mixing group (30 mice)	23	7<br>
Control group (30 mice)	0	1<br>
The p value was lower than 0.001 as shown by the statistical analysis of the two group results, which illustrated that the immunotherapy on infected mice with the vaccine antigen LU or two in-vitro-mixed subunits effectively reduced the bacteria-carrying number in mice or eliminated the infection of the mice. The multi-subunit vaccine antigen including fusion antigen LU had certain therapeutic effects on Hp infection.<br>
3. Experimental research on oral immunization of the rHp vaccine in rhesus monkey<br>
The research discovered that the levels of both anti-UreB IgG antibody in serum and sIgA antibody in saliva significantly rose after rhesus monkeys were subjected to oral immunization of the rHp vaccine, and maintain to the 15th week after immunization, which demonstrated that this vaccine can induce rhesus monkey to produce significant systemic immune response and mucosal immune response.<br>
In order to investigate the relationship between the vaccine dose and the immune response level, three different doses were adopted for oral immunization; and the results showed that the induced systemic and mucosal immune response levels in both groups with doses of 0.5 and 2.0 mg/kg were significantly higher than that of the group with a dose of 0.2 mg/kg. No obvious difference was seen between the two groups with the higher doses, suggesting that the optimal dose of the vaccine for oral immunization of rhesus monkey was 0.5 mg per kg of body weight.<br>
The above animal experiments in rabbits, BALB/c mice, and rhesus monkeys have confirmed that the rHp vaccine can effectively induce the mucosal immune response of the bodies and has favorable immunogenicity.<br><br>
