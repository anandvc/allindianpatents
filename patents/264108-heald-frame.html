Description<br>
Heald frame<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a heald frame with at least one frame<br>
part and with at least one heald carrying rod which is fastened to the frame<br>
part.<br>
[0002]	In order to achieve high weaving speeds, the aim is to have<br>
heald frames with as low a weight as possible. Despite the low weight, they<br>
must have high deformation resistance or flexural resistance, so that the<br>
healds are not loaded and/or damaged due to deformations of the heald<br>
frames. The healds themselves are to be held with play, in particular, in the<br>
raising and lowering direction of the heald frames, so that, in the repair of a<br>
warp thread break, they can easily be pushed to one side, without the risk of<br>
deformations of and/or damage to the healds. The heald carrying rods are to<br>
consist of as wear-resistant a material as possible. In practice, therefore,<br>
there is provision for the frame parts to be produced from a material of low<br>
specific gravity, in particular from aluminum or an aluminum alloy. The heald<br>
carrying rods are preferably produced from steel or similarly wear-resistant<br>
materials. Since the frame parts, on the one hand, and the heald carrying<br>
rods, on the other hand, consist of different materials which behave differently<br>
under stress and, in particular, are deformed differently, problems arise in<br>
practice.<br>
[0003]	It is known (US 31 51 634) to provide the frame parts in each<br>
case with a flange which is directed toward the opposite frame part and which<br>
is reinforced by means of a longitudinal rib. The heald carrying rods, which<br>
possess a flat strip-shaped configuration, are fastened to this longitudinal rib<br>
of the frame parts. They have, on the side facing away from the longitudinal<br>
rib, a wide longitudinal groove, the depth of which corresponds approximately<br>
to half the thickness of the heald carrying rod. At a plurality of locations within<br>
the longitudinal groove, longitudinal slots are provided, into which are in-<br><br>
P 44769 WO/US + IN	2<br>
serted mounting plates which are somewhat shorter than the slots. Spacer<br>
plates are arranged on the longitudinal rib of the frame parts. The heald car-<br>
rying rods and the mounting plates are assigned clamping plates. The entire<br>
subassembly is held together by means of rivets which penetrate into the<br>
longitudinal rib of the flange of the frame part. It has been shown that a de-<br>
sign of this type is relatively susceptible to fatigue fractures which occur due<br>
to relatively low, but changing forces. The bores in which the rivets are held<br>
on the flange of the frame part are particularly at risk.<br>
[0004]	It is also known (US 37 54 577) to attach to the flanges of the<br>
frame parts two webs which run in the longitudinal direction and between<br>
them form a longitudinal groove. This longitudinal groove serves for receiving<br>
a middle web of T-shaped heald carrying rods. The middle web of these T-<br>
shaped heald carrying rods is held in the longitudinal grooves by means of an<br>
adhesive. The manufacture of T-shaped heald carrying rods of this type is<br>
relatively complicated and therefore costly, particularly when they are pro-<br>
duced from a high-grade material.<br>
[0005]	The object on which the invention is based is to provide a heald<br>
frame of the type initially mentioned which is also suitable for high weaving<br>
speeds and which can be produced as cost-effectively as possible.<br>
[0006]	This object is achieved in that a multiplicity of projections ar<br>
ranged essentially one behind the other in a row are shaped out of the heald<br>
carrying rod by means of plastic deformation and are held in a clearance or<br>
the like of the frame part.<br>
[0007]	By means of the projections formed by plastic deformation, an<br>
essentially strip-shaped heald carrying rod is provided, which in functional<br>
terms is comparable essentially to a T-shaped heald carrying rod and which<br>
can be attached to a frame part in a corresponding way to a T-shaped heald<br>
carrying rod.<br><br>
P 44769 WO/US + IN	3<br>
[0008] In an embodiment of the invention, there is provision for the<br>
frame part to be provided with a longitudinal groove which runs in the longitu-<br>
dinal direction of the heald carrying rod and in which the projections of the<br>
heald carrying rod are held.<br>
[0009] In an embodiment of the invention, there is provision, further, for<br>
tabs to be bent out from the heald carrying rod. In this case, there is advanta-<br>
geously provision for the tabs to be bent about a bending axis running essen-<br>
tially transversely with respect to the longitudinal direction of the heald carry-<br>
ing rod. In this embodiment, there is advantageously provision, further, for the<br>
width of the tabs of the heald carrying rod to correspond essentially to the<br>
width of the longitudinal groove. This affords a mechanical hold between the<br>
heald carrying rods and the frame part.<br>
[0010]	Further features and advantages of the invention may be gath-<br>

Fig. 12         shows a section through a frame part with a heald carrying rod<br>
according to fig. 10 and 11.<br>
The heald frame illustrated in fig. 1 possesses an upper frame part 10 and a<br>
lower frame part 11 which are connected to one another by means of two<br>
side parts 12, 13 to form a frame. The frame parts 10, 11 have the same<br>
cross section and are arranged mirror-symmetrically in respect to one an-<br>
other in such a way that two flanges 14, 15 lie opposite one another. Fas-<br>
tened to these flanges 14, 15 are heald carrying rods 16, 17 on which healds<br>
18 are guided by means of eyes 19, 20. The healds 18 are provided with<br>
thread eyes through which the warp threads run. The eyes 19, 20 are guided<br>
on the heald carrying rods 16, 17 with a play such that the healds 18 can be<br>
displaced relatively easily on the heald carrying rods 16, 17, for example in<br>
order to eliminate a warp thread break.<br>
[0011]	In the exemplary embodiment, the frame parts 10, 11 have a pro-<br>
file of identical cross section. The heald carrying rods 16, 17 are likewise de-<br>
signed identically and are fastened to the frame parts 10, 11 in the same way,<br>
so that the following description, which refers to the upper frame part 10 and<br>
the upper heald carrying rod 16, also applies in the same way to the lower<br>
frame part 11 and the heald carrying rod 17.<br><br>
P 44769 WO/US + IN	5<br>
[0012] The upper frame part 10 and the lower frame part 11 are, for ex-<br>
ample, extruded profiles consisting of aluminum or of an aluminum alloy.<br>
They are configured such that they possess as low a weight as possible, but<br>
high flexural resistance. The heald carrying rods 16, 17 are steel profiles,<br>
preferably extruded steel profiles.<br>
[0013]	A multiplicity of projections arranged one behind the other in a<br>
row are shaped out of the heald carrying rods 16, 17 by means of plastic de-<br>
formation, by means of which projections the heald carrying rods 16, 17 are<br>
fastened to the flanges 14, 15 of the frame parts 10, 11. In the exemplary<br>
embodiment according to fig. 1 to 4, perforations 22 have first been made in<br>
the middle region of the heald carrying rods 16, 17, said perforations having<br>
adjoining them on both sides short incisions 23, 24 running in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the heald carrying rod. These incisions make it possible for pro-<br>
jections in the form of tabs 25, 26 to be bent out from the heald carrying rod,<br>
as illustrated for the heald carrying rod 16 in fig. 2, 3 and 4. The tabs 25, 26<br>
are located approximately in the longitudinal center of the heald carrying rod<br>
16, said longitudinal center lying in the region of a longitudinal groove 27, the<br>
depth of which corresponds approximately to half the thickness of the heald<br>
carrying rod 16. As can be seen particularly from fig. 3 and 4, in each case<br>
two tabs 25, 26 lie opposite one another in pairs. In the exemplary embodi-<br>
ment, the tabs 25, 26 are first bent out of the plane of the heald carrying rods<br>
16 about a bending axis running essentially transversely with respect to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the heald carrying rod 16 and are then bent back in<br>
the direction of the heald carrying rod 16 at a distance from this bending axis.<br>
[0014]	As can be seen from fig. 2, the tabs 26 have a width which corre-<br>
sponds essentially to the width of a longitudinal groove 28 formed between<br>
two webs 29, 30 which project from the flange 14 in the direction of the heald<br>
carrying rods 16 and which run in the longitudinal direction of the latter. The<br>
tabs 25, 26 are secured in the longitudinal groove 28 by means of an adhe-<br>
sive.<br><br>
P 44769 WO/US + IN	6<br>
[0015] The tabs 25, 26 may be bent out of the plane of the heald carry-<br>
ing rod 16 before the latter is mounted on the flange 14 of the frame part 10.<br>
It is also possible, however, to press the tabs out of the plane of the heald<br>
carrying rods 16 and into the longitudinal groove 28 of the flange 14 when the<br>
heald carrying rod 16 already bears against the two webs 29, 30 which be-<br>
tween them form the longitudinal groove 28.<br>
[0016] The projections, formed by plastic deformation, of the heald car-<br>
rying rods 16, 17 may be provided in highly diverse forms. In the embodiment<br>
according to fig. 5, there is provision for only one form of tabs 26 to be bent<br>
out of the heald carrying rod 16 in each case. In the embodiment according to<br>
fig. 6, tabs 31 which project essentially perpendicularly from the outer surface<br>
of the heald carrying rod 16 are bent out of the heald carrying rod 16.<br>
[0017]	In the embodiment according to fig. 7, the tabs 25, 26 of the<br>
heald carrying rod 16 which are directed oppositely to one another are ar-<br>
ranged at a greater distance from one another. The tabs preferably stamped<br>
out from the heald carrying rod 16 can advantageously be glued into the lon-<br>
gitudinal groove 28 of the frame part 10, 14 and afford relatively good secur-<br>
ing against displacement in the longitudinal direction.<br>
[0018]	In the embodiment according to fig. 8, the tabs 25, 26 are bent<br>
out of the bottom of the longitudinal groove 27 toward the open side of the<br>
latter, that is to say oppositely to the tabs 25, 26 of the embodiment according<br>
to fig. 3. In this embodiment, the heald carrying rod 16 is mounted on the<br>
frame part 10 or 11 such that the longitudinal groove 27 faces the longitudinal<br>
groove 28.<br>
[0019]	In the embodiment according to fig. 9, the projections 32 are<br>
pressed in the form of loops or eyes out of the heald carrying rod 16. For this<br>
purpose, the heald carrying rod is provided in the region of the projections 32<br>
in each case with parallel longitudinal slots which make it possible for the pro-<br><br>
P 44769 WO/US + IN	7<br>
jections 32 to be pressed out. The longitudinal slots may be formed and the<br>
projections 32 pressed out in one operation or else in a plurality of operations<br>
in succession.<br>
[0020]	In the embodiment according to fig. 10 to 12, the heald carrying<br>
rod 16 is provided with boss-like projections 32 which are pressed out on one<br>
side and which lie one behind the other in a row and are pressed out of the<br>
material of the heald carrying rod 16 only to an extent such that sufficiently<br>
large surfaces are present which are sufficient to allow gluing into a clearance<br>
of the flange 14 of a frame part. The projections 32 have been pressed out<br>
from the heald carrying rod 16 only to an extent such that the approximately<br>
parallel top sides and undersides of the projections are also still connected to<br>
the material of the heald carrying rod 16. In the embodiment according to<br>
fig. 10 to 12, the projections are not provided in the region of a longitudinal<br>
groove 35 of the heald carrying rod 16, but, instead, in the region 33 which is<br>
located beneath it and which has a greater thickness. The longitudinal groove<br>
35 and the region 33 located beneath it and also that region 34 of the heald<br>
carrying rod 16 which lies above it are designed such that they can receive<br>
healds 18 having J-shaped guide elements 36.<br>
[0021]	In a modified embodiment, there is provision for the projections<br>
produced by plastic deformation to be arranged in more than one row running<br>
in the longitudinal direction of the heald carrying rod, for example in two rows.<br>
A heald carrying rod of this type can then be fastened to a frame part in such<br>
a way that the projections of the heald carrying rod surround a longitudinal rib<br>
of the flange 14 or 15 of the frame parts 10 or 11 from above and below.<br>
[0022]	In another modified embodiment, there is provision for the projec-<br>
tions to be bent out in a tab-like manner about bending axes running in the<br>
longitudinal direction of the heald carrying rod. Tab-like projections of this<br>
type may also have a hook-like configuration, engaging behind corresponding<br>
profilings of the frame part and bringing about additional mechanical secur-<br>
ing. In this case, use may be made of the fact that the heald carrying rods<br><br>
P 44769 WO/US + IN	8<br>
may be attached to a projection of a flange 14 or 15 of the frame parts 10, 11<br>
or in a longitudinal groove by displacement in the longitudinal direction.<br>
[0023]	In a modified version, the frame parts 10, 11 are made from fiber-<br>
reinforced plastic, in particular from plastic reinforced with carbon fibers or<br>
Kevlar fibers. The invention is also suitable for heald frames which have only<br>
one frame part 10 or 11 with a heald carrying rod 16 or 17 fastened to it.<br><br>
