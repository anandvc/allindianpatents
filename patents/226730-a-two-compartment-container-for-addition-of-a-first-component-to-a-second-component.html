BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to packages and containers, and in particular, pertains to<br>
containers having two compartments and that may be used to keep two components separate<br>
until use.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Many different types of packages have been designed to enable product components<br>
to be kept separate until use and, in some cases, to allow one component to remain sterile<br>
until use of the product. In one type of two-compartment package, a stopper or other means<br>
is placed in the hole between the two compartments. For example, the two-compartment<br>
container of Halm (U.S. Patent No. 5,417,321) comprises a one-piece container having two<br>
compartments assembled one upon another interlinked by a stoppered opening. The<br>
disclosure of all patents referred to herein is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Other two-compartment packages utilize a perforating unit to allow the two<br>
previously separated components to mix. See, for example, the patents of Goncalves (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,170,888 which has a glass defining a first compartment, which is provided with<br>
a neck upon which is mounted a bottle defining a second compartment, with a membrane<br>
between the two compartments that is perforated when a perforating unit is displaced<br><br>
relative to the glass, and U.S. Patent No. 4,757,916 which has two units separated by a<br>
cover perforatable as a result of the manipulation of a mixing perforator). The two-part<br>
container of Wiegner (U.S. Patent No. 4,103,772) has a frangible partition of coated<br>
aluminum foil dividing the compartments and a piercing member mounted on a resilient<br>
portion transversely directed toward the partition. In the patent of White (U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,637,934) rigid penetrating means are used to penetrate a compartment closing diaphragm<br>
to allow nursing liquid to flow from the compartment to a communicating, attached nipple.<br>
Two compartment packages have also been previously developed which have an<br>
opening container attached to the top of the package and are provided with a screw cap and<br>
a cylinder jacket shaped supporting ring. The cylinder jacket shaped supporting ring is<br>
attached to the top of the package by means of a fixing flange externally surrounding the<br>
opening disc and is provided on its inner surface with a raised thread. The ring surrounds<br>
the external thread of the plastic screw cap. A cutter is integrally molded onto the free edge<br>
of the screw cap, and is provided with a front cutting edge which passes at an angle through<br>
the free edge.<br>
For such products as two-part epoxy glues, two compartments are also needed to<br>
keep the products from reacting, as in the patent of Wilkinson et al. (U.S. Patent No.<br>
4,786,279).<br>
The dispenser of Renault (U.S. Patent No. 5,564,600) has two compartments<br>
separated by a sealing member sealed against a seat, so that movement of one of the<br>
containers relative to the other causes the sealing member to move away from the seat and<br>
form an annular passage between the sealing member and the seat.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,209,718 and 6,105,760 and the co-pending application (S.N.<br>
09/775,486) disclose a two-compartment package, which keeps a first component separate<br>
from a liquid component until use, so that the first component does not become wetted until<br>
just before use. The two-compartment package keeps at least one of the components sterile<br>
until just before use, at or before which time, the two components may be easily mixed.<br>
The prior invention can thus be used for containers for the separate packaging of dried<br>
microbial cultures which are to be added to a food, liquid nutrition, medicine, or beverage<br>
product just before consumption, for the separate packaging of carbonation tablets from a<br>
liquid until just before consumption, and for separate packaging of vitamins or other<br>
unstable components before addition to a beverage, liquid nutrition, medicine or beverage<br>
before consumption.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,098,795 and the co-pending application (S.N, 09/592,217) disclose<br>
a container and means for adding a selected component to a main package, thus forming a<br>
two-compartment container that keeps a first component, which may, for example, be<br>
moisture sensitive, from a second component, preferably a liquid, until a selected time<br>
before use. The delivery package, preferably containing a second component in a<br>
compartment inside a cavity in the delivery package, may be mountable on the outside<br>
surface of a main package. A puncture means is provided for cutting through the<br>
compartment and the main package to gain access to the main package, for example, to<br>
release the first component from the compartment into the main package. Alternatively, the<br>
main package may be a bag, such as an enteral bag in the preferred use of the first<br>
embodiment. In the second embodiment of the invention, the main package preferably is<br>
for holding a liquid beverage, and the delivery package is attached to the main package<br>
during the manufacturing process.<br>
In some cases, such as with aseptically-filled bottles or cartons, there is a need to<br>
provide a means for adding a selected separate first component to a package after<br>
manufacture of the package and/or at a location on the package, which component may vary<br>
in concentration and/or composition, depending, for example, on the patient's history and<br>
diagnosis. Providing a means of attaching a first compartment to a package after both the<br>
first compartment and package have been manufactured allows a user to select both a<br>
particular first component to add to a package and the time and place of addition of the first<br>
component to the package. There is also need to have the capability to add beverage<br>
additives, particularly degradable or moisture-sensitive or oxygen-sensitive components (for<br>
example, vitamins) to liquid beverage bottles at or just before the time the beverage is<br>
consumed.<br>
The types of structures used for many prior two-compartment containers are<br>
complicated and often subject to leakage. Thus, there remains a need to have two-<br>
compartment packages which keep a first component separate from a liquid component until<br>
use, so that the first component does not become wetted until just before use, that keep at<br>
least one of the components sterile until just before use, and in which the two components<br>
may be easily mixed just before use, and which has minimal or no leakage prior to mixing<br>
of the components and once the components have been mixed. For example, mere is a need<br>
for such containers for the separate packaging of dried microbial cultures which are to be<br>
added to a food, liquid nutrition, medicine, or beverage product just before consumption, for<br><br>
the separate packaging of carbonation tablets from a liquid until just before consumption,<br>
and for separate packaging of vitamins or other unstable components before addition to a<br>
beverage, liquid nutrition, medicine or beverage before consumption.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a two-compartment container that<br>
keeps a first component, which may be moisture sensitive, from a second component,<br>
preferably a liquid, until a selected time before use.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide a two-compartment container that<br>
has improved manufacturability and decreased leakage.<br>
Other objects and advantages will be more fully apparent from the following<br>
disclosure and appended claims.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention herein is a two-compartment container. The first compartment has an<br>
upper layer and a lower layer and contains a first component that is to be added to the<br>
second compartment. Above the first compartment is a dome that is bowed upward and is<br>
flexible. Below the dome is a cutting means, preferably formed in one piece with the dome.<br>
Depressing the dome by pushing downward on it lowers the cutting means so mat either the<br>
lower layer only or both the upper and lower layer of the first compartment are cut by the<br>
cutting means, releasing the first component into the second compartment. The cutting<br>
means may be a simple puncturer, or in the case where the second compartment comprises a<br>
beverage container or the like, the cutting means may be the lower part of a wall<br>
surrounding the opening through which someone can drink the beverage.<br>
Other objects and features of the inventions will be more fully apparent from the<br>
following disclosure and appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION AND PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS THEREOF<br>
The present invention provides an improved two-compartment container having a<br>
cutting means to release a sensitive component from a first compartment into a second<br>
compartment, with minimal or no possibility of leakage around the cutting means or the<br>
opening of the second compartment<br>
As used herein, the relative directional terms "above", "below" and the like are used<br>
to specify the relative orientations of 	the parts of the invention when the container is a<br>
bottle, carton or the like oriented having the opening of the second compartment facing<br>
upward. In particular structures or usages of the container of the invention, the container<br>
may be oriented in other manners without departing from the invention herein, and it is<br>
understood mat in such instances, the actual orientation of the parts of the invention are<br>
correspondingly changed.<br>
In particular, the invention herein is container 10 comprising a first compartment 12<br>
and a second compartment 14 (Figures 1-7). Although generally the second compartment<br>
14 serves as the main compartment containing second component C2 that is normally a<br>
liquid, and the first compartment 12 serves as a delivery package for a first component C1 to<br>
be added to the second compartment 14, it is understood mat by use of the terms "main"<br>
package and "delivery" package as used herein, no limitation is placed on the absolute or<br>
relative sizes of the packages. The terms are used merely to distinguish the two packages by<br>
difference in function and structural characteristics, with the main package including<br>
packages known in the prior art for holding substances and the delivery package preferably<br>
designed for holding a first component to be added to the main package. In the preferred<br>
embodiments herein, the second compartment 14 is a screw-capped bottle or a carton, such<br>
as a juice carton as is knows in the art.<br><br>
The first compartment 12 has an upper layer 16 and a lower layer 18 and contains a<br>
first component C1 that is to be added to the second compartment 14. The structure of the<br>
first compartment 12 is preferably similar to those disclosed in the parent applications<br>
hereto, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference. Thus, a preferred first<br>
compartment 12 is preferably made of foil, and most preferably of foil having a plastic layer<br>
on one surface on the outside of the compartment, such as a polyethylene laminated<br>
aluminum foil, for example, Catalog No. PETP12 of Danisco (Allborg, Denmark).<br>
Above the first compartment 12 is a dome 20 that is part of the cap 24 covering the<br>
second compartment 14 and that is bowed upward and is flexible. Preferably, the dome 20<br>
is formed of a thin flexible plastic material, as is known in the art. Extending below the<br>
dome 20 is a cutting means 22A,B,C, which is most preferably an integral part of the dome<br>
20, but made of a shape, size and rigidity to enable piercing of upper layer 16 and lower<br>
layer 18.<br>
In the first and second embodiments (Figures 1-4), collar 36 extending above a<br>
threaded area 38 of the cap 24 holds the dome 20 suspended over the second compartment<br>
14. Thus, in use of these embodiments of the invention, depressing the dome 20 by pushing<br>
downward on it lowers the cutting means 22A.B within the collar 36 so that both the upper<br>
layer 16 and lower layer 18 of the first compartment 12 are cut by the cutting means 22A,B,<br>
releasing the first component Cl into the second compartment 14. This structure enables up<br>
and down movement of the cutting means 22A,B inside the container 10, which unlike the<br>
prior art, has no part moving inside another where there might be leakage from the outer<br>
part due to the movement.<br>
In the first embodiment of the invention herein, shown in Figures 1-2, the cutting<br>
means 20 is a simple puncturer 22A mat protrudes downward from the dome 20. The<br>
configuration of the cutting means 22A may be tailored for different types of puncturable<br>
materials. Preferably, the pointed end 30 is a simple conical shape without protrusions or<br>
alternatively, the pointed end 30 may be conical with a serrated or scalloped cross-section as<br>
in the parent applications. As shown in Figure 2, depressing the dome 20 causes the simple<br>
puncturer 22A to be pushed through both the upper layer 16 and the lower layer 18, so that<br>
first component C1 is released into the second compartment 14.<br>
In the second embodiment of the invention (Figures 3-4), which is particularly<br>
useful where the second compartment 14 comprises a beverage container or the like, the<br>
cutting means 22B may be part of a wall surrounding the opening through which someone<br><br>
can drink the beverage. Thus, as shown in Figure 3, in this embodiment, the dome 20 is<br>
preferably located on the top of the cap 24 of the beverage container. The dome in this<br>
embodiment has a central opening surrounded by a tube 21. The bottom of the tube 21<br>
comes to a point 32, which forms the cutting means 22B in this embodiment. Point 32 may<br>
be any shape that is able to puncture the upper layer 16 and the lower layer 18. Over the<br>
tube 21, a nipple 26 through which liquid can be withdrawn, and having inner lips 28 to seal<br>
the opening as is known in the art, is placed to keep the package from leaking when not in<br>
use. Depressing the dome 20 lowers the cutting means 22B as the tube 21 is lowered, thus<br>
puncturing both the upper layer 16 and lower layer 18 of the first compartment 12. Nipple<br>
26 closes by itself when not in use, and pressure from inside the container 10 increases the<br>
extent of closure of the nipple 26.<br>
In the first and second embodiments shown in Figaros 1-4, the first compartment 12<br>
hangs downward, with the upper layer 16 and the lower layer 18, both being pierced when<br>
the dome 20 is depressed as shown in Figures 2 and 4. In these cases, both layers 16, 18<br>
are preferably relatively thin and easily puncturable. In contrast, in the third embodiment<br>
shown in Figures 5-6, the first compartment 12 is bowed upward, with the upper layer 16<br>
preferably being quite thick, such as being made of a thick plastic and/or foil material. The<br>
flat lower layer 18 is a thin, easily puncturable foil. There is a shorter cutting means 22C as<br>
shown in Figures 5-6 to make room for the upwardly bowed first compartment 12 and<br>
because cutting means 22 C does not need to go all the way through the first compartment.<br>
Thus, when dome 20 is depressed in this embodiment, it pushes upper layer 16 downward<br>
as shown in Figure 6, so the intact but pushed downward upper layer 16 is pushed against<br>
and ultimately punctures lower layer 18 as shown, without puncturing upper layer 16.<br>
In the alternative embodiment of the dome of the invention shown in Figure 7, there<br>
is no collar 36 extending to the top of the dome 20 and the dome 20 is not suspended over<br>
the second compartment 14. Rather, dome 20 sides 40 in this embodiment sit directly on<br>
the layer that extends across the top of the second compartment (either upper layer 16 or<br>
lower layer 18).<br>
In both embodiments, mere is preferably an outer cap 34 over the cap 24, as shown<br>
in Figures 1,3 and 5, which prevents accidental depression of the dome 20 prior to use,<br>
such as during snipping and storage. The form of this cap 34 may be any known in the art<br>
or as may be useful, and is not a specific part of the invention herein.<br>
The invention is primarily designed for addition of a selected, sensitive first<br><br>
component C1, preferably located in first compartment 12, to a liquid located in the main<br>
package (second compartment 14). The term "selected" first component C1 as used herein<br>
includes first components) chosen for a particular use, e.g., addition to a bottle or carton to<br>
be used by a person requiring additional vitamins or antibiotics, or having a particular<br>
volume or concentration, and the like. The first component may be a single compound,<br>
mixture, solution, capsule, powder, or any other containable components) to be added to a<br>
main package that preferably contains a second component (which may in turn be any<br>
containable compound(s) to which the first component may be added to result in a useful<br>
product. The ability to select from an assortment of pre-packaged first components in the<br>
first embodiment herein allows the purchaser to purchase and store first and second<br>
components separately, for example, to keep non-perishable second components at room-<br>
temperature, and to keep first compartments, each of which has one of any number of<br>
assorted first components under appropriate, possibly separate, storage, for later addition to<br>
the second component. When the first component Cl comprises microorganism cells, the<br>
first component is preferably in a powdered formulation as described in the parent<br>
applications hereto.<br>
The term "sensitive" includes first components which are moisture-sensitive, or<br>
which interact with the second component, for example, by forming by-products that change<br>
the usefulness of the combined components, for example, from initially useful to too weak,<br>
due, for example, to loss or change of strength or value with time after the combination of<br>
components. "Sensitive" first components also include those components that may require<br>
special storage and/or handling until just before addition to a second component, for<br>
example, refrigeration, desiccation, or heating; as well as first components mat for any other<br>
reason(s) are desired to be kept separate from a second component between the time of<br>
manufacture and until a later time, such as the time of addition to a second component.<br>
It is preferred mat the first component be in the form of a powder that is stable when<br>
dry and that is easily dissolved or suspended in the liquid in the main package as disclosed<br>
in the parent applications hereto. The invention is particularly useful for adding unstable<br>
and/or sterile components to a beverage, liquid enteral nutrition or medicine, for example,<br>
adding vitamins or beneficial gastrointestinal microorganisms, such as Lactobacillus<br>
reuteri, to fruit juice, milk, water, and medicine.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to specific embodiments, it<br>
will be appreciated that numerous variations, modifications, and embodiments are possible,<br><br>
and accordingly, all such variations, modifications, and embodiments are to be regarded as<br>
being within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
