DESCRIPTION<br>
WATER-ABSORBENT AGENT COMPOSITION AND METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING SAME<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a water-absorbent agent composition containing a polycarboxylic acid water-absorbent agent as a main component, and the manufacturing method thereof. More specifically, the present invention relates to a water-absorbent agent composition superior in liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property, and the manufacturing method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventionally, a water-absorbent agent composition is widely used as a main construction material of sanitary materials (absorbent articles) such as disposable diapers, sanitary napkins, incontinence pads and the like, in order to absorb body fluids (e.g. urine, blood, and the like). Well-known examples of the water-absorbent agent composition are (i) crosslinked partially neutralized poly acrylic acid; (ii) a hydrolyzed starch-acrylonitrile graft polymer; (iii) a neutralized starch-acrylic graft polymer; (iv) a saponified vinyl acetate-acrylic ester copolymer; (v) crosslinked carboxymethylcellulose; (vi) hydrolyzed acrylonitrile copolymer or hydrolyzed acrylamide copolymer, or crosslinked acrylonitrile copolymer or crosslinked acrylamide copolymer; (vii) a crosslinked polymer of a cationic monomer, (viii) a crosslinked isobutylene-maleic acid copolymer; (ix) a crosslinked polymer of 2-acrylamide-2-me thylpropanesulfonic acid and acrylic acid; (x) and the like.<br>
There has conventionally been needs for a water-absorbent agent composition having the following water-absorbent properties: (i) a high absorbency for a aqueous liquid such as a body fluid, (ii) an excellent absorption speed, (iii) excellent liquid permeability, and (iv) excellent gel strength of a swollen gel, and (v) an excellent updrawing property when water is absorbed from a base material containing a aqueous liquid, (vi) and the like.<br>
Recently, the sanitary material such as the disposal diaper has higher performance and a thinner size. Along with this, an usage amount and usage ratio (mass %: a ratio within an absorptive article) of the water-absorbent agent composition tends to increase so as to achieve sufficient absorbency without causing leakage of liquid even in a thin absorptive article.<br>
The sanitary material which includes a larger amount of the water-absorbent agent composition is preferable in terms of liquid storage itself. However, when a large amount of the water-absorbent agent composition is used, the water-absorbent resin becomes soft and gelatinous upon absorbing water. This causes a gel blocking phenomenon. As a result, a liquid absorbing property of the diaper significantly drops, which causes leakage of liquid.<br>
In view of such a problem, the liquid permeability of the water-absorbent agent    composition    is    attracting    attention    in    recent    years,    and    some<br><br>
water-absorbent agent compositions claiming higher liquid permeability have been published (eg. Documents 1 through 7).<br>
However, to make the conventional water-absorbent agent composition to express high liquid permeability, the gaps between the particles constituting the water-absorbent agent composition are generally increased by increasing the size of particles (the liquid permeability is proportional to the size of gap between the particles). Therefore, the gel gaps or the gaps between particles of general water-absorbent agent composition superior in liquid permeability are large. On the other hand, the liquid updrawing property is positively related to the capillary force between particles. It is known that a larger gap between particles means a smaller capillary force, that is, the liquid updrawing property is inversely related to the size of gap between the gels or the gap between the particles. According to this, an increase in liquid permeability by providing larger particle gaps causes a decrease in liquid updrawing property.<br>
Moreover, it is another known fact that the particle size distribution is<br>
well-contributed    to    the    liquid    permeability.	In    view    of    this,    some<br>
technologies for controlling the particle size of water-absorbent agent composition have been suggested (eg. Documents 8 through 11). These technologies however have a problem of decrease in liquid updrawing property when the particle size is increased. The liquid permeability is an important factor of the water-absorbent agent composition which has been attempted to be achieved in the many conventional technologies (eg. Documents 12 and 13). However, since the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property are incompatible in the water-absorbent agent composition, there has been a serious difficulty in ensuring both of them.<br>
Document 14 and some other applications disclose techniques for overcoming this defect. The water-absorbent agent compositions according to these technologies are specifically controlled for its particle size distribution, and their surfaces contain quadrivalent polyol or polyol of a greater valency (eg. Document 14),<br>
However, even in these conventional technologies, the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition still decreases depending on the conservation condition or due to process damage by the manufacturer when the water-absorbent agent is used as a material of an absorptive article such as paper diaper.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a water-absorbent agent composition which ensures superior liquid permeability and superior liquid updrawing property, which were conventionally incompatible with each other. Moreover, the water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention causes less decrease in liquid updrawing property.<br>
The inventors of the present invention intensively sought for a solution of the foregoing problems, and have found that a water-absorbent agent composition superior in liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property can be achieved by specifying a particle size and containing water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles into the composition. The inventors also found that such a water-absorbent agent composition can be easily manufactured by mixing a water-absorbent agent specified in particle size and liquid permeability in advance with slurry of water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles. The inventors thus completed the present invention.<br>
In order to attain the foregoing object, a water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention contains as a main component a polycarboxylic acid water-absorbent agent having a crosslinking structure which is produced by polymerizing an acid-group-containing unsaturated monomer, the water-absorbent agent composition containing water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles, the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the following set of conditions (a) through (e):<br>
(a)	decreasing rate of a liquid distribution velocity (LDV) is not more than 30%;<br>
(b)	saline flow conductivity (SFC) is not less than 60 (Unit: 10-7cm3• s/g);<br>
(c)	mass average particle diameter (D5O) is 200 to 420 µm;<br>
(d)	logarithm standard deviation (oF) of particle size distribution is 0.25 to 0.40;<br>
(e)	percentage of particles less than 150 µm in diameter is not more than 3 mass % with respect to the whole particle amount.<br><br>
With these features, the water-absorbent agent composition according to the<br>
present invention contains a less amount of the component of particles of<br>
small-diameter, and its particle size is adjusted to ensure the foregoing<br>
superior liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property. Moreover, due<br>
to inclusion of the specific water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles,<br>
the water-absorbent agent according to the present invention has a great<br>
LDV and a superior updrawing property. Furthermore, the decreasing rate<br>
of LDV of this water-absorbent composition is low, and therefore the liquid<br>
updrawing property does not easily decrease even with environmental<br>
changes due to, for example, inappropriate storage or process damages at a<br>
manufacturer of sanitary materials (eg* a diaper) using the water-absorbent<br>
agent as a material. Furthermore, the water-absorbent agent composition<br>
has a high SFC, and therefore ensures superior liquid permeability after<br>
liquid absorption. Therefore, the water-absorbent agent according to the<br>
present invention with the foregoing characteristics ensures the following<br>
effects: it is superior in both liquid permeability and liquid updrawing<br>
property, which were conventionally incompatible; and it causes less<br>
decrease    in    liquid    updrawing    property*	The    water-absorbent    agent<br>
composition of the present invention is therefore useful for high-performance diaper.<br>
In order to attain the foregoing object, a water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention contains as a main component a polycarboxylie acid water-absorbent agent having a crosslinking structure which is produced by polymerizing an acid-group-containing unsatu rated monomer, the water-absorbent agent composition containing water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles, the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the following set of conditions (a') through (d'),<br>
(a')   content  of particles   300   to   600  µm   in   diameter   is   not  less   than   30<br>
mass %<br>
(b') average gap radius index under no pressure is less than 310 µm<br>
(c*) a liquid distribution velocity (LDV:  measured before the LDV resistance<br>
test) is not less than 2.Omm/s<br>
(d') saline flow conductivity (SFC) is not less than 30 (Unit: 10-7cm3xs*g l)<br>
With these features, the water-absorbent agent composition according to the<br>
present invention contains a less amount of fine particles, and its particle<br>
size is adjusted to ensure the foregoing superior liquid permeability and<br>
liquid updrawing property. Moreover, due to inclusion of the specific<br>
water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles, the average gap radius<br>
index under no pressure of the water-absorbent agent according to the<br>
present     invention     is     small.	Therefore,     the    water-absorbent    agent<br>
composition has a great capillary force and a superior updrawing property.<br>
Furthermore, the water-absorbent agent composition has a high LDV, and<br>
therefore ensures superior liquid updrawing property. Furthermore, the<br>
water-absorbent agent composition has a high SFC, and therefore ensures<br>
superior    liquid    permeability    after    liquid    absorption.	Therefore,    the<br>
water-absorbent agent according to the present invention with the foregoing characteristics ensures the following effects: it is superior in both liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property, which were conventionally incompatible; and it causes less decrease in liquid updrawing property. The water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is therefore useful for high-performance diaper.<br><br>
Further, in order to attain the foregoing object, a method for producing a water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention comprises the step of:<br>
(a)	carrying out crosslinking polymerization of an unsaturated monomer<br>
solution constituted of a monomer containing as a main component an<br>
acrylic acid and/or its salt in the presence of an internal crosslinking agent<br>
so as to produce a crosslinked polymer,<br>
the method further comprising the steps of:<br>
(b)	drying the crosslinked polymer, adjusting the particle size of the<br>
crosslinked polymer, and carrying out another crosslinking with respect to a<br>
vicinity of the surface of each particle of the crosslinked polymer so as to<br>
obtain a water-absorbent agent which satisfies the following set of conditions<br>
(i) through (iv):<br>
(i) mass average particle diameter (D5O) is 200 to 500  µ m;<br>
(ii) percentage of particles less than  150 µm in diameter is not more than 5<br>
mass % with respect to the whole particle amount;<br>
(iii) logarithm standard deviation (o£)  of particle size distribution is 0.25 to<br>
0.45;<br>
(iv) saline flow conductivity (SFC) is not less than 30 (Unit: lO^cm^s^g-i);<br>
and<br>
(c)	mixing the water-absorbent agent with water-in soluble organic or<br>
inorganic fine particles 1 to lOOnm in average particle diameter,<br>
wherein:<br>
the water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles are processed into a slurry 0.1 to 50 mass % in solid content to be mixed with the water-absorbent agent.<br>
According to this method, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles are<br>
processed into a slurry 0.1 to 50 mass % in solid content to be mixed with<br>
the     water-absorbent     agent.	By     thus     mixing     the     water-in soluble<br>
organic/inorganic particles in the form of slurry with the water-absorbent agent, the water-absorbent agent is mixed with water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles which are no longer significantly agglomerated, in other words, the water-soluble organic/inorganic particles to be mixed with the water-absorbent agent are close to individual primary particles. Since the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles whose particle diameters are small are put in the water-absorbent agent, they hardly widen the gaps between the particles of the water-absorbent agent.<br>
Further, by using hydrophilic water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles as the slurry (or in a dispersion state) of water-insoluble fine particles, it is possible to improve the hydrophilic property of the surface of the water-absorbent agent without deteriorating the capillary force of the water-absorbent agent. On this account, it is possible to further improve the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent.<br>
Moreover, liquid, such as water, is added to the water-absorbent agent at the same time the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles are added. On this account, polymer molecules of the water-absorbent agent are slightly swollen, and the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles are put in the water-absorbent agent with the polymer network open.<br><br>
Therefore, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles slightly enter into the water-absorbent agent from the surface thereof. Thus, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles hardly separate from the water-absorbent agent. Therefore, the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition hardly deteriorates even with environmental changes due to inappropriate storage or process damages at a manufacturer of sanitary materials (eg. diaper) using the water-absorbent agent as a material.<br>
The foregoing water-absorbent agent contains a less amount of the component of particles of small-diameter, and its particle size is adjusted to ensure the foregoing superior liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property. Therefore, the water-absorbent agent composition manufactured by this water-absorbent agent is superior in liquid permeability. Therefore, the foregoing method produces water-absorbent agent composition which ensures the following effects: it is superior in both liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property, which were conventionally incompatible; and it causes less decrease in liquid updrawing property.<br>
Additional objects, features, and strengths of the present invention will be made clear by the description below. Further, the advantages of the present invention will be evident from the following explanation in reference to the drawings.<br>

Among these, the partially neutralized polyacrylic acid polymer having the cross-linked structure obtained by polymerizing and cross-linking a monomer containing acrylic acid and/or its salt (neutralized product) as the main component is particularly preferable.<br>
The range of the acid-group-containing unsaturated monomer includes a monomer which becomes an acid-group through hydrolysis after the polymerization, such as acrylonitrile. A acid-group-containing unsaturated monomer which contains the acid group at the time of polymerization is more preferable.<br>
When a monomer contains acrylic acid and/or its salt is used as the main<br>
component, the other monomer may be used together. Examples of the<br>
monomer to be used with acrylic acid and/or its salt include water-soluble or<br>
hydrophobic unsaturated monomers, such as methacrylic acid; maleic acid<br>
(maleic anhydride); fumaric acid; crotonic acid; itaconic acid; vinyl sulfonic<br>
acid;	2-acrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic	acid	or	2-<br>
methacrylamide-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid; acryloxyalkane sulfonic acid or methacryloxyalkanesulfonic acid and its alkali metal salt or its ammonium salt; N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone; N-vinylacetamide; acrylamide or methacrylamide; N-isopropyl acrylamide or N-isopropyl methacrylamide; N,N-dimethyl acrylamide or N,N-dimethyl methacrylamide; 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate or 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate; methoxypolyethyleneglycol acrylate or methoxypolyethyleneglycol methacrylate; polyethylene glycol acrylate or polyethylene glycol methacrylate; isobutylene; lauryl acrylate or lauryl methacrylate; etc.<br>
When using a monomer other than acrylic acid (salt), the amount of the monomer other than acrylic acid (salt) is preferably 0 mole% to 30 mole% with respect to the total amount of acrylic acid and/or its salt used as the major component, and more preferably 0 mole% to 10 mole%. With this arrangement, it is possible to further improve the absorption property of the resulting water-absorbent agent (composition), and also possible to obtain the water-absorbent agent (composition) at lower cost.<br>
The crosslinked structure is essential for the water-absorbent agent. An internal crosslinking agent may be used to form a crosslinked structure, or the water-absorbent agent may be a self cross-linking type which does not require an internal cross-linking agent. However, it is preferable that the water-absorbent agent be a water-absorbent agent obtained by copolymerizing or reacting an internal cross-linking agent (an internal cross-linking agent of the water-absorbent agent) having, in one molecule, two or more polymerizable unsaturated groups and two or more reactive groups.<br>
Specific examples of the internal cross-linking agent include N,N'-methylenebis acrylamide or N,N'-methylenebis methacrylamide; ethyleneglycol diacrylate, polyethyleneglycol diacrylate, ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate or polyethyleneglycol dimethacrylate; propyleneglycol diacrylate, polypropyleneglycol diacrylate, propyleneglycol dimethacrylate, or<br><br>
polypropyleneglycol dime thacry late; trimethylolpropane triacrylate or<br>
trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate; glycerin triacrylate or glycerin<br>
trimethacrylate; glycerin acrylate methacrylate; ethylene oxide modified<br>
trimethylolpropane triacrylate or ethylene oxide modified trimethylolpropane<br>
trimethacrylate;	pentaerythritol	hexaacrylate	or	pentaerythritol<br>
hexamethacrylate; triallyl cyanurate; triallyl isocyanurate; triallyl phosphate; triallyl amine; polyallyloxyalkane or polymethallyloxyalkane; ethyleneglycol diglycidyl ether or polyethyleneglycol diglycidyl ether; glycerol diglycidyl ether; ethylene glycol; polyethylene glycol; propylene glycol; glycerin; pentaerythritol; mesoerythritol; xylitol; sorbitol; ethylene diamine; ethylene carbonate; propylene carbonate; polyethyleneimine; and glycidyl acrylate or glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
These internal cross-linking agents may be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds. The internal cross-linking agent may be added to a reaction system either at once or partially several times. In the case of using at least one kind of internal cross-linking agent or two or more kinds of internal cross-linking agents, it is preferable that a compound having two or more polymerizable unsaturated groups be required to be used at the time of polymerization in view of the absorption property, etc. of the resulting water-absorbent agent or water-absorbent resin composition.<br>
The amount of the internal cross-linking agent to be used is preferably in a range from 0.001 mole% to 2 mole% with respect to the amount of the monomer (excluding the cross-linking agent), more preferably from 0.005 mole% to 1 mole%, further preferably from 0.005 mole% to 0.5 mole%, still further preferably from 0.01 mole% to 0.5 mole%, yet further preferably from 0.01 mole% to 0.2 mole%, especially preferably from 0.03 mole% to 0.2 mole%, and most preferably from 0.03 to 0.15 mole%. When the amount of the internal cross-linking agent to be used is smaller than 0.001 mole%, and when the amount of the internal cross-linking agent to be used is larger than 2 mole%, it may not be possible to obtain a sufficient absorption property(s) (for example, the water-soluble component becomes too much, the water absorption ratio becomes low, etc.).<br>
When introducing the crosslinked structure into a polymer by using the internal cross-linking agent, the introduction timing is not especially limited, and the internal cross-linking agent may be added to the reaction system before the polymerization of the monomer, during the polymerization, after the polymerization, or after the neutralization.<br>
When polymerizing the monomer to obtain the water-absorbent agent used in the present invention, the bulk polymerization and the precipitation polymerization can be used. However, in view of the performance, ease of control of the polymerization, and the absorption property of the water-absorbent agent or the water-absorbent agent composition, aqueous polymerization or the reversed-phase suspension polymerization using the foregoing monomer in the form of an aqueous solution is particularly preferable.<br>
When the aqueous solution (hereinafter referred to as "monomer aqueous solution") is used as the monomer, the concentration of the monomer in the aqueous solution is not especially limited, and may be determined depending on   the   temperature   of   the   aqueous   solution,   the   type   of   monomer,   etc.<br><br>
However, the concentration is preferably in a range from 10% by mass to 70% by mass, and further preferably in a range from 20% by mass to 60% by mass. Moreover,  when  carrying out  the  aqueous  polymerization,  a  solvent other than  water  may  be  used   together  according  to   need,   and   the   kind  of the solvent to be used together is not especially limited.<br>
Note that the reversed-phase suspension polymerization is a polymerization method in which the monomer aqueous solution is suspended in a hydrophobic organic solvent* The reversed-phase suspension polymerization is disclosed in, for example, United States Patent Nos. 4,093,776, 4,367,323, 4,446,261, 4,683,274, 5,244,735, etc. The aqueous polymerization is a method for polymerizing the monomer aqueous solution without a dispersing solvent. The aqueous polymerization is disclosed in, for example, United States Patent Nos. 4,625,001, 4,873,299, 4,286,082, 4,973,632, 4,985,518, 5,124,416, 5,250,640, 5,264,495, 5,145,906, and 5,380,808, and European Patent Nos. 0,811,636, 0,955,086, and 0,922,717. In the present invention, the above-described monomers, initiators, etc. are applicable to these polymerization methods.<br>
For initiating the polymerization, it is possible to use (i) a radical polymerization initiator, such as potassium persulfate, ammonium persulfate, sodium persulfate, t-butyl hydroperoxide, hydrogen peroxide, 2,2'-azobis (2-amidino propane) dihydrochloride and/or (ii) a photo polymerization initiator, such as 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-l-phenyl-propane- 1-one. In view of the physical property, the amount of the polymerization initiator to be used is normally from 0.001 mole% to 2 mole% (with respect to the amount of the entire monomer), and preferably 0.01 mole% to 0.1 mole%.<br>
Normally, obtained after the polymerization is a hydrous gel crosslinked polymer. According to need, this crosslinked polymer is dried, and is crushed before and/or after the drying. Thus, a water-absorbent agent is obtained. The drying is carried out in a temperature range normally from 6O°C to 25O°C, preferably from 100oC to 22O°C, and more preferably from l2OºC to 2OO°C. A drying time is determined depending on the surface area and moisture content (specified by the water content in the water-absorbent agent or the water-absorbent agent composition/measured as a degree of decrease after 3 hours drying at 180oC) of the polymer, and the type of a drying machine, so that the polymer has a desired moisture content.<br>
The moisture content of the water-absorbent agent according to the present embodiment is not particularly limited, but preferably 1 to 30 mass%, more preferably 2 to 25 mass%, further preferably 3 to 15 mass%, particularly preferably 5 to 10 mass%. If the moisture content is greater than 30 mass%, the particles lose desirable fluidity, and will not be easily handled in the subsequent processing steps. On the other hand, if the moisture content is less than 1 mass%, the production cost increases typically due to an increase in drying time.<br>
The water-absorbent agent thus produced preferably has a Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CRC; measurement method will be shown later in "Examples") of 8 g/g to 50 g/g, more preferably 10 g/g to 50 g/g, further preferably 20 g/g to 40 g/g, and most preferably 25 g/g to 35 g/g. The properties of the water-absorbent agent including CRC may be modified according to circumstances, but a CRC of less than 8 g/g or that greater than 50 g/g does not ensure the properties/effects of the water-absorbent.<br><br>
As described, the water-absorbent agent according to the present embodiment is manufactured through a step of producing a crosslinked polymer by carrying out crosslinking polymerization of an unsaturated monomer aqueous solution containing acid-group-containing un saturated monomer as a main component in the presence of an internal crosslinking agent, and a step of drying the crosslinked polymer, adjusting the size of particles and carrying out another crosslinking with respect to the vicinity of the surface of each particle of the crosslinked polymer.<br>
The particle size of the water-absorbent agent, which is defined by mass average particle diameter (D5O), logarithm standard deviation (o£), and ratio of particles less than 150 µm in particle diameter, may be adjusted by classification after completing the water-absorbent agent composition, and therefore is not particularly limited. However, for ease of processing after completing the water-absorbent agent composition, the average particle size<br>
(D5O)  is preferably set to 200 µm to  500   µ m,  more preferably 200   µ m to<br>
450 µm, further preferably 220 µm to 450 µm, still further preferably 250 µm to 430 µm, particularly preferably 300 µm to 400 µm.<br>
Further,  the  content  of particles  300   µ m  to  600   µ m  in  particle  diameter<br>
with respect to the whole amount of water-absorbent agent particles is preferably 30 mass % or more, more preferably 40 mass % or more, further preferably 50 mass % or more, particularly preferably 60 mass % or more.<br>
To adjust the particle size of the water-absorbent agent produced by reverse-phase suspension polymerization within the foregoing range, the particles may be subjected to dispersion polymerization or dispersion drying.<br>
When carrying out aqueous solution polymerization, the particle size may be adjusted by pulverization and classification after drying. In this case, the mass average particle diameter D5O and the ratio of particles less than 150 µm in diameter are controlled so that the particles have a specific size distribution. For example, in the case of adjusting particle size by reducing the mass average particle diameter D5O to be less than 450 µm, and reducing the amount of particles less than 150 µm in diameter, the particles resulted from pulverization are classified by a general classifying device such as a sieve or the like so as to remove coarse particles and fine particles. In this case, the coarse particles to be removed preferably have a particle diameter of 500 µm to 5000 µm, more preferably 450 µm to 5000 µm, further preferably 450 µm to 2000 µm, particularly preferably 45Oµm to 1000 µm. Further, the fine particles to be removed preferably have a particle diameter less than 200 µm, more preferably less than 150 µm.<br>
The coarse particles thus removed may be discarded, but most of the cases they are pulverized again for recycle. The fine particles thus removed may be discarded, but preferably to be aggregated again (described later) to increase yield.<br>
The water-absorbent agent particles thus produced through pulverization and specific adjustment of particle size distribution have irregular pulverized shapes.<br>
The    fine    particles    removed    by    the    particle    size    adjustment    through<br><br>
pulverization/classification aggregate again to be larger particles or a particle agglomeration, so as to be recycled into the water-absorbent agent of the present embodiment. The conventional method of agglomerating the fine particles by kneading them with an aqueous solution, which method is disclosed, for example, in US patent No. 6228930, No. 5264495, No. 4950692, No, 5478879 and EP patent 844270, may be used for agglomerating the fine particles to be larger particles or a particle agglomeration, so as to recycle the fine particles into the water-absorbent agent of the present embodiment. The water-absorbent agent reproduced by this method has a porous structure.<br>
The content of particles reproduced from the coarse particles or the fine particles in the water-absorbent agent of the present embodiment is preferably 0 to 50 mass %, more preferably 5 to 40 mass %, most preferably 10 to 30 mass%.<br>
In comparison with the primary particles of the water-absorbent agent of the<br>
present invention, the surface area of a given particle of the reproduced<br>
particles is larger than that of a particle identical in particle diameter of the<br>
primary particles. That is, the reproduced particle ensures a higher<br>
absorption      speed     and     therefore      superior     in      performance.	The<br>
water-absorbent agent reproduced by agglomeration of fine particles is generally mixed with the water-absorbent agent resulted from the drying process before the water-absorbent agent is adjusted in particle size through pulverization/classification.<br>
Moreover, a logarithm standard deviation (a$) of particle size distribution of the water-absorbent agent according to the present embodiment is preferably 0.25 to 0.45, more preferably 0.25 to 0.43, further preferably 0,25 to 0.40, particularly preferably 0.26 to 0.38. The smaller the logarithm standard deviation (o£) of the particle size distribution is, the narrower the particle size distribution is. However, in the present invention, it is important that the particle size distribution of the water-absorbent agent composition is not only narrow, but also spread to a certain extent. If the logarithm standard deviation (o£) is less than 0.25, the productivity greatly decreases due to decrease in yield or increase in number of recycling steps. On the other hand, if the logarithm standard deviation (o£) is more than 0.40, the particle size distribution is too large, and the desired performance may not be obtained.<br>
The ratio of particles less than 150 µm in particle diameter is preferably not more than 5 mass%, more preferably 0 to 4.5 mass%, further preferably 0 to 40. mass%, still further preferably 0 to 3.5 mass %. The ratio of particles equal to or greater than 850 µm in particle diameter is preferably not more than 5 mass%, more preferably 0 to 4,5 mass %, further preferably 0 to 4,0 mass%, still further preferably 0 to 3.5. mass%, particularly preferably 0 to 3.5 mass %. In the present invention, it is particularly preferred to meet both of the specific ranges for the ratio of particles less than 150 µm in particle diameter and for the ratio of particles equal to or greater than 850 µm in particle diameter.<br>
Note that " the whole " used here means the entire part of the<br>
water-absorbent agent.	Note also  that  "   a particle less than   150 µm in<br><br>
diameter"      in   the   present   specification   indicates   a   particle   which   passed<br>
through a sieve with 150 µm meshes in the classification using a JIS standard sieve (described later). Further, **a particle equal to or greater than 150 µm in diameter* indicates a particle remained on the sieve with 150 µm meshes in the same classification. This is applied for other sizes of sieve, Further, when 50% by mass of particles pass through a sieve with 150 µm meshes, the mass average particle diameter (D5O) of the particles is regarded 150 µm.<br>
The water-absorbent agent used for the water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably produced by further carrying out surface cros slinking (secondary cross-linking) with respect to the particles having been subjected to crosslinking polymerization and dried. The water-absorbent agent of the present invention is however not limited to this.<br>
There are various surface cross-linking agents for carrying out the surface cross-linking. However, in view of the physical property, generally used are a polyalcohol compound, an epoxy compound, a polyamine compound, a condensate of a polyamine compound and an haloepoxy compound, an oxazoline compound, a monooxazolidinone compound, a dioxazolidinone compound, a polyoxazolidinone compound, a poly metal salt, an alkylene carbonate compound, oxetane compound, cyclic urea compound etc.<br>
Specific examples of the surface cross-linking agent are surface cross-linking<br>
agents disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,228,930, 6,071,976,<br>
6,254,990, etc. The examples are: a polyalcohol compound, such as<br>

Among these cross-linking agents, it is preferable to use at least one selected from at least the oxetane compound (US2002/72,471), the cyclic urea compound, and the polyalcohol. It is more preferable to use at least one selected from an oxetane compound having 2 to 10 carbons and polyalcohol having 2 to 10 carbons. It is further preferable to use polyalcohol having 3 to 8 carbons.<br>
The amount of the surface cross-linking agent is determined depending on the types of compounds or how the compounds are combined; however the amount is preferably falls within 0.001 parts by mass to 10 parts by mass, more preferably 0.01 parts by mass to 5 parts by mass, with respect to 100 parts by mass of water-absorbent agent.<br><br>
Water may be used for the surface crosslinking. In this case, the amount of water is determined depending on the moisture content of the water-absorbent agent. However, the amount of water is preferably in a range from 0.5 part by mass to 20 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the water-absorbent agent, more preferably from 0.5 part by mass to 10 parts by mass. Further, other hydrophilic organic solvent than water may be used in the present invention. The hydrophilic organic solvent is in a range from preferably 0 part by mass to 10 parts by mass, more preferably from 0 part by mass to 5 parts by mass, further preferably from 0 part by mass to 3 parts by mass, with respect to 100 parts by mass of the water-absorbent agent.<br>
Further, among various mixing methods, it is preferable to use a method for (i) mixing the surface cross-linking agent with water and/or the hydrophilic organic solvent in advance according to need, and then (ii) spraying or dropping the resulting aqueous solution to the water-absorbent resin, and more preferably spraying the resulting solution to the water-absorbent agent. The average particle diameter of the droplets to be sprayed is preferably from 1 µm to 300 µm, and more preferably from 10 µm to 200 µm. In the process of mixture, a water-insoluble fine particle powder and/or a surfactant may coexist to an extent where the effect of the present invention is ensured.<br>
The water-absorbent resin having been mixed with the cross-linking agent is preferably subjected to a heat treatment. The heating temperature (defined by a heat medium temperature) is preferably from 100oC to 25O°C, more preferably from l5OºC to 25O°C. The heating time is preferably in a range from 1 minute to 2 hours. Preferred examples of a combination of the temperature and time are a combination of l8OºC and 0.1 hour to 1.5 hours and a combination of 2OO°C and 0.1 hour to 1 hour.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable to carry out crosslinking of the water-absorbent agent using a tervalent polycation or polycation of a greater valency in addition to the surface crosskining agent* With the tervalent polycation or polycation of a greater valency on its particle surface, the water-absorbent agent of the present invention will have further superior liquid permeability when serving as a water-absorbent agent composition.<br>
The tervalent polycation or polycation of a greater valency is selected from polymer polyamine or multivalent metal. The polymer polyamine is an amine compound containing three or more cationic groups in a molecule. The tervalent polycation or polycation of a greater valency is preferably water soluble. "Water-soluble" here means that at least O.5g, more preferably at least lg is dissolved with respect to lOOg of water at 25°C. Further, "Water-insoluble" means that 0 to O.5g is dissolved with respect to lOOg of water at 25°C.<br>
Examples of the tervalent polycation or polycation of a greater valency include a cationic polymer such as diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, poly amide polyamine, polyethylene imine, polyallylamine, polyvinylamine, or multivalent metal salts. The weight-average molecular amount of the cationic polymer is preferably in a range from 1000 to 1 million, more preferably 10000 to 500000.     The usage amount is preferably in a range of 0 to 10 parts by mass,<br><br>
preferably 0.001 to 8 parts by mass, more preferably 0.01 to 5 parts by mass.<br>
The tervalent metal or metal of a greater valency is not limited, but a tervalent metal or a quadrant metal is particularly preferable. An example is a type of metal atom selected from a group consisting of Al, Fe, Ti, Hf, Zr and other transition metals. Among these, further preferably is a type of metal atom selected from a group consisting of Al, Fe, Ti, Hf, Zr, which have a strong coupling property with respect to a carboxylic group. Particularly preferable are Al and Zr.<br>
The water-absorbent agent of the present invention preferably contains the tervalent metal or metal of a greater valency in an amount of 0.01 to 10 mass %, more preferably 0*1 to 5,0 mass%, further preferably 0,2 to 2.0 mass %.<br>
The tervalent metal or metal of a greater valency is not limited when serving as a water soluble compound. However, particularly preferred as a counter anion is an inorganic compound containing OH-, CO32', or SO42", an organic acid such as acetic acid or propionic acid, and at least one type of compound selected from a halogen group* Examples of compound include aluminum sulfate (including hydrate), potassium aluminum sulfate, sodium aluminum sulfate, aluminum hydroxide, acetylacetone zirconium complex, zirconium acetate, propionic acid zirconium, zirconium sulfate, hexafluoro potassium zirconium, hexafluoro sodium zirconium, zirconium ammonium carbonate, zirconium potassium carbonate, and sodium zirconium carbonate. Among these, a water soluble compound is particularly preferable.<br>
The tervalent metal or metal of a greater valency may be added before or after the surface crosslinking of the water-absorbent agent, or at the time of surface crosslinking. However, at the time of surface crosslinking or after the surface crosslinking are more desirable. After the surface crosslinking is most desirable.<br>
The tervalent metal or metal of a greater valency to be added may have powder (fine particles) form or may be slurry (the particles are dispersed in water or organic solvent). However, the multivalent metal is preferably used in the form of multivalent metal solution in which the multivalent metal is dissolved in a solution in which water and organic solvent are mixed. The organic solvent is not limited, but monohydric alcohol such as isopropyl alcohol; multivalent alcohol such as propylene glycol, or glycerine; organic acid such as acetic acid or lactic acid; and organic solvent easily mixed with water such as acetone or tetrahydrofuran are particularly preferable. Further, the multivalent metal solution may contain a tervalent metal compound or of less valency, such as sodium hydrate, sodium carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide etc.<br>
After  the   surface   crosslinking,   the   SFC   (Saline   Flow   Conductivity)   of the water-absorbent agent is preferably not less than 30 (Unit:   lO^cm^s^g1). The SFC denotes a liquid transmittance of the swollen water-absorbent agent. A  greater  SFC  denotes  a  higher liquid  transmittance.      The  measurement method for SFC will be specifically described later in "Examples".<br>
The SFC of the water-absorbent agent is more preferably not less than<br><br>
40 (Unit: lO-^cm^s&gt;<g-1 further preferably not less than lo-7xcm3 still lo-7 most></g-1>
If the SFC of the water-absorbent agent is less than 30 (Unit: 10-7&gt;<cm3xsxg i liquid diffusion and absorbency of the resulting water-absorbent composition under a load such as body weight decreases. result when agent is used an absorber absorptive article paper diaper does not diffuse into which results in blocking liquid. product causes problem leakage or skin trouble.></cm3xsxg>
The upper limit of SFC is not particularly limited, but the effect of the present invention is fully ensured with a SFC of around 1000 or 2000 (Unit: 10-7xcm3*sxg-i).     A larger SFC may result in an increase in production cost.<br>
Further, the Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CRC) of the water-absorbent agent after the surface crosslinking is preferably 10 to 4Og/g, more preferably 15 to 35g/g, further preferably 18 to 33g/g, particularly preferably 20 to 3Og/g. If the CRC falls below the lower limit, a large amount of water-absorbent agent is required for making a sanitary product such as paper diaper to ensure a desired absorbing property. On the other hand, if the CRC exceeds the upper limit, the gel strength decreases, and the SFC of the water-absorbent agent may fall outside the desirable range. An excessively high/low CRC is therefore not preferred.<br>
(2) Water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles<br>
In order to ensure a high liquid diffusion velocity (LDV), the water-absorbent<br>
agent composition of the present embodiment contains water-in soluble<br>
organic/inorganic particles. Preferable examples of water-insoluble organic<br>
particles include spherical mono-particles such as polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene, polystyrene, poly butadiene, polyacrylate, polymethacrylate,<br>
polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl ether, thermoplastic polyester, polycarbonate,<br>
polyphenyleneoxide,	polyepoxy,	polyacetal,	cellulose	derivative,<br>
polyacrylonitrile, polyamide, thermoplastic polyurethane, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, fluorocarbon polymer, polysulfone; and their derivatives.<br>
Preferable examples of water-insoluble inorganic particles include a metal oxide such as silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, iron oxide, titanium oxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, tin oxide, or cerium oxide.; silicic acids (salts), such as natural zeolite or synthetic zeolite; kaolin; talc; clay; and bentonite,<br>
Among these, water-insoluble inorganic particles are particularly preferable. More preferable is at least one kind selected from a group consisting of silicon dioxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, tin oxide, and cerium oxide. Further preferable is at least one kind selected from a group consisting of silicon dioxide, titanium oxide, zirconium oxide, and tin oxide, and still further preferable is amorphous silicon dioxide. It is allowable to use two or more kinds of them, and they may be combined as a composite.<br><br>
The water-insoluble organic /inorganic particles are preferably hydrophilic. More specifically, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles easily attract an aqueous solution so that the mixture of them has a suspension state (or the mixture becomes an even solution like a colloid solution).<br>
The average particle diameter of the water-in soluble organic/inorganic<br>
particles is not particularly limited, but is preferably 1 to lOOnm, more<br>
preferably 1 to 8Onm, further preferably 5 to 6Onm, particularly preferably<br>
10 to 5Onm. By ensuring this range of particle diameter, it is possible to<br>
suppress enlargement of gaps between the particles of the water-absorbent<br>
agent composition after adding the water-in soluble organic/inorganic<br>
particles.	With    this    effect,     the    liquid    updrawing    property    of    the<br>
water-absorbent agent composition is not likely to decrease.<br>
The average particle diameter of the water-in soluble organic/inorganic particles may be measured by one of the conventional methods. For example, one method may be that respective maximum and minimum diameters of 100 or more particles are measured by using &gt;
Another method may be measurement using a scattering-type particle distribution measurement device using the dynamic light scattering method or the laser diffraction method. In the case of using commercially-available particles, the mean diameter may be found in the catalog.<br>
The average particle diameter is preferably close to the diameter of a primary particle of the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles.<br>
In the case of using solid particles of water-in soluble organic/inorganic particles, the organic/inorganic particles and the water-absorbent agent may be mixed by a dry-blending method in which the particles are directly mixed or by a wet-blending method. However, if the particles are directly mixed, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles and the water-absorbent agent may not be evenly mixed. Further, the adhesion/coupling between the water-in soluble organic/ inorganic particles and the water-absorbent agent may not be sufficient. If the water-absorbent agent composition with such an inadequacy was used for an absorber of the absorptive article such as paper diaper, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles may be separated or unevenly dispersed. The resulting absorptive article therefore may not ensure certain performance.<br>
The foregoing defect is also seen as a great difference between the LDV (Liquid Diffusion Velocity) value for the bulk of water-absorbent agent composition (before classification) and that for water-absorbent agent composition classified into particles of 500 to 300 µm. The occurrence of the defect can be found by a liquid diffusion velocity (LDV) resistance test, which is suggested in the present embodiment for the first time. The liquid diffusion velocity (LDV) resistance test is described later in "Examples".<br>
For this reason, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles are preferably processed into a slurry 0.1 to 5Omass % in solid content to be mixed with the water-absorbent agent.     The solid content is more preferably<br><br>
1 to 50 mass %, further preferably 5 to 45 mass%, and still further<br>
preferably     10     to    45     mass%.	By    thus     mixing    the     slurry    of    the<br>
water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles with the water-absorbent agent,<br>
the particles to be mixed with the water-absorbent agent have the diameters<br>
close to the primary particle diameter. In preparing evenly-dispersed<br>
particles (such as the slurry, a suspension solution or a colloid solution) of<br>
the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles, a dispersion agent or a<br>
stabilization    agent    may   be    used.	Examples    of   dispersion    agent   or<br>
stabilization agent include surfactant, alkaline compound such as ammonia, sodium hydrate; acidic compound such as nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or acetic acid; polyacrylic acid, and its ammonium salt, sodium salt, or potassium salt; organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol mono n-propylether, or dimethylacetamide may be used. The amount of the dispersion agent or the stabilization agent is 5 mass % or less, preferably 3 mass % or less, more preferably 1 mass % or less, with respect to the whole amount of the solution.<br>
The amount of the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles to be added to the water-absorbent agent is preferably 0.01 to 10 parts by mass, more preferably 0.05 to 5 parts by mass, further preferably 0.1 to 3 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of water-absorbent agent composition. If the amount of the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles is greater than 10 parts by mass, the liquid updrawing speed (liquid diffusion velocity) of the water-absorbent agent composition decreases, which may results in unstable performance when the water-absorbent agent composition is used for an absorptive article such as paper diaper. On the other hand, if the amount of the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles is less than 0.01 parts by mass, the resulting water-absorbent agent will not have a desirable LDV.<br>
The dispersion solvent used for the slurry is not limited, and may be water,<br>
electrolyte aqueous solution, organic solvent or the aqueous solution thereof.<br>
Further, commercially-available colloidal silica, colloidal alumina, or<br>
colloidal titania may be preferably used for the slurry, in which case the<br>
particles very close to the primary particles are dispersed.	Note     that,     in<br>
the case where the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles are solid<br>
particles, the average particle diameter may be greater because of<br>
agglomeration of particles. Generally, it is difficult to bring the dispersion<br>
state of the solid particles in water or the like to be close to the dispersion<br>
state of the primary particles. For example, in the case of hydrophilic silica,<br>
the particles easily aggregate due to hydrogen bond between the plural<br>
silanol groups on the surface of particle, and the aggregated particles will<br>
not be easily separated to be particles again. In this case, the particle<br>
diameter may fall outside the range of average particle diameter of the<br>
water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles even when the solid particles are<br>
dispersed    in    a     solvent.	This    may    interfere    production     of    proper<br>
water-absorbent agent of the present invention. Therefore, as described above, by mixing the slurry of the water-insoluble organic/inorganic particles with the water-absorbent agent, the particles to be mixed with the water-absorbent agent maintain the diameters close to the primary particle diameter.<br>
The water-absorbent agent having been mixed with the water-insoluble organic/inorganic   particles   is   preferably   subjected   to   a   heat   treatment.<br><br>
When carrying out the heat treatment, a heating temperature (defined by a heat medium temperature) is preferably from 6O°C to l2OºC, more preferably from 7O°C to lOOºC, and a heating time is preferably in a range from 1 minute to 2 hours. Preferred examples of a combination of the temperature and time are a combination of 6O°C and 0.1 hour to 1.5 hours and a combination of 8O°C and 0*1 hour to 1 hour. If the heating condition does not meet the foregoing ranges, for example, if it is carried out under a greater temperature than l2OºC or for more than 2 hours, the hydrophilic property of the particles may be lost.<br>
As described, the water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention contains the water-insoluble organic /inorganic particles substantially equal in diameter to the primary particles. With this arrangement, it is possible to increase the liquid diffusion velocity (LDV) and the hydrophilic property of the surface of the water-absorbent agent composition without decreasing the liquid updrawing property.<br>
(3) Water-absorbent Agent Composition<br>
A water-absorbent agent composition of the present embodiment can be manufactured by (i) adding the above water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles (preferably, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles having the hydrophilic property) to the above water-absorbent agent and (ii) mixing them.<br>
That is, a method for manufacturing the water-absorbent agent composition of the present embodiment includes the steps of (I) producing a crosslinked polymer by carrying out, in the presence of an internal crosslinking agent, crosslinking polymerization of an unsaturated monomer aqueous solution containing a monomer whose main component is acrylic acid and/or its salt, (II) producing a water-absorbent agent, having the saline flow conductivity (SFC) of 30 (more preferably 40) (Unit: lO-^cm3xsxg-i), by drying the crosslinked polymer, adjusting the size of particles of the crosslinked polymer and carrying out surface crosslinking with respect to the vicinity of the surface of each particle of the crosslinked polymer, and (III) adding water-insoluble organic /inorganic fine particles, the average particle diameter of which is 1 nm to 100 nm, to the water-absorbent agent and mixing them* Moreover, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles added as above is a 0.1 to 50 mass % solids slurry (or in a dispersion state or in a colloid solution state).<br>
According to the above method, the water-in soluble organic/inorganic fine particles are more dispersed when they are mixed with the water-absorbent agent compared with the case where the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles that are solids are mixed with the water-absorbent agent. Since the water-insoluble organic /inorganic fine particles whose particle diameters are small are put in the water-absorbent agent, they hardly widen the gaps between the particles of the water-absorbent agent. Therefore, it is possible to improve the hydrophilic property of the surface of the water-absorbent agent without deteriorating the capillary force of the water-absorbent agent. On this account, it is possible to improve the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition.<br>
Moreover, liquid, such as water, is added to the water-absorbent agent at the<br><br>
same time the water-in soluble organic/inorganic fine particles are added. On this account, polymer molecules of the water-absorbent agent are slightly swollen, and the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles are put in the water-absorbent agent with the polymer network open. Therefore, part of the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles slightly enter into the water-absorbent agent from the surface thereof, Thus, the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles hardly separate from the water-absorbent agent. Therefore, the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition hardly deteriorates even with environmental changes due to inappropriate storage or process damages at a manufacturer of sanitary materials (eg. diaper) using the water-absorbent agent as a material.<br>
Moreover, since the water-absorbent agent is subjected to the surface crosslinking, it has excellent liquid permeability. Therefore, according to the above method, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbent agent composition (i) which has both the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property that are conventionally incompatible with each other, and (ii) whose liquid updrawing property hardly deteriorates.<br>
Moreover, it is more preferable that the water-absorbent agent have a specific particle size. That is, it is more preferable that a method for manufacturing a water-absorbent agent composition of the present embodiment include the steps of (I) producing a crosslinked polymer by carrying out, in the presence of an internal crosslinking agent, crosslinking polymerization of an unsaturated monomer aqueous solution containing a monomer whose main component is acrylic acid and/or its salt, (II) producing a water-absorbent agent by drying the crosslinked polymer, adjusting the size of particles of the crosslinked polymer and carrying out crosslinking with respect to the vicinity of the surface of each particle of the crosslinked polymer, the water-absorbent agent satisfying conditions (i) to (iv) below,<br>
(i) mass average particle diameter (D5O) is 200 µm to 500 µm (more preferably 200 to 450 µm)<br>
(ii) percentage of particles less than 150 µm in diameter is not more than 5 mass % with respect to the whole particle amount<br>
(iii) logarithm standard deviation (o£) of particle size distribution is 0.25 to 0.45<br>
(iv) saline flow conductivity (SFC) is not less than 30 (more preferably<br>
40) (Unit; 10-7*cm3xsxg-i)<br>
, and (III) adding water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles, the average particle diameter of which is 1 nm to 100 nm, to the water-absorbent agent and mixing them, and the water-insoluble organic/inorganic fine particles be a 0.1 to 50 mass % solids slurry.<br>
Since the water-absorbent agent has the above particle size distribution, it becomes easy to adjust the particle size of the water-absorbent agent composition.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present embodiment contains as a main component a polycarboxylic acid water-absorbent agent having a crosslinking structure which is produced by polymerizing an acid-group-containing unsaturated monomer, the water-absorbent agent composition   containing  water-insoluble  organic   or  inorganic   fine  particles,<br><br>
the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the foregoing set of preferable conditions (a) through (e), or another set of preferable conditions (a') through [d'). With these features, water-absorbent agent composition according to the present embodiment is highly accurately adjusted in gap size between the particles, and therefore is superior in liquid permeability and liquid updrawing property.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition of the present embodiment is adjusted to have a specific particle size so as to obtain both the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property. The average mass particle diameter (D5O) according to the condition (c) above of the water-absorbent agent composition is in a range from 200 µm to 420 µm, more preferably in a range from 220 µm to 420 µm, further preferably in a range from 250 µm to 420 µm, and especially preferably in a range from 300 µm to 420 µm.<br>
Moreover, the logarithm standard deviation (o£) of the particle size distribution according to the condition (d) above is in a range from 0.25 to 0.40, more preferably in a range from 0.25 to 0.39, further preferably in a range from 0.25 to 0*38, and most preferably in a range from 0.28 to 0.35. The smaller the logarithm standard deviation (o£) of the particle size distribution is, the narrower the particle size distribution is. However, in the present embodiment, it is important that the particle size distribution of the water-absorbent agent composition is not only narrow, but also spread to a certain extent. If the logarithm standard deviation (o£) is less than 0.25, the productivity deteriorates significantly due to decrease in yield or increase in number of recycle steps. On the other hand, if the logarithm standard deviation (o$) is more than 0.40, the particle size distribution is too large, and the desired performance may not be obtained*<br>
Moreover, the percentage of particles less than 150 µm in diameter according to the condition (e) above is 3 mass % or less with respect to the whole particle amount, more preferably 0 mass % to 2.5 mass %, further preferably 0 mass % to 2.0 mass %, and especially preferably 0 mass % to 1.5 mass %. If the percentage of particles less than 150 µm in diameter is 3 mass % or more with respect to the whole particle amount, fine particles whose water absorption speed is high cause gel blocking, the liquid permeability deteriorates, the SFC deteriorates, a work environment deteriorates due to splashing of the fine particles. Therefore, such a high percentage is not preferable. Thus, in order to obtain both high LDV and high SFC in the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention satisfying the conditions (a) through (e), the particle size distribution is controlled highly, that is, the average particle diameter is controlled to 200 µm to 420 µm and the logarithm standard deviation (o£) of the particle size distribution is controlled to 0.25 to 0.40. On this account, it is necessary to reduce the percentage of particles comparatively large in particle size.<br>
Specifically, the ratio of particles equal to or greater than 850 µm in particle diameter (measured by a JIS standard sieve) is preferably not more than 3 mass%, more preferably 0 to 2*5 mass %, further preferably 0 to 2.0 mass %, particularly preferably 0 to 1.5 mass%. In the present invention, it is particularly preferred to meet both of the specific ranges for the ratio of particles less than 150 µm in particle diameter and for the ratio of particles equal to or greater than 850 µm in particle diameter.<br>
Further,  the percentage of particles each of whose diameter measured by a<br><br>
JIS standard sieve is 710 µm or larger is preferably 0 to 5 mass %, more preferably 3 mass % or less, and further preferably 1 mass % or less with respect to the whole. Note that "the whole" used here means the whole water-absorbent agent composition.<br>
Further, to ensure both of high LDV and high SFC, the content of particles 300 to 600 µm in diameter according to the condition (a') above needs to be not less than 30 mass %, more preferably not less than 40 mass %, further preferably not less than 50 mass %, particularly preferably not less than 60 mass %. Note that, the upper limit of the content of particles 300 to 600 µm in diameter is 100 mass %, however the upper limit is preferably not more than 90 mass %, more preferably not more than 80% in terms of productivity.<br>
The average gap radius index under no pressure according to the condition (b*) above is less than 310 µm, preferably less than 300 µm, more preferably less than 280 µm, further preferably less than 250 µm, particularly preferably less than 200 µm. If the average gap radius index under no pressure exceeds 310 µm, the liquid updrawing property significantly decreases due to decrease of capillary force. This causes decrease in performance of diaper constituted of the water-absorbent agent composition, Note that, the lower limit of average gap radius index under no pressure is not particularly limited.     The lower limit is however preferably 30 µm.<br>
The shape of the particle of the water-absorbent agent composition is not<br>
limited to a spherical shape, a crushed shape, an indeterminate shape, etc.,<br>
but preferably used is an irregular pulverized shape obtained by<br>
pulverization. Further, in view of a balance between the liquid permeability<br>
and the liquid updrawing property, the bulk specific gravity (defined by JIS<br>
K-3362 : 1998) of the water-absorbent agent composition is preferably in a<br>
range from 0.40 g/ml to 0.80 g/ml, more preferably in a range from 0.50<br>
g/ml to 0.75 g/ml, and further preferably in a range from 0.60 g/ml to 0.73<br>
g/ml.	Note that adjustment of the particle  size may be carried out by<br>
polymerization, gel pulverization (Other name: gel fragmentation), drying, pulverization, classification, granulation, mixing of plural kinds of particles of the water-absorbent agent(s) and/or particles of the water-absorbent agent composition(s), etc.<br>
In the water-absorbent agent composition of the present embodiment, the decreasing rate of the liquid distribution velocity (LDV) according to the condition (a) above is not more than 30%, Note that, the lower limit of the LDV decreasing rate may be a negative value. The lower limit is generally -10%, and more preferably 0%. The decreasing rate of the LDV is an index for measuring the impact resistance of the liquid distribution velocity of the water-absorbent agent composition, and is calculated as the decreasing rate of the LDV before/after the LDV resistance test by the following formula.<br>
Decreasing Rate of LDV (%) = {(LDV i - LDV 2) / LDV x) * 100<br>
In this formula, LDV i denotes the LDV (mm/s) before the LDV resistance test, and LDV 2 denotes the LDV (mm/s) after the LDV resistance test.<br>
The LDV is a parameter which shows the liquid updrawing property and can  be  obtained   by  a  measurement   method  explained  in  Examples  below.<br><br>
The LDV can be calculated by the following formula. LDV (mm/s) = lOO(mm) / WR (s)<br>
In this formula, WR denotes the liquid updrawing speed, A test method of the WR (Wicking Rate) will be described in details in Examples below.<br>
In terms of improving performances of absorbent articles such as paper diapers and sanitary napkins, the LDV relates to a velocity of liquid diffusing mainly in an absorber of an absorbent article, and particularly to an initial velocity of liquid to be absorbed.<br>
Note that the LDV resistance test is a test carried out by putting the water-absorbent agent composition in a predetermined vessel and then vibrating the vessel for a certain time. Details of a method of this test will be explained in Examples below.<br>
The decreasing rate of the LDV of the water-absorbent agent composition<br>
according to the condition (a) above is more preferably 25% or less, further<br>
preferably 20% or less, and especially preferably 15% or less.	If	the<br>
decreasing rate of the LDV is 30% or less, the LDV of the water-absorbent agent composition hardly deteriorates due to mechanical damages (process damages) or with time. Therefore, even after the water-absorbent agent composition is applied to an absorbent article, the liquid updrawing property can be maintained for a long time satisfactorily.<br>
Moreover, the LDV of the water-absorbent agent composition according to the present embodiment (the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the conditions (a) through (e), and the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the conditions (a') through (d')) after the LDV resistance test is preferably 1.3 mm/s or more, more preferably 1,5 mm/s or more, further preferably 1.7 mm/s or more, and especially preferably 2.0 mm/s or more, particularly preferably 2.5 mm or more. If the water-absorbent agent composition whose LDV after the LDV resistance test is less than 1.3 mm/s is used as an absorber of an absorbent article such as a paper diaper and a sanitary napkin, liquid is not absorbed by the absorbent article attached along a hip in practical use. Therefore, the water-absorbent agent composition is unsuitable for practical use.<br>
Moreover, the LDV of the water-absorbent agent composition according to the condition (c') above before the LDV resistance test is 2.0 mm/s or more, preferably 2.1 mm/s or more, preferably 2.2 mm/s or more, further preferably 2.3 mm/s or more, particularly preferably 2.5mm/s. The LDV of the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the conditions (a) through (e) before the LDV resistance test is preferably 2.0 mm/s or more, more preferably 2.1 mm/s or more, further preferably 2.2 mm/s or more, still further preferably 2.3 mm/s or more, particularly preferably 2.5mm/s or more.<br>
If the water-absorbent agent composition whose LDV before the LDV resistance test is less than 2.0 mm/s is used as an absorber of an absorbent article such as a paper diaper and a sanitary napkins, it may not be possible to secure the liquid updrawing property, which is necessary for the absorbent articles, because of the deterioration of the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition due to process damages in<br><br>
manufacturing steps of the absorbent article, changes with time, etc. Note that, the upper limit of LDV is not particularly limited, but a LDV of about lOmm/s is generally sufficient.<br>
The SFC of the water-absorbent agent composition according to the condition (b) above is 60 (Unit: 10-7cm3-s/g) or more, preferably 70 (Unit: 10-7cm3•s/g) or more, preferably 80 (Unit: 10-7cm3-s/g) or more, and especially preferably 90 (Unit: 10-7cm3,s/g) or more.<br>
The SFC of the water-absorbent agent composition according to the condition (d*) above is 30 (Unit: 10 7cm3•s/g) or more, preferably 40 (Unit: 10-7cm3•s/g) or more, preferably 60 (Unit: 10-7cm3 ■ s/g) or more, further preferably 70 (Unit: l(l•7cm3•s/g) or more, particularly preferably 80 (Unit: 10 7cm3,s/g) or more, and most preferably 90 (Unit: 10-7cm3•s/g) or more.<br>
If the SFC is less than 30 (Unit:  10-7cm3• s/g), the liquid diffusion and liquid<br>
absorbency of the water-absorbent agent composition under a load, such as body weight, decreases. As a result, when the water-absorbent agent composition is used as an absorber of an absorbent article such as a paper diaper, the liquid does not diffuse in the absorbent article, which results in blocking of liquid. Such a diaper causes a problem of liquid leakage or skin trouble.<br>
Note that, the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the conditions (a) through (e) preferably further satisfies at least one of the conditions (a') through (d*). Similarly, the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the conditions (a') through (d') preferably further satisfies at least one of the conditions (a) through (e).<br>
Moreover, it is preferable that the water-absorbent agent composition have the capillary suction index (CSI) of 85 or more. The CSI is an index showing the capillary suction power of the water-absorbent agent composition, and can be calculated as a sum of the respective capillary suction forces (CSF) of the water-absorbent agent composition subjected to respective negative pressure gradients of 0 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 30cm. Details of a test method of the CSI will be described in Examples below.<br>
The CSI of the water-absorbent agent composition is more preferably 88 or more, further preferably 90 or more, and especially preferably 95 or more. Note that, the upper limit of CSI is not particularly limited, but the CSI is generally about 200 in the present invention.<br>
If the water-absorbent agent composition whose CSI is less than 85 is used as an absorber of an absorbent article such as a paper diaper and a sanitary napkin, the liquid absorbency is insufficient. Such absorbent article is insufficient for practical use, and especially liquid suction in a vertical direction when the absorbent article is attached is insufficient, which is not preferable.<br>
Moreover,  it is preferable that the water-absorbent agent composition have<br><br>
the absorbency against pressure (AAP) of 22 g/g or more. The AAP is an absorbency of the water-absorbent agent composition under pressure, Details of a test method of the AAP will be described in Examples below.<br>
The AAP of the water-absorbent agent composition is more preferably 23 g/g or more, further preferably 24 g/g or more, and especially preferably 25 g/g or more.     Note that, the upper limit of AAP is generally about 35 g/g.<br>
If the AAP is less than 22g/g, the liquid diffusion and liquid absorbency of the water-absorbent agent composition under a load, such as body weight, decreases. As a result, when the water-absorbent agent composition is used as an absorber of an absorbent article such as a paper diaper, the liquid does not diffuse in the absorbent article, which results in blocking of liquid. Such a diaper causes a problem of liquid leakage or skin trouble.<br>
Moreover, the centrifuge retention capacity (CRC) of the water-absorbent agent composition is preferably 10 g/g to 40 g/g, more preferably 15 g/g to 35 g/g, further preferably 18 g/g to 33 g/g, and especially preferably 20 g/g to 30 g/g. If the water-absorbent agent whose CRC of the water-absorbent agent is less than the lower limit of the above range is used in a sanitary material such as a paper diaper, the sanitary product needs a large amount of water-absorbent agents so as to obtain a desired amount of absorption. Therefore, it is not preferable that the CRC of the water-absorbent agent be less than the lower limit of the above range. Moreover, if the CRC of the water-absorbent agent is more than the upper limit of the above range, the gel strength becomes low, and it becomes difficult to obtain the water-absorbent agent whose SFC is in a desired range* Therefore, it is not preferable that the CRC of the water-absorbent agent be more than the upper limit of the above range.<br>
Moreover, the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property are conventionally incompatible with each other. However, the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has both properties which are improved in a balanced manner, and the WR is much more excellent than the AAP or the SFC.<br>
That is, the balance between the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition is expressed by a liquid suction efficiency defined by the liquid permeability/the liquid updrawing speed, that is, SFC/WR. The liquid suction efficiency (SFC/WR) of the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is preferably 0.50 to 100 (Unit: 10-7*cm3xg-i), further preferably 0.70 to 100 (Unit: lO-7*cm3xg1). and especially preferably 1.00 to 100 (Unit: 10 -7xcm3xg-1). The water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has an excellent balance between the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property, and is suitable for use as a sanitary material.<br>
Moreover, the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has an excellent balance between the centrifuge retention capacity and the liquid updrawing property, and this balance is expressed by a no pressure suction efficiency defined by the centrifuge retention capacity/the liquid updrawing speed, that is, CRC/WR. The no pressure suction efficiency (CRC/WR) of the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is  preferably  0.15   to   2   (g/g/s),   further  preferably  0.20   to   2   (g/g/s),   and<br><br>
especially preferably 0.25 to 2 (g/g/s). The water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has an excellent balance between the centrifuge retention capacity and the liquid updrawing property, and is suitable for use as a sanitary material.<br>
Moreover, the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has an excellent balance between the absorbency against pressure and the liquid updrawing property, and this balance is expressed by a pressure suction efficiency defined by the absorbency against pressure/the liquid updrawing speed, that is, AAP (g/g)/WR (s). The pressure suction efficiency (AAP/WR) of the water-absorbent agent composition is preferably 0.15 to 2 (g/g/s), further preferably 0.20 to 2 (g/g/s) or less, and especially preferably 0,25 to 2 (g/g/s). The water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has an excellent balance between the absorbency against pressure and the liquid updrawing property, and is suitable for use as a sanitary material.<br>
Moreover, the moisture content of the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is preferably 1 to 15%, more preferably 2.5% to 15 mass%, further preferably 2.5% to 13%, and most preferably 2.5% to 10%.<br>
If the moisture content is more than 15 mass %, the water absorption ratio of the water-absorbent agent composition may deteriorate. If the moisture content is less than 1 mass %, the LDV of the water-absorbent agent composition may deteriorate.<br>
The amount of water soluble components in the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is preferably 25 mass % or less (the lower limit is 0 mass %), more preferably 20 mass % or less, and further preferably 15 mass % or less.<br>
Moreover, regarding the color of the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention, a YI (Yellow Index, see European Patent Nos, 942,014 and 1,108,745) of the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is preferably 0 to 15, more preferably 0 to 13, further preferably 0 to 10, and especially preferably 0 to 5* Further, the content of remaining monomers of the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is preferably 0 ppm to 400 ppm, and more preferably 0 ppm to 300 ppm. Moreover, in a water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention and a method for manufacturing the same, deodorants, antibacterial agents, aroma chemicals, foaming agents, pigments, dyes, plasticizers, adhesives, surfactants, fertilizers, oxidizing agents, reducers, water, salts, chelating agents, disinfectants, hydrophilic polymers such as polyethylene glycol, paraffins, hydrophobic polymers, thermoplastic resins such as polyethylene and polypropylene, thermosetting resins such as polyester resin and urea resin, etc. may be added, according to need, to the water-absorbent agent and/or the water-absorbent agent composition, as far as the liquid updrawing speed (liquid distribution velocity) does not deteriorate (for example, 0 to 10 mass parts with respect to 100 mass parts of the water-absorbent agent and/or the water-absorbent agent composition). The water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has an excellent hygroscopic property or water absorbing property, and can be used in applications, such as agriculture, horticulture, cable water stop agents, civil     engineering,      architecture,      and     food     products,      in     which     the<br><br>
water-absorbent agent has been used conventionally. In addition, the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention has both the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property which are necessary physical properties for an absorber of an absorbent article, so that it can be used suitably as a fixation agent (absorption gelling agent) for urine, feces, or blood.<br>
The absorber is usually formed so as to contain the water-absorbent agent composition. In the absorber, the content (core concentration) of the water-absorbent agent composition with respect to the total weight of the water-absorbent agent composition and hydrophilic fiber is preferably 20 mass % to 100 mass %, more preferably 30 mass % to 100 mass %, further preferably 30 mass % to 90 mass %, and especially preferably 40 mass % to 80 mass %. If the core concentration is less than 20 mass %, it is difficult to utilize the characteristics of the water-absorbent agent composition.<br>
One preferable example of use of an absorber using the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention is an application to a water-absorbent complex having expansion anisotropy (expansibility in a thickness direction) disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,853,867. By using the water-absorbent agent composition, having excellent diffusibility, of the present invention, it is possible to obtain an absorber which has not only the expansibility in a thickness direction but also dramatically improved liquid diffusibility in a lateral direction (plane direction).<br>
Preferably, the absorber is formed by compression molding so as to have a density of 0.06 g/cc to 0,50 g/cc and a basic weight of 0.01 g/cm2 to 0.20 g/cm2. Note that a fibrous substrate used is hydrophilic fiber, such as fractured wood pulp, cotton linter, crosslinked cellulose fiber, rayon, cotton, sheep wool, acetate, and vinylon. Moreover, the fibrous substrate used is preferably each of their air laid products.<br>
Further, the absorbent article of the present invention is, for example, an absorbent article including the above absorber, a front face sheet having liquid transmittance, and a back face sheet having the liquid impermeability. Specific examples of the absorbent article are sanitary materials such as adult paper diapers whose market have been remarkably growing in recent years, child diapers, sanitary napkins, and so-called incontinence pads.<br>
As described, the water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention contains as a main component a polycarboxylic acid water-absorbent agent having a crosslinking structure which is produced by polymerizing an acid-group-containing unsaturated monomer, the water-absorbent agent composition containing water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles, the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the following set of conditions (a) through (e):<br>
(a)	decreasing rate  of a liquid  distribution velocity  (LDV)  is  not  more than 30%;<br>
(b)	saline  flow conductivity  (SFC)  is  not  less  than   60  (Unit:   107cm3-<br>
s/g);<br>
(c)	mass average particle diameter (D5O) is 200 to 420 µm;<br>
(d)	logarithm standard deviation (o£) of particle size distribution is 0.25 to 0.40;<br><br>
(e)  percentage 01  particles less  tnan   lb<j in diameter is not more than mass with respect to the whole particle amount.></j>
With this feature, it is possible to provide the water-absorbent agent composition (i) which has both the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property that are conventionally incompatible with each other and (ii) whose liquid updrawing property hardly deteriorates.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that a liquid distribution velocity (LDV) of the water-absorbent agent composition before a liquid distribution velocity resistance test is not less than 2.Omm/s.<br>
According to the above, since the liquid distribution velocity (LDV) of the water-absorbent agent composition immediately after its manufacturing is high, it is possible to secure the liquid updrawing property sufficiently.<br>
Further, the water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention contains as a main component a polycarboxylic acid water-absorbent agent having a crosslinking structure which is produced by polymerizing an acid-group-containing unsaturated monomer, the water-absorbent agent composition containing water-insoluble organic or inorganic fine particles, the water-absorbent agent composition satisfying the following set of conditions (a*) through (d'):<br>
(a')   content   of  particles   300   to   600   µm   in   diameter   is   not   less   than   30<br>
mass %<br>
(b') average gap radius index under no pressure is less than 310 µm<br>
(c') a liquid distribution velocity (LDV:  measured before the LDV resistance<br>
test) is not less than 2.Omm/s<br>
(d*) saline flow conductivity (SFC) is not less than 30 (Unit: lO-7cm3xsxg-1).<br>
With this feature, it is possible to provide the water-absorbent agent composition (i) which has both the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property that are conventionally incompatible with each other and (ii) whose liquid updrawing property hardly deteriorates.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that the water-in soluble organic or inorganic fine particles are hydrophilic inorganic particles.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that the hydrophilic inorganic particles are particles 1 to lOOnm in average particle diameter constituted of one or plural materials selected from a group consisting of amorphous silicon dioxide, titanium oxide, and alumina oxide.<br>
According to the above, the inorganic particle, having the hydrophilic property, which is at least one selected from a group consisting of amorphous silicon dioxide, titanium oxide, and alumina oxide has very small average particle diameter, that is, 1 nm to 100 nm. Moreover, the binding force between the primary particles of the inorganic particle is comparatively weak. Therefore, by shearing the inorganic particles, or by dispersing the inorganic particles  in a solution under specific conditions,  it is possible to<br><br>
reduce the particle diameter to a diameter close to that of the primary particle even if the inorganic particle is aggregated particles. On this account, the inorganic particles disperse well on the surface of the water-absorbent agent, and the inorganic particles, each of whose diameter is close to that of the primary particle, are put on the surface of the particle of the water-absorbent agent of the water-absorbent agent composition and in the gap between water-absorbent agent particles in the vicinity of the surface of the water-absorbent agent. Since the inorganic particles whose particle diameters are small are put in the water-absorbent agent composition, they hardly widen the gaps between particles of the water-absorbent agent of the water-absorbent agent composition. The capillary force is inversely proportional to the diameter of the gap between particles. Therefore, the water-absorbent agent composition of the present invention in which the diameter of the gap between particles of the water-absorbent agent hardly become wide can further suppress a decrease in the capillary force of the water-absorbent agent composition and improve the hydrophilic property of the surface of the water-absorbent agent composition. Therefore, it is possible to further improve the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that a liquid distribution velocity (LDV) of the water-absorbent agent composition after a liquid distribution velocity resistance test is not less than l.3mm/s.<br>
According to the above, the water-absorbent agent composition secures an adequate liquid updrawing property even if the water-absorbent agent composition is affected by environmental changes, such as storage conditions or process damages at a manufacturer of sanitary materials such as diapers using the water-absorbent agent as a material.<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that a capillary suction index (CSI) of the water-absorbent agent composition is not less than 85.<br>
According to the above, it is possible to further improve the liquid updrawing property of the water-absorbent agent composition in a vertical direction under pressure higher than that used when measuring the LDV,<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that an absorbency against pressure (AAP) of the water-absorbent agent composition is not less than 22 g/g.<br>
According to the above, since the water-absorbent agent composition has excellent liquid diffusion and liquid absorption under a load such as body weight, it is possible to prevent liquid blocking in the water-absorbent agent composition. Therefore, it is possible to provide the absorbent article which does not cause liquid leakage, skin trouble, etc* when used as an absorber of the absorbent article such as a paper diaper*<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention is preferably adjusted so that a moisture content of the water-absorbent agent composition is 1 to 15 mass % (more preferably 2.5 to 15 mass %).<br><br>
According to the above, it is possible to improve the hydrophilic property of the water-absorbent agent, and also possible to prevent (i) deterioration of a powder handling property due to high moisture content, and (ii) a decrease in the liquid distribution velocity due to low moisture content.<br>
A method for producing a water-absorbent agent composition according to the present invention comprises the step of:<br>
(a)	carrying out crosslinking polymerization of an unsaturated monomer<br>
solution constituted of a monomer containing as a main component an<br>
acrylic acid and/or its salt so as to produce a crosslinked polymer in the<br>
presence of an internal crosslinking agent,<br>
the method further comprising the steps of:<br>
(b)	drying the crosslinked polymer, adjusting the particle size of the<br>
crosslinked polymer, and carrying out another crosslinking with respect to a<br>
vicinity of the surface of each particle of the crosslinked polymer so as to<br>
obtain a water-absorbent agent which satisfy the following set of conditions<br>
(i) through (iv):<br>
(i) mass average particle diameter (D5O) is 200 to 500 µm;<br>
(ii) percentage of particles less than 150 µm in diameter is not more than 5 mass % with respect to the whole particle amount;<br>
(iii) logarithm standard deviation (o£) of particle size distribution is 0.25 to 0.45;<br>
(iv) saline flow conductivity (SFC) is not less than 30 (Unit: 10-7cm3&gt;<sxg></sxg>
and<br>
(c)	mixing the water-absorbent agent with water-insoluble organic or<br>
inorganic fine particles 1 to lOOnm in average particle diameter,<br>
wherein:<br>
the water-in soluble organic or inorganic fine particles are processed into a slurry 0*1 to 50 mass % in solid content to be mixed with the water-absorbent agent.<br>
Thus, it is possible to manufacture the water-absorbent agent composition (i) which has both the liquid permeability and the liquid updrawing property that are conventionally incompatible with each other and (ii) whose liquid updrawing property hardly decreases.<br>
[EXAMPLES]<br>
The present invention will be explained further using Examples and<br>
Comparative Examples, however the present invention is not limited to these<br>
Examples. Performances of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the<br>
water-absorbent agent) are measured by the following methods. Electric<br>
instruments in Examples are used under conditions of 200V or 100V and<br>
60Hz.	Further,    unless    otherwise    stated,    the    water-absorbent    agent<br>
composition or the water-absorbent agent is used under conditions of 25°C ± 2°C and 5O%RH. Moreover, used as a physiological saline is a 0.90 mass % sodium chloride aqueous solution.<br>
Note that, if the moisture content of the water-absorbent agent or the water-absorbent agent composition taken from diaper or the like is more than 5 mass %, the agent or the agent composition is subjected to reduced-pressure drying under lOOºC until the moisture content becomes equal   to   or   less   than   5   mass   %   before   carrying   out   the   later-described<br><br>
performance measurement.<br>
Moreover, chemicals or appliances described in the following methods and Examples may be replaced with other comparable chemicals or appliances accordingly,<br>
[Centrifuge Retention Capacity (CRC)]<br>
W (gram) (about 0.20 gram) of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) obtained in Example or Comparative Example below was uniformly put into a bag (60 mm * 85 mm, its material is compliant with EDANA ERT 441.1 -99) made of nonwoven fabric, and the bag was sealed and immersed in a 0.90 mass % physiological saline whose temperature was adjusted to 25°C ± 2°C. The bag was pulled out of the solution 30 minutes later, and the solution was drained from the bag using a centrifuge (produced by Kokusan Co., Ltd., Type H-122 small centrifuge) at 25OG (250 * 9,81 m/s2) for 3 minutes. Then, a weight W2 (gram) of the bag was measured. Moreover, the same operation was carried out without the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent). Then, a weight Wl (gram) of the bag was measured. Then, the CRC (g/g) was calculated by the following formula using the masses W, Wl and W2.<br>
CRC (g/g) = {( W2 (gram) - Wl (gram)) / W (gram)} - 1<br>
[Absorbency Against Pressure (AAP)]<br>
A stainless steel 400 mesh metal gauze (mesh size (mesh opening size) = 38 µm) was fused to the bottom of a plastic supporting cylinder having an internal diameter of 60 mm, and W (gram) (about 0,90 gram) of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) was uniformly sprinkled on this metal gauze. Then, a piston and a load were placed in this order on the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent). The piston and the load were adjusted so as to uniformly apply load of 4,83 kPa (0,7 psi) to the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent).<br>
Each of the piston and the load has an external diameter which is slightly<br>
smaller than 60 mm so that (i) there is no gap between the piston (the load)<br>
and the supporting cylinder and (ii) the vertical motions of the piston (the<br>
load) were smooth. Before placing the load, a weight W3 (gram) of this<br>
measuring device (that is, a total weight of the supporting cylinder, the<br>
water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) and the<br>
piston) was measured.	A glass filter (produced by Sogo Laboratory Glass<br>
Works Co., Ltd., Pore Diameter: 100 µm to 120 µm) having a diameter of 90 mm and a thickness of 5 mm was placed inside a petri dish having a diameter of 150 mm. Then, the 0.90 mass % physiological saline was added to the petri dish so that the liquid level of the 0.90 mass % saline solution is the same as the top surface of the glass filter. Then, a piece of filter paper (produced by Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd., ADVANTEC; No.2, JIS P 3801) having a diameter of 90 mm was placed on the glass filter, so that the surface of the filter paper got wet entirely, and excessive liquid was removed.<br>
The measuring device was placed on the wet filter paper, and the liquid was absorbed under load.     When the liquid  surface became  lower than the top<br><br>
surface of the glass filter, the liquid was added so that the liquid level was kept constant. The measuring device was lifted up an hour later, and a weight W4 (gram) (a total weight of the supporting cylinder, swollen water-absorbent agent composition (or swollen water-absorbent agent) and the piston) not including the weight of the load was measured. Then, the AAP (g/g) was calculated by the following formula using the masses W, W3 and W4.<br>
AAP (g/g) = (W4 (gram) - W3 (gram)) / W (gram)<br>
[Mass Average Particle Diameter (D5O) and Logarithm Standard Deviation (o5)]<br>
The water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) was<br>
sieved by a JIS standard sieve having a mesh size of 850 µm, 710 µm, 600<br>
µm, 500 µm, 300 µm, 150 µm, 45 µm, or the like, and a residual percentage<br>
R was plotted to a logarithmic probability sheet. Thus, a particle diameter<br>
corresponding to R = 50 mass % was considered as the mass average particle<br>
diameter    (D5O).	Moreover,    the    logarithm    standard    deviation    (o$)    is<br>
expressed by the following formula. The smaller o$ is, the narrower the particle size distribution is.<br>
ol = 0.5 x ln(X2 / XI)<br>
(where XI denotes a particle diameter when R = 84.1%, and X2 denotes a particle diameter when R - 15.9%)<br>
The classification method used when measuring the mass average particle diameter (D5O) and the logarithm standard deviation (o£) was carried out as follows. 10.0 grams of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) was put into the JIS standard sieve (THE IIDA TESTING SIEVE: Diameter of 8 cm) having a mesh size of 850 µm, 710 µm, 600 µm, 500 µm, 300 µm, 150 µm, 45 µm, or the like, under conditions of room temperature (2O°C to 25°C) and 50% RH. Then, the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) was classified by a sieve shaker (IIDA SIEVE SHAKER, TYPE: ES-65&gt; SER. No. 0501) for five minutes.<br>
[Saline Flow Conductivity (SFC)]<br>
The SFC is a value showing the liquid transmittance of the swollen water-absorbent agent, The larger the SFC is, the higher the liquid transmittance is*<br>
The following was carried out in accordance with a saline flow conductivity (SFC) test disclosed in a published Japanese translation of PCT international publication for patent application No. 9-509591 (Tokuhyohei 9-509591).<br>
The following will explain an apparatus used for the SFC test in reference to Figure 1.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, a glass tube 32 was inserted into a tank 31, and the lower end of the glass tube 32 was located so that the liquid level of a 0.69 mass % physiological saline 33 was maintained to be 5 cm above the bottom of a swollen gel 37 in a cell 39. The 0,69 mass % physiological saline 33 in the tank 31 was supplied to the cell 39 through an L-shaped tube 34 having a cock.     A vessel 48 for collecting the liquid having passed through the cell<br><br>
39 was placed under the cell 39, and this vessel 48 was placed on an even balance 49. The internal diameter of the cell 39 was 6 cm, and a No.400 stainless steel metal gauze (mesh size 38 µm) 38 was provided at the bottom of the cell 39. An opening 47 allowing the liquid to pass through was formed at a lower portion of a piston 46, and a glass filter 45 having excellent permeability was provided at a bottom of the piston 46 so that the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) or the swollen gel does not get into the opening 47. The cell 39 was placed on a base for mounting the cell 39, and a stainless steel metal gauze which does not disturb the passing of the liquid was placed on a surface of the base, the surface being in contact with the cell 39.<br>
Using the apparatus shown in Figure 1, the water-absorbent agent (0.900 gram) uniformly put into a vessel 40 swelled in artificial urine under pressure of 2.07 kPa (about 0.3 psi) for 60 minutes, and then, the height of a gel layer of the gel 37 was recorded. Next, the 0.69 mass % physiological saline 33 was supplied from the tank 31 at a certain hydrostatic pressure so as to pass through the swollen gel layer under pressure of 2,07 kPa (about 0.3 psi). This SFC test was carried out at room temperature (25°C ± 2°C), Using a computer and the even balance 49, the amount of liquid passing through the gel layer was recorded every 20 seconds for 10 minutes as a function of time. A flow speed Fs (T) of the liquid passing through (mainly between the particles of) the swollen gel 37 was determined by dividing an increased weight (gram) by an increased time (s) and expressed by g/s. A time the hydrostatic pressure became constant and the flow speed became stable was Ts, Data obtained in 10 minutes from Ts was used for calculating the flow speed. Then, the value of Fs (T = 0), that is, an initial flow speed of the liquid passing through the gel layer was calculated using the flow speed.     Fs (T = 0) was extrapolated from a result of a least square<br>
method of Fs (T) versus time.     Note that the unit of the SFC is (10 7,cm3,s•<br>
SFC = (Fs (t = 0) x L0) / (p x A x AP) = (Fs (t - 0) x L0) /  139506<br>
In this formula, Fs (t = 0) denotes the flow speed shown by g/s, L0 denotes the height of the gel layer shown by cm, p denotes the density of a NaCl solution (1.003 g/cm3), A denotes the area of an upper surface of the gel layer in the cell 39 (28.27 cm2), and AP denotes the hydrostatic pressure applied to the gel layer (4,920 dyne/cm2).<br>
Note that the artificial urine used in the SFC test is a mixture of 0.25 gram of calcium chloride dihydrate, 2.0 grams of potassium chloride, 0,50 gram of magnesium chloride hexahydrate, 2,0 grams of sodium sulfate, 0.85 gram of ammonium dihydrogen phosphate, 0.15 gram of diammonium hydrogenphosphate and 994.25 grams of purified water.<br>
[Capillary Suction Index (CSI)]<br>
The CSI is an index showing the capillary suction power of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent), and can be calculated as a sum of the respective capillary suction forces (CSF) of the water-absorbent agent composition subjected to respective negative pressure gradients of 0 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 30cm.<br><br>
The CSF indicates an absorbency of the water-absorbent agent composition subjected to a predetermined pressure gradient for a predetermined time under load of 1.93 kPa (about 0.28 psi). The following will explain a method for measuring the CSF in reference to Figure 2.<br>
One end of a conduit 3 was connected with a lower portion of a glass filter 2 (having a liquid absorbing surface and a diameter of 60 mm) of a porous glass plate 1 (Glass filter particle number #3; Buchner filter produced by Sogo Laboratory Glass Works Co., Ltd., TOP 17G-3 (code no. 1175-03)), and another end of the conduit 3 was connected with an attachment opening formed at a lower portion of the liquid vessel 4 having a diameter of 10 cm. An average pore diameter of the porous glass plate 1 was 20 µm to 30 µm. Even though the difference between liquid levels was 60 cm, it is possible to keep water in the porous glass plate 1 by its capillary force while counteracting a negative pressure of a water column, and also possible to maintain a state of no introduction of air. A support ring 5 for allowing the glass filter 2 to move up and down was attached to the glass filter 2, a system (the liquid vessel 4, the conduit 3 and the porous glass plate 1) was filled with a 0.90 mass % physiological saline 6, and the liquid vessel 4 was placed on a balance 7. After confirming that no air was in the conduit 3 and the lower portion of the porous glass plate 1, the glass filter 2 was adjusted so that the vertical interval between the liquid level of the 0.90 mass % physiological saline 6 in the liquid vessel 4 and the upper surface of the porous glass plate 1 was a predetermined length. Then, the glass filter 2 was fixed to a stand 8.<br>
W (gram) (about 0.90 gram) of a measurement sample 9 (the water-absorbent agent composition or the water-absorbent agent) was uniformly and quickly sprinkled on the glass filter 2 of the porous glass plate 1. Then, a load 10 (1.93 kPa (about 0.28 psi)) having a diameter of 59 mm was placed on the measurement sample 9. 60 minutes later, a mass W5 (gram) of the 0.90 mass % physiological saline absorbed by the measurement sample 9 was measured.<br>
The CSF of each pressure gradient can be calculated by the following formula.<br>
CSF (g/g) = W5 (gram) / W (gram)<br>
In a case where the CSFs of the water-absorbent agent subjected to the negative pressure gradients of 0cm, 10cm, 20cm and 30cm are termed CSF-Ocm, CSF-lOcm, CSF-2Ocm and CSF-3Ocm, respectively, the CSI can be calculated by the following formula.<br>
CSI = (CSF-Ocm) + (CSF-lOcm) + (CSF-2Ocm) + (CSF-3Ocm)<br>
[Liquid Distribution Velocity (LDV)]<br>
The LDV can be calculated from the liquid updrawing speed (WR). The WR was obtained by using an updrawing index measurement apparatus disclosed in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 5-200068 (Tokukaihei 5-200068 (EP532002)),<br>
As shown in Figure 3, in the updrawing index measurement apparatus, one end   of   a   trough   sheet   51    (made   by   SUS3O4   stainless   steel   (grade   2B<br><br>
finishing)) made of hard metal and having six trough grooves 52 was sealed by a 100 mesh stainless steel screen 53 (having 150 micron openings), and the screen 53 was soldered to the trough sheet 51 so as to hold the water-absorbent agent composition under the test. Each of the trough grooves 52 has a side angle of 9O°C, and has a length of at least 20 cm. The interval between peaks of the trough grooves 52 was 5.5 cm, and the depth of the trough groove 52 was 4 cm. Note that the artificial urine can pass through the screen 53. A crossbar 54 attached to the trough sheet 51 supports the trough sheet 51 by an experimental stand 55 having an appropriate fixation means such as a clamp. A liquid reserving tank 56 has such an adequate size that one end, to which the screen 53 was attached, of the trough sheet 51 can soak in liquid in the liquid reserving tank 56. Moreover, the liquid reserving tank 56 is filled with the artificial urine 57. An experimental jack 58 causes the liquid reserving tank 56 to move up and down, so as to adjust the liquid level of the artificial urine 57.<br>
Moreover, as shown in Figure 4, in the updrawing index measurement apparatus, the trough sheet 51 was supported by the experimental stand 55 at an angle of 20° with respect to a horizontal surface.<br>
The following will explain a method for measuring the WR using the updrawing index measurement apparatus,<br>
First, 1.00 gram ± 0.005 gram of a water-absorbent agent composition 59 was sprinkled uniformly between a scale marking 0 cm and a scale marking 20cm of each of the trough grooves 52 of the trough sheet 51 provided at an angle of 20°. Further, the water-absorbent agent composition was sprinkled more uniformly with a spatula.<br>
Used as the artificial urine 57 was a physiological saline prepared by mixing 1 L of a 0.9 mass % colored physiological saline (sodium chloride aqueous solution) with 0,01 gram of food blue No. 1 (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.).<br>
First, the trough sheet 51 was adjusted so that its lowest portion was located 0,5 cm above the liquid surface of the liquid reserving tank 56, and then the measurement of the WR was started at the same time the screen 53 contacted the liquid. The WR is a time (sec) from when the screen 53 contacts the liquid until when the liquid reaches a scale marking 10 cm. Note that the speed of the liquid, in the liquid reserving tank 56, being absorbed from the lowest portion of the trough sheet 51 to a position 0,5 cm above the lowest portion in a vertical direction with respect to the liquid surface was 1.35 mm/s to 1.40 mm/s.     The LDV can be calculated by the following formula.<br>
LDV (mm/s) = 100 (mm) / WR (s)<br>
(Liquid Distribution Velocity Decreasing Rate (LDV decreasing rate)]<br>
The LDV decreasing rate is an index for measuring the impact resistance of the liquid distribution velocity of the water-absorbent agent composition, and is calculated by the following formula as the decreasing rate from the LDV before an LDV resistance test described below,<br>
LDV  Decreasing  Rate   (%)   =  {(LDV  (mm/s)   Before  Test  -  LDV  (mm/s)  After<br><br>
Test) / LDV (mm/s) Before Test} *  100<br>
The LDV after the test may become larger than the LDV before the test depending on the type of the measurement sample. In this case, the decreasing rate is regarded as 0%.<br>
[Liquid Distribution Velocity (LDV) Resistance Test]<br>
The LDV resistance test is a test of putting the water-absorbent agent composition in a vessel 41 shown in Figure 5, and elliptically vibrating the vessel 41 under conditions where (i) as shown in Figure 6(a), an angle between a vertical center line of the vessel 41 moved to the left or the right and a plumb line is 12.5°, (ii) as shown in Figure 6 (b), the vessel 41 is caused to move forward and backward in a horizontal direction by 8 mm from a rest position of the vessel 41, and (iii) vibration speed rotation number is 750 c.p.m.     The following will specifically explain a method for this test.<br>
30.0 grams of the water-absorbent agent composition was put into the vessel 41 shown in Figure 5 having a capacity of 225 grams, and the vessel 41 was closed with an inner lid 41b and an outer lid 41a. Then, the vessel 41 was sandwiched by an upper clamp 43 and a lower clamp 44 of a disperser (Toyo Seiki Seisaku-sho, Ltd., No. 488 Test Disperser (Paint Shaker)) 42 shown in Figure 7, so as to be fixed to the disperser 42. The vessel 41 was vibrated under conditions of 100 V, 60 Hz and 750 c.p.m. for 50 minutes. Thus, the vessel 41 attached to the disperser 42 carries out a tilting movement at an angle of 12*5° (total 25°) to the right and left side with respect to an attachment surface 45 to which the upper clamp 43 and the lower clamp 44 were attached, and the same time, the vessel 41 vibrates forward and backward by 8 mm (total 16 mm). This applies the impact force to the water-absorbent agent composition in the vessel 41. Then, after the vibration, the water-absorbent agent composition was taken out of the vessel 41, and the LDV (LDV after the test) was measured.<br>
The following will explain a trajectory of the vessel 41 in more detail. As shown in Figure 8, the trajectory of the vessel 41 can be easily confirmed by a trajectory of the plumb line of a bar 47, at an arbitrary position, fixed to clamps 60 (the upper clamp 43, the lower clamp 44) vertically with respect to a direction of gravitational force. Since the bar 47 inclines at 12.5° to the right and left side from a resting state and at the same time moves forward and backward by 8 mm, the plumb line of the bar 47, at an arbitrary position, fixed to the clamps 60 draws an elliptic trajectory shown in Figure 8. That is, the vessel 41 was elliptically vibrated as shown in Figure 8.<br>
[Moisture Content]<br>
The moisture content of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) was obtained in the following manner using drying loss.<br>
W (gram) (about 2.00 grams) of the water-absorbent agent composition was put in an aluminum cup having a bottom surface diameter of 52 mm, and a total mass W6 (gram) of the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) and the aluminum cup was measured. Then, the aluminum   cup   containing   the   water-absorbent   agent   composition   (or   the<br><br>
water-absorbent agent) was dried at ambient temperature of l8OºC for three hours using a ventilation drier. The aluminum cup was taken out of the drier, and placed in a desiccator at room temperature (25°C ± 2°C) for five minutes. In this way, the water-absorbent agent composition (or the water-absorbent agent) was cooled down naturally. Then, a total mass W7 (gram) of the dried water-absorbent agent composition (or the dried water-absorbent agent) and the aluminum cup was measured. The moisture content (mass %) was calculated by the following formula using the W, W6 and W7.<br>
Moisture Content (mass %) = {(W6 (gram) - W7 (gram)) / W (gram)} *  100<br>
[Average gap radius index under no pressure]<br>
An average gap radius index under no pressure (gel gap index under no pressure) was measured with respect to water-absorbent particles or water-absorbent agent composition particles when the particles were saturatedly swollen.<br>
The height of liquid increased in a tube having a radius = R due to the capillary force is expressed as h, and h is found by: h = 2ycos0/pgR, where y expresses surface tension of liquid, 0 expresses contact angle, g expresses gravity acceleration, and p expresses density of liquid (see "TEXTILE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 13 ABSORBENT TECHNOLOGY 2002" (ELSEVIER), p428 Formula (35) P.K.Chatterjee. B.S.Gupta).<br>
In the device of Figure 9, the difference between the top of the liquid level of the liquid tank and the top of the glass filter 62 of the filter funnel 61 is increased from 0 to h (cm). As a result, the liquid between the swollen gel particles or the liquid in the gaps of the absorber is discharged from a part larger in diameter than the radius (gap: R µm) of capillary tube. As such, the saturatedly swollen gel in which all the gaps are filled with liquid is increased in height from 0 cm, and the amount of liquid remaining in the gaps is measured at some predetermined heights* The distribution of gap radius (radius of capillary tube) in the swollen gel is thus found.<br>
Here, the capillary tube radius R of a sample, which is measured at some predetermined heights "hw according to the foregoing formula (h = 2ycos0/pgR) is defined as a gap radius of the sample. The difference between the height of liquid surface in the liquid tank and the midpoint of the glass filter in the thickness direction is increased stepwise so that the difference sequentially changes to 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 30cm, and 60cm* As a result, the liquid held in the gap of the corresponding height is discharged. The distribution of the gap radius (capillary tube radius) can be found by measuring the discharge liquid. The measurement results are plotted in a logarithmic probability paper, and the value of D5O is found as an average gap radius. In the present example, y is surface tension (O.O728N/m) of physiological saline (0.9 mass% NaCl solution), 0 is 0°, p is density of physiological saline (1000kg/m3), and g is gravity acceleration at 9.8m/s2, in the formula: h = 2ycos0/pgR.<br>
According to this, the respective liquids held at the heights of 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, 10cm,   20cm,   30cm   and   60cm   are   found   to   be   held   by   the   gap   radiuses (capillary radiuses) of l485µm, 743µm, 297µm, l49µm, 74.3µm, 49.5µm and<br><br>
24.8µm. The contact angle 9 is 0° in this measurement method because this measurement is performed with a sample which sufficiently absorbed the liquid or sufficiently wet. The following specifically explains each process of the measurement.<br>
An end of a conduit 63 was connected to the bottom of the glass filter 62 (60mm in diameter) constituting the liquid absorption surface of the filter funnel (glass filter particle number #3: 20 to 30 µm in average hole diameter, 60cm in height (h = 60cm), no air supply) 61. The other end of the conduit 63 was connected to the bottom of the liquid tank 64 (10cm in diameter). In the process of connection, exclusion of air from the glass filter 62 was confirmed. The filter funnel 61 was fixed with the clamp 65 so that the liquid absorption surface becomes horizontal. At this point, the filter funnel 61 including its bottom and the conduit 63 were both filled with physiological saline. The liquid tank 64 was placed on a balance 67 connected to a computer 70 so that a change in mass of the liquid tank 64 is recorded into the computer 70. The filter funnel 61 fixed by the clamp 65 was arranged to automatically descend or ascend by an automatic ascensor programmed in advance. The ascending/descending speed of the filter funnel 61 was set to l.Ocm/sec.<br>
After confirming that there is no bubbles (air) under the glass filter 62 of the filter funnel 61 and in the conduit 63, the liquid surface of the physiological saline 66 in the liquid tank 64 is brought to the same height as that of the midpoint of the glass filter in the thickness direction.<br>
Next, the filter funnel 61 was ascended until the difference between the midpoint of the glass filter 62 in the thickness direction and the point of height 0cm becomes 60cm, and the balance is set to 0 at this point. Note that, hereinafter, the "height of the filter funnel 61" refers to the difference between the midpoint of the glass filter 62 in the thickness direction and the point of height 0* The point of height 0 is the point where the liquid surface of the physiological saline 66 in the liquid tank 64 comes to the same height as that of the midpoint of the glass filter in the thickness direction.<br>
After the recording by the computer 70 was started, a measurement sample 69 (water-absorbent agent or water-absorbent agent composition) was placed on the glass filter 62. In the case of using particulate measurement sample 69, about O.9OOg (W) of the particles adjusted in 600 µm to 300 µm by a sieve were quickly and evenly dispersed on the glass filter 62. In the case of using other types of measurement sample 69, the sample was cut into a disk 57mm in diameter, and the mass (W) of the dry disk was measured before placing it on the glass filter 62. Note that, a blank test was also performed in the same manner described below with an empty glass filter.<br>
The height of the filter funnel 61 was adjusted to -3cm (so that the glass filter 62 becomes lower than the liquid surface), and the measurement sample 69 was left to be swollen until the change in liquid mass becomes less than O.OO2g/min (eg. 30 minutes). At this time, the measurement sample 69 was completely soaked in the physiological saline, and no air-bubbles (air) were contained in the measurement sample 69.<br>
The height of the filter funnel 61 was adjusted back to 0cm, and the glass filter 62 was kept at the same height until the change in liquid mass became<br><br>
less than O.OO2g/min (eg. 60 minutes)* When the change in liquid mass became less than O.OO2g/min, the value of the balance was taken as ttA0B.<br>
Similarly, the height of the filter funnel 61 was changed to 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 30cm and 60cm, and the respective values of the balance at the time  where  the  change  in  liquid  mass  became  less  than  O.OO2g/min  were<br>
taken as "Al", MA2", *A5", "A10",   "   A2O", "A3O", and "A6O".<br>
In the blank test where the glass filter 62 does not contain the measurement sample 69, the height of the filter funnel 61 was also changed to Ocm, 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 30cm and 60cm, and the respective values of the balance at the time where the change in liquid mass became less than O.OO2g/min were taken as "BO% "Blw, "B2", "B3", "B4", *B5", "BIO", "B2O", «B30" and *B6O".<br>
In this measurement method, a calculation result of (A6O-B6O) was used as a reference value and the gap water amount at each height was found (an absolute value is used as the value measured by a balance is a negative value) by subtracting the reference value from the liquid mass amount (eg, A30-B30) at each height (Ocm, 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 30cm and 60cm),<br>
With this gap water amount at each height, the ratio of the total gap water amount was calculated. As described above, the liquids held respectively at 1cm, 2cm, 5cm, 10cm, 20cm, 30cm and 60cm were assumed to be maintained within gap radiuses (capillary tube radiuses) of l485µm, 743µm, 297µm, l49µm, 74,3µm, 49.5µm, and 24.8µm. That is, the liquid held at a height of 60cm passes through a gap radius (capillary radius) of 24.8µm. As such, each ratio of the total gap water amount and the foregoing value of the capillary radius are plotted on a logarithmic probability paper. With this graph, the gap radius (D5O) corresponding to 50% of the ratio of the total gap water amount was found as an "average gap radius index under no pressure" for the sample. Further, a logarithmic standard deviation (o£) for the distribution was found according to the ratio of the total gap water amount.<br>
Further, the calculation result was confirmed by finding another "average gap radius index under no pressure" by the method above by using spherical glass beads of 350 to 500 µm and of 1000 to 1180 µm. The calculation results were 86µm and 2l7µm, respectively.<br>

A reaction liquid was prepared by dissolving 11.3 mass parts of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (the average addition mole number of ethylene oxides is 9) in 5,460 mass parts of a sodium acrylate aqueous solution (monomer concentration of 38 mass %) which was prepared by mixing acrylic acid, a sodium acrylate aqueous solution and deionized water and has a neutralization rate of 75 mole %.

The centrifuge retention   capacity   (CRC)   of   the   water-absorbent   agent   (A5)   was   32   g/g.<br><br>

Thus, the hydrated gel polymer in which 72 mole % of carboxyl group was neutralized was obtained.<br>
The hydrated gel polymer was sprinkled on a 50 mesh metal gauze (mesh size 300 µm), and dried for 30 minutes with the through-air drier which realizes a wind speed of 2*0 m/s and a temperature of l4OºC. The dried polymer was crushed in the same manner as Reference Example 2, and classified by metal gauzes of mesh size 590 µm and mesh size 250 µm (30 mesh to 60 mesh) for adjusting the particle size. Thus, a water-absorbent agent (A9) was obtained.<br>
While stirring the water-absorbent agent (A9) at high speed (L6dige mixer, 330 rpm), 2 mass parts of a surface crosslinking agent aqueous solution (a water/methanol mixed solution of 10% ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (mass ratio of water : methanol - 70 : 30)) prepared by mixing 0.2 mass part of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, 1.26 mass parts of water and 0.54 mass part of methanol was sprayed into 100 mass parts of the water-absorbent agent (A9) and mixed with the agent (A9). Then, the resulting mixture was placed in a heating furnace set at l4OºC for 30 minutes, so as to be crosslinked by heat. Thus, a surface crosslinked water-absorbent agent (B9) was obtained* The SFC of the surface crosslinked water-absorbent agent (B9) was 0.<br><br>
Further, 1 mass part of the colloidal silica, LUDOX® HS-30, which is a<br>
colloid aqueous solution of amorphous silicon oxide in a non-porous<br>
spherical shape and is used in Example 3, was added to the surface<br>
crosslinked      water-absorbent      agent      (B9).	Thus,      a      comparative<br>
water-absorbent agent composition (C9) was obtained. Physical properties of the comparative water-absorbent agent composition (C9) were measured, and measurement results were shown in Tables 1 to 3.<br>

N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide and 241 mass parts of deionized water were put<br>
in the glass reaction vessel of 1 L in capacity. This reaction liquid in the<br>
glass reaction vessel had the monomer concentration of 25 mass % and the<br>
neutralization rate of 72 mole %. While stirring and mixing, the reaction<br>
liquid was kept at 2°C, and nitrogen was caused to flow in the reaction liquid<br>
for 30 minutes to remove dissolved oxygen* Next, 1 mass part of 1%<br>
aqueous hydrogen peroxide, 1.2 mass parts of a 0.2% L-ascorbic acid<br>
aqueous solution and 2.8 mass parts of a 2% 2,2'-azobis amidinopropane<br>
dihydrochloride aqueous solution were added and mixed to initiate<br>
polymerization.	After    the    polymerization    started,    the    polymerization<br>
temperature was kept at 7O°C to 8O°C by controlling a bath temperature. About 8 hours later, the hydrated gel polymer was taken out. While finely cutting the obtained hydrated gel polymer with the twin-arm kneader, 72.7 mass parts of a 45 mass % sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added and the mixture was kneaded for 30 minutes. Thus, the hydrated gel polymer in which 72 mole % of carboxyl group was neutralized was obtained. The hydrated gel polymer was sprinkled on a 50 mesh metal gauze (mesh size 300 µm), and dried for 30 minutes with the through-air drier which realizes a wind speed of 2.0 m/s and a temperature of l5OºC. The dried polymer was crushed in the same manner as Reference Example 3, and classified by metal gauzes of mesh size 710 µm and mesh size 150 µm for adjusting the particle size. Thus, a water-absorbent agent (A10) was obtained.<br>
While keeping 100 mass parts of the water-absorbent agent (A10) at 5O°C and stirring it with the twin-arm kneader at high speed, 9.5 mass parts of a surface crosslinking agent aqueous solution (mass ratio of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether : water : methanol - 2 : 70 : 30) prepared by mixing 0.19 mass part of ethylene glycol diglycidyl ether, 2.79 mass parts of water and 6.52 mass parts of methanol was dropped onto the water-absorbent agent (A10). Then, the resulting mixture was continuously mixed at 5O°C for 15 minutes. Further, the mixture was placed in the heating furnace set at 140oC for 40 minutes, so as to be crosslinked by heat. Thus, a surface crosslinked water-absorbent agent (B10) was obtained. The SFC of the obtained     surface     crosslinked     water-absorbent     agent      (B10)     was     6<br>
(unit:10-7cm3•s/g).<br>
Further, while stirring the surface crosslinked water-absorbent agent (B10) with the twin-arm kneader at high speed, 4.0 mass parts of a mixed solution prepared by mixing (i) 1.0 mass part of the colloidal silica, LUDOX® HS-30 which is a colloid aqueous solution of amorphous silicon oxide in a non-porous spherical shape and is used in Example 3, and (ii) 3.0 mass parts of methanol was dropped on the surface crosslinked water-absorbent agent<br><br>
(BIO), Then, the mixture was dried in the heating furnace set at lOOºC for 30 minutes, and granulated. The mixture was classified by a metal gauze of mesh size 710 µm to remove the generated coarse particles. Thus, a comparative water-absorbent agent composition (CIO) was obtained. Physical properties of the comparative water-absorbent agent composition (CIO) were measured, and measurement results were shown in Tables 1 to 3.<br>
