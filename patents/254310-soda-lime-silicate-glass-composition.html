				<td>SODA-LIME-SILICATE GLASS COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a soda-lime-silicate<br>
glass composition intended for the production of<br>
articles, particularly glass hollowware, or else those<br>
in the form of sheets of flat glass, the said<br>
composition giving these said articles the following<br>
properties: low transmission of ultraviolet radiation,<br>
high transmission of visible radiation, and neutral<br>
colour.<br>
Although the invention is not limited to such an<br>
application, it will be more particularly described<br>
with reference to applications in the field of glass<br>
hollowware, such as bottles, flasks or pots.<br>
Ultraviolet radiation (UV), in particular solar radiation, may interact with many liquids and sometimes<br>
 degrade their quality. This is for example the case<br><br>
 with certain consumable liquids, including certain<br>
wines, spirits, beer or olive oil, the colour and the<br>
taste of which may be impaired, or else certain<br>
perfumes, the aroma of which may be modified. There is<br>
therefore a real need, both in the agri-foodstuffs<br>
industry and the cosmetics industry, for glass<br>
containers capable of absorbing most of the ultraviolet<br>
radiation.<br>
Glass containers meeting this constraint are extremely<br>
commonplace, but in general they are strongly coloured.<br>
Wine and beer are for example often contained in brown<br>
or green bottles, such colorations being obtained by<br>
the addition of pigments such as chromium oxide or<br>
sulphides of transition elements, such as iron<br>
sulphides.. However, these tinted containers have the<br>
drawback of masking the coloration of the liquid that<br>
they contain.<br>
In certain cases, it may be desirable, mainly for<br><br>
aesthetic reasons, to be able to fully appreciate the<br>
coloration of the contents, and therefore to have<br>
containers of both a high light transmission and a<br>
neutral tint.<br>
Solutions intended to solve this technical problem have<br>
been described, these generally consisting in adding to<br>
a glass composition oxides that preferably absorb<br>
ultraviolet radiation, such as cerium oxide or vanadium<br>
oxide.<br>
Publication US 6 407 021 thus discloses containers made<br>
of glass whose composition comprises 0.2 to 1 wt%<br>
cerium oxide expressed in CeO2 form and 0.01 to<br>
0.08 wt% manganese oxide expressed in MnO2 form. The<br>
latter oxide is added so as to compensate for the<br>
green-yellow tint due to the iron oxide contained in<br>
the composition with a content of at least 0.01%.<br>
Application JP 11-278863 also discloses the use of cerium<br>
oxide, in mass content between 0.1 and 1%, and also cobalt<br>
and, optionally, selenium oxide, the addition of the<br>
latter two compounds also having the effect of<br>
"decolorizing" the glass, that is to say compensating for<br>
the yellow tint provided by the cerium.<br>
The main drawback of cerium oxide is its relatively low<br>
efficiency in absorbing ultraviolet radiation, which<br>
means that it is often necessary to use contents of<br>
greater than 0.5 wt%. Furthermore, a person skilled in<br>
the art knows that cerium, alone or in combination with<br>
certain compounds such as vanadium oxide, gives the<br>
glass "solarization" properties, this term meaning<br>
changes in tint undergone by the glass when it is<br>
exposed to high-energy radiation, such as ultraviolet<br>
radiation.<br>
Vanadium oxide is a useful substitute for cerium oxide,<br><br>
as its absorptivity for UV radiation is much greater<br>
than that of cerium oxide. However, it may exhibit an<br>
undesirable green coloration, which means the addition<br>
of "decolorizing" oxides.<br>
Application WO 00/35819 discloses the use of vanadium<br>
oxide and phosphorus oxide, the vanadium oxide content<br>
being less than 0.3% expressed as a percentage by<br>
weight.<br>
Application WO 02/066388 discloses compositions<br>
containing small amounts of vanadium and manganese<br>
oxides, with contents of between 0.04 and 0.10% and<br>
between 0.04 and 0.13% respectively, the V2O5/MnO ratio<br>
being between 0.6 and 1.7. However, and even though<br>
manganese oxide is described as acting as a bleacher,<br>
especially through the Mn3+ ion, the glasses exemplified<br>
in that document have dominant wavelengths, generally<br>
of around 560 to 570 nm, demonstrating a slightly<br>
yellow or amber tint. The absorption of ultraviolet by<br>
the glasses disclosed in the examples is characterized<br>
by a transmission of between 1 and 7% at a wavelength<br>
of 330 nm.<br>
Application JP-A-52-47812 also discloses glasses<br>
containing small amounts of vanadium oxide and<br>
manganese oxide, but it considers it to be necessary to<br>
add cerium oxide (with a content of at least 0.15%) and<br>
selenium oxide (at least 0.004%, i.e. 40 ppm, for this<br>
colouring compound is a high content).<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a<br>
soda-lime-silicate glass composition that can be used<br>
to form glass hollowware possessing a low ultraviolet<br>
transmission, a high transmission in the visible<br>
wavelengths and a neutral tint, so that the appearance<br>
of their contents can be seen perfectly, while still<br>
protecting the organoleptic characteristics of the said<br><br>
contents.<br>
These objects are achieved according to the present<br>
invention by the glass composition which includes the<br>
following optical absorbents in contents varying within<br>
the following weight limits:<br>
Fe2O3 (total iron)	0.01 to 0.15%;<br>
V2O5	0.11 to 0.40%;<br>
MnO	0.05 to 0.40%,<br>
the glass having the said composition being furthermore<br>
characterized, for a thickness of 3 mm, by an<br>
ultraviolet transmission (Tuv) of less than 40% and a<br>
neutral colour defined by the colorimetric coordinates<br>
a* and b*, each of which is between -3 and +3.<br>
V2O5 and MnO represent the total contents of vanadium<br>
oxide and manganese oxide respectively.<br>
The ultraviolet transmission (Tuv) of the glass<br>
according to the invention is calculated for a<br>
thickness of 3 mm, based on an experimental spectrum<br>
measured, using the solar spectral distribution defined by Parry Moon (J. Franklin Institute, Volume 230,<br>
pp 583-617, 1940) for an air mass 2 and within the<br>
wavelength range from 295 to 380 nm.<br>
The Tuv of the glass according to the invention<br>
preferably does not exceed 30%, especially does not<br>
exceed 25%, or even 20%.<br>
The glass falling within the context of the present<br>
invention is glass of neutral tint, that is to say it<br>
has a transmission curve which varies hardly with the<br>
visible wavelength.<br>
In the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage)<br>
system, bodies that are ideally neutral (or grey) do<br>
not possess a dominant wavelength and their excitation<br><br>
purity is zero. By extension, the body is generally<br>
accepted as being grey if its curve is relatively flat<br>
in the visible range but does have, however, weak<br>
absorption bands that allow a dominant wavelength and a<br>
low, but non-zero purity to be defined.<br>
The glass according to the invention is defined<br>
hereafter by its chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b*<br>
calculated from an experimental spectrum for glass<br>
specimens 3 mm in thickness, taking as reference the<br>
"CIE 1931" reference observer and the standard<br>
illuminant C, both being defined by the CIE. Using this<br>
notation, a body having a neutral coloration is<br>
characterized by a pair of parameters (a*,b*) close to<br>
(0,0) . The glass according to the invention is defined<br>
as having the following:<br>
a* varies from -3 to +3<br>
b* varies from -3 to +3.<br>
Glass having an even greater neutrality is preferably<br>
characterized by an a* value of preferably between -2<br>
and +2, especially between -1 and +1, and by a b* value<br>
of preferably between 0 and +3. The slightly positive<br>
b* values correspond in fact to glass having a slight<br>
yellow coloration, which ensures better colour<br>
rendering than a bluish coloration characterized by<br>
negative b* values.<br>
The use of the aforementioned optical absorbents within<br>
the limits of the invention makes it possible to give<br>
the glass the desired properties and also to optimize<br>
its optical and energy properties.<br>
The action of the absorbents taken individually is in<br>
general well described in the literature.<br>
The presence of iron in a glass composition may result<br>
from the batch materials, as impurities or from<br><br>
deliberate addition for the purpose of colouring the<br>
glass. It is known that iron exists in the structure of<br>
the glass in the form of ferric ions (Fe3+) and ferrous<br>
ions (Fe2+) . The presence of Fe3+ ions gives the glass a<br>
slight yellow coloration and allows the ultraviolet<br>
radiation to be absorbed. The presence of Fe2+ ions<br>
gives the glass a more pronounced green-blue coloration<br>
and causes infrared radiation to be absorbed.<br>
Increasing the content of iron in both its forms<br>
increases the absorption of radiation at the extremes<br>
of the visible spectrum, this effect taking place to<br>
the detriment of the light transmission.<br>
In the present invention, the total iron content in the<br>
composition is between 0.01 and 0.15%, preferably<br>
between 0.02 and 0.10%. An iron content of less than<br>
0.01% means that the batch materials must have a high<br>
degree of purity, which results in too high a cost of<br>
the glass for use as bottles or flasks. Above 0.15%<br>
iron, the glass composition has too low a transmission<br>
in the visible range and an excessively pronounced<br>
green tint.<br>
Vanadium oxide exists in three oxidation states in the<br>
glass. The V5+ ion is responsible for ultraviolet<br>
absorption, whereas the V4+ and V3+ ions give an<br>
undesirable green coloration. Within the context of the<br>
present invention, and so as to obtain the desired UV<br>
transmission values, the total vanadium oxide content<br>
expressed in V2O5 form is necessarily not less than<br>
0.11%, preferably not less than 0.13%, or even 0.15 or<br>
0.16%, especially not less than 0.20%, and even more<br>
preferably not less than 0.25%. For reasons essentially<br>
due to the high cost of vanadium oxide, the content of<br>
the latter is preferably less than 0.40%, especially<br>
less than 0.30% and even less than 0.28%. Vanadium<br>
oxide contents of between 0.11 and 0.17% generally give<br>
glass having a Tuv of around 20 to 40%, whereas amounts<br><br>
that are greater than or equal to 0.17%, or even 0.19%,<br>
are often needed to ensure a Tuv of less than 20%. A<br>
vanadium oxide content of between 0.19 and 0.22% aims<br>
in this case to be particularly suitable.<br>
Manganese oxide exists in the glass in oxidized form<br>
(Mn3+)and reduced form (Mn2+. Whereas the reduced form<br>
produces only a very slight coloration, Mn3+ ions give<br>
the glass containing them an intense pink or violet<br>
coloration. As is well known to those skilled in the<br>
art, this form is particularly useful for compensating<br>
for the green tint attributable to iron oxide and, in<br>
the case of the present invention, to vanadium oxide.<br>
The inventors have nevertheless demonstrated an<br>
additional and unexpected beneficial effect . of<br>
manganese oxide on the UV transmission when this is<br>
used in combination with vanadium oxide. It has been<br>
discovered that the addition of manganese oxide makes<br>
it possible to reduce the vanadium oxide content needed<br>
to achieve a given Tuv, or even to reduce the Tuv, of a<br>
glass containing a given amount of vanadium oxide.<br>
Consequently, the glass according to the invention has<br>
an MnO content (representing the total content of<br>
manganese oxide) not less than 0.05%, preferably not<br>
less than 0.09%, or even 0.10%, and even more<br>
preferably not less than 0.13%. For the reasons<br>
mentioned above, the MnO contents are sometimes<br>
advantageously greater than 0.15%, especially greater<br>
than 0.18% and even greater than 0.20%. To avoid the<br>
appearance of an undesirable pink or violet coloration,<br>
the MnO content is kept at 0.40% or less, preferably<br>
0.25% or less, or even 0.22% or less.<br>
The inventors have also discovered that the optimized<br>
proportion of MnO to be introduced relative to the<br>
amount of vanadium oxide in order to achieve a neutral<br>
coloration varies according to the method employed for<br>
adding the optical absorbents, and especially according<br><br>
to the temperature which this method is carried out at.<br>
When the addition of the vanadium and manganese oxides<br>
or of manganese oxide alone is carried out in the<br>
melting furnace using the "tank coloration" method,<br>
usually within a temperature range from 1400°C to<br>
1500°C, the ratio R1, defined by the weight content of<br>
manganese oxide relative to the weight content of<br>
vanadium oxide, is preferably chosen to be between 1.2<br>
and 1.8, and especially to be not less than 1.5. When the<br>
addition of these oxides or of manganese oxide alone is<br>
carried out in a feeder for transporting the glass from<br>
the furnace to the forming devices, usually at<br>
temperatures of around 1200°C to 1300°C, this ratio Rl is<br>
preferably chosen to be not less than 0.5, or even 0.8,<br>
but to not exceed 1.2, or even 1.0. Especially in the case<br>
of feeder addition of the manganese and vanadium oxides or<br>
of manganese oxide alone, the combination of a vanadium<br>
oxide content of between 0.19 and 0.22% with a manganese<br>
oxide content of between 0.13 and 0.18% is particularly<br>
preferred. In general, and irrespective of the way in<br>
which the manganese and vanadium oxides are introduced,<br>
the ratio Rl must be increased if the glass has too low an<br>
a* value and must be decreased if the glass has too high<br>
an a* value.<br>
Cobalt oxide produces an intense blue coloration and so<br>
reduces the light transmission. Its role in the present<br>
invention is to compensate for any yellow component<br>
caused by an excessive Mn3+ ion content. The amount must<br>
therefdre be perfectly controlled in order to make both<br>
the light transmission and the coloration compatible<br>
with the use to which the glass is intended. According<br>
to the invention, the cobalt oxide content preferably does not exceed 0.0025%, preferably does not exceed<br>
0.0020%, or does not exceed 0.0015% even does not<br>
exceed 0.0010%. This is because above 0.0025% the light<br>
transmission of the glass becomes too low, and the tint<br>
becomes too blue.<br><br>
Within the context of the present invention, a<br>
particularly preferred composition, in particular when<br>
vanadium and manganese oxides are introduced in the<br>
tank, includes the following optical absorbents in a<br>
content varying within the following weight limits:<br><br>
Another preferred embodiment, in particular when the<br>
vanadium and manganese oxides or the manganese oxide<br>
alone, are added in the feeder, consists in choosing<br>
the following composition ranges:<br><br>
As a general rule, it is difficult to predict the<br>
optical and energy properties of a glass when it<br>
contains several optical absorbents. This is because<br>
such properties result from a complex interaction<br>
between the various absorbents, the behaviour of which<br>
is furthermore dependent on their oxidation state. This<br>
is particularly so in the case of compositions<br>
according to the invention, which contain at least<br>
three oxides existing in several valence states.<br>
in the present invention, the choice of optical<br>
absorbents, their content and their oxidation/reduction<br>
state are key factors for obtaining the required<br>
optical properties.<br>
In particular, the redox state defined by the ratio of<br>
the molar content of ferrous oxide (expressed as FeO)<br><br>
to the molar content of total iron (expressed as Fe2O3) ,<br>
is less than 0.2, preferably less than or equal to 0.1.<br>
The redox state is generally controlled using oxidizing<br>
agents, such as sodium sulphate, and reducing agents,<br>
such as coke, the relative contents of which are<br>
adjusted in order to obtain the desired redox state.<br>
The oxidized forms of vanadium and manganese may also<br>
fulfil an oxidizing role with respect to ion oxide,<br>
which makes it particularly complicated, or even<br>
impossible, to predict the optical properties of a<br>
glass resulting from a given batch mix.<br>
The composition according to the invention makes it<br>
possible to obtain a glass that preferably has an<br>
overall light transmission LTC calculated, for a<br>
thickness of 3 mm, from an experimental spectrum,<br>
taking the "CIE 1931" reference observer and the<br>
standard illuminant C as reference, that is not less<br>
than 70%, especially not less than 80%, thereby<br>
allowing the desired transparency effect to be<br>
obtained.<br>
The term "soda-lime-silicate" is used here in the<br>
widest sense and relates to any glass composition<br>
consisting of a glass matrix that comprises the<br>
following constituents (in percentages by weight):<br><br>
It should be mentioned here that the soda-lime-silicate<br>
glass composition may include, apart from the<br><br>
inevitable impurities contained in particular in the<br>
batch materials, a small proportion (up to 1%) of<br>
further constituents, for example agents for promoting<br>
the melting or refining of the glass (SO3, Cl, Sb2O3,<br>
AS2O3) , or coming from possible addition of recycled<br>
cullet into the batch mix.<br>
In the glass according to the invention, the silica<br>
content is generally maintained within narrow limits<br>
for the following reasons. Above 75%, the viscosity of<br>
the glass and its ability to devitrify increase<br>
greatly, which makes it more difficult to melt and flow<br>
on the bath of molten tin. Below 64%, the hydrolytic<br>
resistance of the glass rapidly decreases and the<br>
transmission in the visible also decreases.<br>
Alumina (Al2O3) plays a particularly important role in<br>
the hydrolytic resistance of the glass. When the glass<br>
according to the invention is intended to form<br>
hollowware containing liquids, the alumina content is<br>
preferably not less than 1%.<br>
The alkali metal oxides Na2O and K2O facilitate the<br>
melting of the glass and allow its viscosity to be<br>
adjusted at high temperatures so as to keep it close to<br>
that of a standard glass. K2O may be used up to 5%, as<br>
the problem of the high cost of the composition rises<br>
above this content. Moreover, the increase in<br>
percentage of K2O can be accomplished, essentially,<br>
only to the detriment of Na2O, which contributes to<br>
increasing the viscosity. The sum of the Na2O and K2O<br>
contents, expressed as percentages by weight, is<br>
preferably not less than 10% and advantageously does<br>
not exceed 20%. If the sum of these contents is greater<br>
than 20% or if the Na2O content is greater than 18%,<br>
the hydrolytic resistance is greatly reduced.<br>
Alkaline-earth oxides allow the viscosity of the glass<br><br>
to be adapted to the production conditions.<br>
MgO may be used up to about 10% and its omission may be<br>
at least partly compensated for by an increase in the<br>
Na2O and/or SiO2 content. Preferably, the MgO content is<br>
less than 5% and particularly advantageously less than<br>
2%, which has the effect of increasing the infrared<br>
absorptivity without impairing the transmission in the<br>
visible. Low MgO contents furthermore make it possible<br>
to reduce the number of batch materials needed for<br>
melting the glass.<br>
BaO allows the light transmission to be increased and<br>
can be added to the composition in a content of less<br>
than 5%.<br>
BaO has a much less pronounced effect than CaO and MgO<br>
on the viscosity of the glass, and the increase in its<br>
content is essentially accomplished to the detriment of<br>
the alkali metal oxides, of MgO and above all of CaO.<br>
Any BaO increase helps to increase the viscosity of the<br>
glass at low temperatures. Preferably, the glasses<br>
according to the invention contain no BaO.<br>
Apart from complying with the limits defined above as<br>
regards the variation in the content of each alkaline-<br>
earth metal oxide, it is preferable, in order to<br>
achieve the desired transmission properties, to limit<br>
the sum of the weight percentages of MgO, CaO and BaO<br>
to a value of 15% or less.<br>
The composition according to the invention may<br>
furthermore include additives, for example agents that<br>
absorb in certain spectral regions, such as oxides of<br>
transition elements (such as Cr2O3, TiO2, NiO, CuO etc.)<br>
or rare earth oxides (such as CeO2, La2O3, Nd2O3, Er2O3<br>
etc.) or else colouring agents in the elemental state<br>
(Se, Ag, Cu) . The content of such additives is less<br><br>
than 2%, preferably less than 1%, and even less than<br>
0.5%, or indeed zero (apart from inevitable<br>
impurities). It is particularly preferable for the<br>
glass according to the invention to contain no rare<br>
earth oxides, and especially no neodymium oxide, which<br>
is extremely expensive, and/or no cerium oxide, which<br>
may cause glass with a low iron content to suffer a<br>
solarization effect, the glass becoming brown under the<br>
action of high-energy radiation, such as UV radiation.<br>
The selenium content is also advantageously zero, this<br>
oxide having a strong tendency to volatilize during<br>
melting of the glass, requiring expensive<br>
decontamination equipment.<br>
The glass composition according to the invention is<br>
able to be melted under the production conditions for<br>
glass intended for forming hollowware or flat articles<br>
using the pressing, blowing or moulding techniques, or<br>
even drawing, rolling or floating techniques. Melting<br>
generally takes place in flame-fired furnaces,<br>
optionally provided with electrodes for heating the<br>
glass in the bulk, by passing an electric current<br>
between the two electrodes. To facilitate the melting<br>
operation, and especially to make the latter<br>
mechanically advantageous, the glass composition<br>
advantageously has a temperature corresponding to a<br>
viscosity η such that logη = 2 that is less than<br>
1500°C. Also preferably, the temperature corresponding<br>
to the viscosity η such that logη = 3.5 (denoted by<br>
T(logη = 3.5)) and the liquidus temperature, (denoted<br>
by Tliq) , satisfy the equation:<br><br>
and better still:<br><br>
The addition of optically absorbent oxides may be<br>
carried out in the furnace (the process is then<br>
referred to as "tank coloration") or in the feeders<br><br>
that transport the glass between the furnace and the<br>
forming installations (the process is then referred to<br>
as "feeder coloration"). Feeder coloration requires a<br>
particular addition/mixing installation, but does have,<br>
however, advantages as regards flexibility and<br>
reactivity that are particularly desirable when the<br>
production of an extended range of particular optical<br>
properties and/or tints is required. In the particular<br>
case of feeder coloration the optical absorbents are<br>
incorporated in glass frits or agglomerates, which are<br>
added to a clear glass in order to form, after<br>
homogenization, a glass according to the invention.<br>
Different frits can be employed for each added oxide,<br>
but it may be advantageous in certain cases to use a<br>
single frit containing all the useful optical<br>
absorbents. It is desirable for the vanadium oxide<br>
content or the manganese oxide content in the frits or<br>
agglomerates employed to be between 15 and 25% so as<br>
not to exceed levels of frit dilution in the molten<br>
glass greater than 2%. This is because above 2% is<br>
becomes difficult for the molten glass to be suitably<br>
homogenized, while still maintaining high output<br>
compatible with a low overall economic cost of the<br>
process. It has also been observed that the oxidation<br>
state of the vanadium and of the manganese within the<br>
frits plays a not insignificant role in determining the<br>
redox state of the final glass. Oxidized frits,<br>
therefore those containing vanadium or manganese ions<br>
predominantly in their highest oxidation state, allow<br>
the preferred redox states after mixing to be obtained<br>
more easily, and consequently it is preferable to<br>
employ such frits. Likewise, an oxidizing character of<br>
the flames produced above the glass melt contained in<br>
the feeder is preferred, it being possible to achieve<br>
this by adjusting the inflow of oxidizer relative to<br>
the fuel, such that the oxidizer is supplied<br>
superstoichiometrically. When the oxidizer is oxygen<br>
(O2) and the fuel is methane (CH4) , the O2/CH4 molar<br><br>
ratio is preferably not less than 2, especially not<br>
less than 2.1 or even 2.2. According to a preferred<br>
embodiment, only vanadium oxide is added in the tank,<br>
the manganese oxide being added in the feeder, in the<br>
form of frits or agglomerates.<br>
The present invention will be more clearly understood<br>
on reading the detailed description below of non-<br>
limiting illustrative examples and the figures appended<br>
hereto:<br>
•	Table 1 illustrates various glass compositions<br>
according to the invention;<br>
•	Table 2 illustrates the effect of the ratio R1<br>
of the weight content of manganese oxide to the weight<br>
content of vanadium oxide;<br>
•	Figure 1 illustrates the additional effect of<br>
manganese oxide on the Tuv when it is employed in<br>
combination with vanadium oxide.<br>
Examples of glass compositions given below (in Tables 1<br>
and 2) allow the advantages associated with the present<br>
invention to be more fully appreciated.<br>
These examples indicate the values of the following<br>
optical properties calculated, for a glass thickness of<br>
3 mm, from experimental spectra:<br>
the ultraviolet transmission (Tuv) calculated<br>
using the solar spectral distribution defined by Parry<br>
Moon (J. Franklin Institute, Volume 230, pp 583-617,<br>
1940) for an air mass 2 and within the wavelength range<br>
from 295 to 380 nm;<br>
the overall light transmission factor (LTC) ,<br>
calculated between 380 and 780 nm, and also the<br>
chromatic coordinates L*, a* and b* . These calculations<br>
were made using the illuminant C as defined by the<br>
ISO/CIE 10526 standard and the CIE 1931 colorimetric<br>
reference observer, as defined by the ISO/CIE 10527<br>
standard.<br><br>
Also indicated in Tables 1 and 2 are:<br>
the weight contents of iron oxide, vanadium<br>
oxide, manganese oxide and cobalt oxide;<br>
when it was measured, the redox state defined<br>
as the molar ratio of FeO to the total iron expressed<br>
in Fe2O3 form. The total iron content was measured by<br>
X-ray fluorescence and the FeO content was measured by<br>
wet chemistry;<br>
the ratio R1, equal to the mass content of<br>
manganese oxide compared to the mass content of<br>
vanadium oxide.<br>
Each of the compositions given in Tables 1 and 2 was<br>
produced from the following glass matrix, the contents<br>
of which are given in percentages by weight, the<br>
composition being corrected as regards silica in order<br>
to accommodate the total content of colouring agents<br>
added:<br><br>
Glass compositions 1 to 8 according to the invention,<br>
described in Table 1 were prepared by adding optical<br>
absorbents using a tank coloration method. They<br>
illustrate the important effect of vanadium oxide<br>
coupled with manganese oxide on the Tuv. Comparative<br>
Example 1 is a standard clear glass composition used<br>
both for hollow glassware and for flat glass. Its Tuv<br>
which exceeds 90%, is lowered to about 40% by adding<br>
0.11% vanadium oxide, and then down to 20% by adding<br>
larger amounts. Examples 6, 7 and 8 illustrate the<br>
effect of cobalt oxide, which serves to adjust the b*<br>
value in order to obtain, if desired, a slightly bluish<br><br>
tint. It may also be noted that these compositions,<br>
which have an R1 ratio close to 1.5, are more neutral<br>
than compositions 3, 4 and 5, which have an Rl ratio<br>
close to 1. The highest neutrality is characterized in<br>
particular by a* values closer to zero. This point<br>
illustrates the importance within the context of the<br>
present invention, of the R1 ratio. Example 1 shows<br>
that the V2O5 content of the glass compositions<br>
according to the invention must necessarily not be less<br>
than 0.11% in order to obtain an ultraviolet<br>
transmission of 40% or less.<br><br><br><br>
The examples given in Table 2 also	illustrate the<br>
importance that the R1 ratio can have	on the optical<br>
properties, depending on the method	in which the<br>
optically active materials were added.<br>
The two examples given (Comparative Example 2 and<br>
Example 9 according to the invention) have the same<br>
vanadium oxide, manganese oxide and cobalt oxide<br>
contents and are characterized by an Rl ratio close to<br>
1.5, but these oxides were added under different<br>
conditions. Whereas this Rl ratio is particularly well<br>
suited to the conditions in which the absorbent oxides<br>
are added in the furnace, and makes it possible to<br>
obtain a particularly neutral glass (Example 9), this<br>
same ratio is, in this precise case, poorly suited to<br>
the conditions in which the absorbent oxides are added<br>
to the feeder, since Comparative Example 2 has a very<br>
pronounced purple coloration characterized by very high<br>
a* and b* values and a low LTC. In contrast, Example 10,<br>
produced by feeder coloration, shows that a much lower<br>
Rl ratio is much better suited to this method of<br>
coloration.<br><br><br>
Figure 1 shows the effect of manganese oxide on the Tuv<br>
of glass compositions containing 0.09% Fe2O3 and 0.21%<br>
V2O5 (Examples 2 and 3 according to the invention) . The<br>
beneficial effect of manganese oxide in combination<br>
with vanadium oxide may be observed. This beneficial<br>
effect is surprising because only the decolorizing<br>
effect of manganese oxide, which relies on absorption<br>
in the visible range and not in the ultraviolet, was<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
