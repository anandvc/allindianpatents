ALTANA PHARMA AG GERMAN Company BYK-GULDEN-STRASSE 2, 78467 KONSTANZ, GERMANY<br><br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed .- -<br><br><br>
6 AUG 2007.<br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical preparation for treatment of diseases of the eye comprising a PDE 4 inhibitor, to processes for producing the pharmaceutical preparation and methods for treatment of diseases of the eye.<br>
Prior art<br>
Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors (specifically of type 4) are<br>
currently of special interest as a new generation of active ingredients for treating<br>
inflammatory disorders, especially disorders of the airways such as asthma or<br>
airway obstructions (such as, for example, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary<br>
disease). A number of PDE 4 inhibitors are currently undergoing advanced clinical<br>
testing, including a dosage form for oral administration comprising the active<br>
ingredient	N-	(3,	5-dichloropyrid-4-yl)-3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-<br>
difluoromethoxybenzamide (INN: roflumilast). This and other compounds with a benzamide structure and their use as cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors for the treatment of diseases are described in WO 95/01338.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found out, that pharmaceutical preparations comprising the PDE 4 inhibitor roflumilast show a very good effect and other beneficial properties in the treatment of diseases of the eye.<br>
In one aspect the present invention is therefore related to the use of a compound selected from the group consisting of roflumilast, salts of roflumilast, the N-oxide of the pyridine residue of roflumilast or salts thereof for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical preparation for the prevention or treatment of a disease of the eye.<br>
Roflumilast is the INN for a compound of the formula I<br>
2<br><br><br>
in which<br>
Rl is difluoromethoxy,<br>
R2 is cyclopropylmethoxy and<br>
R3 is 3,5-dichloropyrid-4-yl.<br>
This compound has the chemical name N- (3, 5-dichloropyrid-4-yl)-3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoro- methoxybenzamide (INN : roflumilast). The N-oxide of roflumilast has the chemical name 3-cyclopropylmethoxy-4-difluoromethoxy-N- (3, 5-dichloropyrid-4-yl 1-oxide) benzamide.<br>
This compound of the formula I, its salts, the N-oxide, its salts and the use of these compounds as phosphodiesterase (PDE) 4 inhibitors are described in the international patent application WO 95/01338.<br>
Salts suitable for compounds of the formula I-depending on the substitution-are all acid addition salts but, in particular, all salts with bases. Particular mention may be made of the pharmacologically acceptable salts of the inorganic and organic acids and bases normally used in pharmaceutical technology.<br>
Pharmacologically unacceptable salts, which for example, may be the initial products of the process for preparing the compounds of the invention on the industrial scale are converted into pharmacologically acceptable salts by processes known to the skilled worker. Those suitable on the one hand are water-soluble and water-insoluble acid addition salts with acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, citric acid, D-gluconic acid, benzoic acid, 2- (4-hydroxybenzoyl) benzoic acid, butyric acid,<br>
3<br><br>
sulphosalicylic acid, maleic acid, lauric acid, malic acid, furnaric acid, succinic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, embonic acid, stearic acid, toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulphonic acid, or 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid, the acids being employed to prepare the salts in the equimolar ratio of amounts, or one differing therefrom-depending on whether the acid is monobasic or polybasic and depending on which salt is desired.<br>
On the other hand, salts with bases are also particularly suitable. Examples oi basic salts which may be mentioned are lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminium, magnesium, titanium, ammonium, meglumine or guanidinium salts, once again the bases being employed to prepare the salts in the equimolar ratio of amounts or one differing therefrom.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations comprising roflumilast, salts of roflumilast, the N-oxide of the pyridine residue of roflumilast or salts thereof for treatment of diseases of the eye can be prepared by processes, which are known per se and familiar to the person skilled in the art. As pharmaceutical preparations, the active ingredient according to the invention can be either employed as such, or preferably in combination with suitable pharmaceutical auxiliaries, e. g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches, emulsions, suspensions, gels or solutions, the active compound content advantageously being between 0.1 and 95%. The person skilled in the art is familiar with auxiliaries, which are suitable for the desired pharmaceutical preparations on account of his expert knowledge. In addition to solvents, gel formers, ointment bases and other active compound excipients, for example antioxidants, dispersants, emulsifiers, preservatives, solubilizers or permeation promoters, can be used. Further examples, which may be mentioned, are carriers and/or excipients which are suitable for producing tablets, emulsions, suspensions, sprays, oils, ointments, greasy ointments, creams, pastes, gels, foams or solutions, and transdermal therapeutic systems.<br>
In  a  preferred   embodiment  according   to   the   invention   the  pharmaceutical<br>
4<br><br>
preparation for treatment of diseases of the eye is an ophthalmological pharmaceutical preparation suitable for administration in, on or close to the eye.<br>
In another embodiment the pharmaceutical preparation for treatment of diseases of the eye according to the invention is an administration form for systemic application.<br>
Another subject of the invention is therefore an ophthalmological pharmaceutical preparation comprising a therapeutically effective and pharmacologically suitable amount of an active pharmaceutical ingredient selected from the group of compounds roflumilast, salts of roflumilast, the N-oxide of roflumilast and salts together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Examples, which may be mentioned in connection with ophthalmological pharmaceutical preparations are eyebaths or eye lotions, eye inserts, eye ointments, eye sprays, eye drops, preparations for intraocular application [e. g. intravitreale application, intraocular injection] and eyelid ointments.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the ophthalmological pharmaceutical preparation is a topical pharmaceutical preparation, suitable for administration on or close to the eye comprising a therapeutically effective and pharmacologically suitable amount of an active pharmaceutical ingredient selected from the group of compounds roflumilast, salts of roflumilast, the N-oxide of roflumilast and salts together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the ophthalomological pharmaceutical preparation is a pharmaceutical preparation, suitable for intravitreal and/or intraocular application comprising a therapeutically effective and pharmacologically suitable amount of an active pharmaceutical ingredient selected from the group of compounds roflumilast, salts of roflumilast, the N-oxide of roflumilast and salts together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
5<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the ophthalmological pharmaceutical preparation    is    suitable    for    conjunctival    or    palpebral    administration.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dosage form of the invention is an eye ointment or eye drops. Eye drops preferably comprise according to the invention aqueous or oily suspensions of the active ingredient. It is preferred in this connection for the particle size of the active ingredient employed to be 90% less than l0 μm.<br>
Preferably used in the case of aqueous suspensions are suspension stabilizers such as, for example, substituted celluloses (e. g. methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose), polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl- pyrrolidone, in addition to preservatives (e.g. chlorocresol, phenylmercury compounds, phenylethanol, benzalkonium chloride or mixtures of individual components) and, where appropriate, sodium chloride to adjust to isotonicity. Preferably employed according to the invention in the case of oily eye drops are castor oil, peanut oil or medium chain length triglycerides. It is possible in the case of eye ointments to use according to the invention ointment bases which have the following properties: sterility or extremely low microbe content, non-irritating, good activity, good distribution of the active ingredient or its solution in the ointment, suppleness, rapid dispersion as fine film over the eyeball, good adhesion to the eye, good stability and low impairment of vision. Hydrocarbon-or cholesterol-containing bases will therefore preferably be employed according to the invention for eye ointments. In the case of petrolatum, liquid paraffin is preferably added for consistency reasons. To achieve good spreading, it is preferred according to the invention to provide compositions of limited viscosity. The viscosity at 32°C is preferably below lOOOmPa.s, and the yield point is preferably below 300 mPa. In the case of suspension ointments it is preferred according to the invention for 90% of the active ingredient particles to be below 10 μm, and no particles above 90 μm should occur. In the case of water/oil emulsion ointments, it is preferred according to the invention to add preservatives such as benzalkonium chloride, thiomersal or phenylethyl alcohol.<br>
6<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparation of the invention for systemic application can be a transdermal therapeutic system (TTS), for example a system as described in Pharmazeutische Technologie : Moderne Arzneiformen, Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH Stuttgart 1997, pages 81 et sec. TTSs are characterized in principle by a defined supply of medicinal substance to the skin, a total dose of the medicinal substance in the TTS, a total area and an area which is possibly different therefrom for re- lease of the medicinal substance, a covering sheet (backing layer) which is impermeable to the medicinal substance, a medicinal substance reservoir, a control element which controls the supply of medicinal substance to the skin, a (pressure-sensitive) adhesive layer and a detachable protective layer. It is possible on occasions for more than one function to be fulfilled by one and the same element, e. g. reservoir, control and adhesive functions by a suitable adhesive matrix. From the viewpoint of pharmaceutical technology, TTSs are categorized according to the way the control function is achieved, that is to say how it controls the supply of medicinal substance to the skin. Examples, which are mentioned here are TTSs with membrane permeation-controlled release (membrane moderated drug delivery), TTSs with matrix diffusion-controlled release and TTSs with microreservoir solution-controlled release.<br>
TTSs with membrane permeation-controlled release are characterized by a polymer membrane composed of a PVA-VA copolymer(Chronomer®) which controls the permeation of the medicinal substance from the reservoir into the skin. The medicinal substance is initially in the form of solid particles or as a dispersion or solution in the reservoir. The polymer membrane can be attached to the reservoir in various ways (extrusion, encapsulation, microencapsulation). TTSs with matrix diffusion-controlled release have a comparatively simpler structure. They contain no separate control element. The release of medicinal substance is controlled by a lipophilic or hydrophilic polymer matrix and/or the adhesive layer. It is possible to distinguish, according to the characteristics of the matrix, between TTSs with a matrix in gel form and TTSs which represent solid polymer laminates. The medicinal<br>
7<br><br>
substance reservoir is formed by the medicinal substance dissolved in the matrix (monolithic system) or a homogeneous dispersion of solid medicinal substance particles. A matrix ITS can be produced by mixing the medicinal substance particles with a viscous liquid or semisolid polymer at room temperature, followed by crosslinking the polymer chains. A further possibility is also to mix the medicinal substance at elevated temperature with softened polymer (hot melt technique), or the two components (dissolved in an organic solvent) are mixed together and the solvent is then removed in vacuo (solvent evaporation).<br>
Shaping is possible by pouring into suitable moulds, spreading with special devices (knives) or by extrusion. In the case of TTSs with microreservoir solution-controlled release (microsealed drug delivery, MDD principle), numerous microcompartments containing the active ingredient and 10-200 μm in size are embedded in a matrix which represents both reservoir and delivery-control element. Because of the matrix, these TTSs are actually assigned to the matrix systems. For production, the medicinal substance is initially dispersed together with water and 40% polyethylene glycol 400 in isopropyl palmitat, which acts as permeation promoter. The resulting dispersion is incorporated by using a special high- energy dispersion technique into a viscous silicone elastomer which simultaneously undergoes catalytic polymerization. The medicinal substance-containing matrix can be shaped specifically by melt or extrusion techniques before it is combined with the carrier in the manner already described. Depending on the physicochemical properties of the medicinal substances and the intended liberation, it is possible to cover the matrix with a layer of a biocompatible polymer in order thus to modify the mechanism and the rate of liberation.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the pharmaceutical preparation for systemic administration is a dosage form for oral administration, preferably a tablet.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical excipients, which may be used in the dosage form for oral administration of the invention are pharmaceutical excipients such as fillers,<br>
8<br><br>
additional binders, tablet disintegrants or else lubricants and release agents. Other suitable excipients, which may be present are, for example, flavoring substances (such as flavors and sweeteners), buffer substances, preservatives, coloring substances (such as iron oxid yellow or red) or else emulsifiers. Flavors are usually added in a proportion of from 0.05 to 1 % by weight. Other flavoring substances by way of example are acids such as citric acid, sweeteners such as saccharin, aspartame, cyclamate sodium or maltol, which are added according to the desired result<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the tablet for oral administration is employing polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as binder. The polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) employed according to the invention is, in particular, a water-soluble PVP with an average molecular weight above 2 000, preferably above 20 000. Examples, which may be mentioned are Kollidon 12 PF (molecular weight 2 000-3 000), Kollidon 17 PF (molecular weight 7000-11000), Kollidon 25 (molecular weight 28000-34000), Kollidon 30 (molecular weight 44000-54000), Kollidon 90 F (molecular weight 1 000 000-1 500 000). PVP of higher molecular weight such as, for example, Kollidon 25, Kollidon 30 and Kollidon 90 F may be mentioned as preferred.<br>
It is possible if desired to employ in addition to PVP other binders such as polyvinyl acetate (e. g. Kollidon® VA 64), gelatin, corn starch mucilage, preswollen starches (Starch 1500), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose(HPMC) or hydroxypropylcellulose (L-HPC).<br>
Fillers suitable according to the invention are fillers such as calcium carbonate (e. g.MagGran® CC or Destab® 95) and sodium carbonate, sugar alcohols such as mannitol (e. g.Perlitol® or Parteck® M), sorbitol (e. g.Karion®), xylitol or maltitol, starches such as corn starch, potato starch and wheat starch, microcrystalline cellulose, saccharides such as glucose, lactose (e. g. lactose monohydrate), levulose, sucrose and dextrose. It is also possible if desired to use mixtures thereof. Corn starch, microcrystalline cellulose and lactose may be mentioned as preferred.<br>
9<br><br>
Examples of suitable lubricants and release agents, which may be mentioned are sodium stearyl fumarate, magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, stearic acid, talc and colloidal anhydrous silica (Aerosil).<br>
Disintegrants suitable according to the invention are, in particular, insoluble polyvinylpyrrolidone (insoluble PVP, crospovidone), carboxymethylstarch sodium [= sodium starch glycolate], sodium carboxyme-thylcellulose, alginic acid, and starches able to carry out the function of a disintegrant (e. g. Starch 1500).<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of PDE 4 inhibitor in the dosage form of the invention is usually, depending on the nature of the PDE 4 inhibitor, from 0.01 to 50% by weight. The proportion of PDE 4 inhibitor is preferably up to 20% by weight.<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of binder (PVP and, where appropriate, other binders) may preferably be according to the invention from 0.5 to 20% by weight. The proportion of PVP is preferably from 1 to 5% by weight, particularly preferably 2 to 3% by weight.<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of filler in the tablet of the invention is advantageously from 40 to 99% by weight. The proportion of filler is preferably from 60 to 97% by weight.<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based oh the finished dosage form) of disintegrant in the rapidly disintegrating tablet can usually be up to 35% by weight. The proportion of disintegrant is preferably from 2 to 20% by weight. The proportion of disintegrant is particularly preferably from 5 to 10% by weight.<br>
The proportion (in percent by weight based on the finished dosage form) of lubricant or release agent in the rapidly disintegrating tablet is usually from 0.1 to 5% by weight. The proportion of lubricant or release agent is preferably from 0.3 to 3% by<br>
10<br><br>
weight. The proportion of lubricant or release agent is particularly preferably from 0.5 to 2% by weight.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the dosage form is a tablet. It is preferred for the tablet, besides the active ingredient and PVP, to comprise as further pharmaceutical excipients at least one filler and at least one lubricant or release agent.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation of the invention can be produced by processes for producing tablets and pellets, which are known to the skilled worker.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutical preparation of the invention is produced by producing a solid solution of the active ingredient in the binder PVP as carrier. This can take place for example by the solvent method in which PVP, the active ingredient and, where appropriate, other pharmaceutical excipients are dissolved in a suitable solvent, and the solvent is subsequently removed again by spray drying, normal drying, vacuum drying or freeze-drying. It has been found, surprisingly, that production of the solid solution is also possible by the mixing method in which the active ingredient and, where appropriate, other pharmaceutical excipients are vigorously mixed together with PVP.<br>
In the event of further processing of a solid solution to tablets or pellets, the solid solution may be processed as active ingredient component together with the filler, binder, disintegrant and lubricant components by production processes familiar to the skilled worker to give the oral dosage forms of the invention. A solid solution of the active ingredient in the binder PVP as carrier means according to the invention a solid solution with amorphous structure in which the active ingredient is in the form of a molecular dispersion in the carrier material.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation can be produced by a process for producing a dosage form in tablet or pellet form for oral administration of the active ingredient,<br>
11<br><br>
comprising the steps: (a) production of an active ingredient preparation in the form of a solid solution in PVP of the active ingredient,<br>
(b) production of a mixture of an active ingredient preparation and pharmaceutical excipients and (c) granulation of the mixture obtained in (b) with an aqueous solution of PVP.<br>
In the case of dosage forms of the invention in the form of tablets, the granules obtained in (c) can, after drying and mixing with lubricants or release agents, be compressed in a tablet press. In the case of dosage forms of the invention in the form of pellets, the wet granules obtained in (c) can be processed by the extruder/spheroidizer process to suitable pellets. Alternatively, dispersions/suspensions of an active ingredient preparation can be applied in the form of a solid solution in PVP of the active ingredient in a suitable solvent to pellet¬like carriers (e. g. nonpareils or HPMC-containing pellets).<br>
The dosage form of the invention can also be produced by granulating a mixture of active ingredient and pharmaceutical excipients with an aqueous PVP solution, drying the granules and, if desired, ad- mixing other pharmaceutical excipients. Wet preparations obtained after granulation can then be further processed to pellets and can subsequently be packed into capsules. Dried granules can-if desired after admixture of other pharmaceutical excipients-after mixing with a release agent be compressed in a tablet press. The granulation preferably takes place in a fluidized bed granulator under suitable conditions. It is moreover possible if desired for the active ingredient to be admixed to the other pharmaceutical excipients in the form of a trituration with a pharmaceutical excipient (especially a filler). This is particularly preferred when the active ingredient content in the dosage form is less than 5% by weight.<br>
Such a trituration can normally be obtained by grinding the active ingredient with a pharmaceutical excipient (especially a filler).<br>
12<br><br>
The pharmaceutical preparation can therefore also be produced by a process for producing a dosage form in tablet or pellet form for oral administration of the active ingredient comprising the steps: (a) production of a mixture of active ingredient and pharmaceutical excipients and (b) granulation of the mixture obtained in (a) with an aqueous solution of PVP.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation can also be produced by granulation of a mixture of<br>
(a)	active ingredient, or a trituration of the active ingredient with corn starch,<br>
(b)	corn starch and<br>
(c)	lactose monohydrate<br>
with an aqueous PVP solution, drying of the granules, mixing of the granules with a release agent and compression in a tablet press.<br>
Alternatively, the pharmaceutical preparation can be produced by granulation of a mixture of (a) active ingredient, or a trituration of the active ingredient with corn starch,<br>
(b)	corn starch,<br>
(c)	microcrystalline cellulose and (d) sodiumcarboxymethylstarch with an aqueous PVP solution, drying of the granules, mixing of the granules with a release agent and compression in a tablet press.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation can be produced by granulation of a mixture of pharmaceutical excipients with a suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous PVP solution, drying of the granules and, if desired, admixture of further pharmaceutical excipients. The preparations obtained in this way can then, after mixing with a release agent, be compressed in a tablet press. The granulation preferably takes place in a fluidized bed granulator under suitable conditions.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation can also be produced by a process comprising the steps: (a) production of a mixture of pharmaceutical excipients and (b) granulation of<br>
13<br><br>
the mixture obtained in (a) with a suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous solution of PVP.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparation can be produced by granulation of a mixture of corn starch and lactose monohydrate with a suspension of the active ingredient in an aqueous solution of PVP, drying of the granules, mixing of the granules with a release agent and compression in a tablet press.<br>
The production of pharmaceutical preparation according to the invention is described by way of example below. The following examples explain the invention in more detail without restricting it.<br>
