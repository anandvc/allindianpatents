AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURE OF PYRAZINE DERIVATIVE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an industrial process for the synthesis of 6-(5-chloro-2-pyridinyl)-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine-5-yl-4-methyl piperazine-1 -carboxylate with higher yields and economical feasibility.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
6-(5-Chloro-2-pyridinyl)-6, 7-dihydro-7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine-5-yl-4-methyl<br>
piperazine-1-carboxylate i.e. Zopiclone (I) is a non benzodiazepine, which belongs to the<br>
group of medicines called as the central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Zopiclone, a<br>
cyclopyrrolone derivative, is a short-acting hypnotic agent (Ref: US 5,786,357).<br>
Zopiclone belongs to a novel chemical class, which is structurally unrelated to existing<br>
hypnotics. Zopiclone belongs to the class of pyrrolopyrazine, which is known to possess<br>
hypnotic	properties.	(Ref:	http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/nda/2004/<br>
021476 Lunesta prntlbl.PDF). Zopiclone is used to cure people with insomnia.<br>
1<br><br>
In a racemic compound it is known that one of the two enantiomers is more active. The dextro isomer of Zopiclone (II) is twice as active as the racemate, whereas the laevorotatory isomer is almost inactive. Further, the dextrorotatory isomer also has the lower toxicity as compared to the racemate (Ref: US 6,319,926).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The use and preparation of the optically active isomer of Zopiclone is described in US 6,319, 926 Bl. US 5,786,357 is a patent, which discloses the method of treatment by making use of the (+) enantiomer of Zopiclone. WO2004/037212 and US 2004147521 disclose the preparation of Zopiclone derivatives.<br>
US 3, 862, 149 discloses a process for the preparation of Zopiclone. The reaction sequence includes the reaction of 2-amino-5-chloropyridine and pyrazine 2,3-dicarboxylic acid anhydride at reflux temperature to yield 3-(5-chloropyrid-2-yl) carbomyl pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid. Further, 3-(5-chloropyrid-2-yl) carbomyl pyrazine -2-carboxylic acid is cyclised using thionyl chloride to yield 6-(5- chloropyrid -2-yl)-5,7-dioxo-5,6-dihydropyrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine, which is further treated with potassium borohydride to yield 6-(5- chloropyrid -2-yl)-5-hydroxy-7-oxo-5,6-dihydro pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine. The obtained 6-(5- chloropyrid -2-yl)-5-hydroxy-7-oxo-5,6-dihydro pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine is reacted with l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methylpiperazine using sodium hydride to give 6-(5-chloro-2-pyridinyl)-6,7-dihydro-7-oxo-5H-pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine-5-yl-4-methyl piperazine -1-carboxylate (I), which is purified using column chromatographic technique to get pure Zopiclone.<br>
2<br><br><br><br><br><br>
However, this prior art process has following limitations:<br>
1.	The l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methyl piperazine used is moisture sensitive.<br>
2.	It is also a strong skin irritant.<br>
3.	The use of sodium hydride makes the process hazardous to explosion.<br>
4.	The overall yield of the reaction is low, thus making the process industrially unfeasible.<br>
5.	The purification of the final product is carried out by making use of chromatographic technique and hence the process is not industrially feasible.<br>
US 6,339,086, US 6,506,753 and US 6,458,791 discloses the preparation of Zopiclone as shown in Scheme (I). The compound (III) is reacted with the chiral auxiliary-based chloroformate (IV) to yield compound of formula (V), which is further reacted with base (VI) to yield S-Zopiclone (II). Alternatively, Zopiclone is also prepared as shown in Scheme (II). The amino alcohol (III) is reacted with the ester (VII) in the presence of an enzyme to give compound of formula (VIII), which is further treated with base (VI) to yield S-Zopiclone (II).<br>
.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme (I): Process for preparation of S-Zopiclone as per US 6,339,086<br><br><br>
Scheme (II): Process for preparation of Zopiclone as per US 6,339,086<br>
However, this process has disadvantages, which limit its scope on an industrial scale. The process disclosed in US 6,339,086 makes use of a chiral auxiliary based chloroformate. The chiral auxiliary based chloroformate is not readily available, which needs reaction step(s), to generate the chiral auxiliary based chloroformate. This increases additional number of steps, thus increasing the time cycle, utilities, cost, manpower etc. This chloroformate is difficult to handle and moisture sensitive.<br>
Further, the Scheme (II) makes use of an enzyme in its process, which is industrially not feasible. The cost involved in the enzymatic process is high. Enzyme catalyzed reactions require more lead time for a chemical conversion than the typical conventional chemicals. Enzymes are sensitive to pH, temperature, humidity and contaminants. Storage of these enzymes is more difficult as they have a shorter shelf life than most chemicals. There should be a careful study and planning regarding the availibility of enzymes on hand, as it is not readily available in the market (Ref: http://www.aatcc.org/magazine/files/enzvmes aatccreview.pdf)<br>

US 6,444,673 discloses a process for the resolution of racemic Zopiclone by making use of D (+)-0,0'-dibenzoyltartaric acid and dichloromethane. The crude salt obtained is recrystallised in acetonitrile. The product obtained is further dissolved in dichloromethane and further acetonitrile is added. The final product is recrystallised again to obtain a pure compound. However, this method has following disadvantages:<br>
a)	More steps are required to reach the final purity of the product.<br>
b)	Larger amount of solvents are required. Especially acetonitrile, which is costly solvent, is used in the ratio of 1:18 (Wt/ vol) with respect to the racemic Zopiclone tartarate.<br>
c)	Further as the steps increase, the yield decreases, thus making the process costly.<br>
d)	The time cycle required for the process is also more.<br>
In view of the above shortcomings, it was necessary to develop alternate synthetic route, which would give compound of formula (II) with use of limited volumes of acetonitrile as well as dichloromethane.<br>
The present inventors have developed a synthetic route for preparation of Zopiclone, by a process which not only suppresses the need for complicated purification of racemic Zopiclone, but also gives Zopiclone in good yields.<br>
The present inventors have also made an approach to prepare (S)-Zopiclone by avoiding the highly explosive base sodium hydride.<br>
In the present invention, an approach to prepare (S)-Zopiclone by avoiding the highly moisture sensitive reagent i.e. l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methylpiperazine.<br>
The present inventors have also developed a process for the preparation of (S) Zopiclone of desired purity by reducing the steps, making use of less amount of solvents, reducing the time cycle and thus making the entire process cost effective and industrially feasible.<br>
5<br><br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
First object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of (S)-Zopiclone of formula (II) by a synthetic route, which is novel from the routes disclosed in prior art.<br>
Second object of the invention is to provide (S)-Zopiclone by avoiding the highly moisture sensitive and skin irritating reagent i.e. l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methylpiperazine.<br>
Third object of the invention is to prepare Zopiclone by avoiding the use of sodium hydride, which is explosive and difficult to handle on an industrial scale.<br>
Fourth object of the invention is to provide optically active form of Zopiclone in appreciable yields.<br>
Fifth object of the invention is to provide optically active form of Zopiclone by making use of lesser amount of solvents, especially acetonitrile.<br>
Sixth object of the invention is to provide a simple, industrially feasible, economical and safe method to prepare optically active Zopiclone.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the present invention the optically active Zopiclone is prepared by making use of l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methyl piperazine hydrochloride. The present invention also makes use of less hazardous base. This current embodiment also discloses the resolution of racemic Zopiclone by making use of less amount of solvents especially acetonitrile, thus decreasing the cost and the time cycle of the process.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Optically active Zopiclone i.e. (S)-Zopiclone is prepared as per Scheme (III) disclosed below:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The present embodiment describes the preparation of optically active Zopiclone as per the reaction sequence disclosed in Scheme (III). The reaction sequence includes the reaction of pyrazine-2, 3-dicarboxylic acid anhydride (IX) and 2-amino-5-chloropyridine (X), to yield 3-(5-chloropyrid-2yl) carbomyl pyrazine-2-carboxylic acid (XI). This compound (XI) is cyclised using thionyl chloride to yield 6-(5-chloropyrid-2-yl)-5,7-dioxo-5,6-dihydropyrrolo-[3,4-b]-pyrazine (XII), which is reduced using potassium borohydride to give 6-(5-chloropyrid-2-yl)-5-hydroxy-7-oxo-5,6-dihydro pyrrolo-[3,4-b]-<br>
7<br><br>
pyrazine i.e. (XIII). Further, the compound (XIII) is reacted with l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methylpiperazine hydrochloride (XIV) in the presence of dimethyl amino pyridine and tri ethyl amine to produce racemic Zopiclone (I). This racemic compound is treated with D (+) di-benzoyl tartaric acid to yield the racemic tartarate salt (XV), which on crystallization in the single step using methylene dichloride and acetonitrile yields the (S) (+) Zopiclone tartarate salt (XVI). This optically active tartarate salt is then basified using sodium hydroxide to yield (S) Zopiclone (II).<br>
The current invention makes use of l-chlorocarbonyl-4-methylpiperazine hydrochloride (XIV). This compound is easy to handle. It is less moisture sensitive and is a safe reagent. Further, it also does not cause any skin reactions. The base used in the reaction is 4-dimethyl amino pyridine and triethylamine. This combination of base used, requires less stringent conditions and hence make the reaction conditions less hazardous as compared to the use of sodium hydride, otherwise used for the said reaction.<br>
The current embodiment makes use of a process in which the purification step is faster and quick. A single step crystallization, for resolution of Zopiclone, is carried out, which requires lesser amount of solvents and thus decreases the cost of the entire process. The solvents used in the crystallization step are methylene dichloride and acetonitrile. Methylene dichloride used is in the ratio of 1 : 4 to 1 : 8 wt / vol (w.r.t. wt. of Zopiclone). Acetonitrile used is in the ratio of 1 : 8 to 1 : 12 wt / vol.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, methylene dichloride used is in the ratio of 1 : 4 to 1 : 6 wt / vol (w.r.t. wt. of Zopiclone) and acetonitrile used is in the ratio of 1 : 9 to 1 : 11 wt / vol.<br>
The improved method of crystallization according to the instant invention reduces the load on utilities, reactor occupancy, manpower, time cycle etc. A further result to this is the increase in the yield of the final product.<br>
8<br><br>
Thus, the current embodiment makes use of a process, which is advantageous in following ways:<br>
1)	Use of l-Chlorocarbonyl-4-methylpiperazine hydrochloride, being less moisture sensitive.<br>
2)	Easy to handle.<br>
3)	Avoids skin irritation.<br>
4)	Use of safe and non explosive base.<br>
5)	Cost effective and industrially feasible process.<br>
6)	High yields.<br>
7)	Avoiding use of column chromatography.<br>
8)	Reduction in the time cycle of the process.<br>
