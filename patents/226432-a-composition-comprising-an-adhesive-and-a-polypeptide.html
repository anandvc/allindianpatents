ANALOGUES, ISOFORMS AND OTHER DERIVATIVES<br>
A COMPOSITION COMPRISING AN ADHESIVE AND A POLYPEPTIDE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/458,399, filed March 31, 2003.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[002] The present invention relates to the field of compositions and methods<br>
for delivering polypeptide pharmaceuticals.<br>
Description of the Background Art;<br>
[003] Polypeptide pharmaceuticals can be extremely efficacious agents in the<br>
treatment of various maladies. Since polypeptide pharmaceuticals can be very<br>
expensive to produce, there is a need in the art for improved compositions and,<br>
methods for delivering polypeptide pharmaceuticals.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[004] In accordance with the present invention, a composition comprises a<br>
substantially purified composition including an adhesive and a polypeptide<br>
comprising amino acid sequence LKKTET, or a conservative variant thereof. A<br>
method of delivery of a polypeptide to a site comprises introducing the above<br>
composition to the site.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[005] The present invention provides compositions and methods utilizing<br>
actin-sequestering peptides such as thymosin p4 (Tβ4) and other actin-<br>
sequestering peptides or peptide fragments containing ammo acid sequence<br>
LKKTET or conservative variants thereof. Included are NB or C -terminal variants<br>
such as KLKKTET and LKKTETQ. These peptides and peptide fragments are<br>
useful in promoting wound healing and other physiological uses.<br>
[006] Thymosin p4 was initially identified as a protein that is up-regulated<br>
during endothelial cell migration and differentiation in vitro. Thymosin β4 is a 43<br>
amino acid, 4.9 kDa ubiquitous polypeptide identified in a variety of tissues.<br>
Several roles have been ascribed to this protein including a role in a endothelial<br>
cell differentiation and migration, T cell differentiation, actin sequestration and<br>
vascularization.<br>
[007] Thymosin β4 is a member of the β-thymosin family of highly conserved<br>
polar 5-kDa polypeptides found in various tissues and cell, types. Originally<br>
purified from thymus and regarded as a thymic hormone, thymosin β4 was then<br>
found to be involved in multiple biological processes. As the main G-actin<br>
sequestering peptide, it plays an important role in regulation of actin assembly<br>
during cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Numerous studies<br>
implicate thymosin p4 in regulation of cancerogenesis, inflammation,<br>
angiogenesis, and wound healing. It was found that thymosin β4 expression<br>
regulated tumorigenicity and metastatic activity in malignant cell lines through<br>
actin-based cytoskeletal organization. Thymosin β4 was found to be elevated in<br>
tube forming endothelial cells; it increases their attachment, spreading and<br>
migration thus promoting angiogenesis. Thymosin β4 was also found in ulcer<br><br>
extracts and wound fluids at high concentrations and was suggested to function<br>
as an antibacterial factor. The stimulating role of thymosin β4 in wound healing<br>
was demonstrated in several studies with animal models. When added topically<br>
or administered intraperitoneally, thymosin β4 enhanced dermal wound healing<br>
in a rat full thickness model. The abiliiy to accelerate dermal wound healing has<br>
also been observed in db/db diabetic mice, steroid-immunosuppressed mice and<br>
in aged mice. Thymosin β4 has also been shown to accelerate healing of the<br>
corneal epithelium after burn injuries and to down regulate a number of corneal<br>
cytokines and chemokines reducing the inflammatory response.<br>
[008] Activation of the coagulation cascade upon vascular injury results in<br>
generation of thrombin which converts fibrinogen into fibrin. Fibrin polymerizes<br>
spontaneously to form blood clots which seals damaged places thus preventing<br>
the loss of blood. Fibrin also serves as a provisional matrix on which various cell<br>
types adhere, migrate and proliferate replacing fibrin with normal tissues during<br>
subsequent wound healing processes. Factor XIIIa, a plasma transglutaminase,<br>
covalently cross-links the fibrin clot reinforcing its structure. In addition, it also<br>
cross-links to fibrin a number of physiologically active proteins which may<br>
modulate properties of the fibrin matrix. For example, covalent incorporation of<br>
α2-antiplasmin increases resistance of the matrix to fibrinolysis and<br>
incorporation of fibronectin may affect its ability to support cell adhesion and<br>
migration. Tissue transglutaminase can selectively incorporate into fibrin<br>
thymosin 04.<br>
[009] Thymosin β4 serves as a specific substrate for tissue transglutaminase<br>
and can be selectively cross-linked by it to collagen, actin, fibrinogen and fibrin,<br>
proteins which are also involved in the above mentioned processes. After<br><br><br>
'activation of platelets with thrombin, thymosin β4 is released and cross-linked to<br>
fibrin in a time- and calcium-dependent manner. Platelet factor XIIIa is co-<br>
released from stimulated platelets. Cross-linking of platelet-released thymosin<br>
β4 to fibrin appears to be mediated by factor XIIIa and provides a mechanism to<br>
increase the local concentration of thymosin β4 near sites of clots and tissue<br>
damage, for promotion of wound healing, angiogenesis and inflammatory<br>
response.<br>
[0010] Fibrinogen is a chemical dimer comprising two identical subunits, each<br>
composed of three polypeptide chains, Aα, Bβ and γ held together by a number of<br>
disulfide bonds. The disulfide-linked NH2-tenninal portions of all six chains form<br>
the central E region, while the COOH-terminal portions form two terminal D<br>
regions and two αC-domains. Upon conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin,<br>
thrombin-mediated removal of the NH2-terminal fibrinopeptides A and B from the<br>
fibrinogen and removal of the NH2-terminal fibrinopeptides A and B from the<br>
fibrinogen Aα and Bβ chains, respectively, results in exposure of their active<br>
sequences (polymerization sites) and enables interaction between the E and D<br>
regions of neighboring molecules (DD:E interaction) to form a fibrin polymer. The<br>
polymer becomes cross-linked by factor XIIIa through the COOH-termtnal<br>
portions of the fibrin a and γ chains. The intermolecular cross-finking of the γ<br>
chains of the adjacent D regions occurs rapidly resulting in γ-γ dimers, while<br>
cross-linking between the a polymers (aC-domains) occurs more slowly and<br>
results in formation of α polymers. In addition, the a chains serve for cross-<br>
linking to fibrin of such proteins as fibronectin, α2-antiplasmin, and PAI-2. Thus,<br>
it is tempting to hypothesize that these chains could also be involved in cross-<br>
linking of thymosin β4.<br><br>
[0011] To clarify the mechanism of the incorporation of thymosin β4 into<br>
fibrin(ogen), its interaction was studied with fibrinogen, fibrin and their<br>
recombinant fragments (domains) in the absence and presence of factor XIIIa.<br>
The study revealed that although there appears to be no substantial non-covalent<br>
interaction between fibrin(ogen) and thymosin β4, factor XIIIa efficiently crosslinks<br>
the latter to both fibrinogen and fibrin and that cross-linking occurs mainly<br>
through the COOH-terminal portion of their αC -domains including residues 392-<br>
610.<br>
[0012] In accordance with one embodiment, a substantially purified<br>
composition is provided which includes an adhesive and a polypeptide<br>
comprising amino acid sequence LKKTET or a conservative variant thereof. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the adhesive is capable of adhering to medical<br>
devices such as stents. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the adhesive is<br>
capable of adhering to tissues of a living subject such as a human.<br>
[0013] In preferred embodiments, the adhesive is a biodegradable adhesive.<br>
When used herein, the term biodegradable adhesive is intended to encompass<br>
bioabsorbable or errodable adhesives. In preferred embodiments, the invented<br>
composition initially is in a fluid or semi-fluid state, most preferably in a liquid or<br>
semi-liquid state. In particularly preferred embodiments, after application, the<br>
adhesive increases in viscosity or at least partially solidifies while adhering to the<br>
tissue. The composition may be introduced by applying to an area in a layer,<br>
most preferably by spraying or with a brush.<br>
[0014] In preferred embodiments, the adhesive utilized in the present invention<br>
is a fibrin sealant matrix (fibrin glue). Fibrin glue is a two-component system of<br>
separate solutions of fibrinogen and thrombin/calcium. When the two solutions<br><br>
are combined, the resultant mixture mimics the final stages of the clotting<br>
cascade to form a fibrin clot. The fibrinogen component can be prepared<br>
extemporaneously from autologous, single-donor, or pooled blood. Fibrin glue is<br>
available in Europe under the brand names Beriplast, Tissel, and Tissucol.<br>
Fibrin glue has been used in a wide variety of surgical procedures to repair, seal,<br>
and attach tissues in a variety of anatomic sites.<br>
[0015] Thus, the present invention provides a method of delivering an LKKTET<br>
polypeptide to a site of a living subject. In preferred embodiments, this site is a<br>
surface. The inventive method comprises applying the inventive composition to<br>
the site. In preferred embodiments, the site is a wound, such as an acute or<br>
chronic wound.<br>
[0016] In preferred embodiments, the adhesive is fibrin, fibrinogen, fibrin glue,<br>
a collagen, fragments of any of the above or a mixture of any of the above.<br>
Collagen adhesives which may be utilized include types 1, 2, 3, 4 and/or 5<br>
collagens. Other adhesives may include actin or integrin adhesives.<br>
[0017] Lα other embodiments, the biodegradable adhesive utilized in the<br>
inventive composition is a gel (e.g., adhesive collagen gel), gel/fibrin mixture,<br>
powder or the like.<br>
[0018] In preferred embodiments, the adhesive is covalently bound to the<br>
LKKTET peptide, most preferably by factor XIIIa. In particularly preferred<br>
embodiments, the adhesive is a fragment of fibrin or fibrinogen.<br>
[0019] In preferred embodiments, the LKKTET polypeptide comprises amino<br>
acid sequence KLKKTET or LKKTETQ, Thymosin 04 (Tβ4), an N-terminal variant<br>
of Tβ4, a C-terminal variant of Tβ4, an isoform of Tβ4, a splice-variant of Tβ4,<br>
oxidized Tβ4, Tβ4 sulfoxide, lymphoid Tβ4, pegylated Tβ4 or any other actin<br><br>
sequestering or bundling proteins having actin binding domains, or peptide<br>
fragments comprising or consisting essentially of the amino acid sequence<br>
LKKTET or conservative variants thereof. International Application Serial No.<br>
PCT/US99/17282, incorporated herein by reference, discloses isoforms of Tβ4<br>
which may be useful in accordance with the present invention as well as amino<br>
acid sequence LKKTET and conservative variants thereof, which may be utilized<br>
with the present invention. International Application Serial No.<br>
PCT/GB99/00833 (WO 99/49883), incorporated herein by reference, discloses<br>
oxidized Thymosin β4 which may be utilized in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Although the present invention is described primarily hereinafter with<br>
respect to Tβ4 and Tβ4 isoforms, it is to be understood that the following<br>
description is intended to be equally applicable to amino acid sequence LKKTET,<br>
LKKTETQ, peptides and fragments comprising or consisting essentially of<br>
LKKTET or LKKTETQ, conservative variants thereof, as well as oxidized Thymosin<br>
β4.<br>
[0020] Examples of contacting the damaged site include contacting the site<br>
with a composition comprising adhesive/Tβ4 alone, or in combo with at least one<br>
agent that enhances Tβ4 penetration, or delays or slows release of Tβ4 peptides<br>
into the area to be treated. A subject may be a mammal, preferably human.<br>
[0021] Tβ4, or its analogues, isoforms or derivatives, may be administered in<br>
any suitable effective amount. For example, Tβ4 may be administered in dosages<br>
within the range of about 0.1-50 micrograms of Tβ4, more preferably in amounts<br>
within the range of about 1-25 micrograms.<br>
[0022] A composition in accordance with the present invention can be<br>
administered daily, every other day, etc., with a single administration or multiple<br><br>
administrations per day of administration, such as applications 2, 3, 4 or more<br>
times per day of administration.<br>
[0023] Tβ4 isoforms have been identified and have about 70%, or about 75%,<br>
or about 80% or more homology to the known amino acid sequence of Tβ4. Such<br>
isoforms include, for example, Tβ4ala, Tβ9, Tβ10, Tβ11, Tβ12, Tβ13, Tβ14 and<br>
Xβ15. Similar to Tβ4, the Tβ10 and Tβ15 isoforms, as well as the Tβ4 splice-<br>
variants, have been shown to sequester actin. Tβ4, Tβ10 and Tp15, as well as<br>
these other isoforms share an amino acid sequence, LKKTET, that appears to be<br>
involved in mediating actin sequestration or binding. Although not wishing to be<br>
bound to any particular theory, the activity of Tβ4 isoforms may be due, in part,<br>
to the ability to regulate the polymerization of actin. β-thymosins appear to<br>
depoh/merize F-actin by sequestering free G-actin. Tβ4's ability to modulate actin<br>
polymerization may therefore be due to all, or in part, its ability to bind to or<br>
sequester actin via the LKKTET sequence. Thus, as with Tβ4, other proteins<br>
which bind or sequester actin, or modulate actin polymerization, including Tβ4<br>
isoforms having the amino acid sequence LKKTET, are likely to be effective, alone<br>
or in a combination with Tβ4, as set forth herein.<br>
[0024] Thus, it is specifically contemplated that known Tβ4 isoforms, such as<br>
TΒ4aim, Tβ9, Tβ10, Tβ11, Tβ12, Tβ13, Tβ14 and Tβ15, as well as Tβ4 isoforms and<br>
Tβ4 splice-variants not yet identified, will be useful in the methods of the<br>
invention. As such Tβ4 isoforms are useful in the methods of the invention,,<br>
including the methods practiced in a subject. The invention therefore further<br>
provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising Tβ4, as well as Tβ4 isoforms<br>
Tβ4ala, Tβ9, Tβ10, Tβ11, Tβ12, Tβ13, Tβ14 and Tβ15, and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier.<br><br>
[0025] In addition, other proteins having actin sequestering or binding<br>
capability, or that can mobilize actin or modulate actin polymerization, as<br>
demonstrated in an appropriate sequestering, binding, mobilization or<br>
polymerization assay, or identified by the presence of an amino acid sequence<br>
that mediates actin binding, such as LKKTET, for example, can similarly be<br>
employed in the methods of the invention. Such proteins include gelsolin,<br>
vitamin D binding protein (DBP), profilin, cofilin, adsevertin, propomyosin,<br>
fincilin, depactin, Dnasel, villin, fragmin, severin, capping protein, β-actinin and<br>
acumentin, for example. As such methods include those practiced in a subject,<br>
the invention further provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising gelsolin,<br>
vitamin D binding protein (DBP), profilin, cofilin, depactin, Dnasel, villin,<br>
fragmin, severin, capping protein, β-actinin and acumentin as set forth herein.<br>
Thus, the invention includes the use of a polypeptide comprising the amino acid<br>
sequence LKKTET (which may be within its primary amino acid sequence) and<br>
conservative variants thereof.<br>
[0026] As used herein, the term "conservative variant" or grammatical<br>
variations thereof denotes the replacement of an amino acid residue by another,<br>
biologically similar residue. Examples of conservative variations include the<br>
replacement of a hydrophobic residue such as isoleucine, valine, leucine or<br>
methionine for another, the replacement of a polar residue for another, such as<br>
the substitution of arginine for lysine, glutamic for aspartic acids, or glutamine<br>
for asparagine, and the like.<br>
[0027] Tβ4 has been localized to a number of tissue and cell types and thus,<br>
agents which stimulate the production of Tβ4 can be added to or comprise a<br>
composition to effect Tβ4 production from a tissue and/or a cell. Such agents<br><br>
include members of the family of growth factors, such as insulin-like growth<br>
factor (IGF-1), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor<br>
(EGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), basic fibroblast growth factor<br>
(bFGF), thymosin al (Tα 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). More<br>
preferably, the agent is transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) or other<br>
members of the TGF-β superfamily.<br>
[0028] Additionally, agents that assist or stimulate healing may be added to a<br>
composition along with Tβ4 or a Tβ4 isoform. Such agents include angiogenic<br>
agents, growth factors, agents that direct differentiation of cells. For example,<br>
and not by way of limitation, Tβ4 or a Tβ4 isoform alone or in combination can be<br>
added in combination with any one or more of the following agents: VEGF, KGF,<br>
FGF, PDGF, TGFβ, IGF-1, IGF-2, IL-1, prothymosin α and thymosin α11 in an<br>
effective amount.<br>
[0029] The actual dosage, formulation or composition that heals or prevents<br>
inflammation, damage and degeneration may depend on many factors, including<br>
the size and health of a subject. However, persons of ordinary skill in the art can<br>
use teachings describing the methods and techniques for determining clinical<br>
dosages as disclosed in PCT/US99/17282, supra, and the references cited<br>
therein, to determine the appropriate dosage to use.<br>
[0030] In preferred embodiments, the concentration of the polypeptide is within<br>
a range of about 0.01-1 mole of the polypeptide per mole of the adhesive, more<br>
preferably within a range of about 0.1-0.5 mole of the polypeptide per mole of the<br>
adhesive, most preferably within a range of about 0.2-0.4 mole of the polypeptide<br>
per mole of the adhesive.<br><br>
[0031] Suitable formulations may include Tβ4 or a Tβ4 isoform at a<br>
concentration within the range of about 0.001 - 10% by weight, within the range<br>
of about 0.01 - 0.1% by weight, or even about 0.05% by weight.<br>
[0032] The invention includes use of antibodies which interact with Tβ4<br>
peptide or functional fragments thereof. Antibodies which consists essentially of<br>
pooled monoclonal antibodies with different epitopic specificities, as well as<br>
distinct monoclonal antibody preparations are provided. Monoclonal antibodies<br>
are made from antigen containing fragments of the protein by methods well<br>
known to those skilled in the art as disclosed in PCT/US99/17.282, supra. The<br>
term antibody as used in this invention is meant to include monoclonal and<br>
polyclonal antibodies.<br>
[0033] In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of treating<br>
a subject by administering an effective amount of an agent which modulates Tβ4<br>
gene expression. The term "modulate" refers to inhibition or suppression of Tβ4<br>
expression when Tβ4 is over expressed, and induction of expression when Tβ4 is<br>
under expressed. The term "effective amount" means that amount of Tβ4 agent<br>
which is effective in modulating Tβ4 gene expression resulting in effective<br>
treatment. An agent which modulates Tβ4 or Tβ4 isoform gene expression may<br>
be a polynucleotide for example. The polynucleotide may be an antisense, a<br>
triplex agent, or a ribozyme. For example, an antisense directed to the structural<br>
gene region or to the promoter region of Tβ4 may be utilized.<br>
[0034] In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for utilizing<br>
compounds that modulate Tβ4 activity. Compounds that affect Tβ4 activity (e.g.,<br>
antagonists and agonists) include peptides, peptidomimetics, polypeptides,<br>
chemical compounds, minerals such as zincs, and biological agents.<br><br><br>
[0035] While not be bound to any particular theory, the present invention may<br>
promote healing or prevention of inflammation or damage by inducing terminal<br>
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (a non-template directed DNA polymerase), to<br>
decrease the levels of one or more inflammatory cytokines, or chemokines, and to<br>
act as a chemotactic factor for endothelial cells, and thereby promoting healing or<br>
preventing degenerative changes in tissue brought about by injury or other<br>
degenerative or environmental factors.<br>
[0036] The invention is further illustrated by the following example, which is<br>
not to be construed as limiting.<br>
Example<br>
Proteins and Reagents<br>
[0037] Human fibrinogen depleted of plasminogen, fibronectin and von<br>
Willebrand factor was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South<br>
Bend, IN). The recombinant αC-fragment corresponding to the human fibrinogen<br>
αC-domain (residues Aα221-610) and its truncated variants corresponding to the<br>
NH2 and COOH-terminal halves (residues Aα221-391 and Aα392-610,<br>
respectively) were produced in E. coli using the pET20b expression vector. The<br>
recombinant γ-module comprising residues 148-411 of the human fibrinogen γ<br>
chain was produced in E.coli using the same expression vector.<br>
[0038] Bovine thrombin (1,000 NIHu/mg, aprotinin (4.4 TIU/mg), antirabbit<br>
IgG-horseradish conjugate and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) were purchased<br>
from Sigma. Recombinant factor XIII was provided as a gift by Zymogenetics,<br>
Inc. (Seattle, WA). Synthetic thymosin β4 was provided as a gift by Regenerx<br><br>
Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Bethesda, MD). Anti-thymosin β4 serum was prepared<br>
according to published methods.<br>
Activation of factor XIII.<br>
[0039] Factor XII in 25 mM Tris buffer, pH 8.0, with . 15 M NaCl (TBS), was<br>
activated either with thrombin or with CaCl2, the latter was made to avoid the<br>
presence of thrombin which could potentially activate fibrinogen. Thrombin-<br>
activated FFXIII [FXIIIa(THr)] was made by addition of bovine thrombin to final<br>
concentrations of 25 NIH u/ml and 2.5 CaCl2 mM. Ca2+-activated thrombin<br>
[FXIIIa(Ca)] was made by addition of CaCl2 to final concentration of 50 mM. Final<br>
concentration of FXIII in both mixtures was 1.5 mg/ml; both mixture were<br>
incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior experiments.<br>
Labeling of thymosin β4 with FITC<br>
[0040] Fluorescence labeled thymosin β4 was prepared by the reaction with<br>
fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Thymosin β4 was transferred in 0.1 M NaHCO3<br>
buffer, pH 9.5, by gel-filtration on NAP5 Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham<br>
Biosciences) followed by addition of a 1.2 molar excess of FITC and incubation of<br>
the mixture at 37ºC for 2 h in the dark. Non-reacted FITC was removed on NAP5<br>
column. The degree of labeling determined spectrophotometrically as described<br>
was found to be 0.9 mole of FITC per mole of thymosin β4.<br>
Solid-phase Binding Assay<br>
[0041] The interaction between thymosin β4 and fibrin(ogen) and its fragments<br>
in the presence or absence of FXIIIa was studies by ELISA using plastic microliter<br>
plates. Wells of microliter plates were coated overnight at -4°C with fibrinogen<br><br><br>
and fibrin at 10 μg/mL or with the recombinant fragments of 20 μg/ml, all in 0.1<br>
M NaHCO3 buffer, pH 8.3. Fibrin was made by addition to the wells of a mixture<br>
containing 10 μg/mL fibrinogen 1 NIH u/ml thrombin and 400 u/ml aprotinin,<br>
followed by overnight incubation at +4°C. The wells were then blocked by<br>
incubation with Super Blocker (Pierce) at 37ºC for 1 h. Following washing with<br>
TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBS-Tween), the indicated concentrations of<br>
thymosin β4, FXIII, FXIIIa(Thr) and FXIIIa(Ca) were added to the wells and<br>
incubated for 2-2.5 h at 37°C. Bound (incorporated) thymosin β4 was detected<br>
by the reaction with rabbit anti-thymosin β4 serum and peroxidase-conjugated<br>
anti-rabbit IgG. A TMB Microwell Peroxidase Substrase was added to the wells,<br>
and the incorporated thymosin β4was measured spectrophotometrically at 450<br>
nm.<br>
Incorporation of thymosin β4 into fibrinogen and fibrin<br>
[0042] Reactions of incorporation of FITC-labeled and unlabeled thymosin β4<br>
into fibrinogen and fibrin were performed in Eppendorf tubes containing a<br>
mixture of fibrinogen at 3 mg/mL (9μM) and thymosin β4 or FITC-labeled<br>
thymosin β4 at 150 μg/L (30 μM) in 100 μLTBS with 2.5 mM CaCl2. The<br>
reactions were initiated by addition of FXIIIa(Ca) or FXIIIa(Thr) to final<br>
concentration of 30 μg/mL. The final concentration of thrombin in the<br>
FXIIIa(Thr)-containing mixtures was made at 2.5 NIH u/mL, sufficient to rapidly<br>
form fibrin clot which was observed visually. The reactions with FITC-labeled<br>
thymosin β4 lasted for 4 hours at 37ºC in the dark and were stopped by heat<br>
inactiviation of the enzymes in boiling water for 5 min during fibrinogen and<br>
fibrin denatured and precipitated. The pellets were centrifuged and washed 3<br><br><br>
times in TBS and then solubilized. The amounts of fibrinogen) and FITC-labeled<br>
thymosin β4 in the solubilized pellet were determined spertrophotomertrically<br>
using absorption molar coefficients E280,196 = 15.0 and ε495 = 72,000 M-1cm-1,<br>
respectively. To prepare samples with unlabeled thymosin β4 for analysis by<br>
SDS-PAGE and Western blot the reaction mixtures at the indicated time were<br>
heat-inactivated as above and solubilized by addition of sample buffer<br>
(Invitrogen) containing SDS and reducing agent.<br>
Kinetic Analysis<br>
[0043] To analyze kinetics of the incorporation of thymosin β4 into different<br>
fibrinogen) fragments, they were immobilized onto the wells of microliter plates<br>
(as described above, except that the concentration of all fragments was 20<br>
μg/mL) and incubated with several concentrations of thymosin β4 in the<br>
presence of 10 μg/L thrombin-activated factor XIIIa. The incubation mixtures<br>
were inhibited every 15 min during 1 hour of incubation by the addition of<br>
iodacetamide to final concentration 10 mM incorporated thymosin β4 at each<br>
time point was detected with rabbit anti-thymosin β4 serum as described above.<br>
The initial rates of the reaction of incorporation (V) at different concentrations of<br>
thymosin β4 were determined from the slopes of the reaction time course plots<br>
and expressed as tangent α - A450/t (min), where A450 represents absorbance at<br>
450 nm in optical units (o.u) which is proportional to the amount of incorporated<br>
thymosin β4. Apparent Michaelis constants, Km, were obtained from Lineweaver-<br>
Burk plots, 1/V (min/o.u.) versus 1/[S](μM-1), where [S] is concentration of<br>
thymosin β4.<br><br><br>
Western Blot Analysis<br>
[0044] Detection of thymosin β4 incorporated into fibrinogen) and its<br>
fragments was performed as follows. The samples prepared as described above<br>
were electrophoresed and electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane<br>
(Invitrogen) as described earlier. The membrane was blocked with a casein<br>
blocker for 1 hour and thymosin β4 was detected by the reaction with rabbit anti-<br>
thymosin β4 serum and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG. Visualization of<br>
the peroxidase-labeled protein bands was performed by the procedure<br>
recommended by the manufacturer using a supersignal west pico<br>
chemiluminescent substrate.<br>
ELISA-detected Incorporation of thymosin β4 into Fibrinogen and Fibrin<br>
[0045] To test that factor XIIIa could mediate cross-Unking of thymosin β4 to<br>
flbrin(ogen), and to clarify the mechanism of such cross-Unking we performed a<br>
direct study of the interaction of thymosin β4 with fibrinogen and fibrin in the<br>
presence and absence of recombinant factor XIII. It should be noted that the<br>
recombinant factor comprises two a subunits (a2), in contrast to plasma factor<br>
XIII corresponds to the platelet form of factor XIII.<br>
[0046] In ELISA experiments, when thymosin β4 at 150 μg/mL (30 μm) was<br>
incubated with immobilized fibrinogen, only a low signal was observed in the<br>
absence of factor XIII as well as in the presence of non-activated factor XIII<br>
suggesting that the interaction between them is very weak, if any. When<br>
thymosin β4 was incubated with immobilized fibrin in the absence or presence of<br>
non-activated factor XIIIa, which was activated by the addition of CaCl2 to avoid<br>
conversion of fibrinogen into fibrin in the wells, the signal substantially increased<br><br><br>
suggesting that factor XIIIa mediates binding (incorporation) of thymosin β4into<br>
fibrinogen. A similar situation was observed with immobilized fibrin except that<br>
the level of the incorporation was higher than that into fibrinogen. The<br>
incorporation in both cases was dose-dependent. The incorporation onto fibrin<br>
was further increased when factor XIII was activated with thrombin instead of<br>
Ca3+. Such differences could be due to different specific activities of these two<br>
factor XIIIa species. These results indicate that, activated XIII, similarly to tissue<br>
transglutaminase, mediates incorporation of thymosin β4into both fibrinogen<br>
and fibrin. They also suggest that there is no significant non-covalent interaction<br>
thymosin β4 and both fibrinogen and fibrin.<br>
Further analysis of the incorporation of thymosin β4 into fibrinogen and fibrin<br>
[0047] To further characterize factor XIIIa-mediated incorporation of thymosin<br>
β4 into fibrin(ogen), a mixture was analyzed of thrombin, factor XIII, thymosin β4 and fibrin at different time points by immunoblotting. The mixture and the<br>
samples for analysis were prepared as described in Experimental Procedures.<br>
The samples were electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and probed<br>
with anti- thymosin β4 serum. The results of immunobilizing indicate that factor<br>
XIIIa incorporates thymosin β4 into fibrin covalently, like tissue<br>
transglutaminase, and that the amount of the incorporated (cross-linked)<br>
thymosin β4 seems to reach saturation after 4 hours. This time was selected to<br>
evaluate the degree of the incorporation. For this purpose thymosin β4 was<br>
labeled with a FITC chromophore group which enabled its direct measurement in<br>
fibrinogen/ thymosin β4 and fibrin/ thymosin β4 mixtures. Such modification<br>
did not influence its incorporation into either fibrinogen or fibrin based on the<br><br><br>
pattern of incorporation revealed by Western blot analysis. A similar mixture as<br>
above but with FITC-labeled thymosin β4 was incubated for 4 hours after which<br>
the degree of incorporation was estimated base don the spectrophotometrically<br>
determined amounts of fibrin(ogen) and incorporated FITC- thymosin β4 in each<br>
sample. The results revealed that at the selected conditions, which include<br>
physiological concentration of fibrinogen (9 μM), factor XIIIa incorporated a<br>
substantial amount of FITC- thymosin β4, about 0.2 and 0.4 moles per mole of<br>
fibrinogen and fibrin, respectively.<br>
Incorporation of thymosin β4 into individual fibrin(ogen) chains<br>
[0048] To establish which of the three fibrin(ogen) chains are involved in cross-<br>
linking with thymosin β4, we analyzed the time course of factor XIIIa-mediated<br>
cross-linking of fibrinogen and fibrin in the presence and absence of thymosin β4<br>
by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. It is well known that in fibrin factor XIIIa cross-<br>
links rapidly the COOH-terminal portions of the γ chains to produce γ-γ dimers<br>
followed by cross-linking of the a chains to form α-a dimers, trimers, and copolymers;<br>
fibrinogen is cross-linked in a similar way but at a slower rate. When<br>
analyzed by SDS-APGE in reducing conditions, the bands corresponding to the<br>
individual polypeptide chains of fibrinogen and fibrin, Aα, Bβ, γ and α, β, γ,<br>
respectively, were well resolved. Incubation of fibrinogen with factor XIIIa<br>
resulted in progressive depletion of the band corresponding to the γ-γ dimers and<br>
the Aα-Aα dimers and trimers; the appearance of some material at the start<br>
which most probably corresponds to the Aα polymers was also observed. When<br>
fibrinogen was incubated with factor XIIIa in the presence of thymosin β4, no<br>
substantial difference in the intensity of the bands corresponding to the<br><br><br>
individual chains and their cross-linked variants was found. Similar results were<br>
obtained with fibrin except that the cross-linking of its α and γ chains occurred<br>
more rapidly, as expected, and the amount of the material at the start was<br>
higher. Subsequent Western blot experiments revealed that after 30 min of<br>
incubation substantial amount of thymosin β4 was incorporated into fibrinogen<br>
Aα chain and that after 150 min of incubation some thymosin β4 was also<br>
incorporated into the Aα-Aα dimer. The incorporation of thymosin β4 into fibrin<br>
α chain and the α-α dimer was much more rapid and after 150 min of incubation<br>
material of thymosin β4 was also observed in higher molecular mass forms of the<br>
a chain (α polymers). These results indicate that the fibrinogen Aα and fibrin α<br>
chains contain the major sites for covalent incorporation of thymosin β4. At the<br>
same time the appearance after 150 min of incubation of a low intensity band<br>
with the mobility between that of the γ-γ and α-α dimers suggests that thymosin<br>
β4 could also be incorporated into the fibrin γ chains (γ-γ dimer). Alternatively,<br>
this band may correspond to a proteolytically truncated variant of the α-α dimer.<br>
Incorporation of thymosin β4 into recombinant fibrin(ogen) fragments<br>
[0049] It is well established that the COOH-terminal proteins of the fibrinogen<br>
Aα and γ chains forming the αC domain and γ-module contain reactive Gin and<br>
Lys residues which are cross-linked by factor XIIIa in fibrin and therefore could<br>
potentially be involved in cross-linking with thymosin β4. To test this and to<br>
further localize the cross-linking sites for thymosin β4 in fibrin(ogen), was<br>
analyzed incorporation of thymosin β4 into the recombinant γ-module (residues<br>
γl48-411) and the aC-domain (Aa221-391 and Aa392-610 sub-fragments, by<br>
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Incubation of the aC-domain and the γ-module<br><br><br>
with factor XIIIa in the presence of thymosin β4 resulted in effective cross-linking<br>
and appearance of their appearance of their higher molecular mass forms,<br>
dimers, trimers and oligomers. At the same time, the cross-linking of the Aα221-<br>
391 and Aα392-610 sub-fragments, which contain mainly acceptor Gln and<br>
donor Lys residues, respectively, was much less effective. When the samples<br>
were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-<br>
thymosin β4 serum, substantial amounts of thymosin β4 were detected in the<br>
αC-domain, the γ-module and their higher molecular mass variants, dimers,<br>
trimers and oligomers. The incorporation into the Aα392-610 sub-fragment<br>
monomer and oligomers was also substantial while only very small amount of<br>
thymosin β4 was detected in the Aα221-391 oligomers. These results suggest<br>
that thymosin β4 could be cross-linked to both the αC-domain and the γ-module,<br>
and that the reactive Lys residues of the Aα392-610 region of the former are<br>
involved in the cross-linking.<br>
[0050] The above observations were confirmed by ELISA. When thymosin β4<br>
was incubated with the immobilized γ-module or the αC-domain variants in the<br>
presence of factor XIIIa, it was incorporated effectively into the γ-module and into<br>
the αC-domain ad the Aα392-610 sub-fragment while the incorporation into<br>
αC221-391 was very low. It should be noted that the incorporation of the γ-<br>
module was almost twice lower than that of the αC-domain variants at all<br>
concentration studied. When thymosin β4 was incubated with the same<br>
immobilized species in the presence of non-activated factor XIII or without it, the<br>
incorporation was very low in all cases. This suggests that, as in the case with<br><br>
fibrinogen and fibrin, there is no significant non-covalent interaction between<br>
thymosin β4 and the recombinant fragments.<br>
[0051] It was previously shown that factor XIIIa cross-linking of the γ chains of<br>
fibrin exhibits apparent Michaelis behavior. Assuming that factor XIIIa behaves<br>
as a Michawlis enzyme when cross-linking thymosin β4 to the immobilized y-<br>
module and αC-domain variants one could determine the kinetic parameters of<br>
such cross-linking. The analysis of the kinetic data revealed the following values<br>
of apparent Michaelis constants (Km) for the reaction of incorporation, 183 + 29<br>
μM for the incorporation of thymosin β4 into the γ-module, and 17.6 + 2.5 μM<br>
and 8.6 ± 3.7 μM for that into the αC-domain and its Aα392-610 sub-fragment,<br>
respectively. The much higher Km, value for the γ-module than those for the αC-<br>
domain and its sub-fragment indicates that the cross-linking of thymosin β4 to<br>
the αC-domain variants is much more efficient. In this connection, the Km for the<br>
Aα392-610 fragment is comparable to the Km = 6.2 μM determined previously for<br>
the factor XIIIa-mediated γ-γ cross-linking. The two-fold difference in the Km<br>
values for the αC-domain and the Aα392-610 sub-fragment could be explained by<br>
competition between reactive Gin residues of thymosin β4 and the αC392-610<br>
region, i.e., between αC-to-αC and thymosin β4-to-αC cross-linking. In<br>
agreement, the double-reciprocal, plot for the αC-domain and the Aα3962-610<br>
sub-fragment exhibits a pattern characteristic for competitive inhibition.<br>
[0052] Altogether, the results indicted that factor XIIIa effectively cross-links<br>
thymosin β4 to the COOH-terminal portion of the isolated αC-domain including<br>
residues αC3962-610, that the incorporation into the isolated γ-module is less<br><br>
effective, and that in fibrinogen or fibrin the incorporation occurs mainly in the<br>
αC-domains.<br>
[0053] Fibrin(ogen) plays an important role in wound healing through<br>
interactions with physiologically active proteins and cell receptors. Particularly,<br>
the fibrin matrix stimulates an inflammatory response and capillary tube<br>
formation by endothelial cells (angiogenesis), which are essential steps in the<br>
wound healing process, through interaction with the leukocyte integrin Mac-1<br>
and endothelial cell receptor VE-cadherin, respectively; It also interacts with<br>
high affinity with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial<br>
growth factor (VEGF) providing co-localization of these potent stimulators of<br>
angiogenesis at sites of fibrin deposition and their contribution to wound healing.<br>
Fibrin can also retain at insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFPB-3),<br>
which forms a complex with IGF-1. Thymosin β4, a potent angiogenic and wound<br>
healing factor, can also be incorporated into fibrin by tissue transglutaminase<br>
and apparently further increase the wound healing potential of fibrin matrix.<br>
[0054] Although all transglutaminases catalyze the same reaction, formation of<br>
covalent γ-glutamyl-€-lysyl isopeptide bonds between reactive Gin and Lys<br>
residues, their specificity towards substrates may differ. For example, while<br>
factor XIIIa, a plasma transglutaminase, specifically cross-links in fibrin the γ<br>
and α chains resulting in the γ-γ dimers and α-polymers, respectively, tissue<br>
transglutaminase is less specific and can also generate α-γ chains cross-links.<br>
The cross-linking patterns for the serine protease inhibitor (serpin), PAI-2, to<br>
fibrin(ogen) were also found to be different for tissue transglutaminase and factor<br>
XIIIa. It was originally shown that thymosin β4 is incorporated into fibrin by<br>
guinea pig liver tissue transglutaminase; its incorporation into fibrin by factor<br><br><br>
XIIIa was hypothesized based on the facts that thrombin-activated platelets co-<br>
release factor XIII and thymosin β4 and that the latter becomes cross-linked to<br>
fibrin. In this study it was demonstrated directly that thymosin β4 is<br>
incorporated by factor XIIIa to both fibrinogen and fibrin. Furthermore, it was<br>
found that the degree of the incorporation is rather high, 0.2 and 0.4 mole of<br>
thymosin β4 per mole of fibrinogen and fibrin, respectively. Since concentration<br>
of fibrinogen in plasma is about 9 μM, local concentration of fibrin at places of<br>
fibrin deposition should be much higher. Taking into account that thymosin β4<br>
exhibits its proangiogenic activity at 0.1 nM-1 μM, such degree of incorporation is<br>
obviously physiologically significant and should be sufficient to increase the<br>
wound healing potential of fibrin clot.<br>
[0055] It is known that factor XIIIa incorporates into fibrin a number of plasma<br>
proteins, α2-antiplasmin, PAI-2, fibronectin, thrombospondin, and von Willebrand<br>
factor. The mechanism of incorporation is established only for some of them.'<br>
For example, fibronectin binds to the fibrin αC-domains non-covalently with high<br>
affinity prior to covalent cross-linking with factor XIIIa; the recognition sites and<br>
the reactive Gln and Lys residues in each protein are located in different regions<br>
providing proper orientation of the cross-linking sites. In addition, factor XIIIa<br>
interacts with the αC-domains further increasing the specificity of the reaction.<br>
To test whether non-covalent binding of thymosin β4 precedes its cross-linking to<br>
fibrin, its interaction was studied with immobilized fibrinogen and fibrin in the<br>
presence and absence of non-activated factor XIII. In contrast to other<br>
proangiogenic factors such as bFGF and VEGF, which exhibit high affinity to<br>
fibrin, no noticeable non-covalent interaction was observed with thymosin β4 in<br>
all cases. The incorporation was observed only in the presence of activated factor<br><br><br>
XIIIa suggesting that the covalent cross-linking may be the only mechanism to<br>
retain thymosin β4 in fibrin clot.<br>
[0056] The results clearly indicate that although thymosin β4 could be<br>
incorporated by factor XIIIa into the isolated γ-module and the αC-domain<br>
variants, in fibrin(ogen) it is cross-linked mainly to the αC-domains, namely to<br>
their Aα392-610 regions. The analysis of distribution of the identified reactive<br>
Lys and Gln residues in thymosin β4 and fibrin(ogen) provides a reasonable<br>
explanation for this finding. Thymosin β4 contains a reactive amine donor,<br>
Lys38, and two amine receptors, Gln23 and Gln36, which could be involved in<br>
the cross-linking reaction with other proteins. There are only two reactive<br>
residues in the γ chain involved in the intermolecular γ-γ cross-linking, Gln398<br>
(or G In399) and Lys406, both located in the γ-module. When the isolated y-<br>
module was treated with factor XIIIa, the cross-linking seemed to occur randomly<br>
resulting in dimers, trimers/oligorners; thymosin β4 was incorporated in all these<br>
species. In fibrin, these regions are aligned by the DD:E interactions in an<br>
antiparallel manner facilitating cross-linking between Gln398/399 of one chain<br>
and Lys406 of another to form γ-γ dimers. The efficiency of this cross-linking<br>
reaction is much higher than that between these residues and thymosin β4, and<br>
therefore it is not surprising that little or no incorporation of thymosin β4 into the<br>
fibrin γ chains was observed in this study.<br>
[0057] In contrast to the γ chain, the Aα chain contains multiple reactive<br>
glutamine and lysine residues. The following residues were found to be involved<br>
in the cross-linking between the α chains in fibrin or the recombinant αC-<br>
domains, Gln221, 237, 328 and 366, and Lys508, 539, 556, 580 and 601. The<br>
Aα chain Lys303 was shown to serve as amine donor in factor XIIIa-mediated<br><br><br>
cross-linking of the serpin α2-antiplasmia to fibrin(ogen). This Lys is not reactive<br>
towards another serpin, PAI-2, which is cross-linked by tissue transglutaminase<br>
and factor XIIIa through other Aα chain lysine residues, 148, 176, 183, 230, 413<br>
and 457. The study with a synthetic peptide mimicking the cross-linking region<br>
of α2-antiplasmm revealed that it is incorporated into fibrin a chain through 12<br>
reactive lysine residues, Lys418, 448, 508, 539, 556 and 580, which accounted<br>
for 78% of the total activity, and less reactive Lys208, Lys219 and/or 224,<br>
Lys427, 429, 601 and 606. At least 10 lysine residues within fibrin(ogen) Aα368-<br>
610 region were implicated in cross-linking reactions with fibronectin. The above<br>
analysis indicates that most of the identified reactive residues in fibrin are<br>
located in its αC-domains, that the 392-610 region of the αC-domain, to which<br>
thymosin β4 is a preferentially cross-linked, contains at least 11 reactive Lys<br>
residues, and that among these residues only half is utilized in the α-α cross-<br>
linking. It also suggests that although thymosin β4 could compete for reactive<br>
lysine residues involved in the α-α cross-linking, its cross-linking to the αC-<br>
domains may occur independently of their intermolecular α-α cross-linking<br>
providing its efficient incorporation into fibrin. Thus the reactive lysine residues<br>
of the αC-domains not only serve for the a-across-linkmg but also simultaneously<br>
accommodate physiologically active proteins, including thymosin. β4, which could<br>
modulate properties of fibrin matrix contributing to wound healing and other<br>
physiological and pathological processes.<br>
[0058] Fibrinogen polymerizes in a controllable fashion to make a clot which<br>
easily adheres to different cells and is non-immunogenic and biodegradable.<br>
These make it an ideal hemostatic and bioadhesive (fibrin sealant) that has been<br>
used increasingly in numerous surgical applications as an hemostatic agent for<br><br><br>
the arrest of bleeding, and to assist tissue sealing and wound healing. The use of<br>
fibrin sealants in wound healing and other therapies can be enhanced by<br>
including bioactive agents. For example, it was shown in cellular and animal<br>
models that fibrin can serve as a vehicle for localized delivery of antibiotics and<br>
growth factors. While antibiotics encapsulated by fibrin are released slowly due<br>
to low solubility, the retention of growth factors in fibrin sealants was achieved<br>
through their high affinity interaction with fibrin, or through their direct covalent<br>
cross-linking to it. The ability of thymosin β4 to be incorporated into fibrin(ogen)<br>
by cross-linking with factor XIIIa could be used for its immobilization on fibrin<br>
sealants. This study demonstrates high efficiency of such incorporation into<br>
both fibrinogen and fibrin, supporting this approach.<br>
[0059] In summary, experimental studies confirm that thymosin β4, a bioactive<br>
peptide, could be Incorporated into fibrin by covalently cross-linking with factor<br>
XIIIa, demonstrated high efficiency of its incorporation into both fibrinogen and<br>
fibrin at physiological concentrations of the components, and localized the<br>
incorporation sites within the Aα392-610 region of the fibrin(ogen) αC-domains.<br>
Experimental data supports incorporation of physiologically significant amounts<br>
of thymosin β4 into fibrin sealants for delivery to places of wound healing.<br>
[0060] Tissue transglutaminase and presumably plasma transglutaminase,<br>
factor XIIIa, can covalently incorporate into fibrin(ogen) a physiologically active<br>
peptide, thymosin β4. To clarify the mechanism of this incorporation interaction<br>
was studied of thymosin β4 with fibrinogen, fibrin, and their recombinant<br>
fragments, the γ-module (γ chain residues 148-411), and the αC-domain (Aα<br>
chain residues 221-610) and its truncated variants by immunoblot and ELISA.<br>
No significant non-covalent interaction between them was detected in the<br><br><br>
absence of activated factor XIII while in its presence thymosin β4 was effectively<br>
incorporated into fibrin and to a lesser extent into fibrinogen. The incorporation<br>
at physiological concentrations of fibrin(ogen) and factor XIII was significant with<br>
molar incorporation ratios of thymosin β4 to fibrinogen and fibrin of 0.2 and 0.4, respectively. Further experiments revealed that although activated factor XIII<br>
incorporates thymosin β4 into the isolated γ-module and αC-domain, in fibrin the<br>
latter serves as the major incorporation site. This site was further localized to<br>
the COOH-terminal portion of the αC-domain including residues 392-610.<br><br>
