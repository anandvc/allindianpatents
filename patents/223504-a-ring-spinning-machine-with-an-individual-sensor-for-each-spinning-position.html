Sensor-System for Ring Spinning Machine<br>
The present invention concerns a sensor system for a ring spinning machine, in particular one with a ring rail. The sensor system can be conceived, and be laid out respectively, for detecting so-called "crawling spindles" and can be coordinated to a corresponding display means.<br>
The present invention advantageously is applied in combination with the invention according to the EP patent application No. 00810364.00 filed April 28, 2000. The ring rail can be provided with a support member arranged transversely with respect to a ring carrier member which according to the DE-A-1 43 24 587.0 (Obj. No. 2338) takes up a rail which supports rings restraining the thread balloon. The ring rail furthermore can be provided with openings ac-cording to DE-A-195 42 802 (Obj. 2526). A design layout of this type is not relevant for the present invention but it serves for the explanation in the following of an example of practical application of a system according to the pre-sent invention.<br>
State of the Art<br>
An overview of the basic solutions known for the sensor systems on ring spinning machines is described in the article "Sensoren fur Fadenwachter" (Sensors for thread detectors) in Textiltechnik 34 (1984) 3 (page 131).<br>
A particular problem on ring spinning machines concerns the "crawling spindles", i.e. spindles, or their travellers respectively, rotating at a rotational speed below the predetermined "machine operating rotational speed". A thread breakage (or end down) results in a production stoppage at the spinning position concerned; this implies a reduction in efficiency of the machine as a whole - but does not entail further consequences. A crawling spindle, however, still produces a yarn the twist coefficient of which differs, possibly considerably, from the one of the thread produced on spindles that operate normally. A yarn of this type will cause waste in further processing stages. An operator furthermore is not in a position to immediately detect (visually) a crawling spindle at a spinning position, which actually is defective. Without the help of a measuring instrument and a corresponding display signal the<br><br>
operator is not in a position to evaluate the actual spindle rotational speed at a given spinning position.<br>
It thus already has been proposed that crawling spindles be detected with the help of a sensor arrangement - compare in this respect DE-A-4011944 and DE- A-4228300. In these documents, however, it is not clearly stated where the display is to be located. As indicated before the mere signal indicating the "presence" of a crawling spindle will not solve the operator's problems entirely. A display on a central control panel (e.g. according to DE-A-3940923 or DE-A-3701796) may be helpful but does not guide the operator directly to the spindle concerned. A system according to DE-A-3832482 indicates to the operator where a defect has occurred, it requires additional expenditure however, in particular an travelling service device and a removable marker. From the US-B-4635321 it is known that signal lamps can be provided in parts of the drafting system. This constitutes an improvement over the provision of a signal marker at the travelling service device (compare e.g. US-B-4030281) but still does not propose unmistakable guidance of the operator to a crawling spindle. Furthermore it is known that a so-called roving stop (e.g. according to the US-B-4432195) can be provided; This implies installation of a device of this type at each spinning position which entails an unacceptable expense in many cases.<br><br><br>
other sensors proposed are e.g. vibration sensors (US 4'254'613), optical sensors (EP-A-480 898) and acoustic sensors (EP-A-442 327).<br>
Further documents concern scanning systems for checking the status of the many individual sensors on a ring spinning machine. Examples are JP-B-8-16287; DE-A-37 44 208; CH-B-684 908; and DE-A-40 11 944.<br>
The great number of sensors also causes additional problems, e.g. concerning circuit wiring and signal transmission. Certain solutions were described e.g. in DE-A-30 05 746; EP-A-389 849; DE-A-36 37 969 and DE-A-196 31 302.<br>
Some very few documents finally concern the problem of the arrangement on the ring spinning machine, such as e.g. JP-A-9-279426 and CH-B-671 040.<br>
The Invention<br>
According to the present invention to every spinning position a corresponding device is coordinated signalling the state of a "crawling spindle". The co-ordination preferentially is chosen in such a manner that an operator located near this signal also is located in the vicinity of the spinning position concerned. The signal is to indicate unambiguously the spinning position affected. The signal preferentially is visually perceptible, e.g. a signal lamp. A signal device can be provided at each spinning position, but this is not necessarily required unless unambiguity is impaired by a "shared signal display". The signal device can be coordinated to the spinning position in such a manner that that it can be detected also from distant locations e.g. from the end of the machine. There is, however, in this case the risk of conflicting requirements the signal device must meet. According to the preferred solution the individual display means coordinated to the spinning positions are supplemented by large area display means which can guide the operator from a relatively far distant location to a location from which the display means of a spinning position concerned can be recognised easily. Thus e.g. at least at one and preferentially at either machine end a large area display means can be provided for each machine side. Furthermore on each side of the machine a plurality of sectional display means can be provided distributed over the length of the machine. Preferentially a sectional<br><br>
display means is provided for each stretch corresponding to a predetermined number of spinning positions.<br>
For detecting crawling spindles the present invention provides also an individual spindle sensor (i.e. a sensor coordinated to an individual spindle) for a ring spinning machine. The sensor preferentially is adapted emit a signal suitable for indicating a thread breakage (end down) as well as a "crawling state" of the spindle coordinated to the sensor. The sensor can cooperate with a processing and evaluating unit in which arrangement the display means at least signals the occurrence of a crawling state of a spindle. The display means preferentially is arranged in the vicinity of the spindle concerned. For the sensor and for the display means a common holder can be provided.<br>
The invention (the "previous invention") according to the EP Patent Application No. 00810364.00 filed April 28, 2000 provides a support member for a plurality of sensors to be mounted onto a ring spinning machine, characterized in that the support member comprises an elongated body with means for fastening the body to the ring rail laid out in such a manner that the body can extend over a longitudinal section of the machine corresponding to a plurality of spinning positions in which arrangement the body is laid out for taking up a corresponding number of sensors. The present invention now can be combined with the previous invention. The longitudinal section of the machine, however, preferentially does not correspond to the totality of all spinning positions on the corresponding machine side and thus a plurality of support members are to be fastened to the ring rail in such a manner that an individual sensor can be mounted coordinated to each spinning position of a machine side. The lengths of the bodies preferentially all are equal and after mounting they preferentially cover the front side of the ring rail end to end. In case a machine is laid out for the so-called sectional mounting (e.g. according to our patent application DE 197 55 780.5, filed December 16, 1997), the length of a body corresponds to the length of a machine section.<br>
The body preferentially is laid out as a profile and is e.g. substantially U-shaped in its cross-section. This body thus forms a duct for the wiring coordinated to the sensors.<br><br>
In the ring spinning machine neighbouring bodies can be arranged adjoining, or can be interconnected respectively, in such a manner that a continuous duct extending in the longitudinal direction is formed. The body preferentially is fastened to the front of the ring rail. In case the body is laid out as a U-shaped profile the "bottom" portion of the profile can be fastened to, the ring rail in such a manner that the two wall portions of the profile extend away from the ring rail. The body preferentially is laid out in such a manner that holders for the sensors, and for the corresponding display means can be attached to, and again detached from, the body, e.g. with the help of elastic interlocking shapes such as e.g. a snap-on connection or a socket-type connection.<br>

First the design of the ring rail of a ring spinning machine is dealt with where-after a design example of a support member according to the present invention is explained. Subsequently the sectional mounting of the ring spinning ma-chine and the corresponding preferred design lay-out of the support member and of the sensor system are discussed.<br>
The ring rail 110 according to the Fig. 2 comprises a horizontal support portion 113 (Fig. 1)fora ring 112 and towards the inside of the spinning machine a support part 111 whereon a rail 120 is fastened which supports a ring 124 for restraining the thread balloon. It is understood of course for each spindle 116 with its spinning tube 118 there is a respective opening 125 of the ring rail 110. a ring 112 ,a holder 122, and a further ring 124. A ring 112 is held in the ring rail by a holder ring 114. For guiding airflows openings 126 are pro-vided in the support part 111 and strips 128 are arranged extending from the support part 111 below the support portion 113. The openings 126 permit draining of the air flowing along the spinning packages according to the arrows 140a, 140b. Such openings, however, are not relevant in the context of the present invention. If air guide means of this type in the form of the openings 126 and the strips 128 are used the number of thread breakages (or ends down) as well as fly contamination of the machine can be reduced substantially, however.<br>
The ring rail 150 according to the Figures 3 and 4 to a large extent corresponds to the ring rail 110 according to the Figures 1 and 2, the holders 122 and the air<br><br>
openings 126 being omitted. This ring rail 150 is provided with a support member comprising a base body 152 formed as a U-shaped profile. The bottom portion 154 of the profile is adapted to the front side 156 of the ring rail 150, i.e. in this case the surface 158 of the profile bottom portion 154 facing the ring rail is flat and the "width" of this surface 158 substantially corresponds to the height of the ring rail front side 156. The front side 156 of the ring rail as well as the corresponding surface 158 of the profile bottom 154 also could e.g. be curved or formed with stepped edges, the two cross-sections being mutually adapted.<br>
The support body 152 is provided with a lip 160 which during the mounting process rests against the surface 162 oriented upward of the ring rail 150 and thus determines the height position of the profiled body. The bottom portion 154 of the body 152 is provided with a groove 164 for taking up fastening means (not shown). These fastening means also extend through a bore 166 in the front side 156 using which the support body 152 is fastened to the ring rail 150. Positioning of the body 152 in the longitudinal direction is discussed in more detail in the following.<br>
The side opposite the bottom portion 154 of the profiled body 152 is open as such, but after mounting is closed by a cover 168. The cover 168 can be connected to the profiled body 152 using a snap-on connection (schematically indicated with the reference number 170). The cover 168 also serves as a support for certain electronic elements as described in more detail in the following. These elements thus are readily accessible after the cover is taken off for maintenance work.<br>
The wall 172 of the profiled body 152 oriented upward is provided with openings 174 serving for taking up fastening means 176 which fasten sensor holders 178 to the body 152. The holders 178 preferentially can be taken off individually and the connection of each holder to the support element correspondingly should be easily detachable. A suitable connection can be established using a bayonet-type twist connection for which purpose the openings 174 can be laid out quadrangular (compare the Fig. 4). The details of the fastening means 176 are not shown in the Figures as various possibilities are readily available to the expert in the field.<br><br>
The profiled body 152 can be made from synthetic material or can be extruded using a metal alloy. The extruded ("endless") profile can be cut to predetermined lengths to form the individual bodies. The length of the various bodies will be discussed in the following in more detail. The cover can be formed from the same material, or from another material, using a similar manufacturing method. The preferred combination of materials comprises a profiled body made from aluminium alloy in combination with a cover made from synthetic material.<br>
In the spinning machine the openings 174 should be arranged in such a manner that the sensor (not shown) held in its holder 178 is positioned centred with respect to a ring 180 as can be seen from the Fig. 4; it is to be made clear that in the Fig. 4 for the sake of simplicity merely the inside rim 182 of the ring 180 and the outer rim of the ring holder 184 are shown specifically. The openings 174 must be cut out after extrusion of the body 152, neighbouring openings 174 being arranged at a predetermined distance from each other corresponding to the gauge of the spinning positions (ring axes) which is standardised in spinning machines. In mounting the profiled body 152 exact positioning of the whole body 152 in longitudinal direction of the ring rail must be ensured without special attention being paid to the individual holders 178. Positioning can be facilitated by rationally designing the fastening means between the profiled body 152 and the ring rail 150. The fastening means (not shown) can comprise e.g. clamping screws holding the body 152 against the ring rail 150 without precluding a shifting movement in the longitudinal direction in the groove 164 (i.e. in the longitudinal direction of the ring rail 150) before the screws are tightened completely. Only after the body 152 has reached its correct position in the longitudinal direction the clamping screws are tightened completely.<br>
The elements 186 shown in the Fig. 4 schematically represent fastening elements used for fastening the ring holders to the ring rail 150 whereas the element 188 represents a so-called traveller cleaner such as shown e.g. in DE-A-197 53 767. The traveller itself is indicated in the Fig. 4 with the reference number 190, The ring 180 shown in the Fig. 3 is laid out as a so-called "inclined flange ring" (e.g. according to<br><br>
EP-B-528 056). The present invention, however, can be applied, however, also with other ring types.<br>
The holder 178 is designed for taking up a magnetic sensor which reacts to the revolutions of the traveller 190 on the ring 180 during the spinning process. The design and the function of such sensors being well known to the expert in the field further details of the sensor are not discussed further here. The present invention as such is not limited to any specific type of sensor even if it obviously proves advantageous if a contact-free sensor type is chosen. For this embodiment it is important merely that the sensor moves together with the ring rail which is ensured as the sensor is fastened to the ring rail.<br>
Under certain circumstances it can be important that the position of a holder 178 (and of the sensor held therein, respectively) can be adapted in radial direction with respect to the ring 180, e.g. if a ring 180 of a given diameter is replaced by a ring of another diameter, as the distance of the sensor from the traveller in many cases (in particular if magnetic sensors are applied) is decisive for its function. A corresponding solution is shown schematically in the Fig. 3A (to an enlarged scale). The inner side of the wall 172 is provided with a plurality of grooves 200 (three in the case shown here) extending in the longitudinal direction. These grooves can be formed in the extrusion process at precisely predetermined positions relative to the contacting surface 158. A clamping element 202 of the fastening means for the holder 178 is provided with ribs 204 which can engage one or another of the grooves 202 in such a manner that a snap-on connection is obtained. The distance of the sensor (not shown) from the central axis of the ring 180 thus depends on which of the grooves 200 is engaged. In a position chosen (as shown in the Fig. 3A) the fastening arrangement of the holder can be in contact with one end of the opening 174, in another position chosen with the other end of the opening 174 and in a third position chosen the fastening arrangement can be placed freely between the ends of the opening. The clamping element 202 should provide the elasticity required for ensuring a rigid connection between the holder 174 and the body 152 without impairing the detachability of this connection.<br><br>
With reference to the Fig. 5 now the so-called sectional mounting procedure is to be explained for which purpose the data from our patent application DE 197 55 780.5, filed December 16, 1997, are repeated here.<br>
As a rule long spinning machines are subdivided in sections in such a manner that the mounting procedure can be effected at least partially in the manufacturing works and that on the other hand pre-assembled units can be joined without excessive effort during the final mounting procedure in the spinning mill. A concept of this nature is known e.g. from the German Patent Application DE 882 967. The spinning machine substantially is subdivided into longitudinal elements lined up coaxially, the longitudinal elements being interconnected mutually using transverse members (samsons or frames). A machine section is to be substantially "self-supporting" i.e. it is to be mountable without the help of neighbouring machine sections. The general principle is shown in the Fig. 5. Accordingly a section of a ring spinning machine between two samsons 12 (of which only one samson 12 is visible in the Fig. 5) comprises in its lower part a doffer support 34 with a doffer bearing 32 a guard rail 30 being arranged at the outer side of the doffer support. At the lower part of the samson a wiring duct 30a as well as a spindle rail part 26 are provided laterally mounted onto the samson 12.<br>
In the completely mounted state a plurality of spindles 40 (the number of which is to be discussed later in detail) are placed lined up on the spindle rail 26. Furthermore holders 22 for guide rods 20 are fastened laterally on the samson 12 which are movable vertically and guide a part of the ring rail 24 and a part of a thread guide rail 28. The longitudinal elements ring rail 24, thread guide rail 28 are connected via transverse cross members 20b, 20a with the guide rod 20.<br>
Of the two-sided machine the machine side left of the central plane M only is shown in the Fig. 5 schematically. In the upper part of the cross member or samson 12 a cylinder support rail 14 is arranged which is designed as a longitudinal element also, supporting a further longitudinal element, namely the suction duct 32. Furthermore cylinder support members 16 are supported on the cylinder rail 14 supporting the drafting arrangement 18, In the drafting arrangement the drafting cylinders are<br><br>
contained as further longitudinal elements 18a using which drafting of the material of the yarn indicated with dashed lines is effected. On the upper part of the cylinder support member 16 a support member 40a is arranged for parts of the creel in which the material to be spun into yarn is stored.<br>
A long spinning machine can comprise one thousand spinning positions and more, each with one spindle 40 and a ring-traveller combination 24a, 24b as well as a drafting system position. The parts described together form a more or less complete (two-sided) section of a long spinning machine 10 of the type mentioned in which this section comprises a pre-determined number ("standardised" by the manufacturer) of spindles or spinning positions. A suitable number of spindles per section is e.g. forty-eight, i.e. twenty-four on each side of a two-sided section. The present invention is not limited, however, to this number of spindles which can differ from one manufacturer to the other.<br>
In a completely mounted spinning machine thus a large number (e.g. fifty or even more) of machine sections 11 are lined up in a row between a so-called head stock and a foot end unit (for the overall arrangement see e.g. the Fig. 1 in DE-A-39 35 901). The actual number of sections in a given machine depends on the requirements of the spinning mill where the machine is to be used, the maximum number of sections being limited due to problems stemming from the transmission of the drive forces, and of the suction air respectively, etc. from the head stock and the foot end unit. The concept of the sup-port structure of a section thus provides at least two cross members 12 inter-connected with longitudinal elements 30, 30', 26, etc., i.e. samsons in which additional members thereof or of another machine section 11 such as the ring rail 24' with separators 25 and/or rails 42 are stored temporarily for shipment in the machine section described. In the spinning mill the partially assembled sections are completed with the individual elements in such a manner that a ma-chine of the length ordered (number of spindles and derived therefrom, the number of machine sections) is obtained.<br>
From the above explanations two findings are apparent without further descriptions, namely that:<br><br>
-	on one hand a ring rail 150 (Fig. 3) according to the concept of the sectional<br>
mounting is built up from a plurality of longitudinal part elements where the length<br>
of the part element substantially equals the length of a machine section, and that<br>
-	on the other hand the length of the profiled body 152 (Fig. 3) preferentially is<br>
adapted to the length of the machine section in such a manner that each profiled<br>
body 152 can be coordinated to a corresponding ring rail part element.<br>
From this it is clear that the number of holders 178 per profiled body 152 is to be equal to the number of rings 180 contained in the corresponding ring rail part element where this number depends on the mounting concept applied by the machine manufacturer. It also will be clear that the present invention is not restricted to the equality of the lengths of the profiled bodies and of the machine section lengths of a given machine. It also would be possible to apply two or more different profiled bodies on each side of the machine. It also would be feasible to supply each profiled body in a standardised length which is not adapted to any particular machine section concept in which case every profiled body is to be cut to suitable length for adapting it to the given situation.<br>
With reference to the Fig. 6 the general concept of the sensor system of the machine is described in more detail in the following before the above mentioned electronic elements arranged in each section are dealt with. It is assumed that each machine section is equipped with its own micro computer which processes the output signals of the sensors coordinated to this machine section. Each of the section computers communicates with a central unit in which arrangement the connections with this central unit may differ depending on the general concept applied.<br>
In the Fig. 6 thus fifty machine section units SI through S50 are indicated schematically which are connected to an adapter via a bus circuit, and further details of an individual unit S25 are shown as an example for all the other units all units SI through S50 being equal. The unit 325 comprises a computer chip (printed circuit board) PCB as well as individual circuits LI through L24 between the input/output ports on this chip and the individual connecting elements VI through V24. These<br><br>
connecting elements V1 through V24 are de-signed, and fastened relative to the openings 174 (Fig. 3), in such a manner that as a holder 178 is placed into its take-up opening 174 the signal input and output ports of the sensor supported bj/his ).-^||AA^ holder are automatically (without further manipulation) connected to the chipPCB via the corresponding circuit Lx. The chip PCB also is provided with main signal input and output means for connection to the bus circuit. The bus circuit can be laid out as a so-called Ethernet bus circuit, the present invention not being restricted to a particular type bus circuit. Finally each computer PCB is connected with a signal lamp SL coordinated to it. The purpose of this signal lamp is to be explained in more detail in the following.<br>
The adapter A itself is not necessarily to be equipped with a computer. It serves for connecting the bus circuit with other control units, in particular with the machine control unit, or with the energy supply M of the machine and with a central unit ZE which processes the data supplied by the sensors. The central unit ZE in turn can be connected to a data storage and process control system SW, e.g. with a system supplied by the applicant company under the name "Spiderweb". This connection, however, is not dealt with in more detail here as is not concerned directly within the context of the present invention. All connections preferentially are laid out for bilateral communication, however.<br>
The arrangement shown in the Fig. 6 is based on two "prevailing conditions", namely that:<br>
-	the sensor system to be applied to the spinning machine can not be tied into the wiring of the machine, or that the central unit ZE can not be integrated directly into the machine control system, and that<br>
-	the sensor system is not to be connected with a sliver stop function (e.g. according to DE-A-35 26 305). The present invention, however, is not restricted to applications within these prevailing conditions, i.e. it can be realised alternatively in the framework of a system according to EP-B-389 849.<br><br>
It thus is not necessary that a central unit be provided for each machine, i.e. the adapters A of a plurality of spinning machines can be connected to a common central unit ZE. For the sake of simplicity it is assumed in the further description that every machine be equipped with its own central unit ZE (Fig. 6) and that this central unit is coping with tasks pertinent to the ends down sensor system merely (no machine control functions). The central unit in any case has no direct connection to the individual sensors supported in their holders 178 but only via the bus circuit to the sectional computer PCB. Each of the sectional computers thus is laid out for scanning the sensors coordinated to it for their actual status (multiplexor function) and for transmitting the corresponding information to the central unit upon request by the latter. The type of the information to be transmitted is described in more detail in the following after the explanation of the arrangement of the electronic elements in each section with reference to the Figures 3 and 4.<br>
The chip PCB in each machine section is arranged in the cover 168 of the pro-filed body 152 coordinated to this machine section. The circuit Lx (compare Fig. 6; not shown in the Fig. 3) for a sensor extends from the chip PCB in the direction of the opening 174 using which the sensor holder 178 is to be fastened to the body 152. This circuit can be provided with a fast connecting means (not shown) in such a manner that it can be easily connected to a circuit connected to the sensor for the signal transmission. The main input and output ports (HS, Fig. 6) can be connected with the input and output ports of the neighbouring chips while the support members are mounted. The profiled bodies 152 with their covers 168 thus form a cable or wiring duct protecting the electronic elements and their connecting circuits.<br>
In principle it is possible, with the help of the sensors known today and reacting to the traveller movement, to obtain two information indications concerning a spinning position, namely:<br>
a)	thread is being wound on, or is not being wound, and<br>
b)	the spindle rotational speed.<br><br>
In the case a) the chip PCB based on the sensor output signal determines whether the traveller periodically travels past the sensor (thread being wound) or not (no thread being wound). In the case b) the Chip PCB additionally must determine the number of traveller passages over a given time period. The chip preferentially also is capable of detecting defective sensors.<br>
The chip PCB thus locally stores and processes the output signals transmitted by the sensors coordinated to it. if no defects are detected, no "incident telegrams" are to be transmitted to the central unit ZE. The following disorders, however, must be reported using such telegrams:<br>
1)	a thread breakage (end down) is detected,<br>
2)	spindle speed outside the given tolerances,<br>
3)	defective sensor.<br>
At the same time the signal lamp SL (Fig. 6) coordinated to this machine section is to be lit in order to signal to the operator in which section the defect has occurred. It would be advantageous to provide the defect signals with a spindle identification (e.g. number) and possibly with a "time tag". But also on the basis of signals per machine section (without time tag) the central unit, or the data handling unit SW is able to evaluate the operational behaviour of the spinning machine and to display it in such a manner that the operating personnel can take action. If no time tag can be reported with the information an incident preferentially is signalled "immediately" using a "telegram" to the central unit where the time moment of the report transmission can be scanned and stored.<br>
It can be of particular interest if information can be obtained covering particular time periods, e.g. the number of thread breakages during the start-up of the machine after a doffing process ("start-up thread breakages). In order to render this feasible and also in order to avoid misinterpretations during standstill periods, during start-up and during completion of a spinning cycle the chips PCB must be informed by the central unit ZE as to the actual operating mode of the machine, or must be given orders, respectively, which start and/or sup-press certain processing steps in the chips.<br><br>
The various functions thus can be summarised as follows: The machine section:<br>
-	receives from the central unit during initialisation the parameters:<br>
-	minimum rotational speed (tread running)<br>
-	the time interval to be applied in detecting so-called "crawling spindles".<br><br>
-	determines, based on the signals for the correctly running spindles, an aver-age rotational speed within the machine section<br>
-	determines a status summary for the spindles coordinated to it concerning<br><br>
-	thread breakage(s) occurred<br>
-	crawling spindle(s) present<br>
-	sensor(s) defective<br><br>
-	periodically receives from the central unit ZE a rotational speed value for detecting the crawling spindles. Spindles (or travellers, respectively) running at a speed lower than the predetermined rotational speed over a time period exceeding the predetermined crawler time interval are detected as crawling spindles.<br>
-	cyclically determines during operation the spinning position status and if required switches on the signal lamp SL when an incident telegram is transmitted to the central unit ZE.<br>
-	determines during the start-up phase and/or the doffing phase the number of thread breakages. Information regarding thread breakages occurring during these phases must be stored in the machine section and are to be transmitted in a special message upon request signalled by the central unit (after completion of the special phase). During such phases normally the spindle rotational speed is not scanned as it is changing continually. The start, and the end respectively, of such phases is signalled by the central unit.<br>
The adapter:<br>
-	transmits the signals from the machine sections<br>
-	transmits a signal indicating whether the machine is running or not<br><br>
-	transmits a doff phase signal.<br>
The central unit (so for as it has not been described above):<br>
-	summarises data per spindle (e.g. per shift)<br>
-	periodically determines, based on the section rotational speeds, the limit rotational speed for determining the crawler spindles and transmits this limit rotational speed value to the machine sections.<br>
In the Fig. 7 now an example of a further development according to the present invention is shown. The holder 178 is provided with an attachment 300 which takes up the sensor device 302. The sensor device 302 comprises e.g. means for generating a magnetic field and a Hall effect sensor (not shown in detail) reacting to the "disturbances" in the magnetic field generated by the traveller rotating on the ring. The holder 178 also supports a light source (e.g. a light emitting diode 306) which also is connected to the PCB via a circuit 308. The function of this light source is to be explained in the following.<br>
In the embodiment according to the Figures 1 through 6 the cover 168 also serves for supporting certain electronic components (in particular a computer board PCB). This is feasible in principle but it does not represent the preferred solution. In the embodiment according to the Fig. 7 the electronic components PCB preferentially are arranged independently of the cover 168 and behind it in the duct in which arrangement they can be easily mounted and removed with the help of suitable releasable fastening means. These components thus are easily accessible for maintenance work if the cover is removed. The PCB is connected to a central evaluation and processing unit as described earlier further discussion thus being dispensed with.<br>
If the spindle rotational speed exceeds the tolerances, the PCB can switch on the energy supply of the light source 306 in such a manner that at the spinning position concerned this defect is signalled right away. The defect also is re-ported to the central unit in such a manner that it also is signalled there to be displayed. The operator thus is alerted as fast as possible and is in a position to prevent defective spinning packages from being carried forward. Fast action in this case is of great<br><br>
importance as resulting costs incurred in the further processing stages are considerable. At the same time a signal lamp coordinated to the machine section concerned can be lit in order to inform the operating personnel in which section of the long spinning machine the defect has occurred.<br>
It would be advantageous to transmit the defect reports to the central unit with a spindle identification and possibly an added "time tag". But also on the basis of reports per machine section (without time tag) the central unit is capable to evaluate and to display the operational behaviour of the machine in such a manner that the operating personnel can take action. If no time tag is transmitted the incident preferentially is reported "immediately" using a "telegram" to the central unit where the time moment of the report transmission can be re-corded.<br>
The light source 306 of course not necessarily is to be provided in the holder 178 but also could be arranged separately on the machine, preferentially in the vicinity of the spindle affected. An alternative solution could be seen in that a signal would be generated only at the central unit or at a machine section unit. The combination with the sensor, however, is given preference the connection to the PCB being direct.<br>
In the Fig. 8 a lay-out is shown schematically of three ring spinning machines 310, 312 and 314 respectively, arranged side by side in which arrangement the machine longitudinal axes Ax are mutually parallel. Each of the machines shows a longitudinal side LA and a longitudinal side LB representing a mirror image of the latter. Each of the machines comprises an end head stock K and at the other end a foot end unit F. The head stocks K are arranged next to a main aisle (aisle 1) and the foot units F also are arranged next to a main aisle (aisle 2). The main aisles are interconnected via operating aisles BG1 and BG2 extending between the machines. The centre sections of the machines, seen in longitudinal direction, have been omitted in the Fig. 8 the end units concerned being sufficient for describing the operator guiding concept. Ac-cording to the lay-out concept described with reference to the Fig. 6 each longitudinal side LA, and LB respectively, comprises sections of spinning positions SI, S2, S3,..., etc., where in the Figure 8 just the sections 81, S2, S24 and S25 are shown specifically on the longitudinal side LB of the machine 314. Each<br><br>
section comprises holders according to the Fig. 7 with a signal lamp 306 each. These lamps being rather small but the machine sides being very long it can be assumed the effect of one lamp 306 alone will not be sufficient to at-tract the attention of an operator located in a main aisle and to "call" him to the spinning position affected. In order to improve the operator guiding system in this respect each head stock K and each foot unit F is equipped with a signal lamp LLA coordinated to the longitudinal side LA and with a signal lamp LLB coordinated to the longitudinal side LB.<br>
If now a defect occurs on a spinning position on a given machine side (e.g. the side LB of the machine 314) one, or both signal lamps of this machine side light up; in the example shown only one single lamp LLB at the foot unit F of the machine 314 lights up this lamp in the Fig. 8 being shown blackened. An operator located in the main aisle 1 or 2 thus is guided to the foot unit F of the machine 314. If the lamp LLB on the foot unit F is not clearly visible from the main aisle 1 the lamp LLB on the headstock K of the machine 314 also can be lit. Assumed the defective spinning position is located near the foot unit and the lamp LLB only of this unit is lit, it is possible that the operator now can spot from this unit the lighted signal lamp 306 and directly can proceed to the spinning position concerned. If, however, both lamps LLB of the machine 314 are lit (i.e. the "relevant" machine end not being indicated) or if the defective spinning position is located at the center of the machine it is much less likely that the operator directly can proceed to the spindle concerned. Under these circumstances it proves advantageous if additional signal lamps are arranged along the machine sides indicating the longitudinal section in which the defective spinning position is located. It thus seems advantageous that one signal lamp of such type be provided per section as shown in the Fig. 6 as well as in the Fig. 8 where the signal lamp SL of the section 24 in the Fig. 8 lights up (shown darkened) whereas the other signal lamps are not lit (shown blank). The operator thus will be alerted by the "large area signal display" LLA, LLB as well as by the sector signal displays SL of the machine 314 that the defective spindle is located within the section 24 of the longitudinal side LB of the machine 314. Once the operator arrives at this section 24 he spots the lit lamp 306 in the section 24 without difficulties.<br><br>
A driver concept for this operator guiding system is shown schematically in the Fig. 9 where a section computer PCB24 (compare the Fig. 6) and the end units of both neighbouring computers PCB23, and PCB25 respectively, are shown schematically each with the signal lamp SL coordinated to it. For the computer PCB24 also sensors 302 and signal lamps 306 are indicated schematically in which arrangement each sensor 302 is paired with the corresponding signal lamp 306 via the computer PCB24 as indicated with dashed lines. Evaluation of the signals given off by the sensors 302 is effected by the corresponding computer PCB and lighting of the signal lamp 306 of a defective spinning position and of the signal lamp of the corresponding section is effected directly by the computer PCB. It does not make sense, however, to connect each computer PCB directly to the lamps LLA and LLB (compare the Fig. 8) as this would entail very high wiring cost. Lighting of the machine side signal lamps thus is effected via the central machine control unit ZE (compare the Fig. 6).<br>
In the Fig. 10 it is shown that it is not necessary to provide a signal lamp at each spinning position. A common lamp for each pair of spinning positions could be provided instead, the light being emitted via one or the other opening of a pair of openings in which arrangement the one (e.g. arrow-shaped) opening 316 is pointed towards the spinning position 320 and the other opening 318 is pointed towards the other spinning position 322. It also would be feasible to provide just one single lamp per section the light of which is transmitted via a suitable light guide to a suitable display device in the vicinity of the spinning position concerned if a defect is detected.<br>
In the Fig. 11 a further development of the embodiment according to the Fig. 3 is shown the same reference numbers being used as far as possible for elements shown identically, in particular for the ring rail 150 (including its front side 156), the ring 180, the traveller 190 and the ring holder 184. The profiled body 152 according<br>
V       to the Fig. 3 in the Fig. 11 is replaced by a base membej" 330JThe base member 330<br>
Q.			^—-—-"■ r-.i,:g__-^^^-.x,..,		.„^M^-—^—~^.-	-'—-' ^^,Z&gt;^<br>
vV/comprises a bottom parf332)which is fastened to the ring rail front side 156 by \      suitable means (not shown). The base member is provided with two walls 334, 336 extending towards the front in which arrangement each of the walls is provided with an inside bulge 338 located at the end distant from the ring rail. The walls 334, 336 in<br><br>
principle can form a unit with the spindle rail 150. The bulges 338 each form a detachable connection of interlocking profiles with connecting elements 340, 342 of a holder 344 taking up the traveller sensor 346 and/or the spindle state display device 348. The walls 334, 336 can be relatively rigid compared to the elements 340, 342 or the walls 334, 336 as well as the elements 340, 342 can be elastically deformable in order to fomi a releasable snap-on connection. The holder 344 can be made from synthetic plastic material preferentially in one piece. In addition to the connecting elements 340, 342 it comprises a hollow protrusion 350 which in the Fig. 11 is shown partly cut away in order to show the sensor 346 held therein as well as a setting 352 for the display means 348 which can be pro-vided in the form of a signal lamp.<br>
The connecting elements 340, 342 also serve as fastening elements for a signal processing unit SA connected to the display means 348 and to the sensor 346 via circuits 354, 356. It will be clear that the holder 344 also forms a part cover for the duct within the base member 330 the position of the holder 344 in the longitudinal direction of the machine not being (pre-)determined but being adjustable as the holder can be shifted in the longitudinal direction of the base member 330. This variant thus requires exact mounting of the holder 344 on the ring frame in order to ensure that the sensors 346 each face a ring 180, and a traveller 190 respectively. If the scanning range of each sensor is correctly chosen the output signal given off by the corresponding sensor is not susceptible against minor displacements in the machine longitudinal direction. The holder 344 and the elements it supports now form a module for generating, processing and evaluating, and displaying signals which can transmit signals to the sectional computer (not shown in the Fig. 11).<br>
The holder 344 according to the Fig. 11 is provided for one single sensor 346. In the Fig. 12 a module 356 comprising two protrusions 350. The two protrusions 350 each take up a sensor in such a manner that after assembly on the machine the sensors are coordinated to a spindle (not shown) each. This variant also comprises two settings 352 for a signal lamp 348 each in which arrangement the signal lamps 348 also are coordinated to a spindle each. The module 356 can be provided with a common signal evaluation unit (not shown) for the two sensors. In a variant of this<br><br>
type the connecting elements 340. 342 (not visible in the Fig. 12, compare the Fig. 11) not necessarily extend over the whole length of the module 356 (seen in the machine longitudinal direction). The element 340 as well as the element 342 can consist of a plurality of elastic "prongs" in which arrangement at least two prongs should be provided on the upper side (element 340) as well as two prongs at the lower side (element 342). The distance Ab between the axes of the protrusions 350 can correspond to the spindle gauge or can be adapted approximately merely to the spindle gauge. It is known e.g. that ring spinning machines of the same general type are supplied either with a spindle gauge of 75 mm or with a spindle gauge of 70 mm. If the sensor type is chosen appropriately (providing a large scanning field) a common module 356 with a distance Ab of 72.5 mm can take care of both machine variant types. In such cases insertion of spacer elements between neighbouring modules might be necessary in order to completely cover the duct in the base member 344 on machines presenting a spindle gauge of 75 mm.<br>
In the Fig. 13 finally a module 360 is shown (at a different scale) with four protrusions 350. This four point module can be applied in combination with the double (two-point) module according to the Fig. 12 e.g. in such a manner that for a "section" of 24 spindles per machine side on both machine sides ten double modules 356 and one four point module 360 are used. The four point module not only comprises the signal processing and evaluating unit (not shown) for its own sensors but also the sectional computer (not shown) and the section display (signal lamp) SL. As the details of the four point module 360 correspond to the description of the double module 356 a more detailed discussion and illustration of the four point module is dispensed with here.<br><br><br><br><br>
