HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br><br>
7-9-2007<br>
ORIGINAL<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a nozzle and in particular to a nozzle for filling flowable viscous material such as creams/pastes in tubes for providing striped dispensing of the same. Importantly, the nozzle of the invention would enable simple and cost effective uniform filling of striping paste in tubes at a faster rate and ensure dispensing of uniformly striped paste for use. The invention particularly but not exclusively relates to striping paste in toothpaste tubes and the like required for providing striped dispensing of toothpaste.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Viscous flowable materials such as creams and pastes are known to be provided in flexible containers such as deformable tubes and the like. Usually, viscous flowable materials such as toothpaste and the like are filled in such tubes through the rear open end of the tube which after the filling is completed is sealed and crimped. Thereafter, in use the toothpaste is released by applying a deforming pressure on the tube whereby the paste is dispensed through an outlet at the front.<br>
Over the years, to provide variety to the end user / consumer toothpaste manufacturers have come up with novel forms of toothpaste which apart from serving the functional purposes of the paste could also impart aesthetic appeal to the user/consumer. A particularly known variety of such toothpaste involve multi colored toothpaste commonly known as striped toothpaste. In order to achieve such dispensing of multicolored striped toothpaste manufacturers have to provide varieties of toothpaste tubes to accommodate multicolored forms of the paste.<br>
In our co-pending application 323/BOM/1995 dated 19th July 1995 there is disclosed a dual tube dispenser assembly for separate storage of two similar materials and simultaneous dispensing of the said materials as and when required. Such a dual tube dispenser comprised a small sized tube containing one said material and having a deformable body portion; an adapter secure to the mouth and/or neck portion of said small sized tube and having at least one passage communicating with the inside of said small tube; said adapter further<br><br>
having means to co-axially retain such small sized tube secured thereto internally and with respect to a large sized tube the later also having a deformable body portion; the intermediate space there between the external surface of the small sized tube with adapter and the internal surface of the large size tube containing the other of said dissimilar materials such that upon application of force / pressure on the deformable body portion of the large sized tube said dissimilar materials from said small size tube and said intermediate space dispense simultaneously from the mouth portion of said large size tube to dispense a multiÂ¬coloured paste.<br>
In our other copending application 379/BOM/96 dated 19th July 1996 there is disclosed a nozzle assembly adapted for use with conventional toothpaste tube filling machines which could be used to fill in the aforesaid dual tube dispensers. The nozzle assembly basically comprised of an adapter for detachably connecting to the outlet port of a conventional filling machine; an intermediate chamber; and a multiple filling nozzle head.<br>
in order to add variety to the provision of stripe toothpaste it is also known to have containers/tubes with segmented portions providing for different colored toothpaste materials contained therein. Along with the need for such striped toothpaste various apparatuses for filling such toothpaste have also been developed from time to time. Generally, such apparatus include a nozzle through which the toothpaste is introduced into the container, and usually comprise a tubular mostly cylindrical body within which there is a central longitudinal channel usually having a cylindrical bore and a plurality of side channels surrounding the central channel.<br>
US5590818 discloses a novel, multi-segmented nozzle for dispensing viscous material, particularly for dispensing differently colored toothpaste into toothpaste tubes so as to produce toothpaste of striped appearance when dispensed from the tube. The nozzle has a tubular body defined by an outer body wall, and has within the tubular body a central channel and a plurality of longitudinal first and second side channels situated around the central channel.    The first side<br><br>
channels have a cross section which narrows towards the central channel; the second side channels have a rectangular cross section. Because of this configuration the nozzle is able to load multicolored toothpaste tubes which dispense toothpaste in a substantially more uniform striped pattern than conventionally loaded multicolored toothpaste tubes.<br>
US 6418986 discloses yet another a nozzle for use with an apparatus for inserting toothpaste having a plurality of materials into a toothpaste container. The nozzle includes a first hollow member for receiving a first material, and a second hollow member arranged inside the first hollow member for receiving a second material. The first and second hollow members enable the first and second materials to be inserted into the toothpaste container such that one of the first and second materials is arranged inside the other of the first and second materials when the toothpaste is dispensed from the toothpaste container.<br>
The above known striped toothpaste containers essentially involve either the provision of multiple tubular members and/or segmented internal regions to contain multicolored toothpaste forms in the segmented / separated compartments and/or very complex nozzle configurations such that on use the multicolored striped paste could be generated. These refer to co-extrusion of two different coloured materials in tubes that are not provided with inserts. However, the provision of such multi tubular or segmented / compartmented internal region and/or the complex nozzle construction for such striped toothpaste are necessarily expensive to obtain which make such products cost extensive for the ultimate consumer and may not thus be affordable to one and all.<br>
It is also known to have cost-effective variants of striped toothpaste wherein the toothpaste container is adapted to obtain the striped dispensing of paste by provision of a striping insert internally supported with respect to the mouth/top opening of the toothpaste tube that longitudinally extends internally upto a length along the axis of the tube. The insert is basically a smaller dimensional tubular member having fine openings which help establishing communication with the contents of the tube in the annular region external of said insert and the insert<br><br>
inside communicating with the toothpaste tube opening at the front. In such construction of toothpaste tubes even without any internal compartment the paste of a particular color could be fed in and stored in the annular region upto just under the height of the insert while over that the toothpaste of another color and variety is packaged. Thus, upon completed filling of such toothpaste when the toothpaste tube is pressed for use, the variety of the toothpaste accommodating substantially the rear of the toothpaste tube which is centrally in operative communication through the central passage of the insert is exited out while the other colored variety of the toothpaste which is stored in the annular region surrounding the insert at the front end of the toothpaste tube upon experiencing the pressure is forced through the pores in the insert to create stripes on the main paste material exiting through the outlet. Thus, even without provision of either dual tubes of compartments / segmented regions in a tubular container by simple use of such insert it is possible to achieve dispensing of striped paste to suit the consumer aesthetic needs at cost-effective rates.<br>
Such striped toothpaste tubes with insert for producing / generating striped toothpaste however require special nozzle to fill in the toothpaste varieties especially in the annular region surrounding the insert near the front opening. As mentioned above, this variety of the toothpaste need to be packaged upto about just under the height of the insert and it is always required to be maintained below the insert top to avoid contamination of the two varieties of the paste in the container. The criticality involved in such feeding is that while a substantial length of the insert need to be filled up with the paste, it should in no case exceed the height of the insert inside the tube. It is therefore known to use a specific variety of nozzle means which at one end i.e. the rear end is adapted to operatively connect to a source for such toothpaste while at its other end i.e. the front end a plurality of circularly disposed nozzle heads are provided such that the insert could pass through the middle of the circularly disposed nozzle heads to finally rest against the platform supporting the nozzle heads to thereby block the insert central opening while the nozzle heads which extend downwards are used to provide the paste material in the annular region inside of the tube around the insert.<br><br>
It is experienced that in carrying out the filling involving such nozzle means, the striping paste is forced to dispense as discrete ribbons through circular orifices at the end of each of long stemmed multiple nozzle heads. Such feeding of the paste in discrete ribbons lead to typical noodle type stack up of the paste in the annular region surrounding the insert. Such noodle type stack-up of the paste necessarily lead to loss of valuable filling space since noodle like stack up can never attain uniform and compete filling in the annular zone around the insert during the filling operation. However, even if we hold it for a time period there will not be a uniformity which will lead to non- uniform stripping quality.<br>
Added to the above, it is also observed that the provision of longer stems and very fine outlet for the nozzle heads required to avoid overflow of the paste material beyond the insert height also lead to filling of the paste through the various nozzle heads at different heights. This again therefore resulted in nonÂ¬uniform filling of the paste throughout the annular region surrounding the insert.<br>
Moreover, it is also experienced that the fine opening of the nozzle heads sometimes get clogged leading to further problems of filling which also contribute towards non-uniform filing of the paste along the annular region surrounding the insert. All these problems of filling the annular zone surrounding the insert in striped toothpaste tubes lead to slow machine speed and overall fall in productivity along with occasional problems of color contamination and stripping quality variation. Also, the long stemmed, narrow opening nozzle heads are found to be extremely difficult to clean and maintain which again seriously affect the required cleanliness and hygiene required for filling of such sensitive material such as toothpaste and the like which are supposed to come in oral contact.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for improvement in the system of filling of striped viscous flowable materials such as creams/pastes, in particular striped toothpaste following the insert route which would lead to<br><br>
faster and cost effective filling and at the same time ensure uniform discharge of striped paste from such toothpaste container and the like.<br>
Another object is to provide fast and uniform filling of stripped viscous flowable materials such as creams/pastes, in particular striped toothpaste using insert technology which would avoid the problems of prior art of filling of striping paste following the insert route.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a nozzle adapted for filling flowable viscous material such as filling of striped toothpaste in containers / toothpaste tubes following the insert route.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a nozzle for fast and uniform filling of stripped viscous flowable materials such as creams/pastes, in particular striped toothpaste in the annular zone surrounding the insert in striping toothpaste container and the like directed to favour achieving uniform striping, avoid color contamination on,tip during initial squeeze and permit higher tolerance to cohesion value (CV)/meological variations of paste during initial squeeze.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide for uniform and complete filling of stripped viscous flowable materials such as creams/pastes, in striped toothpaste and the like for dispensing striped paste and would enable clear ribbon cut off at nozzle tip without requiring additional aids such as air jets etc.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a nozzle which would enable not only simple and fast filling of paste for generating striped paste through insert route but would also be simple and easy to maintain ensuring the desired cleanliness and hygienic requirements of such nozzles.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a nozzle which would apart from improving the filling speed would also ensure that optimum filling and<br><br>
storing of the striping paste around the insert free -of contamination thereby avoiding loss and/or improper dispensing of the striped paste.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a nozzle for filling of striped flowable viscous materials such as cream/paste in tubes following insert route and the like comprising:<br>
i. a cylindrical body member having a front end adapted to operatively interact with the insert and a rear end adapted to be operatively connected to a source of the filling material;<br>
ii. a valve means disposed between said front and rear ends of said cylindrical body member and adapted to sit on and close the insert central opening when filling said paste in the annular zone surrounding the insert;<br>
iii. at least one opening in the front end adapted to at least partly surround the insert for feeding in the striping paste around the striping insert as a bulk jet in operative communication yvith the rear end operatively connected to the source of said filling material. <br>
For the purpose of the invention, flowable viscous materials such as cream/paste refer to materials which exhibit newtonian behaviour and have high viscosity, typically 104 to 106 Pa.sec at 10-1 sce-1 shear rate. The paste has a critical viscosity (CV) of 150-400 g.<br>
The said cyclindrical body and the valve means are either permanantly or removably fixed to each other. The valve means disposed internally and centrally close to said front end may be held by one or more connectors such that the valve means is held to the cylindrical body. The annular opening thus defined which surroundâ said valve and the internal surface of the cylindrical member is maintained in communication with said rear end providing for filling of the paste materia} in bulk jet in the annular region surrounding the insert.<br><br>
In accordance with a preferred aspect the nozzle of theinvention comprises:<br>
i) a cylindrical body member having a front end adapted to operatively interact with the insert and a rear end adapted to be operatively connected to a source of the filling material;<br>
ii) a valve means disposed between said front and rear ends of said cylindrical body member and adapted to sit on and close the insert central opening when filling said paste in the annular zone surrounding the insert; said valve means disposed internally and centrally close to said front end and held by at least one connector to the cylindrical body to define an annular opening surrounding said valve and the internal surface of the cylindrical member maintained in communication with said rear end providing for filling of the paste material in bulk jet in the annular region surrounding the insert.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred aspect of the invention the valve is disposed between said front and rear ends and provided centrally within said cylindrical member and supported by three spaced apart connectors with respect to said cylindrical body to thereby define three annular openings in operative communication with the rear opening for feeding the paste as bulk jet in the annular zone surrounding the insert, the feeding of paste through broader nozzle openings surrounding the insert can avoid on one hand the problem of clogging / blocking of the openings of multiple stemmed nozzle heads and essentially also does not lead to the undesired discrete ribbon like dispensing of the paste from the nozzle for the purpose of filling.<br>
The broader openings provide for thick and complete filling at faster rate as compared to the narrower nozzle openings of the known art nozzle, which facilitate faster filling of the toothpaste tube as compared to the conventional nozzles.<br>
Importantly, the valve which is provided in the opening of the insert ensures that while filling there is no over flow of the material into the insert opening to create contamination of the different paste materials.<br><br>
The broader opening of the filling nozzle further avoids non-uniform lengths of filling and thereby ensures that the annular region inside the tubular toothpaste surrounding the insert is uniformly filled. All this in turn ensure proper and effective dispensing of striped paste from the container.<br>
Preferably, the nozzle rear end is constructed and dimensioned so as to fit to any conventional filling apparatus. While it is possible to vary the dimensions of the nozzle as well as the number of openings at the front face for the desired bulk jet feeding surrounding the insert but usually the nozzle dimensions would involve a cylindrical body of diameter in the range of 15 to 50mm preferably 15 to 25mm, length of 20 to 50mm preferably 25 to 35 mm. The valve is provided either at the front face or Internally between the front and rear ends of the body. Preferably, the valve can be provided at a distance of about 0 to 10mm preferably 5 to 8 mm from the front face so that the paste material is properly fed in bulk jet around the insert while carrying out the filling operation.<br>
In accordance with another aspect the present invention provides for improved method of filling striping paste in toothpaste tubes following the insert technology by using the above disclosed nozzle of the invention.<br>
The objects of the invention and its advantages are explained hereunder in greater detail in relation to the non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the accompanying figures wherein -<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of the filling nozzle in accordance with the prior art.<br>
Figure 2 is a front view of the nozzle of figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 is a rear view of the nozzle of figure 1.<br>
Figure 4 is a side view of the improved nozzle for filling in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
Figure 5 is a front view of the improved nozzle of figure 4.<br>
Figure 6 is a rear view of the improved nozzle of figure 4.<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates in side view a conventional filling nozzle for filling toothpaste tubes following the insert technology. As illustrated in the said figure 1 the nozzle comprises a cylindrical main body (CB) which at the rear end (RE) has an opening which communicates with a source of the feeding material (paste). At the front end (FE) the cylindrical main body is provided with plurality of protruding nozzle heads (NZ). Such nozzle heads (NZ) are disposed in a circular orientation as clearly illustrated in figure 2. For filling purposes the rear end opening and the multiple nozzle head opening are in operative communication.<br>
As shown in figure 3 the rear end has a central opening (CO) through which the material to be filled gets into the cylindrical body. Thereafter the material is routed through the respective nozzle through corresponding openings (O) formed in the peripheral region of an intermediate member (IM) internally supported with respect to the cylindrical body.<br>
For the purpose of filling using such conventional nozzle, the nozzle heads i.e. its front end is disposed with respect to the insert such that the plurality of the nozzle heads surround the insert. Also in the process of such disposition the insert central opening is closed by way of the interrnediate member (IM) which sets against opening of the insert.<br>
While such disposition of nozzle heads is completed, the filling material (paste) is forced through the extended nozzle heads in the annular region surrounding the insert. As explained above, the provision of such protruding nozzles with narrow opening necessarily lead to dispensing of the paste in the form of noodles. Moreover, the flow of the paste through each of the nozzle head is found to be non-uniform particularly with high CV/ viscosity pastes, resulting in non-uniform filling of the annular zone. Moreover, the passage of the respective nozzle heads being of very small dimension, occasionally some of the nozzle heads get clogged resulting in further problems in achieving uniform filling of the annular zone. All these lead to slow filling, loss/contamination of paste and finally nonÂ¬uniform dispensing of stripped paste which affected consumer acceptability.<br><br>
Moreover, the narrow configuration of the nozzle head opening added to the problems of cleaning and maintenance of such nozzles which again affected the desired cleanliness and hygiene required in such devices for filling sensitive materials which come in oral contact.<br>
The problems of the nozzles of prior art described above are obviated by the use of the improved nozzle of the invention illustrated in greater details in Figures 4 to 6.<br>
Figure 4 illustrates in side view the improved nozzle in accordance with the present invention. The improved nozzle has a cylindrical body (CB) having a front end (FE) and a rear end (RE). As in case of the nozzle under figure 1 above, the rear end communicates with a source of the paste material to be filled while the front end facilitates the filling of the paste in the annular region surrounding the insert internally of a toothpaste tube for dispensing striped paste.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the front end of the nozzle according to the invention. In this case the use of extended multipule nozzle heads are avoided to solve the problems of nodular non-uniform fillihg of paste. Instead, according to the embodiment illustrated three broad outlets (OT) are provided to facilitate the filling of the paste surrounding the insert as required for carrying out the filling involving the insert technology. The valve (CP) is located substantially centrally close to the front end and supported with respect to the cylindrical body. The valve blocks the central opening of the insert at the time of the filling. The valve is held with respect to the cylindrical body by means of connecting spaced apart connectors (BR). Importantly, while three such connectors result in three broad spaced outlets according to the present embodiment it is also possible to use one connector which will provide one big annular.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates the rear view of the nozzle in accordance with the present invention. The central opening (CO) at the rear communicates with the source for the paste material which then for the purpose of filling is allowed to traverse through the outlets (OT) in the front face for a desired bulk jet filling of the annular<br><br>
zone surrounding the insert. The figure further illustrates the valve (CP) as seen in the rear view.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the above discussed improved nozzle to achieve a more uniform and faster filling of striping paste in toothpaste tubes using the insert technology. Importantly, the nozzle of the invention dispenses the striping paste around the striping insert as a bulk jet thereby filling the paste in uniform manner.<br>
The nozzle enables achieving uniform striping throughout the tube length free of color contamination in tip during initial squeeze, permits wider fluctuations in paste cohesion values / rheology.<br>
The nozzle and uniform filling achieved there through would enable providing tooth paste dispensers where the paste could be dispensed smoothly with uniform striping. Importantly, the nozzle achieves paste dispensing smoothly with a clean ribbon cut off at nozzle up without requiring air jet. In view of avoiding of the complexities of stemmed multiple nozzle head filling, the bulk of the paste material can be filled at a faster rate with optimum use of the striping material. The nozzle is developed so that it can be effectively cleaned and maintained such that it also takes care of required cleanliness and hygiene to feed such sensitive materials such as toothpaste and the like which necessarily come into oral contact.<br>
Importantly, the nozzle of the invention facilitates the dispensing of the striping paste in a bulk jet form whereby the paste stacks as uniform bed around the insert. Moreover the valve provision blocks the insert opening during the filling cycle thereby ensuring that there is no over flow in the insert and consequential contamination of the paste varieties required for stripe. The ribbon cut off is clean at the nozzle tip. All these features of the nozzle of the invention would provide for improving the speed of the filling, avoid color contamination at tip, lower tolerance to CV / Theological variations of paste P during initial squeeze and further avoid striping quality variations.<br><br>
The nozzle is therefore directed to serve in improving overall the method of filling stripe paste following the insert technology thereby making available good quality stripe toothpaste and the like at cost effective rates to the ultimate consumer.<br><br>
