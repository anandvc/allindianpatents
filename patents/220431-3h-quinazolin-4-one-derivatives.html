In another aspect the present invention provides a compound of formula I wherein<br>
R'   is -(CH2)„-C0-NR'R'; -(CH2)„-C00R^ -(CH2)n^NR'R^ -(CH2)n-CN; ^(CHoJn-OR^<br>
or phenyl, which is unsubstituted or substituted by one to three substituents selected<br>
from halogen and fluoro(C]-C6)-aIk}'l; '^   is hydrogen or Ci-Ce-alkyl;<br>
R'   is hydrogen, Ci-Ce-alkyl, Cs-Cg-cycloalk}'! or benz)i;<br>
R^   is halogen, fluaro(Ci-C6)-alk7l, cyano, Ci-Ce-alkoxy or fluoro(Ci-Q)-all;o}:&gt;'; R^ and R^ are independently from each other hydrogen or CrC6-aIk}d; R'   is hydrogen or Ci-Ce-alkyl; R^   is hydrogen or Ci-Q-alkyl;<br><br>
Ji    is 1,2 or 3; and<br>
a     is 0,1 or 2;<br>
as well as their pharmaceutically ai ceptable salts.<br>
It has been found that the compou nds of general formula I are selective monoamine oxid¬ase B inhibitors.<br>
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1. !:.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenaus monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrei aUne, and trace amines, e.g. phenyl ethyl-amine, as weU asanumherofaminexenobiotics. The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes [Bach :t a!., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:4934-4938 (1988)] and differing ia tissue distributior, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamint, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenyli thylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO- 3 is widely distributed in several organs including brain [Cesura and Pletscher, Prog. Dru{ Research 38:171-297 (1992)]. Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging [Fowler et al., J. Neural. Tn nsm. 49:1-20 (1980)]. Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains 
c	<br>
hibitors may act by both reducin j the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br>
Given the implication of MAO-I in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain p jtent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known IVL'IO-B inhibitors is, e.g., discussed by Bentu^-Ferrer et al. in CNS Drugs 6:217-236 (1996). \'VhereaE a major limita¬tion of irreversible and non-.9ele. :tive MAO inhibitor activit}'is the need to observe dietary<br><br>
:irecautions due to the risk of indi cing a hypertensive crisis when dietary t)TarDine is in¬vested, as well as the potential for nteractions with other medications [Gardner et al., I. lilin. Psychiatry 57:99-104 (1996) , these adverse events are of less concern with reversible md selective MAO inhibitors, in j 'articular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity a id without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivi ty for the enzyme.<br>
It has been found that compound i of formula I of the present invention and their pharma-ceuticaHy acceptable salt show the potential to be highly selective MAO-B inhibitors. Sub¬jects of the present invention are : iirther a process for the manufacture of compounds of formula I as well as medicaments based on a compound in accordance with the invention and their manufacture as well as t he use of the compounds in the control or prevention of diseases mediated by monoamine oxidase B inhibitors, and, respectively, for the produc¬tion of corresponding medicamej its.<br>

  (V)<br><br>
vherein<br>
.^'   is -(CH2)„-C0-NK^R^; -(CHz)n-COOR^; -(CH2)„-NRV; -(CH2)n-CN; -(CH2)n-0R^;<br>

and optionally converting the resulting compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.<br>
In one embodiment the compounds of general formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be manufactured by reacting a compound of formula II<br><br><br>
and, if desired, converting a compound of formula I into a pharroaceutically acceptable<br>
salt, or alternatively,<br>
reacting a compound of formula VI<br><br>
to obtain a compound of formula IV which in turn is reacted with a compound of formula<br>
V to obtain a compound of formula I<br>
and, if desired, converting a compound of formula I into a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt<br>
In accordance with the present invention, compounds of general formula I can be pre¬<br>
pared following scheme 1: 2-Amino-4-fluorobenzoic acid VIII is heated in the presence of<br>
formam.idine acetate IX which after basification of the reaction medium affords com¬<br>
pounds of type Ila. Subsequent reaction with the sodium salts of ben2ylic alcohols of type<br>
X affords compounds of type IVa which are then dissolved in l-methyl-2-pyrrohdone	(<br>
(NMP) and treated with sodium hydride and an electrophile of formula V to give com¬pounds of formula I, wherein R^ is hydrogen.<br><br><br><br>
Alternatiyel)', compounds of genera] formula J can be prepared according to the following scheme 2: 4-Fluoro-2-nitro-benzonitrile XI is heated in the presence of HBr and the re¬sulting acid XII is esterified with acidic methanol to afford a compound of formula XIII. Subsequent reaction with the sodium salts of benzj'Hc alcohols of type X affords com¬pounds of type XTV, which are then hydrogenated to anilines of formula VI. Treatment with acetamidate hydrochloride of type VII in base (usually sodium methoxide) forms the quinazolinones IV which are then alkylated with compounds of type V to form the target compounds of formula I.<br><br><br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be maniifactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the com¬pound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric add, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceuti¬cally acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesjun or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceu-ticaDy acceptable salts of acidic compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acut and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, other t)'pes of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease. Other indications include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabohc dis¬orders such as obesity as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced.by.ahuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indica¬tions maybe reward deficiency syndrome (WO 01/34172), peripheral neuropathy caused by cancer chemotherapy (WO 97/33572), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis {WO 96/40095) and other neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br><br>
The cDNA's encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by Schlaeger and Christensen [Cytotechnology, 15:1-13 (1998)]. After transfection, cells were homogeneised by means of a Polytron homogeneiser in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyi fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by centrifugation at 45,000 xg and, after two rinsing step with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, membranes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80 "C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectro-photometric assay adapted from the method described by Zhou and Panchuk-VolosHna [Analytical Biochemistry 253:169-174 (1997)]. Briefly, membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37°C with or without various concentrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the MAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/ml horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 pM N-acetyl-3,7,-diliydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37°C in a final volume of 200 [il and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 (iM dorgyline for !MAO-A or 10 pM L-deprenyl for MAO-B. ICso values were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The activities of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 10 fiM or Jess, typically of ] (iM or less, and ideally 0.3 (iM or less.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical prepa¬rations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the admimstra-I     tion can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenteraUy, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I andpharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be pro¬cessed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid<br><br>
or its salts and the like can be used, e.g., as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, e.g-, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine cap¬sules. Suitable ca.rriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, e.g., water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble saltsofcompoundsof formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, e.g., natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, soiubilizers,	"'<br>
stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceuti-caHy acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutical!)' valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of comrse, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described.
