BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.       The present invention relates to a servo error detecting apparatus for recording data and/ or reproducing data from a disk. This invention has been divided<br>
out of Indian Patent Application No.733/CAL/99.   It also describes a method<br>
for detecting servo error by comparing the levels of synchronous signals recorded on the header area of a disk, an apparatus suitable for the method, a disk which guarantees the quality of a push-pull signal which is the basis of optimally controlling the servo, a method for controlling the servo of the recording/reproducing apparatus, a method for detecting a tracking error, and a method for detecting a tilt error.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
The quality of a signal remarkably deteriorates due to a servo error such as the tilt and detrack of a disk as recording density becomes higher not only in a disk only for reproduction such as a DVD-ROM but also in a recordable disk such as a DVD-RAM. In particular, in the recordable disk, recording quality deteriorates due to the influence of the servo error when the servo error exists during recording and the deterioration of the quality of the signal becomes severe due to the servo error during the reproduction of a concerned part.<br>
In a DVD-RAM disk, information is recorded on a track. The track is comprised of a land track and a groove track. The land track and the groove track alternate when the disk rotates once. The land track and the groove track are alternated in the DVD-RAM disk in order to provide a tracking guide in an initial stage and to reduce crosstalk between adjacent tracks in a high density narrow track.<br>
The track is comprised of sectors haying a uniform length. A pre-embossed header area is provided during the manufacture         of         the         disk         as        a        means         of<br>
-1A-<br><br>
physically dividing the sectors.  The physical addresses of the sectors are recorded in the pre-embossed header area.<br>
      Each sector is comprised of a header area in which physical identification data (PID) is recorded and a data area.<br>
      FIG; 1A shows the physical shape of the land track in a DVD-RAM disk. FIG. 1B shows the waveform of a push-pull signal in the land track.<br>
      The header area is repeatedly arranged in every sector of the track.  Four PIDs (PID1 through PID4) having the same value are recorded in one header area. The PID1 and the PID2 are arranged to deviate from the center of the track by a certain amount and the PID3 and the PID4 are arranged to deviate from the center of the track to a direction opposite to that of the PID1 and PID2 so that the PIDs can be correctly read even if a laser spot 22 deviates from the center of the track. Also, the arrangements of the PID1 and PID2 and the PID3 and PID4 in the land track are opposite to those in the groove track.  The push-pull signal shown in FIG. 1B can be obtained in the land track.<br>
      FIG. 2A shows the physical shape of the groove track in a DVD-RAM disk. FIG. 2B shows the waveforrn of the push-pull signal in the groove track.<br>
      FIG. 3 shows the enlarged header area shown in FIGs. 1A through 2A. In the structure of the header area, the PID1 and PID2 and the PID3 and PID4 are arranged to deviate from the center of the track in opposite directions by a uniform amount. A vfo signal having a specified frequency for synchronizing and detecting ID and an ID signal showing the physical addresses of the sectors are recorded in the respective PIDs.  The vfo signal has a recording pattern of 4T (T is a period of the clock signal).<br>
      As shown in FIG. 3, the header area is comprised of vfo1 33 and ID1 (PID1) 34, vfo2 35 and ID2 (PID2) 36, vfo3 37 and ID3 (PID3) 38, and vfo4 39 and ID4 (PID4) 40.<br>
      In FIG. 3, when the laser spot passes through the header area of the -groove track, a push-pull signal RF_pp shown in FIG. 4A and a sum signal RF_sum shown in FIG. 4B are obtained.   In FIG. 4A, a vfo1 signal 42 corresponds to the vfo1 signal area 33 of FIG. 3. A vfo3 signal 43 corresponds to the vfo3 signal area 37.<br>
2<br><br>
      FIG. 5 shows the structure of an apparatus for obtaining the push-pull signal shown in FIG. 4A and the sum signal shown in FIG. 4B.  In FIG. 5, reference numeral 50 denotes a photodetector divided into four sections. Reference numerals 52 and 54 denote adders.   Reference numeral 56 denotes a calculator.<br>
      The apparatus shown in FIG. 5 outputs the sum signal RF_sum of signals detected by light receiving elements A through D of the photodetector divided into four, sum signals V1 and V2 of radial pairs B and C, and A and D of respective light receiving elements, and the push-pull signal RF_pp which is a subtraction signal V2-V1 of V1 and V2.<br>
      FIG. 10 shows a conventional technology for compensating for tilt and a method for detecting the amount of tilt by a specific pattern recorded on the track of a disk.  The specific pattern coincides with the proceeding direction of the track and the center of the track and is realized in the form of a reference pit A and/or a reference pit B.<br>
      It is possible to obtain tilt information by comparing signals reproduced from the reference patterns shown in FIG. 10 with each other and to thus operate a tilt compensating equipment according to the obtained tilt information or to compensate for the signals by changing the equalizer coefficient of the reproducing signal.<br>
      The reference patterns shown in FIG. 10 are located in an arbitrary position in the disk and are useful for detecting tangential tilt (tilt in a track direction).<br>
      However, in the conventional technology shown in FIG. 10, the length of the reference pattern for detecting the tilt is too short. Another pattern is necessary in order to detect the correct position of the tilt pattern.  Also, radial tilt (tilt in a radial direction) cannot be detected.  Since the radial tilt is larger than the tangential tilt in practice, the reference patterns are not so useful.<br>
      Since it is necessary to precisely manage the servo for the recording/reproducing apparatus to maintain an optimal recording/reproducing state, it is necessary to manage the servo error signal in high resolution.<br>
      However, the precision of the servo error signal varies depending on the disk or the reproducing apparatus. Accordingly, it is difficult to precisely manage the servo.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
      Hereinafter, the structure and operation of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
      For example, in a push-pull signal, the ratio of the magnitude of the signal PID1 and PID2 to the magnitude of the signal PID3 and PID4 varies by up to 30%, depending on the disk. When such a signal is used as a reference signal for controlling a servo, it is difficult to precisely manage the servo and maintain optimal recording/reproducing states.<br>
      In the method for detecting the servo error according to the present invention, a servo error &amp; detected by the, ratio of the magnitude of reference patterns regularly recorded on a disk to the magnitude of a reproducing signal corresponding to the reference patterns.  Reference patterns could include a synchronous signal recorded in a header area and a wobble signal recorded in the direction of the track of a disk.<br>
      First, a method for detecting the servo error using the synchronous signal recorded in the header area will be described. When the optical axis of a laser spot is vertical to the header area, namely, when tilt in a radial direction does not occur, the magnitude (Ivfo1) of a detected vfo1 signal is approximately equal to<br>
6<br><br>
the magnitude (ivfo3) of a vfo3 signal.   However, in the case that tilt or detrack occurs, when either the Ivfo1 or the ivfo3 becomes large, the other becomes small.<br>
      This is because the intensity of light reflected from the PID1 and PID2 and the PIO3 and PID4, which are arranged to deviate from the center of the track in opposite directions, varies in relation to the tilt of the disk although the light spot tracks the center of the track. When the disk is tilted to the inner side, the intensity of light reflected from an upper header (a peak header) is larger than that reflected from a lower header (a bottom header) as shown in FIGs. 1A through 2A.<br>
      Accordingly, the ratio of the magnitude Ivfo1 of the vfo1 signal to the magnitude ivfo3 of the vfo3 signal varies. Also, the ratio of the magnitude Ivfo2,of a vfo2 signal to the magnitude Ivfo4 of a vfo4 signal varies.<br>
      In order to detect the degree to which the magnitude ratio varies, a signal recorded at a uniform level should be used.  Since a vfo signals have uniform levels and frequencies, the vfo signals are suitable for this purpose, Also, it is easier to detect the magnitude of the vfo1 and vfo3 signals than that of the vfo2 and vfo4 signals.<br>
      Here, when the magnitudes of the synchronous signals detected in vfo1 and vfo3 areas are Ivfo1 and Ivfo3, a balance value K is defined as follows.<br><br>
or<br>
or<br><br>
wherein, to is the magnitude of the sum signal RF sum in the mirror area.<br>
      In Equations 1 and 2, the balance value is calculated using the magnitude of the synchronous signals detected from the areas vfo1 and vfo3.  While it is possible to calculate the balance value using the magnitude of the synchronous signals detected from the areas vfo2 and vfo4, it is easier to detect the synchronous signals from the areas vfo1 and vfo3 than from the areas vfo2 and vfo4. Also, it is possible to use the value obtained by the combination of the<br>
7<br><br>
synchronous signals detected in the areas vfo1 and vfo2 and the value obtained by the combination of the synchronous signals detected in the areas vfo3 and vfo4.<br>
      When the balance value K obtained in the case that there is no servo error is K0, and the balance value K obtained in the case that a servo error exists is K1, the difference between the two values is defined as follows.<br>
Kt=K0-K1	...(3)<br>
      Namely, it is possible to know the direction and magnitude of the servo error according to the value and sign of Kt.<br>
      Here, K0 may be the value measured in a state where there is no servo error, a default value determined by the system controller of a recording/reproducing apparatus, or a value measured in a reference state determined by the system.<br>
      In the land track and the groove track, the polarity of K1 should vary in order to calculate Kt correctly since the position of PID1 and PID2 and the position of PID3 and PID4 are inversed.<br>
      A method for detecting the servo error of the disk using the wobble signal will now be described.  Wobble is formed in the land track and the groove track in the DVD-RAM disk.   The wobble is in the form' of a sinusoidal wave formed on the side wall of the track.<br>
      When the disk is tilted in a radial direction, the wobble signal is tilted in the radial direction.  Namely, the magnitude of the wobble signal varies between two arbitrary points separated from each other in the radial direction.  Therefore, it is possible to detect tilt by detecting the amount of change of the wobble signal in the radial direction.<br>
      FIG. 6 is a block diagram showing the structure of a preferred embodiment of the apparatus for detecting the servo error signal according to the present invention.  The apparatus shown in FIG. 6 includes a reproducing signal generator 62, a header area detector 64, a first synchronous signal level detector 66, a second synchronous signal level detector 68, a balance calculator 70, a<br><br>
comparator 72, a land/groove detector 76, a tilt controller 74, a polarity inverter 78, and a detrack compensator 80.<br>
      The reproducing signal generator 62 generates a sum signal RF_sum, sum signals V1 and V2 of radial pairs, and a push-pull signal RF_pp obtained by subtracting V1 from V2. The reproducing signal generator 62 includes the photodetector divided into four and a calculator as shown in FIG. 5.<br>
The header area detector 64 generates header area signals (a header area signal 1 and a header area signal 2) showing the header area from the reproducing signal.  Here, the header area signal 1 notifies the PID1 and PID2 areas.  The header area signal 2 notifies the PID3 and PID4 areas.  Since the header area has an envelope larger than that of the data area, it is possible to : obtain a header area signal showing the header area using both an envelope detector for detecting the envelope of the reproducing signal and the comparator. The first synchronous signal level detector 66 synchronized with the header area signal 1 generated by the header area detector 64 detects the magnitude Ivfo1 of the vfo1 signal shown in FIG. 4.  To be specific, a first enable signal (enable 1). having a predetermined width and separated from the starting point of the header area signal 1 by a predetermined distance is generated.  After gating the reproducing signal by the first enable signal (enable 1), the magnitude Ivfo1 of the vfo1 signal is detected by detecting the peak-to-peak value of the reproducing signal.<br>
      The second synchronous-signal level-detector 68 synhronized with the header area signal 2 generated by the header area detector 64 detects the magnitude of the vfo3 signal shown in FIG. 4.  To be specific, the magnitude Ivfo3 of the vfo3 signal is detected by generating a second enable signal (enable 2) having a predetermined width and separated from the starting point of the header area signal 2, gating a reproducing signal by the second enable signal (enable 2), and detecting the peak-to-peak value of the gated reproducing signal.<br>
      The balance calculator 70 calculates the ratio of the magnitude Ivfo1 of the vfo1 signal detected by the first synchronous signal level detector 66 to the magnitude Ivfo3 of the vfo3 signal detected by the second synchronous signal level detector 68 as shown in Equation 1.  Here, the balance calculator 70 can<br>
9<br><br>
output the mean value of the balance values obtained from several successive sectors in the radial or tangential direction.<br>
      The comparator 72 compares the balance value Kt calculated by the balance calculator 70 with a predetermined reference value K0 and outputs the difference between the two values Kt shown in Equation 3.  Here, K0 may be a value measured in a state where there is no tilt, a default value determined by the system controller of the recording/reproducing apparatus, or a value measured in the reference state determined by the system.<br>
      The land/groove detector 76 receives the reproducing signal and detects whether the current track is the land track or the groove track.   In the push-pull signal of the land track, the magnitude of the PID1 and PID2 is smaller than that of PID3 and PID4 as shown in FIG. 1B.  In the push-pull signal of the groove track, the magnitude of PID1 and PID2 is smaller than the magnitude of the PID3 and PID4.  The land/groove detector 76 discriminates the land track from the groove track using the above.<br>
      The polarity inverter 78 inverts the_polarity of the subtraction value K1 output from the comparator 72 according to the result detected by the land/groove detector 76.<br>
The balance value can be used in order to compensate for tilt.<br>
      The tilt controller 74 controls the tilt of the disk according to the subtraction value Kt the polarity of which is inverted and which is output from the polarity inverter 78.  Since the sign and magnitude of the subtraction value Kt show the direction and magnitude of the tilt, the tilt of the disk is controlled by feeding back the sign and the magnitude of the subtraction value Kt<br>
The balance value can be used in order to correct detrack.<br>
      The detrack compensator 80 controls the detrack of the disk according to the subtraction value Kt the polarity of which is inverted and which is output from the polarity inverter 78.  Since the sign and magnitude of the subtraction value Kt shows the direction and magnitude of the detrack, the detrack of the disk is controlled by feeding back the subtraction value Kt..<br>
      FIG. 7 shows the waveforms of the operation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 6. FIG. 7A shows the waveform of the push-pull signal generated by the reproducing signal generator 62.  FIGs. 7B and 7C show the waveforms of the<br>
10<br><br>
header area signal 1 and the header area signal 2, respectively, generated by the header area signal generator.  FIGs. 7D and 7E show the waveforms of the first enable signal (enable 1) and the second enable signal (enable 2) used by the first synchronous signal level detector 66 and the second synchronous signal level detector 68.<br>
      FIG. 8 is a block diagram showing the structure of another embodiment of the apparatus for generating the servo error signal according to the present invention.  The apparatus shown in FIG. 8 is similar to the apparatus shown in FIG. 6 except that the apparatus includes a mirror area signal generator 86 and a mirror signal level detector 88.  Therefore, the same reference numerals are used for the same members and a detailed description thereof is omitted.<br>
      The mirror area signal generator 86 generates a mirror area signal showing a mirror area from the sum signal RF_sum provided by the reproducing signal generator 62.  In the push-pull signal RF_pp, since the mirror signal becomes zero, it is not possible to obtain the mirror area signal by the push-pull signal RF_pp.<br>
      It is possible to generate the mirror area signal by the envelope detector and the comparator since the mirror signal has a much lower envelope than the signals of the data area and the header area.<br>
      The mirror signal level detector 88 detects the level of the mirror signal from the sum signal RF_sum by the mirror area signal generated by the mirror area signal generator 86. The mirror signal level detector 88 generates a third enable signal (enable 3) having a predetermined period by the mirror area signal generated by the mirror area signal generator, gates the sum signal RF_sum by the third enable signal (enable 3), and detects the peak-to-peak value of the gated sum signal RF_sum.<br>
      The balance calculator 72 calculates the balance value Kt as shown in Equation 2 by the level Ivfo1 of the vfo1 signal detected by the first synchronous signal level detector 66, the level Ivfo3 of the vfo3 signal detected by the second synchronous signal level detector 68, and the mirror signal level to detected by the mirror signal level detector 88.  Here, the balance calculator 72 can output the mean value of the balance values obtained from several successive sectors in the radial or tangential direction.<br>
11<br><br>
      FIGs. 9A and 9B show waveforms during the operation of the apparatus shown in FIG. 8.  FIG.-9A shows the waveform of the mirror area signal output from the mirror area signal generator 86.  FIG. 9B shows the waveform of the third enable signal (enable 3).<br>
      According to the present invention, it is possible to use the push-pull signal RF_pp, the sum signals V1 and V2 of the radial pairs, and the sum signal RF_sum for detecting the servo error since the servo error is detected by the balance value of the synchronous signals.  For example, when the push-pull signal RF_pp is used, it is possible to compensate for tilt in the radial direction.  When the sum signal RF_sum is used, it is possible to compensate for tilt in the tangential direction.<br>
      FIG. 11 is a graph showing the relationship between the radial tilt and the balance value K in the method and apparatus according to the present invention. In FIG. 11, the horizontal axis denotes radial tilt values and the vertical axis denotes balance values K.   In FIG. 11, the graph marked with ? shows a case where the sum signal RF_sum and the balance value according to Equation 1 are used.  The graph marked with ? shows a case where the sum signal RF_sum and the balance value according to Equation 2 are used.  The graph marked with • shows a case where the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 2 are used.  The graph marked with ? shows a case where the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 1 are used.<br>
      As shown in FIG. 11, the radial tilt is best described by the case marked with ? where the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 1 are used.  The case marked with • where the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 2 are used is also useful for describing the radial tilt.<br>
      Therefore, it is possible to determine the tilt by the values according to Equations 1 and 2 using the push-pull signal RF_pp.<br>
      FIG. 12 is a graph showing the relationship between the detrack and the balance value K in the method and apparatus according to the present invention. In FIG. 12, the horizontal axis denotes the amount of the detrack.  The vertical axis denotes the balance value K.   In FIG. 12, the graph marked with A shows a case where the sum signal RF_sum and the balance value according to Equation<br>
12<br><br>
1 are used.  The graph marked with ? shows a case where the sum signal RF_sum and the balance value according to Equation 2 are used. The graph marked with • shows a case where the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 2 are used. The graph marked with ? shows a case where the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 1 are used.<br>
      As shown in FIG. 12, the graph marked with ? which shows the case where the sum signal RF_sum and the balance value according to Equation 1 is most affected by the detrack.  The graph marked with ? which shows the case where the push-pull signal RF"_pp and the balance value according to Equation 1 is least affected by the detrack.<br>
      Therefore, it is possible to determine the detrack by the value according to Equation 1 or 2 using the sum signal RF_sum.<br>
      As shown in FIGs. 11 and 12, it is possible to most effectively detect the amount of tilt when the push-pull signal RF_pp and the balance value according to Equation 1 are used.<br>
      The quality of the servo error signal varies according to the quality of the disk and the conditions of the system.  However, when the value of the servo error signal is not restricted to some degree, it is not possible to recognize the PID or it is difficult to stably manage the servo. Therefore, in the disk, the valueK0 is preferably managed to maintain a prescribed level.<br>
      Accordingly, in the present invention, it is suggested that the value K0 be restricted to ±0.1. This value is required to normally reproduce the PID when a standard amount of tilt ±0.35 ° is given. Also, the allowance range of the track control is considered.<br>
      Also, it is necessary to restrict the value Kt to no more than a predetermined value to precisely control the servo in the apparatus for reproducing data from the disk. When the quality of the servo is not strictly managed when the data is reproduced, it is not possible to obtain the PID information.<br>
      Therefore, in the present invention, it is suggested that the value Kt be restricted to ±0.1 in the servo operation of the reproducing apparatus.<br>
13<br><br>
      It is possible to correctly detect the tilt state of the disk without a specific pattern for detecting the servo error by the method for detecting the servo error according to the present invention.<br>
      It is possible for the recording/reproducing apparatus to stably control the servo and to maintain an optimal recording/reproducing state since the apparatus for generating the servo error signal according to the present invention correctly detects the servo error state of the disk.<br>
      It is possible for the recording/reproducing apparatus to stably control the servo and to maintain the optimal recording/reproducing state since it is possible to strictly manage the level of the servo error signal which is the basis of controlling the servo by the disk according to the present invention.<br>
