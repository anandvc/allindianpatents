				<td>TETRYDROCARBAZO DERIVATIVES AS LGANDS FOR<br>
PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCR)<br>
The present invention relates to novel tetrahydro-<br>
carbazole derivatives which are ligands of G-protein<br>
coupled receptors, and especially antagonists of<br>
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, to the preparation<br>
thereof, to the use thereof, and to the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions- which include these tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
derivatives. The present invention also relates to a<br>
method for treating pathological states mediated by G-<br>
protein coupled receptors in a mammal, in particular a<br>
human.<br>
Technical background<br>
The structural element which is common to all members<br>
of the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) is<br>
the presence of seven transmembrane alpha-helical<br>
segments which are connected together by alternating<br>
intra- and extracellular loops, with the amino terminus<br>
being located on the extracellular side and the carboxy<br>
terminus being located on the intracellular side. The<br>
family of GPCRs can be divided into a plurality of<br>
subfamilies (essentially family A, B and C) with<br>
further sequence homologies within these subfamilies.<br>
Since GPCRs are mainly involved in signal reception and<br>
transduction, a large number of physiological functions<br>
are influenced by them. GPCR ligands are therefore<br>
potentially suitable as medicaments for the therapy and<br>
prophylaxis of a large number of pathological states. A<br>
brief survey of diseases which can be treated with GPCR<br>
ligands is given in S. Wilson et al., Pharmaceutical'<br>
News 2000, 7(3) in Table 1.<br>
The majority of known GPCR ligands has a peptide<br>
structure. However, peptide receptor ligands frequently<br>
have some serious disadvantages such as, for example,<br><br>
low bioavailability and metabolic instability. This is<br>
why there has recently been an intensified search for<br>
ligands in the form of small, non-peptide molecules. A<br>
special part is played in the search for novel, non-<br>
5 peptide receptor ligands by so-called "privileged<br>
structures'". These "privileged structures" are the<br>
basic molecular structures which provide ligands for a<br>
large number of different receptors. The term<br>
"privileged structures" was used for the first time by<br>
1.0 Evans et al. in connection with benzodiazepine-based<br>
CCK (cholecys-tokinin) A antagonists from the natural<br>
product asperlicin (B.E. Evans et al. , J. Med. Chem.<br>
1988, 31, 2235) . For proteases for example it has been<br>
known for some time that certain structural classes can<br>
15 serve as inhibitors of various enzymes. Whereas<br>
descriptions in the past were in particular of<br>
mechanism-based inhibitors of various proteases,<br>
however, more recently the frequency of examples of<br>
compounds which, by reason of their three-dimensional<br>
20 structure, fit well into the active binding region of<br>
various enzymes has increased (cf. M. Whittaker, Cur.<br>
Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998, 2, 386; A.S. Ripka et al. ,<br>
ibid., 441). Such "privileged structures" have already<br>
been described for GPCRs too. Examples thereof are,<br>
25 besides the aforementioned benzodiazepines, also<br>
peptoids, 4-substituted 4-arylpiperidines, but also<br>
specific rigidized Î²-turnimetics (B.A. Bunin et al. ,<br>
Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 1999, 34, 267; R.N. Zuckermann et<br>
al., J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2678; G.C.B. Harriman,<br>
30 Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41, 8853) . A review of this is<br>
to be found in A.A. Patchett et al. , Ann. Rep. Med.<br>
Chem. 1999, 35, 289. The tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
derivatives of the present invention provide a further<br>
class of "privileged structures" for GPCRs.<br>
35<br>
Although the present invention provides ligands for<br>
GPCRs in general, the compounds provided by the present<br>
invention are suitable in particular as ligands for a<br>
particular representative of the class of GPCRs, namely<br><br>
gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH receptor). GnRH receptor can be<br>
assigned to subfamily A of GPCRs (cfU.Gether et al., Endocrine Reviews 2000, 21(1),<br>
90).<br>
GnRH is a hormone which is synthesized predominantly, but not exclusively, in<br>
mammals by nerve cells of the hypothalamus, is transported via the portal vein into the<br>
pituitary and is delivered in a controlled mannerto gonadotropic cells. Interaction of<br>
GnRH with its receptor having seven transmembrane domains stimulates the production<br>
and release of gonadotropic hormones by means of me second messenger inositol 1,4, 5-<br>
trisphosphate and Ca24 ions. Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone<br>
(FSH), which are gonadotropins released by GnRH, stimulate the production of sex<br>
steroidsd and gamete maturation in both sexes. In addition to GnRH ( also referred to as<br>
GnRHl), there are two further forms of GnRH, namely GnRH2 and 3.<br>
the GnRH receptor is used as pharmacological target in a number of disorders which<br>
depend on functioning sex hormone production, for example prostrate cancer,<br>
premenopausal breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine fibroids. GnRH superagonists or<br>
antagonists can be employed successfully for these disorders. A further possible<br>
indication is, in particular, male fertility control in combination with a replacement dose<br>
of androgens.<br>
One advantage of GnRH antagonists compared with GnRH superagonists is (heir<br>
direct activity in blocking gonadotropoin secretion. Superagonists initially bring<br>
about overstimulation of the pituitary, leading to increased gonadotropin release and<br>
sex steroid release. This hormonal response is terminated only after a certain delay<br>
on the basis of desensitization and downregulation of GnRH receptor<br>
concentrations. It is therefore possible that GnRH superagonists, both alone<br><br>
and in combination with testosterone, are unable<br>
effectively to suppress sperm production in men and are<br>
thus unsuitable for male fertility control. In contrast<br>
to this, peptide GnRH antagonists, especially in<br>
combination with a replacement dose of androgen, are<br>
able to induce a significant oligozoospermia in humans.<br>
However, peptide GnRH antagonists have a number of<br>
disadvantages. Thus, they have a considerably lower<br>
activity as superagonists and must accordingly be<br>
administered in considerably higher dosages. In<br>
addition, their oral bioavailability is low, so that<br>
they must be administered by injection. Repeated<br>
injections in turn lead to a reduction in compliance.<br>
Furthermore, the synthesis of peptide GnRH antagonists<br>
is complicated and costly by comparison with non-<br>
peptide compounds.<br>
Quinoline derivatives are disclosed as non-peptide GnRH<br>
antagonists for example in WO 97/14682. However, it has<br>
not been possible to date to put any non-peptide GnRH<br>
antagonists on the market.<br>
Technical problem<br>
The problem on which the present invention is based is<br>
to provide novel compounds which are suitable for the<br>
treatment of GPCR-mediated pathological states and<br>
display in particular a GnRH-inhibiting (GnRH-<br>
antagonistic) effect. The novel GPCR ligands,<br>
preferably GnRH antagonists, ought where possible to be<br>
superior to known peptide compounds and represent an<br>
effective alternative or improvement in relation to<br>
known non-peptide compounds. The novel GPCR ligands,<br>
especially GnRH antagonists, should in particular have<br>
high activity and, where possible, a high oral<br>
bioavailability. Their synthesis ought moreover to be<br>
possible simply and at minimal cost. The present<br>
invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
comprising the novel non-peptide GPCR ligands, in<br>
particular GnRH antagonists.<br>
A further problem on which the present invention is<br>
based is to provide novel GPCR ligands, preferably GnRH<br>
antagonists, for use as pharmaceutical remedy and for<br>
use for producing pharmaceutical remedies, comprising<br>
the GPCR ligands, preferably GnRH antagonists.<br>
In addition,, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a method for the treatment of GPCR-mediated<br>
pathological states, in particular for inhibiting GnRH,<br>
in a mammal, in particular a human.<br>
All these problems are surprisingly solved by the<br>
provision of the novel tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives,<br>
of the pharmaceutical compositions which comprise these<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives, of the method for<br>
preparing these tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives, and of<br>
the method for the treatment of GPCR-mediated<br>
pathological states, preferably for inhibition of GnRH,<br>
in a mammal, in particular a human, through<br>
administration of the tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives<br>
or the use of the tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives for<br>
producing pharmaceutical remedies for the treatment of<br>
GPCR-mediated pathological states, in particular for<br>
GnRH inhibition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides novel<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the general<br>
formula (I).<br>
In a second aspect, pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
comprise at least one of the novel tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
derivatives of the general formula (I) are provided.<br><br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the general formula<br>
(I) for use as pharmaceutical remedy.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to<br>
the use of a tetrahydrocarbazole derivative of the<br>
general formula (I) for producing a pharmaceutical<br>
remedy for the treatment of GPCR-mediated pathological<br>
states, in particular for inhibition of GnRH. The<br>
present invention likewise relates to a method for the<br>
treatment of GPCR-mediated pathological states, in<br>
particular for inhibition of GnRH, in a mammal,<br>
preferably a human, where an effective amount of a<br>
compound of the invention of the general formula (I) is<br>
administered to the mammal, preferably the human,<br>
requiring such a treatment.<br>
The present invention additionally provides a method<br>
for preparing tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the<br>
general formula (I) . This method comprises for example<br>
the steps of condensation of a cyclohexanone<br>
derivative, which is tethered to a solid phase and is<br>
expediently substituted, with a suitably substituted<br>
phenylhydrazine derivative, a subsequent derivatization<br>
depending on the desired structure of the final<br>
compound, and finally elimination from the solid phase<br>
and isolation of the product.<br>

"Halogen atoms" include in particular fluorine,<br>
chorine, bromine and iodine atoms, particularly<br>
preferably chlorine acorns.<br>
Reference may also be made at this point to the fact<br>
that, besides the compounds of the general formula (I),<br><br>
as defined above, which are mentioned per se, the<br>
present invention also encompasses physiologically<br>
tolerated derivatives or analogs, especially also salts<br>
of these compounds.<br>
It may further be remarked at this point that the term<br>
"receptor ligand" or "ligand" is intended for the<br>
purposes of the present invention to designate any<br>
compound which binds in any manner to a receptor (in<br>
the present invention, the receptor is a GPCR receptor,<br>
preferably a GnRH receptor) and induces either an<br>
activation, inhibition or other conceivable effect on<br>
this receptor. The term "ligand" thus includes<br>
agonists, antagonists, partial agonists/antagonists and<br>
other ligands which elicit on the receptor an effect<br>
which resembles the effect of agonists, antagonists or<br>
partial agonists/antagonists. The compounds of the<br>
invention of the general formula (I) are preferably<br>
GnRH antagonists.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention are novel<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the invention of the<br>

Further representatives of novel compounds of the<br>
invention of the general formula (I), including their<br>
preparation, are indicated in the examples.<br>
The novel tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives (I) of the<br>
invention, as defined above, are ligands of GPCR and<br>
can be employed in particular for the inhibition, i.e.<br>
as antagonists, of gonadotropin-releasing hormone for<br>
example for male fertility control, fox' hormone<br><br>
therapy, for the treatment of female sub- or<br>
infertility, for female contraception and for tumor<br>
control.<br>
In male fertility control, the compounds of the<br>
invention bring about a reduction in spermatogenesis.<br>
Combined administration with androgens, e.g.<br>
testosterbne or testosterone derivatives such as, for<br>
example, testosterone esters, is preferred. The<br>
testosterone derivatives can in this case be<br>
administered for example by injection, e.g. by intra-<br>
muscular depot injection.<br>
The compounds (I) of the invention can also be employed<br>
where appropriate in combination with other hormones,<br>
e.g. estrogens or/and progestins, in hormone therapy,<br>
for example for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine<br>
leiomyomas and uterine fibroids. Combinations of the<br>
GnRH antagonists of the invention and tissue-selective<br>
partial estrogen agonists such as Raloxifen are<br>
particularly preferred. In addition, the compounds of<br>
the invention can be employed in hormones replacement<br>
therapy. The compounds (I) of the invention can<br>
moreover be employed to increase female fertility, for<br>
example by inducing ovulation, and for the treatment of<br>
sterility.<br>
On the other hand, the novel compounds (I) of the<br>
invention are also suitable for contraception in women.<br>
Thus, the GnRH antagonist of the invention can be<br>
administered on days 1 to 15 of the cycle together with<br>
estrogen, preferably with very small estrogen dosages.<br>
On days 16 to 21 of the cycle of intake, progestagen is<br>
added to the estrogen/GnRH antagonist combination. The<br>
GnRH antagonist of the invention can be administered<br>
continuously throughout the cycle. It is possible in<br>
this way to reduce the hormone dosages and thus achieve<br>
a reduction in the side effects of nonphysiological<br>
hormone levels. It. is additionally possible to achieve<br><br>
advantageous effects in women suffering from polycystic<br>
ovary syndrome and androgen-dependent disorders such as<br>
acne, seborrhea and hirsutism. An improved control of<br>
the cycle by - comparison with previous administration<br>
methods is also to be expected. Further indications are<br>
benign prostate hyperplasia, gonadal protection during<br>
chemotherapy, controlled ovary stimulation/assisted<br>
reproduction techniques, infantile development<br>
disorders, e.g. precocious puberty and polycystic<br>
ovaries.<br>
Finally, the compounds (I) of the invention, as defined<br>
above, can also be employed for the treatment of<br>
hormone-dependent neoplastic diseases such as<br>
premenopausal cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer<br>
and endometrial cancer, by suppressing endogenous sex<br>
steroid hormones.<br>
The novel compounds (I) of the invention, as defined<br>
above, are, as GPCR ligands, m particular GnRH<br>
antagonists, suitable for the treatment of the<br>
pathological states detailed above for administration<br>
to mammals, in particular humans, but also for<br>
veterinary medical purposes, e.g.. in pets and<br>
productive livestock, but also in wild animals.<br>
Administration is possible in a known manner, for<br>
example orally or non-orally, in particular topically,<br>
rectally, intravaginally, nasally or by injection or<br>
implantation. Oral administration is preferred. The<br>
novel compounds (I) of the invention are converted into<br>
a form capable of administration and, where<br>
appropriate, mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or diluents. Suitable excipients and carriers<br>
are described for example in Ullman's Encyclopedia of<br>
Technical Chemistry, Vol. 4 (1953), 1-39; Journal of<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 52 (1963), 918 ff; H. v.<br>

Oral administration can take place for example in solid<br>
form as tablet, capsule, gel capsule, coated tablet,<br>
granulation or powder, but also in the form of a<br>
drinkable solution. For oral administration, the novel<br>
compounds of the invention of the general formula (I),<br>
as defined above, can be combined with known and<br>
conventionally used, physiologically tolerated<br>
excipients and carriers such as, for example, gum<br>
arabic, talc, starch, sugars such as, for example,<br>
mannitol, methylcellulose, lactose, gelatin, surface-<br>
active agents, magnesium stearate, cyclodextrins,<br>
aqueous or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, dispersants,<br>
emulsifiers, lubricants, preservatives and flavors<br>
(e.g. essential oils). The compounds of the invention<br>
can also be dispersed in a microparticulate, e.g. nano-<br>
particulate, composition.<br>
Non-oral administration can take place for example by<br>
intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of<br>
sterile aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions or<br>
emulsions, by means of implants or by ointments, creams<br>
or suppositories. Administration as extended-release<br>
form is also possible where appropriate. Implants may<br>
contain inert materials, e.g. biodegradable polymers or<br>
synthetic silicones such as, for example, silicone<br>
rubber. Intravaginal administration is possible for<br>
example by means of pessaries. Intrauterine<br>
administration is possible for example by means of<br>
diaphragms, etc. In addition, transdermal<br>
administration, in particular by means of a formulation<br>
suitable for this purpose and/or suitable means such<br>
as, for example, patches, is also provided.<br>
As already explained above, the novel compounds (I) of<br>
the invention can also be combined with other active<br><br>
pharmaceutical ingredients. During a combination<br>
therapy, the individual active ingredients can be<br>
administered simultaneously or separately, in<br>
particular either by the same route (e.g. orally) or by<br>
separate routes (e.g. orally and as injection). They<br>
may be present and administered in identical or<br>
different amounts in a unit dose. It is also possible<br>
to apply a particular dosage regimen where this appears<br>
expedient. It is also possible in this way to combine a<br>
plurality of the novel compounds (I) of the invention<br>
together.<br>
The dosage may vary within a wide range depending on<br>
the nature of the indication, the severity of the<br>
disorder, the mode of administration, the age, sex,<br>
body weight and sensitivity of the subject to be<br>
treated. It is within the abilities of a skilled worker<br>
to determine a "pharmacologically effective amount" of<br>
the combined pharmaceutical composition. Unit doses of<br>
from 1 Î¼g to 100 Î¼g, particularly preferably from 1 fig<br>
to 10 mg and most preferably from 1 Î¼g to 1 mg, per kg<br>
of body weight of the subject to be treated are<br>
preferred. Administration can take place in a single<br>
dose or a plurality of separate dosages.<br>
In a further aspect of the present. invention,<br>
accordingly, the present invention also encompasses<br>

Finally, the present invention provides in a last<br>
aspect also a method for the production of the novel<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the invention of the<br>
general formula (I). The method for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of the invention of the general<br>
formula (I) can be carried out in various ways, e.g. in<br>
liquid phase or as partial or complete solid-phase<br>
synthesis. The choice of the suitable synthesis<br>
conditions for preparing individual representatives of<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) can be made by a<br>
skilled worker on the basis of his common general<br>
knowledge. One method of the invention for the<br>
preparation of compounds of the invention of the<br>
general formula (I) is firstly described generally<br>
below. A specific variant of the method, namely a<br>
solid-phase method, is then described. For further<br>
illustration of the present invention, the examples<br>
listed thereafter include numerous representatives of<br>
compounds of the general formula (I).<br>
One method for the preparation of the compounds of the<br>
invention of the general formula (I) is preferably<br><br>
carried out in the following way:<br>
The central tetrahydrocarbazole structure can be<br>
obtained by a Fischer- indole synthesis known per se.<br>
For this purpose, a suitably substituted cyclohexanone<br>
derivative provided where appropriate with protective<br>
groups is condensed with the phenylhydrazine derivative<br>
-which is desired in each case and is likewise suitably<br>
substituted and provided where appropriate with<br>
protective groups, (e.g. as described by Britten &amp;<br>
Lockwood, J.C.S. Perkin I 1974, 1824 or as described by<br>
Maki et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1973, 21, 240). In<br>
particular, the cyclohexanone structure is substituted<br>
in positions 3,3', 5,5' and 6,6' via the radicals Ra to<br>
Rf, and in positions 4,4' via the radicals, or where<br>
appropriate by precursors of the radicals, R6 and R7.<br>
The phenylhydrazine structure is optionally substituted<br>
by the radicals R2 to R5. Phenylhydrazine derivatives<br>
which are not commercially available can be prepared by<br>
methods known to the skilled worker. Positional isomers<br>
which result where appropriate in the condensation of<br>
the cyclohexanone derivative and the phenylhydrazine<br>
derivative can be separated by chromatographic methods<br>
such as, for example, HPLC.<br>
After the synthesis of the central tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
structure, the radical R1 can be introduced by<br>
N-alkylation of the nitrogen atom in position 9 with<br>
appropriate R1halides with use of base (e.g. as<br>
described by Pecca &amp; Albonico, J. Med. Chem. 1977, 20,<br>
487 or else as described by Mooradian et al . , J. Med.<br>
Chem. 1970, 13, 327).<br>
The radicals R6 and R7 can, as already indicated above,<br>
be introduced in various ways depending on their<br>
nature, which is explained in detail below.<br>
a-Aminocarboxylic acid structures in these radicals can<br>
be obtained by treating ketones with NH4(CO)3 and KCN<br><br>
under Schotten-Baumann conditions known per se, and<br>
subsequent alkaline hydrolysis of the hydantoin which<br>
is formed (Britten &amp; Lockwood, J.C.S. Perkin I 1974,<br>
1824) .<br>
Amide residues are preferably generated using methods<br>
known per se from peptide chemistry. For this purpose,<br>
the acid component is activated with an activating<br>
reagent such as DCC or. else HATU (Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
1994, 35, 2279) and condensed in the presence of a base<br>
such as DIPEA and/or DMAP with the amino component.<br>
Ester residues can also be obtained by using the<br>
desired alcohols under analogous conditions. The<br>
solvent used in this case is preferably anhydrous.<br>
Secondary or tertiary amide residues are obtained from<br>
primary amines either by nucleophilic substitution of<br>
alkyl halides or by reductive amination of aldehydes/<br>
ketones (e.g. J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 3849 or Synth.<br>
Conrm. 1994, 609) .<br>
Sulfonamide residues are obtained from the<br>
corresponding amides by reaction with sulfonyl<br>
chlorides.<br>
Urea residues are obtained by reacting the amines with<br>
appropriate isocyanates.<br>
Urethane residues can be prepared by preactivacing the<br>
appropriate alcohols with carbonyldihydroxybenzo-<br>
triazole ((HOBt)2CO) and subsequently reacted with<br>
amines (Warass et al., LIPS 1998, 5, 125).<br>
Alcohols can be obtained from carboxylic es:ers by<br>
reduction with LiAlH4.<br>
Aldehyde residues are obtained from alcohol precursors<br>
by oxidation for example under Swern conditions known<br><br>
per se with DMSO/oxalyl chloride (Pansavath et al..<br>
Synthesis 1998, 436).<br>
Substituted amine residues are obtained by reductive<br>
amination of amines with aldehydes (J. Org. Chem. 1996,<br>
61, 3489).<br>
Ether residues can be obtained by deprotonating the<br>
alcohol precursor with a base such as NaH under<br>
Williams conditions known per se and subsequently<br>
reacting with an alkyl halide.<br>
Double bonds in the radicals can be introduced by<br>
reacting an aldehyde or ketone precursor with<br>
appropriate phosphonylides under Wittig conditions<br>
known per se.<br>
A solid-phase method for the preparation or compounds<br>
of the invention of formula (I) preferably includes<br>
steps (a) to (d) explained in detail below:<br>
Step (a) proceeds essentially in analogy to a Fischer<br>
indole synthesis, e.g. as described by Britten &amp;<br>
Lockwood, J.C.S. Perkin I 1974, 1824; Mak i et. al.,<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1973, 21, 240 or Hutchins &amp; Chapman,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 4869 and comprises the<br>
condensation of a cyclohexanone derivative {'.'.) which<br>
contains the group G and is tethered to a solid<br>
phase SP via a linker L suitable tor f o: :v.: ncj the<br>
radical Rb<br><br><br>
where, in the case where the radical R7 is a hydrogen<br>
atom, a alkyl, a C1 - C12 aralkyl or a hetaryl<br>
radical, the group G is equal to the radical R7, and in<br>
the case where the radical R7 has another one of the<br>
meanings indicated for R7 in formula (I), the group G is<br>
equal to a group -NH-Pg, where Pg is a protective<br>
group, with a phenylhydrazine derivative (III)<br>
substituted by R2 to R5<br><br>
On)<br>
in the presence of an acid, preferably acetic acid, and<br>
of a metal salt, preferably ZnCl2. DMF is preferred as<br>
solvent. The radicals Ra to Rf are defined as indicated<br>
above in formula (I). Certain substituents or groups<br>
may, where appropriate, also be present in protected<br>
form, in which case the protective groups are removed<br>
again by methods known per se at a suitable time during<br>
the synthesis.<br>
Particularly suitable solid phase SP for the purposes<br>
of the present invention are Rink amide-resins (Rink,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 28, 3787), HMB resins (Sheppard<br>
et al. , Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1982, 20, 451),<br>
Wang resins (Lu et al. , J. Org. Chem. 1981, 46, 3433)<br>
or chlorotrityl-resins (Barlos et al . , Int. J. Peptide<br>
Protein Res. 1991, 38, 562), where the cyclohexanone<br>
derivative (II) is to be tethered to the solid phase SP<br>
by means of an (amino) carboxylic acid. Alcohol<br>
precursors of the cyclohexanone derivative (II) can be<br>
tethered by using the DHP linker (Liu &amp; Elman, J. Org.<br><br>
Chem. 1995, 60, 7712). Traceless tethering of aromatic<br>
precursors of the cyclohexanone derivative (II) to<br>
triazine resins is possible (Brase et al. , Angew. Chem.<br>
Int. Ed. 1998, 37, 3413).<br>
The protective group Pg which is included where<br>
appropriate in the group G and protects an a-amino<br>
group -NH2 is preferably a "Fmoc" (9-<br>
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) protective group, but may<br>
also be another customary amino protective group, e.g.<br>
from the series of the alkoxycarbonyl protective groups<br>
(such as, for example the "Z" (benzyloxycarbonyl) or<br>
the "Boc" (tert-butoxycarbonyl) group) or another<br>
suitable protective group, e.g. a "trityl"<br>
(triphenylmethyl) protective group.<br>
The constitution of the linker L is such that<br>
appropriate derivatization (steps (b) and (c)) and<br>
workup (step (d)) result in the desired radical R6 with<br>
one of the meanings indicated above for R6 in the final<br>
product, the tetrahydrocarbazole derivative of the<br>
general formula (I). To illustrate the constitution of<br>
the linker L, this may be explained below by way of<br>
example for the case where R6 equals the group -CONR8R9.<br>
In the case where the radical Rb in the product of the<br>
invention of the formula (I) has the meaning -CONR8R9,<br>
firstly a compound Pg-N(R8) -R9'-COOH forming the linker<br>
L is tethered by means of an activating reagent such as<br>
DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) or HATU (0-(7-<br>
azabenzotriazol-1-yl) -N,N-N' , N' -tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate) to the solid phase SP via free<br>
amino groups of the SP, where Pg and SP have the<br>
meaning indicated above, and R9' forms part of the later<br>
radical R9. The protective group Pg is subsequently<br>
eliminated, e.g. in the case of a Fmoc protective group<br>
by means of piperidine/DMF. This results in a compound<br>
HR8N-R9'-CONH-SP. The latter compound is then in turn<br>
reacted with a precursor of the cyclohexanone<br><br>
derivative (II), namely the cyclohexanone carboxylic<br>
acid (II')<br><br>
using an activating reagent such as DCC or HATU,<br>
finally resulting in the cyclohexanone derivative (II)<br>
as defined above. The meaning of the linker L in the<br>
case just described is -CONR8-R9'-CONH-SP. Any resulting<br>
isomers of whatever type (enantiomers, diastereomers or<br>
positional isomers) can be fractionated - as also<br>
elsewhere during the described preparation process - in<br>
a known manner by means of HPLC.<br>
The actual step (a), i.e. the condensation of the<br>
cyclohexanone derivative (II) with the substituted<br>
phenylhydrazine derivative (III) and, where<br>
appropriate, elimination of the protective group Pg in<br>
the group G by means of, for example, piperidine (in<br>
the case of a Fmoc protective group) then takes place,<br>
so that a free a-amino group is produced again at this<br>
point.<br>
In the case where the radical R7 is bhe group -NHCOR14,<br>
-NHS02R14, -NR12R13 (where R12 and R:3 are not both<br>
hydrogen atoms), -NHCONHR14 or -NHCOOR14, a<br>
derivatization of the now unprotected a-amino group of<br>
the resin-bound cyclohexanone derivative (II) finally<br>
takes place in step (b) , so that the various<br>
alternative radicals R' defined above can be performed.<br><br>
Depending on the nature of the desired radical R7 in the<br>
tetrahydrocarbozole final product (I) of the invention,<br>
the procedure for this is as follows:<br>
In the case where R7 is the group -NHCOR14, the reaction<br>
product from step (a) is reacted with a carboxylic acid<br>
R14COOH in the presence of an activating reagent such<br>
as, for example, DCC or HATU and in the presence of a<br>
base such as, for example, DIPEA (diisopropyl-<br>
ethylamine) or DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine) by known<br>
processes' for forming peptide linkages (cf., for<br>
example, Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35, 22 7 9; alternative<br>
(i))-<br>
In the case where R7 is a sulfonamide group -NHS02R14,<br>
the reaction product from step (a) is reacted with a<br>
sulfonic acid derivative R14So2X, where X is a leaving<br>
group, preferably a halogen atom, in particular a<br>
chlorine atom, in the presence of a base such as, for<br>
example, DMAP or DIPEA (cf., for example, Gennari et<br>
al., EJOC 1998, 2437; alternative (ii)).<br>
In the case where R7 is the group -NR12R13 (where R12 and<br>
R13 are not both hydrogen atoms) , in the case where the<br>
radical R12 is a hydrogen atom, the reaction product<br>
from step (a) is reacted with a reagent R13X, where X is<br>
a leaving group such as, for example, a halide atom, in<br>
particular a chloride atom, in the presence of a base<br>
such as, for example, DBU or DIPEA (cf. Green, JOC<br>
1995, 60, 4287 or JOC 1996, 61, 3849) or with an<br>
aldehyde R13CH0 in the presence of a reducing agent such<br>
as, for example, NaH/B(OAc)3. In the case where neither<br>
of the radicals R12 and R13 is a hydrogen atom, the<br>
reaction product from step (a) is a reacted with a<br>
ketone R12COR13 in the presence of a reducing agent (cf.<br>
Ellmann et al. , JOC 1997, 62, 1240 or Synth. Commun.<br>
1994, 609; alternative (iii)) . In the; case where both<br>
radicals R12 and R13 in R7 equals -NR12R13 are hydrogen<br>
atoms, alternative (vi) below applies.<br><br>
In the case where R7 is the group -NHCONHR14	(a urea<br>
derivative), the reaction product from step	(a) is<br>
reacted with an isocyanate R14NCO (cf. Brown	et al. ,<br>
JACS 1997, 119, 3288; alternative (iv)).<br>
In the case where R7 is a carbamate or urethane group<br>
-NHCOOR14, the reaction product from step (a) is reacted<br>
with an alcohol HOR14 which has been preactivated by<br>
carbonyldihydroxybenzotriazole ((H0Bt)2C0) (cf. Warass<br>
et al., LIPS 1998, 5, 125; alternative (v)).<br>
In the case where R7 is a hydrogen atom, a C1 - C12 alkyl,<br>
C1 - C12 aralkyl, an aryl, a hetaryl radical or the group<br>
-NH2 (i.e. both radicals R12 and R13 in R7 equals -NR12R13<br>
are hydrogen atoms) , step (b) is omitted because no<br>
further derivatization is necessary (alternative (vi)).<br>
Step (c) , i.e. the derivatization on the indole<br>
nitrogen atom, also corresponds, in analogy to step (b)<br>
explained above, to various alternatives which are<br>
explained in detail below:<br>
For cases (i) to (v) defined above in step (b) , a<br>
deprotonation of the reaction product obtained in (b)<br>
takes place by means of a base such as, for example,<br>
NaH or NaHMDS and subsequent derivatization by means of<br>
a group R:X, where X is a leaving group, e.g. a halide<br>
atom, in particular a chloride atom (cf. Collini &amp;<br>
Ellingboe, Tetrahedron Lett. 1997, 38, 7963; Pecca &amp;<br>
Albonico, J. Med. Chem. 1977, 20, 487 or Mooradian et<br>
al., J. Med. Chem. 1970, 13, 327).<br>
For case (vi) defined above in step (b), i.e. when step<br>
(b) is omitted, in analogy to the above description a<br>
deprotonation of the reaction product obtained in (a)<br>
takes place by means of a base such as, for example NaH<br>
or NaHMDS and subsequent derivatization by means of a<br><br>
group R1X, where X is a leaving group, e.g. a halide<br>
atom, in particular a chloride atom.<br>
Step (d) finally substantially includes the elimination<br>
5 of the reaction product obtained in (c) from the solid<br>
phase SP. In the case of Wang, trityl, DHP and Rink<br>
amide resins, elimination of the reaction product<br>
obtained in (c) takes place with the aid of an acid, in<br>
particular with TFA (trifluoroacetic acid). In the case<br>
) of an aminolytic elimination from an HMB resin, the<br>
eliminating reagent used is, for example, ammonia in<br>
methanol. The desired product is then isolated in a<br>
conventional way.<br>
i Exemplary embodiments of the preparation of<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the invention are<br>
detailed below.<br>
Examples<br>
i<br>
I. General synthetic methods for compounds of the<br>
invention<br>
A	Coupling of carboxylic acids to the Rink amide-<br>
resin :<br>
0.1 mmol of Fmoc-protected Rink amide-resin (166 mg,<br>
loading 0.6 mmol/g) are preswollen with 1.5 ml of DMF<br>
in a vessel with bottom frit for 20 min. After<br>
aspiration, 1.5 ml of 20% piperidine/DMF are added and<br>
stirred for 5 min. After aspiration, a further 1.5 ml<br>
of 20% piperidine/DMF are added and stirred for 15 min.<br>
Aspiration is followed by washing four times with DMF.<br>
Then 675 Î¼a.1 of a 0.267 M solution of Fmoc-protected<br>
amino carboxylic acid in DMF, 67 5 ul of HATU solution<br>
(0.267 M in DMF) and 150 ul of NMM solution (2.4 M in<br>
DMF) and 0.01 mmol of DMAP are added and stirred at<br>
40Â°C for 4 h. After aspiration, the same reagents are<br>
again added and stirred at 40Â°C for 4 h. This is<br>
followed by aspiration and washing four times with DMF.<br><br>
B	Coupling of carboxylic acids to the trityl-resin:<br>
2.98 inmol of Fmoc protected aminocarboxylic acid are<br>
dissolved in 3 0 ml of dry dichloromethane, mixed with<br>
14.3 mmol (2.45 ml) of DIPEA and added to 2.98 mmol of<br>
2-chlorotrityl chloride-resin (2 g, loading 1.49 mmol/g<br>
of resin). After shaking for two hours, the resin is<br>
filtered off with suction through a frit and washed<br>
three times with 20 ml of dichloromethane/MeOH/DIPEA<br>
17:2:1. This is followed by washing three times with<br>
20 ml of dichloromethane, three times with methanol and<br>
three times with 2 0 ml of ether and drying in vacuo. A<br>
resin with a loading of 0.5 to 1 mmol of amino<br>
carboxylic acid per g of resin is obtained.<br>
C	Coupling of carboxylic acids to the HMB-resin:<br>
21.3 mmol of amino carboxylic acid and 21.3 mmol of<br>
HATU are dissolved in 60 ml of DMF and mixed with<br>
63.9 mmol (10.9 ml) of DIPEA. After 5 minutes, 5 g of<br>
polystyrene-HMB-resm (loading 0.71 mmol/g of resin)<br>
are added and shaken at RT for 5 minutes. Then<br>
21.3 mmol (2.6 g) of DMAP are added and shaken at RT<br>
for 1 h. The resin is subsequently filtered off with<br>
suction and washed once each with 100 ml of DMF, DCM<br>
and DMF. The resin is mixed with 100 ml of 10% Ac20<br>
(acetic anhydride)/DMF/5% DMAP and shaken for 15 min.<br>
Aspiration is followed by washing three times each with<br>
100 ml of DCM and ether and drying in vacuo.<br>
D	Coupling of carboxylic acids to the Wang resin:<br>
54.6 mmol of carboxylic acid and 27.3 mmol (4.2 ml) of<br>
DIC are dissolved in 500 ml of dry DCM, and stirred at<br>
RT for 10 min. After the precipitated urea has been<br>
filtered off, the solution is evaporated to dryness and<br>
the residue is dissolved in 160 ml of dry DMF. The<br>
solution is added to 4.55 mmol (5 g, loading<br>
0.91 mmol/g of resin) of Wang resin preswollen in DMF,<br>
and 4.55 mmol (556 mg) of DMAP are added. After shaking<br>
at RT for 1.5 hours, the resin is filtered off with<br><br>
suction and taken up in 100 ml of 10% Ac20/DMF/5% DMAP<br>
and shaken for 15 min. Aspiration is followed by-<br>
washing three times each with 100 ml of DCM and ether<br>
and drying in vacuo.<br>
i<br>
E	Coupling of an alcohol to the DHP-resin:<br>
0.5 mmol of DHP-resin (0.5 g, loading density 1 mmol/g)<br>
are preswollen in 2 ml of dichloroethane for 15 min. To<br>
this are added 2 ml of a solution of 0.75 M<br>
i alcohol/0.37 M pyridinium paratoluenesulfonate and<br>
stirred at 80Â°C for 16 h. Cooling to RT is followed by<br>
addition of 5 ml of pyridine, briefly shaking with<br>
inversion and filtration with suction. Washing is<br>
carried out twice each with 5 ml of DMF, DCM and<br>
hexane.<br>

Cell culture:<br>
Alpha T3-1 cells (Bilezikjian et al., Mol. Endocrinol 5<br>
(1991), 347-355) are cultivated in DMEM medium (Gibco-<br>
BRL, Eggenstein-Lepoldshafen, Germany) with penicillin<br>
(100 I.U./ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and glutamine<br>
(0.01 mol/1) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA<br>
Laboratories, Coelbe, Germany) on plastic tissue<br>
culture plates (Nunc, 245 x 245 x 20 mm) . CHO-3 cells<br>
(Schmid et al. , J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000), 9193-9200)<br>
are cultivated under identical conditions apart from<br>
the use of Ham's F12 medium (Gibco-BRL).<br>
10 confluent cell culture plates are washed twice with<br>
50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells are<br>
harvested by scraping off with a rubber policeman into<br>
5 ml of PBS and sedimented by centrifugation at 800 rpm<br>
for 10 min in a laboratory centrifuge (Heraeus) . The<br>
cell pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of 0.25 mol/1<br>
sucrose/0.01 mol/1 triethanolamine, pH 7.4. The cells<br>
are lysed by three cycles of freezing in dry<br>
ice/ethanol bath and thawing at room temperature. The<br>
lysate is centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min, and the<br>
sediment is discarded. The supernatant is centrifuged<br>
at 18 000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 30 min. The<br>
pellet (cell membranes) is suspended in 5 ml of assay<br>
buffer (0.25 mol/1 sucrose, 0.01 mol/1 triethanolamine,<br>
pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin) in a Potter, and stored in<br>
200 ul aliquots at -20Â°C. Protein is determined by the<br>
method of Bradford (Anal. Biochem. 72 (1976), 248-254).<br>
Receptor assay:<br>
Binding studies for competition plots are carried out<br>
as triplicates. A test sample contains 60 fil of cell<br>
membrane suspension (10 ug of protein for aT3-l-cells<br>
or 40 Î¼g of protein for CH03 cells) , 20 Î¼l of 125I<br><br>
labeled Buserelin (100 000 ipm per sample for<br>
competition plots and between 1500 and 200 000 ipm for<br>
saturation experiments) and 20 Î¼l of test buffer or<br>
test compound solution. The test compounds are<br>
dissolved in distilled water or 50% ethanol. Serial<br>
dilutions (5 x 10"6 mol/1 to 5 x 10"12 mol/1) are<br>
prepared in test buffer. The nonspecific binding is<br>
determined in the presence of an excess of an unlabeled<br>
Buserelin (10~6 mol/1) . The test samples are incubated<br>
at room temperature for 30 min. Bound and free ligand<br>
are separated by filtration (Whatman GF/C filter 2.5 cm<br>
diameter) using an Amicon lOx collecting apparatus and<br>
washed twice with 5 ml of 0.02 mol/1 Tris/HCl, pH 7.4.<br>
The filters are moistened with 0.3% polyethyleneimine<br>
(Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 3 0 min in order to<br>
reduce the nonspecific binding. The radioactivity<br>
retained by the filters is determined in a 5-channel<br>
gamma counter (Wallac-LKB 1470 Wizard) .<br>

TETRAHYDROCARBAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS LIGANDS FOR G-<br>
PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORS (GPCR)<br>
The present invention relates to novel tetrahydro-<br>
carbazole derivatives which are ligands of G-protein<br>
coupled receptors, and especially antagonists of<br>
gonadotropin-releasing hormone, to the preparation<br>
thereof, to the use thereof, and to the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions which include these tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
derivatives. The present invention also relates to a<br>
method for treating pathological states mediated by G-<br>
protein coupled receptors in a mammal, in particular a<br>
human.<br>
Technical background<br>
The structural element which is common to all members<br>
of the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) is<br>
the presence of seven transmembrane alpha-helical<br>
segments which are connected together by alternating<br>
intra- and extracellular loops, with the amino terminus<br>
being located on the extracellular side and the carboxy<br>
terminus being located on the intracellular side. The<br>
family of GPCRs can be divided into a plurality of<br>
subfamilies (essentially family A, B and C) with<br>
further sequence homologies within these subfamilies.<br>
Since GPCRs are mainly involved in signal reception and<br>
transduction, a large number of physiological functions<br>
are influenced by them. GPCR ligands are therefore<br>
potentially suitable as medicaments for the therapy and<br>
prophylaxis of a large number of pathological states. A<br>
brief survey of diseases which can be treated with GPCR<br>
ligands is given in S. Wilson et al., Pharmaceutical<br>
News 2000, 7(3) in Table 1.<br>
The majority of known GPCR ligands has a peptide<br>
structure. However, peptide receptor ligands frequently<br>
have some serious disadvantages such as, for example,<br><br>
low bioavailability and metabolic instability. This is<br>
why there has recently been an intensified search for<br>
ligands in the form of small, non-peptide molecules. A<br>
special part is played in the search for novel, non-<br>
peptide receptor ligands by so-called "privileged<br>
structures". These "privileged structures" are the<br>
basic molecular structures which provide ligands for a<br>
large number of different receptors. The term<br>
"privileged structures" was used for the first time by<br>
Evans et al. in connection with benzodiazepine-based<br>
CCK (cholecystokinin) A antagonists from the natural<br>
product asperlicin (B.E. Evans et al., J. Med. Chem.<br>
1988, 31, 2235) . For proteases for example it has been<br>
known for some time that certain structural classes can<br>
serve as inhibitors of various enzymes. Whereas<br>
descriptions in the past were in particular of<br>
mechanism-based inhibitors of various proteases,<br>
however, more recently the frequency of examples of<br>
compounds which, by reason of their three-dimensional<br>
structure, fit well into the active binding region of<br>
various enzymes has increased (cf. M. Whittaker, Cur.<br>
Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998, 2, 386; A.S. Ripka et al.,<br>
ibid., 441). Such "privileged structures" have already<br>
been described for GPCRs too. Examples thereof are,<br>
besides the aforementioned benzodiazepines, also<br>
peptoids, 4-substituted 4-arylpiperidines, but also<br>
specific rigidized p-turn mimetics (B.A. Bunin et al. ,<br>
Ann. Rep. Med. Chem. 1999, 34, 267; R.N. Zuckermann et<br>
al., J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 2678; G.C.B. Harriman,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41, 8853). A review of this is<br>
to be found in A.A. Patchett et al., Ann. Rep. Med.<br>
Chem. 1999, 35, 289. The tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
derivatives of the present invention provide a further<br>
class of "privileged structures" for GPCRs.<br>
Although the present invention provides ligands for<br>
GPCRs in general, the compounds provided by the present<br>
invention are suitable in particular as ligands for a<br>
particular representative of the class of GPCRs, namely<br><br>
gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH can be<br>
assigned to subfamily A of GPCRs (cf. U. Gether et al.,<br>
Endocrine Reviews 2000, 21(1), 90).<br>
GnRH is a hormone which is synthesized predominantly,<br>
but not exclusively, in mammals by nerve cells of the<br>
hypothalamus, is transported via the portal vein into<br>
the pituitary and is delivered in a controlled manner<br>
to the gonadotrophic cells. Interaction of GnRH with<br>
its receptor having seven transmembrane domains<br>
stimulates the production and release of gonadotropic<br>
hormones by means of the second messenger inositol<br>
1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ ions. Luteinizing hormone<br>
(LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which are<br>
gonadotropins released by GnRH, stimulate the<br>
production of sex steroids and gamete maturation in<br>
both sexes. In addition to GnRH (also referred to as<br>
GnRHl), there are two further forms of GnRH, namely<br>
GnRH2 and 3.<br>
The GnRH receptor is used as pharmacological target in<br>
a number of disorders which depend on functioning sex<br>
hormone production, for example prostate cancer,<br>
premenopausal breast cancer, endometriosis and uterine<br>
fibroids. GnRH superagonists or antagonists can be<br>
employed successfully for these disorders. A further<br>
possible indication is, in particular, male fertility<br>
control in combination with a replacement dose of<br>
androgens.<br>
One advantage of GnRH antagonists compared with GnRH<br>
superagonists is their direct activity in blocking<br>
gonadotropin secretion. Superagonists initially bring<br>
about overstimulation of the pituitary, leading to<br>
increased gonadotropin release and sex steroid release.<br>
This hormonal response is terminated only after a<br>
certain delay on the basis of desensitization and<br>
downregulation of GnRH receptor concentrations. It is<br>
therefore possible that GnRH superagonists, both alone<br><br>
and in combination with testosterone, are unable<br>
effectively to suppress sperm production in men and are<br>
thus unsuitable for male fertility control. In contrast<br>
to this, peptide GnRH antagonists, especially in<br>
combination with a replacement dose of androgen, are<br>
able to induce a significant oligozoospermia in humans.<br>
However, peptide GnRH antagonists have a number of<br>
disadvantages. Thus, they have a considerably lower<br>
activity as superagonists and must accordingly be<br>
administered in considerably higher dosages. In<br>
addition, their oral bioavailability is low, so that<br>
they must be administered by injection. Repeated<br>
injections in turn lead to a reduction in compliance.<br>
Furthermore, the synthesis of peptide GnRH antagonists<br>
is complicated and costly by comparison with non-<br>
peptide compounds.<br>
Quinoline derivatives are disclosed as non-peptide GnRH<br>
antagonists for example in WO 97/14682. However, it has<br>
not been possible to date to put any non-peptide GnRH<br>
antagonists on the market.<br>
Technical problem<br>
The problem on which the present invention is based is<br>
to provide novel compounds which are suitable for the<br>
treatment of GPCR-mediated pathological states and<br>
display in particular a GnRH-inhibiting (GnRH-<br>
antagonistic) effect. The novel GPCR ligands,<br>
preferably GnRH antagonists, ought where possible to be<br>
superior to known peptide compounds and represent an<br>
effective alternative or improvement in relation to<br>
known non-peptide compounds. The novel GPCR ligands,<br>
especially GnRH antagonists, should in particular have<br>
high activity and, where possible, a high oral<br>
bioavailability. Their synthesis ought moreover to be<br>
possible simply and at minimal cost. The present<br>
invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions<br><br>
comprising the novel non-peptide GPCR ligands, in<br>
particular GnRH antagonists.<br>
A further problem on which the present invention is<br>
based is to provide novel GPCR ligands, preferably GnRH<br>
antagonists, for use as pharmaceutical remedy and for<br>
use for producing pharmaceutical remedies, comprising<br>
the GPCR ligands, preferably GnRH antagonists.<br>
In addition, it is an object of the present invention<br>
to provide a method for the treatment of GPCR-mediated<br>
pathological states, in particular for inhibiting GnRH,<br>
in a mammal, in particular a human.<br>
All these problems are surprisingly solved by the<br>
provision of the novel tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives,<br>
of the pharmaceutical compositions which comprise these<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives, of the method for<br>
preparing these tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives, and of<br>
the method for the treatment of GPCR-mediated<br>
pathological states, preferably for inhibition of GnRH,<br>
in a mammal, in particular a human, through<br>
administration of the tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives<br>
or the use of the tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives for<br>
producing pharmaceutical remedies for the treatment of<br>
GPCR-mediated pathological states, in particular for<br>
GnRH inhibition.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention provides novel<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the general<br>
formula (I).<br>
In a second aspect, pharmaceutical compositions which<br>
comprise at least one of the novel tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
derivatives of the general formula (I) are provided.<br><br>
In a third aspect, the present invention provides<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the general formula<br>
(I) for use as pharmaceutical remedy.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention relates to<br>
the use of a tetrahydrocarbazole derivative of the<br>
general formula (I) for producing a pharmaceutical<br>
remedy for the treatment of GPCR-mediated pathological<br>
states, in particular for inhibition of GnRH. The<br>
present invention likewise relates to a method for the<br>
treatment of GPCR-mediated pathological states, in<br>
particular for inhibition of GnRH, in a mammal,<br>
preferably a human, where an effective amount of a<br>
compound of the invention of the general formula (I) is<br>
administered to the mammal, preferably the human,<br>
requiring such a treatment.<br>
The present invention additionally provides a method<br>
for preparing tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the<br>
general formula (I). This method comprises for example<br>
the steps of condensation of a cyclohexanone<br>
derivative, which is tethered to a solid phase and is<br>
expediently substituted, with a suitably substituted<br>
phenylhydrazine derivative, a subsequent derivatization<br>
depending on the desired structure of the final<br>
compound, and finally elimination from the solid phase<br>
and isolation of the product.<br>

Reference may also be made at this point to the fact<br>
that, besides the compounds of the general formula (I),<br>
as defined above, which are mentioned per se, the<br>
present invention also encompasses physiologically<br>
tolerated derivatives or analogs, especially also salts<br>
of these compounds.<br><br>
It may further be remarked at this point that: the term<br>
"receptor ligand" or "ligand" is intended for the<br>
purposes of the present invention to designate any<br>
compound which binds in any manner to a receptor (in<br>
i the present invention, the receptor is a GPCR receptor,<br>
preferably a GnRH receptor) and induces either an<br>
activation, inhibition or other conceivable effect on<br>
this receptor. The term "ligand" thus includes<br>
agonists, antagonists, partial agonists/antagonists and<br>
1 other ligands which elicit on the receptor an effect<br>
which resembles the effect of agonists, antagonists or<br>
partial agonists/antagonists. The compounds of the<br>
invention of the general formula (I) are preferably<br>
GnRH antagonists.<br>

i compounds of the general formula (I) in this connection<br>
are those in which the radicals R2, R3, R4 and R5 are<br>
independently of one another methyl, chloro or methoxy<br>
radicals. Very particularly preferred compounds of the<br>
general formula (I) in this connection are those in<br>
i which at least the radical R2 is not a hydrogen atom,<br>

Further representatives of novel compounds of the<br>
invention of the general formula (I), including their<br>
preparation, are indicated in the examples.<br>
The novel tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives (I) of the<br>
invention, as defined above, are ligands of GPCR and<br>
can be employed in particular for the inhibition, i.e.<br>
as antagonists, of gonadotropin-releasing hormone for<br>
example for male fertility control, for hormone<br>
therapy, for the treatment of female sub- or<br>
infertility, for female contraception and for tumor<br>
control.<br>
In male fertility control, the compounds of the<br>
invention bring about a reduction in spermatogenesis.<br>
Combined administration with androgens, e.g.<br>
testosterone or testosterone derivatives such as, for<br>
example, testosterone esters, is preferred. The<br>
testosterone derivatives can in this case be<br>
administered for example by injection, e.g. by intra-<br>
muscular depot injection.<br>
The compounds (I) of the invention can also be employed<br>
where appropriate in combination with other hormones,<br>
e.g. estrogens or/and progestins, in hormone therapy,<br><br>
for example for the treatment of endometriosis, uterine<br>
leiomyomas and uterine fibroids. Combinations of the<br>
GnRH antagonists of the invention and tissue-selective<br>
partial estrogen agonists such as Raloxifen" are<br>
particularly preferred. In addition, the compounds of<br>
the invention can be employed in hormone replacement<br>
therapy. The compounds (I) of the invention can<br>
moreover be employed to increase female fertility, for<br>
example by inducing ovulation, and for the treatment of<br>
sterility.<br>
On the other hand, the novel compounds (I) of the<br>
invention are also suitable for contraception in women.<br>
Thus, the GnRH antagonist of the invention can be<br>
administered on days 1 to 15 of the cycle together with<br>
estrogen, preferably with very small estrogen, dosages.<br>
On days 16 to 21 of the cycle of intake, progestagen is<br>
added to the estrogen/GnRH antagonist combination. The<br>
GnRH antagonist of the invention can be administered<br>
continuously throughout the cycle. It is possible in<br>
this way to reduce the hormone dosages and thus achieve<br>
a reduction in the side effects of nonphysiological<br>
hormone levels. It is additionally possible to achieve<br>
advantageous effects in women suffering from, polycystic<br>
ovary syndrome and androgen-dependent disorders such as<br>
acne, seborrhea and hirsutism. An improved control of<br>
the cycle by comparison with previous administration<br>
methods is also to be expected. Further indications are<br>
benign prostate hyperplasia, gonadal protection during<br>
chemotherapy, controlled ovary stimulation/assisted<br>
reproduction techniques, infantile development<br>
disorders, e.g. precocious puberty and polycystic<br>
ovaries.<br>
Finally, the compounds (I) of the invention, as defined<br>
above, can also be employed for the treatment of<br>
hormone-dependent neoplastic diseases such as<br>
premenopausal cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer<br>
and endometrial cancer, by suppressing endogenous sex<br><br>
steroid hormones.<br>
The novel compounds (I) of the invention, as defined<br>
above, are, as GPCR ligands, in particular GnRH<br>
antagonists, suitable for the treatment of the<br>
pathological states detailed above for administration<br>
to mammals, in particular humans, but also for<br>
veterinary medical purposes, e.g. in pets and<br>
productive livestock,, but also in wild animals.<br>
Administration is possible in a known mariner, for<br>
example orally or non-orally, in particular topically,<br>
rectally, intravaginally, nasally or by injection or<br>
implantation. Oral administration is preferred. The<br>
novel compounds (I) of the invention are converted into<br>
a form capable of administration and, where<br>
appropriate, mixed with pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers or diluents. Suitable excipients and carriers<br>
are described for example in Ullman's Encyclopedia of<br>
Technical Chemistry, Vol. 4 (1953), 1-39; Journal of<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, Vol. 52 (1963), 918 ff; H. v.<br>

Oral administration can take place for example in solid<br>
form as tablet, capsule, gel capsule, coated tablet,<br>
granulation or powder, but also in the form of a<br>
drinkable solution. For oral administration, the novel<br>
compounds of the invention of the general formula (I),<br>
as defined above, can be combined with known and<br>
conventionally used, physiologically tolerated<br>
excipients and carriers such as, for example, gum<br>
arabic, talc, starch, sugars such as, for example,<br>
mannitol, methylcellulose, lactose, gelatin, surface-<br>
active agents, magnesium stearate, cyclodextrins,<br>
aqueous or nonaqueous carriers, diluents, dispersants,<br><br>
emulsifiers, lubricants, preservatives and flavors<br>

can also be dispersed in a microparticulate, e.g. nano-<br>
particulate, composition.<br>
Non-oral administration can take place for example by<br>
intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of<br>
sterile aqueous or oily solutions, suspensions or<br>
emulsions, by means of implants or by ointments, creams<br>
or suppositories. Administration as extended-release<br>
form is also possible where appropriate. Implants may<br>
contain inert materials, e.g. biodegradable polymers or<br>
synthetic silicones such as, for example, silicone<br>
rubber. Intravaginal administration is possible for<br>
example by means of pessaries. Intrauterine<br>
administration is possible for example by means of<br>
diaphragms, etc. In addition, transdermal<br>
administration, in particular by means of a formulation<br>
suitable for this purpose and/or suitable means such<br>
as, for example, patches, is also provided.<br>
As already explained above, the novel compounds (I) of<br>
the invention can also be combined with other active<br>
pharmaceutical ingredients. During a combination<br>
therapy, the individual active ingredients can be<br>
administered simultaneously or separately, in<br>
particular either by the same route (e.g. orally) or by<br>
separate routes (e.g. orally and as injection). They<br>
may be present and administered in identical or<br>
different amounts in a unit dose. It is also possible<br>
to apply a particular dosage regimen where this appears<br>
expedient. It is also possible in this way to combine a<br>
plurality of the novel compounds (I) of the invention<br>
together.<br>
The dosage may vary within a wide range depending on<br>
the nature of the indication, the severity of the<br>
disorder, the mode of administration, the age, sex,<br>
body weight and sensitivity of the subject to be<br><br>
treated. It is within the abilities of a skilled worker<br>
to determine a "pharmacologically effective amount" of<br>
the combined pharmaceutical composition. Unit doses of<br>
from 1 ug to 100 mg, particularly preferably from 1 ug<br>
to 10 mg and most preferably from 1 ug to 1 mg, per kg<br>
of body weight of the subject to be treated are<br>
preferred. Administration can take place in a single<br>
dose or a plurality of separate dosages.<br>
In a further aspect of the present invention,<br>
accordingly, the present invention also encompasses<br>

the invention, as defined above, and where appropriate<br>

The indications already mentioned in connection with<br>
the novel compounds of the invention of the general<br>
formula (I), as defined above (i.e. excluding the<br>
compound disclosed in the publications of Maki et al.<br>
and Millet et al. and mentioned above by name) have<br>
already been given above in relation to the novel<br>
compounds (I) of the invention. The compounds which are<br>
preferred and particularly preferred in the use of the<br>
compounds just defined for producing a pharmaceutical<br>
remedy for inhibiting GnRH are identical to the<br>
preferred and particularly preferred compounds already<br>
mentioned above in connection with the novel compounds<br>
of the invention of the general formula (I), as defined<br>
above.<br>
The present invention provides in a further aspect the<br>
use of a compound (I) of the invention as defined<br>
above, but likewise including the compounds excluded by<br>
name at the outset, for male fertility control or for<br>
female contraception. Preferred and particularly<br>
preferred compounds of the invention for this use are<br>
those compounds already mentioned at the outset as<br>
preferred or particularly preferred compounds of the<br>
invention of general formula (I) as defined above.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a method<br>
for male fertility control or for female contraception,<br>
comprising the administration of an amount, effective<br><br>
for male fertility control or for female contraception,<br>
of a compound of the invention as defined in the<br>
immediately preceding paragraph, to a subject,<br>
preferably a mammal, particularly preferably a human.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to a<br>
method for the treatment of pathological states<br>
mediated by GPCR. The method comprises the<br>
administration of at least one compound (I) of the<br>
invention, as defined above, to a mammal, in particular<br>
a human, when such a treatment is necessary. The<br>
administration normally takes place in a<br>
pharmaceutically effective amount. As already explained<br>
above in relation to the novel compounds (I) of the<br>
invention and the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention, it is the task of the expert knowledge of a<br>
skilled worker to determine a pharmaceutically<br>
effective amount, depending on the specific<br>
requirements of the individual case. However, the<br>
compounds (I) of the invention are preferably<br>
administered in a unit dose of from 1 ug to 100 mg,<br>
particularly preferably from 1 ug to 10 mg and most<br>
preferably from 1 ug to 1 mg per body weight of subject<br>
to be treated. The preferred administration form is<br>
oral administration. The administration of one or more<br>

In addition, the present invention also relates to a<br>
method for inhibiting GnRH in a patient, comprising<br>
administration of a pharmaceutically effective amount<br>
of a compound of the general formula (I), as defined<br>
above, but including compounds excluded by name above,<br>
to a patient requiring such a treatment. The method is<br>
preferably used in male fertility control, hormone<br>
therapy, female contraception, treatment of female sub-<br>
or infertility and tumor control.<br><br>
Finally, the present invention provides in a last<br>
aspect also a method for the production of the novel<br>
tetrahydrocarbazole derivatives of the invention of the<br>
general formula (I) .. The method for the preparation of<br>
the compounds of the invention of the? general<br>
formula (I) can be carried out in various ways, e.g. in<br>
liquid phase or as partial or complete solid-phase<br>
synthesis. The choice of the suitable synthesis<br>
conditions for preparing individual representatives of<br>
compounds of the general formula (I) can be made by a<br>
skilled worker on the basis of his common general<br>
knowledge. One method of the invention for the<br>
preparation of compounds of the invention of the<br>
general formula (I) is firstly described generally<br>
below. A specific variant of the method, namely a<br>
solid-phase method, is then described. For further<br>
illustration of the present invention, the examples<br>
listed thereafter include numerous representatives of<br>
compounds of the general formula (I).<br>
One method for the preparation of the compounds of the<br>
invention of the general formula (I) is preferably<br>
carried out in the following way:<br>
The central tetrahydrocarbazole structure can be<br>
obtained by a Fischer indole synthesis known per se.<br>
For this purpose, a suitably substituted cyclohexanone<br>
derivative provided where appropriate with protective<br>
groups is condensed with the phenylhydrazine derivative<br>
which is desired in each case and is likewise suitably<br>
substituted and provided where appropriate with<br>
protective groups (e.g. as described by Britten &amp;<br>
Lockwood, J.C.S. Perkin I 1974, 1824 or as described by<br>
Maki et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1973, 21, 240). In<br>
particular, the cyclohexanone structure is substituted<br>
in positions 3,3', 5,5' and 6,6' via the radicals Ra to<br>
Rf, and in positions 4,4' via the radicals, or where<br>
appropriate by precursors of the radicals, Rb and R7.<br>
The phenylhydrazine structure is optionally substituted<br><br>
by the radicals R2 10 R5. Phenylhydrazine derivatives<br>
which are not commercially available can be prepared by<br>
methods known to the skilled worker. Positional isomers<br>
which result where appropriate in the condensation of<br>
the cyclohexanone derivative and the phenylhydrazine<br>
derivative can be separated by chromatographic methods<br>
such as, for example, HPLC.<br>
After the synthesis of the central tetrahydrocarbazole<br>
structure, the radical R1 can be introduced by<br>
N-alkylation of the nitrogen atom in position 9 with<br>
appropriate R1-halides with use of base (e.g. as<br>
described by Pecca &amp; Albonico, J. Med. Chem. 1977, 20,<br>
487 or else as described by Mooradian et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem. 1970, 13, 327).<br>
The radicals R6 and R7 can, as already indicated above,<br>
be introduced in various ways depending on their<br>
nature, which is explained in detail below.<br>
a-Aminocarboxylic acid structures in these radicals can<br>
be obtained by treating ketones with NH4 (CO) 3 and KCN<br>
under Schotten-Baumann conditions known per se, and<br>
subsequent alkaline hydrolysis of the hydantoin which<br>
is formed (Britten &amp; Lockwood, J.C.S. Perkin I 1974,<br>
1824) .<br>
Amide residues are preferably generated using methods<br>
known per se from peptide chemistry. For this purpose,<br>
the acid component is activated with an activating<br>
reagent such as DCC or else HATU (Tetrahedron Lett.<br>
1994, 35, 2279) and condensed in the presence of a base<br>
such as DIPEA and/or DMAP with the amino component.<br>
Ester residues can also be obtained by using the<br>
desired alcohols under analogous conditions. The<br>
solvent used in this case is preferably anhydrous.<br>
Secondary or tertiary amide residues are obtained from<br><br>
primary amines either by nucieophiiic substitution of<br>
alkyl halides or by reductive amination of aldehydes/<br>
ketones (e.g. J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61, 3849 or Synth.<br>
Comm. 1994, 609).<br>
Sulfonamide residues are obtained from the<br>
corresponding amides by reaction with sulfonyl<br>
chlorides.<br>
Urea residues are obtained by reacting the amines with<br>
appropriate isocyanates.<br>
Urethane residues can be prepared by preactivating the<br>
appropriate alcohols with carbonyldihydroxybenzo-<br>
triazole ((HOBt)2CO) and subsequently reacted with<br>
amines (Warass et al.., LIPS 1998, 5, 125).<br>
Alcohols can be obtained from carboxylic esters by<br>
reduction with LiAlH4.<br>
Aldehyde residues are obtained from alcohol precursors<br>
by oxidation for example under Swern conditions known<br>
per se with DMSO/oxalyl chloride (Pansavath et al.,<br>
Synthesis 1998, 436).<br>
Substituted amine residues are obtained by reductive<br>
amination of amines with aldehydes (J. Org. Chem. 1996,<br>
61, 3489) .<br>
Ether residues can be obtained	by deprotonating the<br>
alcohol precursor with a base	such as NaH under<br>
Williams conditions known per	se and subsequently<br>
reacting with an alkyl halide.<br>
Double bonds in the radicals can be introduced by<br>
reacting an aldehyde or ketone precursor with<br>
appropriate phosphonylides under Wittig conditions<br>
known per se.<br><br>
A solid-phase method for the preparation of compounds<br>
of the invention of formula (I) preferably includes<br>
steps (a) to (d) explained in detail below:<br>
Step (a) proceeds essentially in analogy to a Fischer<br>
indole synthesis, e.g. as described by Britten &amp;<br>
Lockwood, J.C.S. Perkin I 1974, 1824; Maki et al.,<br>
Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1973, 21, 240 or Hutchins &amp; Chapman,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1996, 37, 4869 and comprises the<br>
condensation of a cyclohexanone derivative (II) which<br>
contains the group G and is tethered to a solid<br>
phase SP via a linker L suitable for forming the<br>
radical R6<br><br>
where, in the case where the radical R7 is a hydrogen<br>
atom, a C1 - C12 alkyl, a C1 - C12 aralkyl or a hetaryl<br>
radical, the group G is equal to the radical R7, and in<br>
the case where the radical R7 has another one of the<br>
meanings indicated for R7 in formula (I), the group G is<br>
equal to a group --NH-Pg, where Pg is a protective<br>
group, with a phenylhydrazine derivative (III)<br>
substituted by R2 to R5<br><br><br>
in the presence of an acid, preferably acetic acid, and<br>
of a metal salt, preferably ZnCl2. DMF is preferred as<br>
solvent. The radicals Ra to Re are defined as indicated<br>
above in formula (I) . Certain substituents or groups<br>
may, where appropriate, also be present in protected<br>
form, in which case the protective groups are removed<br>
again by methods known per se at a suitable time during<br>
the synthesis.<br>
Particularly suitable solid phase SP for the purposes<br>
of the present invention are Rink amide-resins (Rink,<br>
Tetrahedron Lett. 1989, 28, 3787), HMB resins (Sheppard<br>
et al., Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1982, 20, 451),<br>
Wang resins (Lu et al., J. Org. Chem. 1981, 46, 3433)<br>
or chlorotrityl-resins (Barlos et al., Int. J. Peptide<br>
Protein Res. 1991, 38, 562), where the cyclohexanone<br>
derivative (II) is to be tethered to the solid phase SP<br>
by means of an (amino) carboxylic acid. Alcohol<br>
precursors of the cyclohexanone derivative (II) can be<br>
tethered by using the DHP linker (Liu &amp; Elman, J. Org.<br>
Chem. 1995, 60, 7712). Traceless tethering of aromatic<br>
precursors of the cyclohexanone derivative (II) to<br>
triazine resins is possible (Brase et al., Angew. Chem.<br>
Int. Ed. 1998, 37, 3413) .<br>
The protective group Pg which is included where<br>
appropriate in the group G and protects an a-amino<br>
group -NH2 is preferably a "Fmoc" (9-<br>
fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) protective group, but may<br>
also be another customary amino protective group, e.g.<br><br>
from the series of the alkoxycarbonyl protective groups<br>
(such as, for example the "z" (benzyloxycarbonyl) or<br>
the "Boc" (tert-butoxycarbonyl) group) or another<br>
suitable protective group, e.g. a "trityl"<br>
(triphenylmethyl) protective group.<br>
The constitution of the linker L is such that<br>
appropriate derivatization (steps (b) and (c)) and<br>
workup (step (d)) result in the desired radical R6 with<br>
one of the meanings indicated above for R6 in the final<br>
product, the tetrahydrocarbazole derivative of the<br>
general formula (I). To illustrate the constitution of<br>
the linker L, this may be explained below by way of<br>
example for the case where R6 equals the group -CONR8R9.<br>
In the case where the radical R6 in the product of the<br>
invention of the formula (I) has the meaning -CONR8R9,<br>
firstly a compound Pg-N (R8) -R9' -COOH forming the linker<br>
L is tethered by means of an activating reagent such as<br>
DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) or HATU (0-(7-<br>
azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N-N',N'-tetramethyluronium<br>
hexafluorophosphate) to the solid phase SP via free<br>
amino groups of the SP, where Pg and SP have the<br>
meaning indicated above, and R9' forms part of the later<br>
radical R9. The protective group Pg is subsequently<br>
eliminated, e.g. in the case of a Fmoc protective group<br>
by means of piperidine/DMF. This results in a compound<br>
HR8N-R9'-CONH-SP. The latter compound is then in turn<br>
reacted with a precursor of the cyclohexanone<br>
derivative (II), namely the cyclohexanone carboxylic<br>
acid (II')<br><br><br>
using an activating reagent such as DCC or HATU,<br>
finally resulting in the cyclohexanone derivative (II)<br>
as defined above. The meaning of the linker L in the<br>
case just described is -CONR8-R9'-CONH-SP. Any resulting<br>
isomers of whatever type (enantiomers, diastereomers or<br>
positional isomers) can be fractionated - as also<br>
elsewhere during the described preparation process - in<br>
a known manner by means of HPLC.<br>
The actual step (a), i.e. the condensation of the<br>
cyclohexanone derivative (II) with the substituted<br>
phenylhydrazine derivative (III) and, where<br>
appropriate, elimination of the protective group Pg in<br>
the group G by means of, for example, piperidine (in<br>
the case of a Fmoc protective group) then takes place,<br>
so that a free a-amino group is produced again at this<br>
point.<br>
In the case where the radical R7 is the group -NHCOR14,<br>
-NHS02R14, -NR12R13 (where R12 and R13 are not both<br>
hydrogen atoms), -NHCONHR14 or -NHCOOR14, a<br>
derivatization of the now unprotected a-amino group of<br>
the resin-bound cyclohexanone derivative (II) finally<br>
takes place in step (b) , so that the various<br>
alternative radicals R7 defined above can be<br>
performed.<br><br>
Depending on the nature of the desired radical R7 in the<br>
tetrahydrocarbozole final product (I) of the invention,<br>
the procedure for this is as follows:<br>
In the case where R7 is the group -NHCOR14, the reaction<br>
product from step (a) is reacted with a carboxylic acid<br>
R COOH in the presence of an activating reagent such<br>
as, for example, DCC or HATU and in the presence of a<br>
base such as, for example, DIPEA (diisopropyl-<br>
ethylamine) or DMAP (4-dimethylaminopyridine) by known<br>
processes for forming peptide linkages (cf., for<br>
example, Tetrahedron Lett. 1994, 35, 2279; alternative<br>
(i)) â¢<br>
In the case where R' is a sulfonamide group -NHS02R14,<br>
the reaction product from step (a) is reacted with a<br>
sulfonic acid derivative R14S02X, where X is a leaving<br>
group, preferably a halogen atom, in particular a<br>
chlorine atom, in the presence of a base such as, for<br>
example, DMAP or DIPEA (cf., for example, Gennari et<br>
al., EJOC 1998, 2437; alternative (ii)).<br>
In the case where R7 is the group -NR12R13 (where R12 and<br>
R13 are not both hydrogen atoms) , in the case where the<br>
radical R12 is a hydrogen atom, the reaction product<br>
from step (a) is reacted with a reagent R13X, where X is<br>
a leaving group such as, for example, a halide atom, in<br>
particular a chloride atom, in the presence of a base<br>
such as, for example, DBU or DIPEA (cf. Green, JOC<br>
1995, 60, 4287 or JOC 1996, 61, 3849) or with an<br>
aldehyde R13CHO in the presence of a reducing agent such<br>
as, for example, NaH/iB (OAc) 3. In the case where neither<br>
of the radicals R12 and R13 is a hydrogen atom, the<br>
reaction product from step (a) is a reacted with a<br>
ketone R12COR13 in the presence of a reducing agent (cf.<br>
Ellmann et al., JOC 1997, 62, 1240 or Synth. Commun.<br>
1994, 609; alternative (iii) ) . In the case where both<br>
radicals R12 and R13 in R7 equals -NR12R13 are hydrogen<br>
atoms, alternative (vi) below applies.<br><br>
In the case where R' is the group -NHCONHR14 (a urea<br>
derivative) , the reaction product, from step (a) is<br>
reacted with an isocyanate R14NCO (cf. Brown et al.,<br>
JACS 1997, 119, 3288; alternative (iv)).<br>
In the case where R7 is a carbamate or urethane group<br>
-NHCOOR14, the reaction product from step (a) is reacted<br>
with an alcohol HOR14 which has been preactivated by<br>
carbonyldihydroxybenzotriazole ((HOBt)2CO) (cf. Warass<br>
et al., LIPS 1998, 5r 125; alternative (v)).<br>
In the case where R7 is a hydrogen atom, a C1 - C12 alkyl,<br>
C1 - C12 aralkyl, an aryl, a hetaryl radical or the group<br>
-NH2 (i.e. both radicals R12 and R13 in R7 equals -NR12R13<br>
are hydrogen atoms), step (b) is omitted because no<br>
further derivatization is necessary (alternative<br>
(vi)) .<br>
Step (c) , i.e. the derivatization on the indole<br>
nitrogen atom, also corresponds, in analogy to step (b)<br>
explained above, to various alternatives which are<br>
explained in detail below:<br>
For cases (i) to (v) defined above in step (b) , a<br>
deprotonation of the reaction product obtained in (b)<br>
takes place by means of a base such as, for example,<br>
NaH or NaHMDS and subsequent derivatization by means of<br>
a group R1X, where X is a leaving group, e.g. a halide<br>
atom, in particular a chloride atom (cf. Collini &amp;<br>
Ellingboe, Tetrahedron Lett. 1997, 38, 7963; Pecca &amp;<br>
Albonico, J. Med. Chem. 1977, 20, 487 or Mooradian et<br>
al., J. Med. Chem. 1970, 13, 327).<br>
For case (vi) defined above in step (b) , i.e. when step<br>
(b) is omitted, in analogy to the above description a<br>
deprotonation of the reaction product obtained in (a)<br>
takes place by means of a base such as, for example NaH<br>
or NaHMDS and subsequent derivatization by means of a<br><br>
group R1X, where X is a leaving group, e.g. a halide<br>
atom, in particular a chloride atom.<br>
Step (d) finally substantially includes the elimination<br>
of the reaction product obtained in (c) from the solid<br>
phase SP. In the case of Wang, trityl, DHP and Rink<br>
amide resins, elimination of the reaction product<br>
obtained in (c) takes place with the aid of an acid, in<br>
particular with TFA (trifluoroacetic acid). In the case<br>
of an aminolytic elimination from an HMB resin, the<br>
eliminating reagent used is, for example, ammonia in<br>
methanol. The desired product is then isolated in a<br>
conventional way.<br>

III Demonstration of the GnRH-antagonistic effect of<br>
compounds (I) of the invention<br>
Materials:<br>
Buserelin is purchased from Welding (Frankfurt/Main,<br>
Germany) . The compound is labeled with 125I by using the<br>
chloramine T method and Na125I (4000 Ci/mmol; Amersham-<br>
Buchler, Brunswick, Germany). The labeled substance is<br>
purified by reverse phase HPLC on a Spherisorb ODS II<br>
column (250 x 4 mm, particle size 3 Î¼m) by elution with<br>
50% acetonitrile/0.15% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow<br><br>
rate of 0.5 ml/min. The specific activity is<br>
2000 Ci/mmol.<br>
All other chemicals are purchased from commercial<br>
source in the highest available purity.<br>
Cell culture:<br>
Alpha T3-1 cells (Bilezikjian et al., Mol. Endocrinol 5<br>
(1991), 347-355) are cultivated in DMEM medium (Gibco-<br>
BRL, Eggenstein-Lepoldshafen, Germany) with penicillin<br>
(100 I.U./ml), streptomycin (0.1 mg/ml) and glutamine<br>
(0.01 mol/1) and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; PAA<br>
Laboratories, Coelbe, Germany) on plastic tissue<br>
culture plates (Nunc, 245 x 245 x 20 mm) . CHO-3 cells<br>
(Schmid et al. , J. Biol. Chem. 275 (2000), 9193-9200)<br>
are cultivated under identical conditions apart from<br>
the use of Ham's F12 medium (Gibco-BRL).<br>
10 confluent cell culture plates are washed twice with<br>
50 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells are<br>
harvested by scraping off with a rubber policeman into<br>
5 ml of PBS and sedimented by centrifugation at 800 rpm<br>
for 10 min in a laboratory centrifuge (Heraeus) . The<br>
cell pellet is resuspended in 5 ml of 0.25 mol/1<br>
sucrose/0.01 mol/1 triethanolamine, pH 7.4. The cells<br>
are lysed by three cycles of freezing in dry<br>
ice/ethanol bath and thawing at room temperature. The<br>
lysate is centrifuged at 900 rpm for 10 min, and the<br>
sediment is discarded. The supernatant is centrifuged<br>
at 18 000 rpm in a Sorvall SS34 rotor for 30 min. The<br>
pellet (cell membranes) is suspended in 5 ml of assay<br>
buffer (0.25 mol/1 sucrose, 0.01 mol/1 triethanolamine,<br>
pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml ovalbumin) in a Potter, and stored in<br>
200 \xl aliquots at -20CC. Protein is determined by the<br>
method of Bradford (Anal. Biochem. 72 (1976), 248-254).<br>
Receptor assay:<br>
Binding studies for competition plots are carried out<br>
as triplicates. A test sample contains 60 f.il of cell<br><br>
membrane suspension (10 Î¼g of protein for Î±T3-l-cells<br>
or 40 ug of protein for CH03 cells), 20 ul of 125I<br>
labeled Buserelin (100 000 ipm per sample for<br>
competition plots and between 1500 and 200 000 ipm for<br>
saturation experiments) and 20 ul of test buffer or<br>
test compound solution. The test compounds are<br>
dissolved in distilled water or 50% ethanol. Serial<br>
dilutions (5 x 10"6 mol/1 to 5 x 10"12 mol/1) are<br>
prepared in test buffer. The nonspecific binding is<br>
determined in the presence of an excess of an unlabeled<br>
Buserelin (10~6 mol/1). The test samples are incubated<br>
at room temperature for 3 0 min. Bound and free ligand<br>
are separated by filtration (Whatman GF/C filter 2.5 cm<br>
diameter) using an Amicon lOx collecting apparatus and<br>
washed twice with 5 ml of 0.02 mol/1 Tris/HCl, pH 7.4.<br>
The filters are moistened with 0.3% polyethyleneimine<br>
(Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) for 3 0 min in order to<br>
reduce the nonspecific binding. The radioactivity<br>
retained by the filters is determined in a 5-channel<br>
gamma counter (Wallac-LKB 1470 Wizard).<br>
