				<td>SEEDLING REST FOR RICE-PLANING MACHINES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention<br><br>
The present invention relates to a<br><br>
    rice-planting machine for riding, and in particular, to a technology for improving the mobility and the facility of housing of the rice-planting machine by reducing the width of the seedling rest when the rice-planting machine is moved or housed. In particular, the present invention relates to the constitution of a seedling rest in which the seedling rest can be divided at one of the left and right sides thereof and one divisional seedling rest can be mounted or dismounted and after a rice-planting operation is finished, the divisional seedling rest is dismounted and is placed on and engaged with the other fixed seedling rest.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
Conventionally, in a multi-row rice-planting machine capable of planting eight or more rows of rice plants, a technology has been publicly known in which a seedling rest and<br>
a guide rail can be folded; for example, such a technology is<br>
disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 10-<br><br>
127121. The reason of this constitution is as follows: since the multi-row rice-planting machine has a laterally wide seedling rest, it presents a problem that when it is carried or moved, or when it is stored in a warehouse, the seedling rest projecting in the left and right direction from the machine body hinders a worker from operating the rice-planting machine.<br>
In the seedling rest according to this conventional technology, a seedling rest for two rows separably attached to each of the left and right end sides of a center seedling rest for four rows, and each of the two seedling rests on both the left and right end sides are moved to the center while sliding slightly backward and are folded to be placed on the center seedling rest. Also, the left and right guide rails or bumpers are folded upward or forward.<br>
However, since the folding mechanism of the conventional seedling rest is slid (moved in parallel) by a link mechanism, it makes the mechanism complex and increases cost. Also, since the seedling rests on both the left and right end sides are folded on and locked with the seedling rest at the center, operational procedures increases and operations become troublesome. Further, it is necessary to lock and fix the folded seedling rests because they are vibrated or rocked if they are only folded . This increases the number of operations and makes the operations troublesome.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, in a rice-planting machine having a seedling rest which can be contracted in its lateral length, a seedling rest for one row or a plurality of rows serving as a divisional seedling rest is removably attached to one of the left and right sides of the main seedling rest. The divisional seedling rest can be fixedly mounted above the remaining main seedling rest as well. Therefore, the rice-planting machine in accordance with the present invention can be easily moved, carried, or housed.<br>
If the divisional seedling rest has, in particular, two rows, when the divisional seedling rest is mounted above the main seedling rest, the seedling rest can be made smaller in lateral width than a divisional seedling rest for one row. On the other hand, if the number of rows increases more, the weight of the divisional seedling rest increases, but the divisional seedling rest having two rows does not need large force to lift it to facilitate the work of mounting.<br>
Also, since the divisional seedling rest has grips on both left and right sides thereof and one of the left and right grips is arranged at higher position than the other grip, it is easy to dismount the divisional seedling rest and to exert force to dismount it. Further, since the left and right grips are arranged across the center of gravity of the divisional seedling rest, it is easy to keep balance when lifting the divisional<br>
seedling rest and to conduct the work of mounting.<br>
Also, the divisional seedling rest has at least two supported parts in the lateral direction of its reverse surface side and the main seedling rest has, on the seedling supporting surface side thereof, a supporting part for receiving the load in the direction of gravity of the divisional seedling rest which is applied to the supported parts, whereby the divisional seedling rest is supported onto the main seedling rest without swinging in the vertical direction.  Further, the divisional seedling rest has an upper supported part on its reverse surface at a position higher than these supported parts and the main seedling rest has, on the seedling supporting surface thereof, an upper supporting part for supporting the upper supported part to prevent the divisional seedling rest from swinging back and forth and from side to side.  Since the lower supporting structure receives the load in the direction of gravity of the divisional seedling rest, the upper supporting structure may be such a simple and compact constitution that prevents the divisional seedling rest from turning in this way.<br>
Typically, a structure is thought in which the divisional seedling rest has two lower left and right supported parts and one upper supported part on the reverse surface side thereof and the main seedling rest has three corresponding supporting parts so as to support the divisional seedling rest through three points on the seedling supporting surface thereof.<br>
Taking this three-point supporting structure as an example, it is thought as a specific example of a supporting structure of two lower points that the supported parts of the divisional seedling rest are pins projecting substantially downward from the reverse surface thereof and that the main seedling rest is provided with members for engaging with the pins, such as cylindrical members or pipes projecting upward into which the pins are inserted in the axial direction, or the depressed members into which the pins are inserted in the radial direction thereof.<br>
In the case where the supporting parts of the main seedling rest are constituted by the cylindrical members, if the two left and right pins of the divisional seedling rest are different in the depth to which the pins are fitted into the cylindrical members, the two left and right pins can be easily supported by the two left and right cylindrical members of the main seedling rest: that is, the pin to be inserted longer is first inserted into the corresponding cylindrical member so that thereafter the other pin to be inserted to a shorter length is aligned and guided into the corresponding cylindrical member by the first fitted pin and cylindrical member, thereby easily placing and fixing the divisional seedling rest on the main seedling rest.<br>
The above-mentioned and other objects, features, and effects of the present invention will be clear from the<br>
following detailed description based on the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
First, the general constitution of an eight-row rice-planting machine A for riding will be described by the use of Fig. 1. The rice-planting machine A for riding is constituted by a running part 1 and a planting part 4 connected to the rear portion of the running part 1 via a hoisting and lowering link mechanism 27 . The running part 1 is supported by a vehicle body frame 3 and an engine 2 is mounted on the front portion of the vehicle body frame 3 and front wheels 6 are mounted on the bottom of the front portion via a front axle case and rear wheels 8<br>
are mounted on the bottom of the rear portion via a rear axle case 7.<br>
The engine 2 is covered with a hood 9. A pair of provisional seedling rests 10 are respectively arranged on both sides of the hood 9. A steering wheel 14 is arranged above a dashboard 5 at the rear portion of the hood 9.<br>
Both sides of the hood 9 and the top of the vehicle body frame 3 behind the hood 9 are covered with a vehicle body cover 12. The front portion of the vehicle body cover 12 forms a nearly horizontal platform at the same level from both sides of a hood 5 to the rear portion of the dashboard 5 and the rear portion of the vehicle body cover 12 is raised on which a seat 13 is placed.<br>
On the sides of the seat 13 are arranged a running speed change lever 30, an auxiliary speed change lever 31 for hoisting and lowering a seedling planting part and changing a running speed, a lever for adjusting a planting sensitivity, and the like. A main clutch pedal 32 and left and right brake pedals project upwardly above the platform of the top surface of the vehicle body cover 12 behind the dashboard 5 from the bottom of the dashboard 5. A fertilizer supplier 33 for eight rows is mounted on the vehicle body cover 12 at the back of the seat 13.<br>
The above planting part 4 is constituted by seedling rests 16, planting claws 17, center floats 34, side floats 35, and<br>
the like. The seedling rests 16 are inclined forward to direct its seedling supporting surface upward (that is, toward the back of the vehicle body) .  The bottom portion of the seedling rest 16 is supported by a lower guide rail 18 and the upper portion of the bottom surface (that is, the bottom side of the seedling supporting surface and the front side of the vehicle body) is supported by an upper guide rail 19, whereby the seedling rests 16 can be freely reciprocated in the left and right direction, and the lower guide rail 18 and the upper guide rail 19 are supported by a planting center case 20 via a frame and the like. , A plurality of chain cases 21 are projected backward in parallel to each other from the planting center case 20 via a connecting pipe extending in the left and right direction.  On the back of each chain case 21 is arranged a rotary case 22 rotating in one way and on both ends of each rotary case 22 are arranged a pair of planting claws 17.<br>
By moving the constituent members of the planting part 4 in cooperation, the rice-planting machine is moved forward and the seedling rest 16 is reciprocated in the left and right direction, and the planting claws 17 are driven in synchronization with the reciprocating movement of the seedling rest 16 to continuously cut off and plant one bundle of seedlings.<br>
Also, the front portion of the planting center case 20 is coupled to the hoisting and lowering mechanism 27 described<br>
above via a rolling pivot. The hoisting and lowering mechanism<br>
27 is constituted by a top link 25 and lower links 26, and the like and can move the planting part 4 up and down by extending<br>
or contracting a cylinder 28 arranged under the seat 13.<br>
Next, the constitution of the seedling rest 16 in accordance with the present invention will be described.  In the present preferred embodiment, as shown in Fig. 3, the seedling rest 16 is constituted by a divisional seedling rest 16D for planting two rows of seedlings which is arranged on the right side of the machine (right side with respect to the direction in which the rice-planting machine is headed, in the same way in the following) and a main seedling rest 16M for planting six rows of seedlings which is fixed on the left side (left side with respect to the direction in which the rice-planting machine is headed, in the same way in the following) and on the center of the machine . Alternatively, the divisional seedling rest 16D may be attached to the left side of the main seedling rest 16M or the divisional seedling rests 16D may be on both left and right sides of the main seedling rest 16M. As shown in Fig. 2, the divisional seedling rest 16D is detachably attached to the main seedling rest 16M and the detached divisional seedling rest can be placed and received above the seedling supporting surface of the main seedling rest 16M.  Also, the lower guide rail 18, which projects from the right side of the main seedling rest 16M when the divisional<br>
seedling rest 16D is detached, can be turned forward to be received and a side bumper can be slid inward to be received.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, a plurality of ribs 16a are formed on the. seedling supporting surface of the seedling rest 16 in an up and down direction so as to guide a seedling mat placed for each seedling row from both the sides thereof: that is, one rib 16a is arranged on each side of the row and the seedling mat is guided by the ribs 16a arranged on both sides thereof and is carried downward on the inclined seedling supporting surface, and therefore, seven ribs 16a are arranged in total on the main seedling rest 16M from the left end to the right end and three ribs 16a are arranged in total on the divisional seedling rest 16D.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, two seedling-mat-pressing bars 46M each of which is disposed across three rows as a unit are arranged laterally side by side on the seedling supporting surface of the main seedling rest 16M. One seedling-mat-pressing bar 46D is arranged across two rows as a unit on the seedling supporting surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D. Also, a seedling stopper 47 is arranged on each row of the seedling supporting surface of the main seedling rest 16M and the divisional seedling rest 16D (in Fig. 3, the seedling stopper 47 is not shown on each row of the main seedling rest 16M, but it is arranged in reality).<br>
A conventional rice-planting machine for planting eight<br>
rows has five seedling-mat-pressing bars in total; one for each of two collapsible seedling rests, one for two seedling mats at the center of a fixed seedling rest for four rows and one for each seedling mat on both sides thereof.  That is, when a work is finished and remaining seedlings on the seedling rests are taken out, five seedling pressing bars are required to be removed.   In contrast to this, in the present preferred embodiment, as described above, two seedling-mat-pressing bars 46M are mounted on the main seedling rest 16M and one seedling-mat-pressing bars 46D is mounted on the divisional seedling rest 16D. Therefore, this reduces the number of the seedling-mat-pressing bars and can facilitate a work of taking out the remaining seedlings on the seedling rests. And this can reduce the number of parts and the number of man-hours needed to assemble it and reduce cost as well.<br>
The seedling-mat-pressing bar 46 (hereinafter, unless otherwise specified, each of the seedling-mat-pressing bars 46M and 46D is referred to as a seedling mat pressing bar 46) will be described based on from Figs. 3 to 5. Each seedling-mat-pressing bar 46 is constituted by a plurality of longitudinal pressing bars 46a, one lateral supporting bar 46b, and one supporting shaft 46c.<br>
The supporting shaft 46c are arranged in the left and right direction, that is, at right angle to the rib 16a when viewed in rear, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, and are rotatably<br>
supported at both its left and right ends by stopper stays 50 fixed to the ribs 16a.  Describing it in detail, the left end of the supporting shaft 46c of the left seedling-mat-pressing bar 46M on the main seedling rest 16M is rotatably supported by the stopper stay 50 on the left side rib 16a of the first row of seedling mat from the left end (the most left rib 16a of the main seedling rest 16M) and the right end thereof is rotatably supported by the stopper stay 50 on the right side rib 16a of the third row of seedling mat from the left end (the fourth rib 16a from the left end of the main seedling rest 16M) ; the left end of the supporting shaft 46c of the right seedling-mat-pressing bar 46M is rotatably supported by the same stopper stay 50, as described above, on the right side rib 16a of the third row of seedling mat from the left end and the right end thereof is rotatably supported by the stopper stay 50 on the right side rib 16a of the sixth row of seedling mat from the left end (the most right side rib 16a from the left end of the main seedling rest 16M); and each of both left and right ends of the seedling-mat-pressing bar 46D is rotatably supported by each of stopper stays 50 fixed on the ribs 16a of both left and right ends of the divisional seedling rest 16D. In the present preferred embodiment, as described above, the rice-planting machine has five stopper stays 50 in total, three stopper stays 50 being mounted on the main seedling rest 16M and two stopper stays 50 being mounted on the divisional<br>
seedling rest 16D. A conventional rice-planting machine needs<br>
eight stopper stays in total, that is, four stopper stays having<br>
the same function on the fixed seedling rest because three<br>
seedling-mat-pressing bars are arranged on the fixed seedling<br>
rest and two stopper stays on each of left and right collapsible<br>
divisional seedling rests.  The seedling rest according to<br>
present preferred embodiment can reduce the number of stopper<br>
stays and reduce cost as compared with the conventional seedling<br>
rest like this.<br>
Two longitudinal pressing bars 46a are arranged for each row,, that is, between a pair of neighboring ribs 16, as shown in Fig. 3. Each longitudinal pressing bar 46a extends in parallel to each rib 16a when viewed in rear, as shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 and is bent in the shape of an inverted letter V when viewed from the side, as shown in Fig. 5, and its one end extends near to the bottom end of the seedling supporting surface and is inserted into and fixed to an extending pipe 46e fixed to the supporting shaft 46c and its other end is secured to the lateral supporting bar 46b.<br>
The lateral supporting bar 46b is formed in the shape of a letter U when viewed in rear, as shown in Figs . 3 and 4 . Also, as shown in from Figs. 3 to 5, a height adjusting stay 51 is fixed to the top portion of each rib 16a fixing the stopper stay 50 and each of both left and right ends of each lateral supporting bar 46b can be engaged with each height adjusting stay 51.<br><br>
Also, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a supporting pin 46 projects leftward or rightward from the base portion of each longitudinal pressing bar 46a (one from the left longitudinal pressing bar 46a of the two provided for each row projects leftward, and another from the right longitudinal pressing bar 46a projects rightward), and the base portion of the seedling stopper 47 arranged on each row is rotatably supported by the supporting pins 46d projecting from a pair of left and right longitudinal pressing bars 46a.  And the rear surface of the seedling stopper 47 can be engaged with the supporting shaft 46c.  Therefore, the seedling stopper 47 can be turned back and forth about the pair of left and right supporting pins 46d arranged on each row and when the seedling mat is carried to the bottom of the seedling supporting surface in each row, the seedling stopper 47 is turned back to be engaged with the supporting shaft 46c, and when it receives the seedling mat, it is removed from the supporting shaft 46c and is turned forward to put its top end into contact with the seedling supporting surface.<br>
Next, the storing structure of the divisional seedling rest 16D will be described. As shown in Fig. 4, a handle 40R projecting outward is mounted on the right side end of the divisional seedling rest 16D, that is, on the middle of the rib 16a at the side end opposite to the main seedling rest 16M, and a handle 40L projecting backward upward is mounted on the left<br><br>
side end of the divisional seedling rest 16D, that is, on the side end rib 16a mounted on the main seedling rest 16M at a position lower than the handle 40R when viewed in rear.<br>
The handles 40R and 40L, serving as gripping parts when the divisional seedling rest 16D is mounted, dismounted and stored, are arranged separately in the left and right direction across the center of gravity G of the divisional seedling rest 16D, as shown in Fig. 4, at the positions in which a straight line X connecting the portions fixed to the ribs 16a passes near the center of gravity G.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, fitting pins 41L and 41R projecting downward are mounted on the vertical middle portion of the left and right sides of the reverse surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D so as to form two left and right supported parts. The fitting pins 41L and 41R are moved in the axial direction to be inserted into respective supporting pipes 43L and 43R (which will be discussed later) mounted on the main seedling rest 16M for serving as two left and right supporting parts so that the divisional seedling rest 16D placed on the main seedling rest 16M can be fixed at two lower left and right points . In the supporting structure of the lower left and right points, the weight of the divisional seedling rest 16D in the direction of gravity applied to the supported portions of the two lower left and right points of the divisional seedling rest 16D is received by the supporting parts of the two lower left<br>
and right points mounted on the main seedling rest 16M.<br>
Further, a projecting tab 42 having an engaging hole 42a forming a supported part is mounted on the lateral middle portion of the upper guide rail 19 higher than the fitting pins 41L and 41R described above. An engaging pin 44 mounted on the main seedling rest for serving as a supporting part is inserted into the engaging hole 42a of the tab 42 so that the divisional seedling rest 16D mounted on the main seedling rest 16M can be fixed on one upper point. This supporting structure of one point supports the supported part at one upper point of the divisional seedling rest 16D by the supporting part at one upper point of the main seedling rest 16M to prevent the swing of the divisional seedling rest 16D.<br>
In this way, by engaging the three supported parts of one upper point and two lower left and right points formed on the reverse surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D with the three supporting parts of one upper point and two lower left and right points formed on the seedling supporting surface of the main seedling rest 16M, the divisional seedling rest 16D is placed and fixed on the main seedling rest 16M with reliability.<br>
In this connection, supporting structures by the fitting pin 41 and the supporting pipe 43 are arranged at the two lower points on the left and right sides, one for each side, in the present preferred embodiment, but if the divisional seedling<br>
rest 16D is wide in the left and right direction (for example, the divisional seedling rest 16D has three or four rows) , three or more supporting structures may be provided in the left and right direction. The upper supporting structure by the engaging pin 44 and the tab 42 is arranged on one point at the center in the left and right direction, but two or more upper supporting structures may be provided in the left and right direction.<br>
The fitting pin 41L is made different in length from the fitting pin 41R so s to enable the fitting pins 41L and 41R to be inserted in the respective supporting pipes 43L and 43R when the divisional seedling rest 16D is placed and fixed on the main seedling rest 16M. In the preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 6, the right fitting pin 41R is longer than the left fitting pin 41R and therefore the bottom end position of the fitting pin 41R is lower than the bottom end position of the fitting pin 41L.<br>
The mounting structure of mounting the fitting pins 41L and 41R on the reverse surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D will be described by taking the fitting pin 41L as an example . As shown in Figs. 6 and 7, a reinforcing plate 36 is fixed to the reverse surface of the rib 16a, a mounting plate 37 is fixed to the reinforcing plate 36, and the top end of the fitting pin 41L is fixed to the mounting plate 37. The vertically intermediate portion of the reinforcing plate 36 is bent<br>
convexly toward the fitting pin 41L, as shown in Fig. 7, thereby forming a leg portion to make a space between the fitting pin 41L and the reverse surface of the rib 16a.<br>
Each of the fitting pins 41L and 41R is formed at its axially intermediate portion with a collar 41a. The collar 41a defines the depth to which each of the fitting pins 41L and 41R is inserted into the supporting pipe 43 (the supporting pipes 43L and 43R are hereinafter referred to as the supporting pipe 43, unless the left or right side is specified) , and is put into contact with the top end of the supporting pipe 43 when the fitting pin 41 (the fitting pins 41L and 41R are hereinafter referred to as the fitting pin 41, unless the left or right side is specified) is inserted into the supporting pipe 43 to the defined depth. A pin hole 41b into which a fixing pin is inserted is made in the side of the fitting pin 41.<br>
As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, the supporting pipe 43 arranged on the main seedling rest 16M is made by bending a pipe or the like and is arranged so as to project upward with its base portion fixed to a mounting plate 52 fixed to the obverse surface of the rib 16a. Both sides of each mounting plate 52 are bent at the right angle and contact the obverse surface and both sides of the rib 16a. A pair of fixing shafts 52a are fixed to the mounting plate 52 so as to project forward. When the mounting plate 52 is mounted on the rib 16a, the fixing shafts 52a are inserted into mounting holes made in the rib 16a (not shown)<br>
and then a bolt is screwed into each of the fixing shafts 52a from the reverse surface of the main seedling rest 16M to fix the mounting plate 52 to the rib 16a of the main seedling rest 16M.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, the left supporting pipe 43L is fixed to the fourth rib 16a from the left end of the main seedling rest 16M, and the right supporting pipe 43R is fixed to the second rib 16a from the right end of the main seedling rest 16M.  The top end of the left supporting pipe 43L is higher than the top end of the right supporting pipe 43R.  In this connection, a difference in height between the top ends of both the supporting pipes 43L and 43R is smaller than a difference in height between the bottom ends of both the fitting pins 41L and 41R, which are different in length from each other, as described above.  As described below, when the divisional seedling rest 16D is placed and fixed on the main seedling rest 16M, the fitting pin 41R is inserted into the supporting pipe 43R before the fitting pin 41L is inserted into the supporting pipe 43L, thereby serving as a guide when the fitting pin 41L is inserted into the supporting pipe 43L.<br>
The structure of the supporting pipe 43 will be described further in detail. As shown in Figs. 8 and 9, a reinforcing plate 43a is extended along the bottom surface of the inclined portion of the supporting pipe 43 from the rear surface of the mounting plate 52, preferably, in such a way that the section<br>
of the reinforcing plate 43a is directed in the radial direction of the supporting pipe 43 and is fixed to the supporting pipes 43L and 43R by welding or the like to thereby increase the rigidity of the supporting pipe 43. Mounting stays 43L and 43R are fixed to the intermediate portions of the opposite surfaces of both supporting pipes 43b and 43b facing each other, and a connecting bar 49 is laterally interposed between both the mounting stays 43b, as shown in Figs. 3 and 12, to increase the strength of the supporting pipes 43L and 43R in the left and right direction.  (Fig. 12 is a preferred embodiment relating to a supporting pipe 43 other than the supporting pipe 43 shown in Figs. 3, 8 and 9, but the connecting structure of the left and right supporting pipes 43L and 43R by the connecting bar 49 is the same). Also, the left supporting pipe 43L and the stopper stay 50 are fixed on the fourth rib 16a from the left end of the main seedling rest 16M to reduce the number of man-hours needed to mount them.<br>
The top end portion of the supporting pipe 43 is bent to form an inserting portion 43c substantially parallel to the mounting plate 52, that is, the seedling supporting surface of the main seedling rest 16M so that the fitting pip 41 can be easily inserted into the supporting pipe 43. The top end of the inserting portion 43c is shaped like a funnel so that the fitting pipe 41 is easily inserted into the inserting portion 43c. Although both the left and right mounting plates 52 and<br>
both the portions of the left and right supporting pipes 43L and 43R to which the reinforcing plates 43a are fixed'agree with each other in height so as to arrange the connecting bar 49 horizontally, letting the length of the inserting portion 43c of the left supporting pipe 43L be L1 and the length of the inserting portion 43c of the right supporting pipe 43R be L2, a relationship of L1 &gt; L2 is established to make the top end of the supporting pipe 43L higher than the top end of the supporting pipe 43R. A pin hole 43d is made in the side of each inserting portion 43c in such a way that it agrees with the pin hole 41b made in the fitting pin 41 inserted into the inserting portion 43c, and after the fitting pin 41 is inserted into the inserting portion 43c of the supporting pipe 43, a fixing pin is inserted into the pin holes 43d and 41b to fix the fitting pin 41 to the supporting pipe 43.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 6, the tab 42 having the engaging hole 42a is fixed to the center top portion of the reverse surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D, that is, to the lateral middle portion of the upper guide rail 19 described above, and an engaging pin 44 fixed to the main seedling rest 16M is engaged with and fixed by the tab 42. The engaging pin 44 is fixed to the upper portion of the fifth rib 16a from the left end of the main seedling rest 16M in such a way that it can be turned, as shown in Fig. 3. The engaging pin 44 is shaped like a letter L when viewed in side, as shown<br>
in Figs . 10 and 11, and its tip end is so pointed as to be inserted into the engaging hole 42a. Also, as shown by an imaginary line in Fig. 10, the tip end is projected below the tab 42 when the engaging pin 44 is inserted into the engaging hole 42a and a pin hole 44a is made in the side of the projecting portion of the engaging pin 44 and a pin for preventing the engaging pin 44 from coming off is inserted into the pin hole 44a.<br>
Also, the base portion of the engaging pin 44 bent in a circular shape is wound around a pivot 65 so as to rotatably support the engaging pin 44 on the pivot 65. The pivot 65 projects from a supporting plate 66a erected on a mounting plate 66 . The mounting plate 66 is also shaped like the mounting plate 52 and has a pair of fixing shafts 66b to be inserted into holes (not shown) made in the rib 16a, and is fixed to the above-mentioned rib 16a (that is, fifth rib 16a from the left end of the main seedling rest 16M) as is the case where the mounting plate 52 is fixed to the rib 16a.<br>
Up to this point, the constitution of members for placing and fixing the divisional seedling rest 16D removed from the main seedling rest 16M on the main seedling rest 16M has been described, and here, a locking device 45 will be described which connects and locks both the seedling rests 16D and 16M so as to connect the divisional seedling rest 16D to the right end of the main seedling rest 16M, that is, to expand the seedling rest 16 and hold it in the state of planting seedlings.<br>
The locking device 45 is constituted by a pair of sets of locking rods 45a and locking lever 45b arranged on the main seedling rest 16M and a pair of locking cams 45c each of which is  arranged  on  the  divisional  seedling  rest  16D  in correspondence with each locking rod 45a. As shown in Figs. 6, 17 and 18, pipes are arranged laterally in parallel to each other on the lower guide rail 18 and the upper guide rail 19 of the divisional seedling rest 16D respectively, the locking rod 45a is inserted into the pipe, and the locking lever 45b is fixed to the left end of the locking rod 45a, that is, the side end opposite to the side where the divisional seedling rest 16D is attached to the main seedling rest 16M.  The other end of the locking rod 45a projects rightward from the right end of the main seedling rest 16M and is inserted into the locking cam 45c arranged on the divisional seedling rest 16D when the divisional seedling rest 16D is attached to the right side of the main seedling rest 16M. When both the seedling rests 16M and 16D are connected to each other, the locking lever 45b is turned in one way so as to fix the locking rod 45a in the locking cam 45c without coming off.<br>
A method of removing the divisional seedling rest 16D from and fixedly mounting it on the main seedling rest 16M in the constitution described above will be described. First, both the locking levers 45b are turned in the direction opposite to the direction described above to disengage the locking rods 45a<br>
from the locking earns 45c to put the divisional seedling rest 16D into the state where the divisional seedling rest 16D can be removed. Next, the divisional seedling rest 16D is shifted to the right and removed from the main seedling rest 16M by using the handles 40L and 40R and then is moved to the upper portion of the main seedling rest 16M.<br>
Since a difference in length between the fitting pins 41L and 41R is larger than a difference in height between the supporting pipes 43L and 43R, first, the longer fitting pin 41R is inserted into the right lower supporting pipe 43R.  The amount of hoisting the divisional seedling rest 16D is reduced because the supporting pipe 43R is lower than the pipe 43L, which can reduce the labor needed to lift the divisional seedling rest 16D.  Next, the shorter fitting pin 41L is inserted into the left higher supporting pipe 43L .  Here, the divisional seedling rest 16D is required to be slightly lifted so as to position the fitting pin 41L above the higher supporting pipe 43L until the fitting pin 41L is inserted into the supporting pipe 43L after the fitting pin 41R is inserted into the supporting pipe 43R.  However, because the fitting pin 41L is short, the amount of lifting the divisional seedling rest 16D is reduced, and the fitting pin 41R inserted into the supporting pipe 43R is not removed off, and therefore, when the fitting pin 41L of the divisional seedling rest 16D is positioned above the supporting pipe 43L, the supporting pipe 43R serves as a sliding guide when<br>
the divisional seedling rest 16D is lifted and also as the turning fulcrum of the divisional seedling rest 16D to make the fitting pin 41L insert into the supporting pipe 43L easily and smoothly.<br>
When both the fitting pins 41L and 41R are inserted into the supporting pipes 43L and 43R, the positions of the fitting pins 41L and 41R in the supporting pipes 43L and 43R are adjusted until the pin holes 41b agree with the respective pin holes 43d and then a fixing pin is inserted into the pin holes 43d and 41b to prevent the supporting pipes 41L and 41R from coming off. ThuSj the weight of the divisional seedling rest 16D is received by the supporting pipes 43L and 43R in this way.  Then, finally the engaging pin 44 is turned and engaged with the engaging hole 42 made in the front of the divisional seedling rest 16D and a fixing pin is inserted into the pin hole 44a to prevent the engaging pin 44 from coming off.  According to the above-mentioned operations, the divisional seedling rest 16D is supported on the main seedling rest 16M at three points of one upper point and two lower points while being prevented from being turned back and forth and from side to side to support it.<br>
Among the above operations, as described above, because the position of one of the handles 40L and 40R is lowered (the left handle 40L is lower than the right handle 40R) , the fitting pin 41L can be easily inserted into the supporting pipe 43L for<br>
storing the divisional seedling rest 16D, and a force can be easily applied onto the divisional seedling rest 16D while it is lifted and moved. Also, since the handles 40L and 40R are arranged across the center of gravity, when the divisional seedling rest 16D is moved, it can be easily moved without losing its balance.<br>
Next, the other preferred embodiments of a structure for supporting the removed divisional seedling rest 16D onto the main seedling rest 16M will be described.  In the first another preferred embodiment shown in Fig. 12, the fitting pins 41L and 41R are different in length from each other (in the present preferred embodiment, the left fitting pin 41L is longer) to make a difference in height between the bottom end positions of both the fitting pins 41L and 41R, whereas the top end positions of the supporting pipes 43L and 43R are held at the same level (that is, as for the length of the inserting portion 43c shown in Figs. 8 and 9, L1 = L2).  When the divisional seedling rest 16D is removed and placed on the main seedling rest 16M, first, a part of longer fitting pin 41L is inserted into the supporting pipe 43L and then the divisional seedling rest 16D is turned about the fitting pin 41L to position the other fitting pin 41R above the supporting pipe 43R and then the fitting pin 41R is inserted into the supporting pipe 43R. In this case, it is not necessary to take into account the relationship between a difference in height between the top<br>
ends of the supporting pipes 43L and 43R and a difference in height between the bottom ends of the fitting pins 41L and 41R and hence a supporting pipe 43 having the same structure can be used as both the left supporting pipe 43L and the right supporting pipe 43R, which can simplify a manufacturing process,<br>
When viewed from this construction, the preferred embodiment shown in Figs. 3, 8 and 9 in which the top ends of the supporting pipes 43L and 43R are different in height from each other can be regarded as an embodiment in which in order to easily insert a first fitting pin 41 into the supporting pipe 43, the top end of one of the left and right supporting pipes 43L and 43R corresponding to the longer fitting pin 41 (wherein the top ends of the left and right supporting pins 43L and 43R are arranged originally at the same level as shown in FIG. 12) is lower than the other with a height difference within that of length between the left and right fitting pin 41L and 41R.<br>
Next, still another second preferred embodiment of a structure for supporting the divisional seedling rest 16D onto the main seedling rest 16M, which is shown in Figs. 13 and 14, will be described. This preferred embodiment is composed of the supporting structure having two lower left and right supporting points: that is, one point is made by inserting the same pin as described above into a supporting pipe and the other point is made by fitting a pin in a depressed portion.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 13, the fitting pins 41L and 41R have the same length and the top ends of the supporting pipes 43L and 43R are arranged at the same level.  As shown in Fig. 14, one of the left and right supporting pipes 43L and 43R (the right supporting pipe 43R in the present preferred embodiment) is opened at the rear surface of the pipe top portion corresponding to the inserting portion 43c and both sides of the opening is widened to form twin guides 43e so that the fitting pin 41 is easily inserted into the pipe from the opening.  In this way, a depression is formed in a U-like shape opening backward when viewed from the axial direction so as to receive the fitting pin 41. Also, a pin 67 for preventing the fitting pin 41 fitted in the depression from coming off can be inserted through the guides 43e and 43e perpendicularly to the axis of the supporting pipe 43 when viewed from the axial direction.  However, the pin 67 may be inserted into the pin hole 43d and the pin hole 41b, as described above.<br>
In this way, in the present preferred embodiment, the inserting portion 43c of the left supporting pipe 43L has the same pipe structure as is used in the preferred embodiment described above and a portion corresponding to the inserting portion 43c of the right supporting pipe 43R has a depression opened backward. When the divisional seedling rest 16D is removed from and is placed on the main seedling rest 16M, first, a fitting pin 41L is moved in the axial direction and is inserted<br>
into the supporting pipe 43L . When the divisional seedling rest 16D is positioned by using the fitting pin 41L as a fulcrum so that it is in parallel to the main seedling rest 16M in the left and right direction, the fitting pin 41R is guided and inserted between the guides 43e and 43e, and is inserted into the depression of the supporting pipe 43R only by further moving the divisional seedling rest 16D slightly forward, that is, in the radial direction of the fitting pin 41R.  Thereafter, the fitting pin 41R is fixed in the depression of the supporting pipe 43R by the pin 67 for preventing the fitting pin 41R from coming off.  The fitting pins 41L and 41R are fitted in the supporting pipes 43L and 43R in this way to receive the weight of the divisional seedling rest 16D and thereafter the engaging pin 44 is turned and inserted into the engaging hole 42a of the tab 42 so as to be fixed there for preventing the divisional seedling rest 16D from turning.<br>
Next, still another third preferred embodiment of a structure for supporting the divisional seedling rest 16D onto the main seedling rest 16M, which is shown in Figs. 15 and 16, will be described. A pair of left and right rollers 70 whose axes are perpendicular to the reverse surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D are rotatably arranged on the reverse surface of the divisional seedling rest 16D. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 15 , a rail 71 on which the pair of rollers 70 are rotatably arranged extends horizontally rightward from the center of the<br>
main seedling rest 16M, that is, to the side where the divisional seedling rest 16D is attached to the main seedling rest 16M. The right end of the rail 71 is positioned above substantially the right end of the main seedling rest 16M and is rotatably provided with one end of a folding rail 71a.  The folding rail 71a is extended in the direction of the rail 71 when the divisional seedling rest 16D is received on the main seedling rest 16M, and is folded, as shown by imaginary lines in Fig. 15, when seedlings are planted.  In this connection, the main seedling rest 16M and the divisional seedling rest 16D are connected to each other by the same locking device 45 as is described above.<br>
In this constitution, when the width of the seedling rest 16 is contracted, first, the locking device 45 is unlocked and the folding rail Via is turned backward above the divisional seedling rest 16D, thereby being extended. The divisional seedling rest 16D is lifted slightly and the rollers 70 are placed on the rail 71 and are moved above the main seedling rest 16M with the bottom portion of the divisional seedling rest 16D lifted. Since the weight of the divisional seedling rest 16D is applied to the rail 71 via the rollers 70, the divisional seedling rest 16D can be moved easily and lightly, and the divisional seedling rest 16D can be fixedly placed on the main seedling rest 16M by the locking device not shown.<br>
Finally, a wiring structure between the main seedling<br>
rest 16M and the divisional seedling rest 16D will be described. Each of the main seedling rest 16M and the divisional seedling rest 16D is provided with a flasher lamp 54 and seedling feed sensors 55, as shown in Figs. 3, 5 and 18. The flasher lamp 54 and the seedling connecting sensors 55 of the divisional seedling rest 16D are supplied with electric power and control signals from the main seedling rest 16M.<br>
In a seedling rest structure having a conventional folding divisional seedling rest, a structure for supplying electric power to the divisional seedling rest from the main seedling rest uses an expandable curled code or allows a code to have leeway, thereby allowing the divisional seedling rest to be folded. However, when the divisional seedling rest is folded or set in an operation state, the code is apt to be caught on the other parts and might be broken. Also, even if the divisional seedling rest is removed from the main seedling rest for maintenance, the range of motion of the divisional seedling rest is determined by the code.<br>
If the divisional seedling rest is removably structured like the seedling rest 16 of the present invention, the code needs to have more leeway, which further increases the possibility that the code is caught on the other parts or broken. Even if, when the divisional seedling rest is mounted on or dismounted from the main seedling rest, the code is mounted or dismounted as well, the coupling portion of the code needs to<br>
be  waterproof,  which  results  in  producing  troublesome operations of mounting or dismounting the code.<br>
Therefore, in the rice-planting machine of the present preferred embodiment,  as shown in Fig.  17,  socket type connectors 60a and 60b are respectively arranged at the side ends of the divisional seedling rest 16D and the main seedling rest 16M which are opposite to each other, that is, at the joints of both the seedling rests 16D and 16M. A code connected to the flasher lamp 54 and the seedling feed sensors 55 is connected to the connector 60a provided on the divisional seedling rest 16D.   Here, the connectors 60a and 60b are waterproof. According to this constitution, it is possible to dismount the divisional seedling rest 16D only by moving it to the right, and to set it in the operation state and to connect the wiring as well only by moving it to the opposite (left) side .  Therefore , this constitution prevents the code from being caught on the other parts or broken.<br>
Also, as shown in Fig. 18, the locking device 45 serves as a contact as well. That is, a -wiring to be grounded is connected to the main seedling rest 16M and contacts for supplying electric power to two seedling feed sensors 55 for two rows, provided on the divisional seedling rest 16D, are provided on the locking cams 45c. In the divisional seedling rest 16D, two upper and lower locking rods 45a made of metal are used as conductive members for supplying electricity to the<br>
seedling feed sensors 55 as they are (preferably, the surface of the locking rods 45a are covered with non-conductive material), and the seedling feed sensors 55 are connected to the locking rods 45a.  Therefore, when both the locking rods 45a are inserted into the respective locking cams 45c to attach the divisional seedling rest 16D to the main seedling rest 16M, at the same time, the conductive wiring for the two seedling feed sensors 55 of the divisional seedling rest 16D are connected to the conductive wiring to be grounded of the main seedling rest 16M.<br>
 Also, in the preferred embodiment of the seedling rest shown in Fig. 18, the positioning member 56d and 56m used when the divisional seedling rest 16D is attached to the main .seedling rest 16M are respectively mounted on the side ends of the divisional seedling rest 16D and the main seedling rest 16M facing each other. A contact provided on the positioning member 56m of the main seedling rest 16M serves as a contact for supplying electric power to the flash lamp 54 as well and the wiring to be grounded of the flasher lamp 54 is connected to the main seedling rest 16M. According to this constitution, when the divisional seedling rest 16D is attached to and locked with the main seedling rest 16M to bring about the operating state, as described above, the flasher lamp 54 and two seedling feed sensors 55 are brought into conduction. If the divisional seedling rest 16D is not sufficiently locked, the conduction<br>
is not established to turn off the seedling feed sensor 55 of the divisional seedling rest 16D, thereby raising an alarm in the operation panel of the rice-planting machine.<br>
Industrial Availability<br>
