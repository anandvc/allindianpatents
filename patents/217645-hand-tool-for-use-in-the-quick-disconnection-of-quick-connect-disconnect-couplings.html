The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
This invention relates to Hand tool for disconnection of couplings. Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
The present application claims the benefits under 35 U.S.C. 119(e) of provisional patent application serial no. 60/136,050, filed May 26,1999. This application incorporates by reference, as though recited in full, the disclosure of copending provisional application 60/163,050. Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a hand tool, and more particularly, a hand tool for use in the quick disconnect of a quick connect/disconnect coupling.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Quick connect/disconnect couplings are being commonly used to connect pipes and tubing in many areas from automobiles and trucks to gas lines. Although easy to connect, the disconnection requires that the release ring on the connector be recessed simultaneously with the removal of the conduit in the opposite direction. This can be a problem when the connectors are placed in inaccessible areas.<br>
Although many devices have been patented for stripping the ends of electrical wires, such as U.S. 4,951,529, to Andre Laurencot; and U.S.4,475,418 to Isamu Tani none have addressed the issue of removing a quick connector from a conduit.<br>
The disclosed hand tool grasps and moves the conduit in the opposite direction from the release ring on the connector, easily removing the connector from the conduit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A tool is disclosed for the removal of quick release couplings from a conduit. The tool has a body that is divided into a gripping portion a release, portion, with the two portions being rotatably connected. In the manual embodiment, handles are connected to a second end of the body, one to the gripping portion and the second to the release portion. In the preferred embodiment, the second handle is non-movably secured to the release portion. A spring is affixed to the handles to maintain the handles at a maximum separation distance, which maintains the first end of the gripping and release portions adjacent one another. Compressing the handles causes the gripping element to compress and the gripping portion and the release portion to rotate around the connection, creating a distance between the gripping and said release element first ends. In alternative embodiments, the release and gripping portions can be incorporated with an air compressor, activated electrically, or<br><br><br>
through other convenient means. A gripping element is affixed to the gripping portion and has a receiving member and a clamping member. Together the receiving member and clamping member form a conduit retaining area. At least one of the receiving and clamping members are connected to a linkage that goes to the gripping portion handle. The release portion has a release element that has a first and a second plate. In the preferred embodiments, the lower, first plate is stationary, with the second plate movable. In some alternate embodiments, both the first and second plates are stationary. In the preferred embodiments, the second plate has a spring member that retains the second plate adjacent the first plate, thereby enabling a conduit to snap in and being maintained between the first and second plates. The can be a leaf spring placed between the second plate and the release portion or a spring recessed within, or through, the second plate and at least a portion of the release portion.<br>
Preferably the clamping member has at least one arc. and in come embodiments, the receiving member is a mirror image of the clamping member. In the side access embodiments, an optional guide can be used adjacent the clamping member, to prevent the clamping member from moving side to side.<br>
In one embodiment, the clamping member and release element open at the first end of the release and gripping portions to receive the conduit. Preferably the"second plate is rotatably affixed to the release portion and the first plate is stationary to the release portion. The second plate is maintained adjacent to the first plate by a spring. The"clamping member is connected to the linkage and rotates from an open position distanced from the receiving member when said handles are at a maximum distance to adjacent to the receiving member when said handles are compressed.<br>
In another embodiment, the clamping member and release element open at a right angle to the first end of the body portion. Again, the second plate is rotatably affixed to the release portion and the first plate is stationary with the second plate being maintained adjacent to the first plate by a spring. The clamping member is connected to the linkage and moves from an open position distanced from the receiving member when the handles are at a maximum distance to adjacent to the receiving member when said handles are compressed. A guide is stationary to the gripping portion and adjacent to the clamping member to prevent side to side movement of the clamping member.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The disclosed hand tool is used to remove couplings from tubing, piping or other conduits. These quick connect/disconnect couplings are commercially used to connect tubing in all areas of industry, from air to chemicals. The structure, method of operation, and methods of connecting to various conduit materials, is well known in the art. The quick connect/disconnect coupling maintains the two conduits securely, and in fluid, and/or air, tight engagement with one another. The fluid can be a liquid such as water, oil, a combustion fuel such as gasoline, or a gas such as air, natural gas, propane, or the like.  In the manual embodiment, the handle members are hand actuated and through a linkage, such as described in the 4,951,529,4,475,418 and 2,523,936 patents, actuate the gripping and release members.<br><br><br>
The tool can be built on the framework of wire strippers, such as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,951.529, 4,475,418 or 2,523,936, the disclosures of each patent being incorporated herein by reference, as though recited in full.<br>
Although these couplings are made for easy connection and removal, they require space to manipulate the coupling releases. This creates a problem when the couplings need to be replaced within tight spaces, such as on trucks, automobiles, AC units, etc. The disclosed device enables a user to reach into tight spaces, grip the tubing, and separate the coupling with a hand tool.<br>
Figure 1 shows one embodiment of the hand tool of the present invention. The tool 100 includes a pair of handles 102 and 104 that are movable relative to each other, as indicated by the arrow 103. The handles 102 and 104 are biased by the spring 106, maintaining them in the spread a part position during non-use.<br>
The upper section of the tool 100 is divided into a gripping portion 112 and a separating portion 110 that form the upper portion of the frame elements 132 and 130. The frame elements 132 and 130 are maintained in a rotational relationship with one another through the use of a pivot, or hinge, 108, as shown in Figure 2.<br>
The gripping portion 112 includes a pair of gripping jaws; upper jaw 114 and lower jaw 118. In this embodiment, the lower jaw 118 remains stationary, while the upper jaw 114 moves toward the lower jaw 118, in the direction indicated by arrow 115, to grip the tube. The movement of the upper jaw 114 to the lower, or gripping, position is shown in phantom as 116. The movement of the upper jaw 114 must be sufficient to close the spacebetween the jaws 114 and 118 an amount required to securely retain the condu"-; v.ithout creating damage.<br>
The separating portion 110 carries the upper conduit jaw 120 and lower conduit jaws 122. As illustrated in Figure 2, the movement is between the upper jaw 114 and the lower jaw 118, while the two conduit jaws 120 and 122 remain stationary. In the illustrated embodiment, the handle 104 is fixed to the frame elementl30 and remains stationary while the handle 102 moves to pull the upper jaw 114 toward the lower jaw 118, although both handles could move to separate the frame elements 130 and 132. As the handles 102 and 104 are compressed against the resistive force of the compression spring 106, the frame elementsl30 and 132 are separated, moving the gripping portion 112 and separating portion 110 away from one another as indicated by the arrow 111.<br><br><br>
Figure 3 shows the upper gripping jaw 114 spaced from the lower gripping jaw 118 in an open position. The lower gripping jaw 118 can be curved to accommodate the shape of a typical conduit, thereby rendering the system more capable of accommodating a range of conduit diameters. It should be understood that both the upper and lower jaws can be curved or, although less desirable, would be the use of two non-curved surfaces. The lower jaw 118 is fixed in place by a screw 306, or other convenient mechanism, such as a bolt, welding, or the like. Alternatively, the lower jaw can be molded as part of the tool.   It is critical that there be relative movement between the upper and lower gripping jaws, to enable the tool to clamp onto the conduit 400, as shown in Figure 4.   It is not, however, narrowly critical whether one or both jaws move, or whether it is the upper or lower jaw that is movable. The movement of either or both jaws can be achieved in any of the methods well known,in the art.<br>
Figure 3 also illustrates the link member 300 that engages the handle 102 by means of a pm 304. The link member 300, in turn, engages the jaw-supporting member 308, by means of a pin 302. This embodiment illustrates one method of transferring the action created by the squeezing of the handles to the gripping of the jaws and other movement transfer mechanisms can be used. The handle 102 is affixed to the frame element 132 and rear frame 332 by means of a pin or screw 109 and a well knowshaft type of structure, not shown. The frame element 132 and rear frame 332 are each formed from a single piece of metal or other rigid material, and maintained parallel to one another through use of pin 109 or other means known in the art.<br>
Figure 5 shows the handle tool from the opposite side from that illustrated in Figure 3. The upper and lower conduit jaws 120 and 122 need not be moveable, but merely need to be spaced apart a distance sufficient to accommodate the range of diameters of the quick connect coupling. In those instances where the conduit jaws 120 and 122 are not moveable, the handle 104 can be rigidly fixed to the frame elements 130 and 330. A linkage assembly including die link 502 and the pin portion 504 of the linkage element 500 can be used to provide movement of the upper conduit jaw 120 relative to the lower conduit jaw 122.<br>
The use of movable conduit jaws 120 and 122 provides an ability to accommodate a greater range of coupling diameters than is practical with a fixed jaw system. Unlike the pair of jaws 114 and 118, the conduit jaws 120 and 122 do not clamp to a component of the coupling system.   One or both jaws need merely engage a surface of the coupling as will become more evident, hereinafter.<br><br><br>
Figures 6 and 7 correspond to Figures 1 and 2, and illustrate the hand tool 100 used to isconnect a quick connect/disconnect coupling 612 by separating the conduit 600 from the onduit length 614. The quick connect coupling 612 is of any configuration as well know in the art, and in particular is of the design in which the disconnect element 610 must be brought toward the body section of the coupling 612.   When the coupling disconnect element 610 is forced toward and into the coupling body 612, the conduit length 600 is released and is free to separate from the quick disconnect coupling 612.   An edge of the conduit jaw 120 and/or an edge of the conduit jaw 122 is placed to lie adjacent the distal surface of the disconnect element 610.   The clamping of the hand tool 100 onto the conduit length*600 is achieved by squeezing together the handles 102 and 104 and bringing the upper and lower jaws 114 and 118 together. While the tool is clamped to the conduit length 600, the jaws !20 and 122 press against the distal surface of the quick release element 610, forcing the element 610 into the coupling 612.   This movement disengages the conduit 600 from the coupling 612 and forces the coupling 612 to separate from the conduit length 600.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 illustrate an alternative embodiment of the hand tool, indicated generally as 800.   Whereas in the embodiments of Figures 1 through 7, the conduit access is from the side of the hand tool 100, in the embodiment of Figures 8 and 9, the conduit access is from above the hand tool 800. The operation of the tool 800 is essentially the same as that of the hand tool 100. The handles 802 and 804 are squeezed together against the resistive force of the spring thereby causing the frame section 832 and 830 to pivot apart, as indicated by arrow 801, pivoting the conduit jaw 820 away from the clamping jaw 814, The clamping jaw 814 is carried by the upper frame section 812 and the conduit jaw 820 is carried by the upper frame element 810. As noted heretofore, one or both of the clamping jaws 814 or 815 (Figure 14) can move in order to firmly grip the conduit. The conduit jaw 820, as illustrated herein is a V-shape with unmovable legs 822 and 824. The conduit is placed into the V until sufficiently snug to prevent the conduit from slipping. The conduit jaws illustrated in Figures 16 and 17 can also be incorporated into this design. As previously noted, the non-clamping jaw or jaws can be stationary, and the handle 804 can in such case, be fixed relative to the frame element 830.<br>
Figures 10 through 13 show the operation of the jaw components of the hand tool, relative to the conduit and quick disconnect/connect coupling.  The operation is equally representative of the side jaws of Figures 1 and 2 and the top opening jaws of the embodiment of Figures 8 and 9.<br><br>
As seen in Figure 10, the clamping jaws 1000 and 1002 are initially proximate the coupling engaging jaws 1100 and 1102. The conduit length 1050 is brought into position between the clamping jaws 1000 and 1002 and coupling engaging jaws 1100 and 1102. The coupling engaging jaws 1100 and 1102 are positioned proximate, or in contact with, the distal surface 1051 of the quick disconnect element of the coupling 1056. The conduit length 1058 is secured to the coupling body 1056 by means known in the art.<br>
In Figures 11,12 and 13 the pair of jaws 1000 and 1002 are brought into clamping engagement with the conduit 1050 and moved, or pivoted away from the coupling engaging jaws 1100 and 1102. The narrow portion 1054 of the coupling is recessed into the body of the coupling 1056 to release the conduit 1050.   The relative movement of the two pairs of jaws is along the axis of the conduit length 1050 and 1056.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 12, the end 1059 of the conduit length 1050 is withdrawn from within the quick connect/disconnect coupling 1056. In Figure 13, the quick disconnect/connect coupling 1056 and conduit length 1058 fall away from the conduit length 1050.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 illustrate the operation of the top access modification of Figures 8 and 9.   As seen in Figure 14, the conduit length 856 is positioned between the clamping jaws 812 and 815. The coupling engaging jaws 820 and 822 are positioned proximate the quick disconnect element 852 of the coupling 850. The quick connect/disconnect coupling 850 holds the conduit length 854 securely and in fluid tight engagement with the conduit length 856. As illustrated in Figure 15. the two pairs of jaws are moved apart along the axial line of the conduit length 856. The distal edge 823 of the jaw 822 engages the distal surface 851 of the quick release element 852 forcing the quick release element into its disconnect position. The conduit length 856 is thus removed from its position in locked engagement within the quick disconnect/connect coupling 850 and the two conduit lengths 856 and 854 are totally separated from each other.<br>
In Figures 16 and 17 alternate embodiments of the conduit gripping jaw are illustrated. In Figure 16, the jaw unit 700 has three vertically placed conduit receiving areas 702, 704 and 706, having decreasing circumferences. This enables the jaw unit 700 to accommodate several sizes of conduits. It should be noted that this embodiment lends itself to easy removal from the tool for replacement with a jaw unit having different circumferences. Any of the conduit jaws can be removably affixed to the device to enable more diversified use of the tool through the use of jaws have varied sizes and shapes. In<br><br><br>
Figure 17, the size variation is accomplished through use of horizontally placed arcs 722, 724 and 726. Although only the lower jaw 720 is illustrated here, it is preferable, although not critical, that the upper jaw be a complimentary configuration.<br>
In Figure 18 an alternate embodiment is illustrated wherein the support body, divided into two approximate halves, slide in relationship to one another.  The gripping support 752 and conduit support 750 are provided with slide bars 754 and 756 that enable a lateral movement rather than a pivoting action as described heretofore. The conduit support 750 uses an adjustable lower jaw 766 to accommodate the different connector sizes. The lower jaw 766 is connected to an adjustment bar 764 that is, in turn, connected to adjustment pins 758, 760 and 762. As the bar 764 is moved from pin 758 to pin 760, the lower jaw 766 is separate further from the upper jaw 768.<br>
In Figure 19, the gripping body 782 is a substantially smaller unit than the conduit body 780. Rather that being divided into halves, as illustrated in Figure 18, only a portion of the total surface area forms the gripping body 782. The handle 784 is movably supported within the conduit body 780, extending into the gripping body 782 where it is affixed in a manner to enable the sliding action between the two units.  The gripping jaws and conduit jaws are not illustrated in this embodiment and can be of any configuration and/or combination.<br>
In Figures 20 and 21 two handle configurations are illustrated. In Figure 20, the handles 900 are straight handles as illustrated heretofore. In Figure 21, the handles 902 are angled to enable- the user-to reach into tighter spaces. The handles illustrated in these figures are examples only and other configurations, as will be evident to those skilled in the art, can be incorporated with the disclosed device.<br>
In Figures 22 - 25, the hand tool 1000 contains multiple arcs dimensioned to accommodate multiple conduit diameters. For ease of description, the two sides of the hand tool 1000 will be referred to as the conduit gripping portion 1002, illustrated in Figure 22 and the coupling release portion 1020, illustrated in Figure 23. The condmt gripping portion 1002 comprises a pair of multi-arced members, lower member 1004 and upper member 1006. In the illustrated embodiment, each of the members 1004 and 1006 contain mirror image arcs 1008,1010 and 1012 in three different sizes. It should be noted, however, that the number and dimensioning of the arcs is dependent upon the size of the upper member 1004 and lower member 1006 as well as the circumference of the conduits to be accommodated. When in the non-use position the upper member 1005 and the lower member 1004 are separated a distance<br><br><br><br>
slightly greater than diameter of the largest conduit for vhich the unit was dimensioned. The<br>
upper guide 1028 is positioned adjacent the sliding upper member 1006 and servers to<br>
prevent the movable upper member 1006 from wandering or twisting. The guide 1028 is<br>
immovably secured to the frame 1030 and must permit non-binding movement of the upper<br>
member 1006. The use of a guide in this, and other embodiments, is optional and will depend<br>
upon end use and manufacturing decisions. Instances where the guide is beneficial, such as<br>
with larger diameter conduits, etc., will be obvious to those skilled in the art.  In the non-use<br>
position, the coupling release portion 1020, illustrated in Figure 23, the lower release member<br>
1022 is preferably arced in the same manner as the lower member 1006.  The upper release<br>
member 1024, as illustrated, is not arced and it is not necessary to match the arcs on the<br>
bottom release member 1022 for the hand tool 1000 to work, however the upper release<br>
member 1024 can be arced if so desired.<br>
In Figures 24 and 25 the hand tool 1000 is in a second position with the handles having been partially squeezed and the conduit gripped. In the second position the upper member 1006 and the lower member 1004 are brought together to grip the conduit while the upper release member 1024 remains in the original position. Continued pressure on the handles brings the upper release member 1024 into contact with the conduit. It should be noted that the conduit must be able to slide between the upper release member 1024 and the lower release member 1022.  Therefore the construction of the release portion 1020 must be such that the upper release member 1024 is distanced a sufficient amount from the lower release member 1022 to enable movement along the length of the conduit while still contacting the coupling to force release. As the hand tool goes from the second to the third position, as the handles are compressed to their maximum, the release member 1020 pushes against the coupling, as noted heretofore, thereby removing the coupling from the conduit.<br>
Figures 26 through 29 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the hand tool. The hand tool 2500 is designed to grip a conduit when there is little available space on either side of the conduit, as the gripping mechanism is located at the top of the hand tool 2500. Figure 26 illustrates the front view of the tool 2500 in a non-use position.  The release element handle 2559, in this as well as other illustrated embodiments, is preferably secured in a non-movable position relative to the body 2560 to provide a more effective release action as the gripping member handle 2558 and release element handle 2559 are compressed. The gripping member handle 2558 is, again in all embodiments, movable in order to create the clamping action of the gripping members. In the event the clamping and releasing elements described<br><br><br>
in this, and other disclosed embodiments, are incorporated in an air tool, are electrically operated, or receive other methods of activation, the handles would be reconfigured to coordinate the appropriate power source and the clamping and releasing action achieved from the alternate power source. The spring loaded release element 2502 is illustrated in a side view that clearly illustrates how the release element 2502 rotates around the pivot 2504. The spring 2510 in this embodiment is placed within a channel 2512 that has been drilled tlirough the release element 2502, the release plate 2508. The spring 2510 is secured at its ends tlirough use of a bolt, welding, or other methods, or combination of methods. Other methods of providing spring action to the release element 2502 can be used, such as a leaf spring between the release element and the body, springs recessed along the outer surface of the release element, etc. and will be evident to those skilled in the art. The release element 2502 has a receivine arc 2506 to receive the conduit, thereby placing the conduit between the receiving arc 2506 and the release plate 2308. The pressure exerted by the spring 2510 maintains the release element 2502 in the vertical position so that once the conduit is placed within the receiving arc 2506, the release element 2502 is returned as close as possible to its original position with sufficient force that it is able to disconnect the coupling as described heretofore. The pressure applied by the spring 2510 permits a single size arc to remove a variety of coupling sizes, as the coupling release is slightly larger than the diameter of the conduit. The curved top portion of the release element 2502 is beneficial to enable the conduit to easily slide between the release element 2502 and the release plate 2508. Alternatively a release button, or other means, can be used to facilitate the release element 2502 moving away from the release plate 2508 to permit entry of the conduit into the receiving arc 2506.   It should be noted that although the preferred embodiments, as illustrated, show an arc, the release element will also grip the conduit using a flat surface.<br>
Figures 29 and 30 illustrate the conduit gripping head 2550 and the conduit support plate 2552. The conduit gripping head 2550 has a leg 2556 that is contained within the body 2560 of the tool 2500. In the illustrated embodiment, the leg 2556 is prevented from twisting or buckling by being maintained in a channel 2572 (Figure 26). The leg 2556 is prevented from removal from the channel 2572 by a pivot 2566 that enables the conduit gripping head 2550 to rotate. The angle between the gripping head 2550 and the leg 2556 determines the amount of movement of the head 2550 when the handles 2558 and 2559 are compressed. The smaller the angle the shorter the distance between the closed and opened positions. The leg 2556 interacts with the arm 2554 to open and close the gripping head 2550 in response to<br><br><br>
gripping pressure on the handles 2558. The arm 2554 in this embodiment has a pair of flanges 2562 and 2564 that move the leg 2556. Alternative methods, however, such as a rivet, boh, etc, and will be obvious to those skilled in the art.<br>
When the handles 2558 are in the open position, the flanges 2562 and 2564 are in the uppermost position and the head 2550 is pulled back into the conduit receiving position illustrated in Figure 29. Once the handles are squeezed together, the arm 2554 is moved in the direction of arrow A, pulling the flanges 2562 and 2564 in a downward motion and moving the head2550 into contact with the conduit support plate 2552 gripping die conduit between the head 2550 and the support plate 2552. Preferably the contact plate 2552 is slightly curved, however this is not critical to the gripping of the conduit and the plate 2552 can also have a flat surface.<br>
In Figures 30 - 32 a horizontal, spring loaded gripping head design is illustrated in the hand tool 3000. In Figure 30, the conduit lower jaw 3002 and upper jaw 3004 are curved to receive the conduit, and, with the addition of the spring 3006 the upper jaw 3004 and lower jaw 3002 are able to accommodate a variety of conduit sizes using a single arc. The spring 3006 has sufficient force to maintain the upper release member 3004 adjacent the conduit, holding a large range of conduit diameters between the stationary lower release unit 3002 and the spring loaded upper release unit 3004.   Although the multi arced jaws as illustrated heretofore can also be employed, it is not necessary when a spring is incorporated into the hand tool. In this embodiment, the upper release member 3004 is rotated around a pivot point 3008 while the lower release member 3002 remains stationary. As seen in Figure 31, the upper gripping member 3020 interacts with the lower gripping member 3022 to securely hold the conduit while the coupling is removed. This embodiment also employs a"guide 3024 to prevent the upper gripping member 3020 from twisting.   A leaf spring 3006 is illustrated herein, however a similar type spring, or an embedded spring, as illustrated in Figure 33, can also be used to maintain the upper release member 3004 in the closed, or semi closed position.<br>
It should be noted that although several of the embodiments illustrated herein have the lower members stationary, either one, or both, of either the gripping member or releasing elements can move. This is a mater of changing the activation mechanisms and is a modification that will be dependent upon end use and manufacturing costs.<br>
. In Figure 33, the leaf spring 3006 has been replaced with an embedded spring 3254 as described heretofore. The placement of the spring 3256 must be such that it passes between<br><br><br>
the pivot 3258 and the open arc formed by the pivoting upper gripping member 3252 and the stationary lower gripping member 3254.<br>
In the embodiments mat incorporate springs, it should be noted that best results are achieved when the spring is used in conjunction with the coupling release members rather than the conduit gripping members.<br>
In the hand tool 4000 illustrated in Figure 34 the handles have been replaced with a connector/handle 4004 for use with an air generator, electricity or other power source. The size of the body 4002 has been in this embodiment has been reduced, however the sizing will be dependent upon the power source, linkages, etc. The clamping action can be achieved through any method known in the art, such as a motor, and will be obvious to those skilled in the mechanical arts.<br>
Although the foregoing illustrates represent the preferred embodiments, it should be noted that arcs as used in both the release elements and the gripping members are optional. Any of the embodiments can use all arced surfaces, all flat surfaces or a combination thereof. It is preferable that the foregoing gripping members have either.teeth, such as pliers, or some type of non-slide coating that prevents the conduit from slipping. In some instances, it may be beneficial to use both the teeth and a rubber coating and the obvious use of one or the other, or a combination thereof will be obvious to those skilled in the art.<br>
It should be noted that although the description of the action of the hand tool is described as three specific stages, in actual use the motion is smooth and sufficiently rapid to eliminate any separate, specific stages.  The mechanism used to translate the movement of the handles to the gripping head, as illustrated herein, is an example of one method and different mechanical methods of translating the movement of the handles to the movement of the head will be obvious. The novelty lies in the gripping and separating action, rather than how this action is achieved and the motion exchange from handles to air tool will be obvious to those skilled in the mechanical arts.<br><br><br>
