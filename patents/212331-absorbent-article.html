Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, an absorbent article of the present invention will be described in more detail based on preferable embodiments shown in attached drawings. In the specification of the present invention, when the absorbent article is actually worn, a side close to a wearer"s skin is referred to as "upper" side and a side far therefrom is referred to as "lower" side. In addition, when the absorbent article is actually worn, a side corresponding to a front side oÂ£ a body of a wearer is referred to as "front" and a side corresponding to a rear side thereof is referred to as "rear". Note that, in the drawings, members which are actually in contact with each other may be shown to be separately disposed for easy understanding,<br>
FIGs.1 are schematic diagrams each showing an example of an absorbent article of the present invention. FIG. 1(A) is a plan view and FIG. 1(B) is a cross sectional diagram taken along the line 13-13 of FIG. 1(A). Note that, in each plan view/ a front side of an absorbent article and others is shown on an upper side of the diagram. In each plan view, when a front side and a rear side are not symmetrical, the front side and the rear side may be reversed.<br>
An absorbent article 100 of the present invention is basically includes: a leak preventer 10 having a sheet 20, and two bags 30 provided separately on right and left of an upper side of the sheet 20/ each of the two bags having an opening facing with each other; and absorbers 40 having at least one layer and containing a super absorbent polymer and capable of absorbing a body fluid, provided in each of the two bags 30.<br>
As described above, the leak preventer 10 includes the sheet 20 and the two bags 30. Materials generally used for a back sheet can be used as materials for the sheet 20 and the two bags 30. Specific examples of the materials that can be used include: a resin film of PE, PP, PET, EVA, or the like; and a foamed sheet of the resin. The resin film may be used as a composite sheet of the film and a nonwoven fabric for the better touch or appearance. In this case, an SB nonwoven fabric an SMS nonwoven fabric, a thermal bond nonwoven fabric, or the like having a relatively light weight can be suitably used as the nonwoven fabric.<br>
The sheet 20 and the two bags 30 may be constructed integrally or may be bonded- The sheet 20 and the two bags<br>
30 each may be constructed of a plurality of members.<br>
A shape of the sheet 20 is not particularly limited, but 3. preferable aspect thereof is substantially rectangular.<br>
The sheet 20 may be planar as shown in FIGs. 1 or may be folded as shown in FIGs. 6(A) and 6(B).<br>
-4-<br><br>
The two bags 30 are provided separately on right and left of an upper side of the sheet 20 so that apertures thereof face each other. The two bags 30 are preferably symmetrical.<br>
The absorber 40 used in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it absorbs a body fluid. For example, a powdery absorber may be used, but a sheet absorber is preferable in consideration of form stability, releasing of powder, or the like. As described below/ when the &amp; absorbent article of the present invention has a guide sheet, form stability becomes important.<br>
The sheet absorber is preferably a super absorbent sheet containing SAP in 50 wt% or more, preferably 60 to 95 wt%.<br>
The super absorbent sheet is an ultrathin sheet absorber containing SAP as a main component. The super absorbent sheet<br>
has a very high SAP content/ and thus is very thin. The super absorbent sheet has a thickness of preferably 1.5 mm or less,<br>
more preferably 1 mm or less.<br>
A structure or production method of the super absorbent sheet is not particularly limited as long as it is an ultrathin sheet<br>
absorber containing SAP as a main component.<br>
An example of the super absorbent sheet includes a super absorbent sheet obtained through an Air Laid process,<br>
The Air Laid process involves mixing pulverized wood pulp and SAP/ adding a binder/ and forming the mixture into a<br>
sheet/ to thereby obtain a super absorbent sheet. Examples of the super absorbent sheet obtained through the process<br>
include: NOVATH1N available from Reyonier Inc. (U.S.A.); and B-SAP available from OJIKINOCLOTH CO., LTD.<br>
Another example thereof includes a super absorbent sheet obtained through a process involving coating SAP- dispersed slurry on a body fluid permeable sheet such as a nonwoven fabric. The SAP-dispersed slurry is preferably prepared by dispersing SAP and microfibriilated cellulose (MFC) in a mixed solvent of water and ethanol. An example of the super absorbent sheet obtained through this process includes Mega Thin available from Japan Absorbent Technology Institute.<br>
Other examples thereof include: a super absorbent sheet obtained through a process involving carrying a large amount of SAP on a raised-state nonwoven fabric and fixing the SAP with a hot melt binder/ an emulsion binder, an aqueous fiber, or the like; and a super absorbent sheet obtained through a process involving mixing fiber-form SAP with a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) fiber and forming the mixture into a web.<br>
The super absorbent sheet of at least one layer is provided in each of the two bags 30. That is, the super absorbent sheet provided in each of the bags 30 may be one layer or two or more layers.<br>
The super absorbent sheet may also be provided in each of the bags 30 while being folded.<br>
As shown in FIGs. I/ the absorbent article 100 of the present invention is preferably further provided with a guide sheet 50 bringing the absorbers 40 provided in each of the two bags 30.<br>
The guide sheet 50 has a flow path allowing transfer of a body fluid, and quickly transfers urine discharged from a urethral meatus m of a wearer M to a portion between the two bags 30 of the leak preventer 10 (hereinafter, the portion is referred to as "body fluid receiving region") to the absorbers *0. Thus, the wearer does not feel discomfort at the crotch of the body.<br>
The guide sheet 50 preferably allows transfer of a body fluid between the absorbers 40 provided in the respective two bags 30.<br>
When an absorbent article is used, volumes of a body fluid absorbed in absorbers provided in the respective two bags may be significantly unbalanced depending on a posture of a wearer/ a wear position, or the like- In this case, if the absorbent, article of the present invention has a guide sheet, a body fluid transfers from an absorber absorbing a large volume of the body fluid to an absorber absorbing a small volume thereof. As a result, the unbalance is alleviated. Thus/ an actual absorption volume of a body fluid in the absorbent article and a usable life time of the absorbent article are increased.<br>
The guide sheet 50 is not particularly limited as long as the sheet has a structure including a flow path allowing transfer of a body fluid- The guide sheet 50 preferably has neither body fluid absorbency nor body fluid retentivity for allowing quick transfer of the body fluid.<br>
When an absorbent article is used/ the absorbent article is sandwiched between the wearer and underwear or clothes and a pressure is applied thereto. Thus, the guide sheet 50 preferably has pressure resistance. To be specific, s. thickness of the<br>
-5-<br><br>
absorbent article maintained under a pressure of 10 gf/cm2 (9.81 x 102 Pa) is preferably 0.3 mm. or more,, more preferably 0.5 mm or more, and furthermore preferab-y 1.0 mm or more. The guide sheet 50 consisting of two or more laminated layers may be used to satisfy the pressure resistance.<br>
A preferable guide sheet will be described later.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 1, the absorbent article 100 of the present invention is preferably further provided with a skin contact<br>
sheet 60. Being provided with the skin contact sheet GO results in excellent surface touch.<br>
A conventionally known sheet can be used for the skin contact sheet- Specific examples thereof that may be used include: a nonwoven fabric of a synthetic fiber such as a PP nonwoven fabric, a PET nonwoven fabric, a PE nonwoven fabric, or a polyoiefin-polyester nonwoven fabric; and a fabric obtained by blending synthetic fiber and cotton.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 1, the absorbent article 100 of the present invention is preferably further provided with a fitting member<br>
70.<br>
When the wearer is a female, urine easily leaks to a portion other than the body fluid receiving region because of reasons<br>
such as s. slightly protruded urethral meatus and a short perineum. In the present invention, the fitting member can fit the<br>
body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article to a body surface region including the urethral meatus. Thus, urine<br>
quickly transfers to the bags 30 and is absorbed in the absorbers 40. The details of the fitting member will be described<br>
later.<br>
Next, a usage of the absorbent article 100 will be described.<br>
FIGs. 2 are schematic diagrams each explaining a usage of the absorbent article of the present invention, FIG. 2(A; is a partially cutaway cross sectional perspective view showing the absorbent article when worn, and FIG. 2(B) is a cross sectional diagram of the absorbent article.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 2, the absorbent article 100 is worn so that the urethral meatus m of the wearer M is positioned between the two bags 3Q of the leak preventer 10 (body fluid receiving region), and that the bags 30 closely contact with inner groin of both legs L of the wearer M.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 2, the absorbent article 100 is provided with -ehÂ® fitting member 70/ and thus, the fitting member 70 fits the body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article 100 to the body surface region including the urethral meatus m.<br>
Then, the urine discharged from the urethral meatus m of the wearer M passes through the skin contact sheet 60 from the body fluid receiving region by gravity as shown by arrows in FIG. 2 (B). The urine flows along the guide sheet 50 to the bags 30 and is absorbed in the absorbers 40 in the bags 30. When the urine is supplied at a rate exceeding an absorption rate of the absorbers 40, the urine not absorbed in the absorbers 40 is accumulated in the bags 30 once/ and then is absorbed in the absorbers 40 later.<br>
As described above, the absorbent article of the present invention/ when worn/ has the absorbers mainly positioned in portions other than the crotch/ and thus, causes no discomfort which was significant with the conventional absorbent article particularly after the absorber absorbs the body fluid to be swelled.<br>
The absorbent article of the present invention only needs to have a structure covering a periphery of the urethral meatus. Thus, urine and feces may be received separately.<br>
In particular, when the absorbent article of the present invention is provided with the fitting member,, the urine assuredly flows to the bags 30 and is absorbed in the absorbers 40.<br>
Hereinafter, other preferable embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. <leak preventer and others><br>
FIGs. 3 are schematic cross sectional diagrams showing two examples of a leak preventer composed of a composite sheet. FIG. 3(A) shows a first example, and FIG. 3(3) shows a second example,<br>
When the leak preventer is a composite sheet of a film and a nonwoven fabric, the film and the nonwoven fabric may be partially not in contact with each other, or the nonwoven fabric may have an elastic member.<br>
-6-<br><br>
In the first example as shown in FIG. 3(A), a composite sheet of a leak preventer 11 is constructed of a film Ha and a nonwoven fabric lib. In a vicinity of an opening edge portion of each of the bags, the nonwoven fabric lib is folded back from the film Ha to rise. Such rising portion of the nonwoven fabric prevents a leak of the body fluid outward from the rising portion of the nonwoven fabric even when the body fluid "eaks on the film of the opening edge portion of eac'h of the bags from the body fluid receiving region.<br>
In the second example as shown in FIG. 3(B), a composite sheet of a leak preventer 12 is constructed of a film 12a and a nonwoven fabric 12b. In the vicinity of an opening edge portion of each of the bags, the nonwoven fabric 12b is folded back from the film Ha to rise and is rolled to wrap s flexible elastic member (elastic filament/ for example) 12c, to serve as a liquid leak prevention barrier. Thus, when the leak preventer has a liquid leak prevention barrier on an upper surface of the opening of each of the bags/ the discharged body fluid is hardly leaked to a portion other than the body fluid receiving region.<br>
FIGs. 4 are schematic diagrams showing two examples of a leak preventer having pleats with bags. FIG. 4 (A) is a plan view showing a first example, and FIG- 4(3} is a cross sectional diagram of the first example taken along the line IVB-IVB of FIG. 4 (A). FIG, 4(0 is a pisn view showing a second example/ and FIG. 4(D) is a longitudinal sectional diagram of the second example taken along rhe line IVD-IVD of FIG. 4(C). FIG, 4(E) is a cross sectional diagram showing the first example when worn (before absorbing body fluids/ and FIG- 4(F) is a cross sectional diagram showing the first example after absorbing the body fluid.<br>

Examples of a preferable guide sheet include a sheet member having a grooved structurer a concavity-and- convexity-containing sheet member/ and a nonwoven fabric sheet member. The sheet member may be ussd alone, or in combination of two or more thereof.<br>
FIG, 7 is a schematic perspective view showing an example of a sheet member having a grooved structure. A sheet member 80 has a grooved structure 81, and the grooved structure 81 serves as flow paths of a body fluid.<br>
A sheet member having a grooved structure is obtained through a method of providing a grooved structure serving as flow paths on a thermoplastic and body fluid impermeable film by thereoforming.<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic perspective view showing an example of a concavrty-and-convexity-containing sheet member. A concavity-and-convexity-containir-g sheet member 82 shown in FIG. S has many protrusions 83 forming convex portions.<br>
The concavity-and-convexity-containing sheet member has at least one uneven surface having concave portions and convex portions. In the concavity-and-convexity-containing sheet member/ many continuous concave portions serve as flow paths of a body fluid. The concavity-and-convexity-containing sheet member has an advantage in that even when some convex portions are deformed in use, transfer of a body fluid is not inhibited.<br>
An example of a material for the concavity-and- convexity-containing sheet member includes a body fluid impermeable film composed of a resin such as PE, PP, PVA, or uretnane.<br>
In the concavity-and-convexity-containing sheet member, part of or all of the convex portions may be partially or entirely provided with apertures.<br>
FIG. 9 is a schematic perspective view showing an example of a concavity-and-convexity-containing sheet member having all of the convex portions provided with apertures (hereinafter, referred to as "apertured sheet member"). An apertures-provided sheet member 84 shown in FIG. 9 has many protrusions 85 forming convex portions, and the protrusions 85 have<br>
-8-<br><br>
apertures 86 on respective vertices thereof. In the apertures-provided sheet member as shown in FIG. 3, the apertures also serve as flow paths of a body fluid. The apertures-provided sheet member shown in FIG. 9 is preferably used with a surface having larger apertures on a wearer side.<br>
A specific example of the apertures-provided sheet member includes one suggested by the inventors of the present invention in WO 02/065965-<br>
When an apertures-provided sheet member is used as a guide sheet, a body fluid may remain in apertures causing a liquid residue, that is/ a rewetting value may become worse In this case, a hydrophilic diffusion sheet is preferably used in combination under a lower side of the apertures- provided sheet member. Thus, a body fluid present in the apertures permeates and transfers through the hydrophilic diffusion sheet, to thereby drastically decrease a rewetting value. Further/ the apertures-provided sheet member is prevented from shifting from the leak preventer, and its form stability improves as well.<br>
A nonwoven fabric product having a relatively light weight is preferably used as the hydrophilic diffusion sheet. Examples of the hydrophilic nonwoven fabric product include: tissue paper containing rayon, cotton, wood pulp, or the like; and a hydrophilic nonwoven fabric. Specific examples thereof include: tissue paper; a rayon spun bond (TCP, available from Futamura Chemical Co., Ltd., for example); a cotton spun lace/ a rayon/PP mixed spun lace; and rayon/PET mixed spun lace,<br>
Further examples thereof include: a spun bond nonwoven fabric of PP, PE, or PST; a thermal bond nonwoven fabric of PP; and a nonwoven fabric subjected to hydrophilic treatment through surface treatment with a surfactant or the like of a synthetic nonwoven fabric such as a through-air nonwoven fabric of PE/PET.<br>
The apertures-provided sheet member and the hydrophilic diffusion sheet may be laminated through simple superposition or may be combined through hot melting, heat laminating/ or the like.<br>
A body fluid impermeable sheet is preferably used in combination under the hydrophilic diffusion sheet. Thus, the body fluid is not even temporarily accumulated between the hydrophilic diffusion sheet and the sheet of the leak preventer and is quickly transferred to bags of the leak preventer. An example of a material for the body fluid impermeable sheet includes a film made of a resin such as PE, PP, PVA, or polyurethane.<br>
The hydrophilic diffusion sheet and the body fluid impermeable sheet may be laminated through simple superposition or may<br>
be combined through hot melting/ heat laminating/ or the like.<br>
The apertures-provided sheet member and the body fluid impermeable sheet may be used in combination instead of usiny<br>
the hydrophilic diffusion sheet.<br>
The apertures-provided sheet member and the body fluid impermeable sheet may be laminated through simple<br>
superposition or may be combined through hot melting, heat laminating, or the like.<br>
Inner spaces of the nonwoven sheet member serve as flow paths of a body fluid. The nonwoven sheet member preferably has large compressive resistance (so-called resilience). A nonwoven fabric obtained by integrally laminating a paper layer or nonwoven fabric layer having a smooth surface and a thick fibrous web having a bulky and uneven surface, which is proposed by the inventors of the present invention in JP 2003-103704 A and JP 2003-103677 A can be preferably used.<br>

In the absorbent article of the present invention, a body fluid is discharged to a body fluid receiving portion closely-contacting<br>
with a urethral mea.tus of a wearer and is transferred to bags without accumulating therein.<br>
In this case, the absorbent article preferably has a function of receiving a large volume of body fluid in a very short period of time. Usually/ a healthy child discharges 100 ml of urine in about 20 seconds. A healthy adult discharges urine at a rate equal to or higher than the above rate. Thus/ even if 100 mL of urine is discharged in 15 seconds or less, preferably 10 seconds or less, the urine is preferably not accumulated in the body fluid receiving region or not transferred to an outer surface of the absorbent article or the underwear.<br>
Thus, the body fluid receiving region preferably has no pulp or SAP, or at most has a small amount thereof.<br>
In order to facilitate transfer of a body fluid by gravity, the center of a sheet member of a leak preventer is preferably<br>
arranged at a high position so that a body fluid is discharged thereto.<br>
Further, in order to prevent transfer of a body fluid to an outer surface of the absorbent article or underwear, the close contact between a urethral meatus and a body fluid receiving region is preferably increased. To be specific, a member exposed in a body fluid receiving region has a certain thickness/ preferably 0.5 mm or more, more preferably 1.0 mm or more, to thereby exert cushioning properties. A fitting member is preferably used to increase the close contact between the urethral meatus and the body fluid receiving region. Further, such techniques may be combined.<br>
FIG. 12 is a schematic plan view showing anotherexample of the absorbent article of the present invention. In FIG. 12,<br>

A fitting member serves to fit a body fluid receiving region of an absorbent article to a body surface region. A member having elasticity (cushioning properties) or stretchability is preferably used as the fitting member. Examples of the member having elasticity include: a synthetic rubber sheet having a relatively low hardness; an elastic tube; a foamed product (mace of PU, PP. or PP/EVA, for example); and a bulky nonwoven fabric having high resilience. The member having elasticity allows close-contact of the body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article to the body surface region due to its rebound resilience.<br>
Examples of the member having strechability include a stretchabie rubber tape, a. urethane knitted filament, and stretchable urethane foam. The member having stretchability allows close-contact of the body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article to the body surface region by stretching in a front-to-rear direction so that an upward force is applied to a portion where the body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article and the body surface region are in contact with each other.<br>
The following three arrangement aspects of the fitting member can be used: an aspect of arranging a fitting member on an upper side of a sheet of a leak preventer; an aspect of arranging a fitting member under a lower side of a sheet of a leak preventer; and an aspect of arranging fitting members both on upper side and under lower side of a sheet of a leak preventer.<br>
In any aspect, the fitting member may be bonded to a leak preventer and/or a guide sheet. Examples of a bonding method<br>
include a method using an adhesive, a hot-melt adhesive, or a face fastener.<br>
FIGs. 15 are schematic cross sectional diagrams showing various examples of the absorbent article of the present invention.<br>
The absorbent article 100 shown in FIG. 15(A) is the same as the absorbent article 100 shown ir. FIGs. 1. In the absorbent article 100/ i,he .Lifting member 70 is arranged under a lower side of the sheet 20 of the leak preventer 10 An absorbent article 150 shown in FIG. 15(B) is the same as the absorbent article 100 except that a fitting member 71 is arranged above an upper side of the sheet 20 of the leak preventer 10 instead of the fitting member 70 and that the connecting absorber 45 is provided under a lower side of the guide sheet 50. When the fitting member is arranged above an upper side of the sheet of the leak preventer as described above/ the fitting member is preferably body fluid impermeable to allow quick transfer of the body fluid to the bags.<br>
An absorbent article 160 shown in FIG, 15 (C) is the same as the absorbent article 150 except that the fitting member 70 is arranged under a lower side of the sheet 20 of the leak preventer 10- The present invention may employ an aspect in which a leak preventer is provided with a penetration path and a fitting member penetrates the leak preventer therethrough.<br>
A right-to-left width of the fitting member is not particularly limited as long as the fitting member can serve to fit the body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article to the body surface region including a urethral meatus.<br>
A front-to-rear length of the fitting member is not particularly limited as long as the fitting member can serve to fit the body fluid receiving region of the absorbent article to the body surface region including a urethral meatus, Two preferable aspects thereof are; an aspect in which the fitting member has substantially the same front-to-rear length as that of the leak preventer) and an aspect in which the fitting member has a longer front-to-rear length than that of the leak preventer (including an aspect in which the fitting member stretches in use to become longer than the leak preventer).<br>
-12-<br><br>
The aspect in which the fitting member has substantially the same front-to-rear length as that of the leak preventer is<br>
suitably used when the fitting member is a member having elasticity.<br>
Meanwhile, the aspect in which the fitting member has a longer front-fco-rear length than that of the .leak preventer is<br>
suitably used when at least part of the fitting member is a member having streichability (hereinafter/ referred to as<br>
Vretchable fitting member").<br>
When the fronn-to-rear length of the fitting member is longer than the front-to-rear length of the leak preventer/ a ratio or<br>
lengths of portions protruding toward a front side and a rear side of the leak preventer are not oarticularty limited, and are<br>
arbitrarily adjusted depending on the purpose.<br>
The fitting member may include a combination of 2 or more types of members.<br>
For example/ when the front-to-rear length of the fitting member is longer than the front-to-rear length of the leak preventer,, a portion protruding from the leak preventer may be a stretchable fitting member and a portion brought into contact with the leak preventer may be a member having elasticity. The stretchable fitting member and the member having elasticity may be bonded and used.<br>
Further, a member having elasticity may be provided in a portion in contact with the leak preventer/ and a stretchable fitting member may be provided over the entire length of a portion protruding from the leak preventer and a portion in contact with the leak preventer under a lower side or above an upper side of the member having elasticity/ to provide a double-layer structure to the portion in contact with the leak preventer. In this case, as in the absorbent article 160 shown in FIG. 15(C)/ the fitting meir.ber 71 and the fitting member 70 may be provided above an uc^er side and under a lower side of the sheet 20 of the leak preventer 10/ respectively. The fitting member 71 and tho fitting member 70 rAy b% cc'nstr'Jcr'd of a member having elasticity and a stretchable fitting member/ respectively.<br>
When using the fitting member having a longer front-to-rear length than the front-to-rear length of the leak preventer (hereinafter, referred to as "extended fitting member"), preferable aspects to be used are: an aspect in which the absorbent article of the present invention is detachably attached to a cover (underwear/ shorts, and diaper cover/ for example) to be used; and an aspect in which the absorbent article of the present invention is provided with a cover portion/ and fixed to the cover portion to be used (disposable diaper, for example). In any aspect, the fitting member has an effect of preventing the absorbent article from being dislocated greatly by movement of a body of a wearer.<br>

When the fitting member is split and the detachable member is provided in each of the edge portions as in the absorbent<br>
article 171 shown in FIG. 16(B) and the absorbent article 172 shown in FIG. 16 (C)/ a position of the absorbent article when<br>
worn is further stabilized.  Further, when the edge portions on a rear side are branched/ it is easy to prevent the fitting<br>
member from covering the anus/ to further facilitate separate receiving of urine and feces.<br>
The number of split edge portions is not particularly limited.<br>
The use of a plurality of fitting members instead of splitting one fitting member can provide the same -effects as the splitting<br>
even -.-Jhen the number of detachable members is increased.<br><absorbent article set><br>

Next/ a body fluid absorption test was carried out in various postures using the absorbent article of the present invent ion.<br>
The body fluid absorption test was carried out by: attaching the absorbent article on a human body model (manufactured by Hagoromo Mannequin Co., Ltd.) having a hole at a position corresponding to a urethra! meatus; and discharging out a physiological saline from the hole of the human body model in postures of standing/ sitting/ lying face-down, lying on side, and lying on back. The discharge was carried out by 100 mL with 5-minute intervals snd continued until a leak from the absorbent article was observed/ to thereby calculate a total absorption volume until the leak.<br>
The same body fluid absorption test was carried out using a comiercially available incontinence pad (ALifree Anshin Nyoutori Super Strength PadsA, available from Unicharm Corporation) as the conventional absorbent article Table 1 shows the results and design absorption volumes of the respective absorbent artic-es. The design absorption volume refers to a free swelling capacity/ o. retention capacity,, and AUL.<br>
The free swelling capacity was measured through the following procedure. A weight of an absorbent article was measured in advance/ and the absorbent article was immersed in a 0.9 wt% aqueous solution of sodium chloride for 30 minute. Then/ the pad was pulled out and maintained in a pulled-out state for 30 seconds LO drain water therefrom. The pad was placed on a metal rr.esh for draining so "hat the skin contact sheet was positioned to a lower side. An acrylic sheet was placed thereon to apply a load on the entire absorber, and a weight (10 kg) was further placed thereon. The resultant was left to stand for 20 minutes to drain water therefrom. Then/ a weight of the pad was measured, to thereby determine a weight of the pad increased from that before absorption as a free swelling capacity (specific gravity of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride was 1). The measurement was carried out at n - 2.<br>
-15-<br><br>
The retention capacity was measured through the following procedure. The sample used for measuring the free swelling capacity was placed in a dehydration basket of a dehydrator (150 G) so that a side of the skin contact sheet touched a side surface of the dehydration basket, and was dehydrated for 30 seconds. Then, a weight of the sample was measured, to thereby determine a weight of the sample increased from that before absorption as the retention capacity (specific gravity or an aqueous solution of sodium chloride was 1). The measurement was carried out at n - 2.<br>
AUL (Absorption Under Load; was measured through the following procedure. A' weight of a pad was measured in advance/ and the pad was immersed in a 0.9'wt% aqueous solution of sodium chloride for 10 minutes with a weight placed thereon to apply a load of 20 gf/m2 (1.96 x 103 Pa) on the pad. Then, the pad was pulled out with the weight placed thereon and maintained in a pulled-out state for 60 seconds to drain water therefrom. Then, a weight of the pad was measured/ to thereby determine a weight of the pad increased from that before absorption as AUL (specific gravity of an aqueous solution of sodium chloride was 1). The measurement was. carried out at n = 2.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
	Design absorption volume (mL)	Absorption volume by posture (mL)<br>
