				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
	This invention relates to a method of filtering messages received by a<br>
	telecommunications device such as a mobile phone, and in particular to a method of<br>
5	filtering the content of text messages to remove or modify text that may be offensive to<br>
	the use of the device.<br>
	An increasingly important feature of modem mobile phones is the ability to send SMS<br>
	messages (text messages). Mobile text messaging has become very popular,<br>
10	particularly for the young. Usually, the receiver of a text message knows the sender of<br>
	that message, but many messages are unsolicited, for the purposes of, for example,<br>
	advertising. There is a growing concern that the content of some messages, either<br>
	solicited or unsolicited, may cause offence to the recipient, and it is impossible for the<br>
	recipient to know whether a message is likely to cause offence without displaying and<br>
15	reading it.<br>
	Mobile network operators have some responsibility to prevent such messages being<br>
	delivered, and are investing in server technology to filter text messages, so that they<br>
	don't end up on users' mobile phones. However, because the number of messages<br>
20	being past through each network is very large, it requires powerful machines to process<br>
	all of them reliably. One way in which a mobile network operator can filter text<br>
	messages is to apply a generic set of rules for the filtering of likely offensive material<br>
	(such as profanity, racism etc). These rules do, however, tend to be general), as they<br>
	must relate to material which is likely to be deemed offensive by the majority of users.<br>
25<br>
	The aim of the invention is to provide a method of filtering messages to remove<br>
	offensive material in such a way that a recipient can tailor the filtering rules so as to<br>
	remove or modify the content of received messages that is offensive to that user,<br>
30	The present invention provides a method of filtering messages received by a<br>
	telecommunications device, the method comprising the steps of: -<br><br>
2<br>
		a)	inputting a rule set into the telecommunications device;<br>
		b)	reading an incoming message;<br>
		c)	modifying the message if that message breaks a rule of the rule set; and<br>
		d)	displaying the modified message;<br>
5			wherein the rule set comprises a plurality of rules, each of which relates<br>
	to a respective predetermined message content.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, the message is a text message. In this case, step b) may<br>
	include the step of parsing the incoming test message, and step c) may be such as to<br>
10	delete the predetermined text content, or to replace the letters of the predetermined test<br>
	content with meaningless characters.<br>
	Preferably, step a) is carried out by downloading the rule set from a network operator.<br>
15	Advantageously, the method further comprises the step of modifying the rule set, by the<br>
	user of a telecommunications device, to accommodate the needs of that user.<br>
	The invention also provides a telecommunications device comprising a -transceiver, a<br>
	processor and a display, the processor including software containing a rule set, means<br>
20	for reading an incoming message, means for modifying the message if that message<br>
	breaks a rule of the rule set whereby a modified massage is shown on the display,<br>
	wherein the rule set comprises a plurality of rules, each of which, relates to a respective<br>
	predetermined message content.<br>
25	Preferably, the software is such that a user of the device can modify the rule set.<br>
	In a preferred embodiment, the device further comprises data input means linked to the<br>
	processor for modifying the rule set. Conveniently, a keypad constitutes the data input<br>
	Means.<br>
30<br><br>
3<br>
	Where the message is a text message, the software may be such as to parse the<br>
	incoming text message, and such as to delete the predetermined text content, or to<br>
	replace letters of the predetermined text content with meaningless characters.<br>
5	The invention will now be described in greater detail, by way of example, with<br>
	reference to the drawing, the single figure of which is a schematic representation of a<br>
	mobile phone.<br>
	Referring to the drawing, a mobile phone includes a processor 1, a keypad 2, a display 3<br>
10	and an antenna 4. The keypad 2 can be used, in known manner, to input text messages<br>
	for processing by the processor 1 and transmitting via the antenna 4, to the mobile<br>
	phones of other users. Text messages received from other users via the antenna 4 are<br>
	processed by the processor 1 and shown on the display 3.<br>
15	In order to carry out the invention, a rule set is input into the processor 1. The inputting<br>
	of the rule set can be carried out prior to the purchase of the mobile phone, or can be<br>
	downloaded from a network operator via the antenna 4. In either case, the rule set can<br>
	be modified to comply with the individual needs of the user of the mobile phone, the<br>
	operator of the mobile network, or even by particular local requirements. For example,<br>
20	there may be local requirements for content filtering based on both the fashion of the<br>
	day and the geographical location. In particular, new vernacular words, specifically<br>
	those which might cause offence, enter and leave the language regularly, due to the fact<br>
	that language is ever changing. In addition, some words and phrases only have an<br>
	offensive meaning in certain geographical locations (for example the word "fag" is<br>
25	offensive in the USA, but not in the UK). The mobile network operator may also be<br>
	provided with a facility for pre-storing the rule set, for downloading the rule set and/or<br>
	permitting the user to edit the rule set on the mobile phone.<br>
	The rule set will be an algorithm which will first parse each incoming text message, and<br>
30	then each rule will, in turn, read the parsed text content to determine whether or not that<br>
	particular rule has been violated. For example, one rule may search for a given rude<br>
	word, other roles may search for other rude words, and yet other rules may search for<br><br>
4<br>
	particular words or phrases of a racist character. The rule set is such that, if a given rule<br>
	is violated, the software (the algorithm) will then process the message in accordance<br>
	with that rule, for example, by deleting the text content which violates the rule, or by<br>
	modifying that text content, for example, or by replacing the text letters with<br>
5	meaningless characters such as asterisks. Thus, each rule may have different modifying<br>
	actions for given degrees of offensiveness. In particular, if the rule is to look for one of<br>
	a given list of "four letter" words, the user could modify the basic rule set originally<br>
	input into the processor I, so as to vary the actions carried out in dependence upon how<br>
	that user rates the offensiveness of the various words in the list. In this case for text<br>
10	content which is deemed least offensive by the user, the rule set may be such as to allow<br>
	that content to be displayed.<br>
	It will be apparent that modifications could be made to the invention as described above<br>
	with reference to the drawing. In particular, data input can be carried out by any<br>
15	suitable means, and is not restricted to the use of the keypad 2. For example, data could<br>
	be input into the mobile phone 1 by downloading from a PC, or by utilising speech<br>
	recognition software. In this connection, data input covers both the inputting of text<br>
	messages and any modification of the rule set contained in the mobile phone 1. It will<br>
	also be apparent that the invention is not restricted to the filtering of messages received<br>
20	by mobile phones, and is also applicable to other devices such as personal digital<br>
	assistants (PDAs) and wireless gaming devices. Moreover, the invention is equally<br>
	applicable to the filtering of other forms of messages received by communications<br>
	devices such as mobile phones, and is not restricted to the filtering of the content of text<br>
	messages.<br><br>
