The invention relates to a spinning machine with a condensing device.<br>
A device of this kind is known from US-A 4 488 397 in which a fibre structure is guided over a moved guiding surface of a condensing element, with the guide surface exerting a tensile force on the fibre structure and air which flows laterally onto the fibre structure and is sucked off into the interior of the guide surface presses protruding edge fibres of the fibre structure against the same. Furthermore, such a condensing element further prevents the dissolution of a twist in the fibre structure or yam downstream of the condensing element when a twist imparting device is provided downstream of the condensing element. Such a condensing device is provided in a spinning machine preferably between a drafting arrangement and a ring spinning device. The condensing element can preferably be a take-off roller of the drafting arrangement which cooperates with a pressing roller. In the case of the aforementioned US patent the condenser element is provided downstream of the drafting arrangement.<br>
A serious problem in processing certain materials with such condensing elements with a smooth surface could be that the fibre structure is guided insufficiently, particularly when the condensing element is also being used for conveying the fibre structure.<br>
The present invention is based on the object of substantially improving the guidance of the fibre structure on the condensing element.<br>
It has been seen in practice that such breakthroughs in the shape of an oblong hole substantially facilitate the conveyance of the fibre structure and simultaneously also improve the placement of the edge fibres against the fibre structure as a result of the<br><br>
smooth run. This is especially the case when several oblong-hole-like breakthroughs are disposed next to one another in rows parallel to an axis of the condensing element and when successive rows of oblong-hole-like breakthroughs with an offset arrangement are formed in the direction of guidance of the fibre structure.<br>
A similar advantage is also achieved in such a way that one or several oblong holes are provided in a row, but the entire row is positioned inclined to the direction of guidance of the fibre structure.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the oblong-hole-like breakthroughs are to be disposed at the base of recesses of a cannelure and/or on an elevation between two recesses. A condensing element with cannelures has the advantage that the pulling off of the fibre structure is improved by the roughness of the surface.<br>
It is also possible that round breakthroughs are also provided between the oblong-hole¬like breakthroughs in the row. It is also intended to provide the oblong-hole-like breakthroughs with different length and/or widths. In this way it is possible to take into account the special requirements that are placed by a special fibre structure for example.<br>
The invention is now explained by reference to the enclosed embodiments, wherein:<br>
Fig. 1	shows a schematic cross-sectional view through a spinning machine with<br>
a condensing device for condensing a fibre structure;<br>
Fig. 2	shows a partially shown developed view of a condensing element;<br>
Fig. 3	shows a partially shown cross section through the condensing element<br>
according to fig. 2;<br><br>
Fig. 4	shows a partially shown developed view of a further embodiment of a<br>
condensing element;<br>
Fig. 5	shows a partially shown cross-sectional view through the condensing<br>
element according to fig. 4;<br>
Figs. 6 to 8 show partially represented developed views of further embodiments of a condensing element.<br>
A material feed 1 according to fig. 1 consists in a conventional spinning machine either of a can or of a roving bobbin. A fibre structure 2 is supplied from the can to the drafting arrangement. In the case of a roving bobbin, a roving is drawn off from the circumference of the bobbin. The fibre structure, namely the roving or the sliver, reaches the zone of a drafting arrangement 4 via a deflection apparatus. The drafting arrangement comprises several pairs of delivery rollers, which are partly equipped with aprons. The fibre structure 2 is drafted only in a weak manner between the first and second pair of delivery rollers 5a and 5 b and strongly between the second and downstream pair of rollers 5 in a nip roller 7 and a condensing element 6, whereby the drafting ratio can in total exceed the value of 100.<br>
The drafted fibre structure is nipped between the nip roller 7 and the condensing element 6 and condensed downstream in a condensing device 8.<br>
The fibre structure leaving the drafting arrangement 1 has a width which decreases during the condensing. A guide means 10, preferably in the form of a screen, can accompany the fibre structure 2 along a condensing zone 9 on the surface of the condensing element 6.<br>
Finally, a blocking roller 11 is provided in the condensing zone which is pressed against the condensing element 6 and thus limits the imparting of a twist by a spinning device<br><br>
12 against the direction of the material flow. A suction element 13 is disposed in the interior of the condensing element 6 which is connected to a suction device 14.<br>
The condensing element 6 is preferably a perforated rotating cylinder or a flexible apron, whereas the suction element 13 is provided with a suction opening in the zone of<br>
the perforation.<br>
The thread guides 15, 15' are disposed between the drafting arrangement 4 and the spinning device 12, which thread guides upwardly limit the balloon of yarn 16 according to fig. 1 in the case of a ring spinning device.<br>
In the lower range of the spinning device the yarn 16 is wound up on a yarn package 30 by means of a traveller 17 on a ring which is fastened to a ring frame 18 through the rotation of a spindle 19 with drive. The height of the yarn package is defined by the range of movement of the ring frame drive which reciprocates the ring frame 18 up and down in the vertical direction according to fig. 1.<br>
In the embodiment of a condensing element 6.1 according to figs. 2 and 3, breakthroughs 22 are disposed in a moved surface 21, in particular in a roller jacket. It can be seen in fig. 2 in particular that said breakthroughs are provided with an oblong-hole-like arrangement, which means that each breakthrough 22 is provided with a length I and width b and is provided in its entirety with a slot-like arrangement. The distance a of the rows from the breakthroughs 22 is close to 
In fig. 2, the breakthroughs 22 are disposed in rows approximately perpendicular to a guiding direction of the fibre structure 2 which is indicated by the arrow 23. It is intended that the breakthroughs 22, as shown in fig. 4, are disposed in the guiding direction 23 behind one another or, as is shown in fig. 2, offset towards each other. The width and the height of the remaining bridges is approx. 0.5 mm in order to provide as many breakthroughs 22 as possible.<br><br>
In the embodiment of a condensing element 6.2 according to figs. 4 and 5, the breakthroughs 22 are additionally arranged in cannelures 24. A cannelure 24 is formed as elevations 25 and recesses in succession.<br>
Fig. 6 shows further that the oblong-hole-like projections 22.1 can also be positioned inclined at a predetermined desired angle a, preferably up to 10° to the perpendicular to the direction of guidance 23. This is provided for in a further embodiment of a condensing element 6.3. The length h of this condensing element, as measured from the centre points of the radii at either side, is approx. 5-15 mm, and the width approx. 0.5-2 mm.<br>
The figs. 7 and 8 show that round breakthroughs 26 can also be provided between the individual breakthroughs 22, especially in the row between the breakthroughs.<br><br><br>
