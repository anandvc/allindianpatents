DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now, an automated manufacturing system of a lithium secondary battery according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a system according to the present invention can be divided into the following various units, and all the units may be installed at one frame or respective separate frames that can be integrated into one. In addition, each unit is servo-controlled by a control unit (not shown).<br>
The system 300 comprises a supply unit 310 having a separator roller 315 rotatably installed at a frame 301 so that a separator 311 can be released and travel along a travel path 313, an adhesive applying unit 320 disposed to have the travel path 313 through the adhesive applying unit 320 so as to continuously apply adhesive to both surfaces of the separator 311 in a predetermined pattern, a lamination unit 330 for simultaneously laminating both a plurality of positive electrode plates and a plurality of negative electrode plates on respective surfaces of the separator 311 to which adhesive has been applied so that positive and negative electrode plates can correspond to the predetermined pattern, a transporting unit 340 which contacts the separator 311 supplied from the supply unit 310, and rotates so as to cause the separator 311 to travel along its travel path 313 at<br>
a predetermined speed and during predetermined time intervals, a packing unit 350 for folding and packing one batch of the separator 311 which has been laminated with the positive and negative electrode plates in the predetermined pattern by the lamination unit 330 so that the positive and negative electrode plates alternate with each other, and the section of the separator 311 can have the shape of "Z", and an unloading unit for unloading the packed separator 311 to a tray unit 370.<br>
The frame 301 can be divided into a first frame 303 on which the supply unit 310 and the adhesive applying unit 320 are installed, a second frame 305 on which the lamination unit 330 is installed, and a third frame unit 307 on which the transporting unit 340, the packing unit 350, the unloading unit 360 and the tray unit 370 are installed.<br>
The frame 301 may be divided into a lower frame at which a plurality of supporting pillars 309 for supporting the system 300 apart from a floor are installed, and an upper frame on which components of the system 300 are seated. Various driving motors, a vacuum system, an air system, an electronic system, an adhesive supplying system, and the like are provided at the lower frame. It is preferable that the upper surface of the upper frame is arranged to be in an accurately horizontal state.<br>
Since all the following components of the present invention, which will be described below, are installed at the frame 301, and various brackets, blocks, plates, housings, covers, collars, and the like are ancillary elements for installing respective components at the frame 301, it is made a principle that the ancillary elements are generally called the frame 301 except particular cases.<br>
FIGS. 2A and 2B are front and plan views of a supply unit and an adhesive applying unit that are shown in FIG. 1.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the supply unit 310 comprises the above-mentioned separator roller 315, a plurality of guide rollers 317 for guiding the travel of the separator 311, and a dancing roller 319 for storing a predetermined length of the separator 311<br>
released from the separator roller 315, and, in addition, for adjusting the tension of the separator 311.<br>
The separator roller 315 may be configured so that the separator roller 315 is naturally rotated by the tension of the separator 311, or may be configured so that the separator roller 315 is rotated by the tension of the separator 311 while the tension is adjusted by a servomotor which is controlled by an encoder 347, and is interlocked with the encoder 347. Here, the separator 311 is intended to electrically insulate the positive electrode and the negative electrode from each other in a battery, and it is preferable that the separator 311 having a single-layered or multi-layered structure is made of a porous polymeric film of polyethylene (PE) or polypropylene (PP). The width and thickness of the separator 311 may vary with the type of finally produced battery.<br>
The guide rollers 317 are horizontally installed at a roller bracket 314 installed on the frame 301, and rotate freely while contacting the separator 311. The dancing roller 319 is installed at a dancing arm 316 disposed at the roller bracket 314 to be pivotable.<br>
While the dancing roller 319 controls the tension of the separator 311 which maintains its predetermined travel path according to a zigzag travel path 313 formed by the guide rollers 317, and is drawn from the separator roller 315 by the pivoting motion of the dancing bar 316, the dancing roller 319 is re-supplied with the drawn quantity of the separator 311 from the separator roller 315. To this end, the supply unit 310 is provided with a potentiometer (not shown) which is controlled by the control unit and is intended to decide the tension of the separator 311 and the time of supply of the separator 311 by detecting a pivoting position of the dancing arm 316.<br>
In addition, the supply unit 310 is provided with a stopper member 318 for selectively stopping the separator 311 which continuously travels via the guide rollers 317. The stopper member 318 comprises a clamp base 318A fixedly installed on the frame 301 to be in a position below the travel path 313, and a supply stopper 318B which is positioned<br>
over the travel path 313, and is raised and lowered by a stopper cylinder 318B so as to be able to selectively approach the upper surface of the clamp base 318A.<br>
FIG. 3 is a right-side view of the adhesive applying unit portion of FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 through FIG. 3, the adhesive applying unit 320 comprises a bracket 321 installed on the frame 301 so that the position of the bracket 321 can be adjustable with respect to the frame 301, and a pair of air injectors 325 which are installed at the bracket 321 to be raised and lowered by respective cylinders 323 and are separately positioned over and below the travel path 313.<br>
The adhesive applying unit 320 must be set at a corresponding position along the travel path 313 depending on the type and number of positive electrode plates and negative electrode plates which are adhered to the separator 311 and the type of battery. Therefore, the bracket 321 is installed on the frame 301 so that the position of the bracket 321 can be adjusted with respect to the frame 301 by a first position adjusting member 327 comprising an LM guide, movement rails, a first handle, and the like.<br>
The air injector 325 is a device to which the printing principle of 'Ink-jet Marking' is applied, and is intended to jet adhesive liquid stored in a predetermined container through a nozzle by using compressed air. It is preferable that the nozzle of the air injector 325 is capable of forming an adhesive pattern having a predetermined shape on the surface of the separator 311.<br>
FIG. 4 is a plan view illustrating a separator a surface of which an adhesive has been applied to by the adhesive applying unit shown in FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, it is preferable that a unit adhesive applied portion has an annular shape (a doughnut shape). The reason is that the contacting area between the adhesive layer and an electrode plate and the thickness of the adhesive layer can be reduced, and excessive consumption of the adhesive can be prevented.  Therefore, the so-called string<br>
effect can be reduced, and, ultimately, electron conductivity of the electrode plate can be enhanced. To this end, it is preferable that the inner diameter of the nozzle of the air injector 325 is about 50 ~ 300 um. As a matter of course, the nozzle may jet the adhesive to a surface of the separator 311 in a dot shape, or in a line shape, or may jet the adhesive to the whole surface of the separator 311.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, the air injectors 325 are symmetrically disposed with respect to the travel path 313. Therefore, the adhesive jetted by the two air injectors 325 disposed to face each other is simultaneously applied to both surfaces of the horizontally traveling separator 311. Accordingly, since the adhesive is simultaneously applied to both surfaces of the separator 311, efficiency of the adhesive applying process can be enhanced.<br>
In addition, in order to dry the adhesive jetted on the both surfaces of the separator 311, adhesive drying members 329 are installed over and below the travel path 313. It is preferable that the adhesive drying member 329 has an air nozzle structure for jetting dry air, and the operation thereof is selectively controlled by the control unit.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 2A and 2B, a travel guide member 322 is installed between the adhesive applying unit 320 and the lamination unit 330. The travel guide member 322 is intended to prevent the separator 311 having passed the adhesive applying unit 320 from being loosened, and is installed to be disposed below the travel path 313 and to be able to contact the lower surface of the separator 311. The travel guide member 322 comprises a guide block 324 installed on the frame 301, and a side guide 326 which has a finished upper surface and is installed on the guide block 324 to project toward the adhesive applying unit 320 and the lamination unit 330.<br>
FIGS. 5 A through 5C are, respectively, front, plan, and right side views of the lamination unit portion of FIG. 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 and FIGS. 5A through 5C, the lamination unit 330 is intended to simultaneously attach and laminate a batch of positive electrode plates and negative<br>
electrode plates to two respective surfaces of the separator 311, to which the adhesive has been applied in a predetermined pattern, so that the electrode plates correspond to the predetermined pattern.<br>
The lamination unit 330 comprises a stacking member 110 provided with a plurality of positive-electrode-plate storing portions 112 each of which a multitude of positive electrode plates are stored in, and a plurality of negative-electrode-plate storing portions 114 each of which a multitude of negative electrode plates are stored in, which, i.e., the portions 112 and the portions 114, are disposed to be asymmetrical about the separator 311, a pivoting member 120 comprised of positive-electrode-plate pivoting members 122 and negative-electrode-plate pivoting members 124 which are installed at the frame 301 to be pivotable so as to face the positive-electrode-plate storing portions 112 and the negative-electrode-plate storing portions 114, respectively, and a pushing member 130 comprising positive-electrode-plate pushing members 132 and negative-electrode-plate pushing members 134 which are installed to be linearly movable with respect to the respective positive-electrode-plate pivoting members 122 and the respective negative-electrode-plate pivoting members 124 so that the positive electrode plates 102 and the negative electrode plates 104 which are stored in the stacking member 110 can be attached and laminated to the separator 311, respectively.<br>
The stacking member 110 is a storage place for arranging and storing positive electrode plates and negative electrode plates so that the positive electrode plates and the negative electrode plates which are required for a battery, (for example, when 5 positive electrode plates are required for a battery, 6 negative electrode plates are disposed so that one more negative electrode plate can be attached to a separator), can be attached to a separator simultaneously, and is divided into a positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 and a negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 for storing positive electrode plates and negative electrode plates, respectively. The positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 and the negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 are asymmetrically disposed with respect to the horizontal travel path 313 of the separator 311. That is, when the positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 is positioned at a first step, the negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 is<br>
positioned at a second step. As a matter of course, the opposite is possible. Though the positions thereof and the facing directions thereof are different from each other, the positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 and the negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 have the same structure. The positive electrode plate 102 is a standardized product made by applying a positive active material such as LiCO2, or LiMn2O2 having a spinel structure or a layered structure to the surface of a metal plate such as an aluminium foil, drying the applied positive active material, cutting the metal plate into pieces of a predetermined size, and providing a positive tab at a predetermined position.

Referring to FIG. 1 and FIGS. 13A and 13B, the tape supplying member 270 comprises a tape supplying roller 264 and a plurality of tape guiding rollers 266 which are installed at the frame 301, and a pair of tape attaching rollers 272 which are installed at one end of a cylinder 268 installed at the frame 301 to be raised or lowered by the cylinder 268 and are positioned on the travel path of the tape 262 so that one end of the tape 262 can selectively contact the upper surface of the separator 311.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 14A and 14B, the holder member 244 is disposed to correspond to the tape attaching rollers 272. The holder member 242 is intended to prevent a non-attached area of the separator 311 from fluttering since the separator 311 is cut before a piece of separator 311 is taped, and, therefore, the fluttering occurs. To this end, the holder member 244 comprises a bracket 274 installed at the frame 301, and a holding roller 278 installed so as to be selectively raised and lowered by a cylinder 276 installed at a bracket 274 until the holding roller 278 contact the lower surface of the separator 311.<br>

The operation of the automated manufacturing system of a lithium secondary battery configured as above according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described.<br>
First, the power of the system 300 is turned on, and data required for the control unit is set. Then, the separator 311 wound around the separator roller 315 is drawn from the supply unit 310, is caused to position along the travel path 313 of the separator 311 in the adhesive applying unit 320 and the lamination unit 330, and is inserted into a gap between the conveyor members 343. These procedures can be performed after the operation mode of the control unit is changed into a manual mode so that the individual components can be moved manually or the gap between the components can be widened. Thereafter, positive electrode plates 102 and negative electrode plates 104 are stored in the positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 and the negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 of the lamination unit 330.   In addition, quantity of adhesive required for the adhesive<br>
applying unit 320, the air system, and the like are checked. Whether or not all the components of the system 300 have been prepared for a normal operation can be confirmed in advance by changing the operation mode of the control unit into a warming-up mode.<br>
Subsequently, when a start button of the control unit is pressed, the conveyor members 343 of the transporting unit 340 circulate. Then, the separator 311 interposed between the pair of conveyor members 343 is drawn to the tray unit 370, and, during this process, while the separator 311 wound around the separator roller 315 is guided by the guide rollers 317 of the supply unit 310, and the tension of the separator 311 is adjusted by the dancing roller 319, the separator 311 enters the adhesive applying unit 320.<br>
Thereafter, while the separator 311 passes through the adhesive applying unit 320, adhesive is applied to both surfaces of the separator 311 by the nozzles of the air injectors 325 to form a predetermined adhesive pattern. The adhesive applied to the separator 311 is dried by dry air injected by the adhesive drying members 329. In addition, the separator 311 is stopped at a predetermined position of the lamination unit 330 while being guided by the travel guide member 322.<br>
Subsequently, in a state that the separator 311 is stopped at the lamination unit 330, the control unit causes the stacking member 110 of the lamination unit 330 to operate. Then, the positive-electrode-plate pressing plates 106 and the negative-electrode-plate pressing plates 108 are moved toward the positive electrode plates 102 and the negative electrode plates 104, respectively, to press the electrode plates 102 and 104. Meanwhile, the positive-clectrode-plate pivoting members 122 and the negative-electrode-plate pivoting members 124 are pivoted by an angle of 90° from a state in which the positive-electrode-plate pivoting members 122 and the negative-electrode-plate pivoting members 124 face the travel path 313 so as to face the positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 and the ncgative-clectrode-plate magazine 118, respectively. In addition, the positive-electrode-plate pushing members 132 and the negative-electrode-plate pushing members 134 are moved toward the positive electrode plate 102 and the negative electrode plate 104, and<br>
hold a batch of positive electrode plates 102 and negative electrode plates 104 which are stored in the positive-electrode-plate magazine 116 and the negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 by using respective absorbing forces.<br>
Thereafter, after the pushing members 132 and 134 have held the respective electrode plates 102 and 104, the pressing forces applied to the positive-electrode-plate pressing plates 106 and the negative-electrode-plate pressing plates 108 are released, and the positive-clectrode-plate pivoting members 122 and the negative-electrode-plate pivoting members 124 are pivoted, in reverse directions, to face the travel path 313. Thereafter, the positive-electrode-plate pushing members 132 and the negative-electrode-plate pushing members 134 press the respective positive electrode plates 102 and the respective negative electrode plates 104 to both surfaces of the separator 311 positioned along the travel path 313, simultaneously. Then, the positive electrode plates 102 and the negative electrode plates 104 are attached to both surfaces of the separator 311 by respective adhesion forces of the adhesive applied to both surfaces of the separator 311, and, at the same time, the absorbing forces applied to the positive-electrode-plate pushing members 132 and the negative-electrode-plate pushing members 134 are released.<br>
Thereafter, the separator 311 to which the positive electrode plates 102 and the negative electrode plates 104 have been attached are moved by the transporting unit 340, and, subsequently, a new batch of the separator 311 to which the adhesive were applied are supplied to the lamination unit 330.<br>
During these steps, the aligned state of the positive electrode plates 102 and the negative electrode plates 104 respectively stored in the positive-electrode-plate storing portions 112 and the negative-electrode-plate storing portions 114 may become improper due to pressing forces of the positive-electrode-plate pressing plates 106 and the negative-electrode-plate pressing plates 108 and pushing forces of the positive-electrode-plate pushing members 122 and the negative-electrode-plate pushing members 124. In this case, the positive-electrode-plate aligning member 142 and the negative-electrode-plate aligning member 144 are operated so that the positive electrode plates 102 and the<br>
negative electrode plates 104 positioned at the leading ends of the positive-electrode-platc magazine 116 and the negative-electrode-plate magazine 118 can be aligned by the positive-electrode-plate aligning bar 141 and the negative-electrode-plate aligning bar.<br>
In addition, a length of first one batch of the leading end portion of the separator 311 which have passed the transporting unit 340 must be cut away.<br>
Thereafter, while the separator 311 passing through the leading ends of the conveyor members 343 of the transporting unit 340 is guided by the guiding jaw 218, the separator 311 begins to be supplied to the receiving rack 212 of the base member 210. In this step, the separator 311 is biased toward the stopper member 230 by the air blowing force generated by the air nozzle 215 of the biasing member 213.<br>
In this state, the folder plate 232 of the folder member 230 continuously presses the separator 311 supplied to the receiving space and biased by a predetermined times, and folds the separator 311 so that the sections of both sides of the separator 311 can have the shape of "Z", and the positive electrode plates 102 and the negative electrode plates 104 can alternate with each other. Then, the stopper member 220 is raised in a state that the folder plate 232 presses a piece of separator 311 against the receiving rack 212. Subsequently, the clamp members 242 of the cutting/taping member 240 are caused to approach the both sides of the base member 210, and clamp both sides of the piece of separator 311 folded in the shape of "Z". Together with the clamping operation, the folder plate 232 is raised.<br>
Thereafter, the clamp members 242 are operated to move the piece of separator 311 horizontally to a taping position. Subsequently, the tape supplying member 270 is operated to cause the leading end of the tape 262 to adhere to the upper surface of the piece of separator 311 positioned at the taping position. At the same time, the holder member 244 is raised to cause the holding roller 278 to contact the lower surface of the separator 311. Therefore, since the tape attaching rollers 272 and the holding roller 278 hold the separator 311, the separator 311 does not flutter.<br>
Subsequently, the cutting member 250 is lowered to cut the leading end of a non-attached area of the piece of separator 311. Then, the heating cutter 258 heated to a predetermined temperature cuts the separator 311.<br>
Thereafter, while the piece of separator 311 to which the leading end of the tape 262 is adhered is rotated at both ends thereof, the clamp rotating members 280 are operated to tape the piece of separator 311. Then, the finger members 245 are rotated by the stepping motors 282, and, at the same time, the tape 262 supplied from the tape supplying member 270 is naturally wound around the piece of separator 311 to tape the piece of separator 311.<br>
Subsequently, the tape cutting member 290 is operated to cut the loose end of the tape 262 extended from the taped piece of separator 311. Then, the cutting wire 295 is moved to cut the tape 262 by using heat, and the packing operation is finally completed.<br>
Thereafter, after the first unloading air fingers 379 installed at the first unloading horizontal block 378 of the first unloading member 372 are passed the piece of separator 311 held by the finger members 245 of the of the clamp members 242, the first unloading air fingers 379 are moved horizontally and rotated vertically by an angle of 180°. Then, after the second unloading air fingers 387 of the unloading member 374 are passed the piece of separator 311 from the first air fingers 379, the second unloading air fingers 387 is moved vertically and, then, rotated vertically by an angle of 180°, and lay the piece of separator 311 on the tray 391. The second unloading member 374 is returned to its original position in reverse order to the above-described order.<br>
During these operations, the transporting unit 240 is continuously supplying the separator 311 from the supply unit 310 to the adhesive applying unit 320, the adhesive applying unit 320 is applying the adhesive to another batch of separator 311, and the lamination<br>
unit 330 laminates the separator 311 with a batch of positive and negative electrode plates 102 and 104.<br>
In addition, when the tray 391 of the tray unit 370 is full of pieces of separator 311, the tray 391 is separated from the tray unit 370, and the other vacant tray 391 disposed thereby is moved horizontally to an unloading position. Meanwhile, the tray 391 full of the pieces of separator 311 unloads the received pieces of separator 311 to a separate space, and the vacant tray 391 is positioned again at a spare position.<br>
As described above, the automated manufacturing system of a lithium secondary battery according to the present invention has the following advantages.<br>
First, the overall efficiency of production thereof can be enhanced due to the employment of the automated manufacturing system, and a rate of defective secondary batteries can be lowered.<br>
Second, since the travel path of the separator is arranged to be horizontal, a row of positive electrode plates and a row of negative electrode plates, i.e., a batch of positive and negative electrode plates are attached and laminated to both surfaces of the separator at the same time, efficiency of the manufacturing operations and productivity of secondary batteries can be enhanced.<br>
Third, in the adhesive applying unit 320, since a predetermined pattern of adhesive applied portions are formed by applying the printing principle of Ink-jet Marking, contact areas between a adhesive layer and an electrode plate and a thickness of the adhesive layer can be reduced, and, therefore, excessive use of adhesive can be prevented and the so-called string effect can be reduced, and, ultimately, electron (or ion) conductivity of the electrode plate can be enhanced. In addition, a quantity of adhesive being sprayed can be controlled with ease.<br>
Fourth, since standardized, well-arranged magazines are employed, events in which electrode plates are inadequately aligned when the electrode plates are laminated to the separator can be prevented. Therefore, productivity of secondary batteries and quality thereof can be enhanced.<br>
Fifth, since the separator both surfaces of which positive electrode plates and negative electrode plates are attached to, respectively, can be folded by serialized operations of the receiving rack, the stopper member, and the pressing plate so that both side sections of the folded separator can have the shape of "Z", productivity of secondary batteries can be enhanced markedly.<br>
Sixth, since folded pieces of separator can be continuously moved, and taped by automated robot equipments, productivity of secondary batteries and efficiency of manufacturing processes can be enhanced.<br>
While this invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
