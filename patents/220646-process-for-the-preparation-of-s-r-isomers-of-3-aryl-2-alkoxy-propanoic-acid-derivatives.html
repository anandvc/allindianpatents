TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF S (-) &amp; R (+) ISOMERS OF 3-ARYL-2-ALKOXY PROPANOIC ACID DERIVATIVES"<br>
We, CADILA HEALTHCARE LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of Zydus Tower, Satellite Cross Road, Ahmedabad - 380014, Gujarat, India.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention:<br>
1<br><br><br>
 5 JUL 2007<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of S (-) &amp; R (+) isomers of 3-aryl 2-alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives of the structural formula (la) &amp; (lb) respectively,<br><br>
The compound of formula (la) &amp; (lb) where R3 = -H, is useful as an intermediate for the preparation of many pharmaceutically active compounds. Background &amp; prior art<br>
S (-)-3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives are essential intermediates for the preparation of a number of promising drugs. These compounds also have been considered useful for the treatment of eating disorders. They are also used as sweetening agents, in photosensitive materials and also in liquid crystals.<br>
S (-)-3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives have been prepared by several methods in the literature such as by classical resolution i.e. by crystallization of diastereomeric salts of the racemates or by using chiral precursor. However, in all the processes resolution has been carried out in atleast one step to obtain optically pure S (-) isomer of structural formula (la) (where R3 = H). Such processes are described in WO 0026200, WO 0140159, WO 0224625, WO 9962871 and WO 0063189. The processes described in WO 0026200 (Rao et. al.) uses benzyl bromide for benzylation, which is highly lachrymatory. Again, in the processes described, the debenzylation of the final intermediate was done by using Pd/C under pressure. Such a process is costly and not very efficient at a large scale. WO 0224625 describes a process for preparing chirally pure S (-) alkyl-2-alkoxy-3-(4-benzyloxyphenyl) propanoate. However, the process for obtaining the chirally pure product involves the following steps:<br><br><br>
HSM-MC-014<br>
&amp;<br>
s, the process of obtaining the chirally pure product from the partially racemized (S) isomer involves 5 extra steps thereby increasing the manufacturing cost and reducing the overall yield.<br>
Deussen et al. (Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 7, 82-88 (2003)) describes the enantioselective enzymatic hydrolysis of Ethyl-2-ethoxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate for the large scale production of S (-) &amp; R (+) isomers of structural formula (la) &amp; (lb), where R3=H.<br>
The preparation of the R (+) isomer [1(b)] has also been reported in WO 0111072 &amp; WO 0111073 (Deussen etal).<br>
WO 0140159 (Andersson et. al.) describes a process for preparing compounds of formula (la), when R3 = H, using alkylthiol and base at higher temperature as the deprotecting agent. Also the pure (S) isomer was obtained by a sequence of steps similar to those used in WO 0224625 thereby affecting the manufacturing cost &amp; yield.<br>
The problems indicated above, apparently depicts that there is a need to develop a process, which obviates these difficulties. The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of S (-) &amp; R (+) 3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives of the structural formula (la) &amp; (lb) respectively, which not only overcomes the draw backs of prior art, but also provides an improved process which possess several advantages like operational simplicity, cost effectiveness and easily implementable on a large scale. The present invention relates to an improved process of preparation of S (-) &amp; R (+) 3-aryl-2- alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives of the structural formula (la) &amp; (lb) respectively, of high chemical and chiral purity. Objectives of present invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of S (-) &amp; R (+) 3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives of formula (la) &amp;<br>
(lb) respectively, with high chemical and chiral purity.<br>
A further objective is to prepare compounds of formula (la), where R3 = H, having more than<br>
or equal to D99 % e.e. by HPLC analysis without any resolution.<br>
Another objective of is to provide a cost-effective, safe and efficient process for obtaining<br>
chirally pure compounds of formula (la) &amp; (lb) respectively.<br>
A further objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the large scale<br>
production of compound of formula (la) &amp; (lb) in a chirally pure form.<br>

HSM-MC-014<br>
^Pltailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention describes an improved process for the preparation of compound of the general formula (La) and (lb).<br><br>
Wherein, R  represent H or (C1-C6) alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl,<br>
butyl, isobutyl, t-butyl and the like.<br>
R2 represents (C1-C6) alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, t-<br>
butyl and the like.<br>
R3 represents H, protecting groups such as benzyl, substituted benzyl, (C1-C3) alkyl and like.<br>
Preparation of compound (la):<br>
Compound of general formula (la) can be prepared according to the following schemes:<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
Step 1: Selective O-alkylation or O-aralkylation of L-Tyrosine of formula (2a) using a base, a chelating agent, an alkyl or aralkyl halide in the presence of solvents to obtain the<br><br>
HSM-MC-014<br>
|ptnpound of formula (3a) (according to the general method described in "The practice of peptide synthesis", Bodanszky et. al., pp 50)<br>
The selective O-alkylation or O-aralkylation of compound of formula (2a) can be carried out by reacting a base such as NaOH, KOH, K2C03 and the like, a chelating agent such as CuS04, Cu (OAc)2 and the like, and an alkyl or aralkyl halide in the presence of solvents such as aq. methanol, ethanol, DMF and the like or their combination thereof, at 25 °C-65 °C. The bases may be present in 2-2.5 equivalents, the chelating agent in 0.5-0.7 equivalents, alkyl or aralkyl halide in 1-1.5 eq. and the solvent may be present in 4-20 times to the weight of L-tyrosine. In a preferred embodiment, the base used is KOH (2 to 2.2 eq.), the chelating agent is CuSO4(0.5 to 0.65 eq.), Benzyl chloride is the aralkylating agent and the solvent used is aq. DMF at 50 °C-60 °C, to afford the copper complex of O-benzyl-L-tyrosine. Thus by substituting aqueous methanol (WO 0026200 &amp; WO 0224625) with DMF as the solvent, the rate of reaction is enhanced resulting in higher yield and better purity. Also, the volume of solvent required is reduced substantially (from ~20 times of the starting compound in case of MeOH to 4 times the starting compound in case of DMF).<br>
The crude Cu complex obtained above was purified by treating it with methanol at reflux temperature. Cleavage of the Cu complex using dil. HC1 yielded the compound (3a) in high chemical &amp; chiral purity (e.e.&gt; 99%).<br>
Step 2: Diazotisation of the compound of the formula (3a) using a diazotising agent, in suitable solvents in acidic media to obtain the compound of formula (4a). Diazotisation of the compound of formula (3a) is carried out with sodium nitrite in 2-5 equivalents, preferably 3-4 equivalents and strong acids such as sulfuric acid, orthophosphoric acid, cone. HC1 in 2-8 equivalents, KHSO4, preferably sulfuric acid in 3-5 equivalents at 0 °C to 25 °C. Solvents such as dioxane, acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and the like or their mixtures, preferably dioxane, may be used. [Tetrahedron Lett., 25, 2287-2290(1971) &amp; US 5,747,448 which are incorporated herein as reference]. The hydroxy acid (4a) was obtained in high chemical &amp; chiral purity (e.e. &gt; 98 %) with retention of configuration.<br>
Step 3: Dialkylation of the compound of formula (4a) using an excess of alkylating agent and excess base, in presence of suitable solvent to obtain optically pure compound of formula (la).<br>
Alternatively, compound of formula (4a) may be selectively esterified to obtain compound of formula (5a), which is subsequently O-alkylated to obtain compound of formula (la) (Scheme 2)<br>
5<br><br>
HSM-MC-014<br>
lkylation of the compound of formula (4a) to get the dialkylated compound of formula (la) with high chemical and chiral purity, was carried out by suitably modifying the process reported by Robert A.W. Johnstone et.al. (Tetrahedron, 35, 2169-2173, (1979)), which describes the alkylation of aliphatic alcohols and acids with alkylating agents at ambient temperature i.e. 18-20 °C using an excess of potassium hydroxide as a base and DMSO as a solvent.<br>
According to the modified procedure, dialkylation of the compound of formula (4a) was carried out using an excess of base w.r.to the starting compound, with a suitable alkylating agent in presence of a solvent to obtain the compound of formula (la). Suitable alkylating agents may be alkyl sulfates such as diethyl sulfate, dimethyl sulfate and the like; alkyl halides may be methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, propyl bromide, isopropyl bromide and the like. The solvent used is DMSO. The base may be present in 2 to 7 equivalents, preferably in 5 to 7 equivalents, the alkylating agent is present in equal moles w.r.to the base, and the solvent volume may be 4-10 times w.r.to the weight of the intermediate of formula (4a). Suitable base may be selected from NaH, KOH, t-BuOK and the like. The compound (4a) is obtained with high chemical (&gt; 98 %) and chiral (e. e &gt; 97 %) purity. Prior art for this conversion reports the formation of -20 % byproduct and upto 4 % racemization. (Deussen et. al. Organic Process Research &amp; Development, 2003, 7, 82-88) Selective esterification of compound of formula (4a) to obtain (5a) (Scheme 2) may be carried out using corresponding alcohols such as MeOH, EtOH, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol and the like, in the presence of acids such as H2SO4, p-TSA and the like or mixture thereof or activating reagent such as SOCI2. Alternatively, the esterification may be carried out in the presence of a suitable base selected from Na2C03, K2CO3, KOH, NaOMe, NaOEt and the like or mixture thereof in the presence of corresponding alkylating agents such as methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, dimethyl sulfate, diethyl sulfate and the like in solvents selected from DMF, DMSO and the like or mixtures thereof. The alkylation of compound of formula (5a) to obtain compound of formula (la) may be carried out using an excess of base w.r.to the starting compound, with a suitable alkylating agent in the presence of a solvent to obtain compound of formula (la). Suitable alkylating agents may be alkyl sulfates such as diethyl sulfate, dimethyl sulfate and the like; alkyl halides selected from methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, ethyl bromide, propyl bromide, isopropyl bromide and the like. The solvent used is DMSO. The base may be present in 2 to 7 equivalents, preferably in 5 to 7 equivalents, the alkylating agent is present in equal moles w.r.to the base, and the solvent volume may be 4-10 times w.r.to the weight of the<br>

HSM-MC-014<br>
pfcermediate of formula (5a). Suitable base may be selected from NaH, KOH, t-BuOK and the like.<br>
The crude product of formula (la) was purified by removal of excess alkyl halide or alkyl sulfate to obtain chemically pure and high chirally pure (e.e &gt; 97%) compound of formula (la) without resolution. Removal of excess alkyl halide from the product can be done by vacuum distillation or by reacting with trialkyl amines like triethyl amine. If alkyl sulfate is used, the excess alkyl sulfate, may be removed by treating with an organic base such as, trialkyl amines preferably with triethylamine and diisopropyl ethylamine (1-2 equivalents to alkyl sulfate) in suitable alcohol at a temp, ranging from 25-30 °C to reflux temperature of the solvent. Use of tertiary amine, instead of alkali which is normally used to remove excess of dialkyl sulfates, prevented the hydrolysis of the ester group.<br>
Step 4: Deprotection of the protecting group of compound of formula (la) to obtain further compound of formula [(la), where R3 = H].<br>
The protecting group may be removed using a hard acid and soft nucleophile, optionally in the presence of a solvent at 0 °C-40 °C to obtain the chirally pure (e. e &gt; 99 %) compound of formula (la), (where R3= H). The deprotection may be carried out in the presence of an ester group. Suitable acids for carrying out such deprotection may be Lewis acids such as AICI3, BF3 etherate, BF3 acetate and the like, preferably BF3 etherate in 1.5 to 6 equivalents. Suitable nucleophiles may be alkylthiols like ethanethiol, propanethiol, ethanedithiol, and the like, or suitable alkyl aryl sulphides or dialkyl sulfides, preferably alkyl aryl sulfides more preferably thioanisole, in 1.5-7 equivalents. Solvents, if required may be selected from CH2CI2, CHCI3 and like or mixtures thereof. The product contains less than or equal to 0.3 % of the rearranged product S (-) alkyl-2-alkoxy-3-(3-benzyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate. Suitable proportion of the Lewis acid and nucleophile may be used to minimize or remove the re¬arranged side product.<br>
Alternatively, the deprotection can be carried out by catalytic transfer hydrogenation in a suitable solvent using metal catalysts such as Pd/C (5-10 %) in the presence of a hydrogen donor reagent, at atmospheric pressure and at a temperature ranging from 25 °C to the reflux temperature of the solvent used, to obtain the compound of formula (la), (where R3 = H). Suitable solvents include ethyl acetate, THF, dioxane, glacial acetic acid, aqueous or non aqueous alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and the like or their mixtures. Preferably, ethyl acetate in 5-10 volumes is used. Suitable hydrogen donor reagent may be ammonium formate, cyclohexene, 1,4-cyclohexadiene and the like, preferably, ammonium formate in 3-6 equivalent. The compound of formula (la), where R3 = H, is obtained in high<br>

HSM-MC-014<br>
gjftical purity (having &gt; 99 % e.e) after suitable work up, and chemical purity of more than or equal to 98 % by HPLC analysis. The product often contains less than or equal to 0.3 % of the rearranged product S (-) alkyl-2-alkoxy-3-(3-benzyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) propanoate. One skilled in the art may appreciate that minor differences in the temperature and reaction times may produce the same result and the other temperatures and time may produce the same result under other condition. Advantages of the present process:<br>
1.	The present invention provides a novel process for the preparation of chemically &amp; chirally pure S (-) 3-aryl-2-alkoxy propanoic acid derivatives of formula (la).<br>
2.	The present invention provides a manufacturing process for the preparation of chemically and optically pure compounds of formula (la), without using resolution at any stage.<br>
3.	The invention also describes a process of converting compound of formula (2a) to compound of formula (3a) using DMF as the solvent. This has the benefit of enhancing the reactivity; thereby the reaction goes to completion and the product is obtained in high yield (55 %) with high chemical and chiral purity.<br>
4.	It provides a novel process for the debenzylation or dealkylation of compound of formula (la) to obtain further compound of formula (la), (where R3 = H).<br>
5.	The present invention provides a very mild and cost effective method for debenzylation of compound of formula (la) to give further compounds of formula (la), where R =H, unlike Pd/C under high pressure conditions that are normally used in prior art.<br>
6.	Another advantage is the reduction of reaction time (4-6 hours) during conversion of compound of formula (4a) to (la) compared to that reported in some of the literature ( 24 - 36 hours, WO 0224625).<br>
7.	This invention provides a method to obtain compound of formula (3a) in high assay and purity.<br>
8.	This invention provides a method to remove excess diaikyl sulfate in the presence of sensitive ester functional group during the conversion of compound of formula (4a) to (la) (R3 * H).<br>
9.	The present invention provides an industrial process for the manufacture of compound of formula (la) which is practical, safe and cost effective.<br>
