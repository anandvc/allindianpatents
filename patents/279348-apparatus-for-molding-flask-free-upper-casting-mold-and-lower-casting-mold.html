Patent Document 1: Examined Japanese Patent Application<br>
Publication No. S62-16736<br>
Disclosures of Inventions<br>
[0003]<br>
However, the conventional flaskless molding machine for molding an<br>
upper and a lower mold, which machine is constituted as explained in the<br>
above paragraph, has problems to be solved, such as the flaskless upper mold<br>
and the flaskless lower mold made by the machine do not have enough<br>
uniformity in density of the molding sand.<br>
1<br>
 <br>
[0004]<br>
The present inventions have been conceived to solve the problems.<br>
Namely, the purpose of them is to provide a flaskless molding apparatus for<br>
an upper and a lower mold, which apparatus can produce a flaskless upper<br>
mold and a flaskless lower mold comprised of molding sand with a<br>
substantially uniform density.<br>
[0005]<br>
The flaskless molding apparatus for an upper and a lower mold of<br>
this invention is comprised of:<br>
(a)	a cope flask and a drag flask, wherein each flask has openings at its<br>
both ends and has a sand-filling port at its side wall,<br>
(b)	a conveying mechanism for inserting a match plate between the cope<br>
flask and the drag flask and for taking it out from therebetween,<br>
(c)	a squeezing mechanism to squeeze molding sand, comprising an upper<br>
squeezing means having a plurality of upper segmented-squeeze feet and a<br>
lower squeezing means having a plurality of lower segmented-squeeze feet,<br>
wherein the plurality of upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet<br>
are insertable into each opening of the cope flask and the drag flask<br>
respectively, which openings are positioned on the opposite side of the flask<br>
from the match plate,<br>
wherein the squeezing mechanism allows the match plate to be held<br>
between the cope flask and the drag flask, and<br>
wherein the squeezing mechanism can support and rotate the cope<br>
flask and the drag flask so that the mechanism allows the cope flask and the<br>
drag flask to be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise in a perpendicular<br>
plane about a supporting shaft and so that the cope flask and the drag flask<br>
holding the match plate therebetween can be perpendicularly or horizontally<br>
positioned,<br>
(d)	a driving mechanism to rotate the squeezing mechanism clockwise or<br>
counterclockwise, and<br>
(e)	an sand-supplying mechanism to fill the molding spaces defined by the<br>
match plate and the plurality of the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze<br>
feet opposite to the match plate with the molding sand, through the<br>
sand-filling ports of the cope flask and the drag flask perpendicularly<br>
positioned by the driving mechanism,<br>
the apparatus further comprising a means for moving the<br>
2<br>
 <br>
segmented-squeeze feet so that the positions of the upper and the lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet (which positions determine the condition of the<br>
molding sand in the molding spaces when the spaces are filled with the<br>
molding sand), can be controlled according to the intervals between the<br>
match plate and each of the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet<br>
opposite to the match plate and so that after squeezing the molding sand, the<br>
molds have a substantially uniform density of the molding sand.<br>
[0006]<br>
According to this invention, the flaskless upper mold and the<br>
flaskless lower mold which have enough uniform density of the molding sand<br>
can be produced.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, this invention allows the surface of each of the upper and<br>
the lower mold facing the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet<br>
respectively to be substantially flattened.<br>
Preferred Embodiments of the Invention<br>
[0008]<br>
Preferred embodiments of this invention for a flaskless molding<br>
apparatus for an upper and a lower mold are now explained in detail based<br>
on Figs. 1 - 5. As shown in Figs. 1-4, the flaskless molding apparatus of<br>
this invention for the upper and the lower mold comprises:<br>
a base 1 having an internal space and a rectangular parallelepiped<br>
shape,<br>
two pairs each of cope flasks 2 and drag flasks 3,<br>
a conveying mechanism 4 for inserting a match plate 5 between the<br>
cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 and for taking it out from therebetween,<br>
a squeezing mechanism 9 to squeeze molding sand,<br>
a cylinder 10, disposed in the horizontal direction as a driving<br>
mechanism to rotate the squeezing mechanism 9 clockwise or<br>
counterclockwise,<br>
a sand-supplying mechanism 11 to fill molding spaces with the<br>
molding sand, and<br>
a stripping mechanism 12 to strip the upper and the lower mold.<br>
[0009]<br>
3<br>
 <br>
For each pair of cope flasks 2 and drag flasks 3 of the two pairs of<br>
them, as shown in Figs. 1 and 3, a pair of connecting rods 14 are provided<br>
and vertically extend near the front outer surfaces of the cope flask 2 and the<br>
rear outer surface of cope flask 2 (the right and the left side of the cope flask<br>
2 shown in Fig. 3). The drag flask 3 is sliderably connected to the pair of<br>
connecting rods 14 and disposed therebetween. The drag flask 3 can be<br>
grappled by the lower ends of the pair of connecting rods 14. Protuberances<br>
(not shown, and which are used for holding the flasks by the connecting rods)<br>
are disposed at the centers of the front and rear outer surfaces of the cope<br>
flask 2 and are also disposed at those of the drag flask 3 respectively.<br>
[0010]<br>
As shown in Fig 2, the conveying mechanism 4 for transferring the<br>
match plate 5 into and out of the position, comprises the following:<br>
a ring member 15 disposed around the surface of the supporting shaft<br>
8 of the squeezing mechanism 9,<br>
a cylinder 16 containing a piston rod and connected to a rotating<br>
frame 18, which is explained below, at its base end, and rotatably connected<br>
to a portion of the ring member 15 at the distal end of the piston rod of the<br>
cylinder 16,<br>
a pair of arms 17 fixed to the ring member 15 at its one end in a<br>
cantilevered structure, and<br>
a carrier plate 45 hung from rails so as to be able to hold the match<br>
plate 5 and reciprocate from side to side.<br>
[0011]<br>
Since the pair of arms 17 can rotate upward or downward by the<br>
telescopic motion of the cylinder 16, the carrier plate 45 can insert the match<br>
plate 5 between the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 and take it out from<br>
therebetween, which flasks are located at the squeezing mechanism 9 and<br>
are horizontally positioned, through rails 46, 47, which are explained below<br>
(see Figs. 8-10). Further, when the match plate is changed, by rotating the<br>
pair of the arms 17 upwardly and downwardly while the carrier plate 45 is<br>
slightly lowered by the downward movement of the cope flask 2, the arms 17<br>
can be connected to or disconnected from the carrier plate 45.<br>
[0012]<br>
As shown in Figs 1 and 2, the squeezing mechanism 9 is designed so<br>
that the mechanism 9 can hold the match plate 5 between the cope flask 2<br>
4<br>
 <br>
and the drag flask 3 and so that the plurality of upper and lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a of the upper and the lower squeezing means 6,<br>
7 can be insertable into each of the openings of the cope flask 2 and the drag<br>
flask 3, which openings are opposite to the match plate 5, respectively. In<br>
the squeezing mechanism 9, the rotating frame 18 is connected at a section<br>
near its center portion to the supporting shaft 8, which shaft 8 is disposed at<br>
the center of the upper portion of the base 1, so that the rotating frame 18<br>
can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise in a perpendicular plane about<br>
the supporting shaft 8. A pair of guide rods 19 extending vertically are<br>
disposed, with a predetermined interval therebetween, at the right side of<br>
the rotating frame 18 and at the front and rear sides of the apparatus (the<br>
right and the left side in Fig. 3). An upper lifting and lowering frame 20,<br>
having a reverse Lrshaped configuration, is slidably disposed at upper<br>
portions of the guide rods 19 through holder portions fixed to the upper<br>
lifting and lowering frame 20. Also, a lower lifting and lowering frame 21,<br>
having an L-shaped configuration, is slidably disposed at lower portions of<br>
the guide rods 19 through holder portions fixed to the lower lifting and<br>
lowering frame 21. The upper and the lower lifting and lowering frames 20,<br>
21 can move toward or away from each other by extending or contracting an<br>
upwardly-facing cylinder 22 and a downwardly-facing cylinder 23, which<br>
cylinders are disposed at the rotating frame 18. The rails 46 are disposed at<br>
the rotating frame 18 for guiding the carrier plate 45 when the pair of cope<br>
flasks 2 and drag flasks 3 are positioned horizontally. Further, the rails 47<br>
are disposed at each of the cope flasks 2 for guiding the carrier plate 45 so<br>
that the height of the rails 47 corresponds to that of the rails 46 when the<br>
cope flasks 2 are lifted. (See Figs. 8 - 10.)<br>
[0013]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the upper and the lower squeezing means 6, 7 are<br>
disposed at the upper and the lower lifting and lowering frame 20, 21,<br>
respectively. The upper and the lower squeezing means 6, 7 have a<br>
plurality of cylinders 24, 25 driven by hydraulic pressure as a means for<br>
driving the segmented-squeeze feet, namely for moving the plurality of the<br>
upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a forward or backward.<br>
These means for moving the segmented-squeeze feet can control the<br>
positions of the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a, which<br>
positions determine the condition such as density of the molding sand in the<br>
5<br>
 <br>
molding space when the space is filled with the molding sand, according to<br>
the intervals between the match plate and each of the upper and the lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet opposite to the match plate. The means for moving<br>
the segmented-squeeze feet is operated based on commands from a memory<br>
means (not shown) that stores the data on the configuration of the patterns<br>
on the match plate 5, while the cope flask and the drag flask are positioned<br>
from horizontal to perpendicular state. Each of the upper and the lower<br>
lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 has a proper and horizontal flat surface so<br>
as to be able to engage and push the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0014]<br>
Where the wording of "the means for moving the segmented-squeeze<br>
feet is operated while the cope flask and the drag flask are positioned from<br>
horizontal to perpendicular state" is defined as the state that includes the<br>
following:<br>
(1)	it is operated when the cope flask and the drag flask are positioned<br>
horizontally,<br>
(2)	it is operated when the cope flask and the drag flask are positioned<br>
perpendicularly,<br>
(3)	it is operated while the cope flask and the drag flask are rotating from<br>
horizontal to perpendicular position,<br>
(4)	it is operated starting from the position where the cope flask and the drag<br>
flask are positioned perpendicularly and while the cope flask and the drag<br>
flask rotate from the perpendicular to horizontal position,<br>
(5)	it is operated starting from the position where the cope flask and the drag<br>
flask are positioned horizontally and while the cope flask and the drag flask<br>
rotate from the horizontal to perpendicular position, and<br>
(6)	it is operated during the entire period of rotation from the position where<br>
the cope flask and the drag flask are positioned horizontally or<br>
perpendicularly to the position where the cope flask and the drag flask<br>
complete their rotation and take their perpendicular to horizontal position,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0015]<br>
For an embodiment of this invention, a plurality of the cylinders<br>
driven by hydraulic pressure is used as the means for moving the<br>
segmented-squeeze feet. For this invention, however, other actuators, such<br>
6<br>
 <br>
as a plurality of cylinders driven by air pressure or electrically powered<br>
actuators, can be used. If the electrically powered actuators are used as the<br>
means for moving the segmented-squeeze feet, no big piping would be<br>
required and molding speed can be increased since it would be possible to<br>
define the molding space and to squeeze the molding sand while the<br>
squeezing mechanism 9 is rotating.<br>
[0016]<br>
The sand-supplying mechanism 11 is disposed at the upper-left side<br>
portion of the base 1. The sand-supplying mechanism 11 has two means for<br>
fluidizing molding sand by the compressed air, which means are disposed at<br>
its lower portion and near sand-filling ports for supplying the molding sand.<br>
When the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 are filled with the molding sand,<br>
the molding sand is projected through the sand-filling ports by compressed<br>
air supplied above the molding sand while the compressed air injected<br>
the two sand fluidizing means is fluidizing the molding sand. The<br>
preferable pressure of the compressed air injected from the two means for<br>
fluidizing molding sand is 0.05 Mpa -0.18 Mpa. The two means for<br>
fluidizing molding sand can be driven simultaneously or based on the same<br>
control signal, instead of being driven independently.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the stripping mechanism 12, a stripping plate 28, which is<br>
insertable into the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 that are stacked and<br>
positioned in the horizontal state, is connected to the lower end of the piston<br>
rod of a downwardly-facing cylinder 29 which is fixed to the top portion of the<br>
base 1. The stripping plate 28 can ascend and descend by the extending and<br>
contracting motion of the cylinder 29. Further, a receiving device 30 for<br>
supporting an upper and a lower mold that are stripped from the cope flask 2<br>
and the drag flask 3 is disposed just below the stripping plate 28. The<br>
receiving member 30 is provided with an ascending and descending table 42<br>
that can ascend and descend by a pantograph that is driven by the extending<br>
and contracting motion of the cylinder 31 and a table 44 for supporting molds,<br>
which table 44 can ascend and descend by the extending and contracting<br>
motion of the cylinder 43. The table 44 is disposed on the ascending and<br>
descending table 42. The use of the pantograph 32 allows the apparatus to<br>
dispense with a pit under the pantograph 32 (see Figs. 3 and 4). Further,<br>
the pantograph 32 can be applied to the stripping mechanism 12 in order to<br>
7<br>
 <br>
downsize the molding apparatus.<br>
[0018]<br>
In a swiveling mechanism 13 to swivel the flasks, a rotating shaft 33,<br>
which perpendicularly extends and can rotate around its axis, is disposed at<br>
the base 1. The upper end of the rotating shaft 33 is connected to an output<br>
shaft of a motor 34 disposed at the top portion of the base 1. The rotating<br>
shaft 33 can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise for the range of 180<br>
degree by driving the motor 34. A supporting member 35 is disposed at an<br>
upper portion of the rotating shaft 33. Two pairs of guide rods 36, which<br>
pair is comprised of two rods 36 that are disposed at the front and rear side<br>
of the rotating shaft 33 with a predetermined interval therebetween and<br>
extend downwardly, are fixed to the supporting member 35 so that the rods<br>
36	are suspended from the supporting member 35. The two pairs of the<br>
guide rods 36 are opposed to each other and disposed at the right and the left<br>
side of the rotating shaft 33 so that the shaft 33 is located at the center of the<br>
pairs. Upper hooking members 37, which can hook the protuberances of the<br>
cope flasks 2, are mounted to each of the two pairs of the guide rods 36 and<br>
are sliderable upwardly and downwardly. The distal ends of the piston rods<br>
of upwardly-facing cylinders 38 that are disposed at the rotating shaft 33 are<br>
connected to the upper hooking members 37. The upper hooking members<br>
37	can ascend and descend by extending and contracting the cylinders 38.<br>
Further, lower hooking members 39, which can hook the protuberances of<br>
the two drag flasks 3, are mounted to each lower end of the two pairs of the<br>
guide rods 36. Also, a number 40, shown in the figures, denotes an<br>
apparatus for pushing out the upper and the lower mold from the table 44,<br>
which molds are stripped from the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3.<br>
[0019]<br>
Below, a method for producing a flaskless upper mold and a flaskless<br>
lower mold is explained, starting from the state shown in Fig. 1, wherein the<br>
method uses the flaskless molding apparatus explained in the above<br>
paragraphs. First, a match plate 5 is inserted between a pair of<br>
horizontally positioned cope flask 2 and drag flask 3 by a pair of arms 17 by<br>
extending the cylinder 16 of a conveying mechanism 4.<br>
[0020]<br>
Next, upper and lower lifting and lowering frames 20, 21 are made to<br>
move toward each other by contracting the upwardly-facing cylinders 22 and<br>
8<br>
 <br>
the downwardly-facing cylinder 23 of the squeezing mechanism 9.<br>
Simultaneously, the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 are made to move<br>
toward each other by lowering the upper hooking members 37 caused by the<br>
contraction of the cylinder 38. Then, while a match plate 5 is being held<br>
between the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3, a plurality of the upper and<br>
the lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a of an upper and a lower squeezing<br>
means 6, 7 are inserted into the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 respectively<br>
to define the upper and the lower molding space by extending the plurality of<br>
cylinders 24, 25 of the squeezing mechanism 9 for a predetermined length.<br>
Simultaneously, the pair of cope flask 2 and drag flask 3 and the match plate<br>
5 are rotated so as to become perpendicular by rotating the squeezing<br>
mechanism 9 clockwise about the supporting shaft 8 by extending the<br>
cylinder 10. Also, the sand-filling ports of the cope flask 2 and the drag<br>
flask 3 are moved upwardly and are communicated with the lower ends of<br>
the sand-supplying mechanism 11 respectively (see Fig. 5 (a)). During the<br>
clockwise rotation of the squeezing mechanism 9, the plurality of upper and<br>
lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a of the upper and the lower squeezing<br>
means 6, 7 are inserted into the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 for a<br>
predetermined length respectively by extending the plurality of cylinders 24,<br>
25 of the squeezing mechanism 9.<br>
[0021]<br>
Next, the intervals between the surfaces of the patterns of the match<br>
plate 5 and the plurality of upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a<br>
opposed to the match plate 5 are adjusted by extending the plurality of<br>
cylinders 6b, 7b of the upper and lower squeezing means 6, 7 for a<br>
predetermined length so that the ratio of the intervals before squeezing to<br>
the ratio after squeezing become almost equal. Namely, when the intervals<br>
between the surfaces of the patterns of the match plate 5 and the plurality of<br>
upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a opposed to the match plate 5<br>
before squeezing molding sand are defined as "A" and "B" respectively as<br>
shown in Fig. 5(b), and those after squeezing molding sand are defined as "a"<br>
and "b" respectively as shown in Fig. 5(c), the intervals are adjusted so that<br>
the ratios of "a/A" and "b/B" become near the relationship of "a/A=b/B." In<br>
other words, at the part where the surface of the pattern is higher than other<br>
parts, the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a are extended<br>
so that the quantity of the molding sand to be compressed decreases. In<br>
9<br>
 <br>
contrast, at the part where the surface of the pattern is lower than other<br>
parts, the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a are kept still so<br>
that the quantity of the molding sand to be compressed increases.<br>
[0022]<br>
Then, the upper and the lower molding spaces are filled with the<br>
molding sand by the sand-supplying mechanism 11 through the sand-filling<br>
ports of the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3. Next, while the pair of the<br>
cope flask 2, the drag flask 3 and the match plate 5 are being rotated from<br>
the perpendicular state to the horizontal state, the molding sand in the<br>
upper and the lower molding space is squeezed by moving the plurality of<br>
upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a further forwardly by<br>
extending the plurality of cylinders 24, 25. Then, after the plurality of<br>
upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a that are projected forwardly<br>
are moved backwardiy by contracting the plurality of cylinders 6b, 7b, the<br>
plurality of upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a are moved<br>
forwardly by further extending the plurality of cylinders 24, 25. As a result<br>
of these processes, the density of the molding sand of the molded upper and<br>
lower molds becomes substantially uniform. Also, the surfaces of the upper<br>
and the lower molds that face the upper and the lower segmented-squeeze<br>
feet 6a, 7a of an upper and a lower squeezing means become substantially<br>
flat. (See Fig. 5(c).)<br>
[0023]<br>
Next, the upper and the lower lifting and lowering frame 20, 21 are<br>
moved apart from each other by extending the upwardly-facing cylinder 22<br>
and the downwardly-facing cylinder 23. Then, the cope flask 2, which<br>
contains the mold formed by squeezing the molding sand, is lifted via the<br>
upper hooking members 37 by extending the cylinder 38 of the swiveling<br>
mechanism 13 and is separated from the match plate 5. The drag flask 3 is<br>
placed on the lower hooking members 39 of the swiveling mechanism 13.<br>
Next, the match plate 5 is transferred from between the cope flask 2 and the<br>
drag flask 3 by the pair of arms 17 put in action by contracting the cylinder<br>
16. Then, the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3, which contain the molded<br>
molds, are swiveled and moved to the position of the stripping mechanism 12<br>
by rotating the rotating shaft 33 for a predetermined angle by driving the<br>
motor 34 of the swiveling mechanism 13. Next, after setting a core in the<br>
mold if it is necessary, the cope flask, which contains the molded mold, is<br>
10<br>
 <br>
lowered via the upper hooking members 37 lowered by contracting the<br>
cylinders 38 and is stacked on the drag flask 3.<br>
[0024]<br>
Next, by lifting the table 44 for supporting molds by extending the<br>
cylinder 43 of the receiving member 30, and by further lifting it through the<br>
ascending and descending table 42 by extending the cylinder 31, the cope<br>
flask 2 and the drag flask 3, which contain the molded molds, are placed on<br>
the table 44. Then, after the stripping plate 28 is abutted on the upper<br>
surface of the mold in the cope flask 2 by extending the cylinder 29, the<br>
upper and the lower mold are stripped from the cope flask 2 and the drag<br>
flask 3 by simultaneously lowering the stripping plate 28 and the table 44 by<br>
extending and contracting the cylinders 29 and 43 respectively. Next, the<br>
upper and the lower mold are further lowered through the ascending and<br>
descending table 42 and the table 44 by contracting the cylinder 31. Then,<br>
the apparatus 40 for pushing out molds pushes out the upper and the lower<br>
molds on the table 44.<br>
[0025]<br>
In the process explained above, before the cope flask 2 and the drag<br>
flask 3, which contain the molded molds, are swiveled and moved to the<br>
position of the stripping mechanism 12, the core may be set in the molds that<br>
have been already molded if it is necessary, and then, in the same way as<br>
explained above, the pair of the cope flask 2 and the drag flask 3 are stacked,<br>
and then the molds are stripped from these flasks.<br>
[0026]<br>
For the preferred embodiment explained above, when the intervals<br>
between the surfaces of the patterns of the match plate 5 and the plurality of<br>
upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a of an upper and a lower<br>
squeezing means 6, 7 opposed to the match plate 5 before squeezing molding<br>
sand are defined as "A" and "B" respectively, and those after squeezing<br>
molding sand are defined as "a" and "b" respectively, the locations of the<br>
upper and the lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a are adjusted so that the<br>
ratios of "a/A" and "b/B" become close to the relationship of "a/A=b/B."<br>
However, this invention is not limited to this method. In this invention, the<br>
any method that can produce the molds having a substantially uniform<br>
density of the molding sand after squeezing it, can be used based on the<br>
concept that the positions of a plurality of upper and lower<br>
11<br>
 <br>
segmented-squeeze feet, which determine the state of the molding sand filled<br>
in the molding spaces, are controlled according to the intervals between the<br>
surfaces of patterns of a match plate and the surfaces of a plurality of upper<br>
and lower segmented-squeeze feet opposed to the match plate.<br>
[0027]<br>
For example, as shown in Fig. 7(a) -7(f), after an upper and a lower<br>
molding space are defined by a match plate 5, a cope flask 2 and a drag flask<br>
3, and an upper and a lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a of an upper and a<br>
lower squeezing means 6, 7 at the perpendicular position, the molding spaces<br>
are filled with molding sand through the sand-filling ports of the cope flask 2<br>
and the drag flask 3. Then, the molding sand in the upper and the lower<br>
molding spaces is squeezed by forwardly moving the plurality of upper and<br>
lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a driven by extending each of the<br>
plurality of cylinders 6b, 7b. Next, once the plurality of upper and lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a are moved backwardly by contracting the<br>
plurality of cylinders 6b, 7b. Then, the upper and the lower molding spaces<br>
are further filled with molding sand through the sand-filling ports. After<br>
the squeezing surfaces of the plurality of upper and lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a are uniformly positioned on a plane, the<br>
molding sand in the upper and lower molding spaces may be further<br>
squeezed by moving forwardly in unison the plurality of upper and lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a, driven by extending the plurality of cylinders<br>
24,25.<br>
[0028]<br>
Here, for the plurality of upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a,<br>
7a, it is possible to make two or more of the upper and the lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet integrated.<br>
[0029]<br>
As shown in Figs. 6(a) -6(c), for the purpose of improving fiowability<br>
of molding sand between the pattern of the match plate 5 and the plurality of<br>
upper and lower segmented-squeeze feet 6a, 7a of the upper and the lower<br>
squeezing means 6, 7 opposed to the match plate 5, slanted surfaces 51 are<br>
formed on the part of the plurality of lower segmented-squeeze feet. Here,<br>
although the slanted surfaces 51 are formed only on the lower<br>
segmented-squeeze feet, they may be formed on the part of the plurality of<br>
upper segmented-squeeze feet or on the part of each of the plurality of upper<br>
12<br>
 <br>
and lower segmented-squeeze feet.<br>
[0030]<br>
Further, the molding apparatus of this invention may have an air<br>
relief mechanism on the match plate 5 so that a portion of the bottom of the<br>
molding space, behind the corners of the pattern of the match plate 5 can be<br>
completely filled with the molding sand.<br>
[0031]<br>
Next, for the flaskless molding apparatus for molds explained in the<br>
above paragraphs, a procedure for changing a match plate 5 is explained<br>
below. First, as shown in Fig. 8(a), cope flasks 2, 2 are hooked by lifting<br>
upper hooking members 37, 37, which are lifted by extending cylinders 38,<br>
38 of a swiveling mechanism 13. Then, a carrier plate 45 having the match<br>
plate 5 (A) is transferred from rails 46 to rails 47 of the cope flask 2 by<br>
rotating a pair of arms 17 counterclockwise which rotation is caused by-<br>
extending a cylinder 16 of a conveying mechanism 4. Then the match plate<br>
5(A) is placed below the left cope flask 2. Next, as shown in Fig. 8(b), while<br>
the cope flask 2 is slightly being lifted and lowered by extending and<br>
contracting the cylinders 38, the pair of the arms 17 is disconnected from the<br>
carrier plate 45 by rotating the pair of the arms 17 clockwise, which rotation<br>
is caused by contracting the cylinder 16 of the conveying mechanism 4.<br>
Then, the pair of arms 17 are returned to the initial position. The carrier<br>
plate 45 having a match plate 5 (B) to be substituted is suspended from rails<br>
disposed on a suitable transferring device and is ready and waiting at the<br>
side of the stripping mechanism 12. The carrier plate is moved to the<br>
position opposed to the rails 47 of the right cope flask 2 placed at the<br>
stripping mechanism 12.<br>
[0032]<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 9(a), the carrier plate 45, which is placed at<br>
the position opposed to the rails 47 of the right cope flask 2 placed at the<br>
stripping mechanism 12, is manually transferred onto the rails 47 of the<br>
right cope flask 2. As a result of this operation, the right match plate 5(B) is<br>
placed below the right cope flask 2. Then, as shown Fig. 9(b), the swiveling<br>
mechanism 13 is rotated by driving a motor 34, and the left match plate 5(A)<br>
placed at the squeezing mechanism 9 is moved to the stripping mechanism<br>
12, and the right match plate 5(B) placed at the stripping mechanism 12 is<br>
moved to the squeezing mechanism 9.<br>
13<br>
 <br>
[0033]<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 10(a), while the left cope flask 2 is slightly<br>
being lifted and lowered by extending and contracting the cylinders 38, the<br>
pair of arms 17 is connected to the carrier plate 45 having the match plate<br>
5(B) by rotating the pair of the arms 17 counterclockwise, which rotation is<br>
caused by extending the cylinder 16 of the conveying mechanism 4.<br>
Simultaneously, the carrier plate 45 having the match plate 5(A) is moved<br>
from the rails 47 of the right cope flask 2 onto the rails of the suitable<br>
transferring device. Next, as shown in Fig. 10(b), the carrier plate 45<br>
having the match plate 5(B) is moved from the rails 47 of the left cope flask 2<br>
onto the rails 46 by rotating the pair of the arms 17 clockwise, which rotation<br>
is caused by contracting the cylinder 16 of the conveying mechanism 4. As<br>
the result of this operation, the match plate 5(B) is transferred from the cope<br>
flask 2. Further, the carrier plate 45 having the match plate 5(A), placed at<br>
the suitable transferring device, are moved to a suitable place by moving a<br>
suitable transferring device. By these operations explained above, the<br>
procedure for changing a match plate is completed.<br>
[0034]<br>
For this embodiment, to handle two pairs of cope flask and drag flask,<br>
the apparatus is comprised of:<br>
a stripping mechanism to strip an upper and a lower mold from the<br>
pair of cope flask and drag flask, which have already been subjected to<br>
squeezing operation, are stacked, horizontally positioned, and contain the<br>
