				<td>GLASS YARNS SUITABLE FOR REINFORCING ORGANIC AND/OR<br>
INORGANIC MATERIALS<br>
The invention relates to glass yarns suitable for reinforcing organic and/or<br>
inorganic materials. It also relates to the glass composition suitable for<br>
manufacturing such glass yarns and the composites based on such materials<br>
reinforced by said yarns.<br>
The field of reinforcing glass yarns is a very particular field of the glass<br>
industry. These yarns are obtained by the method that consists in mechanically<br>
drawing threads of molten glass flowing through orifices arranged at the base of<br>
a die generally heated by Joule effect.<br>
The yarns are produced from specific glass compositions for obtaining<br>
filaments having a diameter of a few microns and for the formation of<br>
continuous yarns suitable for performing the reinforcing function in organic<br>
and/or inorganic materials in order to impart better mechanical properties<br>
thereto. The reinforcing glass yarns are used as such or in the form of<br>
organized assemblies such as fabrics.<br>
The mechanical properties of these reinforced materials are mainly<br>
governed by the composition of the glass constituting the reinforcing yarns. The<br>
most commonly known glasses for this use are "E" type glasses having the<br>
composition SiO2-AI2O3-CaO of which the archetype is described in patents US-<br>
A-2 334 981 and US-A-2 571 074 and which have a composition essentially<br>
based on silica, alumina, lime and boric anhydride. The latter component,<br>
present in a content of between 5 and 13 %, is added to replace silica, and it<br>
serves to draw the E glass under highly advantageous conditions, particularly<br>
with a relatively low working temperature, of about 1200°C, a liquidus<br>
temperature about 120°C lower than the working temperature, and a low<br>
devitrification rate.<br>
In the context of the present invention, "working temperature" means the<br>
temperature at which the glass has a viscosity of 1000 poises (denoted Tlog3).<br>
In the context of the present invention, "liquidus temperature" (denoted Tljq)<br>
means the temperature at which the most refractory phase, which may devitrify<br>
in the glass, has a zero growth and thus corresponds to the melting point of this<br>
devitrified phase. The liquidus temperature gives the lower temperature limit at<br>
which the glass can be drawn.<br>
The "drawing range", denoted AT, which corresponds to the difference<br>
between the working temperature and the liquidus temperature, is a criterion for<br>
measuring the aptitude of a molten glass composition to crystallize. In general,<br>
the risk of devitrification during the drawing of the filaments is avoided when the<br>
drawing range AT is positive, preferably above 50°C.<br>
The composition of E glass defined in standard ASTM D 578-98 is the<br>
following (in weight percent): 52 to 56 % SiO2; 12 to 16 % AI2O3; 16 to 25 %<br>
CaO; 5 to 10 % B2O3; 0 to 5 % MgO; 0 to 2 % Na2O + K2O; 0 to 0.8 % TiO2;<br>
0.05 to 0.4 % Fe2O3; 0 to 1 % F2.<br>
Boric anhydride B2O3, and fluorine F2, play the role of a flux in the glass<br>
batch, which, as already mentioned, and thereby allow the glass to be drawn<br>
under better conditions. However, these components have the drawback of<br>
being volatile and of generating emissions of boron and fluorine which must<br>
necessarily be treated in pollution control installations before being released<br>
into the atmosphere. The implementation of this treatment incurs a high extra<br>
cost of the glass yarns. Furthermore, the raw materials from which these<br>
components are obtained, in particular B2O3, which must account for at least 5<br>
% by weight of the glass, are relatively expensive.<br>
Standard ASTM D 578-98 provides for other reinforcing yarns of E glass<br>
which may not contain boron. These yarns have the following composition (in<br>
weight percent): 52 to 62 % SiO2; 12 to 16 % Al2O3; 16 to 25 % CaO; 0 to 10 %<br>
B2O3; 0 to 5 % MgO; 0 to 2 % Na2O + K2O; 0 to 1.5 % TiO2; 0.05 to 0.8 %<br>
Fe2O3; 0 to 1 % F2.<br>
Numerous particular glass compositions meeting the latter standard have<br>
been proposed.<br>
Thus, US-A-3 847 626 describes a glass composition in which B2O3 and<br>
F2 are replaced by high contents of TiO2 (3 to 5 %) and of MgO (1.5 to 4 %).<br>
Although the two oxides serve to compensate for the absence of boron and<br>
fluorine while allowing the drawing, on the other hand, the glass formed has a<br>
yellow color due to the TiO2, which tends to make it unfit for certain applications.<br>
A high TiO2 content (2 to 4 %) is also recommended in US-A-4 026 715,<br>
combined with divalent oxides such as SrO, ZnO or BaO, which nevertheless<br>
have the drawback of being expensive.<br>
US-A-4 199 364 describes compositions comprising a high lithium oxide<br>
content. Apart from its high cost, this compound forms part of the alkali oxides<br>
known to degrade the fitness of the fibers for the reinforcement of electronic<br>
circuit supports.<br>
Application WO 96/39362 describes compositions without boron, and<br>
possibly without fluorine, formed essentially from the quaternary system SiO2<br>
AI2O3-CaO-MgO, containing a small quantity of TiO2 (less than 0.9 %) and<br>
generally free of costly oxides such as those described in the abovementioned<br>
applications. The liquidus temperature and the working temperature of these<br>
glasses are nevertheless relatively high.<br>
More recently, several attempts have been made to obtain low cost<br>
glasses whose drawing conditions approach those of E glass containing boron.<br>
Thus, WO 99/12858 and WO 99/01393 describe glass compositions<br>
containing small quantities of B2O3 or F2.<br>
In WO 00/73232, the drop in the characteristic temperatures is obtained<br>
thanks to glass compositions combining a low MgO content (less than 1 %) and<br>
the addition of a certain quantity of boron oxide, lithium oxide, zinc oxide, or<br>
manganese oxide, thereby reducing the economic advantage of these<br>
compositions. In WO 00/73231, the liquidus temperature is lowered, in<br>
particular thanks to the addition of MgO in a narrow proportion, between 1.7 and<br>
2.6 %, which in most of the compositions exemplified is combined with an oxide<br>
selected from boron oxide, lithium oxide, zinc oxide and manganese oxide.<br>
A decrease in the characteristic drawing temperatures is also obtained, in<br>
WO 01/32576, by a glass composition containing a low silica content (less than<br>
58 %), and in US 2003/0224922 by the selection of glass compositions having a<br>
weight ratio of silica to the sum of alkaline-earth oxides that is lower than 2.35.<br>
It is found that the producers of yarns of E glass according to the<br>
abovementioned ASTM standard D 578-98 have had the constant concern of<br>
lowering the cost of the glass composition by decreasing the content of the<br>
most expensive components, which are boron and fluorine, while preserving a<br>
good aptitude of the glass for drawing, a low level of pollutant emissions, and<br>
properties compatible with use as reinforcement of organic and/or inorganic<br>
materials.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide yarns consisting of a<br>
glass having a different composition from that of E glass, which have a level of<br>
performance, particularly in terms of mechanical properties and hydrolytic<br>
resistance, comparable to E glass, at a lower cost.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention thanks to the glass<br>
yarns having a lower alumina content, of which the composition comprises the<br>
following components within the limits defined below expressed in weight<br>
percent:<br>
<br>
Silica SiO2 is one of the oxides forming the glass lattice according to the<br>
invention and plays an essential role for their stability. In the context of the<br>
invention, when the silica content is lower than 62 %, the glass obtained is not<br>
viscous enough and devitrifies too easily during the drawing. Above 72 %, the<br>
glass becomes highly viscous and difficult to melt. Preferably, the silica content<br>
is between 63 and 71 %.<br>
Alumina Al2O3 also constitutes one of the oxides forming the glass lattice<br>
according to the invention and plays an essential role with regard to stability.<br>
The alumina content is limited to 11 %, preferably 10 %, essentially to reduce<br>
the final cost of the glass. An alumina content lower than 4 % causes a<br>
significant increase in hydrolytic attack of the glass and a decrease in the<br>
Young's modulus of the glass. Preferably, the alumina content is equal to or<br>
higher than 6 %, and even better equal to or higher than 7 %.<br>
Advantageously, the sum of the silica and alumina contents is above 72<br>
%, preferably above 73 %, which serves to obtain advantageous values of<br>
hydrolytic resistance. Preferably, the sum of the silica and alumina contents is<br>
equal to or lower than 77 %.<br>
The CaO content serves to adjust the viscosity and to control the<br>
devitrification of the glasses. In the context of the limits defined according to the<br>
invention, a CaO content above 22 % increases the rate of devitrification to<br>
Ca.SiO3 (wollastonite) which is detrimental to good drawing. A content lower<br>
than 8 % unacceptably decreases the hydrolytic resistance of the glass.<br>
Preferably, the CaO content is equal to or higher than 12 %, and<br>
advantageously lower than 19 %.<br>
Magnesia MgO, in combination with CaO, serves to lower the liquidus<br>
temperature of the glass. The addition of MgO in the content indicated serves<br>
to introduce a competition between the growth of the wollastonite crystals and<br>
the growth of the dioxide crystals (CaO.Mg0.2SiO2), having the effect of<br>
slowing the growth of these two types of crystals and finally imparting better<br>
devitrification resistance to the glass. Furthermore, MgO contributes to<br>
obtaining a high hydrolytic resistance. The MgO content varies between 1 and<br>
7 %, preferably between 3 and 5 %.<br>
BaO and SrO may be present in the glass composition in a total content<br>
lower than 4 %, preferably lower than 2 %, to avoid increasing the cost and<br>
density of the glass (which has the effect of lowering the specific Young's<br>
modulus). In general, the composition contains no BaO or SrO.<br>
The alkali oxides, Na2O, K2O and Li2O, may be introduced into the<br>
composition according to the invention to contribute to limit the devitrification<br>
and reduce the viscosity of the glass. The alkali oxide content must<br>
nevertheless remain lower than or equal to 9 % to avoid degrading the<br>
hydrolytic resistance of the glass and to maintain the mechanical properties of<br>
the yarn at an acceptable level. The alkali oxide content is preferably lower<br>
than 7 %, and in particular higher than 1 %.<br>
According to a first embodiment, the Na2O content is equal to or higher<br>
than 3 %, preferably lower than or equal to 7 % and even better lower than 6 %,<br>
the K2O content is lower than or equal to 1 %, preferably lower than or equal to<br>
0.5 % and even better lower than or equal to 0.3 %, and the Li2O content is<br>
lower than 1 % and preferably zero.<br>
According to a second embodiment, the Na2O content varies between 2<br>
and 4 %, and is preferably about 3 %, the K2O content also varies within the<br>
same limits, and the Li2O content is lower than 1 % and preferably zero.<br>
Boron oxide B2O3 plays a role of fluidizer. Its content in the glass<br>
composition according to the invention is limited to 4 %, preferably lower than or<br>
equal to 2 %, to avoid problems of volatilization and pollutant emission, and to<br>
avoid significantly increasing the cost of the composition. The boron may be<br>
incorporated as a raw material in the form of glass yarn waste containing boron,<br>
in particular E glass. In general, the compositions according to the invention<br>
contain no B2O3.<br>
Fluorine may be added in small quantities to improve the melting of the<br>
glass, or may be present as an impurity issuing from the vitrifiable raw<br>
materials, but without exceeding 2 %. Preferably, the fluorine content is lower<br>
than 1 % because a higher level may incur risks of pollutant emissions and<br>
corrosion of the furnace refractories. In general, the compositions according to<br>
the invention contain no fluorine.<br>
The components TiO2, ZrO2, Fe2O3 (total iron), P2O5, MnO, Cr2O3,<br>
MoO3, ZnO and SO3 may be present in the glass composition in a total content<br>
of not more than 4 %, preferably not more than 2 %.<br>
Preferably, these components are present in the following contents:<br>
<br>
The glass yarns according to the invention are obtained from the glass<br>
composition previously described according to the following method: a<br>
multiplicity of threads of molten glass are drawn, in the form of one or more<br>
sheets of continuous yarns, the filaments are gathered into one or more yarns<br>
which are collected on a moving support. This may be a rotating support when<br>
the yarns are collected in the form of windings or a translational support when<br>
the yarns are cut by a member also serving to draw them or when the yarns are<br>
projected by a member serving to draw them in such a way as to form a mat.<br>
The yarns obtained generally comprise filaments having a diameter of 5 to<br>
30 microns, and their linear density may vary to a large extent.<br>
These yarns may undergo processing operations, for example in order to<br>
"bulk" them, to impart a twist or to join them to form yarns having an even higher<br>
linear density. The yarns may thus be in different forms: continuous or cut<br>
yarns, meshes, fabrics, knits, braids, ribbons or mats. Preferably, the yarns are<br>
joined in structures having the shape of meshes, fabrics and mats.<br>
The yarns having a filament diameter lower than or equal to 11 microns<br>
and a linear density lower than or equal to 200 Tex are suitable more<br>
particularly for textile applications. These yarns are advantageously twisted<br>
and/or stranded and coated with a specific size enabling them to withstand<br>
weaving operations.<br>
Yarns having higher diameter and linear density, preferably without twist,<br>
are more particularly suitable for reinforcing plastics.<br>
The glass melt supplied to the dies is obtained from pure raw materials (for<br>
example from the chemical industry) or more generally from natural materials<br>
(the latter sometimes containing trace impurities), these raw materials being<br>
mixed in suitable proportions to obtain the desired composition, and then being<br>
melted. The glass melt temperature (and therefore its viscosity) is<br>
conventionally adjusted in order to permit drawing while avoiding problems of<br>
devitrification. Before being joined in the form of yarns, the filaments are<br>
generally coated with a size composition designed to protect them from<br>
abrasion and facilitate their subsequent combination with the materials to be<br>
reinforced.<br>
Optionally, the glass yarns according to the invention may be combined<br>
with organic filaments, for example during drawing, to form composite yarns.<br>
The composites obtained from the yarns according to the invention<br>
comprise at least one organic material and/or at least one inorganic material<br>
and glass yarns, at least part of the yarns being yarns according to the<br>
invention. These composites have good mechanical properties and hydrolytic<br>
resistance.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention but without limiting<br>
it.<br>
a) production of bulk glasses<br>
Glasses are prepared having the composition appearing in Table 1,<br>
expressed in weight percent.<br>
Examples 1 to 9 illustrate the glasses according to the invention; examples<br>
C1 and C2 are comparative examples: C1 is a boron-free glass described in<br>
application WO-A-96/39362 and C2 is a standard E glass containing boron.<br>
Table 1 shows the following:<br>
&gt; the working temperature Tlog3 corresponding to the temperature at<br>
which the viscosity of the glass is equal to 103 poises,<br>
&gt; the liquidus temperature Tliqu corresponding to the temperature at<br>
which the most refractory phase, which can devitrify in the glass, has<br>
a zero growth rate and thereby corresponds to the melting point of<br>
this devitrified phase,<br>
&gt; the drawing range AT corresponds to the difference in temperatures<br>
between Tlog3 and Tliq,<br>
&gt; the Littleton point Tlog7.6 corresponding to this temperature at which<br>
the viscosity of the glass is equal to 107.6 poises. This temperature is<br>
an indicator for estimating the fire resistance of the glass, and hence<br>
of the composites containing same,<br>
&gt; the value of the specific Young's modulus of the bulk glass which<br>
corresponds to the ratio of the Young's modulus measured according<br>
to standard ASTM C 1259-01 and the density of the glass sample<br>
measured by the Archimedes method. A good correlation exists<br>
between the specific Young's modulus measured on the mass glass<br>
and the specific Young's modulus of the yarn comprising filaments of<br>
the same glass; in consequence, the values in Table 1 provide an<br>
estimate of the mechanical properties in terms of modulus of the<br>
glass after drawing,<br>
&gt; the hydrolytic resistance, evaluated by the "DGG" method (Deutsche<br>
Glastechniche Gesellschaft after Fisher and Fischer and Tepoel;<br>
Glastech. Ber.; vol. VI, p. 522; 1928) which consists in measuring the<br>
attack of the glass by water. For this purpose, 10 g of ground glass<br>
(grain size 360-400 urn) is immersed in 100 ml of water and 98°C for<br>
five hours. After rapid cooling, the solution is filtered. The mass of<br>
dry residue is measured on the filtrate, expressed as mg/10 g of<br>
glass and the alkalinity corresponding to the mass of alkali is<br>
determined by titration with hydrochloric acid, expressed in mg<br>
equivalent Na2O/10 g of glass .<br>
It appears that the examples according to the invention offer an excellent<br>
compromise between the melting and drawing properties, the mechanical<br>
properties and the hydrolytic resistance.<br>
In the examples according to the invention, the working temperature<br>
remains acceptable even though it is higher than the examples C1 and C2, and<br>
the drawing range is at least equal to about 50°C, and may be up to 93°C<br>
(example 1).<br>
The specific Young's modulus of the examples according to the invention,<br>
in particular example 4, is substantially equivalent to that of the examples C1<br>
and C2.<br>
The hydrolytic resistance of examples 1 and 8 is comparable to that of<br>
examples C1 and C2, and that of example 9 is better.<br>
The glasses of examples 4 to 6 have a Littleton point higher than that of E<br>
glass with boron (example C2), and in consequence better fire resistance.<br>
b) production of glass yarns<br>
Glass yarns (filament diameter: 17um; linear density: 235 Tex) are<br>
obtained in a conventional drawing installation from the glasses of examples 4,<br>
7 and C2.<br>
The unit tensile strength, measured in the conditions of standard ISO<br>
3341, is given in Table 2 below.<br>
The breakage rate of yarns obtained from the glasses of examples 4 and 7<br>
according to the invention is similar to that of the glass yarns of example C2.<br>
