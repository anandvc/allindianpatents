				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a process for the preparation of barium titanate based composition with high dielectric constant and temperature stability. The invention also relates to a composition having high dielectric constant and temperature stability.<br>
This invention particularly relates to improved barium titanate based composition which is lead and boron free, showing high dielectric constant value and temperature stability over a wide range and are useful for making low-fire multilayer ceramic capacitors.<br>
The uniqueness of the present invention lies in the fact that i) the improved composition eliminates the necessity of any hazardous lead compound in the powder mix, whereas similar existing compositions contain toxic lead compounds and ii) the improved composition eliminates the necessity of any boron compound in the powder mix and hence environment-friendly water based binders can be used during fabrication of the capacitors from the powder mix.<br>
Various dielectric compositions standardized and coded have got typical applications. Low-fire high dielectric constant: capacitor compositions showing temperature stability within a specific range (variation of capacitance between + 10°C to + 85°C should be within + 20 to - 56% of room temperature value) are generally coded as Z5U type. They offer very high capacitance per unit volume and are particularly preferred for decoupling and filtering applications. These capacitors show relatively wide variations of capacitance with temperture than those of X7R type capacitors (for which the capacitance value between - 55°C<br><br>
and +  125°C  should not  change  over +/-   15%).<br>
In this connection, reference may be made to the following publications and patents:<br>
1.	TAM  Ceramics   Inc.,   Niagara  Falls,   New  York,   Product   Data<br>
Sheet,   Product  no.   52604,   Grade  Z5U,   502L.<br>
2.	I.Burn   "Flux-sintered BaTi03   dielectrics"   J.   Mat.Sc.   1398<br>
(1982)<br>
3.	G.G.Mahar,   U.S.Patent  no.   4,066,426    (1978)<br>
4.	D.A.Payne  and  S.M.Park,   U.S.Patent  no.   4,218,723    (1980)<br>
All   of   the   above  works   are  based  on modification  of  pure BaTi03  by suitable  doping.   However,   all  of  them use  either highly toxic  lead compounds  or binder  incompatible   (water based)   boron compounds  or both.<br>
The  main  object   of   the   present   invention   is   to   provide a  composition  having  high  dielectric   constant   and  temperature stability   useful    for   making   low-fire   multilayer   ceramic capacitors  which obviates  the drawbacks  as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved barium titanate ( BaTiO-j) based composition which is free of toxic lead and problematic boron compounds.<br>
Yet another object is to provide lead and boron free barium titanate based dielectric compositions showing room temperture (~30°C) dielectric constant values ranging from 5500 to 7500 (in the disc form) and dissipation factors 0.04 to 0.01 (at 1kHz and IV RMS).<br>
Still   another   object   is   to  provide   lead   and  boron   free<br><br>
barium titanate based dielectric compositions showing dielectric constant variations ( from its room temperature value ) over the temperature range + 10°C to + 85°C within + 15 to -55%.<br>
Yet another object is to provide lead and boron free barium titanate based dielectric compositions which can be sintered at 
Another object is to provide a process for preparing a powder mix of the composition of the present invention.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a composition having high dielectric constant and temperature stability useful for making low-fire ceramic capacitors which comprises:<br>
(i)  barium titanate (BaTi03) ;<br>
(ii) 0.3 - 1.5 wt.% (of BaTiO3) flux containing Li2C204, Bi203, and CuO;<br>
(iii) 0.3 - 9.0 wt. % (of BaTiO3) grain growth inhibitors and Curie peak suppressors containing CaZrO-,, Nb^O^ and BaC03.<br>
The flux used in the composition of the present invention may be of laboratory reagent grade and may consist of 0.5 - 1 wt.% Li2C204, 0.5 - 0.9 wt. % Bi203 and 0.1 - 0.3 wt. % CuO(of barium titanate).<br>
The grain growth inhibitors and Curie peak suppressors used in the composition of the present invention may be of laboratory reagent grade and may consist of 4-9 wt. % CaZr03, 0.3-1 wt. % Nb90c and 2.5-5 wt.% BaCO-, (of barium titanate).<br>
£,  O	-3  \	/<br>
The composition of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a synergistic mixture having properties which are different from the mere aggregated properties of the individual ingredients.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of barium titanate based composition with high dielectric constant and temperature stability which comprises:<br>
a)	adding 0.3 - 1.5 wt.% (of BaTiOa) fluxes containing I^CaCU, Bi2O3 and<br>
CuO in a ratio in the range of 1:1:0.2 to 1:1:0.3   to BaTiO3 powder,<br>
b)	adding 4.0 - 9.0 wt. % CaZrO3,0.3-1.0 wt % Nb2O5 and  2.5-5.0 wt %<br>
BaCOs to the mixture obtained in step a),  which acts as grain growth<br>
inhibitors and Curie peak suppressors,<br>
c)	mixing the said composition obtained in step b) in a ball mill with 60-<br>
80 wt.% ( of powder mix) distilled water for 10 - 20 h,<br>
d)	drying the mixture at 100 - 150°C in an oven for 2 - 4 h,<br>
e)	calcining the mixture at 600 - 800°C for 5 - 10 h and<br>
f)	dry grinding of the calcined powder in a ball mill for 5 - 10 h to obtain<br>
the product.<br>
