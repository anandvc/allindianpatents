				<td>Title: IRON-PHOSPHORUS ELECTROPLATING BATH AND METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to iron-phosphorus electroplating baths and to durable<br>
alloys electrodeposited from such baths.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Electroplated iron-phosphorus films generally have a higher hardness than<br>
electroplated iron films. Accordingly, it has been known to plate aluminum alloy<br>
pistons, cylinders, etc. with an iron phosphorus alloy to improve the abrasion<br>
resistance and galling resistance of these articles. Iron-phosphorus electroplating<br>
baths which have been known in the prior art generally comprise a ferrous ion, a<br>
hypophosphorus acid or a hypophosphite salt, and may contain other optional<br>
materials such as boric acid, aluminum chloride, ammonium chloride, complexing<br>
agents, etc. One of the difficulties associated with many of the iron-phosphorus<br>
electroplating baths described in the prior art is cracking of the deposited alloy and<br>
loss of adhesion to the substrate. The presence of cracks in the alloy results in<br>
reduced hardness and also tends to reduce the toughness of the alloy coated work<br>
piece. Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop an iron phosphorus electroplating<br>
bath which would produce alloy deposits which exhibit little or no cracking or loss<br>
of adhesion on annealing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, this invention relates to an aqueous acid iron phosphorus<br>
bath which comprises<br>
(A) at least one compound from which iron can be electrolytically<br>
deposited,<br>
(B) hypophosphite ion, and<br>
(C) a sulfur-containing compound selected from sulfoalkylated polyethylene<br>
imines, sulfonated safranin dye, and mercapto aliphatic sulfonic acids or alkali<br>
metal salts thereof.<br>
Optionally, the aqueous acidic iron phosphorus electroplating bath of the invention<br>
also may comprise aluminum ions.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for electrodepositing an ironphosphorus<br>
alloy on a conductive substrate which comprises<br>
(A) providing an aqueous acidic electroplating bath as described above,<br>
and<br>
(B) effecting the electro deposition of the alloy on the substrate through<br>
the use of said electroplating bath. The alloys which are deposited on the<br>
substrates by the process of the present invention are characterized by the<br>
presence of iron, phosphorus and sulfur.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to an aqueous acidic iron<br>
phosphorus bath comprising<br>
(A) at least one compound from which iron can be electrolytically<br>
deposited,<br>
(B) hypophosphite ion, and<br>
(C) a sulfur-containing compound selected from sulfoalkylated polyethylene<br>
imines, sulfonated safranin dye, and mercapto aliphatic sulfonic acids or alkali<br>
metal salts thereof.<br>
The source of iron in the electroplating bath can be any of those sources of<br>
iron known to the art such as ferrous sulfate, ferrous chloride, ferrous fluoroborate,<br>
ferrous sulfamate, ferrous methane sulfonate, and mixtures thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, the source of iron is a mixture of ferrous chloride and ferrous sulfate.<br>
The amount of ferrous ions in the plating baths should be in the range of from about<br>
20 grams to about 120 grams per liter or from about 0.5 molar to as high as the<br>
saturation limit for ferrous ion and the plating bath which may be up to about 2 molar<br>
ferrous iron. In another embodiment, the concentration of the ferrous ions in the<br>
plating bath is from about 20 to about 80 grams per liter of the bath.<br>
Hypophosphorous acid (H3PO2) and alkali metal hypophosphites are useful<br>
as sources of hypophosphite ions in the electroplating baths of the present<br>
invention. In one embodiment, the source of hypophosphite ion in the bath is a<br>
mixture of hypophosphorus acid and an alkali metal hypophosphite salt. Examples<br>
of useful hypophosphite salts include the sodium salt (NaH2PO2) the potassium salt<br>
(KH2PO2), etc. The concentrations of the hypophosphite ion in the plating bath of<br>
the present invention determines the amount of phosphorus in the iron-phosphorus<br>
alloy deposited from the plating bath. The amount of hypophosphorus acid or alkali<br>
metal hypophosphite salts contained in the bath may vary from about 0.01 to about<br>
15 grams per liter, and the amount of phosphorus contained in the plating baths of<br>
the present invention may range from about 0.2 to about 8 grams of phosphorus per<br>
liter of the plating bath. In another embodiment, the total of hypophosphite ion and<br>
hypophosphorus acid in the plating bath may be between about 0.005 and 0.1<br>
molar, and in yet another embodiment, from about 0.01 to about 0.07 molar. The<br>
particular amount of hypophosphorous acid and hypophosphite included in the<br>
electroplating bath varies with the desired phosphorus content of the deposited ironphosphorus<br>
alloys.<br>
As noted above, the aqueous acidic iron phosphorus baths of the present<br>
invention also contain a sulfur-containing compound selected from sulfoalkylated<br>
polyethylene imines and mercapto aliphatic sulfonic acids or alkali metal salts<br>
thereof. It has been discovered than when these sulfur-containing compounds, as<br>
described more fully below, are incorporated into the electroplating baths, superior<br>
iron-phosphorus alloys are deposited from the bath onto conductive substrates, and<br>
these improved alloys are obtainable with the electroplating baths of the present<br>
invention which may be free of complexing agents ordinarily utilized in prior art<br>
electroplating baths. In one embodiment, the mercapto aliphatic sulfonic acids and<br>
alkali metal salts may be represented by the formula<br>
Y-S-R1-S03X I<br>
wherein X is H or an alkali metal, R1 is an alkylene group containing from 1 to about<br>
5 carbon atoms Y is H, S-R1-S03X, C(S)NR2", C(S)OR" C(NH2)NR2", or a<br>
heterocyclic group, and each R" is independently H or an alkyl group containing<br>
from 1 to about 5 carbon atoms.<br>
In another embodiment R1 is H or an alkylenic group containing 1 to 3 carbon<br>
atoms and R" is H or a methyl group.<br>
A variety of useful mercapto aliphatic sulfonic acids and alkali metal salts<br>
thereof are available from Raschig. Specific examples include mercapto propyl<br>
sulfonic acid sodium salt (identified as MPS); bis-(sodium sulfopropyl)-disulfide<br>
(SPS); N,N-dimethyl-dithiocarbamyl propyl sulfonic acid, sodium salt (DPS); <br>
(benzothiazolyl-2-mercapto)-propyl sulfonic acid, sodium salt (ZPS); O-ethyl<br>
dithiocarbonato)-S-(3-sulfopropyl)-ester, potassium salt (OPX); 3-S-isothiuronium<br>
propyl sulfonate (UPS). The sulfur-containing compound added to the iron<br>
phosphorus electroplating baths of the invention also may be a sulfopropylated<br>
polyethylene imine available, for example, as an aqueous solution under the<br>
designation Leveller 135 CU from Raschig. Another used sulfur-containing<br>
compound is sulfonated safranin dye available, for example from Clariant.<br>
The amount of the sulfur-containing compound contained in the electroplating<br>
baths of the present invention may vary from about 0.001 to about 0.5 grams per<br>
liter of bath. In another embodiment, the amount of sulfur containing compound in<br>
the electroplating bath may range from about 0.01 to about 0.1 gram per liter of<br>
bath.<br>
In another embodiment, the electroplating baths of the invention may also<br>
comprise aluminum ions. Examples of aluminum ion sources which may be<br>
included in electroplating baths include aluminum sulfate, aluminum chloride, etc.<br>
The amount of aluminum ion which may be present in the plating baths of the<br>
invention may range from about 0.1 to about 10 grams per liter of bath. In another<br>
embodiment, the electroplating baths may contain from about 1 to about 5 grams<br>
per liter of aluminum ions.<br>
The electroplating baths of the present invention may contain compounds<br>
which act as complexing agents and/or stabilizers. However, one of the characteristics<br>
of the plating baths of this invention is that alloy deposits having excellent<br>
properties can be obtained without any stabilizers or complexing agents in the baths.<br>
In some instances, stabilizers and complexing agents known in the art may be<br>
included in the baths. Examples of such compounds include glycine, B-alanine, DLalanine,<br>
succinic acid, L-ascorbic acid, gluconic acid, oxalic acid, etc.<br>
The plating baths of the present invention may further contain one or more<br>
water-insoluble materials selected from metals, water-insoluble inorganic and<br>
organic fine particulates, and fibers. Examples of the water-insoluble materials<br>
include finely divided metal powders such as powders of Pb, Sn, Mo, Cr, Si, Mo-Ni,<br>
Al-Si, Fe-Cr, Pb-Sn, Pb-Sn-Sb, Pb-Sn-Cu, etc.; oxides such as AI203, SiO2r 2rO2,<br>
Ti02, Th02, Y2O3, CeOe, etc.; nitrides such as Si3N4, TIN, BN, CBN, etc.; carbides<br>
such as TiC, WC, SiC, Cr3C2, B4C, ZrC, etc.; borides such as ZrB2, Cr3B2, etc.;<br>
carbon allotropes such as fluorinated graphite and nanodiamond; sulfides such as<br>
MoS2 ; other inorganic fine particulates; fluoride resins such as<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, epoxy resins, and rubber latexes; other organic fine<br>
particulates; and glass fibers, carbon fibers including nanotubes, various metal<br>
whiskers, and other inorganic and organic fibers including metal-polymer<br>
amphiphiles. Among them, hard or lubricating materials may be used particularly<br>
when it is intended to plate slide members. An example of a useful fluoride resin<br>
powder is Fluoro A650 an aqueous polytetrafluoroethylene dispersion from<br>
Shamrock Technical Incorporated.<br>
The fine particulates used in the practice of the present invention may<br>
preferably have a mean particle size of 0.01 to 200 urn, more preferably 0.1 to 20<br>
urn, and the fibers may preferably be 0.01 to 2000 urn long, more preferably 0.1 to<br>
60 urn long. The particulates and/or fibers may preferably be added to the plating<br>
bath in an amount of 5 to 500 gram/liter, more preferably 20 to 100 gram/liter.<br>
The plated film obtained from a composite plating bath having dispersed<br>
particulates or fibers as described above has an iron-phosphorus deposit as a<br>
matrix phase in which the particulates or fibers are codeposited and dispersed. The<br>
codeposited particulates or fibers add their inherent properties to the overall film<br>
while the matrix phase of iron-phosphorus deposit maintains its own good<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
Further, a water-soluble titanium compound and/or zirconium compound may<br>
be added to the plating baths of the present invention to produce composite plated<br>
films having improved abrasion resistance. The titanium and zirconium compounds<br>
used herein may be, for example, Na2TiF6, K2TiF6, (NH4)2TiF6, Ti(S04)2, Na2ZrF6,<br>
K2ZrF6, (NH4)2ZrF6, Zr(S04)2.4H20, etc. and mixtures thereof. The amount of the<br>
titanium or zirconium compounds added may be 0.05 to 10 grams, more preferably<br>
0.1 to 5 grams calculated as elemental titanium or zirconium per liter of the plating<br>
solution. Smaller amounts of the titanium or zirconium compounds are not effective<br>
in improving the abrasion resistance of the resulting plated film. Larger amounts<br>
cause the titanium or zirconium compounds to be suspended in the bath rather than<br>
dissolved and thus adhere to the plated film surface to give a gritty texture detracting<br>
from the appearance and abrasion resistance.<br>
The pH of the electroplating baths of the present invention during plating<br>
should be between about 0.5 to about 5. In other embodiments, the pH of the<br>
plating bath during plating may range from about 0.8 to about 2.5 or from about 1.5<br>
to about 2.0. In one embodiment, the temperature of the bath during plating is<br>
between about 10 and 80'C, and more often, is from about 40 to about 60'C.<br>
Useful iron-phosphorus alloys can be deposited from the plating baths of the<br>
present invention over a wide range of current densities. In one embodiment, the<br>
alloys are deposited from the electroplating baths of the present invention at a<br>
current density of from about 0.5 to about 300 A/dm2 or from about 50 to about 100<br>
A/dm2.<br>
The thickness of the iron phosphorus alloys deposited from the electroplating<br>
baths of the invention may range from about 1 to about 250 microns, and in another<br>
embodiment, from about 10-150 microns.<br>
The following examples illustrate the electroplating baths of the present<br>
invention unless otherwise indicated in the examples, all parts and percentages are<br>
by weight, temperatures are in degrees centigrade and pressure is at or near<br>
atmospheric pressure. The examples are illustrative and are not intended to be<br>

In one embodiment, the plating baths of this invention are useful for<br>
depositing an iron-phosphorus alloy on a variety of conductive substrates including<br>
iron, steel, aluminum alloys, etc. Thus the plating baths of the invention are useful<br>
in depositing an iron-phosphorus alloy on small parts, laminated materials, plates,<br>
wire rods, slide members etc. A typical example of a slide member is a skirt of a<br>
piston which is operated for sliding in a base of a high silicon aluminum alloy<br>
cylinder. Slider materials include magnesium alloys, gray cast iron, spring steel, tool<br>
steel and stainless steel. Other examples of slide members which may be plated<br>
with the electroplating baths of the invention include pistons, piston rings, piston<br>
rods, bearings, bored cylinders, shafts, clutch housings, clutch diaphragms, springs,<br>
etc.<br>
To demonstrate the improvements obtained with the baths of the present<br>
invention containing the sulfur-containing compounds, comparative plating baths are<br>
prepared similar to Examples 1 and 4 above but without the sulfur compound MRS.<br>

Work pieces of 4032 aluminum alloy, or AISIO1 (UNS T 31501) oil hardening<br>
tool steel alloy rods (mandrels) with diameters between 0.8 and 1.2 cm, or six inch<br>
by 2.5 inch stationary cast aluminum ADC 12 alloy panels are electroplated with the<br>
plating baths of examples 1 and 4 and Comparative Example 1 and Comparative<br>
Example 2 at a temperature of about 50'C with an applied direct current density of<br>
10 A/dm2. The mandrels are rotated at about 1000 rpm to provide solution speeds<br>
of about 3.6 m/minute, and the nodes are polypropylene bagged steel strips. In all<br>
the tests, the solution is continuously circulated with turnover rates of about 10 per<br>
hour.<br>
Typical processing sequences for steel and aluminum are:<br>
(1) sand mandrel sequentially with 320,400 and 600 grit sandpaper,<br>
(2) weigh mandrel,<br>
(3) tape areas that will not be plated, and carefully measure the area that<br>
will be plated,<br>
(4) prepare steel mandrels for plating by standard immersion in a hot<br>
alkaline electrocleaner followed by cold-water rinse (CWR), brief immersion in a<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid solution, and a second CWR,<br>
(5) prepare aluminum mandrels and panels for plating by a standard<br>
double zincate treatment.<br>
After plating is completed, the mandrels or panels are removed, rinsed, the<br>
tape removed, dried and then reweighed. Alloy morphology is observed by scanning<br>
electron microscope (SEM), composition is measured by energy dispersive<br>
spectroscopy (EDS) and in some cases by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy or<br>
proton induced x-ray immision. Current efficiency is calculated based upon<br>
determining the theoretical weight gain from the measured alloy composition and the<br>
weight that the measured product of current and time would produce for such an<br>
alloy using Faraday's law and the tables in Modern Electroplating, 4th Edition. Crack<br>
counts are obtained by observing the surface using optical microscopy (OM). The<br>
alloy phases are determined by x-ray powder defractometer CUka x-ray source.<br>
Adhesion is assessed by striking coupons or mandrels against a rotating sharp<br>
grinder and observing how much non-struck substrate is exposed adjacent to the<br>
struck substrate, or by heating the coupons to 300'C, quenching them into room<br>
temperature water, and observing the coating for signs of blistering or other<br>
decohesion. The thicknesses of the deposits are obtained by metallographic cross<br>
section, and hardness is determined by measuring the cross sectioned coating with<br>
a microhardness tester. The OM and SEM are obtained of representative cross<br>
sections.<br>
To assess the affect of the sulfur-modified electroplating baths to the<br>
Comparative Examples not containing the sulfur-containing compounds, several<br>
tests are performed where the mandrels or panels are tested before and after<br>
annealing. In all cases, the annealing furnace is pre-heated, samples are<br>
introduced and remain at the indicated temperature for 30 minutes. The samples<br>
are then withdrawn from the furnace and allowed to ballistically cool in a room<br>
temperature environment placed on top of a Kimax watch glass. The Vickers<br>
hardness of the deposit is determined. The results of these tests are summarized<br>
in Table I. As can be seen from the results, the initial hardness of the deposits<br>
obtained with the baths of Example 1 and Example 4 is higher than the hardness<br>
obtained in the Comparative Examples containing no sulfur compound. When the<br>
deposits of the Comparative Examples are annealed, there is a significant increase<br>
in hardness. In contrast, annealing of the deposits obtained from the baths of<br>
Examples 1 and 4 does not result in a significant increase in hardness.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
As mentioned above, the alloys which are deposited from the electroplating<br>
baths of the present invention contain iron, phosphorus and sulfur. The amount of<br>
phosphorus observed in the alloy varies directly with the amount of hypophosphite<br>
cc itained in the solution and the current density. This can be seen from the results<br>
of the experiments and tests with the electroplating baths of the invention containing<br>
varying amounts of hypophosphite. In Examples 11-15, the plating bath prepared<br>
as in Example 1 is modified to contain amounts of phosphorus varying from 0.016<br>
to 0.065 moles per liter, and the electroplating on aluminum 4032 rods or mandrels<br>
is carried out at 3 different current densities: 10 A/dm2; 20 A/dm2 and 30 A/dm2. The<br>
deposits obtained are analyzed for percent phosphorus. The results which are<br>
summarized in Table II indicate that the phosphorus content of the deposits varies<br>
with the hypophosphite concentration in the electroplating bath. The results also<br>
demonstrate that the hardness of the deposit generally increases with increasing<br>
phosphorus contents at the levels studied.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In one embodiment, the iron-phosphorus alloys which are obtained utilizing<br>
the electroplating baths of the present invention contain from about 70 to about 99<br>
atomic percent of iron, from about 1 to about 30 atomic percent of phosphorus and<br>
from about 0.1 to about 0.5 atomic percent of sulfur. In another embodiment, the<br>
alloy contains from about 92 to about 98% atomic percent of iron, from 1.7 to about<br>
7.5 atomic percent of phosphorus and from about 0.1 to about 1.2 atomic percent<br>
of sulfur.<br>
EDS is used to determine the phosphorus and sulfur concentration of a<br>
cross-sectioned deposit from the plating baths of Examples 1 and 4 deposited onto<br>
4032 aluminum mandrels. The deposits obtained with the plating baths of Example<br>
1 and Example 4 exhibit excellent uniformity throughout the cross section, and sulfur<br>
is detectable in the alloy. Confirmation of sulfur in the alloy is performed using<br>
proton induced x-ray immision spectroscopy (PIXE) and x-ray photoelectron<br>
spectroscopy (XPS).<br>
The adhesion of the deposited alloy deposited from the baths of Examples<br>
1 and 4 is improved by the presence of the aliphatic sulfur-containing compound<br>
-13-<br>
MRS. This is demonstrated by comparing the adhesion of the deposit obtained from<br>
electroplating baths from the baths of Examples 1 and 4 to the deposits obtained<br>
with the bath of Comparative Example 1 and Comparative Example 2, respectively.<br>
Two types of adhesion are studied on the steel and aluminum mandrels. The first<br>
type of adhesion is observation of blistering following heating to 300*C and plunging<br>
the hot rod and coating into water at about 10'C. The second adhesion test is<br>
observation of the distance from which the coating flakes away from the edge of a<br>
region that has been subjected to a grinding wheel. After some experimentation to<br>
obtain the best preparation cycle, comparison of the deposit from bath of Example<br>
1 with the deposit from the bath of Comparative Example 1 indicates that over 85%<br>
of the steel or aluminum rods exhibit good adhesion whereas only 38% of the steel<br>
and aluminum rods coated with the bath of Comparative Example 1 exhibit good<br>
adhesion. Although the alloy deposited from the bath of Example 4 does not exhibit<br>
good adhesion on steel, good adhesion on aluminum mandrels with the plating bath<br>
of Example 4 is obtained in over 80% of the tests whereas good adhesion of the<br>
deposit with the bath of Comparative Example 2 is obtained in only 30% of the tests.<br>
The crystallography of the. oy deposit obtained with the plating bath of<br>
Example 1 has been determined. Coupons that are coated with iron-phosphorus<br>
on the bath of Example 1 are observed using TEM XRPD and SEM, and the results<br>
indicate that the deposit is a mixture of a very fine grained 50-100 (nm) alpha iron<br>
in an amorphous FeP matrix. When this deposit is allowed to stand at room<br>
temperature without annealing for over one year, the deposit demonstrates a<br>
decrease in amorphous signal and an increase in alpha iron signal intensity when<br>
measured using a standard x-ray powder diffractometer and compared to fresh<br>
deposits. Both fresh and room temperature aged deposits show dramatic changes<br>
in crystallography after annealing. Annealing studies are carried out at temperatures<br>
of 200*C, 350'C, 500'C and 600'C. Samples annealed at temperatures above<br>
350'C with annealing times in excess of 30 minutes followed by cooling, do not<br>
exhibit further crystallographic changes.<br>
It has also been demonstrated that microcracking of the deposit is affected<br>
by the presence of the sulfur-containing compound in the electroplating baths.<br>
When the sulfur containing compound is absent (Comparative Examples 1 and 2)<br>
the iron-phosphorus deposits, after annealing, have large increases in crack count<br>
and, cross sections of the surfaces demonstrate that the cracks after annealing are<br>
much wider and often expose the substrate. The deposits obtained with the<br>
electroplating baths of the present invention, for example, Example 1 and Example<br>
K' ~!<br>
4, do not show a variation in the crack count after annealing, the average crack<br>
Widths are not increased, and cracks extending from surface to substrate are rare.<br>
It also has been discovered that the presence of the sulfur-containing<br>
compounds in the plating baths of the present invention as described above<br>
provides the bath with improved stability. The plating baths of the invention, after<br>
electrolysis, do not exhibit any variation in color or pressure (signs of decomposition)<br>
on storing. In contrast, the plating bath of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 which<br>
have been subjected to electrolysis show significant oxidation of the ferrous ion to<br>
ferric ion on standing.<br>
While the invention has been explained in relation to its various embodiments,<br>
it is to be understood that other modifications thereof will become apparent<br>
to those skilled in the art upon reading the specification. Therefore, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention disclosed herein is intended to cover such modifications<br>
as fall within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br>
