				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel transportable device for lifting and flaying animals. Animals dying of natural death pose disposal problem adding to environmental pollution The device of the present invention is envisaged to have enormous potential application not only for lifting these animals, but also for recovering the hide/skin of the dead animal for appropriate processing in leather industry to result in value addition. The transportable feature of the device renders it suitable for collecting many such animals in a wide area. Using this vehicle a flayer -cum - driver can go to the site immediately, lift the animal single handedly and bring it to nearby flaying center for flaying and processing very efficiently and quickly If carcass center is away from the site of death, the animal can be flayed at the site itself using the device fitted in the vehicle. This enables collection of precious hide, which may be preserved for subsequent processing. Device can also be used for lifting live animal for transportation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
India is rich depository of livestock It possesses 212 Million cattle, 90 Million buffalo, 123 Million goats and 60 Million sheep. The hides and skins from these animals are the basic raw material for leather industry. In India average mortality rate per annum (average of 10 states) is 8.69 % for cattle, 13.3 % for buffalo, 11.07 % for goats and 12.97 % for sheep if we exclude small animals (goat and sheep) and calculate the animal's mortality we find 23 million of cattle and buffalo available every year as fallen stock in the country. Indian leather industry underwent a period of phenomenal growth during the seventh plan, but the projected growth rate during the eighth plan had to be downsized to a modest level of 16 % per annum for the entire sector and to 18% in the export category due to severe raw material (hides &amp; skins) crunch. Proper recovery of hides &amp; skins from fallen animals is therefore of extreme significance, as it can solve this problem.<br>
Un-scientific flaying and faulty transportation of fallen animals result in poor quality of hides and skins. These poor quality substrates when converted to leather do not match with the standards laid down for particular end usage Overall it has significant bearing on the final quality of leather goods and footwear. Such material cannot be exported to meet the demand and increase our export of quality leather goods. To<br>
 <br>
meet the demand, India has started importing hides and skins. At present the practices followed by flayers result into recovery of poor quality hides and skins, do not serve the leather industry to make quality leather goods. The traditional flayers in our countryside are not equipped with modern tools and gadgets and flaying is done manually on the ground. There is also considerable delay in flaying and animal is also manually dragged before flaying.<br>
Manual ripping of hides and skins from fallen animals is associated with following limitations<br>
1	Flay cuts occur due to unscientific flaying and use of poor quality flaying tools.<br>
2	More than two persons are needed to transport the animal to flaying center.<br>
S.Microbial damage occurs due to delayed flaying, which ultimately affects quality<br>
of hides.<br>
4 There is considerable grain damage to the hides due to dragging of the fallen<br>
animals<br>
5.Once the hide/skin is removed after flaying, the remaining part of the carcass<br>
remains largely unutilized, rendering economical loss on the one hand and adding<br>
to environmental hazard on the other.<br>
The above limitations have necessitated exploring possibilities for better collection and flaying system, especially for fallen animals, to ensure better economic utilization of the animals.<br>
Huub and Rene (Patent No. EP1262365) developed a truck trailer for transporting animals in particular cattle for breeding and or slaughter. The device is essentially an air-conditioned load space meant for transporting live animals. While it enables transporting any carcass, the major limitation of the device is that it is not provided with any mechanism for collection and flaying of animals.<br>
Cruysen et ai (EP1508277) have provided a device for processing slaughtered animals and /or parts thereof, with special reference to poultry. The device is essentially a conveyor system, which enables completing the flaying operation of poultry animals in a sequential manner. The major limitation of this device is that it is not applicable for animals, which are bigger than poultry varieties.<br>
 <br>
Noroy (US Patent No, 4376326) provided an apparatus for flaying sheep, whereby the animal is suspended in inverted position by hooking the hind legs. The carcass is held in position by a stretching device, while the skin is ripped and collected with the help of an overhead conveyor. The major limitation of this apparatus is that the device is primarily meant for flaying a small animal such as sheep. Moreover, the apparatus requires to be positioned at a defined location for flaying of animal. Hence, it does not support collection of carcasses from scattered areas. Another limitation of the apparatus is that the hydraulic system used for stretching as well as flaying of animal involves enormous capital investment, thereby rendering the system not feasible from economical point of view, especially in rural areas.<br>
While summarizing, it is quite evident that different attempts have been made to provide appropriate devices towards flaying animals and transporting. But in the specific context of minimizing the economical loss caused to the industry due to non-collection of fallen animals there is still a need to provide an appropriate system for collection of animals from remote places, transporting and utilization of the body parts in an effective manner.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main objective of the invention is to provide a novel transportable device for lifting and ripping of dead animal, which obviates the limitations as stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to flay the fallen animal at the site in order to preserve the precious hide.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to transport the fallen animal immediately to nearby carcass recovery center.<br>
Still another objective of this present invention is to facilitate to carry out the work without any support from any electrical energy.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The device is essentially a group of various elements assembled and fixed to the rear side of the vehicle (1) The frame having two vertical column members (9) connected through a horizontal arm (13) provided with a chain block (18) and pulley (14) is firmly connected to the vehicle (1) The strut (10) moves in the vertical plane upto an inclination of 45 degree and it is connected to the vehicle (1) by hinge mechanism (6). With the help of the telescopic arrangement (11), which is connected to the strut (8), the height from the ground and the distance from the rear side of the vehicle (1) can be positioned based on the size and shape of the fallen animal. A handle wheel (16) to operate the gear drum (17) and another handle wheel (2) to rotate the tie rod<br>
 <br>
(3) are assembled such a way that one person can rotate both the wheels simultaneously to perform the task. The lightweight cord (15) capable of lifting a weight upto 10kN is passed through the frictionless pulleys (12 and 14) and connected to the gear drum (17). The other end of the lightweight cord is connected to a hook (8). The fallen dead animal is hooked at (8) and the gear drum (17) is operated in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction using the hand wheel (16) to lift the animal vertically up side down for flaying. As soon as the flay cuts are performed on the dead animal, one end of the chain (7) having clamps is gripped with the hide and is passed through the SFF (4) which is housed in the vehicle (1) and the other end is connected to the chain block (18). With the help of a knife the hide of the hoisted animal is given flays cuts and a portion of hides striped along the flay cuts for fixing the clamps (7). Once the hide is gripped at one end of the chain (7), the other end is passed through the SFF (4) and connected to the chain block (18). Then the gear drum (17) is rotated to lift the animal and rip the hide. As the animal is lifted up, the ripping takes place with the help of chain block (18) in downward direction through SFF (4) in such a way that the ripping takes place without damaging the hide. The ripped hide is collected for further use. The hoisted carcass is moved to the rear side of the vehicle (1) by rotating the hand wheel (2) of the tie rod (3) in reverse direction such that the top portion of the strut moves towards the rear side of the vehicle (1) for transportation.<br>
The inventiveness of the present invention lies not only in providing a strut to hold the dead animal with the help of hook but also in providing clamp with chain arrangement enabling movement of dead animal and ripped hide in to opposite directions simultaneously. A further aspect of inventiveness is that the device is enabled to be placed in a vehicle enabling its transportable feature.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Hand wheels of gear drum and tie-rod were rotated simultaneously aligning both in such a way as to make the strut to move away from the rear side of the vehicle and<br>
 <br>
to make the cord with hook to drop down by side of the buffalo. Holes were made at both hind legs of the dead animal with the help of a knife and the animal was hooked. The hind legs of the animal were then clamped tightly and hand wheel of the gear drum was rotated in opposite direction, (without rotating the wheel of the tie rod) to lift the animal up side down. With the help of a knife the hide of the hoisted animal was given flays cuts and 2" long hide along the flay cuts at the hind legs side of the carcass for fixing the clamps. Once the ripped hide by the clamp the drum was rotated to lift the animal and rip the hide. The hooks on the cord along with the carcass were lifted up to a height of 2.8 m. from the ground level and a gap of 1.4 m was maintained from the rear side of the vehicle. While the animal was lifting upward, by rotating the hand wheel of the gear drum, the ripping took place down ward through SFF while operating the chain block. Simultaneously both lifting and ripping activities took place by operating both the gear drum and the chain block. The ripped hide was collected.<br>
The hide was preserved with salt for further processing in a tannery. The hoisted carcass was moved to the rear side of the vehicle by rotating the handle of the tie rod in reverse direction such that the strut moved towards the vehicle to keep the animal in the rear side of the vehicle for transporting the same.<br>
Example 2<br>
Hand wheels of gear drum and tie-rod were rotated simultaneously aligning both in such a way as to make the strut to move away from the rear side of the vehicle and to make the cord with hook to drop down by side of the cow (dead animal) Holes were made at both hind legs of the dead animal with the help of a knife and the animal was hooked The hind legs of the animal were then clamped tightly and hand wheel of the gear drum was rotated in opposite direction, (without rotating the wheel of the tie rod) to lift the animal up side down. With the help of a knife the hide of the hoisted animal was given flays cuts and 2" long hide along the flay cuts at the hind legs side of the carcass for fixing the clamps. Once the ripped hide by the clamp the drum was rotated to lift the animal and rip the hide. The hooks on the cord along with the carcass were lifted up to a height of 2.5 m. from the ground level and a gap of 1.2 m was maintained from the rear side of the vehicle. While the animal was lifting<br>
 <br>
upward, by rotating the hand wheel of the gear drum, the ripping took place down ward through SFF while operating the chain block. Simultaneously both lifting and ripping activities took place by operating both the gear drum and the chain block. The ripped hide was collected.<br>
The hide was taken further, for E.I. tanning by the artisans at the site to avoid for preservation The hoisted carcass was moved to the rear side of the vehicle by rotating the handle of the tie rod in reverse direction such that the strut moved towards the vehicle to keep the animal in the rear side of the vehicle for transporting the same.<br>
Example 3<br>
Hand wheels of gear drum and tie-rod were rotated simultaneously aligning both in such a way as to make the strut to move away from the rear side of the vehicle and to make the cord with hook to drop down by side of the calf. Holes were made at both hind legs of the dead animal with the help of a knife and the animal was hooked. The hind legs of the animal were then clamped tightly and hand wheel of the gear drum was rotated in opposite direction, (without rotating the wheel of the tie rod) to lift the animal up side down With the help of a knife the hide of the hoisted animal was given flays cuts and 2" long hide along the flay cuts at the hind legs side of the carcass for fixing the clamps. Once the ripped hide by the clarnp the drum was rotated to lift the animal and rip the hide. The hooks on the cord along with the carcass were lifted up to a height of 3.0 m. from the ground level and a gap of 1.6 m was maintained from the rear side of the vehicle. While the animal was lifting upward, by rotating the hand wheel of the gear drum, the ripping took place down ward through SFF while operating the chain block. Simultaneously both lifting and ripping activities took place by operating both the gear drum and the chain block. The ripped hide was collected.<br>
The hide was preserved with salt for further processing in a tannery. The hoisted carcass was moved to the rear side of the vehicle by rotating the handle of the tie rod in reverse direction such that the strut moved towards the vehicle to keep the animal in the rear side of the vehicle for transporting the same.<br>
 <br>
