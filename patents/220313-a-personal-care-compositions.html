				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to surfactant compositions and particularly to such compositions in which block copolymeric surfactants are used to disperse aqueous phases in oil phases in personal care products.<br>
Polymeric surfactants are known for use in stabilising oil water interfaces, particularly in water-in-oil emulsions oil-in-water emulsions and dispersions. Such surfactants, include A-B-A block co-polymeric surfactants in which the A blocks are polyester blocks, particularly polyesters of hydroxy aliphatic acids e.g. of hydroxystearic acid to give polyhydroxy stearate (PHS) blocks, and the B block is a polyalkylene glycol block, especially a polyethylene glycol (PEG) block. Such surfactants are described in EP 0000424 and their use in stabilising the emulsion used in inverse emulsion acrylamide polymerisation in GB 2157744 and US 4776966. The molecules of these surfactants have a shape that makes them particularly useful Tti stabilising water-in-oil dispersions and emulsions. It is believed that, at the oil/water interface, the molecule sits with the hydrophilic PEG block in the water phase and the two hydrophobic PHS blocks in the oil phase. This arrangement gives good packing at the interface and is believed to contribute to the effectiveness of these materials. Originally, this type of surfactant was, manufactured by a process which used an organic solvent, typically xylene, so that the final product included trace quantities of the solvent that effectively precluded the use of these surfactants in skin contact applications. More recently, a variant of this type of surfactant has become available made by a method which does not involve the use of organic solvents such as xylene and this opens up the possibility of using such materials in personal care applications. These surfactants have proved to be useful water-in-oil dispersants and emulsifiers.<br>
The present invention is based on our discovery that this type of surfactant can achieve particularly good results in certain types of formulation. In particular, in formulations including relatively high concentrations of solutes in a dispersed hydrophilic phase and in the manufacture of multiple emulsions by a particularly convenient route.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a personal care composition which is or includes a hydrophile-in-oil emulsion or dispersion which includes as a dispersant and/or emulsifying agent a block copolymeric surfactant of the formula: A-B-A where<br>
each group A is independently an oligo- or polyester residue of a hydroxycarboxylic acid, having a molecular weight of from 900 to 3000 Daltons (Da); and<br>
B       is a polyoxyalkylene chain having a molecular weight of from 400 to 2500 Da,<br>
and in which the dispersed hydrophile phase is or includes dissolved therein one or more polyol,<br>
alcohol, electrolyte or urea.<br>
The block group A is typically made up of repeat units of the formula:<br>
- O - CH [(CH2)a.CH3].(CH2)b.COO-<br>
where a is typically from 3 to 8 and b is typically from 8 to 12 and a+b is typically from 11 to 17 (corresponding to overall carbon chain lengths in the precursor acid of 14 to 20). The repeat units in the blocks A are particularly desirably of 12-hydoxystearic acid i.e. where a is 5 and b is 10. Desirably, the number of fatty acid residues in each block A residues is on average from 3 to 10 (900 to 3000 Da), particularly from about 5 to about 8 (about 1500 to about 2400 Da) and especially about 7 (about 2100 Da).<br>
In practice, such acids are commercially available as mixtures of the hydroxy acid and the corresponding unsubstituted fatty acid. Thus, 12-hydroxystearic acid is typically manufactured by hydrogenation of castor oil fatty acids including the C18 unsaturated hydroxy acid and the non-substituted unsaturated fatty acids (oleic and linoleic acids) which on hydrogenation gives a mixture of 12-hydroxystearic and stearic acids. During manufacture of the polyester chains, the presence of the unsubstituted acid acts to limit the chain length of the oligomer or polymer. Hydroxystearic acid is available containing about 15% unsubstituted stearic acid and this on polymerisation gives an average chain length of about 6 hydroxystearate residues terminated by a stearic acid residue.<br>
The polyoxyalkylene chain is desirably a polyoxyethylene chain and, in particular, it has a molecular weight of from about 400 to about 2000 Da and especially about 1500 Da.<br>
A particularly useful material is the solvent free block copolymer polymeric surfactant sold by ICI Surfactants under the trade name Arlacel P135 which has a PEG residue with a molecular weight of about 1500, corresponding to about 34 ethylene oxide repeat units, and polyhydroxystearate residues each containing about 7 acid residues each, corresponding to a chain molecular weight of about 2100, and an overall molecular weight of about 5.5 to 6 kD<br>
The oil phase used in the invention is typically an emollient oil which may be liquid or solid at ambient temperature. Suitable liquid emollient oils include non-polar oils such as mineral oils e.g. paraffin or /so-paraffin oils, and polar oils, particularly ester oils such as triglyceride oil e.g. vegetable oils or synthetic triglycerides, synthetic ester oils ether oils silicone oils and alkoxylated<br>
oils. Suitable emollients that are solid at ambient temperature include emollient waxes such as paraffin waxes, ozokerite, beeswax and vegetable waxes e.g. castor wax and candelilla wax.<br>
The oil phase may include other components such as essential oils, oil soluble vitamins, antioxidants, pigments, hydrophobic silica (such as Aerosil R972 ex Degussa), DVB and UVA sunscreen agents, and similar materials.<br>
The hydrophile phase can be a solution in water of the hydrophilic material or can, in certain cases, be a substantially water free liquid phase of the hydrophilic material. Thus the invention includes:<br>
1	a personal care composition which is or includes a water-in-oil emulsion or dispersion in<br>
which the dispersed water phase includes dissolved therein at least one electrolyte,<br>
particularly where the electrolyte is aluminium and/or zirconium chlorohydrate, sodium<br>
chloride or a salt of an organic acids such as sodium lactate, and particularly at a<br>
concentration of from 0.1 to 25% by weight of the aqueous phase, and which further includes<br>
as a dispersant and/or emulsifying agent a block copolymeric surfactant of the formula:<br>
A - B - A where A and B are as defined above;<br>
2	a personal care composition which is or includes a water-in-oil emulsion or dispersion in<br>
which the dispersed water phase includes urea dissolved therein, particularly at a<br>
concentration of from 0.1 to 20% by weight of the aqueous phase, and which further includes<br>
as a dispersant and/or emulsifying agent a block copolymeric surfactant of the formula:<br>
A - B - A where A and B are as defined above;<br>
3	a personal care composition which is or includes a hydrophile-in-oil emulsion or dispersion in<br>
which the dispersed hydrophile phase is a polyol or is water having a polyol dissolved<br>
therein, particularly glycerol, glycerol ethoxylated with from 1 to 100 moles of ethylene oxide,<br>
propylene glycol (1,2 propane diol), butylene and/or hexylene glycol, sorbitol, sorbitol<br>
ethoxylated with form 1 to 100 moles of ethylene oxide and polyethylene glycol (especially<br>
having a molecular weight distribution between 200 to 6000 Da with a typical average<br>
molecular weight of about 1500 Da), and which further includes as a dispersant and/or<br>
emulsifying agent a block copolymeric surfactant of the formula: A - B - A where A and B are<br>
as defined above; and<br>
4	a personal care composition which is or includes a water-in-oil emulsion or dispersion in<br>
which the dispersed water phase includes at least one alcohol dissolved therein, particularly<br>
in an amount of from 1 to 40%, and which further includes as a dispersant and/or emulsifying<br>
agent a block copolymeric surfactant of the formula: A - B - A where A and B are as defined<br>
above.<br>
In such systems the polymeric surfactant is typically used in an amount of 0.5 to 5%, more usually from 1 to 2%, by weight of the total emulsion.<br>
Particularly for the hydrophile-in-oil emulsion (possibility 3 above) the system can be formulated as a multiple water-in-oil-in-water emulsion, by dispersing the hydrophile-in-oil emulsion in water, i.e. using conventional 2-step multiple emulsion manufacturing methods. Such double emulsions can contain from 30 to 90%, particularly from 50 to 80%, by weight based on the total multiple emulsion of the primary internal phase. Where the hydrophile is a glycol or glycerol, particularly where it is glycerol, the hydrophile phase may contain little if any water. This opens the possibility of making aqueous emulsions containing water sensitive materials, or materials that are sensitive to other environmental effects e.g. oxidation, in the presence of water, such as some water soluble vitamins especially vitamin C. The water sensitive material is dissolved in the hydrophile phase emulsified in an oil continuous phase and this emulsion is then emulsified into water or an aqueous phase.<br>
The invention includes a method of making an oil-in-water emulsion containing water-in-oil droplets which includes forming a mixture of an oil phase and oil-in-water primary emulsifier for dispersing oil in an aqueous phase including also an oil soluble copolymer surfactant of the formula : A - B - A where A and B are defined as above, and adding to the oil mixture under stirring to an aqueous phase.<br>
In forming in-sltu multiple emulsions by this method it is necessary to include surfactants that promote the formation of the multiple emulsion i.e. act as a primary emulsifier for the oil droplets in the water. Suitable primary emulsifier surfactants are combinations of hydrophilic surfactants such<br>
as fatty alcohol, e.g. C12 to C22 fatty alcohols, ethoxylates having a high degree of ethoxylation e.g.<br>
an average of more than 15 ethoxylate residues per molecule, such as the hydrophilic ethoxylates supplied by ICI Surfactants under the trade designation Brij, particularly Brij 721, Brij 78, Brij 98 and<br>
Brij 99, and hydrophobic surfactants such as fatty alcohol, e.g. C12 to C22 fatty alcohols, ethoxylates having a low degree of ethoxylation e.g. an average of not more than 5, and usually not more than 3, ethoxylate residues per molecule, such as the hydrophobic ethoxylates supplied by ICI Surfactants under the trade designation Brij, particularly Brij 72, Brij 92 and Brij 93. Such combinations can form liquid crystal like phases at or near the oil-water interface and stabilise the oil droplets. The formation of these liquid crystal phases is enhanced by the inclusion of<br>
amphiphiles such as fatty alcohols, in particular C12 to C22 fatty alcohols, (in addition to any residual fatty alcohol which may be present especially in the hydrophobic component of the primary<br>
emulsifier) in the primary emulsitler. The relative amounts of hydrophilic surfactant and hydrophobic surfactant depend on the multiple emulsion system but are typically in the weight range 3:1 to 1:5, particularly 1:1 to 1:2, especially about 1:1.5. The relative weight of added fatty alcohol based on the combination of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfactants will usually be in the range 1:10 to 1:1, more usually 1:5 to 1:2.<br>
In general the multiple emulsion can be made by dissolving the hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfactants in the oil phase and adding the oil phase to the water phase under stirring. Conveniently this is done at moderately elevated temperatures e.g. between ambient temperature and 90°C, more usually between 70 and 85°C.<br>
The amount of the polymeric surfactant used in making multiple emulsions in this way will typically be from 0.1 to 2% by weight of the total multiple emulsion. The amount of the primary emulsifier surfactant system (including any additional fatty alcohol) used is typically from 0.5 to 12%, particularly from about 3 to about 8% and especially from 5 to 7%, by weight of the total multiple emulsion.<br>
This method has the practical advantage that only one emulsification step is needed in order to form a double/multiple emulsion, thus, thus simplifying and cheapening the production process. However, the method is restricted to such systems where the main external (aqueous) phase and the second internal (aqueous) phase are formed from the same aqueous phase, although post emulsification additions to the main external (aqueous) phase does enable the manufacture of systems where the two aqueous phases are not the same.<br>
In the double emulsion made by this method, the oil phase can be similar to those described above. However, it is very desirable that the oil is a solvent for the polymeric surfactant to aid manufacture.<br>
The oil phase may include other components such as essential oils, oil soluble vitamins, antioxidants, pigments, hydrophobic silica (such as Aerosil R972 ex Degussa), UVB and UVA sunscreen agents, and similar materials.<br>
