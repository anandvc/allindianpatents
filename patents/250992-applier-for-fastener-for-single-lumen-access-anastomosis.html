Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates, in general, to devices and methods for surgically<br>
modifying organs and vessels. More particularly, it relates to anastomosis devices for<br>
joining two organs such as, for example, two separate lengths of small bowel to each<br>
other, a section of small bowel to the stomach, or the common bile duct to the<br>
duodenum in a procedure called a choledochoduodenostomy. Vascular anastomosis<br>
may be performed as well.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
(0003] The percentage of the world population suffering from morbid obesity is<br>
steadily increasing. Severely obese persons are susceptible to increased risk of heart<br>
disease, stroke, die betes, pulmonary disease, and accidents. Because of the effect of<br>
morbid obesity to ;he life of the patient, methods of treating morbid obesity are being<br>
researched.<br>
[0004] Numerous ion-operative therapies for morbid obesity have been tried with<br>
virtually no permanent success. Dietary counseling, behavior modification, wiring a<br>
patient's jaws shut, and pharmacological methods have all been tried, and though<br>
temporarily effective, failed to correct the condition. Further, introducing an object in<br>
the stomach, such as an esophagogastric balloon, to fill the stomach have also been<br>
used to treat the condition; however, such approaches tend to cause irritation to the<br>
stomach and are not effective long-term.<br>
[ooo5] Surgical treatments of morbid obesity have been increasingly used with<br>
greater success. These approaches may be generalized as those that reduce the<br>
effective size of the stomach, limiting the amount of food intake, and those that create<br>
malabsorption of the food that it is eaten. For instance, some patients benefit from<br>
adjustable gastric bands (AGB) that are advantageously laparoscopically placed about<br>
the stomach to forn a stoma of a desired size that allows food to fill an upper portion<br>
of the stomach, cansing a feeling of satiety. To allow adjustment of the size of the<br>
stoma after importation, a fluid conduit communicates between an inwardly<br>
presented fluid bladder of the AGB to a fluid injection port subcutaneously placed in<br>
front of the patient's sternum. A syringe needle may then inject or withdraw fluid as<br>
desired to adjust the AGB.<br>
[0006] Although an effective approach to obesity for some, other patients may find<br>
the lifestyle changes undesirable, necessitated by the restricted amount of food intake.<br>
In addition, the medical condition of the patient may suggest the need for a more<br>
permanent solution. To that end, surgical approaches have been used to alter the<br>
portions of the stomach and/or small intestine available for digesting food. Creating<br>
an anastomosis, or the surgical formation of a passage between two normally distinct<br>
vessels, is a critical step of many surgical procedures. This is particularly true of<br>
gastric bypass procedures in which two portions of small intestine are joined together<br>
and another portion of small intestine is joined to the stomach of the patient. This is<br>
also true of surgery to alleviate blockage in the common bile duct by draining bile<br>
from the duct to the small intestine during surgery for pancreatic cancer.<br>
[0007] With particular reference to gastric bypass; procedures, current methods of<br>
performing a laparoscopic anastomoses for a gastric bypass include stapling, suturing,<br>
and placing biofragmentable rings, each having significant challenges. For instance,<br>
suturing is time consuming, as well as being technique and dexterity dependent.<br>
Stapling requires placement of an anvil, which is a large device that cannot be<br>
introduced through a trocar port Having to introduce the port through a laparotomy<br>
presents an increased incidence of wound site infection associated with Intraluminal<br>
content being dragged to the laparotomy entry she.<br>
[0008] As an example of the latter approach, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,543,456 a method for<br>
gastric bypass surgery includes the insertion of proximal and distal anastomosis<br>
members (e.g., anvils) transorally with grasping forceps. The stomach and the small<br>
intestine are transacted endoscopically by a surgical severing and stapling instrument<br>
to create a gastric pouch, a drainage loop, and a Roux limb. An endoscopically<br>
inserted circular s apler attaches to the distal anastomosis member to join the drainage<br>
loop to a distal portion of the intestine, and the circular stapler attaches to the<br>
proximal anastomasis member to join the Roux limb to the gastric pouch. Thereafter,<br>
the anastomosis members are removed to create an orifice between joined portions of<br>
the stomach and intestine. This method reduces the number oflaparoscopic ports,<br>
avoids a laparoscopic insertion of an anastomosis instrument (e.g., circular stapler)<br>
into an enlarged s lrgical port, and eliminates the need for an enterotomy and an<br>
enterotomy closure.<br>
[ooo9] For many inastomoses, surgeons use circular staplers, linear staplers, or<br>
manual sutures. However, to reduce incision size and to make the surgical process<br>
less technically demanding and time consuming, an anastomotic device that deforms<br>
to hold tissue portions together when the device is ejected from a constraining<br>
enclosure has been described. Such an approach is described in U.S. Pat. Appl. Publ.<br>
No. US 2003/003:1967 and PCT application WO 03/000142 both to Adrian Park et al,<br>
which is hereby ircorporated herein by reference, describes such a device. Therein,<br>
gastrointestinal or enteric (including biliary) anastomosis is achieved by insertion of a<br>
sheath that perforates the walls of two tissue passages, such as the stomach and small<br>
intestine. A three- limensional woven tube of wire of having a thermal shape memory<br>
effect (SME) ("generally-known nitinol ring device") is presented by a cannula of the<br>
sheath on both sides of the openings. Deployment of the woven tube causes the outer<br>
loops or ends of the tube to fold or loop back to hold the luminal interface of the<br>
anastomosis site in apposition. Thereby, the need for a mechanical compression<br>
component in a delivery system is reduced or avoided, reducing the size and<br>
complexity of the delivery device.<br>
[0010] The anasto notic device disclosed in WO 03/000142 is constrained by a<br>
retractable sheath ;o an advantageous small-diameter tubular shape. A surgeon applies<br>
the anastomotic device by maneuvering the sheath through the tissue portions<br>
requiting anastomosis and retracting the sheath. Retracting the sheath removes the<br>
constraint on the device, allowing the device to assume a roughly hourglass shape.<br>
The larger ends of the hourglass shape hold the two tissue portions together in an<br>
effective anastomosis.<br>
[0011] The constmined anastomotic device, which may be made of a shape memory<br>
material such as nitinol, exerts a force against the inner diameter of the sheath and<br>
tends to warp towards its roughly hourglass-shaped deployed position. When the<br>
sheath is retracted proximally, the forces generated by the device in transition from a<br>
tubular shape to an hourglass shape urge the anastomotic device distally. This device<br>
movement makes surgical control harder to achieve when placing the device through<br>
the otomies of two tissue portions requiring anastomosis.<br>
[0012]| While the generally-known nitinol ring device is a significant advancement in<br>
the treatment of morbid obesity, it is believed that further improvements would be<br>
desirable. For instance, weaving the wire strands and fastening together the ends and<br>
heat treating the woven tubes into an SME device is expensive. In addition, it may<br>
tend to be difficult to maintain two lumens that are to be anastomotized in extremely<br>
close contact in order for the generally-known nitinol ring device to successfully<br>
attach to both sides. Having to insert one or more grasping tools along with the<br>
anastomosis ring applier tends to mitigate the advantages of a single lumen<br>
anastomosis by requiring multiple access ports. Moreover, even if the lumens are<br>
proximately position, the generally-known nitinol ring device tends to actuate slowly,<br>
if at all, by being limited to SME actuation.<br>
[0013]| Consequertly, there is a general need for an device for single lumen access<br>
anastomosis that can be used in existing trocar perls (e.g., 12 mm size) and that<br>
reliably and effectively creates an anastomotic attachment between lumens,<br>
eliminating the need for surgical stapling and suturing to form an anastomosis<br>
Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
[0014] The invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior<br>
art by providing an applier for an absorbable ring for a single lumen access<br>
anastomosis, the combination being suitable and sufficient to perform lumen control<br>
and apposition as well as enterotomy control. The applier that may be inserted<br>
through a trocar and applied without any additional parts such as an anvil. The applier<br>
holds the absorbable ring that has distal and proximal arm segments that the applier<br>
individually actuares to enhance control. For instance, the distal arm segments may be<br>
expanded in a distal lumen, which is then drawn back into closer contact with the<br>
proximal lumen before actuating the proximal arm segment. Alternatively, the<br>
proximal arm segments may be expanded first and the first lumen positioned relative<br>
to the second lumen. Thereby, positioning the two lumens to be anastomotized is<br>
simplified.<br>
[0015] In one aspect of the invention, an applier has an implement portion that<br>
receives an anastomosis ring device with an unactuated shape of a cylinder with a<br>
proximal ring at one end and a distal ring at the other. The ring device further has<br>
proximal arms that are attached to the proximal ring and has distal arms are attached<br>
to the distal ring. Inwardly directed ends of the dastal arms are coupled to inwardly<br>
directed ends of the proximal arms at a center ring such that the arms will outwardly<br>
actuate when the tings arc drawn closer together during actuation. The ring device has<br>
a latching mechanism that locks the rings in this actuated shape of a rivet. The applier<br>
engages the ring such that the spacing of the distal ring to the center ring and the<br>
spacing of the proximal ring to the center ring may be reduced, causing actuation and<br>
latching. Then, the implement portion is removed from the ring device. Thus, a<br>
single lumen procedure is achieved without the need for a separate anvil device to<br>
actuate (he device Moreover, since the applier affirmatively actuates the ring device,<br>
limitations of generally-known shape memory effect (SME) actuation of a wire stent-<br>
like ring device are avoided.<br>

apparent from the accompanying drawings and the description thereof.<br>

Detailed Description of :he Invention<br>
[002S| Turning to the Drawings, wherein like numerals denote like components<br>
throughout the several views, FIG. 1 depicts an applier 10 having an elongate<br>
implement portion 12 dimensionally sized for insertion through a cannula of a trocar<br>
or laparoscopic pert to tissues walls 14, 16 to anastomose two lumens. A distal<br>
introducer tip 18 of the applier 10 pierces through an opening 20 at an anastomosis<br>
site 22 to position an actuating portion 24 that holds a ring device 30 for single lumen<br>
anastomosis.<br>
|0026| The ring device 30 has three primary rings, depicted as a proximal ring 32, a<br>
center ring 34, and a distal ring 36, that are cylindncally aligned with one another.<br>
The proximal ring 32 is longitudinally attached to the center ring 34 by proximal arms<br>
38, which in tuni s longitudinally attached to the distal ring 36 by distal amis 40.<br>
Each proximal and distal arm 38,40 is bisected respectively by a hinged joint 42, 44<br>
defining an inner irm segment 46, 48 also hingeclly attaching to the center ring 34 and<br>
an outer arm segment SO, 52 also hingediy attached to the respective proximal or<br>
distal ring 32, 36. In its unactuated state as depicted in FIG. 1, the device 30 is<br>
cylindrical. The n lative lengths of the inner arm segments 46, 48 to outer arm<br>
segments 50, 52 may be selected to provide a desired angular contact to tissue walls<br>
14, 16. In the illustrative version, the relationship resembles a cantilevered contact<br>
with the inner am segments 46, 48 actuating to an approximately parallel relationship<br>
to the tissue walls 14, 16.<br>
[O027| A handle portion 54 is proximally connected to a shaft 56 of the implement<br>
portion 12. The si aft 56 may be rigid or flexible, with the latter being desirable for<br>
Intralumenal inseition, such as through the esophagus. The handle includes controls<br>
for longitudinally positioning the rings 32-36 of the ring device 30. In the illustrative<br>
version, this includes a center nng slide control 58 and a distal ring slide control 60.<br>
Although a manually positioned and actuated applier 10 is depicted for clarity, it<br>
should be appreciated that a remotely positioned and actuated applier may be used<br>
consistent with asaects of the invention, for instance to allow placement in a more<br>
controlled nian.nei, to avoid disturbing an imaging modality, or for other reasons. The<br>
handle 54 may fuither include controls for a distal tip illumination capability so that<br>
actuation of the distal arms 40 in the distal lumen may be proximally viewed from an<br>
endoscope. It will be appreciated that the terms "proximal" and "distal" are used<br>
herein with refereice to a clinician gripping the handle portion 54 of the applier 10.<br>
[0O28| In FIG. 2, two slide controls 58, 62 have been withdrawn proximally, bringing<br>
both the center and distal rings 34, 36 into locking proximity of the proximal ring 32,<br>
which is held in piace by resting against the shafl 56. In response thereto, the<br>
proximal and distal arms 38, 40 hinge outwardly from the longitudinal axis of the<br>
device 30, creating a hollow rivet or hourglass shape for apposing tissue walls 14, 16.<br>
The center ring 34 sits at a tissuejunction between lumens and the distal and proximal<br>
rings 32, 36 come to rest in respective lumens. By latching rings 32-38 one to another<br>
when actuated, (he device 30 is held in the actuated position with bent arms 38,40<br>
apposing tissue. Tie proximal arms 38 may be staggered, as depicted, from distal<br>
arms 40 to create i. tortuous path for the compressed tissue. Alternatively, the arms<br>
38, 40 may be aliened to directly mate to each other.<br>
|0029| It should b; appreciated that in the illustrative version, the proximal ring 36 is<br>
stationary with respect to the applier 10. In some applications, a third control may be<br>
incorporated so that each of the tliree rings may be positioned independently from the<br>
rest, further enhancing the ability to actuate either the distal or the proximal arms 40,<br>
38. As another alternative, the center ring'34 may be stationary with respect to the<br>
applier 10, with controls effective to move the proximal and distal rings 32, 36<br>
inwardly to the center ring 34.<br>
{0030| In FIG. 3, ihe unactuated ring device 30 is shown with the distal introducer tip<br>
18 of the applier 10. The ring device 10 may be comprised of a single piece of molded<br>
or stamped materi il. For instance, the ring device 10 may be advantageously formed<br>
from a stamped pi jce of sheet metal that is wound around a mandrel and tack welded<br>
into a cylindrical fhape. Cuts define the arms 38, 40 and creases define the hinged<br>
portions. Similar manufacturing economies may be achieved by molding the ring<br>
device 30 from a polymeric material. Furthermore, the device 10 may be formed<br>
entirely or partial! / of a biofragmentable or absorbable material to assist in the<br>
eventual passing cf the device 10, leaving a patent anastomosis. The ring device 10<br>
may advantageously include radiopaque markers in the arms to allow diagnostic<br>
imaging to confirm placement of the device 10 and/or to confirm passing. It should be<br>
appreciated that the afore-described methods of manufacture are believed to yield<br>
economical and therapeutic advantages; however, other techniques for fabrication and<br>
assembly may be employed.<br>
100311 Also depicted in FIG. 3, a center ring actuating member 62 and a distal ring<br>
actuating member 64 are shown that move within the shaft 56 in response to the<br>
center and distal ring slide controls 58, 60. In the illustrative version, each actuating<br>
member 62, 64 is brmed from a rigid polymer or sheet metal to have two parallel<br>
elongate prongs 6, 68 springedly outwardly biased or urged outwardly by other<br>
portions of the applier 10 to present distally and laterally presented catches 70 to the<br>
inner surface of th ;ir respective rings for engagement. Proximal to each catch 70 is a<br>
releasing ramp 72 that causes the catch 70 to move inwardly as the releasing ramp 72<br>
contacts the next more proximal nng at or near full actuation. Thus, the ring device 30<br>
is disengaged from the actuating portion 24 of the applier 10 and may be deployed.<br>
[0032| In FIGS 4 5, the actuating members 62, 64 are depicted as having moved<br>
proximally to art intermediate locking position. The shaft 56 (shown in phantom) has<br>
restrained the pro imal ring 32 while center ring actuating member 62 has drawn back<br>
the center ring 34 ;uch that the proximal arms 38 have partially actuated. Similarly,<br>
the distal ring actuating member 64 has drawn back the distal ring 36 such that the<br>
relative distance between the distal and center 36, 34 is sufficient to also partially<br>
actuate the distal srms 40. A locking mechanism, depicted as proximally directed<br>
locking hook 74, i; connected to the distal ring 36 and is depicted as transitioning past<br>
the center ring 34 at this intermediate actuating position. It may be desired in some<br>
applications for thsre to be sufficient interference or latching at intermediate points<br>
during actuation for the nng device 30 to remain in a partially actuated position.<br>
[0033| In FIGS. 6-7, the ring device 30 has fully actuated. In FIG 6, the actuating<br>
members 62, 64 h ive caused the locking hook 74 to lock the distal ring 36 to the<br>
proximal ring 32. It should be appreciated that this simple latching mechanism is<br>
illustrative and for clarity. A distally presented hook from the proximal ring 32 for<br>
instance may inteimediately latch to the center ring 34 when the proximal arms 38 are<br>
partially actuated ind latch to the distal ring 36 when the proximal arms 38 are fully<br>
actuated. In FIG. ', the applier 10 has been withdrawn from the ring device 30. An<br>
advantage of haviig the locking hook exposed in the proximal lumen is convenient<br>
access for confim ing latching and for reversing the closing of the device 30 in<br>
instances when: a leak is detected after actuation (e.g., from the opening 20 out<br>
between the tissue walls 14, 16).<br>
10034] In use, a nng device 30 is received upon an actuating portion 24 of an<br>
implement portioi. 12 of an applier 10. Specifically, the proximal ring 32 of the device<br>
30 rests against the shaft 56, a center ring actuating member 62 engages the center<br>
ring 34 of the dev ce 30, and a distal ring actuating member 64 engages the distal nng<br>
36 of the device 30. A clinician manipulates the handle 54 to insert the implement<br>
portion 12 throng l the cannula of a trocar, laparoscopic port, or through a lumen such<br>
as the esophagus io the anastomosis site 22. The tissue walls 14, 16 are proximately<br>
placed and the introducer tip 18 of the implement portion 12 passes through the<br>
opening 20 formed in these walls 14, 16. The introducer tip may include a piercing<br>
shape and/or electromagnetically or thermally enhanced cutting features to assist in<br>
forming the opening 20. Once the distal arms 40 of the device 30 are in the distal<br>
lumen, the distal ung slide control 60 may be proximally moved to actuate the distal<br>
arms into a pama ly actuated ring shape, latching the locking hook 74 to the center<br>
ring 34. The distal tissue wall 16 thus held may be drawn back proximally if<br>
necessary such th it the proximal arms 38 reside within the first lumen. Drawing back<br>
the center ring slide control 58 thus partially actuates the proximal arms 38. If the<br>
positioning is correct, the slide controls 58, 60 may be fully slid, latching the locking<br>
hook 74 to the proximal ring and causing the proximal and distal arms 38,40 to be<br>
fully actuated and disengaging the catches 70 that hold the applier 10 to the ring<br>
device 30. Then, ihe distal tip 18 of the applier is withdrawn from the ring device 30<br>
leaving it deployed to form the anastomotic attachment. Over time, the tissue walls<br>
14, 16 permanent y heal together and the ring device 30 may be passed out of the<br>
digestive tract, especially if biofragmentable.<br>
(0035) While the present invention has been illustrated by description of several<br>
embodiments and while the illustrative embodiments have been described in<br>
considerable dcta: 1, it is not the intention of the applicant to restrict or in any way<br>
limit the scope of the appended claims to such detail. Additional advantages and<br>
modifications may readily appear to those skilled in the art<br>
f0036| For example, aspects of the invention have application to surgical procedures<br>
performed endoscopically and laparoscopically, as well as an open procedure. Use<br>
herein of one of these or similar terms should not be construed to limit the present<br>
invention for use n only one category of surgical procedure.<br>
f0037| For another example, although bariatric procedures for bypassing portions of a<br>
gastrointestinal tract arc depicted, it should be appreciated that other surgical<br>
procedures may benefit by an anastomotic ring device having aspects described<br>
herein, such as for the bile duct and vascular bypasses.<br>
[0038| As an acldi tonal example, instead of a center ring 34, the proximal arms 38<br>
may attach to the distal arms 40 in an accordion-like fashion with the proximal ring<br>
32 locking to the c istal ring 36. Thus, the center portion of the device 30 at the tissue<br>
junction is capable of dilating, thereby further stabilizing the lumens to be<br>
anastomosed and preventing tissue slippage. This dilation may be effected either by<br>
the proximal and distal rings 32, 36 forcing a center portion to dilate with a wedging<br>
action or by making the inner arm segments 46-48 shorter than the outer arm<br>
segments 50-52.<br>
I0039| As yet a further example, the rings 32, 34, 36 present an internally projecting<br>
contour that may be engaged by the catches 70 of the applier. Other engagements may-<br>
be incorporated, sich as a frangible adhesion between actuating members and one or<br>
more rings. In addition, a distal introducer tip may act as an anvil that may be<br>
withdrawn proxin ally to longitudinally compress the device, with features that may<br>
be radially withdrawn to thereafter allow the distal introducer tip to be removed from<br>
the ring device foi deployment.<br>
[0040] As yet another example, pads on the inner arm segments may be included to<br>
control the pressu e profile on the tissue. Corners may be softened or smoothed to<br>
avoid any adverse effects of a traumatic contact to tissue.<br>
