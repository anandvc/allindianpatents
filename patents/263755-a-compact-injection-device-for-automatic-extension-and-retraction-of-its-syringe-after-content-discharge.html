Background Technology<br>
The present invention relates to an injection device of the type that receives a syringe,<br>
extends it, discharges its contents and then retracts it automatically. Devices of this<br>
general description arc shown in WO 95/35126 and EP-A-0 516 473 and tend to<br>
employ a drive spring and some form of release mechanism that releases the syringe<br>
from the influence of the drive spring once its contents are supposed to have been<br>
discharged, to allow it to be retracted by a return spring.<br>
Because of the stack-up of tolerances of the various components of the device, a<br>
certain margin of safety must be built into the activation of the release mechanism, to<br>
ensure that it is effective. The consequence of underestimating the safety margin is<br>
that the release mechanism may fail to operate even once the syringe contents have<br>
been discharged, which is unsatisfactory in a device that is supposed to retract<br>
automatically, particularly for self-administered drugs. On the other hand,<br>
overestimating the safety margin may mean that some of the syringe contents arc<br>
discharged after the syringe has retracted, which results firstly in a short dose and<br>
secondly in what may be termed a "wet" injection. Wet injections are undesirable for<br>
the squeamish, particularly in connection with self-administered drugs.<br>
UK patent applications nos. 0210123, 0229384 and 0325596 describe a series of<br>
injection devices designed to deal with this problem. Each makes use of a neat trick<br>
that delays the release of the syringe for a certain period of time after the release<br>
mechanism has been activated, in an attempt to ensure that the syringe has been<br>
completely discharged. The devices illustrated in UK patent application no. 0325596<br>
make use of a two-part drive incorporating a fluid-damped delay mechanism that is<br>
particularly effective in ensuring complete discharge of the syringe contents. In each<br>
case, the device relies upon two unlatching mechanisms. The first unlatching<br>
mechanism initiates the fluid damping mechanism and the second releases the syringe<br>
from the actuator, allowing it to be withdrawn. The unlatching mechanisms are<br>
activated by components of the injection device having been advanced to nominal<br>
unlatching positions relative to the device casework.<br>
A device 10 of this general character is illustrated schematically in figure 1. The<br>
sequence of operation is as follows. Firstly, the device 10 is armed. The user presses a<br>
release button and the syringe 14 is advanced a distance d, by a drive spring 30, thereby<br><br>
compressing the retraction spring 26. This movement inserts the needle 18 into the<br>
patient. The plunger 23 is advanced a distance d2 by the drive spring 30, injecting most<br>
of the dose. Once nearly the entire dose has been injected, the first unlatching<br>
mechanism is activated, an operation illustrated schematically by the coincidence of<br>
components 1 and 3. The plunger 23 is then advanced a further distance d3 by the drive<br>
spring 30, injecting the rest of the dose. Finally, the second unlatching mechanism is<br>
activated, an operation illustrated schematically by the coincidence of components 2<br>
and 4, and the retraction spring 26 then causes the needle 18 to be retracted by the<br>
distance d|.<br>
Since the drive spring acts upon the same component of the device throughout, here<br>
referred to as the "actuator", the distance that component must move between the device<br>
being armed and the second unlatching mechanism being activated is, subject to<br>
tolerance stack-up, equal to the sum of d1, D2 and d3. In the devices described in the<br>
applications mentioned above, all of this movement takes place to the rear of the syringe,<br>
which means that the overall length of the device must be greater than the sum of the<br>
length of the actuator, the distances d1, d2, and d3, and the length of the syringe body not<br>
including the needle.<br>
The best design of injection device is one that is compact. This is important both to the<br>
ergonomics of the device and to its manufactured cost. The length of the device can be<br>
reduced by allowing the actuator to move past the syringe, and by having the unlatching<br>
mechanisms activated in front of the syringe. However, this would require the actuator<br>
and its unlatching mechanisms to pass around the space occupied by the syringe,<br>
involving an increase in diameter of the device that negates the length savings.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide a more compact device. Instead of<br>
triggering release of the unlatching mechanisms using a fixed point on the device<br>
casework, the present invention does it using one of more features that move forward<br>
with the syringe as it is advanced. In other words, the nominal positions at which the<br>
unlatching mechanisms are activated are defined relative to the syringe, not relative to<br>
the device casework. As illustrated in figure 2, these nominal positions also move<br><br>
forwards a distance d1 as the syringe is initially advanced. This in turn means that the<br>
initial distance between the actuator and the syringe plunger can be reduced by the<br>
distance d1. The length of the device can be reduced by d1 at a stroke. More modest<br>
improvements arc available when only one of the nominal positions at which the<br>
unlatching mechanisms are activated is defined relative to the syringe.<br>
Accordingly, a first aspect of the present invention provides an injection device<br>
comprising:<br>
a housing adapted to receive a syringe having a discharge nozzle;<br>
first and second drive elements, of which the first is acted upon and the second<br>
acts upon the syringe to advance it from its retracted position to its extended position<br>
and discharge its contents through the discharge nozzle, the first drive element being<br>
capable of movement relative to the second when the former is acted upon and the<br>
latter is restrained by the syringe;<br>
a coupling that prevents the first drive element from moving relative to the<br>
second until they have been advanced to a nominal decoupling position relative to the<br>
syringe.<br>
In this case, the nominal decoupling position, i.e. the first nominal unlatching<br>
position, is defined relative to the syringe and not relative to the housing.<br>
Preferably, the device includes:<br>
an actuator that acts upon the first drive element;<br>
means for biasing the syringe from an extended position in which the<br>
discharge nozzle extends from the housing to a retracted position in which the<br>
discharge nozzle is contained within the housing; and<br>
a release mechanism, activated when the first drive element has been advanced<br>
to a nominal release position that is more advanced than the said nominal decoupling<br>
position, and adapted to release the syringe from the action of the actuator, whereupon<br>
the biasing means restores the syringe to its retracted position.<br><br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the nominal decoupling position is defined<br>
either by one of the drive elements interacting with a decoupling component that<br>
moves with the syringe as it is advanced.<br>
For ease of manufacture and assembly, the coupling may comprise flexible arms on<br>
one of the drive elements that engage with a drive surface on the other, in which case<br>
the decoupling component causes the flexible arms to move when the said nominal<br>
decoupling position is reached, thus disengaging them from the drive surface to allow<br>
the first drive element to move relative to the second.<br>
A second aspect of the present invention provides an injection device comprising:<br>
a housing adapted to receive a syringe having a discharge nozzle, the housing<br>
including means for biasing the syringe from an extended position in which the<br>
discharge nozzle extends from the housing to a retracted position in which the<br>
discharge nozzle is contained within the housing;<br>
first and second drive elements, of which the first is acted upon and the second<br>
acts upon the syringe to advance it from its retracted position to its extended position<br>
and discharge its contents through the discharge nozzle, the first drive element being<br>
capable of movement relative to the second when the former is acted upon and the<br>
latter is restrained by the syringe;<br>
a coupling that prevents the first drive element from moving relative to the<br>
second until they have been advanced to a nominal decoupling position; and<br>
a release mechanism, activated when the first drive element has been advanced<br>
to a nominal release position relative to the syringe that is more advanced than the<br>
said nominal decoupling position, and adapted to release the syringe, whereupon the<br>
biasing means restores the syringe to its retracted position.<br>
Mere, the nominal release position, i.e. the second nominal unlatching position, is<br>
defined relative to the syringe and not relative to the housing.<br>
Again, in preferred embodiments, the nominal release position is defined by an<br>
actuator or the first drive element interacting with a decoupling component that moves<br>
with the syringe as it is advanced. It may be defined by the actuator interacting with<br><br>
the first drive element once the nominal decoupling position has been reached, at<br>
which position the first drive element is restrained by the syringe against further<br>
movement.<br>
Once again, for case of manufacture and assembly, of the actuator and the first drive<br>
element, one preferably comprises second flexible arms that engage with a second<br>
drive surface on the other, and the release mechanism preferably comprises the said<br>
decoupling component, which causes the second flexible arms to move when the said<br>
nominal release position is reached, thus disengaging them from the drive surface.<br>
Alternatively, of an actuator and the first drive element, one preferably comprises<br>
second flexible arms that engage with a second drive surface on the other, allowing<br>
the actuator to act upon the first drive element and preventing the former from moving<br>
relative to the latter until the nominal release position has been reached, the second<br>
flexible arms are preferably biased toward a position at which they engage the second<br>
drive surface and the release mechanism preferably causes them to move against their<br>
bias, thus disengaging them from the drive surface.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
figures 1 and 2 are schematic illustrations to which reference has already been<br>
made;<br>
Figure 3 is an illustration of a first embodiment of the invention; and<br>
Figure 4 is likewise a second.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
Figure 3 shows an injection device 110 in which a housing 112 contains a hypodermic<br>
syringe 1 14. The syringe 114 is of conventional type, including a syringe body 116<br>
terminating at one end in a hypodermic needle 118 and at the other in a flange 120.<br>
The conventional plunger that would normally be used to discharge the contents of<br>
the syringe 114 manually has been removed and replaced with a drive element 134 as<br>
will be described below, to which is attached a bung 122. The bung 122 constrains a<br><br>
drug 124 to be administered within the syringe body 116. Whilst the syringe<br>
illustrated is of hypodermic type, this need not necessarily be so. Transcutaneous or<br>
ballistic dermal and subcutaneous syringes may also be used with the injection device<br>
of the present invention. Generally, the syringe must include a discharge nozzle,<br>
which in a hypodermic syringe is the needle 118.<br>
As illustrated, the housing includes a return spring 126 that biases the syringe 114<br>
from an extended position in which the needle 118 extends from an aperture 128 in<br>
the housing 112 to a retracted position in which the discharge nozzle 118 is contained<br>
within the housing 112. The return spring 126 acts on the syringe 114 via a sleeve<br>
127.<br>
At the other end of the housing is a compression drive spring 130. Drive from the<br>
drive spring 130 is transmitted via a multi-component drive to the syringe 114 to<br>
advance it from its retracted position to its extended position and discharge its<br>
contents through the needle 118. The drive accomplishes this task by acting directly<br>
on the drug 124 and the syringe 114. Hydrostatic forces acting through the drug 124<br>
and. to a lesser extent, static friction between the bung 122 and the syringe body 116<br>
initially ensure that they advance together, until the return spring 126 bottoms out or<br>
the syringe body 116 meets some other obstruction that retards its motion.<br>
The multi-component drive between the drive spring 130 and the syringe 114 consists<br>
of three principal components. A drive sleeve 131 takes drive from the drive spring<br>
130 and transmits it to flexible latch arms 133 on a first drive element 132. This in<br>
turn transmits drive via flexible latch arms 135 to a second drive element, the drive<br>
element 134 already mentioned.<br>
The first drive element 132 includes a hollow stem 140, the inner cavity of which<br>
forms a collection chamber 142 in communication with a vent 144 that extends from<br>
the collection chamber through the end of the stem 140. The second drive element<br>
134 includes a blind bore 146 that is open at one end to receive the stem 140 and<br>
closed at the other. As can be seen, the bore 146 and the stem 140 define a fluid<br>
reservoir 148, within which a damping fluid is contained.<br><br>
A trigger (not shown) is provided on one side of the housing 112. The trigger, when<br>
operated, serves to decouple the drive sleeve 131 from the housing 112, allowing it to<br>
move relative to the housing 112 under the influence of the drive spring 130. The<br>
operation of the device is then as follows.<br>
Initially, the drive spring 130 moves the drive sleeve 131, the drive sleeve 131 moves<br>
the first drive element 132 and the first drive element 132 moves the second drive<br>
element 134. in each case by acting through the flexible latch arms 133, 135. The<br>
second drive element 134 and the bung 122 move and, by virtue of static friction and<br>
hydrostatic forces acting through the drug 124 to be administered, move the syringe<br>
body 116 against the action of the return spring 126. The return spring 126<br>
compresses and the hypodermic needle 118 emerges from the exit aperture 128 of the<br>
housing 112. This continues until the return spring 126 bottoms out or the syringe<br>
body 116 meets some other obstruction that retards its motion. Because the static<br>
friction between the bung 122 and the syringe body 116 and the hydrostatic forces<br>
acting through the drug 124 to be administered are not sufficient to resist the full drive<br>
force developed by the drive spring 130, at this point the second drive element 134<br>
begins to move within the syringe body 116 and the drug 124 begins to be discharged.<br>
Dynamic friction between the bung 122 and the syringe body 116 and hydrostatic<br>
forces acting through the drug 124 to be administered are, however, sufficient to<br>
retain the return spring 126 in its compressed state, so the hypodermic needle 118<br>
remains extended.<br>
Before the second drive element 134 reaches the end of its travel within the syringe<br>
body 116, so before the contents of the syringe have fully discharged, the flexible<br>
latch arms 135 linking the first and second drive elements 132, 134 reach a<br>
constriction 137. The constriction 137 is formed by a component 162 that is attached<br>
to the syringe flange 120, so it will be understood that when the syringe 114 advances<br>
from its retracted position to its extended position, the component 162 advances with<br>
it. The constriction 137 moves the flexible latch arms 135 inwards from the position<br>
shown to a position at which they no longer couple the first drive element 136 to the<br>
second drive element 134, aided by the bevelled surfaces on the constriction 137.<br><br>
Once this happens, the first drive element 136 acts no longer on the second drive<br>
element 134, allowing the first drive element 132 to move relative to the second drive element 134.<br>
Because the damping fluid is contained within a reservoir 148 defined between the<br>
end of the first drive element 132 and the blind bore 146 in the second drive element<br>
134, the volume of the reservoir 148 will tend to decrease as the first drive element<br>
132 moves relative to the second drive element 134 when the former is acted upon by<br>
the drive spring 130. As the reservoir 148 collapses, damping fluid is forced through<br>
the vent 144 into the collection chamber 142. Thus, once the flexible latch arms 135<br>
have been released, the force exerted by the drive spring 130 does work on the<br>
damping fluid, causing it to flow through the constriction formed by the vent 144, and<br>
also acts hydroslatically through the fluid, to drive the second drive element 134.<br>
Losses associated with the flow of the damping fluid do not attenuate the force acting<br>
on the body of the syringe to a great extent. Thus, the return spring 126 remains<br>
compressed and the hypodermic needle 118 remains extended.<br>
After a time, the second drive element 134 completes its travel within the syringe<br>
body 116 and can go no further. At this point, the contents of the syringe 114 are<br>
completely discharged and the force exerted by the drive spring 130 acts to retain the<br>
second drive element 134 in its terminal position and to continue to cause the<br>
damping fluid to How through the vent 144, allowing the first drive element 132 to<br>
continue its movement.<br>
Before the reservoir 148 of fluid is exhausted, the flexible latch arms 133 linking the<br>
drive sleeve 131 with the first drive element 132 reach another constriction 139, also<br>
provided by the component 162 that is attached to the syringe flange 120. The<br>
constriction 139 moves the flexible latch arms 133 inwards from the position shown<br>
to a position at which they no longer couple the drive sleeve 131 to the first drive<br>
element 132, aided by the bevelled surfaces on the constriction 139. Once this<br>
happens, the drive sleeve 131 acts no longer on the first drive element 132, allowing<br>
them to move relative to each other. At this point, of course, the syringe 114 is<br>
released, because the force developed by the drive spring 130 is no longer being<br><br>
226 bottoms out or the syringe body 216 meets some other obstruction that retards its<br>
motion.<br>
The multi component drive between the drive spring 230 and the syringe 214 again<br>
consists of three principal components. The drive sleeve 231 takes drive from the<br>
drive spring 230 and transmits it to flexible latch arms 233 on a first drive element<br>
232. These elements are shown in detail "A". The first drive element 232 in turn<br>
transmits drive via flexible latch arms 235 to a second drive element 234. These<br>
elements are shown in detail "B'\ As before, the first drive element 232 includes a<br>
hollow stem 240, the inner cavity of which forms a collection chamber 242. The<br>
second drive element 234 includes a blind for 246 that is open at one end to receive<br>
the stem 240 and closed at the other. As can be seen, the bore 246 and the stem 240<br>
define a fluid reservoir 248, within which a damping fluid is contained.<br>
A trigger (not shown) is provided in the middle of the housing 212. The trigger, one<br>
operated, serves to decouple the drive sleeve 231 from the housing 212 allowing it to<br>
move relative to the housing 212 under the influence of the drive spring 230. The<br>
operation of the device is then as follows.<br>
Initially, the drive spring 230 moves the drive sleeve 231, the drive sleeve 231 moves<br>
the first drive element 232 and the first drive element 232 moves the second drive<br>
element 234, in each case by acting through the flexible matching arms 233, 235. The<br>
second drive element 234 moves and, by virtue of static friction and hydrostatic forces<br>
acting through the drug 224 to be administered, moves the syringe body 216 against<br>
the action of the return spring 226. The return spring 226 compresses and the<br>
hypodermic needle 218 emerges from the exit aperture 228 of the housing 212. This<br>
continues until the return spring 226 bottoms out or the syringe body 216 meets some<br>
other obstruction that retards its motion. Because the static friction between the bung<br>
222 and the syringe body 216 and the hydrostatic forces acting through the drug 224<br>
to be administered are not sufficient to resist the full drive force developed by the<br>
drive spring 230, at this point the second drive element 234 begins to move within the<br>
syringe body 216 and the drug 224 begins to be discharged. Dynamic friction between<br>
the bung 222 and the syringe body 216 and hydrostatic forces acting through the drug<br><br>
224 to be administered are, however, sufficient to retain the return spring 226 in its<br>
compressed state, so the hypodermic needle 218 remains extended.<br>
Before the second drive element 234 reaches the end of its travel within the syringe<br>
body 216, so before the contents of the syringe have fully discharged, the flexible<br>
latch arms 235 linking the first and second drive elements 232, 234 reach a<br>
constriction 237. The constriction 237 is formed by a component 262 that is attached<br>
to the syringe carrier. Additional flexible arms 247 overlie the flexible arms 235 on<br>
the first drive element 232, by means of which drive is transmitted to the second drive<br>
element 234. Figure 4 illustrates the injection device 210 at the position where the<br>
additional flexible arms 247 are just making contact with the constriction 237 in the<br>
component 262.<br>
The constriction 237 moves the additional flexible arms 247 inwards, aided by the<br>
bevelled surfaces on both, and the additional flexible arms 247 in turn move the<br>
flexible arms 235. by means of which drive is transmitted from the first drive element<br>
232 to the second drive element 234, inwards from the position shown to a position at<br>
which they no longer couple the first and second drive elements together. Once this<br>
happens, the first drive element 232 acts no longer on the second drive element 234,<br>
allowing the first drive element 232 to move relative to the second drive element 234.<br>
Because the damping fluid is contained within a reservoir 248 defined between the<br>
end of the first drive element 232 and the blind bore 246 in the second drive element<br>
234, the volume of the reservoir 248 will tend to decrease as the first drive element<br>
232 moves relative to the second drive element 234 when the former is acted upon by<br>
the drive spring 230. As the reservoir 248 collapses, damping fluid is forced into the<br>
collection chamber 242. Thus, once the flexible latch arms 235 have been released,<br>
the force exerted by the drive spring 230 does work on the damping fluid, causing it<br>
to flow into the collection chamber 242, and also acts hydrostatically through the<br>
fluid, thence via the second drive element 234. Losses associated with the flow of the<br>
damping fluid do not attenuate the force acting on the body of the syringe to a great<br>
extent. Thus, the return spring 226 remains compressed and the hypodermic needle<br>
remains extended.<br><br>
Alter a time, the second drive element 234 completes its travel within the syringe<br>
body 216 and can go no further. At this point, the contents of the syringe 214 are<br>
completely discharged and the force exerted by the drive spring 230 acts to retain the<br>
second drive element 234 in its terminal position and to continue to cause the<br>
damping fluid to How into the collection chamber 142, allowing the first drive<br>
element 232 to continue its movement.<br>
A flange 270 on the rear of the second drive element 234 normally retains the flexible<br>
arms 233 in engagement with the drive sleeve 231. However, before the reservoir 248<br>
of fluid is exhausted, the flexible latch arms 233 linking the drive sleeve 231 with the<br>
first drive element 232 move sufficiently far forward relative to the second drive<br>
element 234 that the flange 270 is brought to register with a rebate 272 in the flexible<br>
arms 233. whereupon it ceases to be effective in retaining the flexible arms 233 in<br>
engagement with the drive sleeve 231. Now, the drive sleeve 231 moves the flexible<br>
latch arms 233 inwards from the position shown to a position at which they no longer<br>
couple the drive sleeve 231 to the first drive element 232, aided by the bevelled<br>
latching surfaces 274 on the flexible arms 233. Once this happens, the drive sleeve<br>
231 acts no longer on the first drive element 232, allowing them to move relative to<br>
each other. At this point, of course, the syringe 214 is released, because the forces<br>
developed by the drive spring 230 are no longer being transmitted to the syringe 214,<br>
and the only force acting on the syringe will be the return force from the return spring<br>
226. Thus, the syringe 214 now returns to its retracted position and the injection cyele<br>
is complete.<br><br>
