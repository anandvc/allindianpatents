GRANTED<br>
8-6-2005<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku,   Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
[Detailed Description Of The Invention]<br>
[0001]<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to improvement to an exhaust muffler for a vehicle having flange sections facing an inner surface of a cylindrical casing provided on the outside of separation plates pluraily dividing up the inside of the cylindrical casing, with a plurality of places spaced in a peripheral direction of the flange sections being welded to the casing. [0002] [Related Art]<br>
Conventionally, an exhaust muffler is already known, as disclosed in Japanese Patent Publication No. Sho. 56-50095. [0003] [Problems To Be Solved By The Invention]<br>
However, with the above described exhaust muffler of the related art, flange sections are provided on the outside of spacing plates, have a uniform width on all areas thereof and come into contact with the whole inner surface of the casing. Because of this, the flange sections come into contact with the inner surface of the casing at a comparatively large contact area even at sections other than weld sites, it is difficult to get paint to slick when performing inner surface coating, and it easy for pre-processing fluid at the time of plating processing and water entering into the casing when washing the vehicle to stick to the flange sections and between the flange sections at sections other than the weld sites, which causes rust to arise in the casing. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been conceived in view of the above described situation, and has as its object to provide an exhaust muffler for a vehicle with a casing having good<br><br><br>
sticking of paint to the casing at sections corresponding to flange sections of spacing plates,<br>
and that significantly reduces the build up of water to significantly prevent rust arising in the<br>
casing.<br>
[0005]<br>
[Means of Solving The problems]<br>
In order to achieve the above mentioned object, the present invention provides an exhaust muffler for a vehicle having flange sections facing an inner surface of a cylindrical casing provided on the outside of separation plates pluraliy dividing up the inside of the cylindrical casing, with a plurality of places spaced in a peripheral direction of the flange sections being welded to the casing, wherein the flange sections comprise a plurality of weld sites for welding to the inner surface of the casing, and connecting non-weld sites between each of the weld sites having a width along an axis of the casing smaller than each of the weld sites. [0006]<br>
With this type of structure, it is possible to set a surface area opposite the non-weld sites in the flange sections of the spacing plates extremelysmall, and accordingly it is made easy for paint to stick to the casing at sections corresponding to flange sections of the spacing plates at the time of inner surface coating, and it is difficult for water that has entered into the casing to accumulate between the flange sections and the casing making it possible to significantly prevent the occurrence of rust in the casing.<br><br><br>

A connection is made between each of the non-weld sections 29b2... and the circular plate 29a through sloping surfaces 29c... sloping so as to approach the circular plate 29a and move away from the casing 23. [0025]<br>
Also, indented portions are formed in the lowest non welding sites 27b2, 28b2 and 29b2 of the flange sections 27b, 28b and 29b each of the spacing plates 27, 28 and 29 so as to form drainage holes 52, 53, 5,4 between the inner surface of the casing 23. [0026]<br>
Next, operation of the first embodiment will be described. The flange sections 27b, 28b and 29b provided with spacing plates 27, 28 and 29, for dividing the inside of the casing 23, on an outer periphery, comprise weld sites 27b,...., 28b,..., and 29b|... welded to the inside of the casing 23, and non-weld sites 27b2..., 28b2..., and 29b2... connecting between each of the weld sites 27b1|...., 28b1..., and 29b1,..., and widths W1 of the non-weld sites 27b2..., 28b2.., and 29b2,... along the axis of the casing 23 is set to be smaller than the width W2 of the weld sites 27b1...., 28b1..., and 29b1,.... [0027]<br>
Accordingly, with respect to the flange sections 27b, 28b and 29b it is possible to set a contact surface area of the non-weld sites 23 27b2..., 28b2.., and 29b2...facing the casing extremely small. As a result, it is possible to make paint stick well to the casing 23 at sections corresponding to each of the flange sections 27b, 28b and 29b when coating the inner surface, and to make it difficult to enter into the casing 23 to accumulate between the flange sections 27b, 28b and 29b and the casing 23, thus making it possible to significantly prevent rust arising in the casing 23. [0028]<br>
Fig. 11 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. Non-weld sites 27b2... within the flange sections 27b on the outside of the spacing plate 27 are formed so that they do not contact the inner surface of the casing 23, maintaining a slight gap between the spacing plate 27 and the casing 23, and the other spacing plates 28 and 29 (refer to the first embodiment) have a similar structure to that of the spacing plate 27. [0029]<br>
According to the second embodiment, a surface area of the non-weld sites 27b2 facing the casing 23 is made small, and the non-weld sites 27b2 do not touch the casing 23. This<br><br><br>
means that it is possible to make paint stick more effectively to the casing 23 at sections corresponding to the flange section 27b when coating the inner surface, and it possible to more effectively avoid water entering into the casing 23 accumulating between the flange section 27b and the casing 23, thus making it possible to more effectively prevent rust arising in the casing 23. [0030]<br>
Embodiments of the present invention have been described above, but the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and various design changes are possible without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. [0031] [Effects of the Invention]<br>
According to the above described invention, it is possible to set a surface area of the non-weld sites, within the flange sections of the spacing plates, facing the casing small, it is made easy for paint to stick to the casing at sections corresponding to the flange sections when coaling the inner surface, and it is made difficult for water entering into the casing to accumulate between the flange sections and the casing, thus significantly preventing rust arising in the casing 23.<br><br><br>
