				<td>IMPROVED OZONE STERILIZATION METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to methods of sterilization, in particular, methods of sterilization using<br>
humidified ozone.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sterilization is the destruction of any virus, bacteria, fungus or other micro-organism, whether<br>
in a vegetative or in a dormant spore state. Conventional sterilization processes for medical<br>
instruments have involved high temperatures (such as steam and dry heat units) or toxic<br>
chemicals (such as ethylene oxide gas, EtO). Steam sterilization with an autoclave has been<br>
the time-honoured method of sterilization. It is fast and cost effective. However, the autoclave<br>
destroys heat-sensitive instruments. Thus, since more and more heat-sensitive instruments<br>
such as arthroscopes and endoscopes are used in medical treatment, other types of sterilization<br>
are needed, especially cold sterilization.<br>
Ethylene oxide may be used to cold sterilize heat-sensitive instruments. However, it has now<br>
been deemed by national health and safety organizations to be carcinogenic and neurotoxic.<br>
It also poses flammability problems and is thus usually used in combination with<br>
chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) which themselves are now undesirable. Further, sterilization<br>
with ethylene oxide takes 14 to 36 hours.<br>
A more efficient, safer, and less expensive sterilization agent is ozone (O3). Ozone, especially<br>
humidified ozone, is a sterilizing gas. Ozone can easily be generated from oxygen, especially<br>
hospital grade oxygen. Oxygen is readily available in the hospital environment, usually from<br>
a wall or ceiling oxygen source, or, if mobility is required, from a portable "J" cylinder of<br>
oxygen.<br>
Ozone is widely used in industry as an oxidising agent to bleach paper pulp, treat drinking<br>
water, and sterilize sewage water and food products. The amounts (concentrations) of ozone<br>
required in the sterilization gas for water purification are low, generally less than 40 mg /I<br>
(milligram per litre). However, higher concentrations, combined with critical humidity levels,<br>
are required to make ozone an effective sterilant of micro-organisms. Those high<br>
concentrations of ozone gas have to be combined with critical levels of humidity. The<br>
sterilization efficiency of ozone increases rapidly with increased relative humidity. A high<br>
relative humidity is required for ozone to penetrate the protective shells of micro-organisms.<br>
The presence of water vapour will also accelerate ozone reactions with organic substances.<br>
Sufficient relative humidity further helps the penetration of sterilization packaging by ozone.<br>
Sterilization with ozone is more efficient and quicker than with EtO and requires few changes<br>
in user habits. Moreover, ozone-based processes are compatible for use with current<br>
packaging, such as sterile pouches and rigid containers.<br>
Ozone sterilization requires substantially no aeration or cooling down of sterilized<br>
instruments, which can be used immediately following sterilization. This allows hospitals to<br>
reduce the cost of maintaining expensive medical device inventories. Ozone sterilization<br>
offers several other advantages. It produces no toxic waste, does not require the handling of<br>
dangerous gas cylinders, and poses no threat to the environment or the user's health. Stainless-<br>
steel instruments and heat-sensitive instruments can be treated simultaneously, which for<br>
some users will obviate the need for two separate sterilizers.<br>
Canadian Patent Number 2,149,133 (Childers) is one of many references dealing with<br>
sterilization using hydrogen peroxide as the sterilant. This reference gives no useful assistance<br>
on ozone sterilization.<br>
Ozone sterilization is discussed in United States application 2002/00859590 (Robitaille).<br>
It is recognized in this reference that condensation can present a barrier to the ozone, and thus<br>
to effect the sterilization. However, the only approach contemplated in this reference is to<br>
ensure temperature equalization of all components before starting the sterilization procedure.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,719,017 discloses the use of a mixture of ozone gas with a very fine water<br>
mist in. a sealed plastic bag container which contains an article to be sterilized. The method<br>
involves repeated evacuation and refilling of the plastic bag with a mixture of ozone gas and<br>
a very fine water mist. The air in the bag is exhausted and replaced with apressurised mixture<br>
of ozone and water mist. Upon encountering the much lower pressure within the bag, the<br>
water particles from the pressurised mixture explode, forming a water mist. However, this<br>
system cannot generate a sufficiently high water vapour concentration to provide the high<br>
relative humidity required for thorough sterilization (at least 85% relative humidity).<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,069,880 describes a device capable of generating a relative humidity of<br>
85%. In the apparatus the ozone is bubbled through a water bath to increase the water content<br>
of the gas. Although ozone at 85% humidity can kill most micro-organisms, it does not meet<br>
the "worst case scenario" stipulated in North American standards. Moreover, the device is<br>
unable to generate humidity levels higher than 85%. In addition, injecting ozone while<br>
humidifying the chamber increases the contact time of the ozone with the instruments to be<br>
sterilized, which may result in oxidation damage to the instruments.<br>
A minimum relative humidity level of 90% (95% ± 5%) is required to meet North American<br>
standards set by agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada.<br>
Water evaporates at 100° C at atmospheric pressure (1013 mbar or 760 Torr). Thus, various<br>
prior patents (see Faddis et al., U.S. Patents No. 5,266,275; 5,334,355; and 5,334,622) teach<br>
sterilization systems wherein water is heated to above the boiling point to evaporate the water<br>
for injection into the ozone-containing gas produced by an ozone generator. The steam is<br>
heated to 120°C. Thus, the vapour upon injection into the ozone-containing gas will have a<br>
temperature close to 100°C. However, since the decomposition of ozone increases<br>
exponentially with temperature in the range of 20 to 300°C, injecting the water vapour at a<br>
temperature of about 120°C leads to premature ozone decomposition. As a result, the<br>
effective ozone concentration in the gas produced by the ozone generator is reduced, thereby<br>
requiring significantly increased treatment times and the generation of larger amounts of<br>
ozone gas for each sterilization cycle. Thus, a more efficient and effective sterilization<br>
apparatus is desired for the sterilization of ozone at a relative humidity of above at least 90%.<br>
U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/005,786 (filed on November 8, 2001 which is a<br>
continuation-in-part application of U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 09/310,695 which was<br>
filed on May 12, 1999 and is now abandoned), which is hereby incorporated by reference,<br>
addresses these problems by applying a vacuum pressure to lower the boiling point of water<br>
below the temperature inside the sterilization chamber. Thus the teachings of this application<br>
provide an effective sterilization process.<br>
As taught in this application, it is preferred to repeat the sterilization cycle at least once to<br>
give greater assurance of effective sterilization. Thus, after loading the sterilization chamber<br>
with the articles to be sterilized (such as medical instruments), a sterilization cycle includes<br>
exposing the articles to the humidified ozone sterilant and then removing the sterilant.<br>
Repeating this cycle thus includes exposing the articles again to humidified ozone sterilant<br>
and removing the sterilant.<br>
Although this repeated sterilization method has proven very effective, technical problems<br>
have been encountered at times which reduce the efficiency of the method. It is critical that<br>
the right combination of ozone concentration and relative humidity is achieved in the<br>
sterilization process. Thus, these and other parameters which directly affect them are<br>
monitored. If values are detected which may compromise effective sterilization, the whole<br>
process is normally aborted and the procedure restarted from the beginning. Further, it has<br>
been observed that when this type of repeated sterilization cycle is used, sometimes certain<br>
components of articles to be sterilized, for example metal components such as hinges and<br>
locks with tight spaces and crevices are not adequately sterilized.<br>
The present invention seeks to reduce the number of times the sterilization process is aborted<br>
and to increase the probability of effective sterilization.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It has now been found that a modification of the abovementioned repeated sterilization cycle,<br>
by inserting at least one additional step into the process, reduces the number of times the<br>
procedure must be aborted, and also improves the effective sterilization of medical<br>
instruments subjected to the process.<br>
The improvement of the present invention is characterized by the additional step of removing<br>
any condensed water within the sterilization chamber after a sterilization cycle and, before<br>
starting a subsequent sterilization cycle.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided in a method for sterilizing<br>
an article in a sterilizing chamber by exposing the article to humidified ozone in at least two<br>
consecutive sterilizing cycles, the improvement comprising, after the first of said consecutive<br>
sterilizing cycles and before the second of said consecutive sterilizing cycles, removing from<br>
the sterilizing chamber any condensed water present.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided in a method for the<br>
sterilization of an article comprising at least two consecutive sterilization cycles, wherein the<br>
first of said consecutive cycles comprises the steps of: (a) providing a sterilization chamber,<br>
(b) placing the article into the sterilization chamber; (c) sealing the sterilization chamber, (d)<br>
maintaining the sterilization chamber operating temperature at about 20-35°C; (e) applying<br>
a vacuum of a preselected vacuum pressure to the sterilization chamber, the vacuum pressure<br>
being adjusted to a level sufficient to lower the boiling point of water to a temperature at least<br>
as low as the temperature in the sterilization chamber; (f) humidifying the sterilization<br>
chamber by exposing an amount of water to the vacuum pressure in the sterilization chamber<br>
for evaporating the water, the amount of water being selected so that the water vapour<br>
produced is sufficient to achieve a relative humidity of 90-100% in the sterilization chamber;<br>
(g) supplying ozone-containing gas to the sterilization chamber, (h) maintaining the<br>
sterilization chamber sealed for a preselected treatment period; and (i) releasing the vacuum<br>
in the sterilization chamber and the second of said at least two consecutive sterilization cycles<br>
comprising repeating at least steps (e) to (h) the improvement comprising effecting an<br>
additional step between said first and second cycle wherein the additional step comprises (j)<br>
removing any condensed water from the sterilization chamber.<br>
Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that because of the high relative<br>
humidity used, after the step of applying the humidified ozone to the chamber and its contents,<br>
some condensation may occur on the chamber floor or walls. Condensation may also occur<br>
on articles in the sterilization chamber, for example, on metal pails and components of such<br>
articles. At the start of a repeat sterilization cycle, in a initial vacuum step, such condensed<br>
water would evaporate, lowering the temperature of the sterilization chamber of articles<br>
within the chamber and thus effectively creating "cold spots". In turn, any lowering of the<br>
temperature of the chamber or its contents, thus the presence of any such "cold spots", would<br>
increase the probability of further condensation of water vapour in the next humidification<br>
step which would thus reduce the water content of the chamber and thus reduce the relative<br>
humidity so that it may fall below the target level (preferably 95%) and the sterilization<br>
procedure would have to be aborted. Further, it is presently believed that the inadequate<br>
sterilization of ceratin components of articles to be sterilized, for example metal components<br>
such as hinges and locks, was due to condensation which formed a barrier to the ozone and<br>
thus prevented adequate sterilization. By introducing at least one additional step to remove<br>
condensation, it is now believed that such components are made more accessible to the<br>
sterilizing humidified ozone in a subsequent sterilization cycle.<br>
The removal of condensed water may be referred to as a post-exposure step since it follows<br>
at least a first sterilization cycle and thus an exposure to the humidified ozone sterilant.<br>
However, it may be more appropriately referred to as a conditioning or re-conditioning step<br>
(since in preferred processes it may not be the first conditioning step and is intended to return<br>
the conditions within the chamber to conditions at least approximating those at the start of the<br>
sterilization).<br>
Removal of condensed water in the re-conditioning step is preferably accomplished by<br>
flushing the sterilization chamber with an inert gas, or a gas which can serve as a vehicle for<br>
the removal of moisture in the form of water vapour, but which will not interfere with<br>
sterilization.<br>
The preferred gas is oxygen. Although nitrogen gas is applicable, it is preferred to avoid the<br>
use of nitrogen, or nitrogen containing mixtures, such as air, since under the conditions of the<br>
sterilization process which uses ozone, a powerful oxidising agent, some nitric acid may be<br>
formed which may corrode or damage components of the medical instruments. For similar<br>
reasons, other gases, such as sulfur-containing gases, which form corrosive oxidation<br>
products, should also be avoided. Oxygen itself does not form any such corrosive compounds<br>
under the sterilization process conditions and is thus an available gas for the post-exposure<br>
step. Further, as mentioned above, oxygen sources are readily available in hospital<br>
environments where the process of the invention is likely to be most useful.<br>
Throughout this description, units of pressure will be variously indicated in mbar, Torr,<br>
atmospheres or 1/4 Torr. 1 atmosphere equals 760 Torr or 1013 mbar.<br>
One or more ventilating cycles can be added to the preferred method for removing the<br>
remaining ozone and humidity from the sterilization chamber.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will be described in more detail in the following by way of example only and<br>
with reference to the attached drawings wherein<br>
FIG. 1 is a flow diagram of a method in accordance with the invention;<br>
FIG. 2 is a graph to illustrate the sequence of steps in a method in accordance with the<br>
invention by plotting pressure against time; and<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic illustration of an apparatus suitable for use with the method of<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, the process can be regarded as including six or seven<br>
basic steps, some of which may be repeated in a second sterilization cycle.<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic representation of a sterilization process according to the invention,<br>
showing the steps of the process in sequence. Figure 2 is another representation of a process<br>
according to the invention. Figure 2 illustrates the process by showing the various steps as a<br>
function of the pressure. Thus the vertical axis shows the pressure, with atmospheric pressure<br>
represented at the top end of the vertical axis and zero pressure (or complete vacuum) at the<br>
bottom end of the vertical axis. The horizontal axis represents the sequence of steps in the<br>
process from left to right and thus corresponds to elapsed time, although not necessarily to<br>
any scale, but only for the purpose of illustration.<br>
Since the present invention is mainly concerned with the humidification step, it will be<br>
understood that details of other process steps are in the nature of preferred features which are<br>
not essential to the broadest aspects of the invention.<br>
As mentioned above, the essential steps in asterilization cycle comprise exposing instruments<br>
to be sterilized to a sterilant and removing the sterilant. When the sterilant is humidified<br>
ozone, care must be taken to ensure not only that sufficient ozone is used to effect<br>
sterilization, but that sufficient humidity exists during sterilization to maximize the effect of<br>
sterilization. The following discussion represents preferred procedures and modifications<br>
which have been found to be suitable for such a humidified ozone sterilization process.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, preferably the sterilization is preceded by a conditioning step,<br>
indicated as step 100A. This step may also be referred to as a pre-conditioning step. In this<br>
step, after inserting the articles to be sterilized in a sterilization chamber, the chamber is<br>
sealed.<br>
Generally, it is preferred to effect the sterilization at a target temperature in the range of from<br>
about 25 to 40 °C, more preferably from about 30 to 36° C and especially at around 30 °C, for<br>
example at 30.8 °C. The walls of the chamber are preferably maintained at around this<br>
sterilization temperature. Since this is above usual room temperature, it is preferred to<br>
successively fill and empty the chamber, with ambient air, in a succession of pulses. This<br>
pulsing helps stabilize the conditions in the chamber and helps bring any load (instruments<br>
to be sterilized) to the preferred chamber temperature. This is represented by the peaks and<br>
troughs shown in Figure 2 in the left-hand portion of the graph indicated as 100A, which<br>
represents the pre-conditioning step. The peaks represent a pressure of around atmospheric<br>
pressure and thus represent at least partially filling the chamber with ambient air. The troughs<br>
represent reduced pressure or evacuations of the chamber. Room temperature is usually<br>
around 18 to 22°C so to reach a target temperature of, for example, 30°C, the air must be<br>
heated. The walls of the sterilization chamber are preferably heated. Thus by pulsing a<br>
quantity of air into and out of the chamber, the temperature of the air and the temperature of<br>
the load (any instruments in the chamber for sterilization), approaches the target chamber<br>
temperature of around 30 ºC. Generally it is preferred that a reduced pressure in the range of<br>
from about 350 to about 450 Torr, more preferably about 250 Torr, is used to evacuate the<br>
chamber in each of the evacuation pulses in this pre-conditioning step. It is preferred that the<br>
ambient air load is pulsed from 7 to 16 times, more preferably ten times. However, the<br>
number of such pulses may be increased or decreased to bring the load of ambient air to a<br>
satisfactory temperature.<br>
Any inert gas may be used as the gas in the pre-conditioning step. The choice of gas will be<br>
governed by costs or by consideration of whether it will interfere with the sterilant in the<br>
subsequent sterilization steps. In later steps, it is preferred to avoid using air since the nitrogen<br>
which it contains may form harmful substances, such as nitrogen oxides as a result of the<br>
powerful oxidizing capacity of ozone. Such nitrogen oxides may then form traces of nitric<br>
acids with any water vapour and may thus damage parts, such as metal parts, of articles to be<br>
sterilized. However, in this pre-conditioning step, air can be used, although oxygen would be<br>
preferred<br>
The next step is a vacuum step and is indicated as 101 in Figures 1 and 2. In this step, gaseous<br>
contents of the sterilization chamber are evacuated. It is preferred to use a deep vacuum,<br>
generally in the range of from about 5 to 0.5 Torr, more preferably about 2.5 to 0.5 Torr, more<br>
particularly, less than 1.25 Torr to remove as much of the gaseous contents as possible. It is<br>
preferred to apply this pressure for a time in the range of from about 30 seconds to 5 minutes,<br>
more preferably about a minute to allow the pressure to stabilize within the chamber,<br>
especially considering that the articles to be sterilized may well include containers and<br>
pouches.<br>
The next step is a humidification step and is indicated as 102 in Figures 1 and 2. This step is<br>
to provide the sterilization chamber with the humidity required for sterilization. Water from<br>
a water reservoir is evaporated and introduced into the chamber as water vapour until the<br>
relative humidity is equal to or above the target value. It is preferred that the relative humidity<br>
during sterilization is at least above 90%, preferably 95% or higher. It is preferred that after<br>
the target humidity is reached, conditions are maintained to stabilize and equilibrate the<br>
conditions throughout the chamber and the articles in the chamber. Preferably conditions are<br>
maintained for a time in the range of from about 10 to 50 minutes, more preferably for at least<br>
30 minutes.<br>
The next step is an ozone injection step which is represented as step 103 in Figures I and 2.<br>
Ozone is generated by an ozone generator. It is preferred to monitor the ozone produced by<br>
the generator to ensure that a sufficient quantity of ozone will be introduced to the sterilization<br>
chamber. Thus preferably the ozone generator is activated before the end of the humidification<br>
step so that sufficient ozone is being generated by the time it is required at the end of the<br>
humidification step. For a sterilization chamber of about 125 Liters, an ozone generation of<br>
between 160 and 200 mg/L at normal temperature and pressure (NTP) from the generator is<br>
preferred. Preferably, used ozone and unrequired ozone is catalytically destroyed (by<br>
conversion to oxygen) before expelling it to the atmosphere to avoid pollution.<br>
A suitable ozone generator produces ozone from oxygen (preferably extra-dry medical grade<br>
oxygen) which is submitted to an electrical field produced inside the generator, suitably at a<br>
high frequency voltage of about 10,000 volts peak to peak. The high voltage permits a corona<br>
discharge in the generator cells to convert the oxygen to ozone. Ozone is heat sensitive, so it<br>
is preferred to keep the ozone generator operation at around 2 to 4°C to optimise ozone<br>
production. When ready, the ozone is introduced into the humidified chamber until the ozone<br>
in the chamber preferably reaches a concentration in the range of about 45 to 100 mg/L NTP,<br>
more preferably about 85 mg/L NTP. Coupled with the high humidity, this concentration is<br>
considered to be sufficient to achieve sterilization.<br>
The next step is the humidified ozone exposure step which is indicated as step 104 in Figures<br>
1 and 2. This step involves maintaining the level of ozone and humidity achieved from the<br>
previous steps for a time sufficient to achieve a satisfactory level of sterilization. A time<br>
period of from 5 minutes to 1 hour may beneeded, although 15 minutes is preferred. This step<br>
completes the first sterilization cycle. In the interest of maximising the assurance of<br>
sterilization, it is preferred to repeat the sterilization with at least a second sterilization cycle,<br>
preferably including repeating at least steps 101, 102, 103 and 104.<br>
However, as noted above, according to the present invention, it has been found that before<br>
starting a second or other additional sterilization cycle, there should be a re-conditioning step.<br>
Thus the next step, according to the invention, is a re-conditioning step which is indicated as<br>
step 105 in Figures 1 and 2. The purpose of this step is to remove any condensed water.<br>
Preferably all, or substantially all of the condensed water is removed and preferably all, or<br>
substantially all of the water vapour is removed in this step. It is preferred that the amount of<br>
water removed is from about 75% to 100% by weight of all the water in the chamber, more<br>
preferably from about 80% to 100%. Thus this step may be regarded as a flushing or purging<br>
step to remove condensed water. It is also preferred that the temperature of the chamber is<br>
restabilized to the target temperature, for example, the preferred temperature of 30.8 °C. The<br>
gaseous vehicle used for this purging or flushing step is preferably a gas which is inert in the<br>
context of the sterilization process. For example, as previously mentioned, nitrogen and other<br>
gases which may form undesirable oxygenated products by contact with ozone are preferably<br>
avoided. In this step, since it follows a previous sterilization cycle which has used ozone, it<br>
is preferred to avoid the use of air because of the high nitrogen content of air. The preferred<br>
gas for this step is oxygen, especially medical grade dry oxygen, which would usually be<br>
readily available in an environment in which the sterilization process of the invention would<br>
normally be used, such as a hospital. The reconditioning step preferably includes, or is<br>
preceded by, a vacuum step to remove humidity and ozone from the chamber. Preferably a<br>
vacuum in the range of about 20 down to 5 Torr, more preferably less than 10 Torr, is applied.<br>
Gaseous contents removed from the chamber are passed to a catalyst to convert any ozone to<br>
oxygen, for environmental reasons. It is preferred to maintain the low pressure such as the<br>
preferred pressure of 10 Torr for a period of time, preferably 2 to 3 minutes, to allow gaseous<br>
contents within articles in the chamber (especially articles having pouches and containers) to<br>
equilibrate with the rest of the chamber, to optimise removal. Medical grade oxygen is then<br>
introduced to the chamber. It is preferred that this re-conditioning step include at least one<br>
repetition of the vacuum and oxygen injection steps to optimise the removal of all<br>
condensation.<br>
When all the sterilization cycles have been completed, a ventilation step is effected, which is<br>
indicated as 107 in Figures 1 and 2. The purpose of this step is to remove ozone and water<br>
vapour before the sterilization chamber is opened and the sterilized articles are removed.<br>
It will be readily understood by a person skilled in the art that the sequence of some of the<br>
steps may be varied without compromising sterilization. Some steps might be effected<br>
simultaneously although the successive sequence described above is preferred.<br>
An ozone sterilizer apparatus, suitable for use with the method of the invention is illustrated<br>
schematically in FIG 3. Medical quality oxygen is subjected in an ozone-generating unit<br>
including an ozone generator 22 to an electrical field, which partially converts the oxygen<br>
into ozone. The ozone is then fed into a humidified sterilization chamber 10 where it sterilises<br>
medical devices. The ozone is subsequently reconverted into oxygen using an ozone<br>
converting unit 52. The only residues left at the end of the sterilization cycle are oxygen and<br>
clean water vapour.<br>
The apparatus includes a heated sterilization chamber 10 which can be sealed to contain a<br>
vacuum. This is achieved with an access door 12, which can be selectively opened for access<br>
into the chamber and which seals the chamber in the closed condition. The apparatus farther<br>
includes ozone generator 22 for supplying ozone-containing gas to the sterilization chamber,<br>
a humidifier arrangement 30 for supplying water vapour to the sterilization chamber, and a<br>
vacuum pump 40 (a suitable pump is a dry scroll vacuum pump manufactured by Anestiwata).<br>
The vacuum pump 40 is used for the application of a sufficient vacuum to the sterilization<br>
chamber 10 to increase the penetration of the sterilizing gas and to be able to boil water at a<br>
temperature below the temperature inside the sterilization chamber. The vacuum pump 40 in<br>
the preferred embodiment is capable of producing a sufficient vacuum in the sterilization<br>
chamber to lower the boiling point of water in the chamber below the temperature in the<br>
chamber. In the preferred apparatus, the vacuum pump is capable of producing a vacuum of<br>
0.1 mbar. Ozone produced in the ozone-generating unit 22 is destroyed in an ozone converting<br>
unit 52 to which ozone-containing gas is fed either after passage through the sterilization<br>
chamber 10 or directly from the ozone-generating unit 22 through valve 29b. The ozone<br>
piping circuit includes an ozone converting catalyst (such as DEST 25, manufacturer TSO3).<br>
The ozone converting unit 52 is connected in series before or after the vacuum pump 40 to<br>
prevent ozone gas escaping to ambient air. The ozone decomposing material in the preferred<br>
catalyst is carulite. For economic and practical reasons, it is preferred to use a catalyst to<br>
decompose the ozone exhausted from the sterilization chamber 10. The catalyst destroys<br>
ozone on contact and converts it into oxygen with a certain amount of heat being produced.<br>
Catalysts of this type and their manufacture are well known to the person skilled in the art of<br>
ozone generators and need not be described in detail herein. Furthermore, other means for<br>
destroying the ozone contained in the sterilization gas will be readily apparent to a person<br>
skilled in the ait. For example, the gas can be heated for a preselected time to a temperature<br>
at which the ozone decomposition is accelerated, for example, to 300°C.<br>
The humidifier arrangement 30 includes a humidifier chamber 32 (such as HUM 0.5,<br>
manufacturer TSO3) sealed from ambient air and connected to the sterilization chamber 10<br>
through a conduit and a vapour intake valve 34. The humidifier chamber 32 is equipped with<br>
a level control to ensure a sufficiently high water level (not shown). Water is directly supplied<br>
to the humidifier chamber 32 from a drinking or purified water supply connection. Water is<br>
supplied to the humidifier chamber 32 by way ofafilter33, a pressure regulator 35, andinput<br>
valve 36. The water vapour produced in the humidifier chamber 32 enters the sterilization<br>
chamber 10 by way of a vapour intake valve 34.<br>
The ozone-generating unit includes an ozone generator 22 (such as OZ, model 14a,<br>
manufacturer TSO3) of the corona discharge type, which is cooled to decrease the ozone<br>
decomposition rate, as is well known in the art. To achieve a good lethality rate in an ozone<br>
sterilization process, the ozone supplied in the sterilization chamber should be sufficient to<br>
obtain a concentration of 48 to 96 milligrams per litre, preferably 50 to 90 milligrams per litre.<br>
At these concentrations, the ozone generation is associated with a relatively high energy loss<br>
in the form of heat. Generally, about 95% of the supplied electrical energy is converted into<br>
heat and only 5% is used to produce ozone. Since heat accelerates the inverse transformation<br>
of ozone into oxygen, it must be removed as quickly as possible by cooling the ozone<br>
generator 22. The ozone generator in the apparatus is kept at the relatively low temperature<br>
of 3 to 6"C by either an indirect cooling system with cooling water recirculation, or a direct<br>
cooling system with a refrigeration unit for cooling. The cooling system 60 is preferably kept<br>
at the temperature of 3 to 6 ºC. In the preferred embodiment, the cooling system is kept at 4°C<br>
so that the ozone-containing gas generated by unit 22 is at the ambient temperature of around<br>
20 to 35ºC, preferably 30°C. Thus, the ozone-containing gas entering into the sterilization<br>
chamber for humidification and sterilization is kept at ambient temperatures of from 20 to<br>
35°C. This means that ozone decomposition is kept to a minimum and that the sterilization<br>
process is more efficient.<br>
The ozone-generating unit is preferably supplied with medical quality or medical grade<br>
oxygen. The apparatus can be connected to a wall oxygen outlet common in hospitals or to<br>
an oxygen cylinder or to any other source capable of supplying the required quality and flow.<br>
The supply of oxygen to the generator 22 takes place across a filter 23, a pressure regulator<br>
24, a flow metre 25 and an oxygen shut-off valve 26. The generator is protected against<br>
oxygen over-pressure by a safety pressure switch. 27. The ozone-oxygen mixture generated<br>
by the generator 22 is directed to the sterilization chamber 10 by a needle valve 28 and a<br>
mixture supply solenoid valve 29a. The mixture can also be directly supplied to the ozone<br>
converting unit 52 by way of a bypass solenoid valve 29b. In a preferred embodiment which<br>
includes a sterilization chamber of 125 litres volume, the pressure regulator 24 preferably<br>
controls the oxygen input at a flow rate of about 1.5 litres per minute. However, it will be<br>
readily apparent to the skilled person that other flow rates may be used depending on the make<br>
and model of the ozone generator 22 and the size of the sterilization chamber.<br>
The apparatus in accordance with the invention preferably includes a closed circuit cooling<br>
system using no fresh water.<br>
The vacuum in the sterilization chamber 10 is produced by the vacuum pump 40 and across<br>
the ozone converting unit 52 and the sterilization chamber drainage valve 44.<br>
OPERATION<br>
As mentioned above, the preferred sterilization method includes the following general steps<br>
as illustrated by the flow chart of FIG. 1. The medical instruments to be sterilized are sealed<br>
in sterile packaging containers or pouches such as generally used in the hospital environment<br>
and then placed into the sterilization chamber. The door of the sterilization chamber is closed<br>
and locked and the preconditioning phase is started by applying a vacuum to the sterilization<br>
chamber. Water vapour is admitted into the sterilization chamber to humidify the chamber<br>
contents. A mixture of ozone and oxygen is supplied to the chamber and the chamber<br>
maintained sealed for apreselected treatment period. In accordance with the present invention,<br>
before repeating the sterilization cycle, a re-conditioning step is effected to remove any<br>
condensed water. Then the vacuum application and ozone supply steps are repeated at least<br>
once. To remove all remaining ozone in the sterilization chamber 10 when the sterilization<br>
cycle is completed a ventilation phase begins. After the ventilation phase is complete, the door<br>
is unlocked and the sterilized material is removed from the chamber.<br>
Before the sterilization cycle begins, the humidifier chamber 32 is filled with water to an<br>
adequate level, which is sufficient to satisfy the requirements for the whole sterilization cycle.<br>
This is done by temporarily opening the water-input valve 36. Valve 36 remains closed for<br>
the whole remainder of the sterilization cycle. In the first phase of the sterilization cycle,<br>
intake valve 18, oxygen shut-off valve 26, mixture supply valve 29a, and mixture bypass<br>
valve 29b(optional) are closed and vapour intake valve 34, and chamber drainage valve 44,<br>
are opened. The sterilization chamber 10 is evacuated to a vacuum pressure of about 0.1 mbar.<br>
Water vapour inlet valve 34 closes when the absolute pressure in the sterilization chamber<br>
falls below 60 mbar. Once a pressure of about 1,0 mbar is achieved, the chamber drainage<br>
valve 44 closes and the vapour intake valve 34 opens to lower the pressure in the humidifier<br>
chamber 32 to the vacuum pressure in the sterilization chamber. That forces the water in the<br>
humidifier chamber to boil and evaporate and to enter the sterilization chamber 10 as water<br>
vapour. Shortly before the end of the humidification period (usually about 2 to 6 min. before<br>
the end of the humidification period), the ozone generator is activated. The flow of the<br>
oxygen/ozone mixture exiting the ozone generator is controlled by ozone mixture supply<br>
valve 29. The apparatus preferably further includes a regulator valve 28 capable of resisting<br>
the vacuum and of adjusting the flow to between 1 and 12 litres per minute. As an optional<br>
feature, the generator can be started at the same time as the humidification period begins. This<br>
is then achieved with shut-off valve 26 and mixture bypass valve 29b. Shut-off valve 26 opens<br>
to let oxygen enter the generator. The ozone-oxygen mixture produced by the generator is<br>
then guided directly into the ozone converting unit 52 through mixture bypass valve 29b and<br>
vacuum pump 40. After a humidification period of approximately 30 minutes, the<br>
oxygen-ozone mixture is guided into the sterilization chamber by opening the mixture supply<br>
valve 29a and closing the mixture bypass valve 29b. The oxygen-ozone mixture enters the<br>
chamber 10 until an ozone concentration of 85 milligrams per litre in the chamber is achieved.<br>
The time required for this step is dependent on the flow rate and concentration of the ozone<br>
gas in the mixture (preferably 10 % to 12 % by weight). At this point in time, the mixture<br>
supply valve 29a is closed to seal off the sterilization chamber and to maintain the humidified<br>
ozone/oxygen gas mixture in the chamber under vacuum.<br>
Once the sterilization chamber is filled with the humidified sterilization gas (mixture of<br>
oxygen and ozone gas), the generator 22 is stopped, the oxygen shut-off valve 26 is closed,<br>
and the ozone is maintained in contact with the articles to be sterilized for about 15 minutes,<br>
for a sterilization chamber of a volume of 125 litres (4 cubic feet). At this stage, the<br>
sterilization chamber is still under the effect of a partial vacuum of about 670 mbar. In an<br>
optional second step, the pressure level is raised to about 900 mbar using oxygen as a filling<br>
gas. This pressure level is maintained for about 20 mm. After the sterilization period, the<br>
vacuum is reapplied, preferably at a pressure of about 1.0 mbar again. Once the vacuum<br>
reaches 0.1 mbar, the humidification phase is recommenced, followed by the renewed<br>
injection of an oxygen/ozone sterilization gas mixture, followed by the sterilization period.<br>
The cycle of applying a vacuum of about 1.0 mbar, injecting sterilization gas, humidifying<br>
and sterilizing, can be repeated, and the number of repeat sterilization cycles (mini cycles)<br>
selected to achieve complete sterilization of the instruments. Preferably, between any two<br>
successive sterilization cycles, a re-conditioning step is effected, as described above, to<br>
remove any condensed water from the sterilization chamber. The number of repeat cycles<br>
used in an experimental set-up of a method in accordance with the invention including a 125<br>
litres (4 cubic foot) chamber was 2 repeat cycles. This set-up conformed to the Security<br>
Assurance Level standards of the FDA (SAL 10 -6).<br>
To remove all remaining ozone and humidity in the sterilization chamber 10 after complete<br>
sterilization (after all successive sterilization cycles) a ventilation phase is engaged. The<br>
ventilation phase begins after the last sterilization cycle. The chamber drainage valve 44 opens<br>
and the vacuum is applied down to approximately 13 mbar. Vapour intake valve 34 closes<br>
when the pressure reaches 60 mbar to evacuate the remaining ozone in the humidifier. Once<br>
the vacuum pressure of 13 mbar is obtained, drainage valve 44 closes and the intake valve 21<br>
opens, admitting oxygen into the sterilization chamber 10. Once atmospheric pressure is<br>
reached, intake valve 21 is closed, the sterilization chamber drainage valve 44 opened, and<br>
vacuumreapplied until apressure of 13 mbar is reached. The ventilation cycle is then repeated<br>
twice. Once the atmospheric pressure is reached after the last cycle, the door mechanism of<br>
the sterilization chamber is activated to permit access to the contents of the sterilization<br>
chamber. The ventilation phase has two functions. First, to remove all ozone residues in the<br>
sterilization chamber before opening the access door and, second, to ensure that the sterilized<br>
material is dry, which is achieved by evaporation of all possibly present condensation when<br>
the vacuum pressure is applied.<br>
The ozone-containing gas evacuated from the sterilization chamber 10 is passed over the<br>
ozone decomposing catalyst 52 of the ozone converting unit 50 prior to exhausting the gas to<br>
the atmosphere to ensure a complete decomposition of the ozone in the sterilization gas. The<br>
ozone generator 22 is used during only two portions of the sterilization cycle, the activation<br>
of the generator 22 (with optional valves 29a and 29b) and the evacuation of the sterilization<br>
chamber 10. During the start up phase of the generator 22, the mixture bypass valve 29b is<br>
opened and the ozone is guided across the catalyst. Once the start-up phase of the generator<br>
22 is complete, the bypass valve 29b closes. During evacuation of the sterilization chamber<br>
10, the sterilization chamber drainage valve 44 is opened and the ozone containing<br>
sterilization waste gas guided to the catalyst. Once the evacuation of the sterilization chamber<br>
10 is completed, the drainage valve 44 is closed. The circulation of ozone is ensured by the<br>
vacuum pump 40, which operates during the whole sterilization cycle including all repeat<br>
cycles. If the ozone decomposing catalyst is located upstream of the vacuum pump this also<br>
ensures that the carulite is kept as dry as possible in order to avoid fouling of the catalytic<br>
material. Since the vacuum pump 40 is running during the whole sterilization process, the<br>
carulite is exposed to reduced pressures, even if it is not used for the decomposition of ozone.<br>
This forces evaporation of water contained in the catalyst, which may have been absorbed by<br>
the carulite during the evacuation of the sterilization chamber. If located downstream of the<br>
vacuum pump, the catalyst is preferably heated to keep the carulite sufficiently dry.<br>
A system, such as the one described above, suitable for use with the method of the invention<br>
is capable of maintaining a relative humidity level of 90%, preferably 95 % ± 5% or higher,<br>
throughout the sterilization cycle.<br>
The energy needed to evaporate the water during the humidification phase is taken frommany<br>
sources. It is taken from the structure of the humidifier unit and the sterilization chamber and<br>
from thematerial to be sterilized. This contributes to a further cooling of the chamber, and its<br>
contents. In effect, at 20°C, water boils up to an absolute pressure of 23.3 mbar and 35°C,<br>
water boils up to an absolute pressure of 56.3 mbar. The vacuum in the sterilization chamber<br>
is preferably adjusted to apressure where the boiling temperature of water is lowered below<br>
the temperature in the sterilization chamber. That boiling temperature may be so low that,<br>
depending on the energy available from the surrounding structure and gases, the water in the<br>
humidifier chamber will freeze before it gets vaporized. The humidifier may also be cooled<br>
by the evaporation process to apointwhere condensation freezes to the external surface of the<br>
humidifier. This can be avoided by heating the external surface of the humidifier sufficiently<br>
to keep the exterior of the humidifier unit and the water inside the humidifier chamber atroom<br>
temperature, preferably at or above the temperature of the sterilization chamber. This is<br>
achieved with a heating arrangement (not illustrated) which will be readily apparent to the<br>
person of skill in the art.<br>
The water vapour generated in the humidifier unit increases the relative humidity in the<br>
sterilization chamber, The humidification phaseis continued until the relative humidity ofthe<br>
gas surrounding the medical instruments contained in the packaging pouches and containers<br>
reaches a minimum of 95% ± 5%, preferably 100%. For a sterilization chamber of an<br>
approximate volume of 125 litres, the water vapour admission increases the pressure to about<br>
53 mbar in the sterilization chamber.<br>
Oxygen/ozone-containing stertf ization gas is injected into the humidified sterilization chamber<br>
at ambient temperature. For optimum operation of a sterilizer having a 125 litres chamber, a<br>
system is preferably used which is capable of generating an ozone flow in the range of about<br>
1 to about 6 litres per minute, more preferably about 1.5 to 2 litres per minute, containing<br>
from about 160 to 200 mg/1 of ozone to obtain at least a total of around 10,000 mg of ozone<br>
for each of the fillings of the sterilization chamber.<br>
