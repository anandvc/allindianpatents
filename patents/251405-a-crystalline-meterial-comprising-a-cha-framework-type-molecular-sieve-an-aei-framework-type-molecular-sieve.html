FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to a novel chabazite-containing molecular<br>
sieve, its synthesis and its use in the conversion of oxygenates, particularly methanol, to olefins, particularly ethylene and propylene.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The conversion of oxygenates to olefins (OTO) is currently the<br>
subject of intense research because it has the potential for replacing the long¬<br>
standing steam cracking technology that is today the industry-standard for<br>
producing world scale quantities of ethylene and propylene. The very large<br>
volumes involved suggest that substantial economic incentives exist for alternate<br>
technologies that can deliver high throughputs of light olefins in a cost efficient<br>
manner. Whereas steam cracking relies on non-selective thermal reactions of<br>
naphtha range hydrocarbons at very high temperatures, OTO exploits catalytic and<br>
microrarchitectural properties of acidic molecular sieves under milder temperature<br>
conditions to produce high yields of ethylene and propylene from methanol.<br>
[0003]	Current understanding of the OTO reactions suggests a complex<br>
sequence in which three major steps can be identified: (1) an induction period leading to the formation of an active carbon pool (alkyl-aromatics), (2) alkylation-dealkylation reactions of these active intermediates leading to products, and (3) a gradual build-up of condensed ring aromatics. OTO is therefore an inherently transient chemical transformation in which the catalyst is in a continuous state of change. The ability of the catalyst to maintain high olefin yields for prolonged periods of time relies on a delicate balance between the relative rates at which the above processes take place. The formation of coke-like molecules is of singular importance because their accumulation interferes with the desired reaction sequence in a number of ways.    In particular, coke renders the carbon pool<br>
inactive, lowers the rates of diffusion of reactants and products, increases the<br>
potential for undesired secondary reactions and limits catalyst life.<br>
[0004]	Over the last two decades, many catalytic materials have been<br>
identified as being useful for carrying out the OTO reactions. Crystalline microporous materials are the preferred catalysts today because they simultaneously address the acidity and morphological requirements for the reactions. Particularly preferred materials are eight-membered ring aluminosilicates, such as those having the chabazite and AEI framework types, and their silicoaluminophosphate counterparts, such as SAPO-34 and SAPO-18. These molecular sieves have cages that are sufficiently large to accommodate aromatic intermediates while still allowing the diffusional transport of reactants and products into and out of the crystals through regularly interconnected window apertures. By complementing such morphological characteristics with appropriate levels of acid strength and acid density, working catalysts are produced. Extensive research in this area indicates that silicoaluminophosphates are currently more effective OTO catalysts than aluminosilicates. In particular, the control of the silica to alumina molar ratio is a key requirement for the use of aluminosilicates in OTO reactions. Nevertheless, aluminosilicate zeolites continue to be explored for use in OTO and appear to have yet undiscovered potential.<br>
[0005]	Chabazite is a naturally occurring zeolite with the approximate<br>
formula C^Al^Sia-^O?!. Three synthetic forms of chabazite are described in "Zeolite Molecular Sieves", by D. W. Breck, published in 1973 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, the complete disclosure of which is incorporated herein by specific reference. The three synthetic forms reported by Breck are Zeolite "K-G", described in J. Chem. Soc., p. 2822 (1956), Barrer et al; Zeolite D, described in British Patent No. 868,846 (1961); and Zeolite R, described in U.S. Patent No. 3,030,181 (1962). Zeolite K-G zeolite has a silica:alumina mole ratio of 2.3:1 to 4.15:1, whereas zeolites D and R have silica:alumina mole ratios of 4.5:1 to 4.9:1 and 3.45:1 to 3.65:1, respectively.<br>
|0006]	U.S.  Patent  No.  4,544,538,  incorporated  herein  by reference,<br>
describes the synthesis of another synthetic form of chabazite, SSZ-13, using N-<br>
alkyl-3-quinuclidinol, N,N,N-tri-alkyl-l-adamantylammonium cations and/or N,N,N-trialkyl-exoaminonorbornane as a directing agent in a conventional OH" medium. According to the '538 patent, SSZ-13 typically has a silica to alumina molar ratio of 8 to 50, but it is stated that higher molar ratios can be obtained by varying the relative ratios of the reactants in the synthesis mixture and/or by treating the zeolite with chelating agents or acids to remove aluminum from the zeolite lattice. However, attempts to synthesize SSZ-13 in OH' media at silica to alumina molar ratios in excess of 100 have been unsuccessful and have produced ITQ-1 or SSZ-23, depending on the alkali metal cation present. Moreover, increasing the silica to alumina molar ratio of SSZ-13 by dealumination has met little or no success.<br>
[0007]	Significant work has been conducted on the use of SSZ-13 as a<br>
catalyst for MTO reactions. However, investigations to date have shown that the performance of SSZ-13 is always inferior to that of its silicoaluminophosphate analog, SAPO-34. See, for example, Yuen, L.-T., Zones, S. I., Harris, T. V., Gallegos, E. J., and Auroux, A., "Product Selectivity in Methanol to Hydrocarbon Conversion for Isostructural Compositions of API and CHA Molecular Sieves", Microporous Materials 2, 105-117 (1994) and Dahl, I. M., Mostad, H., Akporiaye, D., and Wendelbo, R., "Structural and Chemical Influences on the MTO Reaction: A Comparison of Chabazite and SAPO-34 as MTO Catalysts", Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 29, 185-190 (1999).<br>
[0008]	A silica crystalline molecular sieve having the CHA framework<br>
type	has	been	hydrothermally	synthesized	using<br>
N,N,N-trimethyladamantylammonium in hydroxide form as the structure-directing agent at nearly neutral pH in the presence of fluoride. See Diaz-Cabanas, M-J, Barrett, P. A., and Camblor, M. A. "Synthesis and Structure of Pure SiO2 Chabazite: the SiO: Polymorph with the Lowest Framework Density", Chem. Commun. 1881 (1998).<br>
[0009]	More recently, an aluminosilicate with the CHA framework type<br>
and having a silica to alumina molar ratio in excess of 100, such as from 150 to 2000, has been synthesized again in the presence of fluoride ions. See U.S. Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 2003/0176751 published September 18, 2003 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0010]	Molecular sieves of the AEI framework-type do not exist in nature.<br>
However, a number of aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates having the AEI framework type have been synthesized, including SAPO-18, ALPO-18 and RUW-18. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,958,370, incorporated herein by reference, discloses an aluminosilicate zeolite having an AEI framework-type and a silica to alumina molar ratio of 10 to 100. Aluminosilicates having a silica to alumina ratio greater than 100 and all-silica molecular sieves with an AEI framework-type have so far not been reported.<br>
[0011]	Regular crystalline molecular sieves, such as the AEI and CHA<br>
framework types, are built from structurally invariant building units, called<br>
Periodic Building Units, and are periodically ordered in three dimensions.<br>
However, disordered structures showing periodic ordering in less than three<br>
dimensions are also known. One such disordered structure is a disordered planar<br>
intergrowth in which the repeated building units from more than one framework<br>
type, e.g., both AEI and CHA, are present. In addition, for certain molecular<br>
sieves, the building units can exist in mirror image forms, which can result in<br>
stacking faults where a sequence of building units of one mirror image form<br>
intersects a sequence of building units of the opposite mirror image form.<br>
[0012]	U.S. Patent No. 6,334,994, incorporated herein by reference,<br>
discloses a silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve, referred to as RUW-19, which is said to be an AE1/CHA mixed phase composition. In particular, RUW-19 is reported as having peaks characteristic of both CHA and AEI framework type molecular sieves, except that the broad feature centered at about 16.9 (26) in RUW-19 replaces the pair of reflections centered at about 17.0 (20) in AEI materials and RUW-19 does not have the reflections associated with CHA materials centered at 26 values of 17.8 and 24.8.<br>
[0013]	U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0165089, published<br>
November 7, 2002 and incorporated herein by reference, discloses a silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve comprising at least one intergrown phase of molecular sieves having AE1 and CHA framework types, wherein said<br>
intergrown phase has an  AEI/CHA  ratio of from about  5/95 to 40/60 as<br>
determined by DIFFaX analysis, using the powder X-ray diffraction pattern of a<br>
calcined sample of said silicoaluminophosphate molecular sieve.<br>
[0014]	Phosphorus-free molecular sieves, such as aluminosilicates and<br>
silicas, comprising CHA/AEI intergrowths have so far not been reported.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0034]	The present invention relates to a novel crystalline material that is<br>
substantially free of framework phosphorus and that comprises a CHA framework type molecular sieve with stacking faults or at least one intergrown phase of a CHA framework type molecular sieve and an AEI framework type molecular sieve. The invention also relates to the synthesis of this novel crystalline material in a halide, and particularly a fluoride, medium and to use of the material, such as in a process for the conversion of oxygenates, particularly methanol, to olefms, particularly ethylene and propylene.<br>
[0035]	Intergrown    molecular    sieve   phases    are    disordered    planar<br>
intergrowths of molecular sieve frameworks. Reference is directed to the "Catalog of Disordered Zeolite Structures", 2000 Edition, published by the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association and to the "Collection of Simulated XRD Powder Patterns for Zeolites", M. M. J. Treacy and J. B. Higgins, 2001 Edition, published on behalf of the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association for a detailed explanation on intergrown molecular sieve phases.<br>
[0036]	Regular crystalline solids  are built from  structurally invariant<br>
building units, called Periodic Building Units, and are periodically ordered in three dimensions. Structurally disordered structures show periodic ordering in dimensions less than three, i.e. in two, one or zero dimensions. This phenomenon is called stacking disorder of structurally invariant Periodic Building Units. Crystal structures built from Periodic Building Units are called end-member structures if periodic ordering is achieved in all three dimensions. Disordered<br>
structures are those where the stacking sequence of the Periodic Building Units<br>
deviates from periodic ordering up to statistical stacking sequences.<br>
[0037]	In the case of regular AE] and CHA framework type molecular<br>
sieves, the Periodic Building Unit is a double six ring layer. There are two types of layers "a" and "b", which are topologically identical except "b" is the mirror image of "a". When layers of the same type stack on top of one another, i.e. aaaaaaaa or bbbbbbbb, the framework type CHA is generated. When layers "a" and "b" alternate, ie, abababab, the framework type AEI is generated. Intergrown AEI/CHA molecular sieves comprise regions of CHA framework type sequences and regions of AEI framework type sequences. Each change from a CHA to an AEI framework type sequence results in a stacking fault. In addition, stacking faults can occur in a pure CHA phase material when a sequence of one mirror image layers intersects a sequence of the opposite mirror image layers, such as for example in aaaaaabbbbbbb.<br>
[0038]	Analysis  of intergrown  molecular  sieves,   such  as  AEI/CHA<br>
intergrowths, can be effected by X-ray diffraction and in particular by comparing the observed patterns with calculated patterns generated using algorithms to simulate the effects of stacking disorder. DIFFaX is a computer program based on a mathematical model for calculating intensities from crystals containing planar faults (see M. M. J. Tracey et al., Proceedings of the Royal Chemical Society, London, A [1991], Vol. 433, pp. 499-520). DIFFaX is the simulation program selected by and available from the International Zeolite Association to simulate the XRD powder patterns for randomly intergrown phases of zeolites (see "Collection of Simulated XRD Powder Patterns for Zeolites" by M. M. J. Treacy and J. B. Higgins, 2001, Fourth Edition, published on behalf of the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association). It has also been used to theoretically study intergrown phases of AEI, CHA and KFI, as reported by K. P. Lillerud et al. in "Studies in Surface Science and Catalysis", 1994, Vol. 84, pp. 543-550.<br>
|0039]	Figures   la   and   Ib   show   the   simulated   diffraction   patterns<br>
calculated by DIFFaX for single intergrown zeolite phases having various AEI/CHA ratios. These patterns were calculated using the input file given in<br>
Table 1 below, with each pattern being normalized to the highest peak of the entire set of simulated patterns, i.e. the peak at about 9.6 degrees 28 for the 0/100 AEI/CHA pattern. Normalization of intensity values allows the intensity of an X-ray diffraction peak at a certain 26 value to be compared between different diffraction patterns.<br>
[0040]	Where the crystalline material of the invention comprises an<br>
intergrowth of a CHA framework type molecular sieve and an AEI framework<br>
type molecular sieve, the material can possess a widely varying AEI/CHA ratio of<br>
from about 99:1 to about 1:99, such as from about 98:2 to about 2:98, for example<br>
from about 95:5 to 5:95. In one embodiment, where the material is to be used a<br>
catalyst in the conversion of oxygenates to olefins, the intergrowth is preferably<br>
CHA-rich and has AEI/CHA ratio ranging from about 5:95 to about 30:70. In<br>
addition, in some cases the intergrown material of the invention may comprise a<br>
plurality of intergrown phases each having a different AEI/CHA ratio. The<br>
relative amounts of AEI and CHA framework-type materials in the intergrowth of<br>
the invention can be determined by a variety of known techniques including<br>
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and DIFFaX analysis, using the powder<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern of a calcined sample of the molecular sieve.<br>
[0041]	Where the crystalline material of the invention comprises a CHA<br>
framework type molecular sieve but with stacking faults, the presence of these stacking faults can readily be determined by transmission electron microscopy. It is to be appreciated that stacking faults may not be present in every crystal of the CHA material but generally will be present in at least 5%, such as at least 10%, of the crystals.<br>
[0042]	In its calcined and anhydrous form, the crystalline material of the<br>
present invention has a composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
(n)X203:Y02!<br>
wherein X is a trivalent element, such as aluminum, boron, iron, indium, and/or gallium, typically aluminum; Y is a tetravalent element, such as silicon, tin, titanium and/or germanium, typically silicon; and n is from 0 to about 0.5, conveniently from 0 to about 0.125, for example from about 0.001 to about 0.1, such as from about 0.0017 to about 0.02. Where a halide-containing compound<br>
has been used in the synthesis of the material, the calcined form of the material of<br>
the present invention is normally found to contain trace amounts, typically from<br>
about 1 to about 100 ppm, for example from about 5 to about 50 ppm, such as<br>
from about 10 to about 20 ppm, by weight of the halide, preferably fluoride.<br>
[0043]	In its as-synthesized form, the crystalline material of the present<br>
invention typically has a composition involving the molar relationship:<br>
(n)X2O3:YO2:(m)R:(x)F:z H2O,<br>
wherein X, Y and n are as defined in the preceding paragraph, R is at least one organic directing agent and wherein m ranges from about 0.01 to about 2, such as from about 0.1 to about 1, z ranges from about 0.5 to about 100, such as from about 2 to about 20 and x ranges from about 0 to about 2, such as from about 0.01 to about 1. The R and F components, which are associated with the material as a result of their presence during crystallization, can be at least partly removed by post-crystallization methods hereinafter more particularly described. Typically, in its as-synthesized form, the intergrowth of the present invention contains only low levels of alkali metal, generally such that the combined amount of any potassium and sodium is less than 50% of the X2C&gt;3 on a molar basis. For this reason, after removal of the organic directing agent (R), the material generally exhibits catalytic activity without a preliminary ion-exchange step to remove alkali metal cations.<br>
[0044]	As will be discussed below, the least one organic directing agent<br>
(R) typically comprises at least one first organic directing agent for directing the synthesis of a CHA framework-type material and at least one second organic directing agent for directing the synthesis of an AEI framework-type material. It is found that these directing agents are typically retained intact in the intramolecular structure of the molecular sieve product. Depending on the composition of the directing agents it will normally possible to determine the relative amounts of the different directing agents retained in the as-synthesized molecular sieve by analytical techniques, such as !3C MAS (magic-angle spinning) NMR. Thus, in a preferred embodiment, where the first organic directing agent is an N,N,N-trimethyl-l-adamantylammonium compound (TMAA) and the second organic directing agent is an N,N-diethyl-2,6-<br>
dimethylpiperidinium compound (DEDMP), the DEDMP exhibits peaks corresponding to the C nuclei in the CHa moieties in the 0 to 20 ppm range of the 13C MAS NMR spectrum, which peaks are not present in the 13C MAS NMR spectrum of the TMAA. This, by measuring the peak heights in the 0 to 20 ppm range of the 13C MAS NMR spectrum, the relative amounts of TMAA and DEDMP in the as-synthesized material can be determined. Preferably, the molar amount of AEI directing agent retained in the as-synthesized material to the total molar amount of AEI and CHA directing agent retained in the as-synthesized material is between 0.1 and 0.3.<br>
[0045]	To the extent desired and depending on the X2O3/YO2 molar ratio<br>
of the material, any cations in the as-synthesized intergrowth can be replaced in accordance with techniques well known in the art, at least in part, by ion exchange with other cations. Preferred replacing cations include metal ions, hydrogen ions, hydrogen precursor, e.g., ammonium ions, and mixtures thereof. Particularly preferred cations are those which tailor the catalytic activity for certain hydrocarbon conversion reactions. These include hydrogen, rare earth metals and metals of Groups IIA, IIIA, IV A, VA, IB, IIB, IIIB, IVB, VB, VIB, VIIB and VIII of the Periodic Table of the Elements.<br>
[0046]	The intergrowth of the invention can be prepared from a reaction<br>
mixture containing a source of water, a source of an oxide of the tetravalent element Y, optionally a source of an oxide of the trivalent element X, at least one organic directing agent I as described below, and typically a halide or a halide-containing compound, such as a fluoride or a fluoride-containing compound, said reaction mixture having a composition, in terms of mole ratios of oxides, within the following ranges:<br><br>
[0047]	Where the tetravalent element Y is silicon, suitable sources of<br>
silicon include silicates, e.g., tetraalkyl orthosilicates, fumed silica, such as Aerosil (available from Degussa), and aqueous colloidal suspensions of silica, for example that sold by E.I. du Pont de Nemours under the tradename Ludox. Where the trivalent element X is aluminum, suitable sources of aluminum include aluminum salts, especially water-soluble salts, such as aluminum nitrate, as well as hydrated aluminum oxides, such as boehmite and pseudoboehmite. Where the halide is fluoride, suitable sources of fluoride include hydrogen fluoride, although more benign sources of fluoride such as alkali metal fluorides and fluoride salts of the organic directing agent are preferred.<br>
[0048]	The at least one organic directing agent R used herein conveniently<br>
comprises a mixture of a plurality of different organic directing agents. Preferably, the mixture comprises at least one first organic directing agent for directing the synthesis of a CHA framework-type material and at least one second organic directing agent for directing the synthesis of an AEI framework-type material.<br>
[0049]	Suitable first organic directing agents for directing the synthesis of<br>
a CHA framework-type material include N,N,N-trimethyl-l-adamantammoniurn<br>
compounds, N,N,N-trimethyl-2-adamantammonium compounds, N,N,N-<br>
trimethylcyclohexylammonium	compounds,	N,N-dimethyl-3,3-<br>

compounds, N,N-dimethyl-2-methylpiperidinium compounds, 1,3,3,6,6-<br>
pentamethyl-6-azonio-bicyclo(3,2.1)octane	compounds,	N,N-<br>
dimethylcyclohexylamine, and the bi- and tri-cyclic nitrogen containing organic<br>

and (4) in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,544,538 and 6,709,644. Suitable compounds include<br>
hydroxides and salts, such as halides, especially chlorides and fluorides.<br>
|0050]	Suitable second organic directing agents for directing the synthesis<br>
of an AEI framework-type material include N,N-diethy]-2,6-dimethylpiperdinium<br><br>
compounds (mixture or either of the cis/trans isomers), N,N-dimethyl-2,6-dimethylpiperdinium compounds (mixture or either of the cis/trans isomers), and the directing agents cited in J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2000, 122, p 263-273 and U.S. Patent No. 5,958,370.. Suitable compounds include hydroxides and salts, such as halides, especially chlorides and fluorides.<br>
[0051]	Conveniently, the molar ratio of the first organic directing agent to<br>
the second organic directing agent in the reaction mixture is from about 0.01 to about 100, such as from about 0.02 to about 50, for example from about 0.03 to about 33, such as from about 0.03 to about 3, for example from about 0.05 to about 0.3.<br>
[0052]	In -one  embodiment,  the  organic  directing  agent comprises  a<br>
mixture of cyclic amines or ammonium compounds, particularly a mixture where one component is a multi-cyclic amine or ammonium compound and more particularly a mixture where one component is a multi-cyclic amine or ammonium compound and another component is a monocyclic amine or ammonium compound. Conveniently, the monocyclic amine or ammonium compound comprises a substituted piperidine or piperidinium compound, for example a tetraalkylpiperidinium compound, typically an N,N-diethyl-2,6-dimethylpiperidinium compound. Conveniently, the multi-cyclic amine or ammonium compound comprises a tetracyclic amine or ammonium compound, such as an adamantylamine or ammonium compound, for example an N,N,N-trialkyl-1-adamantylammonium compound; typically an N,N,N-trimethyl-l-adamantylammonium compound. Thus the term multi-cyclic amine is used herein to include multi-cyclic compounds in which the N atom is external to the rings. Suitable ammonium compounds include hydroxides and salts, such as halides, especially chlorides.<br>
[0053]	Conveniently, the reaction mixture has a pH of about 4 to about 14,<br>
such as about 4 to about 10, for example about 6 to about 8.<br>
[0054]	Crystallization  can  be  carried  out   at   either  static  or  stirred<br>
conditions in a suitable reactor vessel, such as for example, polypropylene jars or Teflon®-lined or stainless steel autoclaves, at a temperature of about 50°C to about 300°C, such as about 135°C to about 185°C, for a time sufficient for<br>
crystallization to occur. Formation of the crystalline product can take anywhere from around 30 minutes up to as much as 2 weeks, such as from about 45 minutes to about 240 hours, for example from about 1.0 to about 120 hours. The duration depends on the temperature employed, with higher temperatures typically requiring shorter hydrothermal treatments.<br>
[0055]	Synthesis of the new intergrowth may be facilitated by the presence<br>
of at least 0.1 ppm, such as at least 10 ppm, for example at least 100 ppm, conveniently at least 500 ppm of seed crystals based on total weight of the reaction mixture. The seed crystals can be homostructural with the crystalline material of the present invention, for example the product of a previous synthesis, or can be a heterostructural crystalline material, such as an AEI, LEV, OFF, CHA or ERI framework-type molecular sieve. Conveniently, the seed material is an AEI-type molecular sieve, and particularly an AEI-type aluminosilicate. The seeds may be added to the reaction mixture as a colloidal suspension in a liquid medium, such as water. The production of colloidal seed suspensions and their use in the synthesis of molecular sieves are disclosed in, for example, International Publication Nos. WO 00/06493 and WO 00/06494 published on February 10, 2000 and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0056]	Typically, the crystalline product is formed in solution and can be<br>
recovered by standard means, such as by centrifugation or filtration. The separated product can also be washed, recovered by centrifugation or filtration and dried.<br>
[0057]	As a result of the crystallization process, the recovered crystalline<br>
product contains within its pores at least a portion of the organic directing agent used in the synthesis. In a preferred embodiment, activation is performed in such a manner that the organic directing agent is removed from the molecular sieve, leaving active catalytic sites within the microporous channels of the molecular sieve open for contact with a feedstock. The activation process is typically accomplished by calcining, or essentially heating the molecular sieve comprising the template at a temperature of from about 200°C to about 800°C in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas. In some cases, it may be desirable to heat the molecular sieve in an environment having a low or zero oxygen concentration.<br>
This type of process can be used for partial or complete removal of the organic<br>
directing agent from the intracrystalline pore system.  In other cases, particularly<br>
with smaller organic directing agents, complete or partial removal from the sieve<br>
can be accomplished by conventional desorption processes.<br>
[0058]	Once the intergrown crystalline material of the invention has been<br>
synthesized, it can be formulated into a catalyst composition by combination with other materials, such as binders and/or matrix materials, that provide additional hardness or catalytic activity to the finished catalyst.<br>
(0059]	Materials which can be blended with the intergrown crystalline<br>
material of the invention can be various inert or catalytically active materials.<br>
These materials include compositions such as kaolin and other clays, various<br>
forms of rare earth metals, other non-zeolite catalyst components, zeolite catalyst<br>
components, alumina or alumina sol, titania, zirconia, quartz, silica or silica sol,<br>
and mixtures thereof. These components are also effective in reducing overall<br>
catalyst cost, acting as a thermal sink to assist in heat shielding the catalyst during<br>
regeneration, densifying the catalyst and increasing catalyst strength. When<br>
blended with such components, the amount of intergrown crystalline material<br>
contained in the final catalyst product ranges from 10 to 90 weight percent of the<br>
total catalyst, preferably 20 to 80 weight percent of the total catalyst.<br>
[0060]	The intergrown crystalline material described herein can be used to<br>
dry gases and liquids; for selective molecular separation based on size and polar properties; as an ion-exchanger; as a chemical carrier; in gas chromatography; and as a catalyst in organic conversion reactions. Examples of suitable catalytic uses of the intergrown crystalline material described herein include (a) hydrocracking of heavy petroleum residual feedstocks, cyclic stocks and other hydrocrackate charge stocks, normally in the presence of a hydrogenation component selected from Groups 6 and 8 to 10 of the Periodic Table of Elements; (b) dewaxing, including isomerization dewaxing, to selectively remove straight chain paraffins from hydrocarbon feedstocks typically boiling above 177°C, including raffmates and lubricating oil basestocks; (c) catalytic cracking of hydrocarbon feedstocks, such as naphthas, gas oils and residual oils, normally in the presence of a large pore cracking catalyst, such as zeolite Y; (d) oligomerization of straight and<br>
branched chain olefms having from about 2 to 21, preferably 2 to 5 carbon atoms, to produce medium to heavy olefms which are useful for both fuels, i.e., gasoline or a gasoline blending stock, and chemicals; (e) isomerization of olefms, particularly olefms having 4 to 6 carbon atoms, and especially normal butene to produce iso-olefins; (f) upgrading of lower alkanes, such as methane, to higher hydrocarbons, such as ethylene and benzene; (g) disproportionation of alkylaromatic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, to produce dialkylaromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylenes; (h) alkylation of aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, with olefms, such as ethylene and propylene to produce ethylbenzene and cumene; (i) isomerization of dialkylaromatic hydrocarbons, such as xylenes, (j) catalytic reduction of nitrogen oxides and (k) synthesis of monoalkylamines and dialkylamines.<br>
[0061]	In particular, the intergrown crystalline material described herein is<br>
useful as a catalyst in the conversion of oxygenates to one or more olefms, particularly ethylene and propylene. As used herein, the term "oxygenates" is defined to include, but is not necessarily limited to aliphatic alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds (aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonates, and the like), and also compounds containing hetero-atoms, such as, halides, mercaptans, sulfides, amines, and mixtures thereof. The aliphatic moiety will normally contain from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, such as from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms.<br>
[0062]	Representative oxygenates include lower straight chain or branched<br>
aliphatic alcohols, their unsaturated counterparts, and their nitrogen, halogen and sulfur analogues. Examples of suitable oxygenate compounds include methanol; ethanol; n-propanol; isopropanol; €4 - Cio alcohols; methyl ethyl ether; dimethyl ether; diethyl ether; di-isopropyl ether; methyl mercaptan; methyl sulfide; methyl amine; ethyl mercaptan; di-ethyl sulfide; di-ethyl amine; ethyl chloride; formaldehyde; di-methyl carbonate; di-methyl kelone; acetic acid; n-alkyl amines, n-alkyl halides, n-alkyl sulfides having n-alkyl groups of comprising the range of from about 3 to about 10 carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof. Particularly suitable oxygenate compounds are methanol, dimethyl ether, or mixtures thereof, most preferably methanol. As used herein, the term "oxygenate" designates only the<br>
organic material used as the feed. The total charge of feed to the reaction zone may contain additional compounds, such as diluents.<br>
[0063]	In   the   present   oxygenate   conversion   process,   a   feedstock<br>
comprising an organic oxygenate, optionally with one or more diluents, is contacted in the vapor phase in a reaction zone with a catalyst comprising the molecular sieve of the present invention at effective process conditions so as to produce the desired olefins. Alternatively, the process may be carried out in a liquid or a mixed vapor/liquid phase. When the process is carried out in the liquid phase or a mixed vapor/liquid phase, different conversion rates and selectivities of feedstock-to-product may result depending upon the catalyst and the reaction conditions.<br>
[0064]	When  present,  the diluent(s)  is  generally non-reactive to the<br>
feedstock or molecular sieve catalyst composition and is typically used to reduce the concentration of the oxygenate in the feedstock. Non-limiting examples of suitable diluents include helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, essentially non-reactive paraffins (especially alkanes such as methane, ethane, and propane), essentially non-reactive aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof. The most preferred diluents are water and nitrogen, with water being particularly preferred. Diluent(s) may comprise from about 1 mol % to about 99 mol % of the total feed mixture.<br>
(0065]	The temperature employed in the oxygenate conversion process<br>
may vary over a wide range, such as from about 200°C to about 1000°C, for<br>
example from about 250°C to about 800°C, including from about 250°C to about<br>
750 °C, conveniently from about 300°C to about 650°C, typically from about<br>
350°C to about 600°C and particularly from about 400°C to about 600°C.<br>
[0066]	Light  olefin  products  will   form,  although  not  necessarily  in<br>
optimum amounts, at a wide range of pressures, including but not limited to autogenous pressures and pressures in the range of from about 0.1 kPa to about 10 MPa. Conveniently, the pressure is in the range of from about 7 kPa to about 5 MPa, such as in the range of from about 50 kPa to about 1 MPa. The foregoing pressures are exclusive of diluent, if any is present, and refer to the partial pressure of the feedstock as it relates to oxygenate compounds and/or mixtures<br>
thereof. Lower and upper extremes of pressure may adversely affect selectivity, conversion, coking rate, and/or reaction rate; however, light olefins such as ethylene still may form.<br>
J0067]	The process should be continued for a period of time sufficient to<br>
produce the desired olefin products. The reaction time may vary from tenths of seconds to a number of hours. The reaction time is largely determined by the reaction temperature, the pressure, the catalyst selected, the weight hourly space velocity, the phase (liquid or vapor) and the selected process design characteristics.<br>
|0068]	A wide range of weight hourly space velocities (WHSV) for the<br>
feedstock will function in the present process. WHSV is defined as weight of feed (excluding diluent) per hour per weight of a total reaction volume of molecular sieve catalyst (excluding inerts and/or fillers). The WHSV generally should be in the range of from about 0.01 hr"1 to about 500 hr"1, such as in the range of from about 0.5 hr"1 to about 300 hr"1, for example in the range of from about 0.1 hr"1 to about 200 hr"1.<br>
[0069]	A practical embodiment of a reactor system for the oxygenate<br>
conversion process is a circulating fluid bed reactor with continuous regeneration, similar to a modem fluid catalytic cracker. Fixed beds are generally not preferred for the process because oxygenate to olefin conversion is a highly exothermic process which requires several stages with intercoolers or other cooling devices. The reaction also results in a high pressure drop due to the production of low pressure, low density gas.<br>
|0070]	Because the catalyst must be regenerated frequently, the reactor<br>
should allow easy removal of a portion of the catalyst to a regenerator, where the catalyst is subjected to a regeneration medium, such as a gas comprising oxygen, for example air, to burn off coke from the catalyst, which restores the catalyst activity. The conditions of temperature, oxygen partial pressure, and residence time in the regenerator should be selected to achieve a coke content on regenerated catalyst of less than about 0.5 wt %. At least a portion of the regenerated catalvst should be relumed to the reactor.<br>
[0071]	In one embodiment, prior to being used to convert oxygenate to<br>
olefins, the catalyst is pretreated with dimethyl ether, a C2-C4 aldehyde composition and/or a C^-Ci olefm composition to form an integrated hydrocarbon co-catalyst within the porous framework of the intergrown molecular sieve. Desirably, the pretreatment is conducted at a temperature of at least 10°C, such as at least 25°C, for example at least 50°C, higher than the temperature used for the oxygenate reaction zone and is arranged to produce at least 0.1 wt%, such as at least lwt%, for example at least about 5wt% of the integrated hydrocarbon co-catalyst, based on total weight of the molecular sieve. Such preliminary treating to increase the carbon content of the molecular sieve is known as "pre-pooling" and is further described in U.S. Application Serial Nos. 10/712668, 10/712952 and 10/712953 all of which were filed November 12, 2003 and are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0072]	The  invention  will  now be  more particularly  described  with<br>
reference to the following Examples and the accompanying drawings. In the Examples, the X-ray diffraction data were collected with several types of instruments:<br>
•	Philips XRD shall hereinafter refer to X-ray diffraction data collected with<br>
a Philips powder X-Ray Diffractometer, equipped with a scintillation<br>
detector with graphite monochromator, using copper K-alpha radiation.<br>
The diffraction data were recorded by step-scanning at 0.02 degrees of<br>
two-theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, and a counting time of 1 second<br>
for each step. The interplanar spacings, d's, were calculated in Angstrom<br>
units, and the relative intensities of the lines, I/I0, where I0 is the intensity<br>
of the strongest line, above background were determined by integrating the<br>
peak intensities.<br>
•	Synchrotron XRD shall hereinafter refer to powder X-ray diffraction data<br>
collected  at  Brookhaven  National   Labs  on  beamline  XI OB  with  a<br>
monochromatic radiation wavelength of 0.8695 A using Debye-Scherrer<br>
geometry.    Samples were first calcined in air at 600°C for 3 hours to<br>
remove the template.   The calcined samples were then sealed in 2 mm<br>
outside diameter quartz capillary tubes while out-gassing at 300 °C under<br>
vacuum (
Scintag XRD shall hereinafter refer to X-ray diffraction data collected with a Scintag X2 X-Ray Diffractometer equipped with a Peltier-cooled solid state detector, using copper K-alpha radiation. The diffraction data were recorded by step-scanning at 0.02 degrees two-theta, where theta is the Bragg angle, and a counting time of 0.3 second for each step. The interplanar spacing, d's, were calculated in Angstrom units, and the relative intensities of the lines, l/lo, where lo is the intensity of the strongest line, above background were determined by integrating the peak intensities<br>
J0073]	X-ray diffraction data for the calcined samples was obtained by<br>
subjecting the as-synthesized product to the following calcination procedure. About 2 grams of the as-synthesized product were heated from room temperature to 200°C under a flow of nitrogen at a rate of 2°C per minute. The temperature was held at 200°C for 30 minutes and then the sample was heated from 200°C to 650°C under nitrogen again at a rate of 2°C per minute. The sample was held at 650°C under nitrogen for 5-8 hours, whereafter the nitrogen was then replaced by air and the sample was kept at 650°C under air for 3 hours. The sample was then cooled to 200°C and kept at 200°C to prevent hydration. The hot sample was then transferred into the XRD sample cup and was covered by Mylar foil to prevent hydration.<br>
|0074]	DIFFaX analysis was used to determine the AEI/CHA ratio of the<br>
molecular sieves. For DIFFaX analysis, powder XRD diffraction patterns for varying ratios of AEI/CHA were generated using the DIFFaX program available from the International Zeolite Association (see also M. M. J. Treacy et al.,<br>
Proceedings of the Royal Chemical Society, London, A (1991), Vol. 433, pp. 499-520 "Collection of Simulated XRD Powder Patterns for Zeolites" by M. M. J. Treacy and J. B. Higgins, 2001, Fourth Edition, published on behalf of the Structure Commission of the International Zeolite Association). Table 1 gives the DIFFaX input file used to simulate the XRD diffraction pattern of a 50/50 inter-growth. For the purposes of this analysis, calculations were based on a random distribution of the layers. Such calculations are used for statistical purposes only, and do not mean that the true nature of the material is necessarily random.(O 2- 	122 	0 	.18081 	0 	.34223 	0 	.06605 	3 	. 00 	1 	.0 <br>

calculated by DIFFaX for single intergrown zeolite phases having various AEI/CHA ratios, normalized to the highest peak of the entire set, i.e. the peak at about 9.6 29 for the 100% CHA case which was set to 100. The diffractograms were simulated using the following parameter settings: all Si AE]_CHA X=l.54056, PSEUDO-VO1GT 0.1 -0.036; line broadening: 0.009: 0.6. A non-<br><br>
linear least-squares procedure ("DIFFaX Analysis") was then used to refine the contribution of one or more phases, and of the background and the 20 shift required to fit the experimental profile. An intergrowth sensitive region (see e.g. Figure 3) was always chosen in order to maximize the sensitivity of the calculations. Alternatively, a manual trial-and-error fit can be performed for identifying the type and magnitude of the contributing phases, the background counts and the 26 shift. For materials characterized by the presence of more than one intergrown phase, the contribution of AEI and CHA was calculated by a least squares analysis method, summing the AEI and CHA contribution of each intergrown phases. For Synchrotron XRDs, the comparison with the DIFFaX simulated patterns was done by converting the experimental XRD patterns to CuKal (X= 1.54056 A).<br>
|0076]	In addition, the 13C MAS (magic-angle spinning) NMR spectra<br>
were obtained using a Chemagnetics® CMXII-200 spectrometer operating at a<br>
static field of 4.7 T (199.9 MHz 'H, 50.3 MHz !3C). The as-synthesized samples<br>
were loaded in MAS ZrOa NMR rotors (5-mm o.d.) and spun at the magic angle.<br>
The 13C MAS NMR (or Bloch decay) experiments were performed using a<br>
doubly-tuned probe by applying a (90°) 13C pulse followed by 13C data<br>
acquisition. A !H-13C dipolar-decoupling field of about 62-kHz was used during<br>
13C data acquisition. The 13C Bloch decay spectra were obtained at 8-kHz MAS<br>
using a pulse delay of about 60-sec. The free-induction decays thus obtained were<br>
Fourier transformed (with a 25 Hz exponential line broadening filter). The I3C<br>
chemical shifts are referenced with respect to an external solution of tetramethyl<br>
silane (TMS 6c = 0.0 ppm), using hexamethyl benzene as a secondary standard.<br>
One or more of the none-overlapping regions can be taken and its relative<br>
intensity determined. This can in turn be converted into mole ratio of the specific<br>
template whereby the relative contribution of one template versus the other can be<br>
calculated. All solid-state NMR measurements were done at room temperature.<br>
|0077]	TEM analysis included both Bright-Field TEM imaging (BF-TEM)<br>
and High-Resolution TEM imaging (HR-TEM).<br><br>
[0078]	TEM   data  were  obtained  by  crushing  individual   as-calcined<br>
samples into fines (
[0079]	HR-TEM data were obtained by embedding the calcined samplez<br>
in LR White hard grade resin (The London Resin Co., UK). Then, without adding the curing accelerator; the resin was thermally cured at 80°C for at least 3 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere. Electron transparent thin sections were cut at ambient temperature using a Boeckeler Powertome XL ultra-microtome equipped with a diamond knife. The thin sections were collected on lacey carbon TEM grids. HR-TEM analysis was done in a Philips CM12T transmission electron microscope at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The crystals were carefully oriented with the appropriate zone axis parallel to the electron beam and high-resolution TEM images were recorded on photographic plate at a nominal magnification of 100,000x.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
|0080]	0.286 ml of a 23.5 mg/ml aqueous solution of A1(N03)3-9H2O was<br>
added to a mixture of 8.060 ml of an aqueous solution of N,N-diethyl-2,6-dimethylpiperidinium hydroxide, DEDMP* OH", (0.6008 molar) and 1.000 ml of an aqueous solution of N,N,N-tri-methyl-l-adamantylammonium hydroxide, TMAA4 OH", (0.5379 molar). 2.400 ml of tetraethylorthosilicate was then added to this composition and the resultant mixture was continuously stirred in a sealed container for at least 2-3 hours at room temperature until all the tetraethylorthosilicate was completely hydrolyzed. To the resultant clear solution was added 0.234 ml of a 48wt% aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid which immediately resulted in the production of a slurry. This slurry was further homogenized by stirring and exposure to air for evaporation of water and ethanol until a thick slurry mixture was obtained. Extra water was further evaporated from the slurry mixture under static conditions to give 2672 mg of a dry gel solid having the following molar composition:<br>
SiO2 : 0.00083A12O3 : 0.45DEDMP : 0.05TMAA : 0.6F : 5.0H2O<br>

The resulting mixture of solids was transferred to a Teflon®-lined 5 ml pressure reactor and crystallized at 150°C for 65 hours under slow rotation (about 60 rpm). After cooling, the resultant solid was recovered by centrifuging, washed with distilled water, and dried at 100°C to give 775 mg of a white microcrystalline solid (29.0% yield based on the weight of the dry gel). The as-synthesized product had the X-ray diffraction pattern summarized in Table 2 below. The calcined product had the Scintag X-ray diffraction pattern shown in Figure 2.<br>
[0082]	DIFFaX analysis was conducted on the X-ray pattern of Figure 2<br>

experiments using the same starting materials in the same proportions as Example 1 but with the crystallization temperatures being 135°C and 175°C respectively. DIFFaX analysis was conducted as described in example 1 on the Synchrotron X-ray diffraction pattern of the calcined product of the 175°C synthesis and showed the presence of two intergrown AEI7CHA phases, namely about 78wt% of a first<br>
intergrown phase having an AE1/CHA ratio of 5/95 and and about 22 wt% of a second intergrown phase having an AE1/CHA ratio of 95/5, which corresponds to a weighted average AE1/CHA ratio of about 25/75.<br>
|0085]	13C MAS NMR analysis of the product of the 175°C synthesis<br>
showed the presence of DEDMP (the AEI directing agent) and TMAA (the CHA<br>
directing agent) in a molar ratio of 50/50 in the as-synthesized product.   This<br>
contrasts with a DEDMP:TMAA molar ratio of 90/10 in the synthesis mixture.<br>
[0086]	A high resolution transmission electron micrograph of the product<br>
of the 175°C synthesis is shown in Figure 4 and confirms the presence of twinned/faulted CHA crystals with intercalated regions of faulted AEI phase material.<br>

DEDMP/TMAA in the synthesis mixture being 1.0. DIFFaX analysis on the Synchrotron X-ray diffraction pattern of the as-calcined product showed the product to be pure CHA. In addition, 13C MAS NMR analysis showed the presence of only TMAA (the CHAdirecting agent) in the as-synthesized product. A HR-TEM transmission electron micrograph of the product is shown in Figure 5. No presence of faulting is apparent in the HR-TEM image. The Fourier Transform of the HR-TEM image shows sharp spots and no streaks, which is indicative of a regular stacking and of the absence of stacking faults or twins. No faults were observed in the 500 chards produced for the TEM analysis.<br>

corresponds to a weighted average AEI/CHA ratio of about 8.5/91.5. 13C MAS NMR analysis showed the presence of DEDMP (the AEI directing agent) and TMAA (the CHA directing agent) in a molar ratio of 23/77 in the as-synthesized product.<br>

trimethyladamantammonium hydroxide, and 3.22 g deionized water were added<br>
sequentially to a 23 ml Teflon lined Parr autoclave. To the resultant solution 0.05<br>
g of aluminum hydroxide (Teheis F-2000 dried gel, 50% AljOs) was added and<br>
the solution was mixed until it cleared. 0.60 g fumed silica (Cab-O-Sil, M5 grade,<br>
