[DESCRIPTION]<br>
[Invention Title]<br>
A METHOD OF ALLOCATING RESOURCE-AREA IN WIRELESS ACCESS<br>
SYSTEM<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless access system, and more particularly to a<br>
packet transmission method for frequent packet transmission and a method of allocating radio<br>
resources in the wireless communication system.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
A broadband wireless access system to transmit a packet to user equipment (UE) based<br>
on an IP-based Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service is described below. VoIP traffic is<br>
created with a fixed size having a fixed period within a VoIP codec. VoIP communication may<br>
be classified into a talk-spurt period and a silence period. During the talk-spurt period, a speech<br>
mode is maintained between users. During the silence period, the user listens to the other party<br>
without talking to the other party. The silence period may occupy 50% or more of a general<br>
call session.<br>
Therefore, in order to allocate different amounts of bandwidths to the talk-spurt period<br>
and the silence period, a variety of voice codecs may be used. A representative example of the<br>
voice codec is an adaptive multi-rate (AMR) for use in a Global System for Mobile<br>
communication (GSM) and a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS).<br>
Voice data is not generated during the silence period. If the bandwidth is allocated to<br>
the silence period, radio resources may be wasted. In order to prevent this problem, VoIP<br>
supports a silence suppression scheme. According to the silence suppression scheme, a vocoder<br>
for generating the VoIP traffic does not generate traffic data. However, the vocoder periodically<br><br>
generates comfort noise to inform the other user that the call is still ongoing. For example, the<br>
vocoder based on the above-mentioned AMR codec generates a fixed-sized packet at intervals of<br>
20 ms in the talk-spurt period, and generates the comfort noise at intervals of 160 ms in the<br>
silence period.<br>
In order to perform resource allocation of traffic data, which has a fixed-sized constant<br>
period such as a VoIP, a Node-B or base station (BS) may fixedly assign a predetermined region<br>
to a specific UE. For example, the BS assigns the region as large as the initially-defined size to<br>
the UE capable of supporting the VoIP service. The BS may also inform the UE of the<br>
assigned resource region information using a control channel or a control message such as a<br>
UL-MAP or a DL-MAP. Accordingly, the control channel or the control message, which is<br>
initially transmitted, may also include period information of the next allocation region.<br>
From the next period, the BS may successively assign a corresponding region without<br>
any specified notification associated with the above region which has been notified to the mobile<br>
station (MS), using the initially-transmitted control channel or the initially-transmitted control<br>
message. Therefore, the MS transmits the VoIP packet to the assigned region using region<br>
information which has been initially assigned on the map and transmits the VoIP packet from the<br>
next period to the same region using period information.<br>
For example, when the frame length is set to 5 ms in consideration of the VoIP service<br>
and a frame period assigned to the MS for VoIP packet transmission is set to 4 frames, the frame<br>
period assigned to the MS for the VoIP packet transmission may be changed to another<br>
according to service characteristics. Specifically, if the same VoIP service is used, the frame<br>
period assigned for VoIP packet transmission may be defined in different ways according to<br>
individual elements such as system characteristic and VoIP service status. For example, the<br>
system characteristic may be changed according to the frame length and the VoIP service status<br><br>
may be either the talk-spurt period or the silence period.<br>
The BS located at an initial frame informs the MS of the allocation region information to<br>
transmit the VoIP packet via the UL-MAP. If the BS is located at a fourth or eighth frame<br>
corresponding to each period, it does not inform the region information via the UL-MAP and<br>
assigns only the region for VoIP packet transmission.<br>
In this case, the period assigned for the VoIP packet transmission may be 4 frames or 20<br>
ms.<br>
The MS stores region allocation information contained in the UL-MAP message received<br>
from the initial frame. Therefore, the MS can transmit the VoIP packet via a corresponding<br>
region although the UL-MAP message is not additionally received from the fourth and eighth<br>
frames corresponding to the resource allocation period. Accordingly, the BS is fixed to a single<br>
VoIP connection due to the VoIP traffic characteristic and can persistently assign resources to<br>
this VoIP connection.<br>
If a control message for assigning a new transmission region is lost in a wired or wireless<br>
downlink, the conventional system has a disadvantage in that individual transmission region<br>
information recognized by the MS and the BS is unavoidably different from each other.<br>
Therefore, in case of the downlink, the MS is unable to receive the VoIP packet from the BS.<br>
In case of the uplink, although the MS transmits the VoIP packet via the second<br>
transmission region, the BS may assign the second transmission region to another MS, resulting<br>
in unexpected problems. In other words, if the MS transmits the VoIP packet via the second<br>
transmission region, a packet transmission by another MS may fail. If the system uses an<br>
incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) scheme, the number of retransmission will be increased,<br>
resulting in unexpected problems.<br>
[Disclosure]<br><br>
[Technical Problem]<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a packet transmission method for<br>
resource allocation in a broadband wireless access system that substantially obviates one or more<br>
problems due to limitations and disadvantages of the related art.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for assigning a resource area<br>
and a control channel to provide the mobile station (MS) with the persistent service.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for solving the problems<br>
encountered when the mobile station (MS) does not receive the control message for assigning the<br>
radio resources.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for reassigning the<br>
transmission area when the mobile station (MS) does not receive the control message for<br>
assigning the VoIP packet transmission area during the UL/DL VoIP packet transmission.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for solving the problems<br>
encountered when the radio resources for VoIP packet transmission/reception are assigned,<br>
modified, and deleted.<br>
[Technical Solution]<br>
The present invention has been devised to solve the above-mentioned objects.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method of allocating a radio resource in<br>
a wireless access system is provided. The method includes receiving a control message<br>
associated with radio resource allocation for transmitting uplink data to the BS, wherein the<br>
control message comprises a first persistent uplink allocation information element comprising<br>
first resource allocation information associated with a first resource allocation region for<br>
transmitting the uplink data of the MS and transmitting an acknowledgment (ACK) message<br>
from the MS to the BS in response to successfully receiving the first persistent uplink allocation<br><br>
information element.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention, the method further includes transmitting the uplink<br>
data to the BS by the MS via the assigned first resource allocation region. If the ACK message is<br>
not received from the MS, the first persistent allocation information element is retransmitted.<br>
Preferably, the retransmission of the first persistent allocation information element occurs after a<br>
predetermined number of frames after not receiving the ACK message. Preferably, a payload<br>
size of the uplink data is fixed and the uplink data includes an IP-based Voice over Internet<br>
Protocol (VoIP) data.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the first resource allocation information<br>
comprises at least one of orthogonal frequency division mulitiplxing access (OFDMA) symbol<br>
offset, subchannel offset, and information of OFDMA slot. Besides, the first persistent uplink<br>
allocation information element further comprises first ACK information associated with ACK<br>
transmission region, and the ACK message is transmitted via an ACK transmission region which<br>
is indicated by the first ACK information.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the first persistent uplink allocation<br>
information element futher comprises a field for indicating whether the first resource allocation<br>
region is allocated or de-allocated.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the method also includes storing the first<br>
persistent uplink allocation information element in the MS. The method may further include<br>
receiving a second persistent uplink allocation information element comprising second resource<br>
allocation information associated with a second resource allocation region for transmitting the<br>
uplink data. Furthermore, the method may include storing the second persistent uplink allocation<br>
information element and transmitting an acknowledgment (ACK) signal from the MS to the BS<br>
in response to successfully receiving the second persistent uplink allocation information element.<br><br>
The method may include transmitting the uplink data to the BS via the assigned second<br>
resource allocation region. The MS continues transmitting the uplink data to the BS via the first<br>
resource allocation region until a second persistent uplink allocation information element<br>
associated with using a second resource allocation region is received.<br>
In the other aspect of present invention, the second persistent uplink allocation<br>
information element further comprises second ACK information associated with ACK<br>
transmission region, and the ACK message is transmitted via an ACK transmission region which<br>
is indicated by the second ACK information.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method of allocating a radio<br>
resource in a wireless access system includes receiving a control message associated with radio<br>
resource allocation for receiving downlink data from the BS, wherein the control message<br>
comprises a first persistent downlink allocation information element comprising first resource<br>
allocation information associated with a first resource allocation region for receiving the<br>
downlink data from the BS and transmitting an acknowledgment (ACK) message from the MS to<br>
the BS in response to successfully receiving the first persistent downlink allocation information<br>
element.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention, the method further includes receiving the downlink<br>
data from the BS via the assigned first resource allocation region. Preferably, a payload size of<br>
the downlink data is fixed.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the method further includes receiving a second<br>
persistent downlink allocation information element including second resource allocation<br>
information associated with a second resource allocation region for receiving downlink data. The<br>
method may further include storing the second persistent downlink allocation information<br>
element and transmitting an acknowledgment (ACK) signal from the MS to the BS in response<br><br>
to successfully receiving the second persistent downlink allocation information element.<br>
The method may also include receiving the downlink data from the BS via the assigned<br>
second resource allocation region. The MS continues receiving the downlink data from the BS<br>
via the first resource allocation region until a second persistent downlink allocation information<br>
element associated with using a second resource allocation region is received. The first resource<br>
persistent downlink allocation information may comprise at least one of OFDMA symbol offset,<br>
subchannel offset, and information of OFDMA slot.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, the method of allocating a radio<br>
resource in a wireless access system includes transmitting a control message associated with<br>
radio resource allocation for communicating data to the MS, wherein the control message<br>
comprises a first persistent allocation information element comprising first resource allocation<br>
information associated with a first resource allocation region for communicating the data and<br>
receiving an acknowledgment (ACK.) message from the MS in response to successfully receiving<br>
the first persistent allocation information element. The method may further include<br>
communicating the data via the assigned first resource allocation region. Preferably, a payload<br>
size of the data is fixed.<br>
In an aspect of the present invention, the method further includes transmitting a second<br>
persistent allocation information element including second resource allocation information<br>
associated with a second resource allocation region for communicating the data. The method<br>
may further include storing the second persistent allocation information element and receiving an<br>
acknowledgment (ACK) signal from the MS in response to successfully receiving the second<br>
persistent allocation information element.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, the method may also include transmitting the<br>
data to the MS via the assigned second resource allocation region. The BS continues receiving<br><br>
the data from the MS via the first resource allocation region until a second persistent allocation<br>
information element associated with using a second resource allocation region is received by the<br>
MS.<br>
In the other aspect of the present invention, the first persistent allocation information<br>
element further comprises ACK transmission region allocation information, and the ACK<br>
message is received via an ACK transmission region which is indicated by the ACK<br>
transmission region allocation information. At this time, the first persistent uplink allocation<br>
information futher comprises a field for indicating whether the first resource allocation region is<br>
allocated or de-allocated. Moreover, the first resource persistent downlink allocation information<br>
comprises at least one of OFDMA symbol offset, subchannel offset, and information of OFDMA<br>
slot.<br>
It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following<br>
detailed description of the present invention are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to<br>
provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.<br><br>
[Advantageous Effects]<br>
The present invention has the following effects.<br>
Firstly, although a control message for assigning the transmission area to provide the<br>
VoIP service is lost or has faulty or erroneous operations, the present invention can quickly<br>
retransmit the control message, such that it can solve the lost or damaged packet generated<br>
between the mobile station (MS) and the base station (BS).<br>
Secondly, the present invention can solve the problem encountered when a transmission<br>
area recognized by each mobile station (MS) is different from that of the base station (BS) in the<br>
uplink. That is, the present invention prevents the lost VoIP packet encountered when the<br>
mobile station (MS) and the base station (BS) have recognized different transmission areas.<br>
Also, the mobile station (MS) has information of another area instead of an area assigned to the<br>
mobile station (MS) itself, such that the collision problem encountered when another mobile<br>
station (MS) transmits the packet can be solved.<br>
Thirdly, although the control message for assigning the transmission area is damaged or<br>
lost, the present invention can immediately re-assign the transmission area. Therefore, the<br>
present invention can solve the problem that the mobile station (MS) is unable to recognize the<br>
downlink transmission area assigned from the base station (BS).<br>
Fourthly, the present invention can reduce an amount of overhead of the MAP message to<br>
implement a periodic traffic pattern and a connection of fixed-sized payload (e.g., data<br>
information).<br>

Prior to describing the present invention, it should be noted that most terms disclosed in<br>
the present invention correspond to general terms well known in the art, but some terms have<br>
been selected by the applicant as necessary and will hereinafter be disclosed in the following<br>
description of the present invention. Therefore, it is preferable that the terms defined by the<br>
applicant be understood on the basis of their meanings in the present invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a wireless access system. In more detail, the present<br>
invention provides the packet transmission method when the packet is frequently transmitted and<br>
a method of assigning radio resources in the wireless access system.<br>
The order of operations disclosed in the embodiments of the present invention may be<br>
changed. Some components or characteristics of any embodiment may also be included in<br>
other embodiments, or may be replaced with those of other embodiments as necessary.<br>
The following embodiments of the present invention will be disclosed on the basis of a<br>
data communication relationship between the BS and the MS. The BS is used as a terminal<br>
node of a network via which the BS can directly communicate with the MS. Specific operations<br>
to be conducted by the MS in the present invention may also be conducted by an upper node of<br>
the BS as necessary. Various operations for enabling the BS to communicate with the MS in a<br>
network composed of several network nodes including the BS may be conducted by the BS or<br>
other network nodes other than the BS.<br><br>
The base station (BS) may also be called as a fixed station, Node-B, eNode-B (eNB), or<br>
an access point as necessary. The mobile station (MS) may also be called as a user equipment<br>
(UE) or a mobile subscriber station (MSS) as necessary.<br>
The following embodiments of the present invention will disclose the VoIP service as an<br>
exemplary service which requires frequent packet transmission. However, it should be noted<br>
that the present invention is not limited to the VoIP service and can also be applied to other<br>
services requesting frequent packet transmission/reception. A packet transmission method for<br>
VoIP and the resource allocation method for the same VoIP under the condition that the packet<br>
transmission is frequently required will be described hereinafter.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an uplink case in which the MS transmits the VoIP packet to the BS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the MS and the BS determine whether the resource allocation method is<br>
made available while the VoIP service is generated in S11.<br>
If it is determined that the resource allocation is made available in S101, the BS includes<br>
"VoIP_UL_IE" in the UL-MAP message and assigns the radio transmission region for providing<br>
the VoIP service in S102. The UL-MAP message is used as a control message and includes a<br>
radio transmission region which enables the MS to transmit the VoIP packet to the BS. The BS<br>
assigns a first transmission region to the MS via the UL-MAP message.<br>
When the MS receives the UL-MAP message from the BS, the MS stores allocation<br>
information for the first transmission region included in the UL-MAP message in S103.<br>
Subsequently, the MS transmits the VoIP packet to the BS via the first transmission region<br>
which has been assigned from the BS in S104.<br>
In order to assign the traffic resources having a fixed-sized constant period, such as the<br>
VoIP packet, the BS fixedly assigns a first transmission region to the MS in S102. Therefore,<br>
the BS can continuously assign the first transmission region to the MS without notifying other<br><br>
messages via an initial transmission control channel or an initial transmission control message.<br>
The VoIP packet is transmitted at intervals of a predetermined time, such that the MS<br>
goes to the next period, for example, a lapse of 20 ms, and transmits the next VoIP packet to the<br>
BS via the first transmission region in S105. While the MS transmits/receives the VoIP service<br>
to/from the BS, channel environments or data transmission environments may be unexpectedly<br>
deteriorated and it may be difficult to implement packet transmission/reception via the first<br>
transmission region. Therefore, the BS includes "VoIP_UL_IE" in the control message<br>
"UL-MAP" and assigns a second transmission region to the MS. In this case, the second<br>
transmission region is assigned to a specific location different from that of the first transmission<br>
region in S106.<br>
When the MS receives the above mentioned UL-MAP message in S106, the first<br>
transmission region for the VoIP service is updated with the second transmission region included<br>
in the UL-MAP message in S107. Subsequently, the MS transmits the VoIP packet to the BS via<br>
the second transmission region in S108.<br>
The BS receiving the VoIP packet via the second transmission region may need to<br>
change a current transmission region to another transmission region, if necessary. Therefore, in<br>
order to assign a third transmission region that is different from the second transmission region<br>
to the MS, the BS transmits the UL-MAP message including "VoIP_UL_IE" to the MS in S109.<br>
However, the UL-MAP message may be lost during wired or wireless transmission in<br>
S109 such that the MS does not receive the UL-MAP message. Alternatively, although the MS<br>
receives the UL-MAP message, it may be unable to detect the UL-MAP message due to the<br>
faulty or erroneous operation of the UL-MAP message.<br>
In this case, the MS is unable to recognize the information of the third transmission<br>
region in S109 and transmits the VoIP packet to the BS using the previous information, for<br><br>
example, information of the second transmission region for the next period in S110. Therefore,<br>
if the BS assigns the second transmission region for the VoIP service of another MS in SI 10, at<br>
least two MSs transmit the VoIP packet to the same second transmission region. As a result,<br>
packets may collide with each other and the BS may not receive such packets. Further, the BS<br>
does not receive the packet via the third transmission region assigned to the MS and is unable to<br>
receive the packet normally from the MS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, it is noted that S201-S203 of FIG. 2 are similar to S101-S103 of<br>
FIG. 1. In other words, in a downlink, the BS transmits the first transmission region to the MS<br>
using the DL-MAP message acting as the control message in S202. The MS stores allocation<br>
information of the first transmission region in S 203 and is ready to receive the VoIP packet from<br>
the BS.<br>
The BS transmits the VoIP packet to the MS via the first transmission region in S204. In<br>
this case, in order to assign radio resources for traffic, such as VoIP packet, having a fixed-sized<br>
period, the BS fixedly assigns the first transmission region to the MS in S202. Therefore, the<br>
BS can continuously assign the transmission region to the MS without notifying other messages<br>
via an initial transmission control channel or an initial transmission control message.<br>
The VoIP packet is transmitted at intervals of a predetermined time such that the BS goes<br>
to the next period, for example, a lapse of 20 ms, and transmits the next VoIP packet to the MS<br>
via the first transmission region in S205. While the MS transmits/receives the VoIP service<br>
to/from the BS, channel environments or data transmission environments may be unexpectedly<br>
deteriorated and it may be difficult to perform packet transmission/reception via the first<br>
transmission region. In this case, the BS includes "VoIP_DL_IE" in the control message<br>
"DL-MAP" and may assign a second transmission region that is different from the first<br>
transmission region to the MS in S206.<br><br>
When the MS receives the above mentioned DL-MAP message in S206, the second<br>
transmission region contained in the DL-MAP message is updated in S207. The BS transmits the<br>
VoIP packet to the MS via the second transmission region assigned to the MS in S208.<br>
The BS providing the VoIP service via the second transmission region may need to<br>
change a current VoIP packet transmission region to another transmission region. Therefore, in<br>
order to assign a third transmission region that is different from the second transmission region,<br>
the BS transmits the DL-MAP message including "VoIP_DL_IE" to the MS in S209.<br>
However, the DL-MAP message may be lost during wired or wireless transmission in<br>
S209 and the MS may not receive the DL-MAP message. Alternatively, although the MS<br>
receives the DL-MAP message, it may be unable to detect the DL-MAP message due to the<br>
faulty or erroneous operation of the DL-MAP message.<br>
In this case, the MS is unable to receive the DL-MAP message normally in S209 and<br>
unable to recognize information of the third transmission region. Therefore, the BS continues<br>
to transmit the VoIP packet periodically to the MS via the second transmission region and the<br>
MS is unable to receive the VoIP packet via the third transmission region.<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 show that the BS assigns the resource region to the MS using the control<br>
message "MAP IE". However, when the MS receives the MAP IE message abnormally and the<br>
BS changes a transmission region for the VoIP service to another region, an unexpected problem<br>
may arise during packet transmission because the MS and the BS have information of different<br>
transmission regions.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a VoIP service is generated between the MS and the BS in S301. The<br>
BS and the MS negotiate with each other about the persistent resource allocation method used<br>
when the VoIP service is generated in S301. According to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the persistent resource allocation is available or the persistent allocation is enabled.<br><br>
The BS assigns the first transmission region to transmit/receive the VoIP packet to/from<br>
the MS using the control message such as the MAP message in S302.<br>
The BS transmits/receives the VoIP packet to/from the MS via the first transmission<br>
region. In other words, in the uplink, the MS transmits the VoIP packet to the BS via the first<br>
transmission region and in the downlink, the BS transmits the VoIP packet to the MS via the first<br>
transmission region.<br>
While the BS transmits the VoIP service to the MS, user environment may be changed or<br>
communication quality may be deteriorated. In this case, the BS determines to change a packet<br>
transmission region for the VoIP service in S303.<br>
The BS assigns the changed second transmission region to the MS. The BS transmits or<br>
receives the VoIP service to/from the MS via the second transmission region in S304.<br>
The BS may use the control message in order to assign the second transmission region to<br>
the MS in S304. A message characterized by its solidity is used as the control message which<br>
includes a MAP message. The MAP message (DL-MAP/UL-MAP) is used to assign unique<br>
resource for each user. This MAP message is a MAC management message which dynamically<br>
informs the MS of the resource allocation result at intervals of each frame.<br>
In the downlink, the UL-MAP message designates the location of sub-channel<br>
dynamically assigned to each MS and the number of the sub-channel. In the uplink, the<br>
DL-MAP message designates the location of sub-channel dynamically assigned to each MS and<br>
the number of the sub-channel. In particular, the DL-MAP message is a broadcast message<br>
which indicates the set of information associated with total connection managed by a single BS.<br>
For example, the DL-MAP message may include the principal information, band allocation<br>
information, frame construction information, and ACK/NACK information.<br>
The following table 1 shows an example of the VoIP UL-MAP information element<br><br>
(VoIP_UL IE) which may be used to perform resource allocation, modify the resource<br>
allocation, and delete the same.<br><br><br><br>
Referring back to FIG. 3, in order to assign the second transmission region, the BS<br>
transmits the control message to the MS in S304. In this case, the MS receives the control<br>
message and can recognize the second transmission region in S305. If the MS receives the<br>
control message and recognizes the second transmission region ('Yes' in S305), it transmits or<br>
receives the VoIP packet to/from the BS via the second transmission region in S306.<br>
The MS may not receive the control message in S305 ('No') due to a loss of the control<br>
message during wired or wireless transmission. Or, even if the control message is received by<br>
the MS, it may not be recognized due to errors in the control message. In this case, the BS<br><br>
reallocates the second transmission region to the MS using a specific algorithm in S307. This<br>
step may be repeated until the second transmission region equal to a new transmission region is<br>
recognized. The number of repetition may be determined according to the communication<br>
environment and a system requirement.<br>
In order to reallocate the second transmission region, a variety of algorithms may be used<br>
in S307. According to one of various algorithms, if a control message for allocating the second<br>
transmission region is received normally, an acknowledgment (ACK) signal for the control<br>
message is transmitted to the BS such that the MS indicates that the second transmission region<br>
has been normally recognized.<br>
If the MS does not receive the control message normally, it is unable to transmit the ACK<br>
signal. Provided that the BS transmits the control message for assigning the transmission<br>
region and does not receive the ACK signal from the MS, it may retransmit the above-mentioned<br>
control message after a lapse of a predetermined number of frames, for example, N frames, in the<br>
next frame or system.<br>
According to another algorithm, the BS determines the presence or absence of a signal of<br>
the second transmission region in S307 such that it may reallocate the second transmission<br>
region. In this case, the BS does not use the ACK signal and determines whether the signal is<br>
transmitted from the MS to the second transmission region. Further, other types of algorithms<br>
may also be used to assign the second transmission region.<br>
According to an embodiment of the present invention, a method for using the ACK signal<br>
to reply to the control message, which can assign, modify, or delete radio resources for the VoIP<br>
service, is described below. If the MS receives the VoIP-associated MAP IE message from the<br>
BS when the MAP IE message, such as VoIP_DL_IE VoIP_UL_IE, is used as a control message,<br>
the MS may transmit the ACK signal to the BS in response to the MAP IE message. In this<br><br>
case, the BS allocates the control channel to a designated frame such that the MS can transmit<br>
the ACK signal.<br>
The ACK signal transmitted from the MS to the BS in response to the control message<br>
may be an ACK/NACK or ACK message of a Hybid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ), or an<br>
ACK header. If the BS does not receive the ACK signal at a corresponding frame, the BS may<br>
retransmit the control message, which has been transmitted to the MS, to the designated frame,<br>
or may allocate radio resources to the MS using the radio-resource information pre-notified to<br>
the MS.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, in an uplink, the process for generating the VoIP service between the<br>
MS and the BS and allocating the first transmission region is equivalent to S101~S104 of FIG. 1.<br>
Therefore, these steps are omitted and the next steps are described in FIG. 4.<br>
The MS transmits the VoIP packet to the BS via the first transmission region assigned<br>
from the BS in S401. While the VoIP packet is transmitted or received, the transmission region<br>
may need to be changed to another region due to poor communication environments or some<br>
other reasons. In this case, the BS may allocate the second transmission region to the MS using<br>
the UL-MAP message (VoIP_UL_IE) acting as a control message in S402. Also, the BS may<br>
allocate a specific region capable of transmitting the ACK signal via the control message.<br>
When the MS receives the control message from the BS, the MS updates the second<br>
transmission region contained in the control message to a new transmission region in S403.<br>
When the MS has received the control message normally in S402, the MS transmits the ACK<br>
signal, such as HARQ, ARK, ACK message or ACK header, to the BS in order to reply to the<br>
normally-received control message in S404. Then, the MS transmits the VoIP packet to the BS<br>
via the second transmission region, which was assigned as the new transmission region from the<br>
BS, in S405.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 5, in a downlink, the process for generating the VoIP service between<br>
the MS and the BS and allocating the first transmission region is equivalent to S201-S204 of<br>
FIG. 2. Therefore, the same steps are omitted and the next steps are described in FIG. 5.<br>
The BS transmits the VoIP packet to the MS via the first transmission region assigned to<br>
the MS in S501. While the VoIP packet is transmitted or received, the transmission region may<br>
need be changed to another region due to poor communication environments or some other<br>
reasons. In this case, the BS may allocate the second transmission region to the MS using the<br>
DL-MAP message (VoIP_DL_IE) acting as a control message in S502. Also, the BS may<br>
allocate a specific region capable of transmitting the ACK signal via the control message.<br>
If the MS receives the control message from the BS, the MS updates the second<br>
transmission region contained in the control message to a new transmission region in S503.<br>
When the MS has received the control message normally in S502, the MS can transmit the ACK<br>
signal, such as HARQ, ARK, ACK message or ACK header, to the BS in order to reply to the<br>
normally-received control message in S504.<br>
Then, the BS transmits the VoIP packet via the second transmission region, which was<br>
assigned to the MS as the new transmission region, in S505.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, in an uplink, the BS and the MS generate the VoIP service and the<br>
BS allocates the transmission region for providing the MS with the VoIP service. The<br>
above-mentioned operations are similar to S101-S104 of FIG. 1, and therefore, the same steps<br>
are omitted and the next steps are described in FIG. 6.<br>
The MS transmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region assigned from the BS<br>
in S601. While the BS transmits the VoIP service to the MS, it may need to change the radio<br>
resources assigned to the MS to other radio resources. In this case, the BS allocates the second<br>
transmission region to the MS using the UL-MAP message (VoIP_UL_IE) used as a control<br><br>
message in S602.<br>
However, it should be noted that the control message transmitted from the BS to the MS<br>
may be lost or damaged during wired or wireless transmission, or the MS may not recognize the<br>
control message due to faulty or erroneous operations. When the control message is lost, the<br>
MS is unable to transmit the ACK signal associated with the above-mentioned control message<br>
of S602 to the BS in S603.<br>
The BS transmits the control message in S602 and waits for the ACK signal to determine<br>
whether the MS has recognized the second transmission region. However, since the MS is<br>
unable to transmit the ACK signal in S603 because the control message has been lost, the BS<br>
determines that the second transmission region has not been recognized by the MS. Therefore,<br>
the BS retransmits the UL-MAP message and reallocates the second transmission region in<br>
S604.<br>
The BS retransmits the UL-MAP message for reallocating the second transmission region<br>
to the MS after a lapse of a predetermined value, for example, N frames, as determined by the<br>
next fame or system in S604. The UL-MAP message is immediately retransmitted at the next<br>
frame after S603.<br>
The MS recognizes the second transmission region contained in the UL-MAP message<br>
retransmitted from the BS and updates the first transmission region for VoIP-packet transmission<br>
with the second transmission region in S605. Then, the MS transmits the ACK signal to the BS<br>
in response to the received UL-MAP message in S606 and transmits the VoIP packet via the<br>
second transmission region assigned from the BS. Even if the MS does not receive a new<br>
transmission region by the above described steps, the MS according to the present invention can<br>
quickly receive the transmission region from the BS such that it can effectively provide the VoIP<br>
service.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 7, in a downlink, the BS and the MS generate the VoIP service and the<br>
BS allocates the transmission region for providing the MS with the VoIP service. The<br>
above-mentioned operations are similar to S201 to S204 of FIG. 2, and therefore, the same steps<br>
are omitted and the next steps are described in FIG. 7.<br>
The BS transmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region assigned to the MS in<br>
S701. While the BS transmits the VoIP service to the MS, the radio resources assigned to the MS<br>
may need to be changed to other radio resources. In this case, the BS allocates the second<br>
transmission region to the MS using the DL-MAP message (VoIP_DL_IE) used as a control<br>
message in S702.<br>
However, it should be noted that the control message transmitted from the BS to the MS<br>
may be lost or damaged during wired or wireless transmission in S702, or the MS may not<br>
recognize the control message due to faulty or erroneous operations in S702. As a result, the<br>
MS is unable to transmit the ACK signal associated with the above-mentioned control message<br>
from S702 to the BS in S703.<br>
The BS transmits the control message in S702 and waits for the ACK signal to determine<br>
whether the MS has recognized the second transmission region. However, since the DL-MAP<br>
message transmitted from the BS has been lost in S702, the MS is unable to transmit the ACK<br>
signal. Therefore, the BS determines that the second transmission region has not been<br>
recognized by the MS and retransmits the DL-MAP message to reallocate the second<br>
transmission region in S704.<br>
The BS retransmits the DL-MAP message to reallocate the second transmission region to<br>
the MS after a lapse of a predetermined value, for example, N frames, determined by the next<br>
fame or system in S704. The DL-MAP message is retransmitted immediately at the next frame<br>
after S703.<br><br>
The MS recognizes the second transmission region contained in the DL-MAP message<br>
retransmitted from the BS and updates the first transmission region for VoIP-packet transmission<br>
with the second transmission region in S705. Then, the MS transmits the ACK signal to the BS<br>
in response to the received DL-MAP message in S706 and the BS transmits the VoIP packet to<br>
the MS via the assigned second transmission region in S 707. Accordingly, even if me MS has<br>
not received a new transmission region by the above described steps, the BS according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention can quickly reallocate the transmission region to provide<br>
the VoIP service effectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, in an uplink, the BS and the MS generate the VoIP service and the<br>
BS allocates the transmission region for providing the MS with the VoIP service. The<br>
above-mentioned operations are similar to steps S101~S104 of FIG. 1, and therefore, the same<br>
steps are omitted and only different steps are described with reference to FIG. 8.<br>
The MS transmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region assigned from the BS<br>
in S801. The resource-allocation region may need to be changed to another region during the<br>
VoIP packet communication between the BS and the MS. In this case, the BS may allocate the<br>
new second transmission region to the MS using the UL-MAP message (VoIP_UL_IE) used as a<br>
control message in S802.<br>
However, it should be noted that the control message transmitted from the BS to the MS<br>
may be lost or damaged during wired or wireless transmission or the MS may not recognize the<br>
control message due to faulty or erroneous operations. , When the UL-MAP message is lost in<br>
S802, the MS is unable to transmit the ACK signal via the above mentioned region, which has<br>
been allocated to the MS for ACK signal transmission, in S803.<br>
Since the BS has not received the ACK signal from the MS in S803, it does not allocate<br>
the first transmission region, which has been pre-assigned to the MS, to either another MS or<br><br>
another service. Also, the BS may allocate resources to the corresponding MS using the<br>
previous information.<br>
Since the MS has not received the UL-MAP message, it is unable to transmit the VoIP<br>
packet via the second transmission region. Therefore, the MS continues to transmit the VoIP<br>
packet to the BS via the pre-assigned first transmission region in S804.<br>
When the BS receives the VoIP packet from the MS via the first transmission region, it<br>
determines that the control message in S802 has not been received normally by the MS.<br>
Specifically, even after the BS assigns the second transmission region to the MS, when the MS<br>
retransmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region, the BS determines that the MS has<br>
not received the control message normally in S802.<br>
Therefore, after a lapse of the next frame or N frames of S803, the BS retransmits the<br>
UL-MAP message (VoIP_UL_IE) to the MS to allocate the second transmission region in S805.<br>
When the MS has received the UL-MAP message normally from the BS in S805, the MS<br>
transmits the ACK signal to the BS via a predetermined region for transmitting the ACK signal<br>
contained in the above-mentioned UL-MAP message in S806.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, in a downlink, the BS and the MS generate the VoIP service and the<br>
BS allocates the first transmission region for providing the MS with the VoIP service. The<br>
above-mentioned operations are similar to S201-S204 of FIG. 2, and therefore, the same steps<br>
are omitted and only different steps are described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
The BS transmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region assigned to the MS in<br>
S901. The resource-allocation region may need to be changed to another region during the VoIP<br>
packet communication between the BS and the MS. In this case, the BS may allocate the new<br>
second transmission region to the MS using the DL-MAP message (VoIP_DL_IE) used as a<br>
control message in S902.<br><br>
However, it should be noted that the control message transmitted from the BS to the MS<br>
may be lost or damaged during wired or wireless transmission in S902, or the control message<br>
may be received by the MS abnormally due to faulty or erroneous operations. In S902, the<br>
DL-MAP message has been lost, and therefore, the MS does not transmit the ACK signal via the<br>
above described region, which has been allocated from the BS to transmit the ACK signal, in<br>
S903.<br>
Since the BS has not received the ACK signal from the MS in S903, it does not allocate<br>
the first transmission region, which has been pre-allocated to the MS, to either another MS or<br>
another service. Also, the BS allocates resources to the corresponding MS using the previous<br>
information.<br>
As shown in S903, the BS has not received the ACK signal in response to the DL-MAP<br>
message of S902. Therefore, the BS determines that the MS has not recognized the second<br>
transmission region yet and transmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region in S904.<br>
When the BS has not received ACK signal from the MS, it determines that the MS has<br>
received the control message of S902 abnormally. Therefore, after a lapse of the next frame or<br>
the predetermined N frames of the S803, the BS retransmits the DL-MAP message<br>
(VoIP_DL_IE) to the MS to allocate the second transmission region in S905. When the MS has<br>
received the DL-MAP message normally from the BS in S905, the MS transmits the ACK signal<br>
to the BS via a predetermined region to transmit the ACK signal contained in the<br>
above-mentioned DL-MAP message in S906.<br>
As described above, if the radio resources for the VoIP service are allocated according to<br>
the present invention, FIGS. 4-9 show not only a method for allocating radio resources between<br>
the BS and the MS using the ACK signal, but also a method for recovering a synchronization<br>
failure. According to another embodiment of the present invention, a method is provided for<br><br>
determining whether there is a signal associated with a radio resource region assigned to the MS<br>
by the BS and retransmitting the control message according to the determined result.<br>
According to yet another embodiment, the present invention can solve the inconsistency in<br>
radio-resource-region allocation between the BS and the MS.<br>
For example, if no signal associated with the uplink traffic is detected as a signal of the<br>
radio-resource region which has been allocated to the MS, the BS determines that it has<br>
recognized another radio-resource region instead of the above radio-resource region having been<br>
assigned to the MS. Therefore, the BS retransmits the control message to reallocate the<br>
radio-resource region.<br>
In case of a downlink, the BS transmits the packet to a specific region pre-assigned to the<br>
MS in association with downlink traffic. However, if no signal is detected in the radio-resource<br>
region assigned to the MS, the BS determines that the MS has information different from that of<br>
the radio-resource region allocated by the BS in association with the downlink. Therefore, the<br>
MS retransmits the control message to reallocate the radio-resource region.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, in an uplink, the VoIP service is generated between the MS and the<br>
BS and the BS allocates the first transmission region for providing the MS with the VoIP service.<br>
The above-mentioned operations are similar to S101 ~S 104 of FIG. 1, and therefore, the same<br>
steps are omitted and only different steps are described with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
The MS transmits the VoIP packet via the first transmission region assigned from the BS<br>
to implement VoIP packet transmission in S1001. While the VoIP packet is transmitted or<br>
received, the transmission region may need to be changed to another region due to poor<br>
communication environments or some other reasons. In this case, the BS may allocate the<br>
second transmission region different from the first transmission region to the MS using the<br>
UL-MAP message (VoIP_UL_IE) acting as a control message in S1002.<br><br>
However, it should be noted that the above-mentioned UL-MAP message may be lost or<br>
damaged during wired or wireless transmission in S1002, or the MS may receive the UL-MAP<br>
message abnormally in S1002. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
UL-MAP message has been lost and the MS does not receive the UL-MAP message.<br>
Even if the MS has not received the UL-MAP message, the BS can allocate the second<br>
transmission region to the MS nonetheless in S1003. However, in S1003, the BS does not<br>
actually allocate the radio resource region to the MS using the control message. The UL-MAP<br>
message used as the control message is transmitted only when the transmission region needs to<br>
be changed to another region.<br>
Since the MS has not received the UL-MAP message in S1002, it is unable to transmit<br>
the VoIP packet in S1004. If the BS detects no signal in the second transmission region which<br>
has been assigned to the MS, it retransmits the UL-MAP message to the MS in order to<br>
reallocate the second transmission region to the MS in S1005.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, in a downlink, the VoIP service is generated between the MS and<br>
the BS and the BS allocates the first transmission region for providing the MS with the VoIP<br>
service. The above-mentioned operations are similar to S201-S204 of FIG. 1, and therefore,<br>
the same steps are omitted and only different steps are described with reference to FIG. 11.<br>
The BS assigns the first transmission region to the MS to transmit the VoIP packet and<br>
transmits the VoIP packet to the MS via the first transmission region in S1101. While the VoIP<br>
packet is communicated between the MS and the BS, a first transmission region for providing a<br>
current VoIP service may need to be changed to a new second transmission region. In this case,<br>
the BS may allocate the second transmission region different from the first transmission region<br>
to the MS using the DL-MAP message (VoIP_DL_IE) acting as a control message in S1102.<br>
However, it should be noted that the above-mentioned DL-MAP message may be lost or<br><br>
damaged during wired or wireless transmission in S1102, or the MS may receive the DL-MAP<br>
message abnormally in S1102. According to another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
DL-MAP message is lost and the MS receives no DL-MAP message.<br>
Even if the MS receives no DL-MAP message and does not recognize the second<br>
transmission region as a new transmission region, the BS can allocate the second transmission<br>
region to the MS nonetheless in S1103. However, in S1103, the BS does not actually allocate<br>
the radio-resource region to the MS using the control message. The DL-MAP message used as<br>
the control message is transmitted only when the transmission region needs to be changed to<br>
another region.<br>
The BS transmits the VoIP packet to the MS via the allocated second transmission region<br>
in S1104. However, although the BS transmits the VoIP packet to the MS via the second<br>
transmission region in S1104, the MS has recognized the first transmission region as the<br>
VoIP-service region. As a result, the MS is unable to receive the VoIP packet which has been<br>
transmitted to the second transmission region by the BS.<br>
Therefore, the MS is unable to transmit the ACK signal for the VoIP packet to the BS in<br>
S1105. The ACK signal of S1105 plays a unique role which is different from those of FIGS.<br>
4~9. In other words, the ACK signal in S1105 is equivalent to the ACK signal for the VoIP<br>
packet. The ACK signals of FIGS. 4-9 are related to the ACK signals for the control message.<br>
When the BS detects no signal in the second transmission region which has been assigned to the<br>
MS, it retransmits the DL-MAP message to the MS in order to reallocate the second transmission<br>
region to the MS in S1106.<br>
As described above, FIGS. 4 to 11 have depicted various embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The above-mentioned methods proposed by the above embodiments can be applied<br>
not only to the above described embodiments in which the radio resources are allocated, but also<br><br>
to the other cases in which the allocated resources are modified or deleted or new resources are<br>
continuously allocated.<br>
The present invention has the following effects. First, although a control message for<br>
assigning the transmission region to provide the VoIP service is lost or has faulty or erroneous<br>
operations, the present invention can quickly retransmit the control message such that it can<br>
solve the lost or damaged packet generated between the MS and the BS.<br>
Second, the present invention can solve the problem encountered when a transmission<br>
region recognized by each MS is different from that of the BS in the uplink. That is, the present<br>
invention prevents the lost VoIP packet encountered when the MS and the BS have recognized<br>
different transmission regions. Also, the MS has information of another region instead of a<br>
region assigned to the MS itself such that the collision problem encountered when another MS<br>
transmits the packet can be solved.<br>
Third, although the control message for assigning the transmission region is damaged or<br>
lost, the present invention can immediately re-assign the transmission region. Therefore, the<br>
present invention can solve the problem when the MS is unable to recognize the downlink<br>
transmission region assigned from the BS.<br>
Fourth, the present invention can reduce an amount of overhead of the MAP message to<br>
implement a periodic traffic pattern and a connection of fixed-sized payload, for example, data<br>
information.<br>
The above-mentioned messages and parameters are disclosed for only illustrative<br>
purposes of the present invention. If required, other messages or other parameters may also be<br>
used to implement the same purpose as that of the present invention. It should be noted that<br>
most terminology disclosed in the present invention is defined in consideration of functions of<br>
