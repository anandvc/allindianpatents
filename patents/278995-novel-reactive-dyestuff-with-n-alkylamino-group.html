NOVEL REACTIVE DYESTUFF WITH N-ALKYLAMINO GROUP<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel reactive dyestuff with a<br>
N-alkylamino bridge group and, more particularly, to a novel reactive<br>
dyestuff suitable for exhaust dyeing, cold batch-up dyeing, continuous<br>
dyeing, printing and digital spray printing materials that contain hydroxyl<br>
group or polyamine fibers.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
An.azo dyestuff, where the chromophore thereof is composed of azo<br>
components and coupling components, can be widely employed and used as<br>
a reactive dyestuff for heavy color dyeing, such as red, navy, blue, black and<br>
so on, owing to its broad color gamut and high extinction coefficient.<br>
Currently, the development of reactive dye is moving towards warm<br>
dyeing, higher fixation and better build up to meet the economic demands.<br>
Since sulphato-ethyl-sulphone (SES) reactive groups cannot meet<br>
customers' demands for cotton dyeing due to their poor resistance to<br>
alkaline, monochloro triazine (MCT) type dyestuffs are usually used for<br>
dyeing. However, the use of monochloro triazine (MCT) type dyestuffs in<br>
»<br>
dyeing consumes more energy and the dyed materials exhibit poor water<br>
fastness.<br>
For example, in U. S. Pat. No. 5,552,532, U. S. Pat. No. 5,931,975,<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5,717,078, U. S. Pat. No. 5,837,827 and U. S. Pat. No.<br>
5,831,038, such dyestuffs are developed.<br>
 <br>
However, the build up, hue-shift, levelness and wash fastness of the<br>
aforementioned novel dyestuffs cannot meet the market requirements.<br>
Thereby, it is desirable to improve the aforementioned properties.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel reactive dyestuff with a<br>
N-alkylamino bridge group, which exhibits the properties of improved<br>
fixation yield, excellent build up, high wash fastness and excellent wet<br>
fastness while dyeing cellulose fibers.<br>

For convenience in description, the compound is expressed as free<br>
acid in the specification. When produced or used, the dyestuffs of the<br>
present invention are often.presented as water-soluble salts. The salts<br>
suitable for the present invention may be the alkaline metal salts, alkaline<br>
earth metal salts, ammonium salts or organic amine salts; preferably, the<br>
salts are sodium salts, potassium salts, lithium salts, ammonium salts or<br>
triethanolamine salts.<br>
The dyestuffs according to the present invention can be prepared by<br>
a conventional method. The synthetic routine for preparing the dyestuffs is<br>
not strictly limited. For example, a chromophore may be first prepared and<br>
then a desired dyestuff is synthesized, or a chromophore may be<br>
synthesized in the process for preparing a dyestuff.<br>
The dyestuffs of the present invention can be applied to dye and<br>
print many kinds of fiber materials, particularly cellulose fiber materials<br>
and cellulose-included fiber materials. The examples of the fiber materials<br>
are not limited. It can be natural or regenerated cellulose fibers, such as<br>
cotton, hemp, linen, jute, ramie, mucilage rayon, as well as<br>
cellulose-included fiber materials. The dyestuffs of the present invention<br>
 <br>
can also be applied to dye and print fiber blended fabrics containing<br>
hydroxyl groups.<br>
The dyestuffs of the present invention can be applied to the fiber<br>
material and fixed on the fiber in various ways, particularly in the form of<br>
aqueous dyestuff solutions and printing pastes. They can be applied to dye<br>
and print cellulose fibers by exhaustion dyeing, continuous dyeing,<br>
cold-pad-batch dyeing, printing or digital printing.<br>
The dyeing or printing of the present invention can beproceeded by<br>
the conventional and usually known method. For example, exhaustion<br>
dyeing is applied by using separately or mixing the well-known inorganic<br>
salts (e.g. sodium sulfate and sodium chloride) and acid-binding agents (e.g.<br>
sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide). The amount of inorganic salts and<br>
alkali does not matter. The inorganic salts and alkali can be added either<br>
once or several times into the dyeing bath through traditional methods. In<br>
addition, dyeing assistant agents (such as a leveling agent, suspending agent<br>
and so on) can be added according to conventional methods. The range of<br>
dyeing temperature is from 40 °C to 90 °C. Preferably, the temperature for<br>
dyeing is from 50 °C to 70 °C.<br>
In the cold-pad-batch dyeing method, the material is padded by using<br>
the well-known inorganic salts (e.g. sodium sulfate and sodium chloride)<br>
and acid-binding agents (e.g. sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide). The<br>
padded fabric is rolled and stored at room temperature to allow dye fixation<br>
to take place.<br>
In the continuous dyeing method, two different methods exist. In the<br>
single-bath pad dyeing method, the material is padded according to the<br>
conventional method in the mixture of the well-known acid-binding agents<br>
 <br>
(e.g. sodium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate) and the pad liquid. The<br>
resultant material is then dried and color fixed by baking or steaming.<br>
In the two-bath pad dyeing method, the material is padded with a dye<br>
liquid and then dealt by a known inorganic neutral salt (e.g., sodium sulfate<br>
or sodium silicate). The dealt material is preferably dried and color-fixed by<br>
baking or steaming in the usual manner.<br>
In the textile printing method, such as the single printing method, the<br>
material is printed by using printing paste containing the known<br>
acid-binding agent (e.g., sodium bicarbonate) and is dried and color-fixed by<br>
baking or steaming.<br>
In the two-phase printing method, the material is dipped in a solution<br>
containing inorganic neutral salt (e.g., sodium chloride) and the known<br>
acid-binding agent (e.g., sodium hydroxide or sodium carbonate) in a high<br>
temperature of 90°C or above to fix the color.<br>
The dyeing or printing methods employed in the process of the<br>
present invention are not limited to the above methods.<br>
Other objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention will<br>
become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken<br>
in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

added therein to make up the total amount of the dye solution to be 75 parts<br>
in total. After that, 5 parts of 320g/l soda ash are added to the dyeing vessel.<br>
Four parts of woven cotton fabric are put into the dye solution, followed by<br>
covering and locking the dyeing vessel, and the dyeing vessel is shaken to<br>
survey the dye. Then, the dyeing vessel is put into a thermostatic bath,<br>
followed by switching on the rotating knob. The temperature is raised to 60<br>
°C in 30 minutes and then kept for 60 minutes. After dyeing is<br>
accomplished, the dyed fabric is taken out and washed with cold water.<br>
Finally, after washing, dehydration and drying, a red fabric with good build<br>
up and good tinctorial yield is obtained.<br>
Testing example 2<br>
Three parts of the dyestuff prepared in Example 1 are dissolved in<br>
100 mL of water to obtain a 30 parts/1 padding liquor. Twenty-five ml of<br>
alkali solvent (taking 15ml/l of NaOH and 30 parts/1 of Glauber's salt) is<br>
added to the padding liquor and stirred thoroughly. The resultant solution is<br>
then put into a pad roller machine. The cotton fabric is padded by the roller<br>
pad machine, and batched for 4 hours at room temperature. The obtained<br>
red fabric is sequentially washed with cold water, boiling water for 10<br>
minutes, boiling non-ionic detergent for 10 minutes, again with cold water<br>
and then dried to obtain a red fabric with good build up and good tinctorial<br>
yield.<br>
