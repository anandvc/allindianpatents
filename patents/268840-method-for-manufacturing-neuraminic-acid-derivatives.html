is included [yield of compound (VIa): 35%, overall yield from<br>
compound (VIa) to compound (IIIa): 1 to 33%, resulting in 0.4 to<br>
12%];<br>
(2) an expensive silyl protective group is used;<br>
(3) N-methylation of an acetamide group occurs as a side<br>
reaction of the methylation reaction of a hydroxy group<br>
[production procedure of compound (IVb)]; or<br>
(4) a hazardous azidation reaction at high temperature is<br>
included [production procedure of compound (IVg)].<br>

When the compounds of the present invention are exposed to<br>
the atmosphere or are blended with water or organic solvent,<br>
they may form hydrates or solvates. Such hydrates and solvates<br>
are also embraced in the compounds of the present invention.<br>
Compound (Ib) and compound (IIb) include an anhydride and<br>
hydrates. Preferably, the hydrate of compound (Ib) and hydrate<br>
of compound (IIb) are monohydrates.<br>
The compounds of the present invention have an asymmetric<br>
carbon atom within their molecule, and thus there exist<br>
stereoisomers (enantiomers and diastereomers are included).<br>
These stereoisomers and mixtures thereof in an arbitrary ratio<br>
(including racemic form) are embraced in the compounds of the<br>
present invention.<br>
It is known that when compound (I) is administered to a<br>
warm-blooded animal, the acyloxy group at the 3-position of the<br>
side chain is converted into a hydroxyl group by a metabolic<br>
reaction such as hydrolysis, and the generated compound (III)<br>
shows pharmacological activity (Patent Document 1 and the like).<br>
In addition, when compound (II) is administered to a warm-<br>
blooded animal, the acyloxy group at the 2-position of the side<br>
chain is converted into a hydroxyl group by a metabolic reaction<br>
such as hydrolysis, and compound (III) is generated in a similar<br>
manner. Since both compound (I) and compound (II) are converted<br>
into the same compound (III), which is an active metabolite,<br>
within an organism of a warm-blooded animal, it can be<br>
considered that both the compounds are active ingredients, from<br>
the point of view of using a mixture of compound (I) and<br>
compound (II) as a medicament. On the other hand, since a<br>
medicament is required to show a constant pharmacological effect<br>
and physical and chemical stability, it is preferable that the<br>
composition ratio of these compounds is constant, from the point<br>
of view of the quality of a mixture of compound (I) and compound<br>
(II) as a medicament.<br>
In the present invention, the chemical purity of the<br>
compound, the content of a compound as an impurity, or the<br>
composition ratio of a mixture of compound (I) and compound (II)<br>
may be determined by methods known in the field of organic<br>
chemistry (for example, high performance liquid chromatography,<br>
weight %, and the like), and is preferably determined by peak<br>
area ratios under high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(hereinafter also referred to as HPLC). The measurement<br>
conditions for HPLC shall be selected appropriately; however,<br>
they are preferably as shown hereinbelow.<br>

of compound (I), compound (II), and compound as impurity, which<br>
are detected from 0 minute to approximately 1.2 times the length<br>
of retention time of compound (I), are measured. By HPLC<br>

peak area ratio under HPLC measurement conditions (2). The<br>
content of compound (VIII) and compound (13) can be calculated<br>
as the peak area ratio under HPLC measurement conditions (1).<br>
The peak area ratios of compound (I) and compound (II) can<br>
be measured in accordance with the aforementioned HPLC<br>
measurement conditions (1). The composition ratio (%) of a<br>
mixture of compound (I) and compound (II) can be calculated from<br>
the following equation.<br>
Composition ratio of compound (I)<br>
= [peak area ratio of compound (I) / [peak area ratio of<br>
compound (I) + peak area ratio of compound (II)]] x 100<br>
Composition ratio of compound (II)<br>
= [peak area ratio of compound (II) / [peak area ratio of<br>
compound (I) + peak area ratio of compound (II)]] x 100<br>
The chemical purity of compound (I) or pharmacologically<br>
acceptable salt thereof is preferably 95% or more, more<br>
preferably 97% or more, even more preferably 98% or more,<br>
further preferably 99% or more, and most preferably 99.5% or<br>
more, by weight. Compound (I) may contain compound (II), and in<br>
the case where compound (I) contains compounds (II), the<br>
chemical purity is calculated by taking both compound (I) and<br>
compound (II) as active ingredients. It is more preferable that<br>
the content of compounds other than compound (I) [and compound<br>
(II)] or pharmacologically acceptable salt thereof is below the<br>
detection limit.<br>
Concerning compound (I) which may contain compound (II),<br>
the composition ratio of compound (I) and compound (II) is<br>
preferably 85:15 to 100:0, more preferably 90:10 to 100:0, even<br>
more preferably 92:8 to 100:0, and most preferably 95:5 to<br>
100:0, by weight. The content of a compound represented by<br>
formula (II) may be below the detection limit.<br>
Concerning compound (I) or pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt thereof, the content of compound (VII) is preferably 2% or<br>
less, more preferably 1% or less, even more preferably 0.5% or<br>
less, further preferably 0.3% or less, and most preferably 0.1%<br>
or less, by weight. It is more preferable that the content of<br>
compound (VII) is below the detection limit.<br>
Concerning compound (I) or pharmacologically acceptable<br>
salt thereof, the content of compound (VIII) is preferably 2% or<br>
less, more preferably 1% or less, even more preferably 0.5% or<br>
less, further preferably 0.3% or less, and most preferably 0.1%<br>
or less, by weight. It is more preferable that the content of<br>
compound (VIII) is below the detection limit.<br>

less, more preferably 1% or less, even more preferably 0.5% or<br>

or less, by weight. It is more preferable that the content of<br>
compound (13) is below the detection limit.<br>
The present invention shown by Process A is superior to<br>
publicly known manufacturing methods or synthetic intermediates,<br>
in points given below, for example.<br>
(i) Concerning the production procedures of compound (IVb)<br>
of Process W and compound (VIb) of Process Z, since an acetamide<br>
group exists in their starting materials compound (IVa) and<br>
compound (VIa), N-methylation occurs as a side reaction. For<br>
example, with respect to compound (VIa), the N-methylated<br>
compound is generated at approximately 12% (refer to data of N-<br>
methylated compound of compound (VIa) described in Comparative<br>
Example 1).<br>
In contrast, compound (7) has no functional group which<br>
may be methylated other than the hydroxyl group at the 1-<br>
position of the side chain, and thus N-methylation as a side<br>
reaction does not occur in the methylation reaction of compound<br>
(7). In addition, the oxazolidine ring of compound (7)<br>
simultaneously serves as a protective group to prevent N-<br>
methylation and as a partial structure which is to be converted<br>
into an acetamide group at the 5-position in Step A-6. Further,<br>
since compound (7) is a crystalline solid, it can easily be<br>
purified by recrystallization. Therefore, compound (7)<br>
contributes to the improvement of the overall yield in Process<br>
A, by achieving efficient methylation of the hydroxyl group at<br>
the 1-position of the side chain, and by achieving a reduction<br>
in the number of procedures in Process A.<br>
(ii) Concerning the production procedure of compound (IVg)<br>
in Process W, Process Y, and Process Z, since the reaction is<br>
carried out under a high temperature of 80°C or higher using<br>
approximately 6 moles of sodium azide, it is extremely hazardous<br>
especially from an industrial perspective, when the explosive<br>
nature of azide compounds is taken into consideration. In<br>
addition, the stereoselectivity of the reaction at the 4-<br>
position is not enough, and thus the generation ratio of<br>
compound (IVg) and the undesired stereoisomer in which the azide<br>
group has the opposite configuration of compound (IVg), is<br>
approximately 7:1 (refer to Comparative Example 2).<br>
In contrast, concerning the azidation reaction of compound<br>
(8), by using a Lewis acid, the amount of azidation agent used<br>
is reduced to approximately 1.5 to 2 equivalents, and the<br>
reaction proceeds under extremely mild conditions of 0°C to 30°C.<br>
In addition, the stereoselectivity of the reaction at the 4-<br>
position is improved, and thus the generation ratio of compound<br>
(9) and the undesired stereoisomer is improved to 15:1 (refer to<br>
data described in Step A-6 of Example 1).<br>
Accordingly, the manufacturing method of compound (9) from<br>
compound (8) improves the practicality of Process A from an<br>
industrial perspective, by achieving an improvement in the<br>
safety of the azidation reaction and stereoselective production<br>
of the desired isomer.<br>
(iii) Compound (IIIa) in Process Y and Process Z is a salt<br>
of trifluoroacetic acid which is corrosive, and is an amorphous<br>
solid, therefore being unable to be easily purified by<br>
recrystallization.<br>
In contrast, compound (13) is produced from compound (12),<br>
by a reaction with only water under mild conditions. In<br>
addition, since compound (13) is a crystalline solid, it can<br>
easily be purified by recrystallization. From an industrial<br>
perspective, it is extremely important to use a starting<br>
material with a purity as high as possible in the final<br>
procedure of the production, in order to obtain the desired<br>
compound with high purity. Therefore, compound (13) contributes<br>
to the production of compound (I) with high purity, by providing<br>
a starting material with high purity in the final procedure.<br>
(iv) Concerning the production procedure of compound (IVk)<br>
and compound (Ia) in Process W, (a) protection of a carboxyl<br>
group is necessary, (b) a 2,3-diacylated compound is generated<br>
as by-product, and (c) purification by silica gel column<br>
chromatography is required to remove the octanoic acid derived<br>
from the reagent. Here, as an acylation reaction of a hydroxyl<br>
group using an ortho ester, the following reaction is known<br>
(Carbohydrate Research, 1987, Vol. 167, pp. 77-86). Ra<br>
represents a C1-C4 alkyl group and the like. In the following<br>
reaction, the reactive functional group is a hydroxyl group<br>
only.<br><br>
In contrast, no similar acylation reaction that proceeds<br>
in the presence of a nitrogen functional group (guanidyl group),<br>
which is considered to be more reactive, is known. In the<br>
production procedure of compound (I) from compound (13), an<br>
acylation reaction proceeds with a fine yield in the presence of<br>
a guanidyl group. In the present procedure, (a') protection of<br>
a carboxyl group is unnecessary, (b') selective mono-acylation<br>
proceeds, resulting in scarce generation of a 2,3-diacylated<br>
compound as a by-product and (c') removal of by-product derived<br>
from the reagent by silica gel column chromatography is not<br>
required. Therefore, the manufacturing method of compound (I)<br>
from compound (13) contributes largely to the production of<br>
compound (I) with high purity.<br>
(v) An acylation reaction of a hydroxyl group using an<br>
imino ester is not known to present date. The production<br>
procedure of compound (I) from compound (13) can also be<br>
conducted by using an imino ester compound (15) and a compound<br>
represented by the formula R7-OH, in place of an ortho ester<br>
compound (14). The production of compound (14) by a<br>
conventional method is very low in yield [refer to (vii) given<br>
below]. By using compound (15) directly, the inefficient<br>
production procedure of compound (14) from compound (15) can be<br>
omitted.<br>
(vi) Concerning the production procedure of compound (IVk)<br>
and compound (Ia) in Process W, compound (VII), which is a 2,3-<br>
diacylated compound, is generated as a by-product. Accordingly,<br>
a reduction in the amount of compound (VII) contained is<br>
required to obtain compound (Ia) with high purity (refer to<br>
Comparative Example 3).<br>
In the production procedure of compound (I) from compound<br>
(13), selective monoacylation reaction can be achieved by using<br>
compound (14) or compound (15), and thus compound (I) in which<br>
the amount of compound (VII) contained is less to such an extent<br>
as to be practical, can be produced (refer to Step A-10 of<br>
Example 1).<br>
Therefore, the manufacturing method of compound (I) from<br>
compound (13) contributes largely to the production of compound<br>
(I) with high purity.<br>
(vii) In the production of compound (14), when a compound<br>
represented by the formula R7-OH is used as a reagent and as a<br>
solvent to react with compound (15), following a publicly known<br>
method (Journal of American Chemical Society, 1942, vol.64, pp.1825-1827) ,<br>
the yield of compound (14) is approximately 35% to 50% (refer to<br>

[Effect of the Invention]<br>
The novel method of manufacturing neuraminic acid<br>
derivatives via the novel synthetic intermediate according to<br>
the present invention is superior from an industrial<br>
perspective, compared with publicly known manufacturing<br>
methodes. In addition, neuraminic acid derivatives with high<br>
purity can be obtained in high yield by the present<br>
manufacturing method.<br>
[Detailed Description of the preferred Embodiments]<br>
In the present invention, the method of manufacturing<br>
neuraminic acid derivatives can be conducted in accordance with<br>
the following Process A through Process G.<br>
In Process A through Process G, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7,<br>
and X have the same meanings as described above.<br>
The solvent used in the reactions of each of the steps of<br>
Process A through Process G is not limited so long as it does<br>
not inhibit the reaction and dissolves the starting material to<br>
some degree, and can be, for example, selected from the<br>
following solvent group. The solvent group comprises aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbons such as hexane, pentane, petroleum ether and<br>
cyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene and<br>
xylene; halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene chloride,<br>
chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, chlorobenzene<br>
and dichlorobenzene; ethers such as diethyl ether, diisopropyl<br>
ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, dimethoxyethane and<br>
diethyleneglycol dimethyl ether; ketones such as acetone, methyl<br>
ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; esters<br>
such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate and butyl acetate;<br>
nitriles such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, butyronitrile and<br>
isobutyronitrile; carboxylic acids such, as acetic acid and<br>
propionic acid; alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol,<br>

mixtures thereof.<br>
In the reactions of each of the steps of Process A through<br>
Process G, the reaction temperature differs depending on<br>
solvent, starting material, reagent and the like, and is<br>
selected appropriately. In addition, the reaction time differs<br>
depending on solvent, starting material, reagent and the like,<br>
and is selected appropriately.<br>
In the reactions of each of the steps of Process A through<br>
Process G, the desired compound of each of the steps can be<br>
isolated from a reaction mixture in accordance with ordinary<br>
methods after completion of the reaction. The desired compound<br>
may be obtained by, for example, (i) removing insoluble matters<br>
such as catalyst as necessary, (ii) extracting the desired<br>
compound by adding water and solvent which is immiscible with<br>
water (for example, ethyl acetate and the like) to the reaction<br>
mixture, (iii) washing the organic layer with water and drying<br>
it as necessary by using a drying agent such as anhydrous<br>
magnesium sulfate, and (iv) distilling off the solvent. The<br>
obtained desired compound can be further purified as necessary,<br>
by ordinary methods (for example, recrystallization,<br>
reprecipitation, or silicagel column chromatography). In<br>
addition, the desired compound of each procedure can also be<br>
used in the subsequent reaction without purification.<br>
