Field of the invention:<br>
This invention relates to process for preparation of novel stable extended release pharmaceutical compositions comprising Diltiazem salt such as Diltiazem HCI.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Diltiazem HCI, an anti-anginal agent blocks the influx of calcium ions in smooth and<br>
cardiac muscle, thus exhibiting potential cardiovascular activity. It also has negative<br>
chronotropic effect and negative ionotropic effect on heart muscles.<br>
Diltiazem HCI, being an acidic salt of basic drug is more soluble in acidic media and is<br>
freely soluble in water. The half-life of Diltiazem HCI is of the order of about 4 hours and<br>
is therefore recommended to be taken 3-4 times a day for effective therapy. Various<br>
attempts have been made to provide Diltiazem HCI in extended release composition to<br>
reduce the frequency of administration making it suitable for once daily administration.<br>
Extended release compositions comprising Diltiazem HCI that are intended to be<br>
administered for once a day dosing should ideally exhibit an in-vitro drug release profile<br>
of<br>
N.M.T 20% of Diltiazem HCI after 2 hours;<br>
N.M.T 50% of Diltiazem HCI after 4 hours;<br>
N.M.T 85% of Diltiazem HCI after 8 hours;<br>
and N.L.T. 70% of Diltiazem HCI after 16 hours<br>
Where "NMT" and "NLT" stands for "Not More Than" and "Not Less Than" respectively.<br>
U.S. Patents 5529791, 5288505, Canadian Patent application CA 2307547 and CA<br>
2292247 discloses an extended release galenical bead compositions wherein Diltiazem<br>
HCI is mixed with wetting agents that are essential to maintain the solubility of Diltiazem<br>
HCI and being unaffected by the pH and other adverse conditions in Gl tract. The<br>
beads are coated with a microporous membrane comprising atleast a water-soluble or<br>
water dispersible polymer or copolymer and a water, acid and base insoluble polymer<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant.<br>
U.S. Patent 4960596 and Canadian Patent CA 1331740 describe a slow release acid<br>
free galenical microgranules preparation comprising an inert central core. These inert<br>
cores were wetted  with  polyvinylpyrrolidone  solution  and  active  substance was<br>
deposited until the granules were dried. The operation was repeated several times till<br>
the quantity of active substance has been used up. Thereafter the microgranules were<br>
coated with an outer membrane comprising a mixture of shellac, ethylcellulose and talc<br>
or aqueous suspension of ethylcellulose and dibutylsebacate. However, it is essential<br><br>
Further and other objects will be clear from the summary of the invention and detailed description of the invention thereof.<br>

The present invention relates to process for the preparation of novel stable extended release pharmaceutical compositions comprising Diltiazem salt such as Diltiazem HCI suitable for once a day dosing.<br>
Extended release pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is prepared in the form of extended release pellets comprising Diltiazem HCI. Extended release pellet comprises of drug core that contains drug layer deposited on inert core that are further coated with a polymer membrane.<br>
In contrast to the preparation disclosed in the prior art that comprises mixture of pellets to achieve the desired release profile for once a day dosing, the present invention discloses preparation of Diltiazem HCI containing pellets of single release profile and yet achieves the desired drug release profile that are suitable for once a day dosing. The extended release pharmaceutical compositions containing Diltiazem HCI comprises drug layer that is exempt of wetting agent and yet achieves the desired pH independent in - vitro drug release profile. This is in contrast to the compositions disclosed in U.S. Patents 5529791, US 5288505, Canadian Patent application CA 2307547 and CA 2292247 where use of wetting agent is essential for maintaining the solubility of Diltiazem HCI that is unaffected by the pH and other adverse conditions in Gl tract.<br>
Further, the extended release pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is also exempt of shellac thereby avoiding unnecessary precaution and needless additional drying and processing time thus making the product economical. Extended release pharmaceutical composition comprising Diltiazem HCI exhibits pH independent in-vitro drug release profile when analyzed in USP type II apparatus using 900ml of distilled water / 0.1N HCI / pH 4.5 acetate buffer / pH 6.8 phosphate buffer at 100 rpm.<br>

The pellets prepared as per example 1 of the present invention is analyzed in-vitro in<br>
USP Type II apparatus using 900ml of distilled water / pH 6.8 phosphate buffer / 0.1N<br>
HCI / pH 4.5 acetate buffer at 100 rpm. The drug release profile of these pellets is<br>
different media is depicted in the figure I.<br>
It is evident from the figure I that cumulative mean % drug release from the extended<br>
release pellets comprising Diltiazem HCI is substantially same irrespective of the pH of<br>
the media in which it is analyzed. In other words Diltiazem HCI extended release pellets<br>
exhibits pH independent in - vitro drug release profile with a maximum variation of less<br>
than 20% and preferably less than 15%.<br>
If the extended release pellets comprising Diltiazem HCI releases drug too fast to<br>
comply the desired in-vitro dissolution profile, it may receive an additional coat to<br>
achieve the desired in-vitro dissolution profile. Extended release pellets comprising<br>
Diltiazem HCI complying with the desired dissolution profile is filled in capsule to deliver<br>
the therapeutic dose of Diltiazem HCI.<br>
Extended release pellets comprising Diltiazem HCI are filled into sized capsule to<br>
deliver the therapeutic dose of about 90mg, 120mg, 180mg, 240mg, 300mg, 360mg<br>
and 420mg.<br>
The extended release pellets filled in capsule are stable atleast for a period of 6months<br>
at 40 degree centigrade and 75% relative humidity indicating that the formulation can<br>
be assigned a shelf life of 24 months at room temperature.<br>
