				<td>A DEVICE FOR PROCESSING THE FINISH OF WORK PIECES<br>
Specification:<br>
The invention relates to a device for the purpose of processing the finish of work pieces,<br>
which exhibits a feed unit with a slide and a drive that is NC-controlled, a motorized<br>
spindle unit with a motor-driven tool Soindle, as well as a device for measuring force for<br>
the purpose of measuring the force of contact pressure that is brought to bear upon the tool<br>
spindle in conjunction with the process ing of a work piece.<br>
It is known how to measure the force of the contact pressure that is brought to bear upon<br>
the tool spindle continually in the course of processing a work piece and to regulate,<br>
subsequently, the contact pressure of the processing tool on the surface of the work piece,<br>
by degrees, to a pre-determined limit a which an optimal removal of material occurs (DE<br>
39 30 457 A1). Furthermore, in DE 197 38 818 A1, a process is described in which,<br>
depending upon deviations in the measurements and form of the geometry of the work<br>
piece, which are determined during the processing of the work piece, the contact pressure<br>
or rather, the feed, of the work piece to be processed is controlled. The tool support is<br>
equipped with a measuring device that exhibits a precision indicator and supporting<br>
elements.<br><br>
In processing the finish of work pieces that have small parts, for example, processing the<br>
finish on seating surfaces of fuel injector valves, on flat surfaces of miniature pressure<br>
sensors, or the like, precision-guided feeding motions of the rotating grinding tool are<br>
necessary in order to meet the high standards for retaining the dimensions and the surface<br>
quality of the processed work piece. The feed must be set in such a manner that the<br>
processing tool lies against the surface of the work piece that is to be processed with a defined<br>
force that can be adjusted in a finely sensitive manner. As a rule, contact forces of less than<br>
100 N must be set and, in the case of very small work pieces, contact forces on an order of<br>
magnitude of 1 to 25 N must be set.<br>
It is the underlying task of the invention to indicate a device for processing the finish of work<br>
pieces that renders power-controlled feeding motions possible, with a contact pressure that<br>
can be adjusted with sensitivity and maintained with precision.<br>
The task is performed according to the invention in the case of a device having the structure<br>
described at the outset by virtue of the fact that the motorized spindle unit, with resilient<br>
elements that accept the weight of the motorized spindle unit and can be moved only in the<br>
direction of processing, is seated on the slide, and that the device that measures the force is<br>
arranged between connective elements on the motorized spindle unit and on the slide.<br>
The motorized spindle unit is preferably supported on leaf springs, which are oriented<br>
perpendicular to the direction of the slide's advance. The leaf springs, which are oriented<br>
vertically, mounted with a short exposed length, are very yielding and flexible in the direction<br>
of the spindle's advance, so that contact forces at the tool spindle are transferred to the device<br>
that measures the force in a manner that is sensitive and involves little loss. When mounted<br><br>
with a short exposed length, in particular, the leaf springs can accept great vertical forces as<br>
well as great transverse forces. Therefore, they lend themselves to supporting the motorized<br>
spindle unit on the slide, such that additional guides, which are subject to friction, are not<br>
necessary.<br>
The device for measuring the force is arranged between the resilient elements, for example,<br>
on the underside of the motorized spindle unit between the leaf springs or, in the direction of<br>
the work, it can be connected to the end of the motorized spindle unit that faces the rear.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the unit that measures the force exhibits a piezo<br>
element as a force sensor. The piezo element renders very precise measurements of force<br>
possible, with extremely low degrees of deformation. The use of other force sensors should<br>
not be precluded. Within the context 0f'the teaching according to the invention, expansion<br>
measurement strips or magneto restrictive sensors can be used as well.<br>
The force sensor, a piezo element for example is, according to a preferred embodiment form<br>
of the invention, arranged between two contact elements that exhibit spherical contact<br>
surfaces. The spherical contact surfaces are supported on annular or dish-shaped bearing<br>
surfaces of the connective elements, which are provided on the motorized spindle unit and the<br>
slide. In the case of this embodiment, it is assured that the force sensor is mounted in a<br>
manner that is devoid of transverse forces, and the contact forces that are brought to bear upon<br>
the tool spindle are transferred to the force sensor in a manner that exhibits little loss. In the<br>
process, pre-stressing the force sensor is to good effect. An advantageous embodiment of the<br>
force-measuring device makes provision for the embodiment of the contact elements in the<br>
form of bolts, such that one bolt exhib its a threaded borehole and the other bolt exhibits a<br>
longitudinal borehole, and the bolts are braced against the force sensor with a defined force of<br><br>
pre-tension by means of an expansion screw. Furthermore the connective element for the<br>
force measurement device, which is arranged on the slide is, to good purpose, arranged on a<br>
carrier, which is attached in guidance grooves of the slide in such a manner that it can be<br>
moved for adjustments.<br>
The device according to the invention renders a very precise and sensitive detection of those<br>
contact forces that are brought to bear on the working spindle in processing the finish of work<br>
pieces possible. The measurement values of the force are led to the NC control of the feed<br>
drive. With a high-resolution NC feediig of the slide, which is performed in a manner<br>
according to the state of the art, minima1 forces, forces defined within the range between 0.1<br>
N and 10N, for example, can be brought to bear upon the work piece. In processing the<br>
finish of serially produced parts having small pieces, a surface of high quality is achieved in<br>
the process. In conjunction with a pathway measurement system that can be integrated into<br>
the device, it is possible, furthermore, to detect, by means of measurement technology,<br>
progress along the feed pathway over time. From, the measurement values of the force<br>
measurement device and/or the pathway measurement system, it is possible to derive control<br>
commands for the purpose of guiding the process in conjunction with the processing of the<br>
work piece.<br>
In what follows, the invention will be elucidated in greater detail by virtue of a drawing that<br>
represents just one embodiment example.<br>
Fig. 1	shows, schematically, a device for processing the finish of work pieces,<br><br>
Fig. 2	shows, schematically, an additional structural configuration of the device, in<br>
cutout fashion, and in a markedly enlarged representation, compared to Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3	shows, schematically, a view from above onto the object represented in Fig. 2.<br>
A feed unit 1, having a slide 2 and an NC-controlled drive 3, a motorized spindle unit 4 with a<br>
motor-driven tool spindle 5, as well as a device that measures force 6, for the purpose of<br>
measuring the contact pressure that is brought to bear upon the tool spindle 5 in conjunction<br>
with processing a work piece, are part and parcel of the fundamental structure of the device<br>
depicted in Fig. 1. The motorized spindle unit 4 is seated on the slide 2 by means of leaf<br>
springs 7, such that the leaf springs 7 are oriented perpendicular to the direction of advance of<br>
slide 2 and accept the weight of the motorized spindle unit 4. The force-measuring device 6 is<br>
arranged between connective elements 8, 9, on the motorized spindle unit 4 and on slide 2,<br>
and it is equipped with a piezo element as a force sensor 10. Slide 2 exhibits a precision slide<br>
guide 11 that is embodied in accordance with the state of the art, as well as a roller spindle 12<br>
as the propulsion aggregate. Other embodiments of the feed unit 1, for example a linear drive,<br>
are not precluded.<br>
The mounting of the leaf springs 7, as well as the embodiment of the force measurement<br>
device 6, is depicted in greater detail in Figs. 2 and 3. The force sensor 10 is arranged<br>
between two contact elements, which are embodied as bolts 13, 13' in the embodiment<br>
example, and exhibit contact surfaces 14. The contact surfaces 14 are supported at annular or<br>
dish-shaped bearing surfaces of the of the sic] connective elements 8, 9. One of the bolts 13,<br>
exhibits a threaded borehole, the other bolt 13', a longitudinal borehole. The bolts, 13, 13',<br>
are pre-stressed, with a defined force of pre-tension, against the force sensor 10, which is<br><br>
arranged between the bolts 13, 13', by means of an expansion screw, 15. A pre-tension force<br>
between 100 and 200 N is to good purpose. From Figs. 2 and 3 one can derive, furthermore,<br>
that the connective element 9 on the same side as the slide is arranged on a carrier 16 for the<br>
force-measuring device 6, which is attached by means of tenon blocks 17 in guide grooves 18<br>
of slide 2 so as to be capable of movement for the purpose of effecting adjustments.<br>
In the embodiment example shown in Figs. 2 and 3, the force measurement device 6 is<br>
connected to the rear end of motorized spindle 4, in the direction of the work. The two leaf<br>
springs 7, of which only the rearward leaf spring is depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, are attached with<br>
a short mounting length to carrier plates 19 and 20. which are attached to slide 2, or to the<br>
underside of the motorized spindle units. Securing pins 21 prevent inadmissibly great<br>
movements of the motorized spindle unit 4 when tool changes, for example, or other<br>
mounting work is done.<br>
The force measurement device 6, which is depicted, in Figs. 2 and 3, can also be arranged on<br>
the underside of the motorized spindle unit 4, between the leaf springs 7, as is schematically<br>
represented in Fig. 1.<br>
The device according to the invention can, in addition, be equipped with a device for<br>
measuring the length of the pathway 22, by means of which the course of the feed pathway<br>
over time can be determined by means of measurement technology. Control commands to<br>
direct the process in the processing of work pieces can be derived from the force measurement<br>
values and from the measurement values of the pathway measurement system. That will be<br>
explained in what follows by virtue of the examples. When the work piece is cut into, that is,<br>
when the tool makes contact with the work piece, the force-controlled feed rate of advance<br><br>
declines rapidly, such that the course of the curve, over time, flattens as the removal of<br>
material from the surface of the work piece increases. It is possible to derive criteria for the<br>
optimal management of a finish-processing process from the course of the feed pathway over<br>
time. Thus, the profile of the feed pathway over time can be used as a measure of the quality<br>
of the surface of the work piece. In the case of a prescribed contact pressure between the<br>
work piece and the processing tool, the force-controlled rate of feed reaches a rate that is<br>
approximately constant with increasing surface quality. By setting a value of ideal force<br>
within the described range of settings, between 0.1 and 100 N, it is possible to change the<br>
amount of material removed and the resultant rate of feed. In the case of an optimal force<br>
relative to the process, a higher surface quality is generally reached very constantly. The<br>
parameter adjustments can be optimized in such a manner that the desired surface quality is<br>
achieved with minimal processing time.<br>
From the course of the feed pathway ova: time, furthermore, it is possible to derive a signal<br>
value that characterizes the cutting behavior in order to add to a tool, to identify any breakage<br>
of a tool that might occur, or to identify tool wear. Furthermore, from the course of the feed<br>
pathway over time, it is possible to asce lain instabilities in the process.<br><br>
