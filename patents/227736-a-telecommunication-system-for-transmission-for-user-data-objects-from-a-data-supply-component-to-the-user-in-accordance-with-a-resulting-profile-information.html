				<td>A telecommunication System for transmission of user data objects from a data supply component to the user in accordance with a resulting profile information<br>
The present invention relates to a telecommunication System for transmission of user data objects from a data supply component to the user in accordance with a resulting profile information in a telecommunication network.<br>
A system for transmission or downloading of user data objects from a data supply component onto a telecommunication device, especially designed as a mobile radio device, is currently being discussed. The starting point for such discussions is that the telecommunication device is located in a telecommunication network designed as a mobile radio network, in which data generally and user data objects in particular are transmitted by means of a protocol specified by the WAP Forum (WAP: Wireless Application Protocol). It is further assumed that the data supply component of a data or content supplier is located in a further telecommunication network which is especially embodied as an Internet Protocol-based network. To establish a data connection between the data supply component and the telecommunication device (at least) two different sub-interfaces are thus needed, namely an air interface on the one hand and a cable-based interface. There is provision for WAP protocols to be used, as already mentioned, for bridging the air interface. By contrast, in the telecommunication network of the data supply component (HTTP (HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is used. Thus,<br><br>
Since different protocols are used on the interface and the network side, there is oricusuiib for a connaection component to beused, in this instance what is known as a WAP gateway, which adapts the user data to the various lower layers (air interface e.g. WSP (Wireless Session Protocol) as a WAP; network side: HTTP). This type of WAP gateway is generally also capable of converting data types or formats (e.g. translating the file format "gif" into "jpeg", for files of type image or still image).<br>
Telecommunication devices such as mobile radio devices or mobile phones generally differ from each other in their characteristic features or capabilities. Thus for example the characteristics of the display devices differ greatly in some cases (e.g. in size and resolution) and thereby also their capabilities to be able to display or process specific file types or file formats. So that a data supply component or a data supply server in a network can obtain knowledge about the characteristics or capabilities of a WAP-capable telecommunication device of a user, the WAP Forum has standardized what is known as the UA-Prof (UA-Prof: User Agent Profile) [7], with the aid of which the characteristics of a WAP-capable telecommunication device can be made known on the network side (i.e. in the network of the data supply component). The method also takes into account the capabilities of a WAP gateway which handles the data transferred between telecommunication device and data supply component and can also modify said data. On the network side the provision of suitable data by a server also means that the characteristics of the WAP gateway are relevant.<br>
A description is given below, with reference to Figure ,I for a general case of how a data supply component D receives the current UA-Prof of a WAP-capable telecommunication device T. Initially, on<br><br>
Registration of the WAP- capable telecommunication device T or the setting up of a WSp connection, What is known a s a basic profile BP<br>
or  basic profile  information  is   transferred  to   the  WAP  gateway  G.   If the characteristics or   capabilities  of   the  telecommunication  device T have been changed or  expanded by an  additionally-connected  line component,  such as  an  additional  hardware   component   (e.g.   color display),  an additional  difference  profile   DPI   or   first  difference profile information  is   sent  with  the  basic  profile   as   a   first   sub-profile information object  to  the  WAP  gateway  G,   as   is  depicted  by step  1   ("1" in the  circle).   Both profiles,   namely  BP  and  DPI,   can   if necessary be buffered and evaluated by WAP  gateway  G,   cf.   step  2. WAP gateway G can now  for  its part  supplement  the   received profiles BP and DPI by a  separate  difference profile   DP2   or   second  difference profile information.   This   is  advantageous   when  the  WAP  gateway  G  has particular characteristics  or  capabilities   which  differ   from  those of the BP and DPI profiles  sent beforehand by  the  WAP-capable telecommunication device  T or which  supplement these  profiles.   All (three)  profiles  are  then  transmitted  in   step   3   as   a   second  sub-profile information object  to  the  data   supply  component   D.   The  data supply component  D creates  on  the  basis   of  all   transferred  profiles (BP,   DPI and DP2)   a  resulting overall  profile  or  overall  profile object RP for the WAP-capable  telecommunication  device  T,   as   should be indicated by step 4.   The resulting profile  RP,   containing  the individual characteristics of the WAP-capable  telecommunication device T and the supplementary capabilities  of  the  WAP  gateway  G  and possibly of other network units,   is  the   current  UA-Prof and will be administered by the data supply component  D.<br>
During a WSP session the downloading  of   any data,   especially  user data objects,  can be  initiated by a WAP-capable   telecommunication<br><br>
Device T by sending a data request message. Should the characteristics ore capabilities of the WAp-capable telecommunication<br>
device have changed in the interim (i,e. after a WSP connection was first established) , for example through connection of another additional hardware component, in or together with a data request message issued, a current adapted difference profile DPS or a third difference profile information are transmitted in a first sub-profile information object to the WAP gateway G in step 5 and if necessary evaluated there according to step 6. The remaining transmission of the basic profile BP and the difference profiles DP3 and DP2 in a second sub-profile information object between WAP gateway G and data supply component D in accordance with step 7 and the creation of the resulting profile in accordance with step 8 are undertaken in a similar way to the method described above. If the characteristics or capabilities of the WAP-capable telecommunication device have not changed after the first setup of the WSP connection, for a data request message issued, the method refers back to the profile previously transferred and buffered in WAP gateway G (cf. step 2) or at the data supply component (cf. step 4).<br>
The principle for generating the resulting profile is very elegant, the resulting profile or overall profile namely being generated from the basic profile and any number of difference profiles.<br>
The basic assumption is further made for the use and definition of the UA-Prof that a WAP gateway recognizes and suitably handles the data types transmitted to the WAP-capable telecommunication device, i.e. changes or converts them if necessary on the path from the data supply component to the telecommunication device. A typical example of this is the conversion of an image.<br><br>
Assuming that the telecommunication device can only display images or the Jpeg or format and that the data supply component transmits a "gif'-type image,   the  WAP  gateway  can  convert   the   image in accordance with its capabilities   from  type   "gif"   to  type   or format "jpeg" and pass the converted image  on   to   the telecommunication device on which  it  can   then  be  processed  or displayed.<br>
This method is accordingly supported by UA-Profs,   in  that   the WAP-capable telecomnunication device  initially  specifies   in  its  basic profile BP the ability to process  or  display  images  of  type   "jpeg". The WAP gateway detects this specification,   knows  that  it   is  capable itself of converting images of type   "gif"   into   type   "jpeg"   and therefore specifies in difference profile   DP2  that   images   of  type "gif"  will also be supported.  On the data   supply  component   side  the resulting overall profile RP is generated.   The  data  supply component can however now no longer distinguish between  the  original capabilities of the telecommunication  device  and  the   additional capabilities of the overall system of WAP-capable   telecommunication device  and BAP gateway.  In this  example   the   server-side   transmission (i.e.   transmission on the data supply component   side)   of an  image  of type   "gif" is now possible,  with the  gateway  undertaking  the corresponding conversion.<br>
Problems can however arise when the  file   types   requiring  conversion by the WAP gateway are enclosed   (packed)   into  another  data   format which cannot be suitably handled by the WAP gateway.   There   are two main examples which illustrate this  situation:<br>
1. Digital Bights Management (DRM) : The solution currently specified in the WAP Form for managing rights of protected digital objects is based on the fact that the object is transported in a container file<br><br>
or in a container, which, for unencrypted objects is of type "application/vnd.wap.drm.message" and for encrypted objects is of type "application/vnd. wap . drm. content" . With unencrypted objects there is theoretically the option for a WAP gateway to access the enclosed object and to change it, but there is no explicit provision for this to be done. With encrypted objects the WAP gateway has no possibility of accessing the object since it does not have the key and the data therefore only appears as a binary packet. Even when the enclosed object is an image of the type known to the WAP gateway which could accordingly be converted into another type, this is not possible in the case described. The enclosed object would be passed on unchanged by the WAP gateway to the telecommunication device on which it would not be able to be displayed.<br>
2. Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS) : In the MMS the message is transmitted in the form of a Multimedia Message (MM) from a so-called MMS-Relay/Server (which serves as an MMS switching unit in a network) to an MMS Client, a specific application on the WAP-capable telecommunication device. In the solution specified by the WAP Forum the MM is a message with binary codes for presentation of the header fields which are not known to the WAP gateway. The messages are of type "application/vnd.wap.mms-message" and contain the objects to be transferred. The WAP gateway in its turn has the opportunity of extracting the objects from the message and adapting them to the features of the receiving telecommunication device. If an object of a specific type, requiring conversion by the WAP gateway, is integrated into the MMS message by the MMS Relay Server, the WAP gateway cannot however perform its task, meaning that the object arrives at the telecommunication device unchanged and cannot be used there.<br><br>
Furthermore the that formation of an overall profile a s has been described above, makes it no longer possible to distinguish been described above, makes it no ionyer possible -to d.i.s tiuguj.sh between how the integral components of the characteristics of the telecommunication device (possibly with additional hardware components) and the additional characteristics of the system made up of telecommunication device and WAP gateway can also have a negative effect, if for example an object can be offered in different formats by the data supply component, of which some require a conversion by ; the WAP gateway to enable them to be processed by the telecommunication device, and others can be forwarded unchanged from the WAP gateway to the telecommunication device. Here the server-side (i.e. from the data supply component) selection of a format which requires no conversion by the WAP gateway is advantageous since a conversion can lower the quality of the object, additional time is needed for downloading the object for conversion, computing power is required in the WAP gateway and the user can incur additional costs, depending on the billing model.<br>
The object of the present invention is now to improve a method such as has been described with reference to Figure 1 for example such that a more efficient transmission of user data objects, particularly of encrypted or packed user data objects, is made possible.<br>
This object is achieved by the features of the independent claims. Advantageous embodiments are the object of the subclaims .<br>
For a method for the transmission of user data objects a data supply component to supply user data objects is provided which transmits information objects over one or at least one connection component to a telecommunication device of a user in accordance with an overall profile information object. The overall profile information object<br><br>
specifies in this case which type of a user data object can be transmitted to the telecommunication device so that it can process the object, ln addition a first item of profile   information  is inserted into the overall profile information   object  which  specifies which type of user data object can be  directly processed by  the telecommunicaticB dwice. Furthermore  a  second item of profile information can be inserted which specifies  which  type  of user  data object can be converted by the connection  component  into  a  type  of user data object rfiidj can be processed by  a  telecommunication device,  this profile information,  especially  the   first  profile information, ttas allae the data supply  component  where  possible   to select the types of user data object  for  a  transmission to  the telecommunicatM devke which can be  directly processed by  the telecomm«nicati« device and do not require  any manipulation or conversion on the put of the connection  component  to  enable  them to be processed bf tie telemaannication device .<br>
Consequently, ia accoriance with an advantageous   embodiment,   user data objects of a type in accordance with the   first profile information are transited fron the data  supply  component  to  the telecommunicatMB device initially with high priority.   This means that  a  check is »dc as to whether the  data   supply  component   is supplying user drta objects able to be processed directly by  the telecommuBicatMBdwke. If the check  is   successful   these   types  of user data objects are finally transmitted to  the  telecommunication device.   Referraf t» tte exaaple given  above,   in  which  the telecommimicatioi dntke is able to process   image  data of type "jpeg",   the cnaecticB cnponent is able   to  convert  image  data  of type  "gift iRtotjpe "jpeg and finally the  data   supply  component provides i«age dtta of type *jpeg" and  "gif",   the  data  supply component, since it recognizes from the   first   item of profile<br><br>
Information tha the telecommunication device can process data of a type “jpeg” immediately transmits this type of image data of type   "jpeg"   to the telecommunication  device  as  user data  objects.   On  the one  hand this requires  no  conversion  of  image   data  by  the  connection component   (possible  conversion  costs   can  be   saved  and  the transmission time also reduced without conversion)   and packing or encryption of user  data  objects   is   possible   since   the   data   supply component only transmits  to  the  telecommunication device  user  data objects   for which  it  knows,   on  the  basis   of  the   first  profile information,   that  the  device  can  process   the  user  data  object.<br>
If the  check as  to whether   the  data  supply  component   is   supplying user data objects which can be processed directly by the telecommunication device  produces   a  negative  result,   then  in accordance with a  further  embodiment  of the  invention  user  data objects of a type in accordance with the  second profile  information are transmitted at a  lower priority than before   from the  data  supply component to the telecommunication device.<br>
In accordance with a  further advantageous  embodiment  the telecommunication device   transmits,   before   the   transmission  of user data  objects  from the  data   supply  component   to  telecommunication device,   a  first  sub profile   information  object  with  the   first  prove our information to the  connection  component,   which   for  its  part supplements the  first   sub  prefer  our  information  object  by  the second profile information  to  form a  second  sub profile   information object and transfers  this  to  the  data  supply  component.   There,   on the basis qf_the  second sub-profile   information  object  or  all profile  information transferred,   an  overall   resulting  profile information object can be  created.<br>
It is   further conceivable   for  the  telecommunication device  to be expanded by an additional   service  component  which  enables   it  to<br><br>
Extend the scope of the user data objects able to be processed by  the telecommunicatiomn device this type of ser vice component can for<br>
example te an additional hardware component,   such as   a   specific color display device with high resolution  for  displaying  high-resolutioB Mid color iiiages or graphics   and also  an  additional software cnponent or software application,   for  example   for processing ami playing music data in  the  MP3   format.   This   type  of service opponent can then be in a position  to process   types   of user data  objects which the telecommunication  device   can  already  process, but  it cm also be a position to process   further  types  of  user data object which tie telecoanunication  device  itself  cannot  process.   As a conseqaace the first sub-profile  information  object  can  then be supplemental by a third item of profile  information which  specifies the types of user data object by which the  scope  of  the   user  data objects of the teleco»wnication device   is  expanded  by  the a dd i t i oral service component.<br>
To miniaia the volumes of data to be  transferred between  the telecoiMMBcation device and the connection  component   (especially  if an air interface between them is provided)   and/or between  the connectionCD^Jonent and the data supply component,   it  is   also conceivable, in accordance with an advantageous  embodiment,   to provide tie profile information in the   first  and/or  the   second  sub-profile ufonation object in the  form of  a  reference,   which  points to profile information in each case which  is   stored on  the  data supply cofeMBt or OB a further data   supply   component   connected  to it.   This Haas that just addresses,   for  example   a  URL   (URL:   Uniform Resource loator) can be provided in  a  sub-profile   information object whick reference a storage location  in   the  data   supply component or other data supply components,   for  example  of  the<br><br>
Manufacturere sof the the telecommunication device of the additional sevicde component data the supply component only ha s to the <br>
address when creating the  overall  profile  object   in  order  to  obtain the   corresponding profile  information and  insert   it   into  the   overall profile object.<br>
In  accordance with a  further  advantageous   embodiment   the telecommunication device  is  located  in  the   first  telecommunication network and the data supply  component  and/or   the   further  data  supply component in a second telecommunication  network,   with  the   first  and the  second telecommunication network being connected  to  each  other. The  connection component can then be  arranged  in the   first  or  the second telecommunication network or especially  serve  to   interconnect the  two  telecommunication networks.   In  the  case   of  a  number  of connection components the connection  components   can  then  finally be arranged in the locations  just specified   (e.g.   as  will  be  explained later,   a communication  component  can   serve  as   a  WAP  gateway   for connecting the two telecommunication  networks  while   one   or more other communication components can be provided  for example  as conversion units of data  or user  data  objects   in  one   of   the specified telecommunication networks) .   In   this   case   it   is  possible for  the   first telecommunication  network  to  be   embodied  as   a mobile radio  network,  which is  operated  in  accordance  with   the   GSM   (Global System  for Mobile Communications)   or  the  UMTS   (Universal   Mobile Telecommunications system)   Standard.   For  this   type   of  embodiment  of a   first  telecommunication network  the  user  data   objects   can  be transmitted to the telecommunication  device by means   of  WAP protocols,   especially the Wireless   Session  Protocol.   In  this   context the  connection component  can be  embodied  to  connect   the   first  and the second telecommunication network as  a WAP gateway.   It   is   further conceivable for the second telecommunication network  to  be  embodied as  a network based on an Internet protocol,   in which  the  data  is transferred especially by means  of  the  Hypertext  Transfer   Protocol.<br><br>
In accordance with an advantageous embodiment the telecommunication device includes a radio module and is in particular embodies as a mobile telephone, a cordless telephone, a portable computer or a smartphone (a combination of mobile telephone and small portable computer).<br>
In accordance with a further advantageous embodiment the user data objects can contain text information, audio information, video information, executable programs, software modules, or a combination of these types of data.<br>
According to the present invention, a telecommunication System for transmission of user data objects from a data supply component to the user in accordance with a resulting profile information comprises a telecommunication network having a telecommunication device, a data supply component located in the said telecommunication network, for supplying user data objects to be transmitted, a connection component (C) provided for transmitting user data objects from the data supply component in accordance with overall profile information objects a uniform resource locator provided with reference to a storage location in the data supply component and a second telecommunication network or user device T connected to the said connector wherein the said connection component is set up so as to detect on the basis of first profile data to be processed by the terminal in accordance with the profile information and forwarding user data objects to the terminal without processing them.<br>
According to the present invention, telecommunications arrangement comprising a terminal (T) of a user, a data supply component (0) for supplying user data objects which is set up for transmission of user data objects in accordance with an overall information profile object (RP*) which specifies which type of user 30 data object can be transmitted to the terminal for processing, and a connection component (G) for transmitting user data objects from the data supply component to the terminal, characterized in that in the resulting profile information a first item of profile information (BP*, OP1 *, OP3*) is further inserted which specifies which type of user data objects can be processed by the terminal, and the connection component is set up so as to detect, on the basis of the first profile, that for user data objects which are able to be<br><br>
processed by the terminal in accordance with the first profile information, no processing of the<br>
user data objects is required, an accordingly to forward the user data objects to the terminal (T) without processing them.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be explained in more detail below with reference to the enclosed drawings. The Figures show :<br>

Possible embodiments for transmission of user data objects from a data supply component to a telecommunication device, especially a<br><br>
Mobile telephone of the user (simply refereed to as a terminal below) will now to explained<br>
For the explanation of the preferred embodiments of the invention the starting point is a corresponding configuration o"f the telecommunication arrangement as has already been discussed with reference to Figure 1. A telecommunication arrangement of this type again includes a data supply component or a data server D to supply user data objects (be they encrypted or unencrypted, packed into a container file or not etc.),a connection component G for forwarding the data or user data objects and finally a telecommunication device or terminal T of a user. Again the starting point is that the terminal T is located in a first telecommunication network embodied as a mobile radio network, in which the data in general and especially user data objects are transmitted by means of a protocol specified by the WAP Forum (WAP: Wireless Application Protocol). It is further assumed that the data supply component of a data or content provider is located in a second telecommunication network which is embodied as a network based on an Internet protocol (such as http). As a connection device to establish a data connection between the first telecommunication network and the second telecommunication network the communication component which serves in the configuration described as what is referred to as an WAP gateway is provided.<br>
For notifying the characteristics, especially relating to processing of specific user data objects to the data supply component D, in accordance with the method shown in Figure 1, the characteristics are represented in characteristic profiles or "UA profiles" (UA: User<br><br>
Agent preofile) which are advatntagously based on the metalanguage XML (XML Extensible Markup Language)XML –based formats are<br>
particularly suitable for platform-and  software-independent   exchange of structured data between programs  and computers   or  software  and hardware oaponents .of different manufacturers   and  systems.<br>
A profile can describe a number of components    (e.g.   for   software, hardware, ISf Push, etc.),  where each component  can  contain a  number of attributes and the associated values   (in  the  hardware   components for example possible attributes are  screen size,   color  display capabilities etc.)- A basic structure of a profile   is   shown below, as  has beeo defined by the WAP Forum for UA-Prof:<br>
Component _1 Attribute la = Valoe la Attribute » = Value Ib Component _2 Attribute 2a = Value 2a Attribute 2b = Value 2b Attribute 2c = Value 2c Attribute M = Value 2d<br>
This  type of sab-division has a number  of  advantages.   All   components and attriietes cm be used flexibly,   the   structure   can  be   expanded as  required an* also allows easy-to-understand presentation  options.<br>
A method in accordance with a preferred embodiment  of  the   invention now makes it passible on the server side,   that   is   on  the  part  of  the data  supply exponent, for a distinction to be made  between  the characteristics of the SRP-capable terminal  here  and  the  additional characteristics of the combination of the  WAP-capable  terminal  and further oapooents present in the data  transmission  network  such as the  connection component  (simply referred to below  as  WAP  gateways). Using  the KtJud shown in Figure 1 as  a   starting  point,   the<br><br>
Individual profile are UA profiles basic profile and a difference profile are identified as to there origin which also an. evaluation on the server side as   to  which  conversion   functionality of  the  WAP gateway or of a possible   additional   conversion   server, present,  for example in the  second  telecommunication  network,   can  be used in the transmission or assignment  of  content   (as   regards  user data  objects)  in a specific format   and  which  can  not.<br>
There  are different options  for  identifying  the  reference  of  a profile all of a UA-Prof:<br>
a)   in one of the simplest variants   the   identifier  only  distinguishes between  "terminal" and "intermediate  entity"   (such  as  WAP gateways). To  this  end the profile can be provided  with  simple  markings,   with the marking of the profile type also being  sufficient,   e.g.   the marking of the profile of intermediate  entities   (WAP gateways, conversion servers, etc.).  The advantage  of  this  variant   is   that changes  are not absolutely required  on  the  terminal   side  and  also  at the air  interface.<br>
b)   In  a   somewhat more complex variant   each  terminal   or  each component in the transmission path provides  a  separate profile  with an  individual, previously-agreed  code   (textual  or binary) .   For example  binary code "2" means:"  this  profile  originates   from  a  WAP gateway   ". A greater certainty compared  to  variant   a)   as   to  the source  from which a profile originates   is   advantageous   since  each profile   is to be identified here.   In  addition  further differentiation can be obtained if,   instead  of  a   simple marking (Boolean expression) a larger set  of values   is  used,   enabling  the categories *MAP-capafale terminal",    "WAP  gateway",    "WAP  proxy"    (as  a further  component in the transmission path)   and  further  components to be distinguished.<br><br>
c) This variant builkds on variant b)but also container the information about whether further   (difference,,   profiles  may  .be transmitted by subsequent units  or   components   in   the  transmission path.   For specific applications  it   thus  becomes  possible   to   suppress the  signaling of conversion options  by  the  WAP  gateway  and  other subsequent conversion units.<br>
The  application of a method in accordance with  an  embodiment  of  the invention,   for exanple on loading  DRM   (DRM:   Digital   Rights Management)  protected objects  and  also   for MMS   (MMS:   Multi  Media Messaging Service) has the advantage  that  the data  supply component or the  data supply server can look at  the  characteristics  of  the WAP-capable terminal alone and only  send  the  objects  or  user  data objects  suitable for it. Dnsuitable   objects   are  recognized  directly by  the  data supply component and not  transmitted,   so  the   user   is   not sent  unusable objects by Mistake.<br>
If the  data supply component is able  to  supply user  data  objects with  the same content but different  data  types,   an  identification  of characteristics in UA profiles,   i.e.   an assignment  of characteristics to a specific component  in the  transmission path has the  effect that the data supply component  always   selects   for transmission with higher priority a  user data  object  which  can be used on the terminal side without  conversion by an  intermediate component in the transmission path  such  as  the  WAP  gateway. Unnecessary data format conversions   are  thus   avoided.<br>
To  reiterate, in accordance with the  embodiment presented,   profiles and   (after merging of profiles)  profile  components  are   identified in accordance with their origin and the   server   side  distinction which this  makes possible between characteristics  of  the WAP-capable terminal and additional characteristics  of the  overall   system<br><br>
Consistin of the WAP capable terminal WAP gateway and possible further <br>
components on the transmission path  which  can   change   the   convene   co be transmitted. Bith the identification of  the  individual  profiles<br>
i<br>
or  UA-Profs the following questions  can  thus  be  resolved  on  a   server side  concerning the transmission unit   (WAP-capable   terminal,   WAP gateway, intermediate conversion unit  etc.)    from  which  the corresponding profile originates.  The   server  at  the   end  of   the transmission chain is intended to take  this   additional   information into account in selecting between different  available   file   types   and formats. In addition a unit has the opportunity of  suppressing further appending of difference profiles   it  necessary.<br>
At this poiat it staid be pointed out  once  again  that  the method described herein is not restricted to  the embodiments  given  as examples here, bat can also be applied to other WAP-based applications.<br>
The  advantages of the principles depicted above with regard  to  a method for transussioa of user data objects  using profiles   or  UA-Profs,   especially i» connection with the  delivery  of protected objects, the delivery of aultimedia messages   in  the  Multimedia Messaging Service aid for browsing on  the  basis   of  the  protocols specif ied ia the •» Fon» will now be  presented  in  detail.<br>
In accordamce with the following example   it   is   assumed  that   a  WAP-capable terminal which cannot display still   images   is  however expanded bf a plmm-im hardware Module to provide  this   function  so that it cam also display still images  in  the   "jpeg"   format.   As already explained abate, the terminal  is  connected to  the   Internet via a WAP tptenf *kk is further able  to convert  still   images   from the  "gif" fenat irto the "jpeg" format.   The  difference between  the<br><br>
Method described here thathe methods describe  at the beginning the reference to Figure 1 now lies in the fact that the profiles can be identified as regards their origin, This means that, in addition to the capabilities of the corresponding terminals or transmission units, the information about the terminal or the transmission unit such as the WAP gateway from which the relevant difference profile originates is included. These expanded profiles are indicated below by an asterisk. Otherwise the transmission and processing of the relevant profiles proceeds as already described with reference to Figure 1 which is why, for the explanation of the individual steps regarding the profiles expanded by an asterisk in the following text, reference is made to the explanation of the profile without the asterisk.<br>
Referring to Figure 1 the WAP-capable terminal T, as well as its basic profile BP* also transmits the difference profile DP3* (cf. step 5) , which describes the additional capabilities provided by the a hardware module plugged in at the WAP gateway G. As well as the two profiles of the WAP-capable terminal (basic profile BP* and difference profile DP3*} this also sends its own difference profile DP2* to the data supply component D (like the scenario depicted in Figure I).<br>
This means that the last element in the transmission chain or the transmission path (here the data supply component D) has knowledge when determining the resulting profile RP* (corresponding to the overall profile) about which capabilities the WAP-capable terminal (expanded with the module) possesses, namely here the display of still images in the "jpeg" data format, and which capabilities are to be assigned to an intermediate transmission unit, namely the conversion of still images in the "gif" data format into the "jpeg" data format by the WAP gateway.<br><br>
The semantics of the identification will be examined below of the variant describe above for identified the profile variant  c)   will be  used  below,   in  which  on   the   one   hand   the   function   of  the unit  described  in   the  profile   (WAP-capable   terminal,   WAP  gateway, etc.)   will  be  identified  and  on   the  other  hand  there  will   all   be   an indication of whether   further  profiles   of   subsequent   units   of  the transmission  chain may be  added.<br>
Figure  2  shows  a  table  in  accordance  with  an   advantageous   embodiment of a binary encoding   for  identification  of  profiles.   In  accordance with  this  table  a  WAP-capable  terminal   can   send  its  basic  profile either  with the  binary  identifier   "-1"   or   "0"   and  thereby  allow  or prevent the other  transmission  units   in   the   transmission  chain   from transmitting  their  difference  profiles.   The  next  element   in  the transmission  chain   (WAP-capable   terminal   with  add-on  module,   WAP gateway,  possibly WAP proxy or  conversion  server,   etc)   which  would like  to  a  supplement  a  difference  profile,   first  evaluates   the  basic profile  of  the  WAP-capable  terminal.   If   supplementing  of  difference profiles  is  allowed,   it   can  now  transfer   its   own  difference  profile with  a  corresponding  identification  in  accordance  with  the   table shown  in Figure  2.   In  this  way  it  would  be  possible   for   the  last element  in  the  transmission  chain   (i.e.   the   server)   to  distinguish between the various   (difference)   profiles.<br>
Independently of  this  each  terminal  or   each   transmission  unit   can additionally  sequentially number   its   profile.   In  this   case   the  data supply component  D would even  receive   information about  the  sequence of the network elements   involved  in  the   transmission  of  the  data<br>
The  syntax  of  the   identification  will   be   examined below.   Different options   for identifying a profile  will   now be  examined quite generally.   The examination will  no   longer  differentiate  between<br><br><br>
basic profile and difference profile (s) , In the identification the semantics described above in accordance with the table shown in Figure 2 should preferably be used, but any other previously agreed semantics are also conceivable however.<br>
Possible alternative embodiment options for identifying a profile are as follows:<br>
I. The transmission profile is prefixed by a new header field in the corresponding session layer (HTTP or WSP) . The two Session Layer protocols used here HTTP and WSP (WSP: Wireless Session Protocol) allow in accordance with [8] and [9] the definition of new header fields and use the textual formats described in [10] when doing so, in accordance with which a header field consists of a field name (mandatory) and a field value (optional) . So that not too much data has to be transmitted over the air interface WSP, [9] recommends binary encoding for frequently used ("well-known") "header fields. Thus for example from a field/attribute "X-Mms-Transmitter-Visibility: Show" (29 Bytes) the short form "93 11" in hexadecimal encoding (two bytes) is produced.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention the introduction of new header fields is proposed for identification of profiles which should also be based on the format described in [10] . The field name of the new header field for the two profiles described here HTTP and WSP could be called "x-wap-profile-source" for example.<br>
The presentation below shows the textually encoded header field "x-wap-profile-source" on the left with a textually encoded field value on the right with a binary-encoded (decimal) field value:<br>
x-wap-profile-source: WAP gateway; x-wap-profile-source: 2<br><br>
2.The tagging undertaken direrctly in the HTTP or WSP by an <br>
additional parameter- T.ai~ means that in principle the same information encoding as in the approach described under 1, is possible. To this end for example the definition of the header field "x-wap-profile" is expanded by a parameter or which allows the server-side assignment to a unit in the system.<br>
3. The profile is expanded by a new XML attribute. As already explained above, all profiles are advantageously described for a WAP UA-Prof.-based on XML. Self-contained information blocks or individual information is delimited within a profile by what are known as tags. Most of these tags occur in pairs in XML applications as start and end commands and specify the meaning of the text enclosed within them. This text can in its turn be subdivided by further tags for example to allow lists of parameters for an attribute. The parameters of the individual tags are called attributes. They are always enclosed within quotation marks ("
Figure 3 shows the use of the newly defined XML attributes "Source" (highlighted in bold; entire new element enclosed by double arrows) which allow a profile (or an individual profile component) to be identified by a terminal or by a transmission unit. When a new XML attribute is used the associated new XML "name space" must be referenced in the corresponding profile, identified in this example by "prf2". The value of this source attribute is encoded textually in Figure 3 (WAP GW or WAP Gateway) . Also conceivable is a binary encoding of the attribute value in accordance with the table in Figure 2 (e.g. "WAP Gateway" = "2")<br><br>
If one also wishes to implemnent a consecutive numbering of tprofile (as described above) with and of XML the following to option are a vailable for this purpose f parameters with different meanings. Figure 4 shows an example of this in which the attribute value of "source" consists of a list of two parameters, with the bracketing mechanism of attribute values described in the introduction being implemented: Within the attribute "Source", "Bag" signals that a number of attribute values follow (in accordance with the invention and new components are again enclosed within two brackets) . The expansion "Seq" in the brackets means that the sequence of the parameters in the list is of significance. By definition parameter 1 for example could stand for consecutive numbering and parameter 2 for the identification of the profile by a terminal or a further component in the transmission path (e.g. a network unit) , preferably by the code defined in the table in Figure 2.<br>
In addition to the textual encoding of UA-Profs or UA profiles shown here [7] also allows a binary method of representation in which all textual attributes are assigned what are known as binary tokens. Naturally the principles described above could also be expressed in a binary encoded UA-Prof.<br>
A method described above for the transmission of user data objects using attribute profiles or UA-Profs can also be applied for the transmission of DRM-protected objects. If, in this case, in the embodiment of the telecommunication arrangement described above or the profile transmission and processing of the relevant components<br><br><br>
Of a telecommunication arrangement of the WAP – capable terminal T of fig.1) DRM protect data is requested follow is as illustrated below.<br><br>
1. The WAP-capable terminal (T) sends a data request initially to the WAP gateway (G). This contains a basic profile BP* (let reference again be made to Figure 1 for the following explanations) and the difference profile DP3* for description of the add-on module. Both profiles are identified by the new information described above to indicate that they can be assigned to the WAP-capable terminal (T).<br>
2.	The WAP gateway (G) receives the data request and forwards it to<br>
the data supply component (D) . In doing so it supplements the data<br>
request by the difference profile DP2* which according to the new<br>
identification can be assigned to the WAP gateway.<br>
3.	The data supply component (D) receives the data request,<br>
evaluates the profile information and detects that the requested<br>
image can be used by the terminal (T) itself in the "jpeg" format<br>
and that the WAP gateway (G) can convert images from "gif" format<br>
into if format suitable for the terminal (this only means "jpeg"<br>
here) . If the object or the user data object (the image) is now to<br>
be transmitted in DRM-protected form, it must initially be packed or<br>
encrypted into another data format (e.g.<br>
"application/vnd.wap.drm.message or<br>
application/vnd.wap.drm.content") which would make it inaccessible for the WAP gateway (G) . The data supply component (D) thus decides to pack the object in the "jpeg" format into the DRM format so that processing of the object by the WAP gateway is not necessary. The data supply component (D) sends the object or user data object to the WAP gateway in the format described.<br><br>
4. The WAP  gateway received the object that to processing of the object or an action by the WAP gateway G is essary and transmits it to the terminal (T) ,<br>
5, The terminal receives the object, unpacks it and can use it.<br>
Without the procedure described above in accordance with an embodiment of the invention the same process would appear as follows:<br>
1.	The WAP-capable terminal (T) sends a data request initially to<br>
the WAP gateway (G) . This contains the basic profile BP and the<br>
difference profile DP3 for description of the supplementary module<br>
(again of. Figure 1) .<br>
2.	The WAP gateway (G) receives the data request and forwards it,<br>
supplemented by the difference profile DP2, to the data supply<br>
component (D).<br>
3.	The data supply component (D) receives the data request,<br>
evaluates the profile information and recognizes that the requested<br>
data or the requested image can be used by the combination of<br>
terminal (T) and WAP gateway (G) in "jpeg format" and in "gif<br>
format". The object is to be transmitted in DRM-protected form and<br>
to this end must first be packed into another data format<br>
(application/vnd. wap. drm. message or application/vnd. wap . drm. content)<br>
which makes it inaccessible to the WAP gateway. The data supply component of (D) may possibly decide to pack the object in the "gif" format into the DRM format, and sends the object to the WAP gateway (G) in the format described.<br>
4. The WAP gateway (G) receives the object, recognizes that it cannot process the object since it does not recognize the data<br><br>
format enclosing it or cannot process this format does not change the object and<br>
 transmits it to the terminwl <br>
5. The terminal (T) receives the object, unpacks it from the enclosing data format and can however not use it.<br>
