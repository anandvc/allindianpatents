ELECTRIC MOTOR POWER CONNECTION ASSEMBLY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to an electric power connection assembly with a<br>
heat-diverting mechanism for an electric motor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Electric motors, such as those used in a hybrid electro-mechanical<br>
transmission, include a stator powered by electric current fed to stator windings. The<br>
stator windings operate at high current densities, and can reach relatively high<br>
temperatures of 180 degrees Fahrenheit or more. Electric power for the motor is<br>
supplied by a power source, such as a direct voltage battery, and is converted to<br>
alternating current by a power inverter. The power is then fed via power cables<br>
through terminal connections to motor wires or conductor bars that are connected to<br>
the stator windings. The electric current must pass through and be electrically<br>
insulated from the transmission casing when traveling from the inverter to the stator<br>
windings. The electric current passing through the power cables causes heating<br>
within the cables themselves, and the electrical insulation on the outside of the cables<br>
impedes the passing of heat from the cables to their operating environment such as<br>
under a car or in an engine compartment. The high operating temperature of the stator<br>
windings may cause additional heat to pass to the motor wires or conductor bars and<br>
even further to the power cables, thus increasing the heat load on the cables, as these<br>
electrically-conductive components are also typically good heat conductors. Because<br>
power cables have relatively flexible insulation, they typically cannot operate at the<br>
high temperatures typical of stator windings,, and they must be designed with a larger<br>
size (i.e., a larger effective current-carrying cross-sectional area) to keep their<br>
operating temperatures within an acceptable working range.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	An electric motor power connection assembly diverts heat from an<br>
electrical conductor that carries electric current between a power source and an<br>
electric motor. The heat diversion prevents undesirable heating of components, such<br>
as power cables that extend from a power inverter to supply current to the stator<br>
windings. The electrical conductor is characterized by an effective cross-sectional<br>
area perpendicular to the direction of current flow and a length in the direction of<br>
current flow that is greater than the radius of a circle having the effective cross-<br>
sectional area. The "effective cross-sectional area" is the area perpendicular to the<br>
direction of current flow through which current is carried and thus depends on the<br>
cross-sectional shape and number of conductive components of the electrical<br>
conductor, which could be one or more wires. The electrical conductor is positioned<br>
in thermal contact with a heat-diverting mechanism to divert heat from the electrical<br>
conductor. The electrical conductor is in thermal contact with the heat-diverting<br>
mechanism along a length of the electrical conductor which may be referred to as the<br>
"cooled length" and need not be the entire length of the electrical conductor.<br>
Preferably, the cooled length is at least three times the radius of a circle with the<br>
effective cross-sectional area in order to improve the efficiency of heat diversion.<br>
[0004]	In one embodiment, the electrical conductor is an extended terminal,<br>
such as a ring terminal secured to a power cable, and the heat-diverting mechanism is<br>
a cooling fluid applied along the cooled length of the extended terminal. The<br>
extended terminal may be secured to a motor terminal (which is secured to the motor<br>
wire) by extending a threaded bolt through both the extended terminal and the motor<br>
terminal and then securing the bolt to a threaded terminal block. This allows current<br>
to flow from the extended terminal to the motor terminal and thereon to the motor<br>
wire.<br><br>
[0005]	In another embodiment, the electrical conductor is the extended<br>
terminal secured to the power cable as described above, but the heat-diverting<br>
mechanism is an electrical insulator enclosing the extended terminal along its cooled<br>
length to define a cooling passage therebetweeen. The electrical insulator has an<br>
opening that is in fluid communication with pressurized fluid that is directed through<br>
the opening and through the passage along the cooled length to cool the extended<br>
terminal. The electrical insulator may be two semi-cylindrical components<br>
configured with radially-inward extending extensions sized so that the insulator<br>
contacts the outer periphery of the extended terminal only at the extensions, leaving<br>
the cooling passage substantially surrounding the insulator and permitting maximum<br>
thermal contact of the pressurized fluid over the periphery.<br>
[0006]	In another embodiment, the electrical conductor is an exposed portion<br>
of the power cable over which the current flows from the power source. For example,<br>
a sheath or electrically-insulating protective coating is removed from the power cable<br>
along the cooled length, exposing "bare" power cable wires. In this embodiment, the<br>
heat-diverting mechanism is a thermally-conductive electrical insulator in thermal<br>
contact with the exposed portion (i.e., the bare power cable wires) to draw heat away<br>
from the power cable.<br>
[0007]	In yet another embodiment, the electrical conductor is an electrical bus<br>
bar, such as in a power inverter that supplies the power from the power source to the<br>
power cable. The heat-diverting mechanism is a thermally-conductive electric<br>
insulator in thermal contact with the bus bar. A heat sink may be placed in contact<br>
with the thermally-conductive electric insulator to draw the heat away from the<br>
insulator.<br><br>
[0008]	A hybrid transmission within the scope of the invention includes a<br>
transmission casing defining a transmission cavity. A power source, such as a battery,<br>
is located outside of the cavity. An electric motor located inside of the cavity powers<br>
the transmission in conjunction with another power plant, such as an internal<br>
combustion engine, through a transmission gearing arrangement. The electric motor<br>
is operatively connected to the power source and is powered by electric current that is<br>
fed through an inverter and other components, such as a power cable and a motor<br>
wire, to the motor. An electrical conductor and heat-diverting mechanism according<br>
to any of the above-described embodiments is used to prevent undesirable heating of<br>
the power cable. A power cable with an overall length not greater than 1000 times the<br>
radius of a circle with its effective cross-sectional area, and preferably 100 to 300<br>
times the radius, is typical of power cables used in hybrid motor vehicle applications.<br>
This length to cross-sectional radius ratio is relatively small in comparison to that of<br>
power cable conductors used in other power connection applications, such as<br>
underground electric cables. The flexible electrical insulation typically used on the<br>
outside of power cables aboard vehicles has a thermal conductivity more than 10,000<br>
times worse than the electrical conductor of the cable, and the thickness of the<br>
insulation is more than a tenth of the radius of the conductor. The relatively small<br>
ratio of power cable length to effective cross-sectional radius enables successful<br>
prevention of unwanted heating of the entire length of the power cable to take place<br>
even with heat diversion occurring only at one or both ends of the power cable. Thus,<br>
the electric motor power connection assembly described above is suitable for<br>
implementation on a hybrid motor vehicle transmission.<br>
[0009]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0017]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, a portion of a hybrid powertrain 10 for a vehicle is shown. The hybrid<br>
powertrain 10 includes a hybrid transmission 12. The transmission 12 includes a<br>
transmission casing 14 that defines a transmission cavity 16 in which an electric<br>
motor 18 is housed. The electric motor 18 may also be referred to as a<br>
motor/generator, as it may be utilized both to provide motive power through a<br>
transmission gearing arrangement 20 and to generate electrical energy from rotary<br>
power of the transmission gearing arrangement, as is known. Although only one<br><br>
motor 18 is shown for purposes of illustrating the invention described herein, the<br>
powertrain 10 may include one or more additional motors. The motor 18 includes a<br>
stator 22 having electrical windings 24 that receive electric current through motor<br>
wires 26, with each phase of alternating current being provided on a separate motor<br>
wire or set of wires. As shown in Figures 1 and 3, the motor wires 26 preferably lead<br>
into and become integrated with the windings 24. The motor 18 also includes a rotor<br>
28 concentrically surrounded by the stator 22. Electrical power in the stator 22 causes<br>
rotary motion of the rotor 28, or vice versa, which affects rotary torque in the<br>
transmission gearing arrangement 20. An engine, not shown, is also operatively<br>
connected to the transmission gearing arrangement 20 such that either or both the<br>
engine and motor 18 can affect speed and torque ratios between an input member (not<br>
shown) and an output member (not shown), also operatively connected to the<br>
transmission gearing arrangement 20 and extending through the casing 14, as is<br>
known to those skilled in the art, to provide tractive motion.<br>
[0018]	Alternating electric current in the motor wires 26 is provided from or<br>
to a power source 30, which is preferably a direct current battery. Power from the<br>
direct current battery 30 is converted to alternating current by a power inverter 32. A<br>
power cable 33 operatively connects the power inverter 32 with the motor wires 26.<br>
Only one power cable 33 is shown for purposes of illustrating the invention; however,<br>
a separate power cable is required to provide each separate phase of alternating<br>
current to motor windings 24 of different phases. The power cable 33 is shown in<br>
fragmented form and has a cable sheath 34 forming a protective, electrically-<br>
insulating cover.<br>
[0019]	The hybrid transmission 12 utilizes multiple electric motor power<br>
connection assemblies to manage the heat associated with the relatively high<br>
operating temperatures of the stator windings 24, and to minimize and control the<br>
effect of such heat on the power cable 33 to minimize the required size of the power<br>
cable 33, thus reducing cost and weight. Within the scope of the invention, any one<br>
of these electric motor power connection assemblies may be sufficient by itself to<br><br>
meet target heat control objectives of a particular hybrid transmission application, or<br>
the various electric motor power connection assemblies may be used in different<br>
combinations.<br>
[0020]	The hybrid transmission 12 utilizes a first electric motor power<br>
connection assembly 38 that includes an extended ring terminal 40 crimped on one<br>
end of the power cable 33. The extended ring terminal 40 extends through an opening<br>
42 in the casing 14. An electrical insulator 44 also extends through the opening 42<br>
and supports the extended ring terminal 40. The electrical insulator 44 may be a soft<br>
rubber material with an upper and a lower portion forming semi-cylindrical openings<br>
that mate to support the cable 33 and extended ring terminal 40 shown, as well as<br>
additional ring terminals and cables (not shown) adjacent one another at the casing 14<br>
providing current at different phases to the stator windings 26. An O-ring 43 forms a<br>
seal between the extended ring terminal 40 and the electrical insulator 44. The<br>
extended ring terminal 40 is electrically conductive and has an effective cross-<br>
sectional area through which current is carried. In the embodiment of Figure 1, the<br>
extended ring terminal 40 is circular in cross-section, as shown in Figure 2, and<br>
therefore has an effective cross-sectional area of:<br>
πr2, where r is the radius of the cross-section.<br>
Within the scope of the invention, the extended ring terminal 40 may have alternative<br>
cross-sectional shapes with the same effective cross-sectional areas. With an<br>
alternative shape, a radius may be calculated for a circle having the same area as the<br>
effective cross-sectional area of the alternative shape, (e.g. an effective cross-<br>
sectional area of a square 7 units wide and 7 units high is 49 square units, and a circle<br>
with a radius of 4 units has an area of 16K square units or slightly more than 49 square<br>
units, so that the radius of a circle with the same area as the square is slightly less than<br>
4 units.)<br><br>
[0021]	The first electric motor power connection assembly 38 also includes a<br>
heat-diverting mechanism 48, which in this case is a cooling liquid, applied over a<br>
cooled length L1 of the extended ring terminal 40. The cooled length L1 is not<br>
necessarily the entire length of the extended ring terminal 40, but must be greater than<br>
the radius of a circle with the effective cross-sectional area of the extended ring<br>
terminal 40 in order to provide effective cooling. The heat-diverting mechanism 48<br>
(i.e., the cooling liquid) is supplied via a liquid directing device 49 that may be a fluid<br>
channel or other fluid containing mechanism, may or may not be pressurized, and<br>
may include a spray nozzle.<br>
[0022]	An electrically conductive motor ring terminal 50 is crimped to the end<br>
of motor wires 26. A threaded bolt 52 extends through openings in each of the<br>
extended ring terminal 40 and the motor ring terminal 50 to secure the respective<br>
terminals in electrical contact with one another. The threaded bolt 52 is in turn<br>
secured to a threaded terminal block 54. Current passes between the motor wires 26<br>
and the power cables 33 through the contacting terminals 40, 50. The direction of<br>
current flow is along the length L1, perpendicular to the cross-sectional area shown in<br>
Figure 2. Because the motor wires 26, ring terminals 40 and 50 and power cable 33<br>
are all good electrical conductors, they are also generally good heat conductors. The<br>
heat diverting mechanism 48 applied to the extended ring terminal 40 minimizes the<br>
heat passed from the motor wires 26 to the power cables 33.<br>
[0023]	A second electric motor power connection assembly 60 is utilized at<br>
the opposing end of the power cable 33 to further control and minimize heating of the<br>
power cable 33. The second electric motor power connection assembly 60 includes<br>
an electrical bus bar 62 which supplies the alternating current converted within the<br>
power inverter 32 to one or more devices in need of alternating current, including the<br>
power cable 33. (Additional power cables (not shown) that provide current at<br>
differing phases to the stator windings 24 are operatively connected to the bus bar 62<br>
in similar fashion.) An electrical connection between the bus bar 62 and the power<br>
cable 33 is provided by an electrically-conductive ring terminal 64 crimped to the end<br><br>
of the power cable 33 and secured to the bus bar 62 by a threaded bolt 66 that extends<br>
through a threaded opening in the bus bar 62. The electrically-conductive ring<br>
terminal 64, as well as all other terminals described herein, may be secured by any<br>
known means as an alternative to crimping. A thermally-conductive electrical<br>
insulator 68 is in thermal contact with the bus bar 62, running in contact with a<br>
bottom surface of the bus bar 62 for at least a length L2, which is referred to as the<br>
cooled length. The bus bar 62 and thermally-conductive electrical insulator 68 are<br>
actually in thermal contact for a greater length than the cooled length L2 shown, as<br>
only a fragment of the total length of the bus bar 62 and thermally-conductive<br>
electrical insulator 68 are shown. However, the length L2 is a sufficient cooled length<br>
within the scope of the invention, as it is greater than a radius of a circle having the<br>
same area as the effective cross-sectional area of the bus bar 62 carrying current. The<br>
effective cross-sectional area of the bus bar 62 is the width W times the height H of<br>
the bus bar 62. Current runs in the direction of the length L2, perpendicular to the<br>
effective cross-sectional area. A heat sink 70 is in thermal contact with the thermally-<br>
conductive electrical insulator 68 and pulls heat therefrom. Cooling fins 72 may<br>
extend from the heat sink to increase the cooling rate of the bus bar 62. The heat sink<br>
70 is secured to walls or other structure of the power inverter 32. The bolt 66 may<br>
also extend through the thermally-conductive electrical insulator 68 and the heat sink<br>
70. Should the temperature of the power cable 33 and ring terminal 64 exceed the<br>
temperature of the bus bar 62, heat will flow from the power cable 33 to the bus bar<br>
62 and will be dispersed through the thermally-conductive electrical insulator 68 and<br>
the heat sink 70.<br>
[0024]	Figure 3 illustrates the powertrain 10 in partially exploded view,<br>
showing the second electric motor power connection assembly 60 at one end of the<br>
power cable 33 with the bus bar 62 in contact with the electrical insulator 68 and the<br>
heat sink 70, all secured to the inverter 32. The power source 30 is not shown. The<br>
first electric motor power connection assembly 38 is shown at the other end of the<br>
power cable 33, including the extended ring terminal 40 aligned to be inserted through<br><br>
the electrical insulator 44 for operative connection with the motor wires 26 via the<br>
motor ring terminal 50 so that the heat diverting mechanism 48 (i.e., cooling liquid) is<br>
in thermal contact with the extended ring terminal 40.<br>
[0025]	Referring to Figures 4 and 5, an alternative embodiment of an electric<br>
motor power connection assembly 138 within the scope of the invention is shown.<br>
The power cable 33 includes an exposed portion 136 not covered by the cable sheath<br>
34. The exposed portion 136 is in direct contact with a heat-diverting mechanism 148<br>
along a length L3. The heat-diverting mechanism 148 is a thermally-conductive<br>
electrical insulator. As is evident in Figure 5, the thermally-conductive electrical<br>
insulator 148 includes a first portion 149 and a second portion 151, each of which is<br>
semi-cylindrical in shape and contacts the power cable 33. As seen in Figure 5, the<br>
power cable 33 includes a number of separate power wires 153 bundled together, each<br>
having a separate cylindrical shape. The effective cross-sectional area of the power<br>
cable 33 is:<br>
 πr2*n, where n is the number of separate power wires in the power<br>
cable and r is the radius of each wire.<br>
Each power wire 153 is in thermal contact with another power wire and/or with the<br>
thermally-conductive electrical insulator 148 to promote heat dissipation through the<br>
thermally-conductive electrical insulator 148. The thermally-conductive electrical<br>
insulator 148 may be subjected to liquid cooling at the outer surface thereof to further<br>
cool the electrical insulator and promote heat flow out of the power cable 33. A<br>
sealing O-ring 143 seals a ring terminal 140 crimped on the power cable 33 to prevent<br>
liquid within the cavity 16 from being wicked out through the exposed power cable<br>
33. The threaded bolt 52 extends through openings in the motor ring terminal 50 and<br>
the ring terminal 140 and is secured to the threaded terminal block 54. Another<br>
sealing O-ring 155 surrounds the power cable sheath 34 and seals the sheath 34 with<br>
the surrounding thermally-conductive electrical insulator 148 to prevent moisture<br>
from entering into contact with the exposed portion 136 from outside of the<br>
transmission cavity 16.<br><br>
[0026]	Referring to Figures 6 and 7, another embodiment of an electric motor<br>
power connection assembly 238 is illustrated. The electric motor power connection<br>
assembly 238 includes an extended ring terminal 240 crimped to the end of the power<br>
cable 33. An electrical insulator 248 surrounds the extended ring terminal 240, and<br>
both are inserted through the opening 42 in the casing 14. As shown in Figure 7, the<br>
electrical insulator 248 includes a semi-cylindrical upper portion 249 and a semi-<br>
cylindrical lower portion 251 sized to surround the extended ring terminal to define a<br>
cooling passage 261 between an outer surface of the extended ring terminal 240 and<br>
the electrical insulator 248. The electrical insulator 248 contacts the extended ring<br>
terminal 240 only at small protrusions 263 formed in the electrical insulator 248 so<br>
that the cooling passage 261 remains generally annular and exposure of the outer<br>
surface of the extended ring terminal 240 is maximized. The protrusions 263 support<br>
and center the extended ring terminal 240 and extend only minimally along the length<br>
of the extended ring terminal 240. A sealing O-ring 243 is secured around the<br>
extended ring terminal 240 to close off and seal one end of the cooling passage 261.<br>
The other end 245 of the cooling passage 261 is open to the transmission cavity 16.<br>
The electrical insulator 248 has a radially-extending opening 265 extending from the<br>
cooling passage 261 to the outer surface of the electrical insulator 248. As shown in<br>
Figure 6, the opening 265 is in fluid communication via a channel 267 that may be<br>
formed in the casing 14 (or alternatively by a tube or other means) to a source of<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
ELECTRIC MOTOR POWER CONNECTION ASSEMBLY<br>
An electric motor power connection assembly diverts heat from an<br>
electrical conductor that carries electrical current between a power source and<br>
an electric motor. The electrical conductor is characterized by an effective crosssectional area perpendicular to the direction of current flow and a length in the<br>
direction of current flow that is grater than the radius of a circle having the<br>
effective cross-sectional area. The "effective cross-sectional area" is the area<br>
perpendicular to the direction of current flow over which current is carried and<br>
thus depends on the cross-sectional shape and number of conductive<br>
components of the electrical conductor, which could be one or more wires. A<br>
heat diverting mechanism is positioned in thermal contact along the length of the<br>
electrical conductor to divert heat from the electrical conductor. The electric<br>
motor power connection assembly is suitable for use in a hybrid electro-<br>
mechanical transmission.</td>
