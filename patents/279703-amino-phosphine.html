AMINO PHOSPHINE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention provides a new P-N-P ligand. The ligand is useful in<br>
ethylene oligomerization reactions.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Alpha olefins are commercially produced by the oligomerization of<br>
ethylene in the presence of a simple alkyl aluminum catalyst (in the so<br>
called "chain growth" process) or alternatively, in the presence of an<br>
organometallic nickel catalyst (in the so called Shell Higher Olefins, or<br>
"SHOP" process). Both of these processes typically produce a crude<br>
oligomer product having a broad distribution of alpha olefins with an even<br>
number of carbon atoms (i.e. butene-1, hexene-1, octene-1 etc.). The<br>
various alpha olefins in the crude oligomer product are then typically<br>
separated in a series of distillation columns. Butene-1 is generally the<br>
least valuable of these olefins as it is also produced in large quantities as a<br>
by-product in various cracking and refining processes. Hexene-1 and<br>
octene-1 often command comparatively high prices because these olefins<br>
are in high demand as comonomers for linear low density polyethylene<br>
(LLDPE).<br>
Technology for the selective trimerization of ethylene to hexene-1<br>
has been recently put into commercial use in response to the demand for<br>
hexene-1. The patent literature discloses catalysts which comprise a<br>
chromium source and a pyrrolide ligand as being useful for this process -<br>
see, for example, United States Patent ("USP") 5,198,563 (Reagen et al.,<br>
assigned to Phillips Petroleum).<br>
Another family of highly active trimerization catalysts is disclosed by<br>
Wass et al. in WO 02/04119 (now United States Patents 7,143,633 and<br>
6,800,702. The catalysts disclosed by Wass et al. are formed from a<br>
chromium source and a chelating diphosphine ligand and are described in<br>
further detail by Carter et al. (Chem. Comm. 2002, p 858-9). As described<br>
 <br>
in the Chem. Comm. paper, these catalysts preferably comprise a<br>
diphosphine ligand in which both phosphine atoms are bonded to two<br>
phenyl groups that are each substituted with an ortho-methoxy group.<br>
Hexene-1 is produced with high activity and high selectivity by these<br>
catalysts.<br>
Similar diphosphine/tetraphenyl ligands are disclosed by Blann et<br>
al. in WO04/056478 and WO 04/056479 (now US 2006/0229480 and US<br>
2006/0173226). However, in comparison to the ligands of Wass et al., the<br>
disphosphine/tetraphenyl ligands disclosed by Blann et al. generally do not<br>
contain polar substituents in ortho positions. The "tetraphenyl"<br>
diphosphine ligands claimed in the '480 application must not have ortho<br>
substituents (of any kind) on all four of the phenyl groups and the<br>
"tetraphenyl" diphosphine ligands claimed in '226 are characterized by<br>
having a polar substituent in a meta or para position. Both of these<br>
approaches are shown to reduce the amount of hexenes produced and<br>
increase the amount of octene (in comparison to the ligands of Wass et<br>
al.). However, the hexene fraction generally contains a large portion of<br>
internal hexenes, which is undesirable. Thus, chromium based catalysts<br>
which contain the ligands of Wass et al. typically produce more octene<br>
(which may be advantageous if demand for octene is high) but these<br>
ligands have the disadvantage of producing a hexene stream which is<br>
contaminated with a comparatively large amount of internal olefins.<br>
Internal olefins are undesirable contaminants in linear low density<br>
polyethylene (LLDPE) production facilities because the internal olefins are<br>
not readily incorporated into LLDPE with most transition metal catalysts.<br>
Thus, it is preferable to remove/separate internal olefins from alpha olefins<br>
if the alpha olefin is to be used in an LLDPE process. As will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art, it is comparatively difficult to<br>
separate hexene-1 from internal hexenes by distillation due to the close<br>
boiling points of these hexene resins.<br>
 <br>
Accordingly, a process which selectively produces a mixture of<br>
hexene-1 and octene-1 with very low levels of internal olefins represents a<br>
desirable addition to the art.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a new molecule<br>
defined by the formula:<br>
 <br>
wherein R is isopropyl.<br>
The molecule is particularly suitable for use as a ligand in a process<br>
to oligomerize ethylene. Potential alternative uses include ligands for<br>
hydrogenation and/or hydroformylation reactions.<br>
Attempts to produce the new molecule by conventional<br>
condensation reactions (i.e., using a precursor amine and a precursor<br>
diphosphine chloride) were unsuccessful. Accordingly, another<br>
embodiment of this invention provides a new synthetic route to this<br>
molecule. A preferred synthesis uses a molecule defined by the formula<br>
(ortho - F - C6H4)2PX wherein X is chlorine and bromine and is described<br>
in more detail in the Examples.<br>
Another embodiment of this invention provides a process to<br>
oligomerize ethylene. A process for the selective oligomerization of<br>
ethylene to a mixture comprising hexene-1 and octene-1, said process<br>
comprising contacting ethylene under oligomerization reaction conditions<br>
with a catalyst system to produce an oligomerization product comprising<br>
hexene-1 and octene-1, said catalyst system comprising:<br>
i) a source of chromium;<br>
 <br>
ii) a ligand defined by the formula<br>
 <br>
wherein each of X1 to X4 is independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of F, Br, or CI; and each of R; ort1 to ort4 and R1 to R12 is<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of H and "non-<br>
interfering substituents" (i.e. substituents that do not interfere with<br>
the oligomerization reaction);<br>
and<br>
iii) an activator.<br>
In general, the ligand used in the oligomerization process of this<br>
invention has four ortho halide substituents - more specifically, each of the<br>
four phenyl groups has an ortho halide substituent. In the most general<br>
sense, each of ort1 to ort4, X1 to X4 and R1 to R12 are hydrogen or "non-<br>
interfering substituents" (wherein the term simply means that the<br>
substituents do not interfere with the oligomerization process).<br>
The oligomerization process of this invention may be conducted<br>
under conventional oligomerization conditions. One important advantage<br>
of the present invention is that the product olefins can comprise a<br>
desirable mixture of hexene and octene (in particular, greater than 80<br>
weight% of the ethylene that is converted to a liquid product during the<br>
process can be hexenes and octenes) with very low levels of internal<br>
olefins (preferably less than 15 weight% of the mixed hexene and octene<br>
stream is internal olefins) when the process is conducted under preferred<br>
temperature and pressure conditions.<br>
 <br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
PART A CATALYST SYSTEM<br>
The catalyst system used in the process of the present invention<br>
must contain three essential components, namely:<br>
(i) a source of chromium:<br>
(ii) amino diphosphine ligand; and<br>
(iii) an activator.<br>
Preferred forms of each of these components are discussed below.<br>
Chromium Source ("Component (i)")<br>
Any source of chromium which allows the oligomerization process<br>
of the present invention to proceed may be used. Preferred chromium<br>
sources include chromium trichloride; chromium (III) 2-ethylhexanoate;<br>
chromium (III) acetylacetonate and chromium carboxyl complexes such as<br>
chromium hexacarboxyl.<br>
Ligand Used in the Oligomerization Process ("Component (ii)")<br>
In general, the ligand used in the oligomerization process of this<br>
invention is defined by the formula:<br>
 <br>
wherein each of X1 to X4 is independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of F, Br, or CI; and each of R; ort1 to ort4 and R1 to R12 is<br>
independently selected from the group consisting of H and "non-interfering<br>
substituents" (i.e. substituents that do not interfere with the oligomerization<br>
reaction).<br>
 <br>
Each of X1 to X4 is preferably fluorine.<br>
R is preferably a hydrocarbyl group having from 1 to 30 carbon<br>
atoms. The hydrocarbyl groups may contain heteroatom substituents<br>
(having a heteroatom selected from O, N, P and S). Simple alkyl groups<br>
having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms are preferred. Isopropyl is particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
Each of ort1 to ort4 is preferably selected from the group consisting<br>
of H, Br, CI, F and small alkyl groups (having from 1 to 3 carbon atoms). H<br>
is most preferred.<br>
Each of R1 to R12 is independently selected from the group<br>
consisting of H, hydrocarbyl substituents which contain from 1 to 30<br>
carbon atoms (which hydrocarbyl substituents may contain heteroatoms<br>
selected from the group consisting of O, N, P and S) and heteroatom<br>
substituents (i.e. substituents which are bonded to the phenyl ring via an<br>
O, N, P or S atom) which contain from 2 to 30 atoms. It is preferred that<br>
R1 to R12 are not polar substituents. It is especially preferred that each of<br>
R1 to R12 is selected from H and C1 to C6 alkyls or C6 to C12 aryls.<br>
Activator ("Component flip")<br>
The activator (component (iii)) may be any compound that<br>
generates an active catalyst for ethylene oligomerization with components<br>
(i) and (ii). Mixtures of activators may also be used. Suitable compounds<br>
include organoaluminum compounds, organoboron compounds and<br>
inorganic acids and salts, such as tetrafluoroboric acid etherate, silver<br>
tetrafluoroborate, sodium hexafluoroantimonate and the like. Suitable<br>
organoaluminium compounds include compounds of the formula AIR3,<br>
where each R is independently C1 -C12 alkyl, oxygen or halide, and<br>
compounds such as LiAIH4 and the like. Examples include<br>
trimethylaluminium (TMA), triethylaluminium (TEA), tri-isobutylaluminium<br>
(TIBA), tri-n-octylaluminium, methylaluminium dichloride, ethylaluminium<br>
dichloride, dimethylaluminium chloride, diethylaluminium chloride,<br>
ethylaluminiumsesquichloride, methylaluminiumsesquichloride, and<br>
alumoxanes. Alumoxanes are well known in the art as typically oligomeric<br>
 <br>
compounds which can be prepared by the controlled addition of water to<br>
an alkylaluminium compound, for example trimethylaluminium. Such<br>
compounds can be linear, cyclic, cages or mixtures thereof. Commercially<br>
available alumoxanes are generally believed to be mixtures of linear and<br>
cyclic compounds. The cyclic alumoxanes can be represented by the<br>
formula [R6AIO]s and the linear alumoxanes by the formula R7(R8AIO)s<br>
wherein s is a number from about 2 to 50, and wherein R6, R7, and R8<br>
represent hydrocarbyl groups, preferably C1 to C6 alkyl groups, for<br>
example methyl, ethyl or butyl groups. Alkylalumoxanes especially<br>
methylalumoxane (MAO) are preferred.<br>
It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that commercially<br>
available alkylalumoxanes may contain a proportion of trialkylaluminium.<br>
For instance, commercial MAO usually contains approximately 10 wt %<br>
trimethylaluminium (TMA), and commercial "modified MAO" (or "MMAO")<br>
contains both TMA and TIBA. Quantities of alkylalumoxane are generally<br>
quoted herein on a molar basis of aluminium (and include such "free"<br>
trialkylaluminium).<br>
Examples of suitable organoboron compounds are boroxines,<br>
NaBH4, trimethylboron, triethylboron,<br>
dimethylphenylammoniumtetra(phenyl)borate, trityltetra(phenyl)borate,<br>
triphenylboron, dimethylphenylammonium tetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate,<br>
sodium tetrakis[(bis-3,5-trifluoromethyl)phenyl]borate,<br>
trityltetra(pentafluorophenyl)borate and tris(pentafluorophenyl) boron.<br>
Activator compound (iii) may also be or contain a compound that<br>
acts as a reducing or oxidizing agent, such as sodium or zinc metal and<br>
the like, or oxygen and the like.<br>
In the preparation of the catalyst systems used in the present<br>
invention, the quantity of activating compound to be employed is easily<br>
determined by simple testing, for example, by the preparation of small test<br>
samples which can be used to oligimerize small quantities of ethylene and<br>
thus to determine the activity of the produced catalyst. It is generally<br>
found that the quantity employed is sufficient to provide 0.5 to 1000 moles<br>
 <br>
of aluminium (or boron) per mole of chromium. MAO is the presently<br>
preferred activator. Molar Al/Cr ratios of from 1/1 to 500/1 are preferred.<br>
PART B PROCESS CONDITIONS<br>
The chromium (component (i)) and ligand (component (ii)) may be<br>
present in any molar ratio which produces oligomer, preferably between<br>
100:1 and 1:100, and most preferably from 10:1 to 1:10, particularly 3:1 to<br>
1:3. Generally the amounts of (i) and (ii) are approximately equal, i.e. a<br>
ratio of between 1.5:1 and 1:1.5.<br>
Components (i)-(iii) of the catalyst system utilized in the present<br>
invention may be added together simultaneously or sequentially, in any<br>
order, and in the presence or absence of ethylene in any suitable solvent,<br>
so as to give an active catalyst. For example, components (i), (ii) and (iii)<br>
and ethylene may be contacted together simultaneously, or components<br>
(i), (ii) and (iii) may be added together simultaneously or sequentially in<br>
any order and then contacted with ethylene, or components (i) and (ii) may<br>
be added together to form an isolable metal-ligand complex and then<br>
added to component (iii) and contacted with ethylene, or components (i),<br>
(ii) and (iii) may be added together to form an isolable metal-ligand<br>
complex and then contacted with ethylene. Suitable solvents for<br>
contacting the components of the catalyst or catalyst system include, but<br>
are not limited to, hydrocarbon solvents such as heptane, toluene, 1-<br>
hexene and the like, and polar solvents such as diethyl ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran, acetonitrile, dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene,<br>
methanol, acetone and the like.<br>
The catalyst components (i), (ii) and (iii) utilized in the present<br>
invention can be unsupported or supported on a support material, for<br>
example, silica, alumina, MgCl2 or zirconia, or on a polymer, for example<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or poly(aminostyrene). If<br>
desired the catalysts can be formed in situ in the presence of the support<br>
material, or the support material can be pre-impregnated or premixed,<br>
simultaneously or sequentially, with one or more of the catalyst<br>
components. The quantity of support material employed can vary widely,<br>
 <br>
for example from 100,000 to 1 grams per gram of metal present in the<br>
transition metal compound. In some cases, the support may material can<br>
also act as or as a component of the activator compound (iii). Examples<br>
include supports containing alumoxane moieties.<br>
The oligomerization can be, conducted under solution phase, slurry<br>
phase, gas phase or bulk phase conditions. Suitable temperatures range<br>
from 10° C to +300° C preferably from 10° C to 100° C, especially from 20<br>
to 70° C. Suitable pressures are from atmospheric to 800 atmospheres<br>
(gauge) preferably from 5 atmospheres to 100 atmospheres, especially<br>
from 10 to 50 atmospheres.<br>
Irrespective of the process conditions employed, the oligomerization<br>
is typically carried out under conditions that substantially exclude oxygen,<br>
water, and other materials that act as catalyst poisons. Also,<br>
oligomerization can be carried out in the presence of additives to control<br>
selectivity, enhance activity and reduce the amount of polymer formed in<br>
oligomerization processes. Potentially suitable additives include, but are<br>
not limited to, hydrogen or a halide source.<br>
There exist a number of options for the oligomerization reactor<br>
including batch, semi-batch, and continuous operation. The reactions of<br>
the present invention can be performed under a range of process<br>
conditions that are readily apparent to those skilled in the art: as a<br>
homogeneous liquid phase reaction in the presence or absence of an inert<br>
hydrocarbon diluent such as toluene or heptanes; as a two-phase<br>
liquid/liquid reaction; as a slurry process where the catalyst is in a form<br>
that displays little or no solubility; as a bulk process in which essentially<br>
neat reactant and/or product olefins serve as the dominant medium; as a<br>
gas-phase process in which at least a portion of the reactant or product<br>
olefin(s) are transported to or from a supported form of the catalyst via the<br>
gaseous state. Evaporative cooling from one or more monomers or inert<br>
volatile liquids is but one method that can be employed to effect the<br>
removal of heat from the reaction. The reactions may be performed in the<br>
known types of gas-phase reactors, such as circulating bed, vertically or<br>
 <br>
horizontally stirred-bed, fixed-bed, or fluidized-bed reactors, liquid-phase<br>
reactors, such as plug-flow, continuously stirred tank, or loop reactors, or<br>
combinations thereof. A wide range of methods for effecting product,<br>
reactant, and catalyst separation and/or purification are known to those<br>
skilled in the art and may be employed: distillation, filtration, liquid-liquid<br>
separation, slurry settling, extraction, etc. One or more of these methods<br>
may be performed separately from the oligomerization reaction or it may<br>
be advantageous to integrate at least some with the reaction; a non-<br>
limiting example of this would be a process employing catalytic (or<br>
reactive) distillation. Also advantageous may be a process which includes<br>
more than one reactor, a catalyst kill system between reactors or after the<br>
final reactor, or an integrated reactor/separator/purifier. While all catalyst<br>
components, reactants, inerts, and products could be employed in the<br>
present invention on a once-through basis, it is often economically<br>
advantageous to recycle one or more of these materials; in the case of the<br>
catalyst system, this might require reconstituting one or more of the<br>
catalysts components to achieve the active catalyst system. It is within the<br>
scope of this invention that an oligomerization product might also serve as<br>
a solvent or diluent. Mixtures of inert diluents or solvents also could be<br>
employed. The preferred diluents or solvents are aliphatic and aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons such as, for example,<br>
isobutane, pentane, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene, mesitylene,<br>
heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, 1-hexene, 1-octene,<br>
chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and the like, and mixtures such as<br>
Isopar™.<br>
Techniques for varying the distribution of products from the<br>
oligomerization reactions include controlling process conditions (e.g.<br>
concentration of components (i)-(iii), reaction temperature, pressure,<br>
residence time) and properly selecting the design of the process and are<br>
well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The ethylene feedstock for the oligomerization may be substantially<br>
pure or may contain other olefinic impurities and/or ethane. One<br>
 <br>
embodiment of the process of the invention comprises the oligomerization<br>
of ethylene-containing waste streams from other chemical processes or a<br>
crude ethylene/ethane mixture from a cracker.<br>
In a highly preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
oligomerization product produced from this invention is added to a product<br>
stream from another alpha olefins manufacturing process for separation<br>
into different alpha olefins. As previously discussed, "conventional alpha<br>
olefin plants" (wherein the term includes i) those processes which produce<br>
alpha olefins by a chain growth process using an aluminum alkyl catalyst,<br>
ii) the aforementioned "SHOP" process and iii) the production of olefins<br>
from synthesis gas using the so called Lurgi process) have a series of<br>
distillation columns to separate the "crude alpha product" (i.e. a mixture of<br>
alpha olefins) into alpha olefins (such as butene-1, hexene-1 and octene-<br>
1). The mixed hexene-octene product which is produced in accordance<br>
with the present invention is highly suitable for addition/mixing with a crude<br>
alpha olefin product from an existing alpha olefin plant (or a "cut" or<br>
fraction of the product from such a plant) because the mixed hexene-<br>
octene product produced in accordance with the present invention can<br>
have very low levels of internal olefins. Thus, the hexene-octene product<br>
of the present invention can be readily separated in the existing distillation<br>
columns of alpha olefin plants (without causing the large burden on the<br>
operation of these distillation columns which would otherwise exist if the<br>
present hexene-octene product stream contained large quantities of<br>
internal olefins). As used herein, the term "liquid product" is meant to refer<br>
to the oligomers produced by the process of the present invention which<br>
have from 4 to (about) 20 carbon atoms.<br>
The liquid product from the oligomerization process of the present<br>
invention preferably consists of from 20 to 80 weight% octenes (especially<br>
from 35 to 75 weight%) octenes and from 15 to 50 weight% (especially<br>
from 20 to 40 weight%) hexenes (where all of the weight% are calculated<br>
on the basis of the liquid product by 100%.<br>
 <br>
The preferred oligomerization process of this invention is also<br>
characterized by producing very low levels of internal olefins (i.e. low<br>
levels of hexene-2, hexene-3, octene-2, octene-3 etc.), with preferred<br>
levels of less than 10 weight% (especially less than 5 weight%) of the<br>
hexenes and octenes being internal olefins.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention encompasses the use of<br>
components (i) (ii) and (iii) in conjunction with one or more types of olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst system (iv) to trimerise ethylene and subsequently<br>
incorporate a portion of the trimerisation product(s) into a higher polymer.<br>
Component (iv) may be one or more suitable polymerization<br>
catalyst system(s), examples of which include, but are not limited to,<br>
conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts, metallocene catalysts,<br>
monocyclopentadienyl or "constrained geometry" catalysts, phosphinimine<br>
catalysts, heat activated supported chromium oxide catalysts (e.g.<br>
"Phillips"-type catalysts), late transition metal polymerization catalysts (eg.<br>
diimine, diphosphine and salicylaldimine nickel/palladium catalysts, iron<br>
and cobalt pyridyldiimine catalysts and the like) and other so-called "single<br>
site catalysts" (SSC's).<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalysts, in general, consist of two main components.<br>
One component is an alkyl or hydride of a Group I to III metal, most<br>
commonly AI(Et)3 or AI(iBu)3 or AI(Et)2CI but also encompassing Grignard<br>
reagents, n-butyllithium, or dialkylzinc compounds. The second<br>
component is a salt of a Group IV to VIII transition metal, most commonly<br>
halides of titanium or vanadium such as TiCl4, TiCl3, VCI4, or VOCI3. The<br>
catalyst components when mixed, usually in a hydrocarbon solvent, may<br>
form a homogeneous or heterogeneous product. Such catalysts may be<br>
impregnated on a support, if desired, by means known to those skilled in<br>
the art and so used in any of the major processes known for co-ordination<br>
catalysis of polyolefins such as solution, slurry, and gas-phase. In addition<br>
to the two major components described above, amounts of other<br>
compounds (typically electron donors) maybe added to further modify the<br>
polymerization behaviour or activity of the catalyst.<br>
 <br>
Metallocene catalysts, in general, consist of transition metal<br>
complexes, most commonly based on Group IV metals, ligated with<br>
cyclopentadienyl(Cp)-type groups. A wide range of structures of this type<br>
of catalysts is known, including those with substituted, linked and/or<br>
heteroatom-containing Cp groups, Cp groups fused to other ring systems<br>
and the like. Additional activators, such as boranes or alumoxane, are<br>
often used and the catalysts may be supported, if desired.<br>
Monocyclopentadienyl or "constrained geometry" catalysts, in<br>
general, consist of a transition metal complexes, most commonly based on<br>
Group IV metals, ligated with one cyclopentadienyl(Cp)-type group, often<br>
linked to additional donor group. A wide range of structures of this type of<br>
catalyst is known, including those with substituted, linked and/or<br>
heteroatom-containing Cp groups, Cp groups fused to other ring systems<br>
and a range of linked and non-linked additional donor groups such as<br>
amides, amines and alkoxides. Additional activators, such as boranes or<br>
alumoxane, are often used and the catalysts may be supported, if desired.<br>
A typical heat activated chromium oxide (Phillips) type catalyst<br>
employs a combination of a support material to which has first been added<br>
a chromium-containing material wherein at least part of the chromium is in<br>
the hexavalent state by heating in the presence of molecular oxygen. The<br>
support is generally composed of about 80 to 100 wt. % silica, the<br>
remainder, if any, being selected from the group consisting of refractory<br>
metal oxides, such as aluminium, boria, magnesia, thoria, zirconia, titania<br>
and mixtures of two or more of these refractory metal oxides. Supports<br>
can also comprise alumina, aluminium phosphate, boron phosphate and<br>
mixtures thereof with each other or with silica. The chromium compound<br>
is typically added to the support as a chromium (III) compound such as the<br>
acetate or acetylacetonate in order to avoid the toxicity of chromium (VI).<br>
The raw catalyst is then calcined in air at a temperature between 250 and<br>
1000° C. for a period of from a few seconds to several hours. This<br>
converts at least part of the chromium to the hexavalent state. Reduction<br>
of the Cr (VI) to its active form normally occurs in the polymerization<br>
 <br>
reaction, but can be done at the end of the calcination cycle with CO at<br>
about 350° C. Additional compounds, such as fluorine, aluminium and/or<br>
titanium may be added to the raw Phillips catalyst to modify it.<br>
Late transition metal and single site catalysts cover a wide range of<br>
catalyst structures based on metals across the transition series.<br>
Component (iv) may also comprise one or more polymerization<br>
catalysts or catalyst systems together with one or more additional<br>
oligomerization catalysts or catalyst systems. Suitable oligomerization<br>
catalysts include, but are not limited to, those that dimerise (for example,<br>
nickel phosphine dimerisation catalysts) or trimerise olefins or otherwise<br>
oligomerize olefins to, for example, a broader distribution of 1-olefins (for<br>
example, iron and cobalt pyridyldiimine oligomerization catalysts).<br>
Component (iv) may independently be supported or unsupported.<br>
Where components (i) and (ii) and optionally (iii) are supported, (iv) may<br>
be co-supported sequentially in any order or simultaneously on the same<br>
support or may be on a separate support. For some combinations, the<br>
components (i) (iii) may be part or all of component (iv). For example, if<br>
component (iv) is a heat activated chromium oxide catalyst then this may<br>
be (i), a chromium source and if component (iv) contains an alumoxane<br>
activator then this may also be the optional activator (iii).<br>
The components (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) may be in essentially any molar<br>
ratio that produces a polymer product. The precise ratio required depends<br>
on the relative reactivity of the components and also on the desired<br>
properties of the product or catalyst systems.<br>
An "in series" process could be conducted by first conducting the<br>
oligomerization reaction, then passing the oligomerization product to a<br>
polymerization reaction. In the case of an "in series" process various<br>
purification, analysis and control steps for the oligomeric product could<br>
potentially be incorporated between the trimerization and subsequent<br>
reaction stages. Recycling between reactors configured in series is also<br>
possible. An example of such a process would be the oligomerization of<br>
ethylene in a single reactor with a catalyst comprising components (i)-(iii)<br>
 <br>
followed by co-polymerization of the oligomerization product with ethylene<br>
in a separate, linked reactor to give branched polyethylene. Another<br>
example would be the oligomerization of an ethylene-containing waste<br>
stream from a polyethylene process, followed by introduction of the<br>
oligomerization product back into the polyethylene process as a co-<br>
monomer for the production of branched polyethylene.<br>
An example of an "in situ" process is the production of branched<br>
polyethylene catalyzed by components (i)-(iv), added in any order such<br>
that the active catalytic species derived from components (i)-(iii) are at<br>
some point present in a reactor with component (iv).<br>
Both the "in series and "in situ" approaches can be adaptions of<br>
current polymerization technology for the process stages including<br>
component (iv). All major olefin existing polymerization processes,<br>
including multiple reactor processes, are considered adaptable to this<br>
approach. One adaption is the incorporation of an oligomerization catalyst<br>
bed into a recycle loop of a gas phase polymerization process, this could<br>
be as a side or recycle stream within the main fluidization recycle loop and<br>
or within the degassing recovery and recycle system.<br>
Polymerization conditions when component (iv) is present can be,<br>
for example, solution phase, slurry phase, gas phase or bulk phase, with<br>
temperatures ranging from -100° C. to +300° C, and at pressures of<br>
atmospheric and above, particularly from 1.5 to 50 atmospheres. Reaction<br>
conditions, will typically have a significant impact upon the properties (e.g.<br>
density, melt index, yield) of the polymer being made and it is likely that<br>
the polymer requirements will dictate many of the reaction variables.<br>
Reaction temperature, particularly in processes where it is important to<br>
operate below the sintering temperature of the polymer, will typically, and<br>
preferably, be primarily selected to optimize the polymerization reaction<br>
conditions. Also, polymerization or copolymerization can be carried out in<br>
the presence of additives to control polymer or copolymer molecular<br>
weights. The use of hydrogen gas as a means of controlling the average<br>
 <br>
molecular weight of the polymer or copolymer applies generally to the<br>
polymerization process of the present invention.<br>
Slurry phase polymerization conditions or gas phase polymerization<br>
conditions are particularly useful for the production of high or low density<br>
grades of polyethylene, and polypropylene. In these processes the<br>
polymerization conditions can be batch, continuous or semi-continuous.<br>
Furthermore, one or more reactors may be used, e.g. from two to five<br>
reactors in series. Different reaction conditions, such as different<br>
temperatures or hydrogen concentrations may be employed in the different<br>
reactors.<br>
Once the polymer product is discharged from the reactor, any<br>
associated and absorbed hydrocarbons are substantially removed, or<br>
degassed, from the polymer by, for example, pressure let-down or gas<br>
purging using fresh or recycled steam, nitrogen or light hydrocarbons<br>
(such as ethylene). Recovered.gaseous or liquid hydrocarbons may be<br>
recycled to a purification system or the polymerization zone.<br>
In the slurry phase polymerization process the polymerization<br>
diluent is compatible with the polymer(s) and catalysts, and may be an<br>
alkane such as hexane, heptane, isobutane, or a mixture of hydrocarbons<br>
or paraffins. The polymerization zone can be, for example, an autoclave<br>
or similar reaction vessel, or a continuous liquid full loop reactor, e.g. of<br>
the type well-known in the manufacture of polyethylene by the Phillips<br>
Process. When the polymerization process of the present invention is<br>
carried out under slurry conditions the polymerization is preferably carried<br>
out at a temperature above 0 ° C, most preferably above 15° C. Under<br>
slurry conditions the polymerization temperature is preferably maintained<br>
below the temperature at which the polymer commences to soften or sinter<br>
in the presence of the polymerization diluent. If the temperature is allowed<br>
to go above the latter temperature, fouling of the reactor can occur.<br>
Adjustment of the polymerization within these defined temperature ranges<br>
can provide a useful means of controlling the average molecular weight of<br>
the produced polymer. A further useful means of controlling the molecular<br>
 <br>
weight is to conduct the polymerization in the presence of hydrogen gas<br>
which acts as chain transfer agent. Generally, the higher the<br>
concentration of hydrogen employed, the lower the average molecular<br>
weight of the produced polymer.<br>
In bulk polymerization processes, liquid monomer such as<br>
propylene is used as the polymerization medium.<br>
Methods for operating gas phase polymerization processes are well<br>
known in the art. Such methods generally involve agitating (e.g. by<br>
stirring, vibrating or fluidizing) a bed of catalyst, or a bed of the target<br>
polymer (i.e. polymer having the same or similar physical properties to that<br>
which it is desired to make in the polymerization process) containing a<br>
catalyst, and feeding thereto a stream of monomer (under conditions such<br>
that at least part of the monomer polymerizes in contact with the catalyst in<br>
the bed. The bed is generally cooled by the addition of cool gas (e.g.<br>
recycled gaseous monomer) and/or volatile liquid (e.g. a volatile inert<br>
hydrocarbon, or gaseous monomer which has been condensed to form a<br>
liquid). The polymer produced in, and isolated from, gas phase processes<br>
forms directly a solid in the polymerization zone and is free from, or<br>
substantially free from liquid. As is well known to those skilled in the art, if<br>
any liquid is allowed to enter the polymerization zone of a gas phase<br>
polymerization process the quantity of liquid in the polymerization zone is<br>
small in relation to the quantity of polymer present. This is in contrast to<br>
"solution phase" processes wherein the polymer is formed dissolved in a<br>
solvent, and "slurry phase" processes wherein the polymer forms as a<br>
suspension in a liquid diluent.<br>
The gas phase process can be operated under batch, semi-batch,<br>
or so-called "continuous" conditions. It is preferred to operate under<br>
conditions such that monomer is continuously recycled to an agitated<br>
polymerization zone containing polymerization catalyst, make-up monomer<br>
being provided to replace polymerized monomer, and continuously or<br>
intermittently withdrawing produced polymer from the polymerization zone<br>
at a rate comparable to the rate of formation of the polymer, fresh catalyst<br>
 <br>
being added to the polymerization zone to replace the catalyst withdrawn<br>
from the polymerization zone with the produced polymer.<br>
Methods for operating gas phase fluidized bed processes for<br>
making polyethylene, ethylene copolymers and polypropylene are well<br>
known in the art. The process can be operated, for example, in a vertical<br>
cylindrical reactor equipped with a perforated distribution plate to support<br>
the bed and to distribute the incoming fluidizing gas stream through the<br>
bed. The fluidizing gas circulating through the bed serves to remove the<br>
heat of polymerization from the bed and to supply monomer for<br>
polymerization in the bed. Thus the fluidizing gas generally comprises the<br>
monomer(s) normally together with some inert gas (e.g. nitrogen or inert<br>
hydrocarbons such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane or<br>
hexane) and optionally with hydrogen as molecular weight modifier. The<br>
hot fluidizing gas emerging from the top of the bed is led optionally through<br>
a velocity reduction zone (this can be a cylindrical portion of the reactor<br>
having a wider diameter) and, if desired, a cyclone and or filters to<br>
disentrain fine solid particles from the gas stream. The hot gas is then led<br>
to a heat exchanger to remove at least part of the heat of polymerization.<br>
Catalysts are preferably fed continuously or at regular internals to the bed.<br>
At start up of the process, the bed comprises fluidizable polymer which is<br>
preferably similar to the target polymer. Polymer is produced continuously<br>
within the bed by the polymerization of the monomer(s). Preferably means<br>
are provided to discharge polymer from the bed continuously or at regular<br>
internals to maintain the fluidized bed at the desired height. The process<br>
is generally operated at relatively low pressure, for example, at 10 to 50<br>
atmospheres, and at temperatures for example, between 50 and 135° C.<br>
The temperature of the bed is maintained below the sintering temperature<br>
of the fluidized polymer to avoid problems of agglomeration.<br>
In the gas phase fluidized bed process for polymerization of olefins<br>
the heat evolved by the exothermic polymerization reaction is normally<br>
removed from the polymerization zone (i.e. the fluidized bed) by means of<br>
the fluidizing gas stream as described above. The hot reactor gas<br>
 <br>
emerging from the top of the bed is led through one or more heat<br>
exchangers wherein the gas is cooled. The cooled reactor gas, together<br>
with any make-up gas, is then recycled to the base of the bed. In the gas<br>
phase fluidized bed polymerization process of the present invention it is<br>
desirable to provide additional cooling of the bed (and thereby improve the<br>
space time yield of the process) by feeding a volatile liquid to the bed<br>
under conditions such that the liquid evaporates in the bed thereby<br>
absorbing additional heat of polymerization from the bed by the "latent<br>
heat of evaporation" effect. When the hot recycle gas from the bed enters<br>
the beat exchanger, the volatile liquid can condense out. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention the volatile liquid is separated from<br>
the recycle gas and reintroduced separately into the bed. Thus, for<br>
example, the volatile liquid can be separated and sprayed into the bed. In<br>
another embodiment of the present invention the volatile liquid is recycled<br>
to the bed with the recycle gas. Thus the volatile liquid can be condensed<br>
from the fluidizing gas stream emerging from the reactor and can be<br>
recycled to the bed with recycle gas, or can be separated from the recycle<br>
gas and then returned to the bed.<br>
A number of process options can be envisaged when using the<br>
catalysts of the present invention in an integrated process to prepare<br>
higher polymers i.e. when component (iv) is present. These options<br>
include "in series" processes in which the oligomerization and subsequent<br>
polymerization are carried in separate but linked reactors and "in situ"<br>
processes in which a both reaction steps are carried out in the same<br>
reactor.<br>
In the case of a gas phase "in situ" polymerization process,<br>
component (iv) can, for example, be introduced into the polymerization<br>
reaction zone in liquid form, for example, as a solution in a substantially<br>
inert liquid diluent. Components (i)-(iv) may be independently added to any<br>
part of the polymerization reactor simultaneously or sequentially together<br>
or separately. Under these circumstances it is preferred the liquid<br>
containing the component(s) is sprayed as fine droplets into the<br>
 <br>
polymerization zone. The droplet diameter is preferably within the range 1<br>
to 1000 microns.<br>
Although not usually required, upon completion of polymerization or<br>
copolymerization, or when it is desired to terminate polymerization or<br>
copolymerization or at least temporarily deactivate the catalyst or catalyst<br>
component of this invention, the catalyst can be contacted with water,<br>
alcohols, acetone, or other suitable catalyst deactivators a manner known<br>
to persons of skill in the art.<br>
A range of polyethylene polymers are considered accessible<br>
including high density polyethylene, medium density polyethylene, low<br>
density polyethylene, ultra low density polyethylene and elastomeric<br>
materials. Particularly important are the polymers having a density in the<br>
range of 0.91 to 0.93, grams per cubic centimeter (g/cc) generally referred<br>
to in the art as linear low density polyethylene. Such polymers and<br>
copolymers are used extensively in the manufacture of flexible blown or<br>
cast film.<br>
Depending upon the use of the polymer product, minor amounts of<br>
additives are typically incorporated into the polymer formulation such as<br>
acid scavengers, antioxidants, stabilizers, and the like. Generally, these<br>
additives are incorporated at levels of about 25 to 2000 parts per million by<br>
weight (ppm), typically from about 50 to about 1000 ppm, and more<br>
typically 400 to 1000 ppm, based on the polymer. In use, polymers or<br>
copolymers made according to the invention in the form of a powder are<br>
conventionally compounded into pellets. Examples of uses for polymer<br>
compositions made according to the invention include use to form fibres,<br>
extruded films, tapes, spunbonded webs, molded or thermoformed<br>
products, and the like. The polymers may be blown or cast into films, or<br>
may be used for making a variety of molded or extruded articles such as<br>
pipes, and containers such as bottles or drums. Specific additive<br>
packages for each application may be selected as known in the art.<br>
Examples of supplemental additives include slip agents, anti-blocks, anti-<br>
stats, mould release agents, primary and secondary anti-oxidants,<br>
 <br>
clarifiers, nucleants, uv stabilizers, and the like. Classes of additives are<br>
well known in the art and include phosphite antioxidants, hydroxylamine<br>
(such as N,N-dialkyl hydroxylamine) and amine oxide (such as dialkyl<br>
methyl amine oxide) antioxidants, hindered amine light (uv) stabilizers,<br>
phenolic stabilizers, benzofuranone stabilizers, and the like.<br>
Fillers such as silica, glass fibers, talc, and the like, nucleating<br>
agents, and colourants also may be added to the polymer compositions as<br>
known by the art.<br>

General<br>
All reactions involving air and or moisture sensitive compounds<br>
were conducted under nitrogen using standard Schlenk or cannula<br>
techniques, or in a glovebox. Reaction solvents were purified prior to use<br>
(e.g. by distillation) and stored over activated 4 A sieves. Diethylamine,<br>
 <br>
triethylamine and isopropylamine were purchased from Aldrich and dried<br>
over 4 Å molecular sieves prior to use. 1-Bromo-2-fluoro-benzene,<br>
phosphorus trichloride (PCI3), hydrogen chloride gas and n-butyllithium<br>
were purchased from Aldrich and used as is. The methalumoxane (MAO),<br>
10 wt% Al in toluene, was purchased from Akzo and used as is.<br>
Deuterated solvents were purchased (toluene-d8, THF-d8) and were stored<br>
over 4 A sieves. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 MHz<br>
spectrometer (300.1 MHz for 1H, 121.5 MHz for 31P, 282.4 for 19F).<br>
Preparation of Et2NPCI2<br>
Et2NH (50.00 mmol, 5.17 mL) was added dropwise to a solution of<br>
PCI3 (25.00 mmol, 2.18 mL) in diethyl ether (will use "ether" from here)<br>
(200 mL) at -78° C. After the addition, the cold bath was removed and the<br>

Preparation of (ortho-F-C6H4)PCI<br>
Anhydrous HCI(g) was introduced to the head space of an ethereal<br>
solution (100 mL) of (ortho-F-C6H4)P-NEt2 (3.73 g, 12.70 mmol) to a<br>
pressure of 3 psi. A white precipitate formed immediately. The reaction<br>
was stirred for an additional 0.5 hours at which point the slurry was<br>
pumped to dryness to remove volatiles. The residue was re-slurried in<br>
ether (100 mL) and filtered. The filtrate was pumped to dryness yielding<br>
(ortho-F-C6H4)2PCI as a colorless oil in quantitative yield. 1H NMR (δ,<br>

To a solution of (ortho-F-C6H4)PCI (1.00 g, 3.90 mmol) in ether (50<br>
mL) and NEt3 (3 mL) was added an ethereal solution of i-PrNH2 (0.42 mL,<br>
4.90 mmol) at -5 °C. Immediate precipitate was observed. The slurry was<br>
stirred for 3 hours and filtered. The filtrate was pumped to dryness to give<br>

Preparation of (ortho-F-C6H4)2PN(i-Pr)P(ortho-F-C6H4)2<br>
To a solution of (ortho-F-C6H4)2PNH(i-Pr) (3.90 mmol) [made from i-PrNH2<br>
and (ortho-F-C6H4)2PCI (1.00 g, 3.90 mmol)] in ether (100 mL) maintained<br>
at -70 °C was added dropwise a solution of n-BuLi (2.43 mL of 1.6 M n-<br>
BuLi hexane solution, 3.90 mmol)). The mixture was stirred at -70° C for 1<br>
hour and allowed to warm to -10°C in a cold bath (2 hours). The solution<br>
was re-cooled to -70° C and (ortho-F-C6H4)2PCI (1.00 g, 3.90 mmol) was<br>
slowly added. The solution was stirred for 1 hour at -70° C and allowed to<br>
slowly warm to room temperature forming a white precipitate. The slurry<br>
was pumped to dryness and the residue was extracted with toluene and<br>
filtered. The filtrate was pumped to dryness and recrystallized from<br>
heptane at -70° C (2x) yielding 1.13 g (58%) of product. At room<br>
 <br>
temperature this material was an oil which contained both the desired<br>
ligand (ortho-F-C6H4)2PN(i-Pr)P(ortho-F-C6H4)2 and its isomer (ortho-F-<br>
C6H4)2P[=N(i-Pr]P(ortho-F-C6H4)2. A toluene solution of this mixture and<br>
50 mg of {ortho-F-C6H4)2PCI was heated at 65 °C for three hours to<br>
convert the isomer to the desired ligand. 1H NMR (THF-d8, δ): 7.35 (m,<br>
8H), 7.10 (m, 4H), 6.96 (m, 4H), 3.94 (m, 1H), 1.24 (d, 6H, J = 7Hz). 19F<br>
NMR (THF-d8, δ): -104.2 (br. s).<br>
In a more preferred procedure the initial steps of the synthesis are<br>
conducted in pentane at -5° C (instead of ether) with 10% more of the<br>
(ortho-F-C6H4)2PCI (otherwise as described above). This preferred<br>
procedure allows (ortho-F-C6H4)2PN(i-Pr)P(ortho-F-C6H4)2 to be formed in<br>
high (essentially quantitative) yield without the final step of heating in<br>
toluene.<br>
(ortho-F-C6H4)2PN(i-Pr)P(ortho-F-C6H4)2 is a novel molecule and is<br>
claimed, per se, in claim 1.<br>
Oligomerization Reactions<br>
Example 1<br>
A 600-mL reactor fitted with a gas-entrained stirrer (1700 rpm) was<br>
purged 3 times with argon while heated at 50° C. The reactor was then<br>
cooled to 30° C and a solution of MAO (11.72 g, 10 wt% Al) in 57.31 g of<br>
toluene, followed by 86.7 g of toluene was transferred via a stainless steel<br>
cannula to the reactor. The reactor was then pressurized with ethylene<br>
(15 atmospheres (gauge)) and the temperature adjusted to 45° C. Bis(di-<br>
(ortho-fluorophenyl)phosphino)-/-propylamine (33.4 mg, 0.067 mmol) in<br>
8.69 g of toluene was added to chromium acetylacetonate (22.9 mg, 0.066<br>
mmol) in 8.68 g of toluene in a hypovial. The mixture was sonicated at<br>
ambient temperature for 1 minute and then transferred under ethylene to<br>
the pressurized reactor. Immediately after, additional ethylene was added<br>
to increase the reactor pressure to 20 atmospheres (gauge). The reaction<br>
was terminated after 12 minutes by stopping the flow of ethylene to the<br>
