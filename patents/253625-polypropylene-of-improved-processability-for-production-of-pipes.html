				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a polymer composition having improved<br>
processability for the preparation of pipes of high surface-smoothness and excellent<br>
mechanical properties. Furthermore, it relates to a process for preparing such a polymer composition and to pipes made therefrom.<br>
Pipes made of polymeric material are frequently used for various purposes such as<br>
fluid transport, i.e. transport of liquids and gases. The fluid may be pressurized, e.g.<br>
when transporting natural gas or tap water, or non-pressurized, e.g. when transporting<br>
sewage (waste-water), drainage, for storm water applications or indoor sewage (soil<br>
and waste discharge). Moreover, the transported fluid may have varying temperature,<br>
usually within the range of 0°C to 50°C. Pressureless (non-pressure) pipes may also<br>
be used for cable and pipe protection and for culvert system (e.g. road and rail).<br>
Polypropylene-based polymers have many characteristics which make them suitable<br>
for applications like pipes, fittings, moulded articles, foams. Polypropylene as a pipe<br>
material is mainly used in non-pressure applications (pipes and fittings) and profiles.<br>
However, polypropylene is also used for pressure pipes, mainly hot water and<br>
industrial pipes.<br>
For non-pressure pipe systems, high stiffness is needed to provide sufficient<br>
resistance, e.g. to soil pressure. Normally, polypropylene products of high stiffness<br>
are based on high molecular weight materials which are often nucleated by adding<br>
nucleating agents, i.e. crystallization starts at a higher temperature and crystallization<br>
speed is high.. However, in polymers of high molecular weight the tendency of<br>
polymeric chains to be oriented is more pronounced. As a consequence, these high<br>
molecular weight polymers will result in high process shrinkage since the oriented<br>
polymeric chains are striving to go back in the non-oriented stage when the melt is<br>
leaving the die or extruder die head. Since shrinkage normally increases with<br>
increasing extrusion speed, this poses a significant restriction to production rate.<br><br>
Furthermore, due to the tendency of high molecular weight polymers to be oriented,<br>
residual stress in the final product is increasing due to fast crystallization of the high<br>
modulus material if cooling is applied before the material has been able to recover<br>
after orientation in the melt, whereas surface properties such as surface smoothness<br>
are poor. However, surface properties of the final polymer are relevant for the notch<br>
resistance of the final product. Thus, pipe surfaces having imperfections and/or<br>
scratches result in very low notch resistance.<br>
To increase output rate of the extruder (e.g. for pipe production), a polymer of high<br>
flowability would be preferred. Furthermore, at a specific output rate, melt pressure<br>
and melt temperature at the end of the extruder should be on a low level but also<br>
sufficiently high to ensure a good melt homogeneity (e.g. normally above 190°C for<br>
polypropylene). When increasing the output of the extruder, the melt pressure and<br>
hence the melt temperature are increasing based on the flow restrictions, i.e. the die<br>
or die head. With regard to melt pressure, restrictions result from the extruder<br>
equipment whereas at high melt temperature polymer degradation is more likely to<br>
occur. For improving flowability, the polymeric melt should be of low viscosity, e.g.<br>
by reducing molecular weight. However, as discussed above, high molecular weight<br>
is preferred for realizing high stiffness. Furthermore, by using low viscosity material,<br>
the resulting mechanical properties are usually not sufficient for meeting the<br>
requirements as defined in international standards like EN 1852, prEN13476.<br>
Normally, melt flow rate values of polymers for non-pressure pipe applications are<br>
kept at a low level to fulfil the standard requirements.<br>
As discussed above, to realize a specific output rate a lower melt temperature would<br>
be preferred. However, a too low melt temperature normally results in worse surface<br>
properties, e.g. poor surface smoothness, and as a consequence thereof in worse<br>
mechanical properties, e.g. low notch resistance.<br>
Thus, there is still a need for polypropylene-based compositions for pipes having<br>
improved processability while maintaining mechanical properties on a high level.<br>
Considering the problems discussed above, it is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a polypropylene-based composition that can be processed at lower melt<br><br>
temperature and/or melt pressure but still results in a material of high stiffness,<br>
excellent surface properties like high surface smoothness, good long term properties,<br>
high notch resistance and high impact values at low temperature.<br>
These objects are solved by providing a polymer composition, comprising<br>
(i) a polypropylene-based matrix which comprises at least one polypropylene<br>
random copolymer prepared by copolymerization of propylene with an olefin<br>
comonomer, wherein the amount of olefin comonomer units within the matrix is from<br>
0.2 wt% to 5.0 wt%, based on the weight of the polypropylene-based matrix, and<br>
(ii) an elastomeric copolymer of propylene and at least one olefin comonomer,<br>
the polymer composition having a storage modulus G' at a loss modulus G"=5 kPa of<br>
G'(5 kPa) 
An essential feature of the invention is the presence of a polypropylene random<br>
copolymer, prepared by copolymerization of propylene with an olefin comonomer.<br>
As will be discussed below, the polypropylene-based matrix can be made of one<br>
polypropylene random copolymer only or can optionally comprise further polymeric<br>
components such as a polypropylene homopolymer or a second polypropylene<br>
random copolymer.<br>
According to the present invention, the polypropylene-based matrix needs to have an<br>
amount of olefin comonomer units originating from the one or more random<br>
copolymer components within the range of 0.2 wt% to 5.0 wt%.<br>
As already indicated above, a random copolymer is one of the three main types of<br>
polypropylene. In general, a polypropylene random copolymer is obtained when<br>
propylene is polymerized with at least one comonomer so as to result in a random or<br>
statistical distribution of the comonomer within the polymer chain. The amount and<br>
type of comonomer has a significant influence on a number of properties like<br>
crystallization behaviour, stiffness, melting point or flowability of the polymer melt.<br>
To solve the objects of the present invention, in particular to provide an improved<br>
balance between processability and mechanical properties, it is necessary to keep the<br><br>
amount of olefin comonomer units originating from the polypropylene random<br>
copolymer within the range given above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypropylene-based matrix has an amount of olefin<br>
comonomer units within the range of 0.2 wt% to 4.0 wt%. In other preferred<br>
embodiments, the amount of olefin comonomer units within the matrix is from 0.5<br>
wt% to 3.0 wt%, from 0.5 wt% to 2.0 wt%, or from 0.5 wt% to 1.5 wt%.<br>
The olefin comonomer is preferably selected from ethylene, C4 to C10 alpha-olefins<br>
such as 1-butene, 1-hexene or 1-octene, or mixtures thereof. Ethylene is the preferred<br>
comonomer.<br>
When ethylene is used as the olefin comonomer, its amount within the<br>
polypropylene-based matrix is preferably within the range of 0.2 to 5.0 wt%, more<br>
preferably 0.2 wt% to 4.0 wt%, even more preferably 0.4 wt% to 3.0 wt%, and most<br>
preferably 0.6 wt% to 2.0 wt%.<br>
In case the matrix is made of the polypropylene random copolymer only, the ranges<br>
given above correspond to the amount of comonomer units within the random<br>
copolymer. However, if further components are present in the polypropylene-based<br>
matrix, the random copolymer can have an amount of olefin comonomer units<br>
exceeding the ranges given above.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypropylene-based matrix is unimodal. In such a<br>
case, the matrix is preferably made of the polypropylene random copolymer only.<br>
However, it might also comprise one or more additional polymeric components<br>
having a molecular weight adapted to the molecular weight of the random copolymer<br>
so as to maintain the unimodal molecular weight distribution.<br>
According to another preferred embodiment, the polypropylene-based matrix is<br>
multimodal, e.g. bimodal.<br>
The expression "multimodal" used herein refers to the modality of the polymer, i.e.<br>
the form of its molecular weight distribution curve, which is the graph of the<br>
molecular weight fraction as a function of its molecular weight. As will be explained<br>
below, the polymer components of the present invention can be produced in a<br><br>
sequential step process, using reactors in serial configuration and operating at<br>
different reaction conditions. As a consequence, each fraction prepared in a specific<br>
reactor will have its own molecular weight distribution. When the molecular weight<br>
distribution curves from these fractions are superimposed to obtain the molecular<br>
weight distribution curve of the final polymer, that curve may show two or more<br>
maxima or at least be distinctly broadened when compared with curves for the<br>
individual fractions. Such a polymer, produced in two or more serial steps, is called<br>
bimodal or multimodal, depending on the number of steps.<br>
As already indicated above, the polypropylene-based matrix can comprise further<br>
polymeric components, in particular for obtaining a multimodal matrix.<br>
Preferably, the polypropylene-based matrix further comprises a polypropylene<br>
homopolymer. Within the context of the present invention, a polypropylene<br>
homopolymer is defined to be a polymer consisting of more than 99.8 wt%,<br>
preferably more than 99.9 wt%, even more preferably 99.99 wt% of propylene units.<br>
If units other than propylene units are present, these originate preferably from an<br>
olefin such as ethylene.<br>
The polypropylene homopolymer can be unimodal or multimodal.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypropylene homopolymer fraction has a melt flow<br>
rate MFR2.16kg/230°c of less than 20 g/10 min. In general, melt flow rate is related to<br>
flowability of the polymeric melt at a specific temperature when subjected to a<br>
specific load. High melt flow rate values indicate a polymeric melt of low viscosity,<br>
and vice versa.<br>
As will be explained below in greater detail, if a polypropylene homopolymer is<br>
present, it can be prepared in a first step, i.e. before preparing the polypropylene<br>
random copolymer and the elastomeric copolymer, or at a later stage. If prepared in a<br>
later stage, the homopolymer can be reactor-blended with the random copolymer<br>
already prepared before, thereby resulting in a matrix from which only a total melt<br>
flow rate can be determined but not the melt flow rate of each component within the<br>
blend. However, even if obtained as a reactor blend, the MFR2.16kg/230°c of the<br><br>
polypropylene homopolymer refers to a pure homopolymer fraction. In other words,<br>
it is the melt flow rate value of the polypropylene homopolymer that would have been<br>
obtained if polymerized without the presence of further components.<br>
In other preferred embodiments, the polypropylene homopolymer fraction has a melt<br>
flow rate MFR2.16kg/230°c of less than 10 g/10 min, less than 5 g/10 min or even less<br>
than 3 g/10 min.<br>
Preferably, the average molecular weight of the polypropylene random copolymer is<br>
higher than the average molecular weight of the polypropylene homopolymer, if<br>
present.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the polypropylene-based matrix comprises a<br>
second polypropylene random copolymer fraction, either as an alternative to the<br>
polypropylene homopolymer or in addition to the homopolymer, wherein both<br>
random copolymers differ in their amount of olefin comonomer units. Of course, the<br>
amount of olefin comonomer units of each polypropylene random copolymer fraction<br>
has to be chosen so as to result in a polypropylene-based matrix with an olefin<br>
comonomer content of 0.2 to 5 wt%.<br>
A further essential feature of the polymer composition of the present invention is the<br>
presence of an elastomeric copolymer of propylene and at least one olefin<br>
comonomer. The presence of such an elastomeric propylene copolymer improves<br>
impact performance of the final polymer. The conditions for the copolymerization are<br>
within the limits of conventional conditions for ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM)<br>
production. Typical conditions are disclosed e.g. in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science<br>
and Engineering, second edition, vol. 6, p. 545-558. An elastomeric product is<br>
obtained when the comonomer content of the polymer is within a certain range.<br>
Suitable olefin comonomers to be copolymerized with propylene can be selected<br>
from ethylene, C4 to C10 alpha-olefins such as 1-butene, 1-hexene or 1-octene, or<br>
mixtures thereof. Preferably, ethylene is used.<br><br>
Preferably, the elastomeric copolymer contains olefin comonomer units in an amount<br>
of 10 to 70 wt%, more preferably 20 to 50 wt%, based on the weight of the<br>
elastomeric copolymer.<br>
When ethylene is used as an olefin comonomer, the elastomeric copolymer preferably<br>
contains ethylene units in an amount of 10 to 70 wt%, based on the weight of the<br>
elastomeric copolymer. In other preferred embodiments, the amount of ethylene units<br>
within the elastomeric copolymer is from 10 wt% to 60 wt%, from 20 wt% to 55<br>
wt%, from 25 wt% to 50 wt%, or from 30 wt% to 50 wt%.<br>
As indicated above, the presence of an elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer<br>
improves impact properties as determined e.g. by measurement of Charpy notched<br>
impact strength. However, if the amount of elastomeric copolymer within the final<br>
polymer composition is too high, this might have a detrimental effect on other<br>
properties like stiffness or processability.<br>
Preferably, the polymer composition of the present invention comprises an amount of<br>
elastomeric copolymer within the range of 5 wt% to 30 wt%, based on the weight of<br>
the polymer composition. In other preferred embodiments, the amount of elastomeric<br>
copolymer within the final polymer composition is from 7 wt% to 20 wt% or from 10<br>
wt%to 15wt%.<br>
According to a further essential feature of the present invention, the polymer<br>
composition has a storage modulus G' at a loss modulus G"=5 kPa, of G(5kPa)
Pa, measured at 220°C. With a storage modulus of 3100 Pa or less, process shrinkage,<br>
residual stress, surface smoothness and notch resistance as well as impact strength<br>
can be further improved. This is insofar surprising as a reduction in melt elasticity<br>
(i.e. storage modulus) normally has a detrimental effect on notch resistance and<br>
impact strength, in particular at low temperature.<br>
The storage modulus G' is related to the molecular weight distribution. In general,<br>
storage modulus values increase with increasing molecular weight. However, G' is<br>
also highly dependent on the shape of the molecular weight distribution curve. In<br><br>
particular, it is a measure of the high molecular weight end of the molecular weight<br>
distribution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymer composition has a storage modulus G' at a<br>
loss modulus G" of 5 kPa, of G'(5kPa)
even more preferably 2500 Pa or less, and most preferably 2300 Pa or less, measured<br>
at 220°C.<br>
To have a material of high stiffness, the polymer composition preferably has a tensile<br>
modulus of at least 1350 MPa. In further preferred embodiments, the polymer<br>
composition of the present invention has a tensile modulus of at least 1400 MPa, at<br>
least 1475 MPa, at least 1500 MPa or at least 1600 MPa.<br>
In the so-called Rheotens test, a melt strand, e.g. generated by extrusion, is elongated<br>
by drawing down with a defined acceleration. The haul off force as a function of<br>
draw down velocity is recorded. The maximum values for haul off force and draw<br>
down velocity, i.e. Fmax and vmax, at failure of the strand indicate melt strength and<br>
drawability of the melt. Curves obtained by Rheotens tests of different polymers very<br>
sensitively reflect a change in molecular weight distribution, phase structure (e.g.<br>
degree of long chain branching) and crystallization speed. Further details about the<br>
Rheotens test in general can be found e.g. in EP-A-1301343.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymer composition has a ratio of drawabiiity vmax to<br>
melt strength Fmax of more than 2.1 mm/s*cN, measured according to the Rheotens<br>
test at an extrusion temperature of 200 °C. More preferably, the ratio of drawabiiity<br>
vmax to melt strength Fmax of the polymer composition in the Rheotens test is more<br>
than 2.5 mm/s*cN, even more preferably more than 2.7 mm/s*cN.<br>
With the Rheotens test, it is possible to characterize the ability of a material to<br>
efficiently fill a mould which is a very relevant property e.g. in the manufacturing<br>
process of single or double wall pipes (by vacuum and/or air pressure) before and<br>
during cooling and crystallization in the mould blocks. Thus, by having a low force<br>
combined with a good elongation ability, the mould filling will be fast and efficient,<br>
giving a good processability. It is also beneficial to have a low force in general as<br><br>
long as the elongation is sufficient for the filling of the mould, i.e. before the material<br>
crystallizes and will break as seen in the Rheotens test.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymer composition has a haul off force F of 60 cN<br>
or less at a velocity v = 80 mm/s in the Rheotens test at an extrusion temperature of<br>
200 °C. More preferably, the haul off force F at a velocity v = 80 mm/s is 50 cN or<br>
less, even more preferably 40 cN or less and most preferably 35 cN or less.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the polymer composition has a drawabiliy v of 40<br>
mm/s or more at a haul off force F = 20 cN in the Rheotens test at an extrusion<br>
temperature of 200 °C. More preferably, the drawability v at a haul off force F = 20<br>
cN is 50 mm/s or more, even more preferably 60 mm/s or more.<br>
To have a good balance between flowability of the melt and mechanical properties,<br>
the polymer composition preferably has a melt flow rate MFR2.16kg/230oc within the<br>
range of 0.2 to 10 g/10 min, more preferably 0.25 to 8 g/10 min, even more<br>
preferably 0.4 to 6.5 g/10 min, and most preferably 0.5 to 5 g/10 min.<br>
The polymer composition preferably has a polydispersity index PI, which is an<br>
indication of the breadth of the molecular weight distribution, of 2.5 to 6.0. In other<br>
preferred embodiments, PI of the matrix is within the range of 3.0 to 5.0, 3.0 to 4.5 or<br>
3.0 to 4.0. The polydispersity index PI is calculated according to the following<br>
equation:<br><br>
wherein Gc in Pa is the cross over modulus at which G,=G"=GC, G' and G" indicating<br>
the storage modulus and the loss modulus, respectively.<br>
The measurements have been done according to ISO 6421-10. Measurements were<br>
made at 220°C on a Physica MCR 300 rheometer with a plate-plate fixture, plate<br>
diameter 25 mm, and a distance between the plates of 1.8 mm.<br>
In addition to the components discussed above, the polymer composition may<br>
comprise conventional adjuvants, such as additives, fillers and reinforcing agents.<br><br>
As additives, the following can be mentioned: nucleating agents, process and heat<br>
stabilizers, pigments and other colouring agents including carbon black. Depending<br>
on the type of additive, these may be added in an amount of 0.01 to 5 wt%, based on<br>
the weight of the polymer composition.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymer composition includes 0.05 to 3 wt%, based<br>
on the weight of the polymer composition, of one or more alpha-nucleating agents<br>
such as talc, polymerized vinyl compounds such as polyvinyl cyclohexane,<br>
dibenzylidene sorbitol, sodium benzoate, and di(alkylbenzylidene)sorbitol. Except for<br>
talc, the alpha-nucleating agent is usually added in small amounts of 0.0001 to 1<br>
wt%, more preferably 0.001 to 0.7 wt%. Since talc can act both as a nucleating agent<br>
and as a filler, it can be added in higher amounts. When added as a nucleating agent,<br>
talc is preferably added in an amount of 0.05 to 3 wt%, more preferably 0.1 to 2 wt%,<br>
based on the weight of the polymer composition. Further details about these<br>
nucleating agents can be found e.g. in WO 99/24479 and WO 99/24501.<br>
The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of the polymer<br>
composition described above. The process of the present invention comprises the<br>
following steps in any sequence;<br>
(i) copolymerization of propylene with an olefin comonomer to result in a<br>
polypropylene random copolymer, and<br>
(ii) copolymerization of propylene with an olefin comonomer to result in an<br>
elastomeric copolymer.<br>
Since the polypropylene random copolymer is present in a higher amount, it is acting<br>
as a matrix into which the elastomeric copolymer is included to improve impact<br>
properties.<br>
Preferably, the reaction steps (i) and (ii) are carried out in at least one loop reactor<br>
and/or at least one gas phase reactor.<br>
It is preferred to have the sequence (i) -&gt; (ii).<br><br>
The amount and feed rate of olefin comonomer fed into the reactor for<br>
copolymerization with propylene are such that the polypropylene-based matrix has an<br>
amount of olefin comonomer units of 0.2 to 5 wt%, based on the weight of the<br>
matrix. Preferably, ethylene is used as the olefin comonomer.<br>
When the matrix is made of the random copolymer only, the amount of olefin<br>
comonomer units within the matrix corresponds to the amount of olefin comonomer<br>
units within the random copolymer. However, the matrix may include further<br>
polymeric components, as already discussed above.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the first reaction step is carried out in a loop<br>
reactor, this step optionally also comprising at least one gas phase reactor to which<br>
the product of the loop reactor is transferred to continue polymerization. Preferably,<br>
any reaction medium used and any non-reacted reagents are at least partly removed<br>
before transfer from the loop reactor to the gas phase reactor is performed.<br>
For the present invention, conventional loop and gas phase reactors which are<br>
commonly known in the relevant technical field can be used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, reaction conditions are chosen which result in a unimodal<br>
polypropylene random copolymer. Of course, when the polypropylene-based matrix<br>
is made of the random copolymer only, a unimodal matrix is obtained.<br>
However, within the present invention, it is also possible to effect polymerization of<br>
the random copolymer under conditions which result in a multimodal, e.g. bimodal<br>
polymer. This is preferably accomplished by using a loop reactor in serial<br>
configuration with one or more gas phase reactors.<br>
Preferably, the process of the present invention comprises an additional step (iii) for<br>
polypropylene homopolymerization. When using such a polypropylene<br>
homopolymerization step, the process steps are preferably carried out either in the<br>
sequence (i)-»(iii)-»(ii) or the sequence (iii)-&gt;(i)-&gt;(ii)<br>
If the polypropylene homopolymer is prepared first, reaction conditions are chosen so<br>
as to preferably have a MFR2.16kg/230°C of less than 20g/10 min for the homopolymer.<br><br>
By using a loop reactor and at least one gas phase reactor in serial configuration and<br>
working at different conditions, a multimodal (e.g. bimodal) polypropylene<br>
homopolymer can be obtained. However, within the context of the present invention,<br>
the polypropylene homopolymer can also be unimodal.<br>
As an alternative, the polypropylene random copolymer is prepared first. Again,<br>
polymerization can be effected by using a loop reactor only or a loop reactor in serial<br>
configuration with at least one gas phase reactor, the latter configuration resulting in a<br>
multimodal (e.g. bimodal) polypropylene random copolymer.<br>
Preferably, a loop reactor for preparing a polypropylene homopolymer or random<br>
copolymer is operated at a temperature of 50 °C to 100 °C and a pressure of 3000 kPa<br>
to 5500 kPa. In a preferred embodiment, at least one loop reactor is operated under<br>
supercritical conditions. As an example, supercritical conditions can include a<br>
temperature of at least 92°C and a pressure of at least 4600 kPa.<br>
Preferably, a gas phase reactor for preparing a polypropylene homopolymer or<br>
random copolymer is operated at a temperature of 50 °C to 110 °C and a pressure of<br>
1500 kPa to 4000 kPa.<br>
To further improve the balance between processability and mechanical properties of<br>
the polymer composition, a specific split between a first process step producing a first<br>
component and a second process step producing a second component can be chosen.<br>
The split indicates the weight ratio between different polymeric components prepared<br>
in different reaction steps.<br>
Preferably, the split between process step (i) and process step (ii), irrespective of their<br>
sequence, is from 95 : 5 to 70 : 30, more preferably from 95 : 5 to 80 : 20 and even<br>
more preferably from 95 : 5 to 85 : 15.<br>
When using a polypropylene homopolymerization step (iii), the split between the<br>
combined process steps (i) and (iii) and the process step (ii) is preferably from 95 : 5<br>
to 70 : 30, more preferably from 95 : 5 to 80 : 20 and even more preferably from 95 :<br>
5 to 85: 15.<br><br>
As a catalyst for the preparation of the polypropylene homopolymer and/or the<br>
polypropylene random copolymer, any stereo-specific catalyst for propylene<br>
polymerization can be used, which is capable of catalyzing polymerization and<br>
copolymerization of propylene and comonomers at a pressure of 500-10000<br>
kPa, in particular 2500-8000 kPa, and at a temperature of 40-110°C, in<br>
particular 60-110°C.<br>
Preferably, the catalyst comprises a high-yield Ziegler-Natta type catalyst<br>
which can be used at high polymerization temperatures of 80°C or more.<br>
Generally, the Ziegler-Natta catalyst used in the present invention comprises a<br>
catalyst component, a cocatalyst component, an external donor, the catalyst<br>
component of the catalyst system primarily containing magnesium, titanium,<br>
halogen and an internal donor. Electron donors control the sterospecific<br>
properties and/or improve the activity of the catalyst system. A number of<br>
electron donors including ethers, esters, polysilanes, polysiloxanes, and<br>
alkoxysilanes are known in the art.<br>
The catalyst preferably contains a transition metal compound as a procatalyst<br>
component. The transition metal compound is selected from the group<br>
consisting of titanium compounds having an oxidation degree of 3 or 4,<br>
vanadium compounds, zirconium compounds, cobalt compounds, nickel<br>
compounds, tungsten compounds and rare earth metal compounds, titanium<br>
trichloride and titanium tetrachloride being particularly preferred.<br>
It is preferred to use catalysts which can withstand the high temperatures<br>
prevailing in the loop reactor. The conventional Ziegler-Natta catalysts for<br>
isotactic polymerization of propylene generally have an operating temperature<br>
limit of around 80°C, above which they either become deactivated or lose their<br>
stereo-selectivity. This low polymerization temperature may put a practical<br>
limit on the heat removal efficiency of the loop reactor.<br>
One preferred catalyst to be used according to the invention is disclosed in EP<br>
591 224 which discloses a method for preparing a procatalyst composition from<br><br>
magnesium dichloride, a titanium compound, a lower alcohol and an ester of<br>
phthalic acid containing at least five carbon atoms. According to EP 591 224, a<br>
trans-esterification reaction is carried out at an elevated temperature between<br>
the lower alcohol and the phthalic acid ester, whereby the ester groups from the<br>
lower alcohol and the phthalic ester change places.<br>
Magnesium dichloride can be used as such or it can be combined with silica,<br>
e.g. by absorbing the silica with a solution or slurry containing magnesium<br>
dichloride. The lower alcohol used may preferably be methanol or ethanol,<br>
particularly ethanol.<br>
The titanium compound used in the preparation of the procatalyst is preferably<br>
an organic or inorganic titanium compound, which is at the oxidation state of 3<br>
or 4. Also other transition metal compounds, such as vanadium, zirconium,<br>
chromium, molybdenum and tungsten compounds can be mixed with the<br>
titanium compound. The titanium compound usually is a halide or oxyhalide, an<br>
organic metal halide, or a purely metal organic compound in which only<br>
organic ligands have been attached to the transition metal. Particularly<br>
preferred are the titanium halides, especially titanium tetrachloride.<br>
The alkoxy group of the phthalic acid ester used comprises at least five carbon<br>
atoms, preferably at least eight carbon atoms. Thus, as the ester may be used<br>
e.g. propylhexyl phthalate, dioctyl phthalate, di-isodecyl phthalate and<br>
ditridecyl phthalate. The molar ratio of phthalic acid ester and magnesium<br>
halide is preferably about 0.2:1.<br>
The transesterification can be carried out, e.g. by selecting a phthalic acid ester<br>
- a lower alcohol pair, which spontaneously or by the aid of a catalyst, which<br>
does not damage the procatalyst composition, transesterifies the catalyst at an<br>
elevated temperature. It is preferred to carry out the transesterification at a<br>
temperature which is 110-115°C, preferably 120-140°C.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Ziegler-Natta catalyst system can be modified<br>
by polymerizing in the presence of the catalyst a vinyl compound of the formula<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 together form a 5 or 6-membered saturated, unsaturated or<br>
aromatic ring or independently represent an alkyl group comprising 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms, and the modified catalyst is used for the preparation of the polymer<br>
composition. The polymerized vinyl compound can act as a nucleating agent. Further<br>
details about this modification are provided in EP 1 028 985.<br>
The catalyst prepared by the method above is used together with an<br>
organometallic cocatalyst and with an external donor. Generally, the external<br>
donor has the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R and R' can be the same or different and represent a linear, branched or cyclic<br>
aliphatic, or aromatic group;<br>
R" is methyl or ethyl;<br>
n is an integer of 0 to 3;<br>
m is an integer of 0 to 3; and<br>
n+m is 1 to 3.<br>
In particular, the external donor is selected from the group consisting of<br>
cyclohexyl methylmethoxy silane (CHMMS), dicyclopentyl dimethoxy silane<br>
(DCPDMS), diisopropyl dimethoxy silane, di-isobutyl dimethoxy silane, and<br>
di-t-butyl dimethoxy silane.<br>
An organoaluminium compound is used as a cocatalyst. The organoaluminium<br>
compound is preferably selected from the group consisting of trialkyl<br>
aluminium, dialkyl aluminium chloride and alkyl aluminium sesquichloride.<br>
According to the invention, such catalysts are typically introduced into the first<br>
reactor only. The components of the catalyst can be fed into the reactor<br><br>
separately or simultaneously or the components of the catalyst system can be<br>
precontacted prior to the reactor.<br>
Such precontacting can also include a catalyst prepolymerization prior to<br>
feeding into the polymerization reactor proper. In the prepolymerization, the<br>
catalyst components are contacted for a short period with a monomer before<br>
feeding to the reactor.<br>
As discussed above, in preferred embodiments the random copolymer and optionally<br>
the homopolymer are prepared first, whereas the elastomeric copolymer is prepared<br>
in a final step. Preferably, the elastomeric copolymer is prepared in a gas phase<br>
reactor. Optionally, two or more gas phase reactors can be used. The one or more gas<br>
phase reactors for the preparation of the elastomer can be in serial configuration with<br>
the reactors used for the preparation of the homopolymer and random copolymer.<br>
When using such a reactor configuration, the elastomeric copolymer is produced in<br>
the presence of the homopolymer/random copolymer matrix and dispersed therein.<br>
As an alternative, the elastomeric copolymer can be prepared separately and mixed<br>
with the polypropylene-based matrix at a later stage.<br>
In general, the conditions for the preparation of the elastomeric copolymer are within<br>
the limits of conventional conditions for ethylene-propylene rubber (EPM)<br>
production. Typical conditions are disclosed e.g. in Encyclopedia of Polymer Science<br>
and Engineering, second edition, vol. 6, p. 545-558. An elastomeric product is<br>
obtained when the comonomer content of the polymer is within a certain range.<br>
The catalytic system described above for the preparation of the polypropylene<br>
homopolymer and random copolymer can also be used for the preparation of the<br>
elastomeric copolymer.<br>
The present invention also provides a pipe and pipe fittings prepared from the<br>
polymer composition discussed above, e.g. by extrusion or injection moulding. The<br>
polymer composition can be used for pressure as well as non-pressure pipes.<br>
Preferably, it is used for non-pressure pipes.<br><br>
In particular, within the context of the present invention smooth solid wall pipes and<br>
structured wall pipes can be mentioned. Structured wall pipes include e.g. single layer<br>
corrugated pipes, ribbed pipes, twin wall pipes with hollow sections, multilayer pipes<br>
with or without hollow sections or foamed layers, and spirally wound pipes with or<br>
without hollow sections with smooth or corrugated pipe design.<br>
In general, pipes with thin sections, either smooth solid wall pipes of smaller<br>
diameter or structured wall pipes with thin sections are more sensitive to the<br>
formation of cracks. Furthermore, due to the three-dimensional structure of structured<br>
wall pipes, high local stress can be generated when subjected to external load<br>
conditions. However, pipes made of the polymer composition of the present invention<br>
have high notch resistance and high impact values at low temperature.<br>
The pipe of the present invention preferably has a resistance to accelerated crack<br>
growth in the notched pipe test according to ISO 13479 at 80°C and 4.2 MPa of at<br>
least 50 h, more preferably at least 90 h, even more preferably at least 130 h, and<br>
most preferably at least 200 h.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the pipe has a Charpy impact strength,<br>
measured according to ISO 179/leA at -20°C, of at least 3.0 kJ/m2, more preferably<br>
at least 4.0 kJ/m2, even more preferably at least 5.0 kJ/m2, and most preferably at<br>
least 6.0 kJ/m2.<br>
The present invention also provides an article having a surface roughness Rz,<br>
measured according to ISO 4287, of less than 18 µm, more preferably less than 14<br>
urn, even more preferably less than 10 µm, and most preferably less than 6 µm.<br>

Notched impact strength was determined according to ISO 179/leA at -20°C, based<br>
on compression-moulded samples.<br>

2. Materials<br>
Inventive examples 1 and 2 have been prepared using two loop reactors and one gas<br>
phase reactor. The polypropylene-based matrix comprises a polypropylene random<br>
copolymer in combination with a polypropylene homopolymer wherein the random<br>
copolymer is prepared first, followed by the preparation of the homopolymer.<br>
Ethylene was used as a comonomer for the random copolymer and the elastomer.<br>
In inventive examples 3 and 4, the polypropylene-based matrix was obtained by<br>
preparing a polypropylene random copolymer in a loop reactor, followed by<br>
preparing a polypropylene homopolymer in a first gas phase reactor. Subsequently,<br>
the elastomeric copolymer was produced in a second gas phase reactor. Ethylene was<br>
used as a comonomer for the random copolymer and the elastomer.<br>
In inventive examples 1, 2, 3 and 4, a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst was used which had<br>
been modified by transesterification and polymerization of a vinyl compound as<br>
described above.<br>
The reference materials were prepared using either one or two loop reactors and a<br>
gas, as shown in table 2. phase reactor. The reference materials have a pure<br>
polypropylene homopolymer matrix (i.e. no olefin comonomer units within the<br>
matrix) blended with an elastomeric ethylene-propylene copolymer. A Ziegler-Natta<br>
type catalyst was used. For Ref. 2, a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst was used which had<br>
been modified by transesterification and polymerization of a vinyl compound as<br>
described above. Ref. 1 and 2 were nucleated with 
Further details about the manufacturing processes are given in Tables 1-2.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The results demonstrate that high notch resistance and high impact strength can be<br>
obtained when the matrix has a low amount of olefin comonomer units within the<br>
range defined above and the storage modulus of the polymer composition is kept<br>
below 3100 Pa. Even at high MFR values, which improve processability, the notch<br>
resistance of the inventive materials is still on a high level (see Ex. 3 and in particular<br><br>
Ex. 4) whereas the reference material of high MFR value (see Ref. 3) has a very low<br>
notch resistance.<br><br>
