METHOD OF FORMING A HARDENED SKIN ON A SURFACE OF A MOLDED ARTICLE;<br>
VERTEX LLC., A CORPORATION ORGANISED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS, 15610 W. 100th TERRACE, LENEXA, KS 66219-1375, U.S.A.<br>
THE       FOLLOWING       SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY       DESCRIBES       THE INVENTION    AND    THE    MANNER    IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED. 1<br><br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is generally directed to the field of flow molding, and is more specifically directed to a unique flow molding process for forming a hardened skin on a surface of a molded article. Description of Related Art<br>
Various flow molding apparatuses are known in the art that employ dielectric heating to mold a plastic part from a formable plastic material. In all of these apparatuses, the plastic material is placed between two electrodes such that the material effectively becomes the dielectric of a capacitor. An alternating electric field generated between the electrodes causes polar molecules in the plastic material to be attracted and repelled by the rapidly changing polarity of the electric field. The friction resulting from this molecular movement causes the plastic material to heat throughout its entire mass to thereby form the molded article.<br>
One flow molding apparatus known in the art for making plastic parts comprises a top electrode and a bottom electrode with top and bottom molds disposed therebetween. The top and bottom molds define a molding cavity in which a plastic material may be placed. Preferably, the current field lines are perpendicular to the plastic material at all points along its surface to thereby provide a uniform temperature throughout the material. In addition, the top and bottom electrodes substantially match the configuration of the plastic part that is being fabricated such that the distance between the electrodes is constant in order to provide uniform heating of the plastic material. In operation, an alternating electric field is applied across the molding cavity to thereby form the plastic part. An example of this type of a flow molding apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,268,238.<br>
Another flow molding apparatus known in the art for making plastic parts comprises a top electrode and a bottom electrode with a mold disposed therebetween. The mold has a nonuniform thickness so as to allow the molding of a non-uniform plastic part from a plastic material placed between the mold and the top electrode. In order to provide uniform heating throughout the plastic material, a constant capacitance is maintained throughout all of the different thickness sections of the plastic part. This may be accomplished by equalizing the relative dielectric constants between the plastic material and the mold, preferably by altering the relative dielectric constant of the mold via the use of additives. Alternatively, the capacitance may be equalized by modifying the spacing between the top and bottom electrodes in the different thickness sections of the plastic part. An example of this type of a flow molding apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,441,876.<br>
1<br><br>
Another flow molding apparatus known in the art for making foamed plastic parts comprises a top electrode and a bottom electrode with a mold disposed therebetween. A plastic foam material may be placed in a cavity of the mold and then compressed during the heating cycle. After the heat is terminated, the compressed plastic foam material is permitted to expand as it cools so as to conform to the shape of the mold and thereby form the foamed plastic part. An example of this type of a flow molding apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,524,037.<br>
Yet another flow molding apparatus known in the art for making foamed plastic parts comprises a top electrode and a bottom electrode with a two-piece mold disposed therebetween. The mold supports a diaphragm such that a plastic foam material may be placed between the diaphragm and the bottom mold. A fluid is injected into the mold above the diaphragm so as to initially deflect the diaphragm and thus expel substantially all of the air from the mold. The fluid is then extracted from the mold during the heating cycle, which causes a vacuum in the mold to thereby assist in the expansion of the plastic foam material. An example of this type of an apparatus is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,851,167.<br>
The flow molding apparatuses and related methods described above are suitable for the manufacture of many different types of plastic parts, including foamed plastic parts. Many of the foamed plastic parts made in accordance with these methods, however, are not sufficiently durable to withstand the abrasion that occurs during normal use of the parts, are not easily washable, cannot be texturized as desired, and/or do not include a non-skid surface as required for particular applications. Thus, there is a need in the art for a molding process that overcomes one or more of the problems associated with the methods for forming the foamed plastic parts described above. Brief Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a method of forming a hardened skin on one or more surfaces of a molded article. In accordance with this method, a formable material is mixed with a blowing agent to form a foam material. The foam material is then placed in a flow molding apparatus whereby an alternating dielectric field is applied across the foam material to form the molded article. Importantly, at the end of the molding cycle, a portion of the foam material remains under the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent so as to form a hardened skin on a surface of the molded article. The method of the present invention enables the fabrication of molded articles with hardened skins that are sufficiently durable to withstand the abrasion that occurs during normal use of the articles, are easily washable, may be texturized as desired, and/or include a non-skid surface as required for particular applications.<br>
In an exemplary method, a molded article is made from a formable material mixed with a blowing agent to form a foam material. The foam material is placed in a flow molding<br>
3<br><br>
apparatus such that the top surface of the foam material is in contact with a top mold of the apparatus and the bottom surface of the foam material is in contact with a bottom mold of the apparatus. In operation, an alternating dielectric field is applied across the foam material to form the molded article such that a hardened skin is formed on the bottom surface thereof.<br>
In this example, a hardened skin is not desired on the top surface of the molded article. As such, the top mold is modified so that its bottom surface reaches a temperature mat is substantially the same as the molding temperature of the foam material at the end of the molding cycle. Preferably, the top mold is modified by adjusting its power factor via the use of one or more suitable additives. By matching the temperature of the top mold to the molding temperature of the foam material, the top surface of the foam material will be fully blown at the end of molding cycle. As such, a hardened skin will not be formed on the top surface of the molded article.<br>
In order to form a hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article, a bottom electrode of the apparatus is chilled so as to reduce the temperature of the bottom mold. By doing so, the bottom surface of the foam material will not be blown at the end of the molding cycle such that a hardened skin will be formed on the bottom surface of the molded article. The thickness of the<br>
hardened skin is dependent on a variety of factors, including the thermal conductivity of the bottom mold, the power factor of the bottom mold, and the temperature of the bottom electrode (and thus the temperature of the bottom mold). One or more of these factors may be adjusted in order to increase or decrease the thickness of the hardened skin as desired for a particular type of molded article.<br>
In general, the method of the present invention may be used to make a molded article from a single foam material placed between the top and bottom molds of a flow molding apparatus. In particular, a hardened skin may be formed on the top surface of the molded article by reducing the temperature of the top mold, on the bottom surface of the molded article by reducing the temperature of the bottom mold, or both. Alternatively, the method may be used to make a molded article from two or more different formable materials (at least one of which is a foam material) placed between the top and bottom molds of a flow molding apparatus. In this case, a hardened skin may be formed on one or more surfaces of the molded article by reducing the temperature of the mold in contact with the foam material. Accordingly, the method may be used to make a variety of different types of molded articles in accordance with the present invention. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The method of the present invention will be described in greater detail in the following detailed description of the invention with reference to the accompanying drawings that<br>
form a part hereof, in which:<br>

The present invention is directed to a method of forming a hardened skin on one or more surfaces of a molded article. In accordance with this method, a formable material is mixed with a blowing agent to form a foam material. The foam material is then placed between a top mold and a bottom mold of a flow molding apparatus whereby an alternating dielectric field is applied across the foam material to form the molded article. The temperature of at least one of the top and bottom molds is reduced so that a surface of the foam material will remain under the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent at the end of the molding cycle to thereby form a hardened skin on the molded article. One skilled in the art will understand that the method of the present invention may be used to manufacture a variety of different types of molded articles for use in a variety of different industries.<br>
As used herein, the term "foam material" means any formable material mixed with one or more blowing agents that may be heated to form a defined shape within a mold of a flow molding apparatus. As is known in the art, many different types of formable materials (including thermoplastics and thermosets) and many different types of blowing agents may be used to form a foam material and will vary depending on the molded article to be fabricated. It may also be desirable to mix one or more cross-linkers with the foam material in order to provide greater material strength. Examples of suitable foam materials include cross-linked PE-EVA foam, PVC foam, vinyl<br>
5<br><br>
nitrile foam, neoprene foam, foamed rubber, polypropylene, and blends of any of the foregoing. Of course, it should be understood that many other types of foam materials may also be used in accordance with the present invention.<br>
It should be understood that each of the foregoing foam materials has a molding temperature and molding time associated therewith. As used herein, the term "molding temperature" means the temperature at which a foam material is blown and/or cross-linked, and the term "molding time" means the amount of time required for a foam material to reach its molding temperature. It will be seen that any portion of a foam material that does not reach its molding temperature and remains under the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent will not be blown and, thus, will form a hardened skin on the surface of the molded article.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, The method of the present invention will now be described with reference to the diagram of a flow molding apparatus designated generally as numeral 10. Flow molding apparatus 10 includes a top electrode 12 and a bottom electrode 14, both of which are connected to an electromagnetic energy source (not shown) operable to generate an alternating electric field between the electrodes. The alternating electric field may be generated at frequencies ranging from 1 MHz to 500 MHz, is preferably generated at frequencies ranging from 10 MHz to 100 MHz, and is most preferably generated at either 26 MHz or 40 MHz. Also included within apparatus 10 are a top mold 16 and a bottom mold 18 that together define a molding cavity therebetween.<br>
In the illustrated example, a foam material 20 is placed within the molding cavity such that a top surface of foam material 20 is in contact with top mold 16 and a bottom surface of foam material 20 is in contact with bottom mold 18. Of course, it should be understood that additional formable materials could also be placed within the molding cavity as described in Applicant's co-pending patent application entitled "Method of Making a Molded Article from Two or more Different Formable Materials in a Single Heating Cycle," which is incorporated herein by reference. In operation, an alternating dielectric field is applied across foam material 20 to thereby form the molded article.<br>
It should be understood that flow molding apparatus 10 is merely an example of an apparatus that may be used to make a molded article in accordance with the method of the present invention. Other flow molding apparatuses and related methods may also be used, such as those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,268,238, U.S. Patent No. 4,441,876, U.S. Patent No. 4,524,037 and U.S. Patent No. 4,851,167, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Referring still to FIG. 1, it can be seen that there are three layers of material between top electrode 12 and bottom electrode 14, namely, top mold 16 Gayer 1), foam material 20 (layer 2),<br>
6<br><br>
and bottom mold 18 (layer 3). The following general equations may be established with respect to these three layers of material (which will be used hereinbelow to describe the method of the present invention). It should be understood that the subscript i in these equations denotes the layer number of the particular material (i.e., subscript 1 denotes top mold 16 (layer 1), subscript 2 denotes foam material 20 (layer 2), and subscript 3 denotes bottom mold 18 (layer 3)).<br>
First, the capacitance of each layer of material may be expressed by the following<br><br><br>
equation:<br><br>
(1)<br><br>
where<br>
C, = capacitance of layer i in picofarads<br>
e,- = relative dielectric constant of layer i<br>
At = area of layer / in inches2<br>
di = thickness of layer i in inches.<br>
The equivalent capacitance of all three layers of material is given by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(2)where<br>
Ceq = equivalent capacitance of layers in picofarads<br>
C1 = capacitance of layer 1 in picofarads<br>
C2 = capacitance of layer 2 in picofarads<br>
C3 - capacitance of layer 3 in picofarads.<br>
The equivalent reactance associated with the equivalent capacitance of all three layers of material may then be given by the following equation:<br><br><br>
where<br>
Xeg = equivalent reactance of layers in ohms<br>
F= frequency of dielectric field in hertz<br>
Ceq = equivalent capacitance of layers in farads.<br><br>
(3)<br><br>
7<br><br>
The resistance of each layer of material is equal to the product of the power factor of that layer and the equivalent reactance. Therefore, using the equivalent reactance from equation (3), the resistance of each layer of material may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
(4)<br><br>
where<br>
Ri = resistance of layer i in ohms<br>
pfi = power factor of layer i<br>
f= frequency of dielectric field in hertz<br>
Ci = capacitance of layer i in farads.<br>
Next, the current passing between top electrode 12 and bottom electrode 14 through all three layers of material may be represented by the following equation:<br><br>
(5)<br>
where<br>
J= current in amperes<br>
V= voltage between the electrodes in volts<br>
Xeq = equivalent reactance of layers in ohms<br>
Req = equivalent resistance of layers in ohms.<br>
Assuming mat the equivalent resistance of all three layers of material is small compared to the equivalent reactance, equation (5) may be simplified as follows:<br><br>
(6)<br>
Furthermore, the power mat is dissipated in each layer of material due to the application of the dielectric field may be expressed by the following equation:<br><br><br>
                                                           (7)<br>
 where              <br>
Pi - power of layer i in watts due to the dielectric field<br>
Rt = resistance of layer i in ohms<br>
1= current in amperes.<br>
By combining equations (4) and (7), the power that is dissipated in each layer of material due to the application of the dielectric field may be expressed as follows:<br>
8<br><br><br>
(8)<br>
Now, the increase in temperature of each layer of material during the heating cycle may be represented by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(9)<br>
where<br>
ΔTi = increase in temperature of layer i in degrees Celsius<br>
Pi . power of layer i in watts due to the dielectric field<br>
U = molding time of layer i in seconds<br>
hi= specific heat of layer i<br>
p t = specific gravity of layer /<br>
di = thickness of layer i in inches.<br>
By combining equations (8) and (9), the increase in temperature of each layer of material during the heating cycle may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
(10)<br><br>
By solving equation (10) for tis the molding time for each layer of material may be expressed by the following equation:<br><br>
(11)<br>
Equation (11) may then be solved for pfi such that the power factor for each layer of material may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
(12)<br><br>
In accordance with the method of the present invention, a hardened skin may be formed on one or more surfaces of foam material 20. In this example, a hardened skin will be formed only on the bottom surface of foam material 20 (although it should be understood that a hardened skin could also be formed on the top surface of foam material 20 if desired). Accordingly, the following steps may be performed using the method of the present invention: (1) calculate the molding time of foam material 20; (2) modify top mold 16 so that the top surface of foam material 20 will be fully blown (and preferably cross-linked) at the end of the heating cycle; and (3) reduce<br>
9<br><br>
the temperature of bottom mold 18 so mat a hardened skin is formed on the bottom surface of foam<br>
material 20 at the end of the heating cycle. Each of these steps will be described in detail<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
Step 1: Calculate Molding Time of Foam Material<br>
First, equation (11) may be used to calculate the molding time (t2) of foam material 20<br>
{i.e., the time that it takes for foam material 20 to reach its molding temperature). It can be seen<br>
from equation (11) mat the molding time (t2) of foam material 20 is a function of the following<br>
factors: the increase in temperature (ΔT2) required for foam material 20 to reach its molding<br>
temperature; the specific heat (h2) of foam material 20; the specific gravity (p2) of foam material 20;<br>
the thickness (d2) and capacitance (C2) of foam material 20; the power factor (pf2) of foam material<br>
20; the current (I) passing between top electrode 12 and bottom electrode 14 (which may be<br>
calculated from equation (6)); and the frequency (f) of the dielectric field.<br>
Step 2: Modify TOP Mold So That Top Surface of Foam Material Will Be Fully Blown<br>
Second, the molding time (t2) of foam material 20 (as calculated in step 1) is used to calculate a required power factor (pf2) for top mold 16. As stated above, the temperature of top mold 16 is desirably chosen so that the top surface of foam material 20 will be fully blown at the end of the heating cycle. As such, the required power factor (pf1) for top mold 16 will be the power factor that allows the bottom surface of top mold 16 to reach a temperature mat is substantially the same as the molding temperature of foam material 20 at the end of the heating cycle.<br>
Equation (12) may be used to calculate the required power factor (pf1) for top mold 16. It can be seen from equation (12) that the required power factor (pf1) for top mold 16 is a function of the following factors: the increase in temperature (ΔT1) required for top mold 16 to reach the molding temperature of foam material 20; the specific heat (hi) of top mold 16; the specific gravity (p1) of top mold 16; the thickness (d1) and capacitance (C1) of top mold 16; the frequency (f) of the dielectric field; the molding time (t2) of foam material 20; and the current (I) passing between top electrode 12 and bottom electrode 14 (which may be calculated from equation (6)).<br>
Next, the power factor of top mold 16 is adjusted to match its required power factor. The power factor of top mold 16 may be adjusted by various means known in the art, and is preferably adjusted by selecting an additive, calculating an amount of the additive to be mixed with the material of top mold 16 so mat the power factor substantially matches the required power factor, and then mixing the calculated amount of additive with the material of top mold 16. It should be understood that a selected additive may be used to increase or decrease the power factor of the material and, preferably, does not otherwise alter the properties of the material. It may also be<br>
10<br><br>
desirable to use a mixture of two or more additives depending on the power factor of each of the additives as a function of temperature.<br>
Once an additive(s) is selected for top mold 16, the following general equations may be used to calculate the amount of the additive to be mixed with the material of top mold 16 so that the power factor substantially matches the required power factor. First, the power factor equivalent for the material/additive mixture may be expressed by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(13)<br><br>
where<br>
Pfeq = power factor equivalent of the material/additive mixture<br>
Pf material= power factor of the material to be modified<br>
pf additive = power factor of the selected additive<br>
d maieriai = thickness of the material to be modified<br>
d adduive - thickness of the selected additive<br>
Ematerial - relative dielectric constant of the material to be modified<br>
E addmve - relative dielectric constant of the selected additive.<br>
Now, assume x is the percentage of the mixture by volume comprising the additive and (100-x) is the percentage of the mixture by volume comprising the material. Substituting x for daddWve and (100-x) for dmaterial, equation (13) may be rewritten as follows:<br><br>
(14)<br><br><br>
Equation (14) may then be solved for x and rewritten as follows:<br>
Thus, equation (IS) may be used to calculate the amount of the selected additive to be mixed with the material of top mold 16 so mat the power factor equivalent (pfeg,) of the mixture substantially matches the required power factor (pfi) of top mold 16 calculated above (i-e.,pfeq=pf1). As such, the bottom surface of top mold 16 will reach a temperature that is substantially the same as the molding temperature of foam material 20 whereby the top surface of foam material 20 will be fully blown at the end of the heating cycle. Accordingly, a hardened skin will not be formed on the top surface of the molded article.<br>
11<br><br>
Step 3: Reduce Temperature of Bottom Mold to Form Hardened Skin on Bottom Surface of Foam Material<br>
Third, the molding time (t2) of foam material 20 (as calculated in step 1) is used to calculate the increase in temperature (ΔT3) of bottom mold 18 at the end of the heating cycle. Preferably, bottom electrode 14 is chilled throughout the heating cycle so that the temperature of bottom mold 18 may be substantially reduced to enable the formation of a hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article. Equation (10) may be used to calculate the increase in temperature (ΔT3) of bottom mold 18, which is a function of the following factors: the power factor (pf3) of bottom mold 18; the current (7) passing between top electrode 12 and bottom electrode 14 (which may be calculated from equation (6)); the molding time (t2) of foam material 20; the frequency (/) of the dielectric field; the specific heat (h3) of bottom mold 18; the specific gravity (p3) of bottom mold 18; and the thickness (d3) and capacitance (C3) of bottom mold 18.<br>
Because the temperature of bottom mold 18 will be less than the temperature of foam material 20, a certain amount of heat will be transferred from foam material 20 to bottom mold 18 during the heating cycle. The amount of heat exchange will depend on the thermal conductivity (k2) of foam material 20 and the thermal conductivity (k3) of bottom mold 18. Specifically, the heat gained or lost by foam material 20 is given by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(16)<br><br>
where<br>
Q2 = power gained/ lost by layer 2 in watts due to heat exchange with layer 3<br>
£2 = thermal conductivity of layer 2 in watts/inches2/inch/°C<br>
T2 = temperature of layer 2 in degrees Celsius<br>
T2,3 - temperature at the interface of layers 2 and 3 in degrees Celsius<br>
Similarly, the heat gained or lost by bottom mold 18 is given by the following<br>
equation:<br><br><br>
(17)<br>
where<br>
Q3 = power gained/lost by layer 3 in watts due to heat exchange with layer 2 £3 = thermal conductivity of layer 3 in watts/inches2/inch/°C 72,3 = temperature at the interface of layers 2 and 3 in degrees Celsius T3 - temperature of layer 3 in degrees Celsius<br>
12<br><br>
Because the heat gained or lost by foam material 20 (Q2) is equal to the heat gained or lost by bottom mold 18 (Q3) such that Q2 + Q3 =0, equations (16) and (17) may be combined as follows:<br><br><br>
(18)<br><br>
Equation (18) may then be solved for T2,3 such that the temperature at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 is given by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(19)<br><br>
Now, referring to FIG. 2, an enlarged view of foam material 20 in relation to top mold 16 and bottom mold 18 is provided wherein a centerline 22 has been drawn through foam material 20. Because the total thickness of foam material 20 is d2, the thickness of foam material between centerline 22 and the interface of foam material 20 with bottom mold 18 is d2l2. Of course, the thickness of foam material between centerline 22 and the interface of foam material 20 with top mold 16 would also be d2/2.<br><br>
At the end of the heating cycle, the temperature of foam material 20 at centerline 22 will be the molding temperature (T2) of foam material 20. However, the temperature of foam material 20 below centerline 22 will vary from the molding temperature (T2) of foam material 20 (i.e., the temperature at centerline 22) to the temperature (T2,3) derived from equation (19) above (i.e., the temperature at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18). A temperature line 24 drawn from centerline 22 to the interface of foam material 20 with bottom mold 18 will have a slope represented by the following equation:<br>
(20)<br>
where<br>
slope = slope of temperature line<br>
T3 = temperature of layer 3 in degrees Celsius<br>
T2,3 = temperature at the interface of layers 2 and 3 in degrees Celsius<br>
di = thickness of layer 2 in inches<br>
It should be understood that the blowing agent in foam material 20 will have a decomposition temperature (TB) associated therewith, which is less than the molding temperature (T2) of foam material 20. Assuming that the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent is greater than the temperature (T2,3) at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 (as<br>
13<br><br>
shown in FIG. 2), the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent may be represented by the following equation:<br><br><br>
(21)<br><br>
where<br>
x - thickness of layer 2 that remains under TB in inches<br>
TB = decomposition temperature of blowing agent in degrees Celsius<br>
T13 = temperature at the interface of layers 2 and 3 in degrees Celsius<br>
slope = slope of temperature line<br>
The thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent will not be blown at the end of the heating cycle and, thus, will form a hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article.<br>
Based on the equations above, it should be understood that the thickness of the hardened skin formed on the bottom surface of the molded article is dependent on a variety of factors, including the thermal conductivity (k3) of bottom mold 18, the power factor (pf3) of bottom mold 18, and the temperature of bottom electrode 14. For example, the thickness of the hardened skin may be increased by increasing the thermal conductivity (k3) of bottom mold 18, decreasing the power factor (p/s) of bottom mold 18, and/or decreasing the temperature of bottom electrode 14. Conversely, the thickness of the hardened skin may be decreased by decreasing the thermal conductivity (k3) of bottom mold 18, increasing the power factor (pf3) of bottom mold 18, and/or increasing the temperature of bottom electrode 14. Thus, one or more of these factors may be adjusted in order to increase or decrease the thickness of the hardened skin as desired for a particular type of molded article.<br>
It should be understood that the analysis set forth above will provide a close approximation of the values for the molding time (t2) of foam material 20, the required power factor (pfi) of top mold 16, the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18, and the thickness (JC) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent (which forms the hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article). However, if more exact values are desired, it is necessary to take into account the heat exchange between adjacent layers of material in time over the course of the heating cycle.<br>
The heat generated in a layer of material / due to the adjacent layer i-1 may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
(22)<br><br>
14<br><br>
where<br>
Q,i-ii = power of layer i in watts due to heat exchange from layer i-1<br>
h-i - thermal conductivity of layer i-1 in watts/inches2/inch/°C<br>
ki = thermal conductivity of layer i* in watts/inches2/uich/°C<br>
Ti-i = temperature of layer i-1 in degrees Celsius<br>
Ti = temperature of layer i in degrees Celsius<br>
di = thickness of layer i in inches<br>
Similarly, the heat generated in a layer of material i due to the adjacent layer i+1 may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
(23)<br><br>
where<br>
Qi, i+i = power of layer i in watts due to heat exchange from layer i+1<br>
ki+i = thermal conductivity of layer i+1 in watts/inches2/inch/°C<br>
kt = thermal conductivity of layer i in watts/inches2/inch/°C<br>
ri+y = temperature of layer i+1 in degrees Celsius<br>
Ti = temperature of layer i in degrees Celsius<br>
di = thickness of layer i in inches<br>
Accordingly, equations (22) and (23) may be combined such that the heat generated in a layer of material i due to both of the adjacent layers i-1 and i+1 may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br>
(24)<br><br>
Now, by combining equations (8) and (24), the total power dissipated in a layer of material i due to the application of the dielectric field and the heat exchange between adjacent layers of material may be expressed as follows:<br><br>
One skilled in the art will understand that equation (25) may be used (in place of equation (8)) in connection with the analysis set forth above to calculate more exact values for the molding time (fc) of foam material 20, the required power factor (pfi) of top mold 16, the temperature (Tj) of bottom mold 18, and the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent. As will be described in greater detail with reference to Example 3 below, these calculations are preferably performed at regular time intervals (such as 1 second time intervals) in order to determine Pi- + Qi for each of the layers of material at<br>
15<br><br>
each of the time intervals. Of course, a computer may be programmed to perform these calculations in order to simplify the analysis.<br>
It should also be understood that the analysis set forth above does not take into account the fact that the power factor, relative dielectric constant, specific heat and thermal conductivity of each of the layers of material vary with temperature. Therefore, when performing (he calculations at regular time intervals as discussed above, it is preferable to use the values for the power factor, relative dielectric constant, specific heat and thermal conductivity that correspond to the temperature of each of the layers of material at that particular point in time. By doing so, it is possible to obtain even more exact values for the molding time (t2) of foam material 20, the required power factor (pf1) of top mold 16, the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18, and the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent (which forms the hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article).<br>
It should further be understood that the analysis set forth above does not consider the exothermic or endothermic reaction that occurs when a blowing agent reaches its decomposition temperature (which, for many blowing agents, is 150 °C). The change in heat caused by this exothermic or endothermic reaction varies in time and may be added to the above equations if desired. Of course, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the impact of the exothermic or endothermic reaction is not highly significant because it occurs near the end of the heating cycle and does not involve a large amount of energy.<br>
Three examples will now be provided with reference to the flow molding apparatus of FIGS. 1 and 2 to further describe the method of the present invention. It should be understood that these examples are provided merely to illustrate the manner in which the method may be used to manufacture a molded article with a hardened skin and do not in any way limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Assume for purposes of this example that top mold 16 and bottom mold 18 of flow molding apparatus 10 are each formed from silicone rubber V-1008 (manufactured by Rhodia Inc.) and foam material 20 comprises an EVA foam blend. Table 1 is provided below to show various factors for each of these layers of material, namely, the desired temperature (I) at the end of the heating cycle, thickness (), power factor (pf), relative dielectric constant (e), specific heat (h), and specific gravity (p). These factors will be used hereinbelow to perform various calculations in accordance with the method of the present invention.<br>
16<br><br>
TABLE 1<br><br>
	Top Mold (layer 1)	Foam Material (layer 2)	Bottom Mold (layer 3)<br>
DesiredTemperature (7) (degrees Celsius)	200	200	<br>
Thickness (cQ (inches)	.125	.375	.125<br>
Power Factor (pf)		.0137	.0033<br>
Relative Dielectric Constant (e)	3.07	2.67	2.67<br>
Specific Heat (h)	1.233	1.566	1.233<br>
Specific Gravity (p)	1.16	1.041	1.16<br>
As can be seen from Table 1, the desired temperature of foam material 20 at the end of the heating cycle is its molding temperature of 200 °C (the temperature at which foam material 20 is fully blown and cross-linked). In Ms example, it is desired that the top surface of the molded article be fully blown at the end of the heating cycle. As such, the desired temperature of the bottom surface of top mold 16 at the end of the heating cycle is 200 °C (the molding temperature of foam material 20). On the other hand, a hardened skin is desired on the bottom surface of the molded article at the end of the heating cycle. As such, bottom electrode 14 is chilled and maintained at 0 °C throughout the heating cycle so that the temperature of bottom mold 18 is substantially reduced. The exact temperature of bottom mold 18 at the end of the heating cycle will be calculated hereinbelow.<br>
Table 1 also shows the various values for the thickness (d) of each of the layers of material which, as illustrated in FIG. 1, are shown as being constant along the length of the molded article. It should be understood, however, that the thickness of foam material 20 may vary at different points along the length of the molded article. In that case, bottom mold 18 would preferably be configured so that its thickness varies in such a manner that the sum of the thickness values for foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 remain constant. As such, the total distance between top electrode 12 and bottom electrode 14 would remain constant to thereby provide uniform heating of foam material 20 (as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,268,238). It should also be noted that the relative dielectric constants (e) of foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 would preferably be equalized (as shown in Table 1) so that foam material 20 would be uniformly heated (as discussed in U.S. Patent No. 4,441,876).<br>
In addition, Table 1 shows the various values for the power factor {pf), relative dielectric constant (e), specific heat (h) and specific gravity (p) for each of the layers of material. As discussed above, the values for the power factor (pf), relative dielectric constant (e) and specific heat (h) vary with temperature. For example, FIG. 3 illustrates the temperature dependence of the power<br>
17<br><br>
factor {pf) for each of the layers of material, FIG. 4 illustrates the temperature dependence of the relative dielectric constant (e) for each of the layers of material, and FIG. 5 illustrates the temperature dependence of the specific heat (A) for each of the layers of material. It should be understood that the curves of FIGS. 3-5 were each integrated over the entire temperature range and the resultant averages are shown in Table 1 (which will be used to provide a close approximation of various values in accordance with the analysis set forth above).<br>
In accordance with the method of the present invention, equations (1)-(21) may be used to calculate the molding time of foam material 20, the required power factor of top mold 16, the temperature of bottom mold 18, and the thickness of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent It should be understood that me subscripts used in the following equations denote the layer number of the particular material (Le., subscript 1 denotes top mold 16 (layer 1), subscript 2 denotes foam material 20 (layer 2), and subscript 3 denotes bottom mold 18 Gayer 3)).<br>
The capacitance of each of the layers of material maybe calculated from equation (1) using the values for the relative dielectric constant (e,) and thickness (dt) shown in Table 1 (assuming that the area of each of the layers of material is 1 inch2):<br><br><br>
Next, the equivalent capacitance may be calculated from equation (2) using the capacitance values for each of the layers of material derived above:<br><br>
18<br>
The equivalent reactance may then be calculated from equation (3) using the equivalent capacitance (£&gt;,) derived above (assuming that the frequency of the electric field is 40 MHz):<br><br><br>
The current passing between top electrode 112 and bottom electrode 114 through all of the layers of material may then be calculated from equation (6) using the equivalent reactance (Xeq) derived above (assuming that the voltage is 4,000 volts):<br><br>
First, in accordance with step 1 above, the molding time for foam material 20 may be calculated from equation (11) using the current (J) and capacitance {C2) derived above and the values for the temperature (T2), thickness (d2), power factor (pf2), specific heat (h2), and specific gravity (p2) shown in Table 1 (assuming that the starting temperature is 0 °C):<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the molding time for foam material 20 is 63.54 seconds (i.e., the time that it takes foam material 20 to reach its molding temperature of 200 °C).<br>
Second, in accordance with step 2 above, a required power factor for top mold 16 may be calculated from equation (12) using the molding time (t2) for foam material 20, the current (I) and capacitance (C/) derived above, and the values for the temperature (T1), thickness (d1), specific heat (Ay), and specific gravity (1i) shown in Table 1 (again, assuming that the starting temperature is 0 °C):<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the required power factor for top mold 16 is 0.01368 (i.e., the power factor that would allow the bottom surface of top mold 16 to reach a temperature of 200 °C at substantially the same time that foam material 20 reaches its molding temperature of 200 °C). It should be understood that the power factor of top mold 16 may be adjusted by selecting a polar additive, calculating the amount of the polar additive to be mixed with the material of top mold 16 so that the power factor matches the required power factor derived above, and then mixing the calculated amount of the polar additive with the material of top mold 16.<br>
Third, in accordance with step 3 above, the temperature of bottom mold 18 at the end of the heating cycle may be calculated from equation (10) using the current (I), the calculated molding time (t2) for foam material 20, and the capacitance (C3) derived above, and the values for the power factor (pf3), specific heat (h3), specific gravity (p3), and thickness (d3) shown in Table 1:<br><br>
19<br><br>
Thus, the temperature of bottom mold 18 at the end of the heating cycle is 55.48 °C (assuming bottom electrode 14 is chilled and maintained at 0 °C throughout the heating cycle).<br>
Next, the temperature at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 may be calculated from equation (19) using the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18 derived above and the value for the temperature {T2) of foam material 20 shown in Table 1 (assuming mat the thermal conductivity of foam material 20 is 0.00638 and the thermal conductivity of bottom mold 18 is 0.00585):<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the temperature at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 is 130.87 °C.<br>
Equation (20) may then be used to determine the slope of temperature line 24 using the temperature (T2,3) at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 derived above<br>
and the values for the temperature (T2) of foam material 20 and the thickness (di) of foam material 20 shown in Table 1:<br><br>
Thus, the slope 01 temperature line 24 is 368.68 C/inch.<br>
Now, the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent may be calculated from equation (21) using the temperature (T2.3) at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 derived above and the slope of temperature line 24 derived above (assuming that the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent in foam material 20 is 150 °C):<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent is 0.0519 inches. As such, a layer of foam material 20 having a thickness of 0.0519 inches will not be blown at the end of the heating cycle and, thus, will form a hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article.<br>
Example 2 Assume for purposes of this example that bottom mold 18 is formed from silicone rubber V-1075 (manufactured by Rhodia Inc.), which contains iron oxide and thus has a higher thermal conductivity than the silicone rubber V-1008 used in Example 1. Specifically, the thermal<br>
20<br><br>
conductivity of silicone rubber V-107S is 0.0241. All of the calculations and values of Example 1 remain unchanged, with the exception of the following analysis.<br>
The temperature at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 may be calculated from equation (19) using the temperature (7» of bottom mold 18 derived in Example 1 above and the value for the temperature (T3) of foam material 20 shown in Table 1 (assuming that the thermal conductivity of foam material 20 is still 0.00638 while the thermal conductivity of bottom mold 18 is now 0.0241):<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the temperature at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 is now 85.73 °C.<br>
Equation (20) may then be used to determine the slope of temperature line 24 using the temperature (T2) at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 derived above and the values for the temperature (T2) of foam material 20 and the thickness (d2) of foam material 20 shown in Table 1:<br><br><br><br>
Thus, the slope of temperature line 24 is now 609.44 °C/inch.<br>
Now, the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent may be calculated from equation (21) using the temperature (T2,3) at the interface between foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 derived above and the slope of temperature line 24 derived above (again, assuming that the decomposition temperature (7s) of the blowing agent in foam material 20 is 150 °C):<br><br>
Thus, the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent is now 0.105 inches. As such, a layer of foam material 20 having a thickness of 0.105 inches will not be blown at the end of the heating cycle and, thus, will form a hardened skin on the bottom surface of the molded article.<br>
In comparing this example to Example 1, it can be seen that increasing the thermal conductivity (k3) of bottom mold 18 functions to increase the thickness of the hardened skin formed on the bottom surface of the molded article. Alternatively, as discussed above, the thickness of the hardened skin could also be increased by decreasing the power factor (pfi) of bottom mold 18 or decreasing the temperature of bottom electrode 14.<br>
21<br><br>
Example 3<br>
In this example, equation (25) (which is a combination of equations (8) and (24)) will be used to calculate mote exact values for the molding time (t2) of foam material 20, the temperature (7j) of bottom mold 18, and the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent (as compared to the values calculated in Example 1 above). It should be understood that the subscripts used in the following equations denote the layer number of the particular material (i.e., subscript 1 denotes top mold 16 (layer 1), subscript 2 denotes foam material 20 (layer 2), subscript 3 denotes bottom mold 18 (layer 3), and subscript 4 denotes bottom electrode 14 (layer 4)).<br>
The power (P2) that is dissipated in foam material 20 due to the application of the dielectric field may be calculated from equation (8) using the current (I) and capacitance (Ci) derived in Example 1 above and the value for the power factor (pfi) shown in Table 1 (assuming that the frequency of the electric field is 40 MHz):<br><br><br><br>
The power {P2) that is generated in foam material 20 due to the heat exchange from top mold 16 and bottom mold 18 may be calculated from equation (24) using the thickness () of foam material 20 shown in Table 1:<br><br><br><br>
As discussed above, top mold 16 is heated at the same rate as foam material 20 such that T}-T2~ 0. Thus, the above equation may be simplified as follows (assuming that the thermal conductivity of foam material 20 is 0.00638 and the thermal conductivity of bottom mold 18 is 0.00585):<br><br>
Similarly, the power (P3) that is dissipated in bottom mold 18 due to the application of the dielectric field may be calculated from equation (8) using the current (I) and capacitance (C2) derived in Example 1 above and the value for the power factor (pfi) shown in Table 1 (again, assuming that the frequency of the electric field is 40 MHz):<br><br>
22<br><br>
The power (Q3) that is generated in bottom mold 18 due to the heat exchange from foam material 20 and bottom electrode 14 may be calculated from equation (24) using the thickness (d3) of bottom mold 18 shown in Table 1:<br><br>
As discussed above, bottom electrode 14 is chilled and maintained at 0 °C throughout the heating cycle such mat 7V = 0. Also, because the thermal conductivity (k4) of bottom electrode 14 is very large compared to the thermal conductivity (k3) of bottom mold 18, the above equation may be simplified as follows (again, assuming mat the thermal conductivity of foam material 20 is 0.00638 and me thermal conductivity of bottom mold 18 is 0.00585):<br><br>
Now, the time (Δt) required for foam material 20 to reach its molding temperature of 200 °C may be expressed by the following equation using the power (P2) and (2i) derived above and the values for the thickness {d2), specific heat (hi), and specific gravity (pi) shown in Table 1:<br><br>
Next, the increase in the temperature (ΔT3) of bottom mold 18 may be expressed by the following equation using the power (P3) and (Q3) derived above and the values for the thickness (d3), specific heat (h3), and specific gravity (p3) shown in Table 1:<br><br>
Equations (26) and (27) will now be calculated at 1 second time intervals in order to calculate more exact values for the molding time (t2) of foam material 20, the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18, and the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition<br>
temperature (TB) of the blowing agent<br>
At the beginning of the heating cycle, the temperature (Ti) of foam material 20 is 0 °C and me temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18 is 0 °C. Thus, after a 1 second time interval, equation (26) may be expressed as follows:<br>
23<br><br><br><br>
This equation may then be solved such that AT* = 3.13 °C. As such, the temperature (T2) of foam material 20 after 1 second of heating is 3.13 °C. Equation (27) may also be expressed as follows:<br><br>
This equation may then be solved such that ΔT3 = 0.7489 °C.   As such, the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18 after 1 second of heating is 0.7489 °C.<br>
Now, after another 1 second time interval, equation (26) may be expressed as follows:<br><br><br><br>
This equation may then be solved such that ΔT2 = 3.126 °C. As such, the temperature (T2) of foam material 20 after 2 seconds of heating is 6.250 °C. Equation (27) may also be expressed as follows:<br><br>
This equation may then be solved such that ΔT3 - 0.7731 °C.  As such, the temperature (7jr) of bottom mold 18 after 2 seconds of heating is 1.522 °C.<br>
It should be understood that the above steps may be repeated at every 1 second time interval until the temperature (T2) of foam material 20 reaches 200 °C. By doing so, it can be determined that the molding time (t2) of foam material 20 is 66 seconds (compared to 63.54 seconds as calculated in Example 1). Also, after 66 seconds of heating, the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18 is 78.83 °C (compared to 55.48 °C as calculated in Example 1). In addition, the temperature (T23) at the interface of foam material 20 and bottom mold 18 after 66 seconds of heating is 142 °C (compared to 130.87 °C as calculated in Example 1). As such, the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of me blowing agent is 0.0258 inches (compared to 0.0519 inches as calculated in Example 1).<br>
Thus, it can be seen that calculating equations (26) and (27) at regular time intervals results in more accurate values for the molding time (t2) of foam material 20, the temperature (T3) of bottom mold 18 at the end of the heating cycle, and the thickness (x) of foam material 20 that remains under the decomposition temperature (TB) of the blowing agent<br>
Finally, it should be understood that the method of the present invention may be used to make a molded article from a single foam material placed in a molding cavity of a flow molding apparatus. In particular, a hardened skin may be formed on one or more surfaces (e.g., top surface, bottom surface, side surface, etc.) of the molded article by reducing the temperature of one or more of the molds mat are in contact with the foam material. Alternatively, the method may be used to<br>
24<br><br>
make a molded article from two or more different formable materials (at least one of which is a foam material) placed in a molding cavity of a flow molding apparatus. Again, a hardened skin may be formed on the molded article by reducing the temperature of one or more of the molds that are in contact with the foam material.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it should be understood that the method of the present invention enables the fabrication of molded articles with hardened skins mat are sufficiently durable ' to withstand the abrasion that occurs during normal use of the articles. The method may also be used to make molded articles with hardened skins that are easily washable. The method may further be used to fabricate molded articles with hardened skins that may be texturized as desired. In addition, the method may be used to make molded articles with hardened skins that have higher coefficients of friction to thereby provide non-skid surfaces as required for particular applications. Of course, other advantages of the present invention should be apparent to one skilled in the art.<br>
While the present invention has been described and illustrated hereinabove with reference to an exemplary method, it should be understood mat various modifications could be made to this method without departing from the scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention is not to be limited to the exemplary method described and illustrated hereinabove, except insofar as such limitations are included in the following claims.<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
30<br>
A method of forming a hardened skin on a surface of a molded article. In an exemplary method, a formable material is mixed with a blowing agent to form a foam material (20). The foam material (20) is placed in a flow molding apparatus (10) such that the top surface of the foam material is in contact with the top mold (16) of the apparatus and the bottom surface of the foam material is in contact with the bottom mold (18) of the apparatus. In operation, an alternating dielectric field is applied across the foam material (20) to form the molded article. At the end of the molding cycle, the bottom surface of the foam material (20) remains under the decomposition temperature of the blowing agent so as to form a hardened skin on the molded article.<br><br></td>
