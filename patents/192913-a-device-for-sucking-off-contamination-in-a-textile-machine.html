The invention relates to a device for sucking off contaminations in a textile machine, in particular of fibre fly. fluffs or similar on a drawing unit of a ring spinning frame, whereby at least one suction tube with one of its ends is connected with a suction cabinet and with an opening of its other end is being arranged to a roller in particular a roller of a drawing unit.<br>
Such a device is for instance described in the German utility model application (Gebrauchsmuster) G 92 03 2532. For the present invention reference is also made to the known art mentioned in said application.<br>
Conventionally, it is known that a number of suction tubes are connected with each other, and which are known as so called pan flute tubes". Six to eight of these tubes are then together arranged to a fluted roller of a drawings unit. When processing synthetic fibres in particular, an accumulation of windings occurs increasingly on the fluted roller, which not only causes thread breaks but also pushes the suction tubes away fiom the fluted roller, so that said tubes M downwards or are lowered. If one such large accumulation of windings occurs only in the vicinity of one single suction tube, the other suction tubes being connected with said tube are also pushed away torn the fluted roller and are lowered.<br>
Accordingly, in tiie neighbouring drawing units an effective suction is not maintained anymore, so that an accumulation of windings are also formed there very quickly, which causes thread breaks.   Thus one single accumulation of windings can cause problems in a series of neighbouring drawing units. It is the object of the present invention to overcome these drawbacks.<br><br>
The  task  as  object  of  the  invention  is  solved  in  that  the suction  tube  can  be  lowered  stepwise  by  an  angle  away  from  the roller.<br>
This  means  that  the  neighbouring  suction  tubes  are  independent so  that  during  an  accumulation  of  windings  near  one  of  the suction  tubes  only  this  tube  is  pushed  away  from  the  fluted roller  and  lowered,   the  neighbouring  suction  tubes,   however, are  not  affected.   This  means  that  in  particular  if  a  row  of suction  tubes  arranged  in  â€žpan  flute'-manner  in  a  tube  holder, still  the  lowering  movement  of  each  individual  tube  is possible,   independently  of  the  others.<br>
Preferably  the  suction  tube  is  provided  with  lateral  notches, which  are  guided  along  an  inner  guide  track.   By  means  of  said lateral  notches  the  suction  tube  can  be  lowered  into  the desired  different  positions.   Normally  it  is  sufficient  if  the inner  guide  track  is  provided  with  at  least  an  upper  and  a lower  positioning  trough,   which  are  separated  by  a  hiimp  in-between  them.   The  upper  positioning  trough  is  arranged  in  such a  way  that  the  opening  of  the  suction  tube  is  located  near  the fluted  roller;  by  sliding  the  suction  tube,   lateral  notches respectively  into  the  lower  positioning  trough,   the  opening  is relatively  far  away  from  the  fluted  roller.<br>
To  overcome  the  elevation  between  the  upper  and  the  lower positioning  trough  the  suction  tube  has  to  be  moved  axially. This  movement  takes  place  against  an  elastic  seal,   by  which  the suction  tube  is  supported  against  a  wall  of  the  suction cabinet.<br>
Preferably  a  number  of  suction  tubes  are  arranged  in  a  common tube  holder,   which  is  arranged  to  the  fluted  roller,   the drawing  unit  or  a  similar  device.   Said  tube  holder  is  also provided  with  the  above  mentioned  inner  guide  track,   whereby each  suction  tube  is  provided  with  its  own  inner  guide  track. This  allows  the  lowering  of  a  single  suction  tube,   while  the<br><br>
other  suction  tubes  remain  in  their  operating  position  to  serve :heir  task,   in  particular  the  prevention  of  an  accumulation  of drawings.   This  is  one  substantial  advantage  of  this  invention.<br>
Preferably  also  the  tube  holder  itself  and  thus  the  suction :ubes  arranged  within  it  should  be  lowered  together.   For  this :he  tube  holder  is  preferably  guided  by  means  of  lateral  guide elements  in  guide  tracks.   Thereby  the  guide  tracks  are  arranged jtationarily  on  a  part  of  the  machine,   for  example  on  a  side /all.   They  are  also  preferably  provided  with  at  least  two positioning  troughs  into  which  the  lateral  guide  elements  can be  slided.   This  also  preferably  takes  place  against  the  above mentioned  elastic  seal.  As  lateral  guide  elements  for  instance rollers  are  used,   which  facilitate  a  sliding  into  the  various positioning  troughs.<br>
In  a  preferred  embodiment  the  tube  holder  consists  of  a  single piece  element,   made  of  a  sheet  metal  strip.   Forming  is  done  by punching  out  corresponding  holes,   slots  and  a  folding  job.   For instance  the  front  wall  of  the  tube  holder  is  formed  to  the above  mentioned  inner  guide  track.  Via,   for  example intermediate  slanted  surface,   this  front  wall  is   followed  by  a top  wall  onto  which  again  a  rear  wall  is  folded,   which  is provided  with  holes  to  introduce  the  seals  or  the  ends  of  the suction  tubes.   Onto  the  longitudinal  side  of  the  top  wall follow  the  side  walls,   which  serve  to  hold  the  lateral  guides. By  this  simple  way  a  tube  holder  is  provided  which  not  only allows  separate  lowering  of  each  single  suction  tube,   but  which also  enables  that  the  entire  row  of  suction  tubes  can  be lowered.<br>
Further  advantages,   characteristics  and  details  of  the invention  will  be  disclosed  by  the  following  description  of preferred  embodiments  and  according  to  the  figure,   wherein:<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device for sucking off contaminations in a textile machine, in particular fibre material, fluffs or similar on a drawing unit of a ring spinning frame with at least one suction tube whereby one of its ends is connected with a suction cabinet and whereby an opening of its other end is being arranged to a roller, in particular a drawing roller, the suction tube being stepwise lowerable by an angle (w) away from the roller.<br>
Further advantages, characteristics and details of the invention will be disclosed by the following description of preferred embodiments and with reference to the accompanying drawinss. wherein:<br>
â– Â»&gt; â€”â– â– â– '<br><br>
Fig.   1	shows  a  partial  section  of  a  device  for  sucking  ofl<br>
contaminations  on  a  drawing  unit  of  a  ring  spinning frame<br>
Fig.   2	shows  a  side  view  of  the  tube  holder  according  to  the<br>
invention<br>
Fig.   3	shows  a  front  view  of  the  tube  holder  according  to<br>
figure  2.<br>
According  to  figure  1  between  a  suction  cabinet  1  serving  as  a central  suction  tube  and  an  only  partially  shown  drawing  unit 2,   a  device  R  according  to  the  invention  for  sucking  off contaminations  on  said  drawing  unit  2  is  arranged.  Within  said device  R  a  number  of  parallel  aligned  suction  tubes  3  are arranged  in  a  tube  holder  4,   whereby  each  suction  tube  3  is introduced  through  a  not   further  shown  opening  in  a  wall   6  of the  suction  cabinet  1  and  is  supported  against  the  wall   6  by means  of  an  elastic  seal  5.   The  elastic  seal  5  is  provided  with at  least  two  lateral  notches  5a  which  rest  in  the  corresponding recesses  5b  of  the  tube  holders  4  or  of  its  rear  wall  31   (see figure  3),   thus  turning  of  the  suction  tube  3  is  prevented, since  it  is  kept  in  frictional  contact  within  the  seal.<br>
At  the  opposite  end  of  the  part  of  the  suction  tube  3,   which  is mounted  in  the  seal  5,   the  suction  tube  3  is  provided  with  an opening  8  which  is  tailored  to  a  lower  drawing  unit  supply roller   (fluted  roller)   9,   through  which  the  contaminations  are sucked  off  the  fluted  roller  9.<br>
Below  the  opening  8  a  tongue  11  extends,   to  serve  as  a  grip  to move  the  suction  tube  within  the  tube  holder  4.<br>
Furthermore  the  suction  tube  3  has  a  collar  12  slipped  onto  it, from  which  lateral  notches  13  protrude.   Preferably  the  notches 13  are  arranged  approximately  parallel  to  the  notches  5a protruding  laterally.   In  the  present  exemplified  embodiment<br><br>
only  one  lateral  notch  13  is   shown,   which  rests  in  a positioning  trough  14  of  an  inner  guide  track  15,   whereby  said inner  guide  track  15  is  formed  by  the  front  wall   16  of  the  tube holder  4.   Besides  the  positioning  trough  14  the  inner  guide track  15  is  provided  with  a  further  lower  positioning  trough 17,   into  which  the  lateral  notch  13  can  be  moved.   Thus  an  axis A  of  the  suction  tube  3  moves  downwards  by  an  angle  w,   whereby the  lateral  notches  13  on  their  way  from  the  positioning  trough 14  to  the  lower  positioning  trough  17  pass  over  a  hump  18  of the  inner  guide  track  15.   During  the  passing  over  of  the  hump 18  the  suction  tube  3  is  moved  in  direction  of  the  axis  A against  the  seal  5,   which  is  possible  due  to  the  elastic property  of  said  seal  5.   The  return  force  of  the  seal  5  has  the effect  that  the  lateral  notch  13  is  also  pressed  into  the  lower positioning  trough  17  and  whereby  the  suction  tube  3  is  held.<br>
By  way  of  the  above  described  manner  all  single,   parallel aligned  suction  tubes  3  arranged  within  the  tube  holder  4  can be  lowered  separately.<br>
Also  within  the  scope  of  this  invention  it  is  included  that  the complete  tube  holder  4  can  be  lowered,   in  relation  to  the fluted  roller  9  to  which  a  pressure  roll  10  is  arranged.   This is  accomplished  by  means  of  two  lateral  guide  elements  19.1  and 19.2,   which  in  the  present  case  are  designed  as  rolls.   To  each lateral  guide  element  19  a  guide  track  20  is  arranged,   which  is fixedly  held  on  a  housing  wall  21.<br>
The  guide  track  20  is  provided  with  two  positioning  troughs  22 and  23,   into  which  the  lateral  guide  element  19  can  slide.   In figure  1  the  lateral  guide  element  19  is  in  the  upper positioning  trough  22,   if  however,   the  tube  holder  4  is  moved downwards  by  an  angle  w,   the  lateral  guide  element  19  moves over  a  trough  edge  24  of  the  guide  tracks  20,   whereby  the  tube holder  4  is  pressed  against  the  elastic  seal  5.  Afterwards  the lateral  guide  element  19,   indicated  with  dotted  lines,   glides into  the  lower  positioning  trough  23.<br><br>
According  to  figure  2  and  3  the  lateral  guide  elements   19.1  anc 19.2  protrude  from  the  side  walls  25  of  the  tube  holder  4.   For the  case  that  the  lateral  guide  elements  19  are  made  as  rolls, the  side  wall  25  can  be  provided  with  holes  26  to  hold  a  roller bearing.<br>
Both  side  walls  25  are  interconnected  through  a  top  wall  27, followed  by  a  slanted  surface  28  and  the  front  wall  16  with  the inner  guide  track  15.   In  particular  in  figure  3  it  is  shown that  the  front  wall  16  is  provided  with  slots  29,   into  each  of which  one  suction  tube  3  is  movably  mounted.<br>
The  front  wall   16  is  extended  by  a  lower  wall  part  30  into which  the  slots  29  also  extend.<br>
Towards the suction cabinet 1 the top wall 27 is followed by a rear wall 31, in which are holes 32 to hold the sealing 5, the end  of  the  suction  tube  respectively.<br>
Preferably  the  tube  holder  4,   consisting  of  lower  wall  part  30, front  wall  16,   slanted  surface  28,   top  wall  27,   rear  wall  31 and  side  walls  25,   is  a  single  piece  element,   for  instance  made of  metal.   For  this  the  single  piece  element  of  the  tube  holder 4  is  formed  of  sheet  metal  by  a  folding  job.<br><br>
