				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the hydrogenation of imines with hydrogen under elevated pressure in the presence of hydrogen iodide.<br>
US-A-4 994 615 describes a process for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral N-arylketimines wherein iridium catalysts having chiral diphosphine ligands are used. US-A-5 011 995 describes a process for the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral N-alkylketimines using the same catalysts. US-A-5 112 999 discloses polynuclear iridium compounds and a complex salt of iridium, which contain diphosphine ligands, as catalysts for the hydrogenation of imines.<br>
Those homogeneous catalysis processes have proved valuable, although it is evident, especially in the case of relatively large batches or on an industrial scale, that the catalysts frequently tend to become deactivated to a greater or lesser extent depending on the catalyst precursor, the substrate and the diphosphine ligands that are used. In many cases, especially at elevated temperatures - for example at temperatures &gt;25°C, which are necessary for a short reaction time - it is not possible to achieve complete conversion. For industrial applications of the hydrogenation processes, therefore, the catalyst productivity is too low to be economically viable.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly, that the catalyst activity can be increased by a factor of 10 or more if the reaction mixture contains hydrogen iodide. It has also unexpectedly been found that at the same time the deactivation of the catalysts can be considerably reduced or completely eliminated. It has also been found, surprisingly, that when asymmetric catalysts are used the enantioselectivity is high, and high optical yields of up to 80 % can be achieved, even at reaction temperatures of more than 50°C.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a process for the hydrogenation of an imine of the kind such as herein described, with hydrogen under elevated pressure in the presence of an iridium catalyst of the kind such as herein described and optionally with an inert solvent of the kind such as herein described, wherein the reaction mixture contains hydrogen iodide to form an amine.<br>
The invention relates to a process for the hydrogenation of imines with hydrogen under elevated pressure in the presence of iridium catalysts and with or without an inert solvent, wherein the reaction mixture contains hydrogen iodide.<br>
Suitable imines are especially those which contain at least one<br>
group. If the groups are substituted asymmetrically and are thus compounds having a prochiral ketimine group, it is possible in the process according to the invention for mixture of<br>
optical isomers or pure optical isomers to be formed if enantioselective or diastereo-selective iridium catalysts are used. The imines may contain further chiral carbon atoms. The free bonds in the above formulae may be saturated with hydrogen or organic radicals having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms or organic hetero radicals having from 1 to 20 carbon atoms and at least one hetero atom from the group O, S, N and P. The nitrogen atom of the<br>
group  may also be saturated with NH2 or a primary amino group having from 1 to 22 carbon atoms or a secondary amino group having from 2 to 40 carbon atoms. The organic radicals may be substituted, for example, by F, Cl, Br, C1-C4haloalkyl wherein halogen is preferably F or Cl, -CM, -NO2, -CO2H, -CONH2, -SO3H, -PO3H2, or C1-C12alkyl esters or amides, or by phenyl esters or benzyl esters of the groups -CO2H, -SO3H and -PO3H2. Aldimine and ketimine groups are especially reactive, with the result that using the process according to the invention it is possible selectively to hydrogenate<br>
groups in addition to the and/or  groups. Aldimine<br>
and ketimine groups are also to be understood to include hydrazone groups.<br>
The process according to the invention is suitable especially for the hydrogenation of aldimines, ketimines and hydrazones with the formation of corresponding amines and hydrazines, respectively. The ketimines are preferably N-substituted. It is preferable to use chiral iridium catalysts and to hydrogenate enantiomerically pure, chiral or prochiral ketimines to prepare optical isomers, the optical yields (enantiomeric excess, ee) being, for example, higher than 30 %, especially higher than 50 %, and yields of more than 90 % being achievable. The optical yield indicates the ratio of the two stereoisomers formed, which ratio may be, for example, greater than 2:1 and preferably greater than 4:1.<br>
The imines are preferably imines of formula I<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which are hydrogenated to form amines of formula II<br>

Kagan in Chiral Ligands for Asymmetric Catalysis, Asymmetric Synthesis, Volume 5, pp. 13-23, Academic Press Inc., N.Y. (1985). The preparation of ferrocenyl diphosphine ligands is described, for example, in EP-A-0 564 406 and by T. Hayashi et al. in Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn., 53, pages 1136-1151.<br>

Complex acids from which Ae can be derived are, for example, the halo complex acids of the elements B, P, As, Sb and Bi.

The preparation of the catalysts is known per se and is described, for example, in US-A-4 994 615, US-A-5 01 1 995, US-A-5 112 999 and EP-A-0 564 406. The preparation of the catalysts of formula III can be carried out, for example, by reacting a diiridium complex of the formula [IrXZ]2 with a diphosphine Y. The iridium catalysts can be added to the reaction mixture as isolated compounds. It has proved advantageous, however, to produce the catalysts in situ with or without a solvent prior to the reaction and to add optionally a portion or all of the acid and of an ammonium or alkali metal halide.<br>
The molar ratio of imine to iridium catalyst may be, for example, from 5 000 000 to 10, especially from 2 000 000 to 20, more preferably from 1 000 000 to 100, and more especially from 1 000 000 to 1000.<br>
The molar ratio of imine to hydrogen iodide is, for example, from 1 000 000 to 100, preferably from 500 000 to 500, more especially from 10 000 to 1000.<br>
In a preferred procedure, the ratio of hydrogen iodide to iridium is from 200 to 1.<br>
The process is carried out preferably at a temperature of from -20 to 100°C, especially from 0 to 80°C and more especially from 10 to 70°C, and preferably at a hydrogen pressure of 2 x 105 to 1.5 x 107 Pa (5 to 150 bar), especially 106 to 107 Pa (10 to 100 bar).<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the absence or in the presence of solvents. Examples of suitable solvents, which can be used alone or as a mixture of solvents, are:<br>
aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclo-hexane, benzene, toluene and xylene; ethers, such as diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane; halogenated hydrocarbons, such as methyl-ene chloride, chloroform, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane and chlorobenzene; esters and lactones, such as ethyl acetate, butyrolactone and valerolactone; acid amides and lactams, such as dimethylformamide, dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidone, and ketones, such as acetone, dibutyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and methoxyacetone.<br>
Hydrogen iodide can be added in gaseous form or in the form of an aqueous solution or in the form of any solution. In some cases it may be advantageous to operate under<br>
anhydrous conditions.<br>
In detail, the process according to the invention can be carried out by first preparing the catalyst by dissolving, for example, (Ir-dieneCl)2 and a diphosphine in a solvent or a portion of the substance to be hydrogenated; then hydrogen iodide (in gaseous form or in the form of an aqueous solution) and imine (optionally in the form of a solution) are added. The mixture is hydrogenated in an autoclave and the reaction mixture is isolated and purified in a manner known per se, for example by precipitation, extraction or distillation. Prior to the hydrogenation it is expedient to operate under an inert gas. It is advantageous to ensure that the catalyst solution stands for only a short time, and to carry out the hydrogenation of the imines as soon as possible after the preparation of the catalyst solution.<br>
In the case of the hydrogenation of aldimines and ketimines, the aldimines and ketimines can also be formed in situ before or during the hydrogenation. In a preferred form, an amine and an aldehyde or a ketone are mixed together and added to the catalyst solution and the aldimine or ketimine formed in situ is hydrogenated. It is also possible, however, to use an amine, a ketone or an aldehyde together with the catalyst as the initial batch and to add the ketone or the aldehyde or the amine thereto, either all at once or in metered amounts.<br>
The hydrogenation can be carried out continuously or batchwise in various types of reactor. Preference is given to those reactors which allow comparatively good intermixing and good removal of heat, such as, for example, loop reactors. That type of reactor has proved to be especially satisfactory when small amounts of catalyst are used.<br>
The process according to the invention yields the corresponding amines in short reaction times while having chemically a high degree of conversion, with surprisingly good optical yields (ee) of 70 % or more being obtained even at relatively high temperatures of more than 50°C, and even with high molar ratios of imine to catalyst.<br>
The hydrogenated organic compounds that can be prepared in accordance with the invention, for example the amines, are biologically active substances or are intermediates for the preparation of such substances, especially in the field of the preparation of pharma-ceuticals and agrochemicals. For example, o,o-dialkylarylketamine derivatives, especially those having alkyl and/or alkoxyalkyl groups, are effective as fungicides, especially as<br>
herbicides. The derivatives may he amnie salts, aeid amides, tor example of chloroacetic acid, tertiary amines and ammonium salts (see, for example, EP-A-0 077 755 and EP-A-0 115470).<br>
Especially important in this connection are the optically active amines of formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which can be prepared from the imines of formula (V) in the presence of asymmetric iridium catalysts using the processes according to the invention, wherein R01, R02 and R03 are each independently of the others C1-C4alkyl, and R04 is C1-C4alkyl or C1-C4alkoxy-methyl or C1-C4alkoxyethyl, and especially the amines of formulae<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
which can be prepared from the imines of formulae (Va) and (Vb) and which can be converted in accordance with methods that are customary per se with chloroacetic acid into the desired herbicides of the chloroacetanilide type; of those compounds, special preference is given to those having the S-configuration at the asymmetric C* atom.<br>

is determined by gas chromatography [DB 17/30 W column (15 m), manufacturer: JCW<br>
