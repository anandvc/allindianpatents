wherein R1, R2, R5 and R5 are as defined in formula I, and each of R, R' and R" is a protecting group; and recovering the resulting compound of formula I in free or salt form.<br>
The process may be performed according to methods known in the art, for example by base-or acid-catalysed hydrolysis, e.g. as described in the examples.<br>
Protecting groups, their introduction and removal are described, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", T. W. Greene et a!., John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., Second Edition 1991. Preferably each protecting group, e.g. the amino protecting group R and/or one or both of the hydroxy protecting groups R' and R", is acyl, e.g. a residue Ry-CO- wherein Ry is C1-4 alkyl, C1-4cycloalkyl, phenyl or phenyi-C1-4alkyl, e.g. acetyl.<br>
Where required, the compound of formula I obtained in free form may be converted into the desired salt form, or vice versa.<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein R, R',  R", R1f R2 and R5 are as defined above, isomers of compounds of formula V formed by this process, in which the halogen atom is attached to the benzene ring at alternative positions, may be separated by standard procedures, e.g. column chromatography. Preferably the bromination with N-bromosuccinimide is earned out at room temperature.<br>
The compounds of formulae III to V are intermediates useful in the production of the compounds of formulae I and I) and also form part of the present invention. The compounds formulae VI and VII are known or may be produced in accordance with known procedures.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention.<br><br>

The compounds of formula I, in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, exhibit valuable pharmacological properties, e.g. agonism of S1P receptors, e.g. as indicated in in vitro and in vivo tests and are therefore indicated for therapy.<br>
A. Binding affinity of S1P receptor agonists to individual human S1P receptors<br>
Transient transfection of human S1P receptors into HEK293 cells<br>
S1P receptors and 1j proteins are cloned, and equal amounts of 4 cDNAs for the EDG receptor, G1-α, G1-β and G1-γ are mixed and used to transfect monolayers of HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitate method (M. Wigler et al., Cell. 1977;11;223 and DS. Irri et a!., Mo!. Pharmacol. 2000;57;753). Briefly, a DNA rnixiuie containing 25 pg of DNA and 0.25 M CaCI is added to HEPES-buffered 2 mM Na2HP04. Subconfluent monolayers of HEK293 cells are poisoned with 25 mM chloroquine, and the DNA precipitate is then applied to the cells. After 4 h, the monolayers are washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed media (90% 1:1 Dulbecco's modified essential media (DMEM):F-12 + 10% fetal bovine serum). The cells are harvested 48-72 h after addition of the DNA by scraping in HME buffer (in mM: 20 HEPES, 5 MgCI2,1 EDTA, pH 7.4) containing 10% sucrose on ice, and disrupted using a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 800xg, the supernatant is diluted with HME without sucrose and centrifuged at 100,000xg for 1h. The resulting pellet is rehomogenized and centrifuged a second hour at 100,000xg. This crude membrane pellet is resuspended in HME with sucrose, aliquoted, and snap-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. The membranes are stored at 70°C. Protein concentration is determined spectroscopically by Bradford protein assay.<br>
GTPyS binding assay using S1P receptor/HEK293 membrane preparations<br><br>
GTPyS binding experiments are performed as described by DS. Im et al., Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57:753. Ligand-mediated GTPyS binding to G-proteins is measured in GTP binding buffer (in mM: 50 HEPES, 100 NaCI, 10 MgCl2, pH 7.5) using 25 pg of a membrane preparation from transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Ligand is added to membranes in the presence of 10 pM GDP and 0.1 nM [35S]GTPyS (1200 Ci/mmol) and incubated at 30°C for 30 min. Bound GTPyS is separated from unbound using the Brandei harvester (Gaithersburg, MD) and counted with a liquid scintillation counter.<br>
B.     In vivo: Blood Lymphocyte Depletion<br>
A compound of formula ! or the vehicle is administered orally by gavage to rats. Tail blood for hematological monitoring is obtained on day-1 to give the baseline individual values, and at 2, 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after application. In this assay, the compounds of formula I deplete peripheral blood lymphocytes when administered at a dose of 0.03 to 3 mg/kg.<br>
The compounds of formula I are therefore useful as sphingosine-1 phosphate (SIP) receptor agonists or antagonists for:<br>
a)	treatment and prevention of organ or tissue transplant rejection, for example for the treatment of the recipients of heart, lung, combined heart-lung, liver, kidney, pancreatic, skin or corneal transplants, and the prevention of graft-versus-host disease, such as sometimes occurs following bone marrow transplantation; particularly In the treatment of acute or chronic alio- and xenograft rejection or in the transplantation of insulin producing cells, e.g. pancreatic islet cells;<br>
b)	treatment and prevention of autoimmune disease or of inflammatory conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, hashimoto's thyroidis, multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, diabetes type I or II and the disorders associated therewith, vasculitis, pernicious anemia, Sjoegren syndrome, uveitis, psoriasis, Graves ophthalmopathy, alopecia areata and others, allergic diseases, e.g. allergic asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis, allergic contact dermatitis, inflammatory diseases optionally with underlying aberrant reactions, e.g. inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, intrinsic asthma, inflammatory lung injury, inflammatory liver injury, inflammatory glomerular injury, atherosclerosis, osteoarthritis, irritant contact dermatitis and further eczematous dermatitises, seborrhoeic dermatitis, cutaneous manifestations of immunologtcally-mediated disorders, inflammatory eye disease, keratoconjunctivitis, myocarditis or hepatitis.<br><br>
For the above uses the required dosage will of course vary depending on the mode of administration, the particular condition to be treated and the effect desired. In general, satisfactory results are indicated to be obtained at daily dosages of from about 0.1 to about 100 mg/kg body weight. An indicated daily dosage in the larger mammal, e.g. humans, is in the range of from about 0.5 mg to 2000 mg, conveniently administered, for example, in divided doses up to four times a day or in retard form.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be administered by any appropriate route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of a tablet or capsule, topically or parenterally, for example intravenously. Pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula I in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form in association with at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent may be manufactured in conventional manner by mixing with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Unit dosage forms for oral administration contain, for example, from about 0.1 mg to about 500 mg of active substance.<br>
Compounds of formula I may be administered in free form or in pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, e.g. as indicated above. Such salts may be prepared in conventional manner and exhibit the same order of activity as the free compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be administered as the sole active ingredient or together with other drugs in immunomodulating regimens or other anti-inflammatory agents e.g. for the treatment or prevention of allograft acute or chronic rejection or inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. For example, they may be used in combination with calcineurin inhibitors, e.g. cyclosporin A, cyclosporin G, FK-506, ABT-281, ASM 981; an mTOR inhibitor, e.g. rapamycin, 40-O-(2-hydroxy)ethyl-rapamycin, CCI779, ABT578 or AP23573 etc.; corticosteroids; cyclophosphamide; azathioprene; methotrexate; another S1P receptor agonist, e.g. FTY 720 or an analogue thereof; leflunomide or analogs thereof; mizoribine; mycophenolic acid; mycophenolate mofetil; 15-deoxysperguaIine or analogs thereof; immunosuppressive monoclonal antibodies, e.g., monoclonal antibodies to leukocyte receptors, e.g., MHC, CD2, CD3, CD4, CD 11a/CD18, CD7, CD25, CD 27, B7, CD40, CD45, CD58, CD 137, ICOS, CD150 (SLAM), OX40, 4-1BB or their ligands, e.g. CD154; or other immunomodulatory compounds, e.g. a recombinant binding molecule having at least a portion of the extracellular domain of CTLA4 or a mutant thereof, e.g. an at least extracellular portion of CTLA4 or a mutant thereof joined to a noi&gt;CTLA4 protein sequence, e.g. CTLA4lg (for ex. designated ATCC 68629) or a mutant thereof, e.g. LEA29Y, or other adhesion molecule inhibitors, e.g. mAbs or low molecular weight inhibitors including LFA-1 antagonists, Selectin antagonists and VLA-4 antagonists.<br><br>
Where a compound of formula I is administered in conjunction with another immunomodulating or anti-inflammatory agent, dosages of the co-administered immunomodulating or anti-inflammatory agent will of course vary depending on the type of co-drug employed, on the condition to be treated and so forth.<br>
