Method for producing polyalkenyl succinimide products, novel polyalkenyl succinimide products with improved properties, intermediate products and the use thereof<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular<br>
polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, novel polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, having improved properties, polyisobutenylsuccinic monoester intermediates and their use in the novel process for the preparation of polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, a process for the preparation of the intermediates, and the use of the polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular<br>
polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, as additives for fuels or lubricants.<br>
The preparation of polyalkenylsuccinimide, for example a polyisobutenylsuccinimide, from a polyolefin, e.g. polyisobutene, and maleic anhydride with formation of a polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, e.g. a polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, and subsequent imidation is described in the prior art, cf. for example EP-A-264247 or EP-A-271937. Thus, EP-A-264247 describes, on page 4, the reaction of maleic anhydride with an olefinic polymer, for example polyisobutene, by heating in an ene reaction with formation of  a polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, which can then be reacted with a polyamine to give the corresponding polyisobutenylsuccinimide (cf. also example 1 of the publication).<br>
EP-A-271937 describes the preparation of polyolefin-substituted succinimides, in particular of polyisobutene-substituted succinimides. Here, the polyalkene or halogenated polyalkei^ is reacted with maleic anhydride at from 140 to 220^0, preferably in the presence of chlorine, and the resulting product is then reacted with the polyamine.<br>
The reactions described in the prior art are generally carried out according to the following reaction scheme, shown for polyisobutenylsuccinimide by way of example.<br><br>
Reaction scheme:<br>
Synthesis of polyisobutenylsuccinimide (PIBSI) according to the<br>
prior art, EP-A-264247<br><br>
The polyalkenylsuccinimides described in the prior art are widely used, usually in combination with other additives, in fuels and lubricants, cf. for example EP-A-264247, pages 8/9, EP-A-271937 . and WO 98/42808 to mention but a few examples.<br>
Thus, WO 98/42808 describes the use of a reaction product of a polyalkenyl derivative of a monoethylenically unsaturated C4-Cio-dicarboxylic acid with a polyamine as a dispersant additive for low-sulfur diesel fuels. These may be reaction products of polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride and polyamines.<br>
EP-A-839840 proposes succinimide compounds obtained from a succinic acid provided with an alkenyl or alkyl group as a side chain, or the corresponding anhydride, and a polyamine. These compounds are said to act as lubricant additives and counteract corrosion of diesel fuels having a high sulfur content. The side chain may be, for example, a polyisobutene. The reaction of the acid component with the polyamine takes place in a molar ratio of acid component to polyamine of 2.0 or more.<br>
The succinimide compounds are characterized by two infrared absorption bands, an a-peak at 1640 ± 10 cm~i and a P-peak at 1700 ± 10 cm-l, with an a-peak:P-peak intensity ratio of 0.12 or more- Since it is known, for example, that the position of the infrared absorption band and in particular the relative intensities are highly dependent on the measuring conditions, and the publication makes no mention of this, it is not possible to determine the products in this publication.<br><br>
The literature also describes the preparation of polyalkenylsuccinimides,   for example polyisobutylsuccinimides, and other, aftertreated additives for lubricating oils and fuels, starting from olefins and unsaturated acid components, for example maleic anhydride, or functional acid derivatives in which the radicals located at the carbonyl function may be OH, CI or 0-lower alkyl (cf. EP-A-657475). However, this publication clearly concentrates on the use of the anhydride, especially since all examples describe the use of maleic anhydride in the reaction with the polyolefin.<br>
The same applies to EP-A-441014 and EP-A-587331, in which the examples are likewise restricted to the use of maleic anhydride.<br>
None of the publications specifically mentions monoesters of polyisobutenylsuccinic acid.<br>
US-A-5279626 describes fuel additives which may contain reaction products of polyamines with hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic acid acylating agents. These include, the anhydrides, acid halides and esters (column 5). No mention is made of monoesters in the publication. However, US-A-527 9626 (cf. column 6) recommends the additional use of corrosion inhibitors, including monoesters of alkenylsuccinic acids having 8 to 24 carbon atoms in the alkenyl group with alcohols, such as polyglycols.<br>
In the course of the present invention, it was found that, in the preparation of polyalkenylsuccinimides, in particular of polyisobutenylsuccinimide, a considerable volume increase unexpectedly occurs in the reactor during the stage in which polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular<br>
polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, is reacted with an oligoamine or polyamine. This is based, on the one hand, on the elimination of water or steeim and, on the other hand, on an evidently large intermediate viscosity increase, which occurs when the polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular<br>
polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, is combined with the oligoamine or polyamine component. This volume increase is the limiting factor in determining the batch size in an existing plant. According to the Applicant's observation based on this phenomenon, the plant can as a rule be filled to only 60% of the theoretical capacity. This means that, in order to achieve specific batch sizes, production plants are required which, owing to the frothing of the mixture of starting materials, have to have a substantially larger capacity than would be required without the occurrence of the frothing phenomenon.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve the known process for the preparation of a polyalkenylsuccinimide, in particular a polyisobutenylsuccinimide, by reacting a polyolefin, i.e. polyisobutene, with maleic acid, maleic anhydride or the functional derivatives thereof to give a polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular a polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, and then reacting the polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, with an oligoamine or polyamine, so that the frothing of the mixture of starting materials comprising polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, and the oligoamine or polyamine is prevented or at least greatly reduced. It is clear that the polyolefin used in the preparation of the polyalkenylsuccinanhydride has terminal double bonds, in paticular double bonds of a vinylidene structure, which may undergo an ene-reaction together with the maleic acid anhydride. The amount of terminal double bonds in the polyolefin is, thus, in general at least 50 mol% and in particular at least 75 mol% (as determined with ^H-NMR spectroscopy and if desired in combination with ^^C-NMR spectroscopy in a known manner).<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by a process of said type, wherein a polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular a polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, is either<br>
(a)	first reacted with an alcohol or phenol and, without isolation of the reaction product, then with the oligoamine or polyamine, or<br>
(b)	the polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, is reacted with the oligoamine or polyamine in the presence of an alcohol or phenol and<br>
(c)	if desired, the alcohol or the phenol is then removed.<br>
Surprisingly, there is no frothing of the mixture of the starting materials in the novel process, so that, for the same batch, it is possible to manage with reactor volumes which are substantially smaller than those required to date. According to bhe novel process, the degree of filling of a plant can be Increased to 85% or more of the maximum capacity, depending on the chosen reaction temperature. This improves the ::ost-efficiency of the process in the long term.<br><br>
anhydride, as an example tor a polyalJcenyisuccinxmide. The data given for polyisobutenylsuccinanhydride correspond to other polyalkenylsuccinanhydrides.<br>
The novel process comprises two variants: either the resulting polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride is first reacted with the alcohol or phenol and the reaction product, without isolation, i.e. in situ or immediately, is then reacted with the oligoamine or polyamine. This can be effected in such a way that the polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride is brought into contact with the alcohol or phenol, the reaction is allowed to take place and the oligoamine or polyamine is then introduced into the reaction space. Isolation of the monoester formed as an intermediate is not necessary. Alternatively, the polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride can be reacted with the oligoamine or polyamine in the presence of the alcohol or phenol.<br>
\fter the reaction, the alcohol or the phenol can, if desired, be removed in a conventional manner - However, this is not essential and can also advantageously be dispensed with.<br>
The reaction of the polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride with the ilcohol or phenol is expediently effected at elevated :emperatures, preferably at from 50 to ISO^C, in particular from 30 to 160OC.<br>
[•he novel process not only surprisingly solves the problem of frothing of the mixture of starting materials. The resulting )olyalkenylsuccinimide products also differ in their properties :rom the polyalkenylsuccimides of the prior art. The relatively .arge amount of corresponding amides always obtained in the known )rior art processes is substantially reduced. In addition, the lovel polyalkenylsuccinimide products contain no ester fractions, Llthough the reaction with the alcohol or phenol was carried out .n an intermediate stage.<br>
'he polyalkenylsuccinimide products and in particular the novel ►olyisobutenylsuccinimides obtained according to the invention LOt only have a different composition to the<br>
tolyisobutenylsuccinimides of the prior art but also surprisingly lave superior properties compared with the known products. iFor ixcimple, the dispersant effect is substantially improved. When hey are used in fuel, this is evident from a lower degree of oking of the injection/burner nozzles- The substantial .mprovement in the dispersant effect is also found when the novel<br><br>
polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular the polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, are used as additives for lubricants - Furthermore, the novel polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular the polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, i are particularly effective for protection from corrosion and wear.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention furthermore relates to the provision of novel polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular I the polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, having superior properties.<br>
The novel polyalkenylsuccinimide products, in particular the polyisobutenylsuccinimide products, are obtainable by a process in which a polyolefin, particularly a polyisobutene having terminal double bonds, is reacted with maleic acid, maleic anhydride or a functional derivative thereof to give a polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, and the polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride or a functional derivative thereof is then reacted with an oligoamine or polyamine, polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride or its functional derivative either<br>
(a)	first being reacted with an alcohol or phenol and then, without isolation of the reaction product, with the oligoeimine or polyamine, or<br>
(b)	the polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride or its functional derivative is reacted with the oligoamine or polyamine in the presence of an alcohol or phenol and<br>
(c)	if desired, the alcohol or the phenol is then removed.<br>
The novel polyalkenylsuccinimide products obtained from a polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride or a functional derivative thereof and an oligoamine or polyamine contain not more than 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the product mixture, of the corresponding polyalkenylsuccincimide or polyalkenylsuccinic acid monoamide. Preferably, the amount of the corresponding polyalkenylsuccinamide or monoamide is not more than 25% by weight, based on the total weight of the product.<br>
The quantitative determination of the cimount of<br>
polyalkenylsuccinamide or polyalkenylsuccinic acid monoamide or polyalkenylsuccinimide in the novel product is carried out by the IR method explained below:<br><br>
A quantitative determination of imide and amide substituents in the novel polyalkenyl derivative can be effected, for example, on the basis of the IR bands. With the chosen apparatus and under the chosen experimental conditions, these are at 1703 cm-i (imide) and 1666 cm"^ (amide), and the reference band for polyisobutylene is at 1367 cm-^.<br>
The spectrometer used was a Nicolet Magna 550 (mesuring parameter: resolution 4 cm*^). The sample was applied as a thin film on a KBr window for the measurement.<br>
Evaluation:<br>
The determination of the extinction (band height) at the abovementioned wave numbers is carried out with the aid of a baseline with reference points 1807 cm-^ and 1045 cm-^. By calculating the quotient extinction (1666 cm-i) / extinction (1703 cm-^), it "is possible to specify only a relative amide / imide ratio since the amide and imide bands at the same concentration do not have the same intensity (different oscillator strength or excitation probability of imide and amide vibration).<br>
On the basis of two samples having different imide/cunide ratios, it is possible, by spectral subtraction, to obtain spectra which contain either only the imide or the cimide band plus the isobutylene groups associated with the substituent. The 2nd spectrum is weighted in such a way that the band of the respective other substituent is compensated (zero line). This gives an artificial polyisobutylene (PIE)-amide or PIB-imide spectrum. Any free unsubstituted PIB fractions contained in the Scimple result in additional absorptions at the PIB reference band at 1367 cm-i in these artificial spectra. If, for example, the imide spectrum thus obtained (plus said free PIB groups) is subtracted from an "original" sample spectrum, this only contains the vibration band which belong to the amide-substituted PIB. In 3rder to obtain the spectral component of the imide-substituted PIB, the artificial PIB-eunide spectrum must accordingly be subtracted from the sample spectrum.<br>
Cn the spectral components thus obtained for the imide- or imide-substituted PIB, the ratios<br>
Rl = extinction (amide band) / extinction (polyisobutylene) ■ind<br><br>
R2 = extinction (imide band) / extinction (polyisobutylene)<br>
can now be determined by evaluating the band. As a result of the synthesis, both the amide-substituted and imide-substituted PIB have the same chain length (20 isobutylene units) so thatr on standardization of the amide-substituted and imide-substituted PIB spectra to the 1367 cm-^ band, the extinction ratio E(1703 cm-M / E(1666 cm-^) gives the factor by which the imide group is more intense than the amide group when detected by IR spectroscopy. The same is obtained computationally if R2 is divided by Rl.<br>
On the basis of representative samples, this (detection) factor was determined as F(I/A)=1.23. This value means that, at the same concentration, the imide band is about 23% higher than the amide band. If the relative amide/imide ratio mentioned at the outset is multiplied by this factor, the absolute ratio of these two functional groups in the sample to be analyzed is obtained:<br>
Amide/imide ratio<br>
= R = 1.23 * extinction (1666 cm-i) / extinction (1703 cm-^) (1)<br>
From the amide/imide ratio R = A / I according to formula (I), it is now possible to calculate the respective amide and imide content:<br><br><br>
* According to above IR spectroscopic method<br>
1)	PIBSA = Polyisobutyleneamine<br>
2)	TETA = Tetraethylenepentamine<br>
3)	TEPA = Triethylenepentamine<br>

Particularly preferred novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products are those obtained from<br>
(i) polyisobutene having a number average molecular weight Mn of )    from 500 to 10 000 Dalton and a content of terminal double bonds of more than 50, preferably more than 75, mol %<br>
( ii) maleic anhydride and<br>
(iii) a linear, branched, cyclic or cyclic branched<br>
alkylenepolyamine having 1 to 10 carbon atoms in each alkylene group and 2 to 12 nitrogen atoms, of which at least one nitrogen atom is present as a primary amino group, or mixtures thereof,<br>
containing not more than 30% by weight, based on the total weight of the product, of the corresponding polyisobutenylsuccinamide.<br>
Very particularly preferred novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products are those obtained from<br>
(i) polyisobutene having a number average molecular weight Mn of from 500 to 10 000 Dalton and a content of terminal double bonds of more than 50, preferably more than 75, mol %,<br>
(ii)maleic anhydride and<br>
(iii) an oligoamine or polyamine of the formula I:<br>
H2N{CH2)x-NH-[(CH2)y-NH]z-{CH2)xNH2  (I),<br>
where x a-nd y, independently of one another, are each an integer from 1 to 5, preferably from 2 to 4, and ^    is an integer from 0 to 8.<br>
The present invention also relates to novel polyisobutenylsuccinic acid monoester intermediates obtained from<br>
(i) polyisobutene having a number average molecular weight Mn of from 500 to 10 000 Dalton and a content of terminal double bonds of more than 50, preferably more than 75, mol %,<br><br>
(li)maieic annydride and<br>
(iii) alcohols of the formula ROH, where R is straight-chain or branched, cyclic or branched cyclic alkyl of 1 to 16 carbon atoms, or phenols.<br>
The novel polyisobutenylsuccinic acid monoester intermediates occur in the novel process for the preparation of polyisobutenylsuccinimide products and can, if desired, also be isolated. They are not only useful intermediates but, alone or in combination with other additives, can also be used as additives for fuels or lubricants.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of polyisobutenylsuccinic acid monoester intermediates, in which a polyisobutene having terminal double bonds or whose content of terminal double bonds is at least 50 mol%, particularly at least 75 mol%, is reacted with the maleic acid, maleic anhydride or a functional derivative thereof, wherein the resulting polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride is reacted with the alcohol.<br>
The present invention also relates to the use of the polyisobutenylsuccinic acid monoester intermediates in the novel process for the preparation of polyisobutenylsuccinimide products.<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to the use of the novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products as additives for fuels, in particular diesel fuels, kerosine or middle distillates generally, heating oil and gasoline fuel, or lubricants.<br>
According to the invention, diesel fuel additive mixtures, gasoline fuel additives and lubricant compositions are also provided, each of which contains an effective amount of novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products.<br>
rhe novel process is explained in more detail below.<br>
For the preparation of the polyolefin-succinic anhydride, in particular polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride (PIBSA), in the first stage, it is expedient to start from a polyolefin (polyalkene), Eor exainple polyisobutene, and a monounsaturated acid, the corresponding anhydride or ester, preferably maleic anhydride. In in ene reaction, the polyolefin undergoes an addition at the iouble bond of the acid component.<br><br>
A particularly suitable polyolefin is polyisobutene (PIB). Polyisobutenes are described in the prior art. For example, DE-A-4319672 describes a process for the preparation of polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride for polyisobutene and maleic i anhydride, in which polyisobutene containing at least 50% of terminal double bonds is reacted with excess maleic anhydride at from 140 to 200oc.<br>
In principle, polyisobutenes having a very broad number average molecular weight Mn of from 350 to 20 000 Dalton can be used in the novel process-<br>
Polyolefins, in particular polyisobutenes, having a number average molecular weight range (Mn) of from 500 to 10 000, preferably from 500 to 5 000, are particularly preferred. Polyisobutenes of this molecular weight range are prepared, for example, according to US-A-5137980, EP-A-145235 or US-A-5068490. Oligopropenes or polypropenes can preferably be obtained via metallocene catalysis and are described, for example, in . EP-A-490454. Oligoolefins and polyolefins of the butenes, pentenes, hexenes and decenes and copolymers of olefin mixtures which may also contain up to 70 mol % of ethylene, are also of particular interest. The homo- and copolymers of the 1-olefins via metallocene catalysis are also particularly preferred.<br>
Polyolefins having high contents of terminal vinyl or vinylidene double bonds, i.e. those which have more than 50 mol%, preferably more than 70 mol%, of terminal double bonds, are preferred. The dispersity D (Mw/Mn) of the polymers used is preferably less than 3. Narrow distributions are preferred. Dispersity is understood as meaning the quotient of the weight average molecular weight M^ divided by the number average molecular weight Mn- For example, polyisobutene having distributions of less than 2.0 for 
Particularly suitable polyisobutenes are in particular highly reactive polyisobutenes which have a high content of terminal ethylenic double bonds. Suitable highly reactive polyisobutenes are, for example, polyisobutenes which contain &gt;70, in particular &gt;80, especially &gt;85, mol % of vinylidene double bonds. Polyisobutenes which have uniform polymer backbones are particularly preferred. Uniform polymer backbones are possessed in particular by those polyisobutenes which are composed of at least 85, preferably at least 90, particularly preferably at least 95, % by weight of isobutene units. Such highly reactive<br><br>
polyisobutenes preferably have a number average molecular weight Mn of from 350 to 20 000 Dalton. The highly reactive polyisobutenes can have a polydispersity of 
Particularly suitable highly reactive polyisobutenes are, for example, the Glissopal® grades from BASF Atiengesellschaft, in particular Glissopal 1000 (Mn = 1 000), Glissopal 550 (V 33 (Mn = 550)) and Glissopal 2 300 (Mn = 2 300) and mixtures thereof. Other number average molecular weights can be established in a manner known in principle, by mixing polyisobutenes of different number average molecular weights or by extractive enrichment of polyisobutenes of specific molecular weight ranges.<br>
In novel processes, the polyolefin, in particular polyisobutene can be reacted with maleic acid, maleic anhydride or a functional derivative thereof to give a polyisobutenylsuccinamide. The term functional derivative is understood as meaning those derivatives which lead to the same or a comparable result or product. In the case of maleic acid, functional derivatives include, for example, monoalkyl maleates, dialkyl maleates, maleyl dichloride, maleyl dibromide, maleic acid monoalkyl ester monochloride or maleic acid monoalkyl ester monobromide. The alcohol components used in the case of the maleates are, for example, lower alkyl radicals of, for example, 1 to 6, in particular 1 to 4, carbon atoms, for example methyl or ethyl.<br>
The polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride formed as an intermediate in the novel process may also be present in the form of a functional derivative, for example in the form of a free acid, of a lower alkyl mono- or diester, or of an acid halide (chloride or bromide). The lower alkyl radical in the ester derivative may comprise, for example, 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>
Oligoamines or polyamines are used in the novel process. These may be, for example, alkylenepolyamines, including methylenepolyamines, ethylenepolyamines, butylenepolyamines, propylenepolyamines and pentylenepolyamines. Specific examples of such polyamines include ethylenediamine, triethylenetetramine, propylenediamine, trimethylenediamine, tripropylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, hexaethyleneheptamine, pentaethylenehexcunine and mixtures thereof.<br>
Such polyamines are described in detail in the chapter Ethylene Amines  in Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 2nd Edition, Volume 7, pages 22-37, Interscience Publishers, New York (1965). Such polyamines are particularly expediently<br><br><br>
&gt; Particularly preferred oligoamines or polyamines in the novel process are of the structural formula I:<br>
H2N(CH2)x-NH-[(CH2)y-NH]2-(CH2)xNH2  (I),<br>
I where x ^nd y, independently of one another, are each an integer from 1 to 5, preferably from 2 to 4, and z is an integer from 0 to 8, or mixtures thereof.<br>
The alcohols which can be used in the novel process are preferably monohydric alcohols, but polyhydric alcohols are also suitable.<br>
Monohydric or polyhydric alcohols of 1 to 16 carbon atoms are particularly preferred.<br>
Suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, cyclopropylcarbinol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol, 2-hydroxymethylfuran, amyl alcohol, isoamyl alcohol, vinylcarbinol, cyclohexanol, n-hexanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 2-ethylbutyl alcohol, sec-capryl alcohol, 2-ethylhexanol, n-decanol, lauryl alcohol, isocetyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Preferred alcohols are those of 6 to 16 carbon atoms, 2-ethylhexanol being particularly preferred.<br>
The molar ratio of the polyalkenylsuccinic anhydride, in particular polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride, to alcohol may vary within a wide range. It is not necessary to use stoichiometric amounts of alcohol, and even comparatively small molar amounts of alcohol are sufficient to achieve the advantageous effect of the novel process. An expedient molar PIBSAralcohol ratio is from 10 to 0.5, preferably from 4 to 0.8.<br>
The phenols include phenol, naphthol, {o,p)-alkylphenols, e.g. di-tert-butylphenol, and salicylic acid.<br>
The novel process for the preparation of novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products can be controlled in a suitable manner so that a larger amount of either monosuccinimides or bissuccinimides is formed. The novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products having a higher monosuccinimide content are particularly suitable as additives for fuels (diesel fuel, heating oil, gasoline fuel), while the<br><br>
novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products having a higher content of bissuccinimides are particularly suitable as additives for lubricants. The ratio of monoimides to bisimides formed can be influenced, for example, by the molar ratio of ; polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride to oligoamine or polyamine. The larger the molar amount of polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride in relation to the oligoamine or polyamine, the larger the resulting amounts of novel monosuccinimide, and vice versa.<br>
In order to obtain a high proportion of monosuccinimide, a molar (PIBSA):oligoamine or polyamine ratio of from 0.7 to 1.3, particularly preferably from 0.9 to 1.1, is employed.<br>
In order to obtain a higher proportion of bissuccinimide, a molar PIBSA:oligoamine or polyamine ratio of from 3 to 18, particularly preferably from 2.3 to 1.9, is preferably employed.<br>
The novel polyisobutenylsuccinimide products can be used as additives (additive packets) for fuels, iu particular diesel fuel, heating oil, kerosine or middle distillates generally and gasoline fuel, or lubricants.<br>

\  suitable for lubricant compositions, which contain an	effective<br>
amount of novel products, expediently from 0.1 to 10,	preferably<br>

The novel additive compositions can be used in all conventional gasoline fuels, as described, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry , 5th Edition, 1990, Volume M6, page 719 et seq.<br>
For example, the use in a gasoline fuel having an aromatics content of not more than 42% by volume and a sulfur content of not more than 150 ppm by weight is possible.<br>

Said specifications are determined by conventional methods (DIN EN 228).<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention.<br>
Examples 1 and 2<br>
Prevention of the frothing of the mixture of starting materials<br>
For determining the required reaction volume or the volume increase during the reaction, a graduated 500 ml reaction flask with a stirrer and a likewise graduated riser tube (capacity 200 ml) was filled with 300 g of polyisobutenylsuccinic anhydride (PIBSA) (saponification value SV 95) and 50 g of tetraethylenepentamine. After thorough mixing of the starting materials, the total volume VQ was determined as 375 ml, or a level of 75%, at a temperature of 50^0. The content of the flask was then heated to 140^0 within 20 minutes. The degree of filling of the volume of starting materials was determined at intervals of 3 minutes (without a stirrer or with the stirrer switched off). The additives used in each case (alcohol or solvent) are listed in the table below. In each case the maximum volume increase observed was used for the evaluation.<br><br>

Thus, the batch yield can be increased by about 40% by the novel addition of alcohol in the case of a given reaction container. The volume increase still occurring in the presence of the alcohol can be substantially ascribed to the thermal expansion of the reaction mixture on heating to 140°C.<br>

Results of the engine tests<br>
Engine tests were carried out on a stationary Peugeot diesel engine type XUD 9, 45 kw, 1.9 1 stroke x bore). A low-sulfur diesel fuel according to EN 590, having a detergent content of 300 ppm, was used.<br>
For the comparative example, 300 ppm of a commercial monosuccinimide dispersant were added to a commercial fuel corresponding to DK EN 590. The monosuccinimide dispersant was prepared by a process which was carried out without the novel alcohol addition. PIBSA 1000 and TEPA were used. This preparation<br><br>
process is described in WO 98/12282 and EP-A-271937, respectively-<br>
A 6 hour cycle with variable speed and declining power output was chosen as the test procedure for determining engine deposits. The test was carried out analogously to the methods described in the draft for European standard CEC-PF 023. The cleanliness of the combustion chamber was then quantitatively determined. Deposits on the injection nozzle were determined from the reduction in the flow rate in % according to ISO 4113,<br><br>
