This invention relates to process for the preparation of confoctionory items especially sweetmeats of low Glycemic Index using fructose either in crystal or in syrup form, singly or in combination with or without other nutritive and non nutritive sweeteners without problems of browning especially when prepared or cooked at elevated temperatures or after the preparation at the same time maintaining the desirable organoleptic characteristics. This invention further relates to a novel process for the preparation of fructose syrups of variable viscosity and high consistency, without browning, rendering it stable without decomposing when exposed to elevated temperatures for prolonged period.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Hardboiled confectioneries and/or those-confoctioneries that are processed at elevated temperatures generally use conventional sugar derived out of sugarcane. Examples of these especially in the Asian subcontinent including India are Jangiri, Gulab Jamun, Rasagulla, Laddoo, Sandesh, etc. Such sweets are conventionally prepared using conventional sugar in syrupy - semi syrupy form cooked at elevated temperatures.<br>
Attempts have been made in the past to produce sweets with artificial sweeteners such as Aspartame etc., but have not been widely accepted they result in products with bitter after taste. Further, it has not been possible to prepare artificial sweetener based syrups with desirable consistency and viscosity as they decompose when cooked at elevated temperatures resulting in loss of their characteristics.<br>
Several attempts have been made with natural sugar substitutes such as fructose but they have suffered from problems of undesirable browning due to caramelization when heated to elevated temperatures and browning of sweet meat due to reaction between carbohydrate and  protein. Use of other sugar-based alcohols in the production of sweets MEM have also not been successful as they have been rejected by consumers due to their laxative properties and low levels of sweetness.<br>
Sorbitol as a sugar substitute has however been used in the production of one of the hardboiled sweets based on freshly prepared cottage cheese (paneer in India) in sorbitol syrup called "rasagulla". However, the draw back with Sorbitol is that its Glycemic Index value (Gl) is not low enough for consumption by people who have diabetic tendencies. The sweetness index of sorbitol is significantly lower than that of cane sugar and is therefore less satiating than sugar. Moreover sorbitol has fairly high laxative property and hence is not suitable for general consumption.<br>
Literature has examples in which certain chocolates, ice creams and biscuits have been prepared from a set of nutritive/non-nutritive sweeteners. However, such sweets do not use syrups cooked at elevated temperatures as in the case of the Asian or Indian Sweetmeats.<br>
There is a longstanding need in the sweets industry to produce traditional sweets (of the nature manufactured and consumed in the Indian Subcontinent), with low glycemic index suitable for all consumers and especially for consumers with diabetics or<br><br><br>
with diabetic tendencies, maintaining the same organoleptic, textural and visual properties of sweets conventionally produced using from cane sugar.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a process for the preparation of sweetmeats of low Glycemic Index using fructose singly or in combination with or without other nutritive and non nutritive sweeteners without the problem of browning during or after the processing at elevated temperatures.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide processes for the preparation of fructose syrups of variable viscosity and high consistency, without browning, rendering it stable without decomposing when exposed to elevated temperatures for prolonged period, at the same time maintaining the organoleptic and visual characteristics of sucrose based symps making them suitable for the preparation of sweetmeats of low Glycemic Index.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide confoctionory and- sweetmeat preparations of low glycemic index that include among other ingredients, milk/ cereal/lentil/nut based ingredients and their like, requiring elevated temperatures for cooking, most Importantly ensuring that the product does not brown during or after the preparation of the same.<br>

The invention is now illustrated with a few non-limited examples. Various embodiments of the invention are described as hereunder and it should not be construed that the explanation given here does not limit the scope of the inventbn and include possible modifications as known to the persons skilled in the art.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1.<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of Fructose syrup of the required viscosity without browning. 750 gm of Fructose powder in 1000 ml of Water was heated with and without purging of inert gas. The time '0' was taken from the point of boiling of the<br><br><br>
solution. The colour of the solution was measured at 430nm. As described, controlled heating of fructose in the presence of inert gas helps in the production of fructose syrup without change of the initial colour. Table 1 presents representative data of such an experiment.<br>
Example 2<br>
Five litres of fresh cow's milk was boiled and 200 ml of vinegar (10% solution of acetic add) was added. The milk was curdled and the whey was filtered off. The solid portion i.e. cottage cheese (known as paneer) was made into balls of about 10 to 12 gms by weight. The paneer bails were made into four portions and each portion was separately soaked into a liter of solutions obtained by dissolving 250 grams of sugar alcohols (polyols) such as sorbitol, lactitoi, xyltol, and manitol. The paneer balls, thus obtained, were introduced into the boiling solution. After 10 minutes of boiling, 5 to 7 ml of 10% solution of a herbal extract of sapindus - trifoliatus was added at intervals of 6 to 7 minutes during cooking.<br>
Another aqueous solution was prepared by dissolving 250 gms of fructose in water. This was heated progressively with temperature maintained between 60 and 70 degrees for about 10 minutes till the solution acquired low syrupy consistency. Four separate solutions of the above mentioned quantity and viscosity were prepared.<br>
The paneer bails were removed from each of the polyol solutions and put into the fructose solutions to acquire the desired sweetness.<br>
Example 3<br>
Paneer balls were made as above. 250 gms of fructose was dissolved in 2 litres of water and brought to boiling. During heating, inert gas was bubbled into the liquid and under an inert gas blanket. As the solution reached its boiling point, the paneer bails were introduced into the solution with continuous heating. pH of the solution was monitored and was maintained between 2 to 6.5.<br>
In another lot 1250 gms of fructose was dissolved in 4 Its of water and heated to 60 -70 degrees centigrade for a period of 10 minutes. This solution was added to the solution containing the paneer balls and heating continued for a total period of 20 minutes till the paneer balls acquired the desired sweetness.<br>
Example 4<br>
Paneer balls (cottage cheese balls) made as per example two were cooked in water at boiling point with addition of Sapindus-trifollatus extract keeping the pH between 2 and 6.5. ISOOgms of fructose was dissolved in six litres of water and heated to 60 t 70 degrees. The paneer balls cooked as above were introduced into fructose synjp and allowed to cool.<br>
Example 5<br>
1 kg of fructose was dissolved in 2 litres of water and heated to boiling with nitrogen purging till the syrup attained the desired consistency. The syaip was cooled to room temperature with continuous purging of inert gas. 1/2 kg condensed cooked milk solid<br><br><br>
(khoya) was mixed with maida in desired proportion (approximately 10-20 gms) kneaded and made into balls of 10 - 12 gms each. These balls were deep fried in a fat medium (oil or hydrogenated oil) and taken out of the cooking medium and introduced in the fructose syrup.<br>
Example 6<br>
1.5 kg of fructose was dissolved in water and brought to boiling point with inert gas bubbling and inert gas cover. 100 ml of Sapindus-trifoliatus extract was added. PH was added between 2 and 6.5 and pennitted reducing agents were added. Paneer balls (as prepared in example 2) were added and cooked in fructose solution keeping inert gas bubbling and inert gas cover until the entire process was completed and the product brought to room temperature.<br><br><br><br>
