				<td>Description<br>
Method, base station and subscriber station for channel<br>
coding in a GSM mobile radio system<br>
The invention relates to a method, base station<br>
and subscriber station for channel coding in a GSM<br>
mobile radio system.<br>
The GSM (global system for mobile<br>
communications) mobile radio system is installed in<br>
more than 100 networks and for more than 100 million<br>
subscribers worldwide. In the GSM mobile radio system,<br>
data (for example voice or data within data services<br>
such as SMS or GPRS) are transmitted via a radio<br>
interface with the aid of electromagnetic waves. The<br>
radio interface relates to a connection between a base<br>
station and subscriber stations where the subscriber<br>
stations can be mobile stations or stationary radio<br>
stations. The electromagnetic waves are radiated in<br>
this case with carrier frequencies which are within the<br>
frequency bands of 900, 1800, 1900 MHz in the GSM<br>
mobile radio system.<br>
In mobile radio systems, channel coding is<br>
required for transmitting the data via the radio<br>
interface. This channel coding differs for different<br>
services, e.g. 14.4 kbps data, FR (full-rate) voice, HR<br>
(half-rate) voice. The channel coding and the<br>
complementary channel decoding at the receiving end<br>
have the aim here of achieving the lowest possible bit<br>
error rate (BER).<br>
Hitherto, only nonsystematic nonrecursive<br>
convolutional codes (NSC - nonsystematic convolutional<br>
codes) have been used for channel coding in the GSM<br>
mobile radio system (and other comparable systems). In<br>
these codes, a coded bit is generated from a weighted<br>
sum of the current and past information bits by<br>
convolutional coding. At a coding rate of %, e.g. 2<br>
coded bits, which in each case come from<br>
a differently weighted sum, are thus generated from one information bit (see Figure 2).<br>
The weights in this sum, and thus the generation of the coded bits are determined by<br>
the so-called generator polynomials. Thus, e.g., the polynomial 1 + D3 + D4 determines<br>
that a coded bit is produced from the sum (XOR combination) of the current, the third<br>
last and the fourth last information bit.<br>
The bits coded during the channel coding are transmitted via the radio interface and<br>
channel-decoded at the receiving end. A frequently used decoding algorithm is the so-<br>
called Viterbl algorithm. Since the decoding process remains the same and is also<br>
computationally intensive, hardware chips (application specific integrated circuits<br>
(ASICs) are used for this purpose, especially in base stations. As a rule, these ASICS can<br>
only process a certain decoding scheme, only for nonrecursive currents in the case of<br>
GSM.<br>
In the case of the introduction of a new voice coding message for GSM mobile radio<br>
systems, the methods hitherto proposed for the channel coding, see ETSI SMGll; Tdoc<br>
SMGll 205/98, 159/98 and 147/98, 9.28.98, are exclusively based on nonrecursive<br>
codes in order to ensure compatibility with the existing hardware which is used in<br>
millions. In spite of the involvement of many manufacturers in the development<br>
process, see Tdoc SMGll 205/98, 159/98 and 147/98, of 9.28.98, other types of code<br>
have been considered to be unsuable.<br>
The invention is based on the object of specifying a method for channel coding and<br>
corresponding devices which produce better transmission quality. This object is<br>
achieved in the present invention by channel decoding with successive non-recursive<br>
single steps is performed at the receiving end, and post processing is performed on the<br>
basis of the denominator polynomial after channel decoding with the numerator<br>
polynomial.<br>
According to the invention, it is proposed to use recursive systematic codes (RSC codes)<br>
for the channel coding. These............<br>
differ from the NSC codes in that, e.g. at a rate of %,<br>
the first "coded" bit corresponds to the current<br>
information bit (systematic) and the second coded bit<br>
is produced from the current and past information bits<br>
and past coded bits (recursive). Thus, codes which are<br>
fed back are used, making use of the fact that<br>
recursive systematic codes have distinctly better code<br>
characteristics, and thus also better characteristics<br>
with respect to the error correction, especially at<br>
high bit error rates.<br>
The RSC codes, known from, among others,<br>
E. Offer, "Decodierung mit Qualitätsinformation bei<br>
verketteten Codiersystemen" [Decoding with quality<br>
information in concordinated coding systems], progress<br>
reports, VDI-Verlag, Series 10, Vol. 443, Düsseldorf<br>
1996, p. 21 ff and p. 119 ff, have previously not been<br>
used since they result in changes in the decoding<br>
process and are thus not hardware-compatible. An<br>
introduction of RSC codes in the channel coding did not<br>
appear possible since the installed base stations had<br>
to be retrofitted. This is not the case, in fact, since<br>
the hardware structure can be retained both at "the<br>
transmitting end and at the receiving end and,<br>
nevertheless, RSC codes can be introduced for channel<br>
decoding in the GSM mobile radio system.<br>
It is proposed to perform post-processing on the basis<br>
of the denominator polynomial with parts of the<br>
recursive systematic code after channel decoding at the<br>
receiving end. According to an advantageous further<br>
development of the invention, the decoding process is<br>
performed as previously with decoding of a NSC code,<br>
namely the one which is identical to the nonrecursive<br>
component - the numerator polynomial - of the new RSC<br>
code. After this hardware-compatible decoding, post-<br>
processing follows in which the bits obtained by this<br>
means are again coded with the denominator polynomial.<br>
This post-processing is advantageously performed via<br>
programming means, that is to say in software, which<br>
can be more easily loaded into existing stations later.<br>
The coding of the post-processing is not<br>
computationally expensive and can be performed as an<br>
additional step in every base station. This recoding<br>
provides the exact bits of the data sequence of the<br>
transmitting end.<br>
A recursive decoding which is not possible with<br>
previously installed hardware can be replaced by<br>
decoding into two nonrecursive successive individual<br>
steps. The first step is decoding using the numerator<br>
polynomial of the recursive code and the second step is<br>
a coding using the denominator polynomial of the<br>
recursive code. This makes it possible to reproduce, if<br>
necessary, any systematic recursive codes using<br>
hardware which has already been installed. The first<br>
step corresponds to the previous decoding and the<br>
second step is the post-processing.<br>
The polynomials of identical RSC and NSC codes<br>
will be explained briefly by means of Figures 2 and 3 .<br>
In a typical NSC code (such as, e.g. GSM/TCHFS).<br>
The generator polynomials there are:<br>
Polynomials of the NSC codes: G1 = 1 + D3 + D4<br>
G2 = 1 + D + D3 + D4<br>
An identical RSC code is generated by dividing, e.g. by<br>
G1:<br>
G1 = 1<br>
Polynomials of the RSC code: <br>
These RSC codes have the advantage that lower<br>
bit error rates are possible in the case of core<br>
channels (up to a bit error rate of 10-4) since the<br>
channel error rate is not exceeded due to the uncoded<br>
bits (systematic component). In contrast, the bit error<br>
rate of coded bits can also be greater than the channel<br>
error rate under very poor channel conditions.<br>
According to an advantageous development of the<br>
invention, a priori knowledge is obtained from a<br>
previous detection at the receiving end and this a<br>
priori knowledge is used in a subsequent channel<br>
decoding. During the transmission of coded voice, a<br>
number of voice parameters, and thus bits, change only<br>
rarely or it is also possible to make predictions of<br>
the probable current value from the value these<br>
parameters in the past. If then the received current<br>
value distinctly deviates from the predicted value,<br>
there is a high probability of a transmission error<br>
and, for example, the received value can be replaced by<br>
the predicted value.<br>
This previous knowledge (a priori knowledge) is<br>
introduced in the channel decoder and has previously<br>
been impossible in most cases since the decoding<br>
algorithm had to be modified due to the use of non-<br>
systematic codes. As a rule, the modification was, in<br>
turn, not hardware-compatible. If RSC codes are used,<br>
this a priori knowledge can be introduced quite simply<br>
before the decoding process since some of the received<br>
bits are uncoded. The decoding process itself does not<br>
need to be modified.<br>
As already explained, some of the received bits<br>
are uncoded information bits. If the channel conditions<br>
are good, i.e. no transmission errors are to be<br>
expected, channel decoding can be omitted and only the<br>
information bits are used. The transmission quality can<br>
then be determined as early as before the channel<br>
decoder by advantageously evaluating information from a<br>
channel estimator. After that, a decision is made as to<br>
whether decoding is necessary or not. In subscriber<br>
stations in which the energy consumption is an<br>
essential quality criterion, an essential advantage is<br>
that the channel decoder can be switched off. This<br>
saves power. In addition, the hardware for channel<br>
decoding can be omitted altogether in applications -<br>
e.g. SMS applications for linking in telemetry services<br>
etc.<br>
in which a high transmission quality is always expected.<br>
Due to a nonrecursive decoding followed by coding, it becomes possible to use RSC codes<br>
with the advantages described above in existing GSM mobile radio systems on existing<br>
hardware.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained in greater detail on the basis of<br>
the network structure of the known GSM mobile radio system according to Figure 1 and<br>
referring to the codes according to Figures 2 and 3.<br>
Figure 2 shows a nonsystematic nonrecursive code with memory 4 and rate 1/2,<br>
analogously to G5M/TCHFS,<br>
Figure 3 shows identical recursive systematic convolutionai code with memory 4 and rate<br>
1/2,<br>
Figure 4 shows a flow chart of the coding<br>
Figure 5 shows a flow chart of the decoding.<br>
The GSM mobile radio system shown in Figure 1 consists of a multiplicity of mobile<br>
switching centers MSC which are networked together and, respectively, establish access to<br>
a landline network PSTN. These mobile switching centers MSC are also connected to in<br>
each case at least one base station controller BSC for controlling base stations BS. Each of<br>
these base station controllers BSC, in turn, provides for a connection to at ieast one base<br>
station BS. An operation and maintenance center OMC implements control and maintenance<br>
functions for the mobile radio system or for parts thereof, respectively.<br>
A base station BS can set up a connection to subscriber stations, e.g. mobile stations MS<br>
or other mobile and stationary terminals via a radio interface. Each base station BS forms<br>
at least one radio cell.<br>
Figure 1 shows connections for transmitting user information between a base station.<br>
In the coding methods shown, voice information<br>
is transmitted as user information. The bits of the<br>
voice information are divided into three classes with<br>
respect to the weighting (Class 1a, 1b and 2) in<br>
accordance with their sensitivity to errors. The most<br>
important bits (Class la are additionally protected by<br>
a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) error protection<br>
coding. The bits of Classes la and lb are<br>
convolutionally coded and punctured. In the AMR, the<br>
interleaving of the data after the coding is performed<br>
in accordance with the interleaving arrangements<br>
previously introduced for FR and HR.<br>
Altogether, 14 coding methods are presented in<br>
conjunction with the AMR coder, from which a selection<br>
must be made in accordance with the transmission<br>
conditions. Of these, eight coding modes can be used in<br>
full-rate mode and six coding modes can be used in<br>
half-rate mode.<br>
 An in-band signaling with 2 bits net (4 or,<br>
respectively, 8 bits gross after coding) per frame<br>
(20 ms) is used<br>
for signaling the coding mode or for signaling the<br>
transmission quality in alternating frames. The two<br>
bits can be used for signaling four coding modes. These<br>
coding modes, which can be switched between by means of<br>
the in-band signaling, must be previously selected.<br>
The following order of steps to be performed<br>
applies to all modes:<br>
1. Information of the in-band signaling is coded with<br>
a block code,<br>
2. The user information is sorted in accordance with<br>
their significance (class),<br>
3. The ordered bits of the user information are coded<br>
with a systematic block code (CRC), generating<br>
words with voice and parity bits,<br>
4. These coded bits and the rest of the Class 1 bits<br>
are convolutionally coded,<br>
5. The coded bits are punctured in order to obtain<br>
the desired bit rate,<br>
6. Unprotected bits are inserted into the frame with<br>
punctured data (only for half-rate mode),<br>
7. The bits are reordered and the coded and in-band<br>
bits are interleaved, also inserting a so-called<br>
stealing flag.<br>
The designations used in the [lacuna] have the<br>
following significance:<br>
k, j Numbering of the bits in data block or burst<br>
Kx Number of bits in a block, x specifies data type<br>
n Numbering of the output data blocks<br>
N A selected data block<br>
B Numbering of bursts or blocks<br>
s (k) Voice information before sorting, k=1...Ks<br>
(interface 0 in Figure 4)<br>
d(k) Voice information before channel coding,<br>
k=1...Kd-1 (interface 1 in Figure 4)<br>
id(k) Bits of the in-band signaling, k=0,1<br>
ic (k) Coded bits of the in-band signaling,<br>
k=0...3 (HR), 7 (FR)<br>
u(k) Data after the first coding step,<br>
k=0,1, . . .Ku-1<br>

(interface 2 in Figure 4)<br>
c(n,k), c(k) Data after the second coding step,<br>
k=0,1..Kc-1, n=0,1..N,N+1<br>
(convolutional coding), (interface 3 in Figure<br>
4)<br>
i(B,k) Interleaved data, k=0 , 1. . Kj-1, B=B0, B0 + 1, ..<br>
e(B,k) Bits of a burst, k=0,1,114,115; B=B0, B0+1, ..<br>
(interface 4 in Figure 4)<br>
Coding in full-rate mode (FR)<br>
Coding of the bits of the in-band signaling:<br>
Distribution of the bits to classes:<br>
There are no class 2 bits.<br>
The essential parameters for the coder and<br>
correspondingly for each decoder are specified as<br>
follows for the first coding step:<br>
a) Parity bits:<br>
A 6-bit CRC (cyclic redundancy check) is used for error<br>
detection. These 6 parity bits are generated by using<br>
the following cyclic generator polynomial:<br>
g(D) = D6 + D5 + D3 + D2 + D1 + 1 for the first Kdla bits<br>
of Class 1, Kdla specifying the number of bits of Class<br>
la according to the above table. The coding with the<br>
cyclic code is performed in systematic manner:<br>
in GF(2), the polynomials:<br>
d(0)D(Kdla+5) + d(l)D(Kdla+4) +... + d(Kdla-1)D(6) +<br>
p(0)D(5) +. . .+ p(4)D+ p(5)<br>
where p(0), p(1) ... p(5) are the parity bits<br>
which, divided by g(D), give "0".<br>
b) Tailing bits and reordering<br>
The information bits and parity bits are brought<br>
together and so-called tail bits are appended:<br>
u(k) = d(k) for k = 0, 1, ..., Kdla-1<br>
u(k) = p(k-Kdia) for k = Kdla, Kdla+1, ..., Kdia+5<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = Kdla+6, Kdla+7, ..., Kd+5<br>
u(k) = dependent on coding mode<br>
Thus, the following contents are defined for<br>
each coding mode after the first coding step u(k):<br>
CHO-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k = 0, 1, ...,80<br>
u(k) = p(k-81) for k = 81, 82, ..., 86<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 87, 88, ..., 249<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 250, 251, ..., 254<br>
CH1-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 64<br>
u(k) = p(k-65) for k = 65, 66, ..., 70<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 71, 72, ..., 209<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 210, 211, ..., 214<br>
CH2-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 74<br>
u(k) = p(k-75) for k = 75, 76, ..., 80<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 81, 82, ..., 164<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 165, 166, ..., 170<br>
CH3-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 60<br>
u(k) = p(k-61) for k = 61, 62, ..., 66<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 67, 68, ..., 153<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 154, 155, ..., 159<br>
CH4-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 54<br>
u(k) = p(k-55) for k = 55, 56, ..., 60<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 61, 62, ..., 139<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 140, 141, ..., 145<br>
CH5-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 54<br>
u(k) = p(k-55) for k = 55, 56, ..., 60<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 61, 62, ..., 123<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 124, 125, ..., 129<br>
CH6-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 48<br>
u(k) = p(k-49) for k = 49, 50, ..., 54<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 55, 56, ..., 108<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 109, 110, ..., 114<br>
CH7-FS: u(k) = d(k) for k=0, 1, ..., 38<br>
u(k) = p(k-39) for k = 39, 40, ..., 44<br>
u(k) = d(k-6) for k = 45, 46, ..., 100<br>
u(k) = to be specified for k = 101, 102, ..., 106<br>
Convolutional coder<br>
The bits of the first coding step (u(k)) are<br>
coded with a recursive systematic convolutional code<br>
(see also Figure 4) . The number of output bits after<br>
puncturing and repetition is 448 bits for all modes of<br>
the codina method.<br>
Further details on coding/decoding using<br>
recursive codes were given in C. Berrou, A. Glavieux,<br>
"Near optimum error-correction coding and decoding:<br>
turbo codes" - "Reflections on the prize paper", IEEE<br>
Inf. Theory Soc. Newsletter, vol. 48, No. 2, June 1998<br>
and C. Berrou and A. Glavieux: "Near optimum error-<br>
correcting coding and decoding: turbo codes", IEEE<br>
Trans, on Comm., vol. 44, pp. 1261-1271, October 1996.<br>
The coding modes are presented in sequence:<br>
CHO-FS:<br>
A block of 255 bits {u(0)... u(254)} is coded at the<br>
rate 1/2, using the following polynomials:<br>
G12 = 1<br>
G13 = (1 + D2 + D4 + D5) / (1 + D + D2 + D3 + D5)<br>
The coding with G12 = l means that the input bit<br>
is only multiplied by 1, i.e. is transmitted uncoded.<br>
From each input bit, one output bit is in each<br>
case generated by the coding with G12 or, respectively,<br>
G13. These appear successively at the output of the<br>
coder.<br>
Thus, a serial input sequence of 255 input bits<br>
results in a serial sequence of 510 coded bits<br>
{C(0)... C(509)} at the output of the coder, which is<br>
defined by:<br>
C(2k) = u(k)<br>
C(2k+1) = u(k) +u(k-2) +u(k-4) +u(k-5) +C(2k-1) +C(2k-3) +<br>
C(2k-5) +C(2k-9)<br>
for k = 0, 1, ..., 254; u(k) = 0 for k

The polynomials of the systematic recursive<br>
code (G13 to G17) in the AMR (see Figure 5) shown were<br>
used for two reasons:<br>
they have optimum characteristics for the<br>
puncturing, i.e. the adaptation of the data rate<br>
to the transmission rate of the radio channel, and<br>
numerator or denominator polynomial are in each<br>
case also the polynomial used in the original AMR<br>
channel coding proposal (see Tdoc SMG 147/98). The<br>
necessary changes are thus minimum compared with<br>
the original proposal.<br>
The polynomials used hitherto for voice, data<br>
and signaling information in the GSM system can also be<br>
used for the AMR channel coder with negligible<br>
restrictions in the performance. This can be done<br>
instead of the polynomials described above or as a<br>
complete alternative channel coding arrangement. The<br>
advantage lies in that the compatibility is extended<br>
further since in some cases older pre-existing hardware<br>
components in the channel decoder only allow the<br>
previous GSM polynomials to be used.<br>
Figure 6 shows a base station BS in which, in<br>
the reception case, signals received via an antenna A<br>
are amplified in a receiver, filtered, converted to<br>
baseband and digitized.<br>
This is followed by channel decoding (step 1), which<br>
can be done with decoding devices installed in existing<br>
base stations BS, i.e. the circuit technology can<br>
remain unchanged. This is followed by post-processing<br>
(step 2) of the decoded data which is implemented as a<br>
program. This post-processing consists of convolutional<br>
coding at a rate of 1 with the denominator polynomial<br>
of the respective rate.<br>
As a result, this post-processing is of little<br>
complexity and is performed, for example, by an<br>
additional program in a DSP (digital signal processor).<br>
Referring, e.g. to the rate CHO-FS, this means<br>
that the block with 255 bits at the output of the<br>
decoder must be coded with the polynomial:<br>
G(D) = (1 + D + D2 + D3 + D5)<br>
in order to obtain the 255 original bits. The number of<br>
data bits remains constant, i.e. a current data bit at<br>
the input of this post-processing yields exactly one<br>
original bit with the aid of past input bits.<br>
The coding and decoding methods described can<br>
be used both in base stations BS and in mobile stations<br>
MS.<br>
