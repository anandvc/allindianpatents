Background art<br>
Tertiary hydroxy acids/esters are highly important intermediates in the synthesis of a variety of medicinal agents [(a) Carter, P. J.; Blob, L.; Audia, V. A.; Dupont, A. C.; Mcpherson, D.W.; Natalie Jr, K. J.; Rzeszotarski, W. J.; Spagnuolo, C. J.; Waid, P P.; Kaiser, C. J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 3065; (b) Tambute, A.; Collet, A. Bull, De La Chimi. Fr. 1984, -2,11-77; (c) Kiesewetter, D. 0. Tetrahedron: Asymmetry 1993, 4, 218S; (d) McPherson, D. W.;:Knapp, F. F. J. Org. Chem. 1996, 61,8335] and natural products [(ai) CaWwell, C. G.; Rupprecht, K. M; Bondy, S. S.; Davis, A. A. J. Org. Chem. 1990, 55, 2355; (b) Kanda, Y.; Fukuyama, T. J.Am. Chem. Soc. 1993, 115, 8451]. Cyclohexylphenyl glycolic acid is an important intermediate for the synthesis of oxybutynin (Ditropan), which is a widely prescribedmuscaronic receptor antagonist for the treatment of yrinary frequency, urgency and urge incontinence Yarker. Y. E,; Goa, K. L.; Fitton, A. Drug Aging, 1995,6,243).<br>
In the prior-art the synthesis of cyclohexylphenyl glycolic acid segment of oxybutynin and related tertiary hydroxy esters has been accomplished employing various synthetic strategies.<br><br>
An early synthesis utilizes carbohydrate systems containing an asymmetric benzylic center of known absolute configuration, which on degradation give tertiary hydroxy acids in enantiomerically pure form [Inch, T. D.; Ley, R. V.; Rich, P. J. Chem. Soc. ©, 1968, 1693.<br>
In another prior art method, c/s-aminoindanol or related constrained amino alcohols are used as a highly defined chiral handle for the preparation of enantiopure tertiary a-hydroxy acids via appropriate metal coordinated 1,1-dicarbonyl systems in the Grignard reaction to give tertiary hydroxy acids in 99% enantiomeric purity [Senanayake, C. H.; Fang, K.; Grover, P.; Bakale, R. P.; Vandenbossche, C. P.; Wald, S. A. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999, 40, 819].<br>
In yet another prior art method chiral mandelic acid has been used as a template to generate the tertiary hydroxy acid by Aldol process to give cyclohexylphenyl glycolic acid in greater than 99.9% diastereomeric purity [Grover, P. T.; Bhongle, N. N.; Wald, S. A.; Senanayake, C. H. J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65, 6283]<br>
In still another prior art method the racemic cyclohexylphenyl glycolic acid is resolved via the tyrosine methyl ester to further obtain the cyclohexylphenyl glycolic acid in 99% enantiomeric purity [(a) Bakale, et al. US 6140529, 2000; (b) US 5973182, 1998].<br>
Some	of the major drawbacks of the methods known in the prior-art are such as follows:<br>
(i)	Multi-step synthesis<br>
(ii)	High cost of chiral materials employed<br>
(iii)	Complicated reagents and longer reaction time<br>
(iv)	Difficulties involved in work-up procedure<br>
(v)	Overall low yield of the desired compound<br>
(vi)	Lack of reusability of expensive reagents<br>
