PARA-XYLENE      SELECTIVE      ADSORBENT COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS;<br>
BP CORPORATION NORTH AMERICA INC. A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 4101 WINFIELD ROAD, WARRENVILLE, IL 60555, U.S.A.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
I<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates generally to adsorbent compositions, and in particular to adsorbent compositions which are selective for para-xylene and are useful for vapor-phase adsorption processes.<br>
Brief Description of Related Technology<br>
Hydrocarbon mixtures or fractions containing C8+ aromatics are often by-products<br>
of certain oil refinery, processes., including, but not limited to, catalytic reforming<br>
processes. These hydrocarbon mixtures typically contain up to about 30 weight percent<br>
(wt.%) C9+ aromatics, ;up to about 10 wt.% non-aromatics, up to about 50 wt.%<br>
ethylbenzene, with the balance (e.g., up to about 100 wt.%) being a mixture of xylene<br>
isomers. Most commonly present among the Ca aromatics. are ethylbenzene ("EB"), and<br>
xylene isomers, including meta-xylene ("mX"), ortho-xylene ("oX"), and. para-xylene<br>
("pX").  Typically, when present among the C8 aromatics, ethylbenzene is. present in a<br>
i concentration of up. to about 20wt.% based on the total weight of the C8 aromatics. The<br>
three xylene isomers typically comprise the remainder of the C8 aromatics, and are<br>
typically present at an equilibrium weight ratio of about 1:2:1 (oX:mX:pX,. respectively).<br>
Thus, as used herein, ;the term, "equilibrated mixture of xylene isomers0- refers to. a<br>
mixture containing the isomers, in the weight ratio, of about 1:2:1 (oX:mX:pX).<br>
Efficient separation of the C8 aromatics fraction into its individual constituents is of interest because the individual, isolated C6 'aromatic constituents, are useful commodity chemicals. For example, ethylbenzene is useful in. making, styrenes; meta-xylene Is useful in making, isophthalic acids; ortho-xylene is useful in making phthalic anhydrides; and, para-xylene is useful, formaking terephthalic acids, which are useful for the-synthesis of many commercially important resins, including polyesters such as<br>
polybutene terephthalate polyethylene terephthalate, and polypropylene terephthalate.<br>
i<br>
However, simply separating the C6 aromatics made, available from, a particular source may not provide, sufficient quantities of a desired. C8 aromatic constituent to meet market requirements.   For example, it is generally desirable to increase or maximize<br>
2<br><br>
para-xylene production from a particular C8 aromatic mixture because there is generally a higher demand for para-xylene when compared with the other C8 aromatic constituents. Thus, separation of para-xylene is often coupled with isomerization of the remaining stream containing the meta- and ortho-xylene isomers to convert a portion of the meta- and ortho-xylene isomers to the desired para-xylene by reestablishing the equilibrium between the xylene isomers. Conventional CB aromatic separation methods may further include a method for the conversion of ethylbenzene into benzene, which can be more easily separated from the xylene isomers by distillation.<br>
Typically, such a hydrocarbon mixture is passed through a separation or fractionation column to remove higher boiling C9+ hydrocarbons. A second, lower-boiling fraction can be, removed from a preceding or subsequent column so that the remaining fraction is predominantly a C8 aromatic hydrocarbon mixture.<br>
In general, para-xylene is recovered by subjecting the C8 aromatic mixture to one or more separation steps. Performing fractional distillation on the C8 aromatic mixture is impractical because ethylbenzene, meta-xylene, ortho-xylene, and para-xylene have similar boiling points (falling between about 136°C.and about 144°C). Thus, separation of para-xylene is generally done by crystallization and/or liquid-phase adsorption chromatography.<br>
Crystallization processes exploit the differences in freezing or crystallization temperatures of the various xylenes — para-xylene crystallizes at about 13.3°C while ortho-xylene. and meta-xylene crystallize at about -25.2°C and about -47.9°C, respectively. In the physical system of the three xylene isomers, there are two. binary eutectics of Importance: the para-xylene/meta-xylene binary eutectic and the para-xylene/ortho-xylene binary eutectic. As para-xylene crystallizes from the mixture, the remaining mixture approaches one of these binary eutectics, depending upon the starting composition of the mixture. Therefore, in commercial-scale processes, para-xylene is crystallized such that the binary eutectics are approached — but not reached — to avoid co-crystallization of the other xylene isomers, which would lower the purity of the obtained para-xylene. Because of these binary eutectics, the amount of para-xylene recoverable per pass through a crystallization process is generally no greater than about 65% of the amount of para-xylene present in the stream fed to the crystallization unit Furthermore, crystallization can be very expensive because the various xylene isomers crystallize at very low temperatures.<br>
3<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,329,060 to Swift (July '12, 1994) discloses increasing recovery<br>
of para-xylene by separating the xylene isomers in an adsorption step prior to<br>
crystallization.  Swift discloses that liquid phase adsorption is preferred because of the<br>
reduced temperature requirements and decreased opportunities for side reaction. In the<br>
i adsorption step, a crystalline zeolitic aluminosilicate adsorbent having a silicon to<br>
aluminum ratio between about two and about six selectively adsorbs meta-xylene and<br>
ortho-xylene (or alternatively para-xylene) to provide a para-xylene-enriched stream,<br>
which is subsequently directed to a crystallization apparatus.   The para-xylene lean<br>
stream is generally pressurized and reacted in the presence of an isomerization catalyst<br>
to obtain, an equilibrated mixture of .xylene isomers, which can then be recycled tq the<br>
liquid absorber.<br>
Liquid-phase adsorption chromatography refers to chromatographic processes in which a mixture comes into contact with a stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase. Separation of the mixture components occurs .because of the differences in affinity of the components for the stationary and mobile phases, of the chromatographic system. Liquid-phase adsorption chromatographic separations are typically batch processes. Simulated moving bed adsorption chromatography (SiMBAC) is a continuous operation that utilizes the same, principles to achieve separation. SiMBAC, however, has its limits and is expensive to operate because it requires an internal recycle of large volume(s) of various hydrocarbon desorbent material(s). Additionally, the effluent streams from the adsorption step must be separated from the desirable products in downstream distillation steps. Thus, conventional liquid-phase adsorption chromatographic processes are disadvantageous because of significant capital and energy costs.<br>
It has been found that the foregoing crystallization and SiMBAC steps can be<br>
made more attractive if the feedstock(s) for those steps were reformulated to contain a<br>
higher-than-equilibrium j concentration    of    para-xylene.        Higher-than-equilibrium<br>
i concentrations of para-xylene may be obtained by selective toluene disproportionation<br>
as described in, for example, International (PCT) Publication Nos. WO 00/69796<br>
(November 23,2000) and WO 93/17987 (September 16,1993).<br>
Additionally, crystallization and SiMBAC steps can be designed and operated to concentrate para-xylene: streams for subsequent purification steps. However, such concentration steps typically suffer from many (or all) of the disadvantages previously discussed with respect to crystallization and SiMBAC processes.<br>
4<br><br>
Feedstocks with higher-than-equilibrium para-xylene concentrations may also be<br>
produced by vapor-phase adsorption processes, including pressure swing adsorption<br>
{"PSA") processes.   PSA processes have, been widely practiced for the separation of<br>
gases, such as, air into nitrogen and oxygen, removal of water from air, and hydrogen<br>
purification, and are generally described in Ralph T. Yang, "Gas Separation by<br>
Adsorption   Processes;"    pp.   237-274   (Butterworth   Publishers,    Boston,    1987)<br>
(TP242.Y36). PSA processes generally use a solid adsorbent that preferentially adsorbs<br>
some components from ;a mixture over other components in the mixture. Typically, the<br>
total pressure of the system is reduced to recover the, adsorbate.   In contrast, partial<br>
i pressure swing adsorption (PPSA) operates at a substantially.non-decreasing pressure<br>
and uses an inert gas, such as hydrogen or nitrogen, to purge or sweep the adsorbate<br>
i from the adsorbent. Thus, PPSA processes are based on swings in "partial" pressure,<br>
rather than lowering the total unit pressure, as is traditionally practiced with PSA<br>
processes.    Thermal swing adsorption (TSA) processes are gas-phase adsorption<br>
processes, wherein the adsorbate is recovered by raising the temperature of the<br>
adsorbent bed. Typically; adsorbate recovery is accomplished by purging the bed with a<br>
preheated gas.<br>
Chinese Patent Publication No. 1,136,549 A (November 27, 1996) to Long et al. discloses a method of producing para-xylene by passing a gaseous Ce hydrocarbon mixture through an adsorption bed containing an adsorbent that is selective for para-xylene and ethylbenzene to obtain, after suitable desorption, a stream containing meta-and orthchxylenes and a stream containing para-xylene and ethylbenzene. The adsorption is carried out at a temperature between 140°C and 370°C, a pressure between atmospheric pressure and 300 kilopascals (kPa), and using a Mobij-5 (MFI) type  molecular sieve   adsorbent,   including  ZSM-5  (available  from  ExxonMobil<br>
Chemicals), ferrierite, and silicaJite-1 zeolite, molecular sieves, and in particular, binder-<br>
i<br>
free silicaiite-1 zeolite molecular sieves. The desorption of the para-xylene and ethylbenzene can be carried out with an aqueous vapor desorbent at a temperature within the same range of the adsorption, and at a pressure between atmospheric and 1000 kPa. Alternatively, the desorption can be carried out without a desorbent, and accomplished by mere decompression at a pressure between 1 kPa and 4 kPa.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The invention provides adsorbent compositions for vapor-phase adsorption processes, and adsorption processes selective for para-xylene. Generally, the adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention comprise a molecular sieve material and a binder.<br>
7<br><br>
In one embodiment, the adsorbent compositions comprise a molecular sieve material and a binder, wherein the adsorbent composition has a macropore volume of at least about 0.20 cc/g and a mesopore volume of less than about 0.20 cc/g.<br>
Ranges can be expressed herein as from "about" or "approximately" one particular value and/or to "about" or "approximately" another particular value. When such a range is expressed, another embodiment includes from the. one particular value and/or to the other particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as approximations, by use of the antecedent "about," the particular value forms another embodiment.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the adsorbent compositions comprise a molecular sieve material and a binder selected from the group consisting of clays, silicas, silicates, zirconias,  titanias,   aluminas,   and  aluminum  phosphates,   wherein  the  adsorbent<br>
composition has a volumetric ratio, of macropores to mesopores of at least about 2.<br>
i<br>
In another embodiment, the adsorbent compositions comprise a molecular sieve material, wherein the adsorbent composition has a macropore volume of at least about 0.20 cc/g, the adsorbent composition has a mesopore volume of less than about 0.20 cc/g, and the adsorbent composition has less than about 2 wt.% of materials consisting of gamma-alumina.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the adsorbent compositions comprise a molecular sieve material, wherein the adsorbent composition has a volumetric ratio of macropores to mesopores of at least about 2 and the adsorbent composition has less than about 2<br>
wt.% of materials consisting of gamma-alumina.<br>
i<br>
The invention also, provides methods of making para-xylene selective adsorbents.<br>
In one embodiment according to this aspect of the invention, the method comprises<br>
forming a powder from a composition comprising a molecular sieve material, forming an<br>
aqueous mixture from the powder, extruding the mixture to form an extrudate, and drying<br>
the extrudate to form an adsorbent having a macropore volume of at least about 0.20<br>
i cc/g and a mesopore volume of less than about 0.20 cc/g.<br>
In another embodiment, the method comprises forming a powder from a composition comprising a molecular sieve material, forming an aqueous mixture from the powder, extruding the mixture to form an extrudate, and drying the extrudate to form an adsorbent having a volumetric ratio of macropores to mesopores of at least about 2.    i<br>
8<br><br>
In an additional refinement, the invention provides adsorption processes which<br>
are selective for para-xylene. In one embodiment, the method comprises contacting a<br>
mixture comprising xylene isomers with a para-xylene selective adsorbent comprising a<br>
molecular sieve material and a binder and desorbing from the para-xylene selective<br>
adsorbent an effluent comprising a para-xylene enriched product, wherein the adsorbent<br>
has a macropore volume of at least about 0.20 cc/g and a mesopore volume of less than<br>
about 0.20 cc/g.	i<br>
A formed adsorbent composition (e.g., extrudates or pellets) is typically preferred for commercial applications. Powdered molecular sieve is generally not used as an adsorbent for such separations due to large pressure drop and. bed fluidizatlon.<br>
As used herein, mesopore refers to a pore of an adsorbent in accordance with<br>
the invention which has1 a radius less than about 600 angstroms (A). Analogously, as<br>
used herein, macropore refers to a pore of an adsorbent having a radius in excess of<br>
about 600 A.	!<br>
Adsorbents having a macropore volume of at least about 0.20 cc/g and a mesopore volume of less than about 0.20 cc/g are useful for the subject para-xylene selective adsorption processes. Further, adsorbents having a volumetric ratio of macropores to mesopores of at least about 2 have also been found to be effective for such separations.<br>
Molecular Sieve Materials<br>
i<br>
Preferably, the adsorbents comprise molecular sieve materials that selectively adsorb para-xylene within the channels and pores of the molecular sieve material, while not effectively adsorbing meta-xylene and ortho-xylene (i.e., exclusion of the larger meta-xylene and ortho-xylene or much slower adsorption of the other xylene isomers compared to para-xylene).  Molecular sieve materials useful for the separation of para-<br>
xyiene or of para-xylene and ethylbenzene from mixed xylenes or a mixture of C8<br>
i<br>
aromatics, respectively, have been described in U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0107427 (July 10/'2001), "the entire disclosure of which is hereby, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Generally, the term "molecular sieve" includes a wide variety of natural and synthetic crystalline porous materials having channels, cages, and cavities of molecular<br>
9<br><br>
dimensions. Molecular sieves include aluminosilicates (zeolites), aluminophosphates, and related materials such as silicoaluminophosphates. Aluminosilicates (zeolites) are typically based on silica tetrahedra in combination with other tetrahedrally substituted elements such as aluminum, boron, titanium, iron, gallium, and the like. Aluminophosphates are based on phosphate tetrahedra in combination with other tetrahedrally substituted elements such as aluminum.<br>
Representative! aluminosilicates for use in the adsorbent compositions  in i accordance with the invention can be described by the following unit cell formula (I):<br>
Mxfti[(A)x(3)y02x + 2y]. Wherein M is a compensating cation, n is the cation valence, A is a<br>
Group IIIA element, B is a Group IVA element, and y/x is at least about one.<br>
Representative Group IIIA elements include trivalent elements, such as, for example,<br>
boron, aluminum, and gallium. Representative Group IVA elements include tetravafent<br>
elements, such as, for example, silicon and germanium. Titanium is another tetravalent<br>
element that can be substituted into the aluminosilicate framework structure, and thus,<br>
can be considered to be a Group IVA element, with respect to the above unit cell<br>
formula.   Typically, the Group IIIA element is aluminum and the Group IVA element is<br>
silicon.<br>
Aluminosilicate molecular sieves can be considered as. originating from a Si02<br>
(silica) lattice. Substitution of Group IIIA elements, such as, for example, aluminum, for<br>
silicon in the aluminosilicate molecular sieve structure produces a negative framework<br>
charge, which must be balanced with a compensating cation.   When a Group IIIA<br>
element is substituted in the molecular sieve framework, the sieve should be exchanged<br>
with a non-acidic counter-ion, such as sodium, to provide a substantially non-acidic<br>
sieve.    Suitable molecular sieves are preferably substantially non-acidic because<br>
adsorbent-compositions in accordance with the invention should not possess catalytic<br>
isomerization; or conversion activity with respect to. the C8 aromatic feedstream.   For<br>
purposes of the subject invention, a molecular sieve which is not catalytically reactive vyill<br>
preferably exhibit less than 10% conversion of para-xylene to meta-xylene or ortho-<br>
i xylene, more preferably less than 5% conversion, and most preferably less than 1%<br>
conversion, at the temperature of operation for the para-xylene separation processes<br>
which utilize the adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention.	j<br>
The ratio y/x in the unit cell formula (I) provides an indication of various molecular sieve properties, including acidity and hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.   As the ratio y/x<br>
10<br><br>
increases, the acidity and hydrophilicity of the sieve material decreases. The ratio y/x of molecular sieve materials for use in the invention generally is greater than one. Preferably, the ratio y/x is at least about 200, more preferably at least about 500, and most preferably at least about 1000.<br>
Molecular sieves suitable for use as adsorbents in accordance with the invention include zeolitic materials containing pore dimensions in the range of 5 A to 6 A, preferably 5.1 A to 5.7 A, and more preferably 5.3 A to 5.6 A. These materials typically contain 10-ring tetrahedra structures, and are generally referred to as "medium pore zeolites." Suitable medium pore molecular sieves include, but are not limited to, sieves having a-structure type selected from the group consisting of Mobil-twenty three (MTT), ferrierite (FER), Edinburgh. University-one (EUO), Mobil-fifty seven (MFS), theta-one<br>
(TON), aluminophosphate-eleven (AEL), new-eighty seven (NES) and others with similar<br>
i<br>
pore sizes, as classified in Meier and Olson, "Atlas of Zeolite Framework Types," International Zeolite Association (2001), Preferably, the molecular sieve material is selected from Mobil-Five (MFI) and  Mobil-eleven  (MEL) structural types.     More<br>
preferably, the molecular,sieve materials of the MFI structural type.<br>
i<br>
Preferred molecular sieves for use in the adsorbent compositions include ZSM-5 (MFI structure type), Z$M-11 (MEL structure type), and related isotypic structures. Furthermore, the molecular sieve material can comprise silicalite. More preferably, the molecular sieve material ican comprise silicalite-1. Silicalites (molecular sieves having the MFI structure type) are essentially all silica molecular sieves, containing minimal amounts of aluminum or other elements.<br>
Small-pore molecular sieves,, such as type A zeolite, which contain 8-ring structures do not have, a sufficiently large pore opening to effectively adsorb, para-xylene within the sieve. Most large pore molecular sieves containing 12-ring structures, such! as mordenite, Beta, LTL, or Y zeolite, do not selectively adsorb para-xylene with respect to ortho-xylene and meta-xylene without post synthetic modification such as selectivation,<br>
ion-exchange, etc. However, several 12-ring structures, having a smaller effective pore size, for example, because of ring puckering, are useful in the adsorbent compositions according to the invention.. Such useful large pore molecular sieves include Mobil-twelye (MTW), and aluminophosphate-thirty one (ATO) structure types. ZSM-12 Is an example of a suitable sieve material having the MTW framework and AIPO-31 is an example of a suitable sieve material having the ATO framework.    Additionally,  post-synthetic<br>
II<br><br>
treatments of 12-ring molecular sieves can be used to achieve para-xylene selectivity increases beyond those observed in the as-synthesized materials. For example, Y or X zeolites ion exchanged to the potassium or barium form have exhibited xylene selectivities for liquid-phase SiMBAC processes. Such modified molecular sieves of the faujasite (FAU) framework would also be suitable for use in the invention.<br>
MFI. and MEL sieves (and sieves having the framework structures listed above) can be used to the extent they are substantially non-catalytically active. MFI-based molecular sieves are especially preferred. Silicalite, more specifically, silicalite-1, is most preferred. Silicalites (a molecular sieve having the MFI structure type) are essentially all silica molecular sieves, containing minimal amounts of aluminum or other substituted elements. Preferably, the silicon/aluminum ratio of suitable silicalites is at least about 200, and more preferably at least about 500. The silicon/aluminum ratio of adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention can suitably be greater than about 1000.<br>
Binder	I<br>
The adsorbent compositions can contain 100% molecular sieve. Generally, however, the adsorbent compositions also include a binder material. Binder materials are generally employed to impart certain desirable properties to formed adsorbent compositions (e.g., improved crush strength). Suitable binders are selected from the group consisting of clays, silicas, silicates, zirconias, titanias, aluminas, silica-aluminas, silica-magnesias, silica-zirconias, silica-thorias, silica-beryllias, silica-titanias, silica-aiumina-thorias, silica-alumina-zirconias, silica-alumina-magnesias, silica-magnesla-zirconias, aluminum phosphates, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the binder is selected from the group consisting of clays, silicas, silicates, zirconias, titanias, and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The adsorbent compositions may also comprise zeolite bound zeolites. In tlhis embodiment of the subject adsorbent compositions, zeofite core crystals are bound by smaller zeolite binder crystals. One procedure for making zeolite-bound zeolite involves converting the silica initially present as silica binder in a silica-bound zeolite aggregate to a zeolite binder (i.e., the silica binder is a zeolitic precursor). The procedure involves aging the silica bound aggregate for sufficient time in an aqueous alkaline solution. During the aging, the amorphous silica surrounding the matrix zeolite crystals is typically converted into zeofite crystals of the same type as the matrix zeolite. Alternatively the silica binder may be converted to crystals which are a crystallographic match for the<br>
12<br><br>
initially bound zeolite, provided both materials are selective for para-xylene. The newly-formed zeolite crystal surrounding the initial matrix crystals are generally much smaller than the matrix crystals, e.g., of sub-micron size. For the purposes of the subject invention, the term binder includes such zeolite binders.<br>
Typically, the binder comprises up to about 50 wt.% of the composition, based on the total weight of the adsorbent composition. Preferably, the binder comprises about 5 wt.% to about 40 wt.%, more preferably about 10 wt.% to about 30 wt.% of the composition, and most preferably about 20 wt.% of the adsorbent composition.<br>
The binder content of the adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention can also be expressed as a weight ratio of molecular sieve material to binder. Preferably, the weight ratio of molecular sieve material to binder is at least about one, more preferably at least about three, and most preferably at least about four.<br>
The adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention are preferably<br>
substantially free of gamma-alumina. In the context of this invention, "substantially free<br>
of gamma-alumina" means that the adsorbent compositions contain Jess than about 2.<br>
wt.% of materials consisting of gamma-alumina, based on the total weight of the<br>
. composition. More preferably .'the adsorbent compositions contain less than about 1<br>
wt.%, and most preferably less than about 0.20 wt.% of materials consisting of gamma-<br>
alumina. Gamma-alumina content can be measured by ASTM Test Method D4926|-89<br>
(2001).		<br>
Furthermore, the adsorbent compositions preferably contain less than about 2 wt.%, more preferably less than about 1 wt.%, and most preferably less than about 0.20 wt.% of materials consisting of alumina. In yet a further refinement, the adsorbent compositions preferably have less than about 2 wt.%, more preferably less than about 1 wt.%, and most preferably less than about 0.20 wt.% of materials consisting of A12o(3-x)(OH)2x wherein x ranges from 0 to about 0.8. Such materials generally include aluminas and activated aluminas, i.e., thermal decomposition products of aluminum trihydroxides, oxide hydroxides, and nonstoichiometric gelatinous hydroxides. Clays comprising aluminas and/or activated aluminas are not excluded by the foregoing disclosure.<br>

Methods of Making Adsorbent Compositions<br>
i<br>
The invention provides methods for making para-xylene selective adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention. According to one embodiment, para-xylene selective adsorbents are prepared by forming a powder from a composition comprising a molecular sieve material, forming an aqueous mixture from the powder, extruding the mixture to form an extrudate, and drying the extrudate to form an adsorbent in accordance with the invention.<br>
Adsorbent Composition Properties<br>
The para-xylene: selectivity and the throughput of the adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention were unexpectedly improved by increasing the pore volume to large transport-type macropores (pores having a radius in excess of about 00 A), while decreasing the pore volume due to smaller mesopores (pores having a adius less than about 600A). Similarly, the selectivity and the throughput of adsorbent repositions in accordance with the invention were unexpectedly improved when the itio of   macropore   volume   to   mesopore   volume   is   increased.      Porosimetry<br>
easurements were made on the adsorbent compositions using a Quantachrome<br>
j<br>
remaster 60 porosimeter as described in Example 12.<br>
The macropore and mesopore volumes of an adsorbent composition can i be<br>
t<br>
altered by standard means which are known, to those of ordinary skill in the. art.<br><br>
Macropore and mesopore volume can be affected by, for example, changing the binder<br>
and/or adding a pore former to the adsorbent composition prior to extrusion. The use of<br>
more porous binders, such as for example binders consisting of gamma-alumina,<br>
typically increases the macropore volume of the disclosed adsorbents.   Adsorbent<br>
macropore volume can also be increased by adding pore, formers such as Na2C03 to the<br>
adsorbent composition prior to extrusion.<br>
i<br>
Preferably, the macropore volume of the adsorbent composition is greater than<br>
about 0.20 cc/g, more preferably greater than about 0,30 cc/g, and most preferably<br>
greater than about 0.35'cc/g.    Preferably, the mesopore volume of the adsorbent<br>
compositions is less than about 0.20 cc/g, more preferably less than about 0.15 cc/g,<br>
and most preferably less than about 0.10 cc/g. Adsorbents having a macropore. volume<br>
i of greater than about 0.35 cc/g and a mesopore volume of less than about 0.10 cc/g are<br>
14<br><br>
particularly preferred (e.g., see the adsorbent composition of Example 7 which has a macropore volume of about 0.40 cc/g and a mesopore volume of about 0.05 cc/g.)<br>
Increasing the ratio of macropore volume to mesopore volume provides increased selectivity and throughput to the adsorbent compositions in accordance with the invention. Preferably, the adsorbent compositions have a volumetric ratio of macropores to mesopores of at least about two, more preferably at least about five, and most preferably at least about 10.<br>
Increased throughput (as measured by grams feed per grams formed adsorbent<br>
per hour) is an additional benefit realized from increasing the macropore pore volume in<br>
the adsorbent-compositions in accordance with the invention. The throughput of a<br>
formed adsorbent composition determines the amount of adsorbent needed to process a<br>
given amount of a C6 hydrocarbon mixture. Accordingly, increasing the throughput<br>
results in smaller adsorbent composition loadings and reduced capital cost.	<br>
Para-xylene Separation Processes	<br>
The invention provides methods for effecting separations of para-xylene (or paraxylne  and ethylbenzene) from mixed xylenes (or a C8 aromatic mixture, respectively), which utilize the para-xylene. selective adsorbents in accordance with the invention. The adsorbent compositions can be used to effect separations in gas-phase adsorption processes, e.g., in any vapor phase swing adsorption process. Accordingly, pressure swing adsorption unite, partial pressure swing adsorption units, and thermal swing adsorption units can be used to practice the inventive methods.<br>
According to one embodiment, the method comprises contacting a feed mixture comprising xylene isomers with a para-xylene selective adsorbent in accordance with the invention and desorbing from the para-xylene selective adsorbent an effluent comprising<br>
a para-xylene enriched product.<br>
i<br>
Preferably, the contacting step is carried out at an operating temperature between about 145 °C and about 400 °C and/or at an operating pressure between about 345 kPa and about 6895 kPa. More preferably, the contacting step is carried out ;at an operating temperature between about 200 °C and about 300 °C and/or at an operating pressure between about 448 kPa and about 2068 kPa. It is particularly preferred that the operating temperature is isothermal and/or the operating pressure is isobaric.<br>
15<br><br>
Generally, the'. desorbing step comprises feeding a sweep gas into a bed.<br>
Typically, the desorbing step is carried out at an operating temperature between about<br>
i<br>
145 °C and about 400 °C, and/or an operating pressure between about 345 kPa and about 6895 kPa. More preferably, the desorbing step is carried out at an. operating temperature between about 200 °C and about 300 °C and an operating pressure between about 448 kPa and about 2068 kPa.<br>
The method may further include contacting the mixture with the adsorbent to<br>
obtain a para=xylene-depleted raffinate and isomerizing at least a portion of the para-<br>
xylene depleted raffinate to obtain a hydrocarbon mixture comprising equilibrated xylene<br>
isomers.' The hydrocarbon mixture comprising equilibrated xylene isomers and<br>
generated by an isomerization step is preferably combined with at least a portion of the<br>
feed mixture comprising xylene isomers.	I<br>
i<br>
Adsorbent compositions in accordance with the. invention also can be used; in a non-decreasing total pressure/swinging partial pressure method of adsorbing para-xylene from a feed of CB aromatics comprising xylene isomers, wherein an adsorbed para-xylene enriched product is desorbed and collected, and an unadsorbed. (para-xylene depleted) portion of the feed is isomerized to produce an equilibrated mixture of xylene isomers, which can be combined with the feed. A more detailed description of the method is set forth in U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0107427 (July 10, 2001). One embodiment of that method generally, includes contacting at a substantially non-decreasing total pressure a gaseous mixture comprising xylene, isomers and ethylbenzene with a para-xylene selective adsorbent to obtain a para-xylene depleted raffinate and a desorption effluent comprising a para-xylene enriched product The method also includes isomerizing at least a portion of the para-xylene depleted raffinate. The isomerization step includes isomerizing the para-xylene depleted raffinate to obtain a hydrocarbon mixture comprising equilibrated xylene isomers. To increase the yield of para-xylene, a portion of the equilibrated xylene isomers obtained by way of isomerization can be combined with the mixture before contacting the adsorbent (i.e., recycled).<br>

The adsorbent compositions of Examples 3-11 were tested in the two bed i 'adsorption apparatus depicted in Figure 1, at 195°C and 35 psia (241,3 kPa), to<br>
determine the recovery of para-xylene and ethylbenzene, the selectivity, and the<br>
throughput. Results from the experiments are given in Table 3, below.<br>
The composition of the feed stream (a) used in the experiments was 5.37lwt.%<br>

ethylbenzene, 22.29 wt.% para-xylene, 49.06 wt.% meta-xylene, and 23.28 wt.% orho-xylene. The flow rate of the. feed stream (a) was adjusted as needed so that' 85% recovery was obtained; thereby allowing the adsorbent compositions to be compared on an equal basis. The sweep flow (e) was-15.0 cubic feet of nitrogen per hour at standard conditions (SCFH of nitrogen).<br>
As indicated in Figure 1, the desorption effluent (c) was collected as a separate product in these experiments. In a commercial unit, stream (c) would normally be recycled to the feed stream (a).<br>

Turning now to the figures, Figure 2 is a plot of throughput versus macropore volume for the adsorbent compositions of Examples 3-11. Figure 2 shows that the throughput of the adsorbent compositions is generally increased as the macropore<br>
volume of the adsorbent; compositions is increased.<br>
i<br>
Figure 3 is a plot of (pX+EB) selectivity versus macropore volume for the adsorbent compositions of Examples 3-6 in view of a plot showing (pX+EB) selectivity<br>
21<br><br>
versus macropore volume for the adsorbent compositions of Examples 7-11, which contain varying quantities of gamma-alumina. Figure 3 illustrates that the gamma-alumina-containing adsorbent compositions are less selective for para-xylene than the adsorbent compositions of Examples 3-6, for similar macropore volume values, tlhereby indicating that the adsorbent compositions should preferably be substantially free of gamma-alumina.<br>
Figure 4 shows a plot of (pX+EB) purity versus P for the adsorbent compositions of Examples 3-6 in view of a plot showing (pX+EB) purity versus P for the adsorbent compositions of Examples 7-11. Figure 4 illustrates that the-gamma-alumina-containing adsorbent compositions of Examples 7-11 are less selective for para-xylene than, the adsorbent compositions of Examples 3-6, for similar P values, thereby illustrating that the alumina-containing adsorbents do not perform separations as well as the adsorbents in accordance with the invention, which do not contain alumina.<br>
Additionally, Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate that Example 11, which has a volumetric ratio of micropores to mesopores of less than two, performs relatively unsatisfactorily in separating C8 aromatics. The relatively unsatisfactory performance of this adsorbent is manifested in the combination of relatively low throughput and selectivity values (when compared with the throughput and selectivity values for the adsorbents of the other examples).<br>

Such compositions can be used in gas-phase adsorption processes for the separation of para-xylene or the separation of para-xylene and ethylbenzene from mixed xylenes or a C8 aromatic mixture, respectively. The adsorbent compositions generally comprise materials of a molecular sieve material and a binder, wherein the adsorbent composition has a macropore volume of at least about 0.20 cc/g and a mesopore volume of less than about 0.20 cc/g.<br></td>
