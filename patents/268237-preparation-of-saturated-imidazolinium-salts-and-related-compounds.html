Cross Reference to Related Applications<br>
This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119 to U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 61/002,754 filed November 9, 2007.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
During the last decade, the use of N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) as ligands in organometallic complexes has become routine. NHCs, as neutral, two-electron donors with little backbonding character, have replaced phosphines in a variety of applications. See Diez-Gonzalez, S.; Nolan, S. P. Coord. Chem. Rev. 2007, 251, 874/ Herrmann, W. A., Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 1290. Particularly, their use as ligands in ruthenium-based olefin metathesis has allowed for great gains in both activity and stability. Scholl, M.; Ding, S.; Lee, C. W.; Grubbs, R. H. Org. Lett. 1999, 1, 953. There is also increasing interest in NHCs as nucleophilic reagents and organocatalysts, with wide use in condensation reactions such as the benzoin condensation, among others. Marion, N.; Diez-Gonzalez, S.; Nolan, S. P. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2007, 46, 2988.<br>
Because saturated free carbenes are sensitive toward oxygen and moisture, they are, in most applications, prepared in situ via the deprotonation of their corresponding imidazol(in)ium salts (Equation 1, where the R groups refer to afkyl and aryl groups known in the art for NHC ligands). Therefore, facile and high yielding methods for the synthesis of imidazol(in)ium salts are of great interest.<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
Equation 1<br>
The synthesis of unsaturated imldazolium salts has been optimized and they are now easily prepared by a one step procedure starting from glyoxal, substituted aniline, formaldehyde and an acid.  Arduengo, A. J., Ill, Preparation of 1,3-Disubstitutedlmidazolium Salts, 1991, U.S. Patent No. 5,077,414. Unfortunately, the preparation of saturated imidazolinium salts still requires several synthetic transformations, including either a palladium-catalyzed C-N coupling or a reduction (Equation 2, where the R groups refer to the hydrocarbyl, or substituted hydrocarbyl groups in U.S. Patent No. 5,077,414).<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
Equation 2<br>
A new pathway to prepare unsaturated imidazolinium salts was developed starting from the addition of a compound featuring two leaving groups to lithiated formamidines. Jazzar, R; Liang, H; Donnadieu, B; Bertrand, G. Journal of Organometallic Chemistry 2006, 691 3201. However, the cyclization<br>
reaction of the formanidine to the final imidazolinium requires an additional reflux in THF (Equation 3).<br>
(Equation Removed) <br>
Equation 3<br>
There remains a need in the art to provide improved methods for the preparation of saturated imidazolinium salts and similar compounds from commercially available substituted anilines, naphthylamines, or anthracenylamines. This invention answers that need.<br>

The methods of the invention make it possible to obtain a variety of compounds of formula (III), including imidazolinium chlorides, under solvent-free reaction conditions and in excellent yields. As described below, numerous symmetric and unsymmetric compounds of formula (III) with a variety of N-aryl substituents have been prepared and isolated.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of preparing a compound of formula (III).  In this method, a formamidine of formula (I) is reacted with a compound of formula (II) under conditions sufficient to form a compound of formula (III), according to reaction Scheme 1:<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 1<br>
In Scheme 1, each Ar is aryl group, each Ar being independently selected from the group consisting of phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl. The Ar group in each occurrence may be the same or different.  In certain embodiments, the Ar groups are phenyl.<br>
R1 defines subsituents on Ar and may be the same or different in each occurrence even as to substituents on the same aryl groups.  R1 in each<br>
occurrence is independently selected from the group consisting of C1-C6 alkyl; C1-C6 alkoxy; halogen; aryl;  -Si(R2)3, wherein each R2 is independently a C1-C6 alkyl; and -NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are independently a C1-C6 alkyl or wherein R3 and R4, together with the nitrogen carrying them form a 5- or 6-membered heterocyclic ring. The alkyl, alkylene, or alkoxy chains for R1, as well as for any alkyl, alkylene, or alkoxy groups may be straight chain or branched. The aryl group in R1 may be substituted or unsubsituted.  Common substituents may be selected from those known in the art, including but not limited to C1-C6 alkyl; C1-C6 alkoxy; halogen; nitro; sulfate; -Si(R2)3, wherein each R2 is independently a C1-C6 alkyl; and -NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are independently hydrogen or C1-C6 alkyl.<br>
In certain aspects of the invention, R1 in each occurrence may be independently selected from the group consisting of C1-C4 alkyl; C1-C4 alkoxy; fluorine; chlorine; phenyl; naphtyl; -Si(R2)3, wherein each R2 is independently a C1-C4 alkyl; and -NR3R4, wherein R3 and R4 are Independently a C1-C4 alkyl. In another embodiment, Rl may be methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl, tert-butyl or fluorine. R2, R3 and R4 may be methyl, ethyl, iso-propyl, or tert-butyl.<br>
The variable "n" defines the number of R1 substituents on the Ar groups. The value of n varies with the type of aryl group.  For example, n ranges from 0 to 5 when Ar is phenyl, from 0 to 7 when Ar is naphthyl, and from 0-9 when Ar is anthracenyl. When n is 0, the aryl group is unsubstitued. The degree of substitution on an aryl ring typically ranges from 1 to 3.  When Ar is a phenyl group, n is 1 with ortho, meta, or para substitution on the phenyl ring; n is 2 with di-ortho, di-meta, ortho and meta, or ortho and para substitution on the phenyl ring; or n is 3 with di-ortho and para, or di-meta and para substitution on the phenyl ring.<br>
Compounds of formula (II) have the formula X-(CH2)P-X. The variable "p" defines the number of methylene groups and ranges from 2 to 5. In certain embodiments, p is 2 or 3, such that the compounds of formula (III) have a 5- or 6-membered ring. Compounds of formula (III) having a 5-membered ring are called saturated imidazolinium compounds. Such compounds have a saturated methylene chain linking the two ring nitrogens and may be prepared from compounds of formula (II) having a methylene.<br>
For compounds of formula (II), X is a leaving group. In the reaction X is displaced in the formation of the compound of formula (III). Leaving groups known in the art may be used for X. Exemplary leaving groups include, but are not limited to, a halogen, mesylate, tosylate perchlorate, sulfate, or triflate. Chlorine and bromine are exemplary halogens. Although not required, an excess of the compounds of formula (II) may be used relative to the formamidine of formula (I).<br>
In the reaction described in Scheme 1, the formamidine of formula (I) may act as both a reactant and a sacrificial base.  When used as a reactant, the formamidine is generally present in less than one fifth of the molar amount of the compound of formula (II), with a molar ratio of formamidine to formula (II) typically ranging from 1:20 to 1:5. When used as a sacrificial base, the formamidine is generally present in less than one fifth of the molar amount of compound of formula (II), with a molar ratio of formamidine to formula (II) typically ranging from 1:10 to 1:5. Alternatively, the reaction can also occur in the presence of a non-nucleophilic base. The non-nucleophilic base is generally present in a slight molar excess compared to the formamidine, typically with a molar ratio of about 1:1 to 2:1.  Non-nucleophilic abases known in the art may be used in the reaction of Scheme 1.  Exemplary non-nucleophilic bases include, but are not limited to, di-isopropylethylamine (DIPA), 2,6-dimethylpiperidine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine, di-isopropylamine, Li salt of di-isopropylamide, and bis(trimethylsilyl)amine.<br>
The reaction of Scheme 1 may be conducted in the presence or absence of a solvent. Exemplary solvents include nonpolar, aprotic solvents such as diethoxyethane or an aromatic solvent, e.g., toluene, xylene or mesitylene. For a solvent-free synthesis, the compound of formula (II), X-(CHj)p-X, e.g, dichloroethane (DCE), may act as the solvent.  Solvent-free conditions generally provide certain advantages, including reduced expense.<br>
Although not limited thereto, the reaction of Scheme 1 is generally run at a temperature ranging from about 40ยฐC to about 150ยฐC and for a time period ranging from about 16 hours to about 168 hours. When compounds of formula (II) are dichloroethane (DCE), a reaction temperature of over 100ยฐC is typically used. The use of dibromoethane (DBE) formula(II) compounds typically requires a lower reaction temperature than DCE; diiodoethane (DIE) requires<br>
even lower reaction temperature than DBE. Increased steric bulk of substituents on the aryl groups of formamidine of formula (I) may result In longer reaction times, while higher temperature or longer reaction time may increase the yield of compounds of formula (III).<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the reaction of Scheme 1 may be carried out under a dry, inert atmosphere.  Inert atmospheres, as is known in the art, typically employ inert gases, including such gases as nitrogen and argon.  The reactions of the invention may also be carried out in an oxygen-containing and/or water containing atmosphere.<br>
In another aspect in accordance with the reaction of Scheme 1, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of symmetric and unsymmetric saturated imidazolinium chlorides that comprises reaction of a formamidine with dichloroethane (DCE) and a base. Diisopropyfethylamine (DIPA) has been found to be an effective base (Table 1, Method A). As discussed above, the formamidine can act as both substrate and sacrificial base in the reaction (Table 1, Method B). Both the imidazolinium chlorides and hydrochloride salt of either base can be isolated by means known in the art, e.g., by sequential precipitation in a solvent such as toluene or acetone. General procedures to isolate and purify imidazolinium salts are described in the examples below. The formamidine salts produced in the reaction may also be regenerated to form formamidine. For example, formamidine hydrochloride can be reverted to formamidine by solvation in pyridine followed by precipitation in water.<br>

a Yield in brackets based on a 50% theoretical yield with half of the substrate considered as a sacrificial base. b While neither reaction had reached 100% conversion, the reactions were stopped after 7 days.<br>
The methods of the invention may also include the step of preparing the formamidine of formula (I) by the reaction of Scheme 2:<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 2<br>
This procedure for preparing formamidines of formula (I) has been described in Roberts, R. M., J. Org. Chem. 1949,14(2), 277 and Kuhn, K. M.; Grubbs, R. H. Org. Lett  2008, 10, 2075.<br>
As noted, each Ar in Scheme 2 may be the same or different. When compounds of formula (IV) having different Ar groups are used in a reaction of Scheme 2the compounds of formula (IV) are reacted sequentially with the<br>
trialkyl orthoformate of formula (V), resulting In a formamadine of formula (I) having different Ar groups.<br>
In Scheme 2, each Ar is independently selected from the group consisting of phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl, As in Scheme 1, Ar may be phenyl but, because two moles of the compound of formula (IV) are used, each Ar may be different.  When more than one compound of formula (IV) is used, each Ar is different and the compounds of formula (IV) are reacted sequentially with the trialkyl orthoformate of formula (V) prior to reaction with compound (II).<br>
The subsituents and variables R1, n, X, and p are the same as described above with reference to Scheme 1.<br>
For the trialkyl orthoformate of formula (V) R5 is a C1-C6 alkyl, and may be a C1-C4 alkyl such as, but not limited to, methyl, ethyl, propyl, iso-propyl or tert-butyl.  For example, a triethyl orthoformate, where R5 is ethyl, may be used.<br>
The reaction conditions such as solvent, reaction temperature, reaction time period, reaction atmosphere are the same as described above with reference to Scheme 1.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention relates to a one-step method of preparing a compound of formula (III) according to reaction Scheme 3.  In this method, a compound of formula (IV) is reacted with a trialkyl orthoformate of formula (V) in the presence of a compound of formula (II) under conditions sufficient to form a compound of formula (III). The groups Ar are the same in each occurrence.<br>
(Scheme Removed) <br>
Scheme 3<br>
While not limited thereto, one mole of the compounds of formula (V) is generally used in Scheme 3 to react with two moles of the compounds of formula (IV) in the presence of excess amount of the compounds of formula (II). The molar ratio of the compounds of formula (IV) to formula (V) and to formula (II) is typically 2:5:1. The reaction conditions are generally the same as described above for Schemes 1 and 2.<br>
The preparation of symmetric imidazolinium chlorides in a one-step method of the invention is described in Table 2. The formamidine, as base and intermediate, is formed in situ, followed by cyclization to yield the imidazolinium salt,<br>

The following examples illustrate the various embodiments of the invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages and modifications within the scope of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention pertains.<br>
Method A describes the preparation of compounds of formula (III) according to Scheme 1 with a non-nucleophilic base.  Method B describes the preparation of compounds of formula (III) according to Scheme 1 using the formamidine of formula (I) as a sacrificial base.  Method C describes the one-step method of oreparation of compounds of formula (III) via Scheme 3.<br>
Method Al: Diisopropylethylamine (1.1 equiv) was added to a stirred solution of formamidine (1 equiv) and dichloroethane (10 equiv) in a schlenk tube. The tube was evacuated until solvent began to bubble and then sealed and heated to 120 ยฐC for 24-168 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled to room temperature, diluted with solvent (acetone or hot toluene), and the precipitated imidazoiinium chloride was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with excess solvent and dried in vacuo. Upon sitting overnight, the Diisopropylethylamine hydrochloride precipitated from the filtrate.<br>
Example 1: According to method Al, diisopropylethylamine (0.34 mL, 1.96 mmol) was added to a stirred solution of N,N'-dimesitylformamidine (0.5 g, 1.78 mmol) and dichloroethane (1.36 mL, 17.8 mmol) in a schlenk tube. The tube was evacuated until solvent began to bubble and then sealed and heated to 120 ยฐC for 24 hours. The reaction mixture was then cooled, added to toluene (40 mL) and then brought to reflux. While still hot, the precipitate was collected by vacuum filtration, washed with toluene (5 mL) and dried in vacuo to afford 1,3-dimesitylimidazolinium chloride (0.56 g, 92%) as a light peach powder.<br>
Example 2: N,N'-dimesitylformamidine (DMFA; 1 equivalent), 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), and a magnetic stir bar were charged to a 3-neck round-bottomed flask which was fitted with a refluxing condenser and a thermowell. The flask was heated in an oil bath to the desired temperature and diisopropylethylamine (DIPA) was then added. The flask was kept at the temperature for a period of time.  DCE was stripped off by distillation. Toluene was added to the mixture, and the flask was allowed to cool. Acetone was added and the solid was collected by filtration. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 16 h and at 40ยฐC for 8 h.  Experimental conditions and results are summarized in Table 3.<br>

Example 3: N,N'-Dimesitylformamidine (DMFA; 1 equivalent), 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE; 5 equivalents), and a magnetic stir bar were charged to a 3-neck round-bottomed flask which was fitted with a reflux condenser and thermowell. The flask was heated in an oil bath to the desired temperature and diisopropylethylamine (DIPA; 1.1 equivalents) was then added. The flask was kept at temperature for a period of time. The excess DBE was stripped off under vacuum and the flask was allowed to cool to room temperature. Acetone was added with careful stirring to break up the resultant solid mass. The sturry was filtered and the recovered solid was washed with acetone. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 16 h and at 40ยฐC for 8 h. Experimental conditions and results are summarized in Table 4.<br>

Example 4:  N,N'-Dimesitylformamidine (2.8 g, 10 mmol), 1,3-dibromopropane (10.0 g, 50 mmol), and a magnetic stir bar were charged to a<br>
50-mL round-bottomed flask which was fitted with a reflux condenser and connected to a nitrogen bubbler. The flask was placed in an oil bath, and diisopropylethylamine (1.42 g, 11 mmol) was added when the oil temperature reached 110ยฐC, The temperature of the oil bath was then raised to 130ยฐC for 3.5 hours. The mixture was cooled and volatiles (primarily 1,3-dibromopropane) were removed under vacuum. The resulting solid was identified as the desired 1,3-dimesityltetrahydropyrimidinium bromide by lH NMR analysis.   lH NMR (CDCl3): ฮด 7.55 (s, NCHN, 1H), 6.92 (s, Me3C6H2, 4H), 4.19 (t, NCH2CH2CH2N, 4H), 2.57 (m, NCH2CH2CH2N, 2H), 2.32 (s, 0-CM3, 12H), 2.25 (s, p-CHb, 6H).<br>
Example 5. N,N'-Dimesitylformamidine (DMFA; 0.10 mole, 1 equivalent), 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE), solvent, and a magnetic stir bar were charged to a 3-neck round-bottomed flask which was fitted with a reflux condenser and thermowell. The flask was heated in an oil bath to 110ยฐC (in case of toluene, 100ยฐC) and diisopropylethylamine (DIPA; 0.11 mole, 1.1 equivalents) was then added. The flask was kept at 110ยฐC for 16 hours.  For entry a and b the excess DBE (entry a and b) was stripped off under vacuum. For entry c through e the stripping step was skipped. The flask was allowed to cool to room temperature. Acetone was added and the solid was filtered and washed with acetone. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 16 h and at 40ยฐC for 8 h.  Experimental conditions and results are summarized in Table 5.<br>

General procedure to isolate and purify l,3-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)imidazolinium chloride (sIMes-HCI ) and sIMes-HBr<br>
From the reaction mixture of sIMes-HCI and DIPA-HCI: Because large excess of DCE (10 - 20 eq) was used, it was necessary to remove DCE from the solution at 80-100 ยฐC. When the mixture became slurry, small amount of toluene was added and mixture was stirred at 100 ยฐC. The mixture was subject to vacuum again in order to completely remove DCE at 110 ยฐC. After removal of DCE, toluene was added and the slurry was stirred at 100 ยฐC.  Once cooled to 60 ยฐC, the slurry was filtered and the solid was washed with acetone. The solid was collected and dried in a vacuum oven. This procedure was applicable to either small or large scale (0.025 mol to 50 mol).<br>
From the reaction mixture of sIMes-HBr and DIPA-HBr: A. Large Scale (4.35 mol): After the completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled at 50-60 ยฐC. The slurry was filtered in a Nutch filter.  Hexane/Water (10/1 by volume) was added and the slurry was manually<br>
stirred. The liquid was filtered off and the solid was further washed with acetone. The solid was dried in a vacuum oven.<br>
B. Small Scale (0.1 mol to 1.0 mol): It was the same as the large scale isolation except the hexane/water wash was skipped.<br>
Discussion: Bas'cally the reaction mixture at the end of the reaction consists of two salts, namely sIMes-HX and DIPA-HX (X = CI or Br). The principle to separate the two salts is the solubility in different solvents at different temperature. The following table provides the basis for the separation.<br>
