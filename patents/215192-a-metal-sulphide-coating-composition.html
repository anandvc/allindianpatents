				<td>TECHNICAL FOLD<br>
The present invention relates to a. low friction coating and to the deposition of low friction coatings by vacuum ion and plasma techniques. oatings have non-stick properties, low hydrophilia and high stability.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The disulph:.des of elements such as Mo and. "W are known to have very low friction properties due to their unique chemical bonding and structure. MoS2 and WS2coa.tings are currently being deposited by vacuum ion and plasma techniques such as magnetron sputtering (MS), plasma assisted chemical vapour deposition (PACVD) and ion beam assisted, deposition (IBAD). MoS4 and WS2 coatings have been used in tribological applications as a solid lubrka.it in aerospace products [M.R. HILTON, P.D. FLEISCHAUER, Surface and Coating Technology, 68/69 (1994) 398; J.S. FRZYBYSZEWSKI, T. SPALVINS, Kasa TN D-5349, July 1969] and other engineering fields such as cuttbg applications [I RECHBER.GER, R- DUBACH, Surface and Coating Technology, 60(1993) 393],<br>
The-deposition process ha.5 always been subject of poor reproduc bility. Different techniques have been applied in order to enhance the reproduc .bility of coaling properties. among them the inclusion of other elements in the structure [M.R. HILTON, Surface and Coating technology, 68/69 (1994) 407;<br><br>
B.S. STUPP, thin Sclid Films, 84 (1981) 257]. In certain cases the induction of other elements enhanced the coating properties.<br>
General problems inherent to these family of coatings are their thernal and atmospheric instability. The coatings react with water vapour and oxygen transforming the sulphide into an oxide with very different tribological properties.  In addition to these problems the maximum useful thickness for the coating lias been always under 2 Âµm. Thicker coatings tend to suffer sever 2 cracking under working pressure conditions.<br>
Tungsten disulpbide films have had their tribological properties improved by incorporating CFX into a mixture of tungsten and sulphur by pul.se laser deposition [Surface and Coatings Technology Col 76-77, 1995 400-406].<br>
Similarly, fluorinated graphite containing 10-40% F has been added in mixtures to MoS2, 10 improve wear resistance; [SU 601306].<br>
However there remains a need for coatings with improved properties which overcome the limitations of present compositions.<br>

Referring to Figure 1, a deposition unit includes a vacuum charrber 1, which is vacuurred by means of a pumping system 2. The different elements referred within this invention can be introduced separately or by the same means or channels. In general a single or multiplicity of means 3 could incorporate the elements described in (a) on their own or accompanied by other elements. A sir.glc or multiplicity of means 4 could incorporate the suphur on its own or accompanied by other elements.

A single or multiplicity of means 7 could introduce one or more nobie gases on their own or accompanied by other gases or vapours phases. In the system described by this invention the samples due to<br><br>
be coated 8 are generally situated in a sample holder 9. One or several lines, areas and volumes of energization 10 are normally present within the system. The different elements interact in Those lines, areas or volumes producing the final coating on to the samples and other components surfaces. The energization 10 coule be plasmas generated by different means, particle accelerators temperature heaters, radiation waves or glow discharges processes. the sanples are normally biased by single or different excitation sources 11 in order tc control properties of the deposited films.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, in that in-line system samples 8 are troispc rted in their holder 9 in the direction from 12 to 13. Three chambers 15, 1 and 16 are represented. The chambers are vacuum isolated by gates 14. Each of the: chambers is vacuumed by individual pumping systems 2. In chamber 15 three coating units 20 produce a surface treatment prior to the main deposition. This surface treatment could include etching and/or deposition of one or several intenayers. Coaling units 20 normally are comprised of a main body 18 and a target material 19. One of the most common coating units 20 are the magnetrons, where 18 is the magnetron body and 19 the so called target. Inert gases are introduced through 7. which could also carry reactive gases. The chamber 1 is responsible for the deposition of a coating of the present invention. In the figure three magnetrons are represented. The mugnorons couprises magnetron body 21 and target material 22. The target material could be for example MoS:. Lines 4, 5 and 6 could inject gases such as SFM C2F4 and Si2F6. Line 7 could introduce inert gases such as AT. Chamber 16 represent a<br><br>
post-deposition treatment where a radiant source 23 irradiates the samples 8 producing a transformation in the deposited coating.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, the deposition chamber 1 is vacuumed by means of a purr-ping systen 2. Samples 8 are situated on to the sample holder 9. Sample lolder 9 is connected to a high frequency power supply 24. plasma discharge is generated between the sample holder 9 and an anode 25 which is earthed 26. The reactants are introduced into the chamber through 3. 4, 5, 6 and 7.<br>
Figure 4, .step view of a deposition chamber 1 which comprises three magnetrons 20. The samples are situated on a sample holder 9 which has two rotation axis 27 and 28 so that the samples could have an uniform coaling by rotating in front of all three magnetrons 20.<br>
Figure 5.. represents a chamber 1 which comprises one magneto n 20 and one electror cyclotron resonance (ECR) unit 29. Highly ionised species create a plasma 10 surrounding the samples 8 7he samples are situatec on to a holder 9 which rotates 2? allowing higher deposition homogeneity.<br>
Figure 6, represents a chamber 1 which comprises magnetron units 20 and an ion. implantatior (II) unit 30. A selected group of ions car. be accelerated by using a suitable magnetic arrangement 31, The growing of the film is mainly performed by the magnetrons 20. A plasma 10 surrounds the samples 8 which are supported by a rotating 27 holder 9. The II unit accelerates the ions up to such energy that they could penetrate into the growing film. This input of energy and new elements is used to control properties such as<br><br>
composition and structure within the Final deposited film.<br>
Figure 7, is a graph showing the relative concentration, in arbitrary units (a.t.), for different elements in a graded coating according to the present invention.<br>
.'Figure 8. represents a cross section of a multilayered coating according to the present invention. The substrate 32 has beer, coated first with one interlayer 33 which provides good adhesion between the multilayer aad the substrate. The multilayer is composed of alternative layers 34 and 35. Layers 34 could of any composition and structure. Layers 35 have any composition defined by MxSivRySzFw as disclosed in the present invention. A final layer 36 corresponds to a post-treatment which could provide a better aestheric appeal to the final coating, for example, a gold plating.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
