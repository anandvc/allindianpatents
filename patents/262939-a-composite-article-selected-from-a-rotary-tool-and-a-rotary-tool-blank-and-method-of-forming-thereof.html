COMPOSITE ARTICLE WITH COOLANT CHANNELS<br>
AND TOOL FABRICATION METHOD<br>
INVENTORS<br>
Prakash K. Mirchandani, Michale E. Walker,<br>
Jeffrey L. Weigold and Billy D. Swearengin<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to methods of forming articles,<br>
such as tool blanks, having a composite construction including regions of differing<br>
composition and/or microsructure. The present invention is additionally directed to<br>
rotary tools and tool blanks for rotary tools having a composite construction and at least<br>
one coolant channel. The method of the present invention finds general application in<br>
the production of rotary tools and may be applied in, for example, the production of<br>
cemented carbide rotary tools used in material removal operations such as drilling,<br>
reaming, countersinking, counterboring, and end milling.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION BACKGROUND<br>
Cemented carbide rotary tools (i.e., tools driven to rotate) are commonly<br>
employed in machining operations such as, for example, drilling, reaming,<br>
countersinking, counterboring, end milling, and tapping. Such tools are typically of a<br>
solid monolithic construction. The manufacturing process for such tools may involve<br>
consolidating metallurgical powder (comprised of particulate ceramic and binder metal)<br>
to form a compact. The compact is then sintered to form a cylindrical tool blank having<br>
a solid monolithic construction. As used herein, monolithic construction means that the<br>
tools are composed of a material, such as, for example, a cemented carbide material,<br>
having substantially the same characteristics at any working volume within the tool.<br>
Subsequent to sintering, the tool blank is appropriately machined to form the cutting edge<br>
and other features of the particular geometry of the rotary tool. Rotary tools include, for<br>
example, drills, end mills, reamers, and taps.<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
Rotary tools composed of cemented carbides are adapted to many<br>
industrial applications, including the cutting and shaping of materials of construction<br>
such as metals, wood, and plastics. Cemented carbide tools are industrially important<br>
because of the combination of tensile strength, wear resistance, and toughness that is<br>
characteristic of these materials. Cemented carbides materials comprise at least two<br>
phases: at least one hard ceramic component and a softer matrix of metallic binder. The<br>
hard ceramic component may be, for example, carbides of elements within groups IVB<br>
through VIB of the periodic table. A common example is tungsten carbide. The binder<br>
may be a metal or metal alloy, typically cobalt, nickel, iron or alloys of these metals. The<br>
binder "cements" the ceramic component within a matrix interconnected in three<br>
dimensions. Cemented carbides may be fabricated by consolidating a metallurgical<br>
powder blend of at least one powdered ceramic component and at least one powdered<br>
binder.<br>
The physical and chemical properties of cemented carbide materials<br>
depend in part on the individual components of the metallurgical powders used to<br>
produce the material. The properties of the cemented carbide materials are determined<br>
by, for example, the chemical composition of the ceramic component, the particle size of<br>
the ceramic component, the chemical composition of the binder, and the ratio of binder<br>
to ceramic component. By varying the components of the metallurgical powder, rotary<br>
tools such as drills and end mills can be produced with unique properties matched to<br>
specific applications.<br>
Monolithic rotary tools may additionally comprise coolant channels<br>
extending through its body and shank to permit the flow of a coolant, such as oil or<br>
water, to the cutting surfaces of the rotary tool. The coolant may enter the channel at the<br>
shank end and exit at the drill point. The coolant cools the rotary tool and work piece<br>
and assists in ejecting chips and dirt from the hole. The use of coolant during machining<br>
operations allows for the use of higher cutting speeds of the rotary tool and faster feed<br>
rates, in addition to extending tool life. Rotary tools with coolant channels are especially<br>
suited for drilling deep holes in hard materials.<br>
However, the monolithic construction of rotary tools inherently limits<br>
their performance and range of applications. As an example, Figure 1 depicts side and<br>
end views of a twist drill 10 having a typical design used for creating and finishing holes<br>
in construction materials such as wood, metals, and plastics. The twist drill 10 includes a<br>
-2-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
chisel edge 11, which makes the initial cut into the workpiece. The cutting tip 14 of the<br>
drill 10 follows the chisel edge 11 and removes most of the material as the hole is being<br>
drilled. The outer periphery 16 of the cutting tip 14 finishes the hole. During the cutting<br>
process, cutting speeds vary significantly from the center of the drill to the drill's outer<br>
periphery. This phenomenon is shown in Figure 2, which graphically compares cutting<br>
speeds at an inner (D1), outer (D3), and intermediate (D2) diameter on the cutting tip of a<br>
typical twist drill. In Figure 2(b), the outer diameter (D3) is 1.00 inch and diameters D1<br>
and D2 are 0.25 and 0.50 inch, respectively. Figure 2(a) shows the cutting speeds at the<br>
three different diameters when the twist drill operates at 200 revolutions per minute. As<br>
illustrated in Figures 2(a) and (b), the cutting speeds measured at various points on the<br>
cutting edges of rotary tools will increase with the distance from the axis of rotation of<br>
the tools.<br>
Because of these variations in cutting speed, drills and other rotary tools<br>
having a monolithic construction will not experience uniform wear and/or chipping and<br>
cracking of the tool's cutting edges at different points ranging from the center to the<br>
outside edge of the tool's cutting surface. Also, in drilling casehardened materials, the<br>
chisel edge is typically used to penetrate the case, while the remainder of the drill body<br>
removes material from the casehardened material's softer core. Therefore, the chisel<br>
edge of conventional drills of monolithic construction used in that application will wear<br>
at a much faster rate than the remainder of the cutting edge, resulting in a relatively short<br>
service life for such drills. In both instances, because of the monolithic construction of<br>
conventional cemented carbide drills, frequent regrinding of the cutting edge is<br>
necessary, thus placing a significant limitation on the service life of the bit. Frequent<br>
regrinding and tool changes also result in excessive downtime for the machine tool that is<br>
being used.<br>
Therefore, composite articles, such as composite rotary tools have been<br>
used, such as those tools described in described in United States Patent No. 6,511,265<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. If designed properly, composite<br>
rotary tools may have increased tool service life as compared to rotary tools having a<br>
more monolithic construction. However, there exists a need for drills and other rotary<br>
tools that have different characteristics at different regions of the tool and comprise<br>
coolant channels. As an example, a need exists for cemented carbide drills and other<br>
rotary tools that will experience substantially even wear regardless of the position on the<br>
-3-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
tool face relative to the axis of rotation of the tool and allow cooling at the cutting<br>
surfaces. There is a need for a composite rotary tool having coolant channels so<br>
composite rotary tools may have the same benefits as monolithic rotary tools. There is<br>
also a need for a versatile method of producing composite rotary tools and composite<br>
rotary tools comprising coolant channels.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Embodiments of the present invention include composite articles<br>
comprising at least a first region and a second region. The first region may comprise a<br>

wherein the second composite material differs from the first composite material in at<br>
least one characteristic. The composite article may additionally comprise at least one<br>
coolant channel. In certain embodiments, the first and second composite material may<br>

DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides rotary cutting tools, cutting tool blanks,<br>
rods, and other articles having a composite construction and a method of making such<br>
articles. The articles may further comprise internal channels, such as coolant channels, if<br>
desired. As used herein, a rotary tool is a tool having at least one cutting edge that is<br>
driven to rotate. As used herein, "composite" construction refers to an article having<br>
regions differing in chemical composition and/or microstructure. These differences<br>
result in the regions having properties differing with respect to at least one characteristic.<br>
The characteristic may be at least one of, for example, hardness, tensile strength, wear<br>
resistance, fracture toughness, modulus of elasticity, corrosion resistance, coefficient of<br>
thermal expansion, and coefficient of thermal conductivity. Composite rotary tools that<br>
may be constructed as provided in the present invention include drills and end mills, as<br>
well as other tools that may be used in, for example, drilling, reaming, countersinking,<br>
counterboring, end milling, and tapping of materials.<br>
The present invention more specifically provides a composite rotary tool<br>
having at least one cutting edge, at least two regions of cemented carbide material that<br>
differ with respect to at least one characteristic, and at least one coolant channel. The<br>
differing characteristics may be provided by variation of at least one of the chemical<br>
composition and the microstructure among the two regions of cemented carbide material.<br>
The chemical composition of a region is a function of, for example, the chemical<br>
composition of the ceramic component and/or binder of the region and the carbide-to-<br>
binder ratio of the region. For example, one of the two cemented carbide material<br>
regions of the rotary tool may exhibit greater wear resistance, enhanced hardness, and/or<br>
a greater modulus of elasticity than the other of the two regions.<br>
Aspects of present invention may be described in relation to the tool blank<br>
400, shown in Figure 4(a) in a cross-sectional view transverse to the axis. The tool blank<br>
400 is a generally cylindrical sintered compact with two coaxially disposed cemented<br>
carbide regions 410, 420 and coolant channels 430. It will be apparent to one skilled in<br>
the art, however, that the following discussion of the present invention also may be<br>
adapted to the fabrication of composite rotary tools and tool blanks having more complex<br>
-7-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
geometry and/or more than two regions. Thus, the following discussion is not intended<br>
to restrict the invention, but merely to illustrate embodiments of it.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4(a), the cylindrical rotary tool blank 400 is<br>
comprised of two differing cemented carbide regions, a core region 400 and an outer<br>
region 410. The core region 420 and the outer region 410 are both of a cemented carbide<br>
material including ceramic particles in a continuous matrix of binder. Preferably, the<br>
cemented carbide materials in the core region 420 and in the outer region 410 include a<br>
ceramic component composed of carbides of one or more elements belonging to groups<br>
IVB through VIB of the periodic table including less than 5% cubic carbides or, in some<br>
applications, less than 3 wt. % cubic carbides. Embodiments of the present invention<br>
may comprise less than 5 wt. % cubic carbides because cubic carbides may reduce<br>
strength transverse rapture strength of the article, increase the production costs, and<br>
reduce the fracture toughness. This is especially important for tools used to machine<br>
hard work pieces where the machining results in a shearing action and the strength of the<br>
drill should be the greatest..<br>
The ceramic component preferably comprises about 60 to about 98 weight<br>
percent of the total weight of the cemented carbide material in each region. The carbide<br>
particles are embedded within a matrix of binder material that preferably constitutes<br>
about 2 to about 40 weight percent of the total material in each region. The binder<br>
preferably is one or more of Co, Ni, Fe, and alloys of these elements. The binder also<br>
may contain, for example, elements such as W, Cr, Ti, Ta, V, Mo, Nb, Zr, Hf, and C up<br>
to the solubility limits of these elements in the binder. Additionally, the binder may<br>
contain up to 5 weight percent of elements such as Cu, Mn, Ag, Al, and Ru. One skilled<br>
in the art will recognize that any or all of the constituents of the cemented carbide<br>
material may be introduced in elemental form, as compounds, and/or as master alloys.<br>
The core region 420 of the tool blank 400 is autogenously bonded to the<br>
outer region 410 at an interface 415. The interface 440 is shown in Figure 4(a) to be<br>
cylindrical, but it will be understood that the shapes of the interfaces of cemented carbide<br>
material regions of the composite rotary tools of the present invention are not limited to<br>
cylindrical configurations. The autogenous bond between the regions at the interface 415<br>
may be formed by, for example, a matrix of binder that extends in three dimensions from<br>
the core region 420 to the outer region 410, or vice versa. The ratio of binder to ceramic<br>
component in the two regions may be the same or different and may be varied between<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
the regions to affect the regions' relative characteristics. By way of example only, the<br>
ratio of binder to ceramic component in the adjacent regions of the composite tool blank<br>
30 may differ by 1 to 10 weight percent. The characteristics of the cemented carbide<br>
materials in the different regions of the composite rotary tools of the present invention<br>
may be tailored to particular applications.<br>
One skilled in the art, after having considered the description of present<br>
invention, will understand that the improved rotary tool of this invention could be<br>
constructed with several layers of different cemented carbide materials to produce a<br>
progression of the magnitude of one or more characteristics from a central region of the<br>
tool to its periphery. Thus, for example, a twist drill may be provided with multiple,<br>
coaxially disposed regions of cemented carbide material and wherein each such region<br>
has successively greater hardness and/or wear resistance than the adjacent, more centrally<br>
disposed region. Coolant channels may be provided in any of the regions or intersecting<br>
two or more regions. The method of the present invention provides great design<br>
flexibility in the design of extruded articles. Alternately, rotary tools of the present<br>
invention could be made with other composite configurations wherein differences in a<br>
particular characteristic occur at different regions of the tool.<br>
A major advantage of the composite cemented carbide rotary tools of the<br>
present invention is the flexibility available to the tool designer to tailor properties of<br>
regions of the tools to suit different applications. For example, the size, location,<br>
thickness, geometry, and/or physical properties of the individual cemented carbide<br>
material regions of a particular composite blank of the present invention may be selected<br>
to suit the specific application of the rotary tool fabricated from the blank. In addition,<br>
the coolant channels may be located in the desired locations and be helical, spiral, linear,<br>
or a combination of such shapes. Thus, for example, the stiffness of one or more<br>
cemented carbide regions of the rotary tool experiencing significant bending during use<br>
may be of a cemented carbide material having an enhanced modulus of elasticity; the<br>
hardness and/or wear resistance of one or more cemented carbide regions having cutting<br>
surfaces and that experience cutting speeds greater than other regions may be increased;<br>
and/or the corrosion resistance of regions of cemented carbide material subject to<br>
chemical contact during use may be enhanced.<br>
Figures 4(b) and 4(c) show additional embodiments of the present<br>
invention. These embodiments may additional comprise channels, such as coolant<br>
-9-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
channels. The embodiment of Figure 4(b) comprises a tube with internal regions of<br>
different cemented carbide grades. In this example, the rod 440 comprises an outer<br>
region 441 of a first cemented carbide, a first inner region 442 of a second cemented<br>
carbide, and an additional inner regions 443 that could comprise the same or different<br>
cemented carbides. The rod 440 could be produced, for example, by coextuding a set<br>
450 comprising a tube 451 filled with rods 452 and 453. Rods 452 may be formed from<br>
a cemented carbide that has at least one characteristic that differs from the rods 453, for<br>
example.<br>
By way of example only, additional embodiments of rotary tools of the<br>
present invention are shown in Figures 4 and 5. Figure 4 depicts a step drill 110<br>
constructed according to the present invention. The drill 110 includes a cutting portion<br>
112 including several helically oriented cutting edges 114. The drill 110 also includes a<br>
mounting portion 116 that is received by a chuck to mount the drill to a machine tool (not<br>
shown). The drill 110 is shown in partial cross-section to reveal three regions of<br>
cemented carbide materials that differ relative to one another with regard to at least one<br>
characteristic. A first region 118 is disposed at the cutting tip of the drill 110. The<br>
cemented carbide material from which region 118 is composed exhibits an enhanced<br>
wear resistance and hardness relative to a central region 120 forming the core of the drill<br>
110. The core region is of a cemented carbide material that exhibits an enhanced<br>
modulus of elasticity relative to the remaining two regions. The enhanced modulus of<br>
elasticity reduces the tendency of the drill 110 to bend as it is forced into contact with a<br>
work piece. The drill also includes an outer region 122 that defines the several helically<br>
oriented cutting edges 114. The outer region surrounds and is coaxially disposed relative<br>
to the core region 120. The outer region 122 is composed of a cemented carbide material<br>
that exhibits enhanced hardness and wear resistance relative to both the core region 120<br>
and the tip region 118. The cutting surfaces 114 that are defined by the outer region 122<br>
experience faster cutting speeds than cutting regions proximate to the drill's central axis.<br>
Thus, the enhanced wear resistance and hardness of the outer region 122 may be selected<br>
so that uniformity of wear of the cutting surfaces is achieved.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention also include additional methods of<br>
making composite cemented carbide articles. Embodiments include a method of forming<br>
a composite article by coextruding at least two composite materials comprising cemented<br>
carbides to form a green compact. The coextruding may be performed by direct or<br>
-10-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
indirect extrusion process. The feed chamber of the extruder is filled with two grades of<br>
materials, such as two grades of carbide powder and binder powder mixed with a plastic<br>
binder. The plastic binder material may be present in concentrations from about 33 wt.%<br>
to 67 wt.% and decreases the viscosity of the powder metal mixture to allow extrusion.<br>
The extrusion process for cemented carbides is well known in the art. In a<br>
typical extrusion process, metal powders are mixed with a plastic binder. Any typical<br>
plastic binder may be used such as plastic binders based upon benzyl alcohol, cellulose,<br>
polymers, or petroleum products. Typically, a high sheen mixing process is used to<br>
ensure intimate contact between the metal powders and the plastic binder.<br>
The metal/binder mixer may then be pumped by screw feeder through the<br>
extruder to produce an extruded product. Embodiments of the method of the present<br>
invention include coextrusion of at least two cemented carbide grades. The term<br>
coextrusion, as used herein, means that two materials are extruded simultaneously to<br>
form a single article incorporating both materials. Any coextrusion process may be used<br>
in the method of the present invention such as, pumping two grades of cemented carbide<br>
to separate sections of funnel or die wherein the two grades exit the die in intimate<br>
contact with each other.<br>
An embodiment of the coextrusion process is shown in Figure 6(a). The<br>
feed chamber 600 is filled with a rod 610 of a first grade of cemented carbide powder and<br>
a tube 620 of a second grade of cemented carbide powder. The rod 610 and the tube 620<br>
were individually formed by separate extrusion processes as known in art. In certain<br>
embodiments, the tube 620 may be extruded directly into the feed chamber 600. The rod<br>
610, formed in a separate extrusion process may then be inserted into the tube 620<br>
already in the feed chamber 600.<br>
In this embodiment of the extrusion process, a plunger (not shown) pushes<br>
the rod 610 and the tube 620 through the feed chamber and into the funnel 630. The<br>
funnel 630 reduces in cross-sectional area from the feed chamber to the die 640. The<br>
funnel 630 causes compaction and consolidation of the cemented carbide powders<br>
resulting in intimate contact between the rod 610 and tube 620 and formation of a green<br>
compact ("extruded material").<br>
In certain embodiments, the extrusion process may also include a channel<br>
die 650 incorporated between the funnel 630 and the die 640. The channel die comprises<br>
two wires 660 or the channel die may comprise other means for making internal channels<br>
-11-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
in the green compact. The wires 660 are connected to arms 670 which hold the wires<br>
660 so they may contact the extruded material. The wires 660 result in the formation of<br>
channels in the extruded material. The wires 660 may be made from any material<br>
capable of forming channels in the extruded material, such as, but not limited to, nylon,<br>
polymer coated metal wire, polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polyester, polyvinyl<br>
chloride, polypropylene, an aramid, Kevlar, polyetheretherketone, natural materials,<br>
cotton, hemp, and jute. Preferably in certain applications, such as for formation of<br>
helically oriented channels, the wire is a flexible wire. However, for linearly oriented<br>
channels and in some helical applications, rigid wires may be used. The channels may be<br>
used as coolant channels in rotary tools. The wires 660 may be used to form helically<br>
oriented channels, linearly oriented channels, or a combination thereof. A cross-section<br>
of the wire or other channel making component may be any shape, such as round,<br>
elliptical, triangular, square, and hexagonal.<br>
Helically oriented channels may be formed in the extruded material in<br>
embodiments where the extruded material rotates relative to the channel die 650. The<br>
. extruded material may be rotated by incorporating spiral serrations in the die 640. In<br>
Figure 6(c), extruded material 680 exits die 645 that includes helical serrations on the<br>
internal surface of the die 645. As the extruded material passes over the serrations, the<br>
extruded material is caused to rotate relative to the channel die (not shown).<br>
Alternatively, the die may rotate to cause the extruded material to rotate relative to the<br>
channel die. Other channel dies may be used, such dies comprising fixed helical coils<br>
wherein the extruded material is cause to rotate relative to the channel die in the same<br>
rotation as the helical coils, or any other channel forming means.<br>
The channel die may be a separate component or may be integral to the<br>
funnel, die, or other component in the extrusion system. The channel die may be capable<br>
of making at least one channel in the extruded material. The number and size of the<br>
channels may be limited by the size of the extruded material, the size of the channels, and<br>
the application for the ultimate use of the extruded material. In embodiments comprising<br>
a channel die comprising wires, the number of wires will correspond to the number of<br>
channels formed in the extruded material. For an rotary tool application, it may be<br>
preferable to have an equal number of channels as there will be flutes for example.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention may further include loading the<br>
feed chamber with at least two cemented carbide grades. At least one cemented carbide<br>
-12-<br><br>
WO 2007/001870	PCT/US2006/023238<br>
grade loaded in the feed chamber may be an extruded form of either a rod, tube, bar,<br>
strips, rectangles, gear profiles, star shapes, or any other shape that may be formed in an<br>
extrusion process. In rotary tool or roller applications, it may be preferable that at least<br>
one of the two cemented carbide grades be in the form of a rod shape and at least one<br>
cemented carbide in a shape of a tube. In other applications, the feed chamber may be<br>
filled with multiple tubes and/or multiple rods of different cemented carbide grades. If<br>
multiple rods are used, the extruded material may be formed with specific grades of<br>
cemented carbides in specific regions or randomly distributed throughout the cross-<br>
section of the extruded material.<br>
A further embodiment of the present invention may comprise extruding a<br>
cemented carbide grade to form an extruded green compact and pressing the extruded<br>
green compact with a second cemented carbide grade to form a pressed green compact.<br>
The extruded green compact may optionally comprise internal channels formed as<br>
described above, for example.<br>
Actual examples of application of the foregoing method to provide<br>
composite rotary tools according to the present invention follow.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in connection with<br>
certain embodiments, those of ordinary skill in the art will, upon considering the<br>
foregoing description, recognize that many modifications and variations of the invention<br>
may be employed. All such variations and modifications of the present invention are<br>
