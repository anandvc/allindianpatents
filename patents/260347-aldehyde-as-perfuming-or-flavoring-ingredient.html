Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of perfumery or flavor More particularly, it concerns a compound of formula.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
namely the 3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal<br>
The present invention concerns the use of said compound m the perfumery or m the flavor industry as well as the compositions or articles associated with said compound<br>
Prior art<br>
To the best of our knowledge, the 3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal is a new compound<br>
hi the pnor art it is possible to find only some structural analogues wherein only one alkyl group substitutes the carbon atom 4, m the cyclohexene nng Some of these analogues have been descnbed as being useful perfuming ingredients, such as the 3-(4-tert-butyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal (m EP 1054053) or the 3-(4-isopropenyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal (m JP 50094143)<br>
However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the pnor art documents reports or suggests that compounds having two alkyl substituents, on the carbon atom 4, may possess useful organoleptic properties, and all the less to have properties similar to that of the present compound (I)<br>
Description of the invention<br>
Surpnsmgly,  we  have  now  established  that  3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal of formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
possesses useful organoleptic properties, which have been found to be particularly useful and appreciated for the preparation of perfumes or flavors<br>
The use of the compound (I) m the field of perftimery represents a particularly appreciated embodiment of the invention<br>
The flavor of the invention's compoimd display citrus and aldehyde C9 type notes and has also a watermelon aspect<br>
The fragrance of 3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal is charactenzed by adehydic, Farenal® (2,6,10-tnmethyl-9-undecenal, ongin Symnse ag, D), green and amsic notes as well as by a very nice floral-hnden-verbena tree tonahty Moreover, a bottom note reminding of the odor of Scentenal® (8(9)-methoxy-tncyclo[5 2 10 (2,6)]decane-3(4)-carbaldehyde, ongm Firmemch SA, Switzerland) also charactenzes the odor of compound (I) The fragrance of compound (I) is very appreciated for its linden and verbena tonality<br>
As mentioned above, the invention concerns also the use of the invention's compound as perfuming or flavonng ingredients In other words it concerns a method to confer, enhance, improve or modify the odor or flavor properties of a perfuming or flavonng composition or of a perfumed or flavored article, which method compnses adding to said composition or article an effective amount of the compound of formula (I) By "use of the compoimd of formula (I)" it has to be understood here also the use of any composition containing compoimd (I) and which can be advantageously employed m perfumery or m flavors industry as active ingredients<br>
Said compositions, which m fact can be advantageously employed as perfuming or flavonng ingredient, are also an object of the present invention<br>
Therefore, another object of the present invention is a perfuming or flavonng composition compnsmg i)    as perfuming or flavonng ingredient, the compound of formula (I),<br>
ii)   at least one mgredient selected from the group consisting of a perfumery earner and a perfumery base, or at least one mgredient selected from the group consisting of a flavor earner and a flavor base, and 111) optionally at least one perfumery or flavor adjuvant<br>
By "perfumery or flavor earner" we mean here a matenal that is practically neutral from a perfumery or flavor point of view, i e that does not sigmficantly alter the organoleptic properties of perfuming or flavonng ingredients Said earner may be a liquid or a sohd<br>
As liquid earner one may cite, as non-limitmg examples, an emulsifying system, 1 e a solvent and a surfactant system, or a solvent commonly used in perfumery or flavors A detailed descnption of the nature and type of solvents commonly used m perfumery or flavor cannot be exhaustive However, one can cite as non-hmitmg examples solvents such as dipropyleneglycol, diethyl phthalate, isopropyl mynstate, benzyl benzoate, 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)-!-ethanol or ethyl citrate, which are the most commonly used As non-limitmg examples of solvents commonly used m flavors, one can cite compounds such as propylene glycol, tnacetme, tnethyl cifrate, benzylic alcohol, ethanol, vegetal oils or terpenes<br>
As solid earner one may cite, as non-limitmg examples, absorbing gums or polymers, or yet encapsulating matenals Examples of such matenals, for example, may compnse wall-forming and plasticizmg matenals, such as mono, di- or tnsacchandes, natural or modified starches, hydrocolloids, cellulose denvatives, polyvinyl acetates, polyvmylalcohols, protems or pectins, or yet the matenals cited m reference texts such as H Scherz, Hydrokolloids Stabilisatoren, Dickungs- und Gehermittel m Lebensmittel, Band 2 der Schnftenreihe Lebensmittelchemie, Lebensmittelquahtat, Behr's VerlagGmbH &amp; Co, Hamburg, 1996<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery or flavor base" we mean here a composition compnsmg at least one perfuming or flavonng co-ingredient<br>
By "perfuming or flavonng co-ingredient" it is meant here a compound, which is of current use m perfuming or flavonng preparation or composition to impart a hedomc effect hi other words such a co-ingredient, to be considered as being a perfuming or flavonng one, must be recognized by a person skilled m the art as being able to impart or<br>
modify m a positive or pleasant way the odor or taste of a composition, and not just as having an odor or taste<br>
The nature and type of the perfummg or flavoring co-mgredients present m the base do not warrant a more detailed description here, which in any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to intended use or application and the desired organoleptic effect. In general terms, these perfuming or flavormg co-mgredients belong to chemical classes as vaned as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, ethers, acetates, mtnles, terpene hydrocarbons, nitrogenous or sulphurous heterocyclic compounds and essential oils, and said perfuming co-mgredients can be of natural or synthetic ongm Many of these co-ingredients are m any case listed m reference texts such as the book by S Arctander, Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, 1969, Montclair, New Jersey, USA, or its more recent versions, or m other works of a similar nature, as well as in the abundant patent literature m the field of perfumery or flavor It is also understood that said co-mgredients may also be compounds known to release m a controlled manner vanous types of perfuming or flavonng compounds<br>
For the compositions which compnse both a perfumery earner and a perfumery base, other suitable perfumery earner, than those previously specified, can be also ethanol, water/ethanol mixtures, limonene or other terpenes, isoparaffms such as those known under the trademark Isopar® (ongm Exxon Chemical) or glycol ethers and glycol ether esters such as those known under the trademark Dowanol (ongm Dow Chemical Company)<br>
Generally speaking, by "perfumery or flavor adjuvant" we mean here an ingredient capable of imparting additional added benefit such as a color, a particular light resistance, chemical stability and etc A detailed descnption of the nature and type of adjuvant commonly used m perfiimmg or flavonng bases cannot be exhaustive, but it has to be mentioned that said ingredients are well known to a person skilled m the art<br>
An invention's composition consisting of the compound of formula (I) and at least one perflimery or flavor earner represents a particular embodiment of the invention as well as a perfuming or flavonng composition compnsmg the compound of formula (I), at<br>
least one perfumery or flavor earner, at least one perfumery or flavor base, and optionally at least one perfumery or flavor adjuvant<br>
Its is also understood here that, unless otherwise indicated or descnbed, any mixture resulting directly from a chemical synthesis, e g without an adequate punfication, m which the compound of the invention would be involved as a starting, intermediate or end-product could not be considered as a perfuming or flavonng composition according to the invention<br>
The perfuming or flavonng compositions according to the invention may be a simple mixture of the vanous co-mgredients and solvents, or be also m the form of a bi-phasic system such as an emulsion or microemulsion Alternatively, said perfuming compositions can be incorporated into a solid perfumery earner, as defined above In the case of flavonng bases, the latter may also be a simple mixture of flavonng ingredients or also m an encapsulated form as mentioned above Said encapsulation is well known to a person skilled m the art, and may be performed, for instance, using techniques such as spray-drymg, agglomeration or yet extrusion, or consists of a coating encapsulation, including coacervation and complex coacervation techniques<br>
Furthermore, the invention's compound can also be advantageously used m all the fields of modem perfumery to positively impart or modify the odor of a consumer product into which said compound (I) is added Consequently, a perfumed article compnsmg i)    as perfuming ingredient, at least one compound of formula (I) or an invention's<br>
composition, and ii)   a non-palatable consumer product base, is also an object of the present invention<br>
For the sake of clanty, it has to be mentioned that, by "non-palatable consumer product base" we mean here a non-edible consumer product, i e which is not intended to be introduced m the mouth, and which is compatible with perfuming mgredients In other words, a perfumed article accordmg to the invention compnses the functional formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a consumer product, e g a detergent or an air freshener, and an olfacttve effective amoimt of at least one mvention's compound<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the non-palatable consumer product do not warrant a more detailed descnption here, which m any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the nature and the desired effect of said product<br>
Examples of suitable non-palatable consumer products include solid or hquid detergents and fabnc softeners as well as all the other articles common m perfumery, namely perfumes, colognes or after-shave lotions, perfumed soaps, shower or bath salts, mousses, oils or gels, hygiene products or hair care products such as shampoos, body-care products, deodorants or antiperspirants, air fresheners and also cosmetic preparations As detergents there are intended applications such as detergent compositions or cleamng products for washing up or for cleamng various surfaces, e g intended for textile, dish or hard-surface treatment, whether they are intended for domestic or mdustnal use Other perfumed articles are fabnc refreshers, ironing waters, papers, wipes or bleaches<br>
Some of the above-mentioned consumer product bases may represent an aggressive medium for the invention compound, so that it may be necessary to protect the latter from premature decomposition, for example by encapsulation<br>
Moreover,   3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal  can  be  advantageously incorporated into a flavored article to positively impart, or modify, the taste of said article Consequently, a flavored article compnsmg i)    as flavonng ingredient, the compound of formula (I), or an invention's composition,<br>
and ii)   a foodstuff base, IS also an object of the present invention<br>
Suitable foodstuffs, e g foods or beverages, include teas, beverages, such as sodas or juice, or sweets or dairy products.<br>
For the sake of clanty, it has to be mentioned that, by "foodstuff base" we mean here an edible product, e g a food or a beverage Therefore, a flavored article accordmg to the invention compnses the functional formulation, as well as optionally additional benefit agents, corresponding to a desired edible product, eg a beverage, and a flavor effective amount of at least an invention's compound<br>
The nature and type of the constituents of the foodstuffs or beverages do not warrant a more detailed descnption here, which m any case would not be exhaustive, the skilled person being able to select them on the basis of its general knowledge and according to the nature of said product<br>
The proportions m which 3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal can be incorporated into the various aforementioned articles or compositions vary withm a wide range of values These values are dependent on the nature of the article to be perfumed or flavored and on the desired organoleptic effect as well as the nature of the co-mgredients m a given base when the compound according to the invention is mixed with perfuming or flavoring co-mgredients, solvents or additives commonly used m the art<br>
For example, m the case of perfuming compositions, typical concentrations are m the order of 0 1 % to 30 % by weight, or even more, of the invention's compound based on the weight of the composition into which they are incorporated Concentrations lower than these, such as in the order of 0 01% to 10% by weight, can be used when these compounds are incorporated into perfumed articles, percentage being relative to the weight of the article<br>
hi the case of flavoring compositions, typical concentrations are m the order of 0 1 ppm to 1000 ppm by weight, or even more, of the compound of the invention based on the weight of the consumer product into which they are incorporated Concentrations lower than these, such as m the order of 0 01 ppm to 200 ppm by weight, relative to the weight of the article, can be used when these compounds are incorporated into flavored articles<br>
The invention will now be descnbed m further detail by way of the following examples, wherein the abbreviations have the usual meaning m the art, the temperatures are indicated m degrees centigrade (°C), the NMR spectral data were recorded m CDCI3 (if not stated otherwise) with 400 MHz machine for 1H and at 100 MHz for 13C, the chemical displacement 5 are indicated in ppm with respect to the TMS as standard, the coupling constants J are expressed m Hz<br>

The addition of 100 parts by weight of 3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal to the above-descnbed perfuming composition imparted to the latter an enhanced volume and perceived diffusion altogether with a natural floral aspect Moreover the green Imden-like freshness was greatly accentuated m a very clean manner<br>
The addition of an equivalent amount of 3-(4-tert-butyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal to the above-descnbed composition would have imparted a more aldehydic, muguet direction<br>

The addition of 200 parts by weight of 3-(4,4-dimethyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal to the above-descnbed perfuming composition imparted to the fragrance of the latter a significantly greater presence, perceived diffusion, and a very mterestmg Imden/verbena top note<br>
If a same amoimt of 3-(4-tert-butyl-l-cyclohexen-l-yl)propanal had been added, instead of the invention's compound, the perfuming composition would have acquired more strength However the green, aldehydic notes, typical of said compound, would have also greatly accentuate the jasmimc notes rather than the verbena notes.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
