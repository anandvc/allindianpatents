Transponder tuning method and a transponder<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a manufacturing method for an antenna<br>
circuit comprising forming an inductance of a resonance circuit to the<br>
antenna circuit. The invention also relates to a method for tuning an antenna<br>
circuit which comprises an inductance of a resonance circuit, and a<br>
component comprising a chip impedance. The invention further relates to an<br>
antenna circuit which comprises an antenna impedance of a resonance<br>
circuit, and a component comprising a component impedance. The invention<br>
further relates to a transponder which comprises an inductance of a<br>
resonance circuit, and a component comprising a component impedance.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Antenna circuits are implemented, for example, in transponders for different<br>
applications. A transponder is usually a small-sized equipment which<br>
comprises an antenna circuit. The antenna circuit usually comprises a<br>
resonance circuit and may also comprise an antenna, or eg the coil of the<br>
resonance circuit operates as an antenna. The transponder may further<br>
comprise a chip to/from which information can be wirelessly stored/read. The<br>
information is stored into a memory of the chip or generated e.g. by a logical<br>
circuit of the chip upon request. The energy is usually externally provided to<br>
the transponder by the reader when information is to be stored into or read<br>
from the chip. The energy is supplied to the transponder as a radio frequency<br>
(RF) energy. The antenna of the transponder receives the energy. The<br>
antenna is part of the resonance circuit wherein the energy must have a<br>
certain frequency. In the transponder the received energy is usually stored to<br>
an energy storage such as a capacitor. The stored energy suffices for the<br>
information storage/reading operation when the resonance circuit and the<br>
transmission frequency of the reader are near each other i.e. the resonance<br>
circuit is tuned to the transmission frequency of the reader.<br>
There are different systems in which transponders are utilized. However, the<br>
transmission frequencies are not the same in every system. Therefore,<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/F12006/050051<br>
2<br>
different resonance frequencies are needed in transponders of different<br>
systems. Moreover, tolerances in the manufacturing processes of the<br>
transponders can affect that the resonance frequencies need to be tuned<br>
before the transponder is ready for use. For example, the input impedance of<br>
the chip may vary in different production batches. Further, the input<br>
impedances of the chips of different manufacturers may vary so largely that<br>
similar chips from different manufacturers can not be used with the same<br>
antenna circuit. Also the coil/antenna manufacturing and chip assembly<br>
processes may affect variations in the joint impedances which affect the<br>
resonance frequency of the transponder.<br>
There are also other factors which may affect the resonance frequency of the<br>
transponder. For example when the transponder is placed into a housing the<br>
material of the housing may change the resonance frequency. Further, the<br>
application in which the transponder will be used may affect to the resonance<br>
frequency. Some materials such as plastics have more effect to the<br>
resonance frequency than some other materials such as cardboard. When<br>
the transponder is operating at UHF area (Ultra High Frequencies) the<br>
resonance frequency may drop about 50—100 MHz on plastic application or<br>
about 10—20 MHz on cardboard application. The same phenomenon exists<br>
also on transponders operating at HF frequencies.<br>
There are some prior art tuning methods in which the inductance of the coil of<br>
the resonance circuit is changed by mechanically altering the coil. For<br>
example, a coil may have a number of short-circuits which can be broken to<br>
change the inductance of the coil. Hence, the transponder is measured and if<br>
it is not in resonance, one short-circuit is broken. After that the resonance<br>
frequency is measured again and another short-circuit is broken if necessary.<br>
This kind of tuning method is time consuming and needs extra production<br>
steps.<br>
Another drawback in prior art is that the same antenna and/or coil can not be<br>
used in different kinds of systems but each system needs a specific antenna<br>
and/or coil.<br><br>

Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved method for tuning the resonance<br>
frequency of the resonance circuit, an antenna circuit, and a transponder.<br>
The invention is based on the idea that the antenna circuit is provided with<br>
multiple of connection areas for a component such as a chip so that at least<br>
two such connection areas result a different resonance frequency when the<br>
component is assembled to such connection areas. Therefore, the selection<br>
of connection areas for connecting a component to the antenna circuit can be<br>
used to select the resonance frequency for the antenna circuit. To put it more<br>
precisely, the manufacturing method according to the present invention is<br>
primarily characterised in that the method comprises forming a multiple of<br>
connection areas for connecting a component to the antenna circuit, at least<br>
two of said multiple of connection areas being part of the resonance circuit.<br>
The tuning method according to the present invention is primarily<br>
characterised in that the antenna circuit comprises a multiple of connection<br>
areas for connecting a component to the antenna circuit, at least two of said<br>
multiple of connection areas being part of the resonance circuit, wherein the<br>
method comprises selecting at least one connection area for the chip<br>
amongst said at least two of said multiple of connection areas. The antenna<br>
circuit according to the present invention is primarily characterised in that the<br>
antenna circuit further comprises a multiple of connection areas for<br>
connecting a component to the antenna circuit the component comprising a<br>
component impedance, at least two of said multiple of connection areas<br>
being part of the resonance circuit, The transponder according to the present<br>
invention is primarily characterised in that the antenna circuit further<br>
comprises a multiple of connection areas for connecting the component to<br>
the transponder, at least two of said multiple of connection areas being part<br>
of the resonance circuit.<br>
The invention provides advantages compared to prior art methods, antenna<br>
circuits and transponders. When producing the transponders according to the<br>
present invention it is not necessary to measure the resonance frequency of<br>
all the transponders of a production batch but only one or few of ihem<br>
because the materials and the process have a quite uniform quality. The<br>
other transponders are produced according to the measurements of the one<br>
or few samples of the transponders of the production batch. In other words,<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/FI2006/050051<br>
4<br>
the connection areas for the chip are selected according to the<br>
measurements and all the other transponders of the same batch can be<br>
manufactured accordingly. When a different resonance frequency is needed,<br>
another connection area(s) is/are selected for the chip. The antenna circuit<br>
can comprise many connection areas in a way thai the difference between<br>
the smallest and highest resonance frequency that can be achieved by the<br>
selection of the connection area of the chip can be very large. Thus, the<br>
same antenna circuits can be used in many different transponders.<br>
Therefore, bigger manufacturing volumes of similar antenna circuits can be<br>
achieved. The transponders can also be mass tailored according to the<br>
needs of customers who will use the transponders in their products, for<br>
example. One further advantage to mention is that the tuning is simpler than<br>
in prior art methods.<br>
Same antenna circuit can be used in different technology chip<br>
attachment lines. High quality lines produce transponders with smaller<br>
parasitic capacitances, which will increase the resonance frequency. .<br>
Many connection areas enable to produce optimized transponders in<br>
many production lines.<br>

inductance and the connection areas of a transponder<br>
according to the present invention,<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/FI2006/050051<br>
5<br>
In Fig. 1a there is depicted an example of a antenna circuit 1<br>
comprising a coil 2 of a resonance circuit and connection areas 3.1, 3.2<br>
(such as connection pads, jointing pads, etc) for a component 4 (shown<br>
as a dotted square in Fig. 1a). The component 4 is, for example, a chip<br>
or a module comprising a chip. It is obvious that there may be more<br>
than one component and multiple connection areas for one or more of<br>
the plurality of components, as well. The antenna circuit 1 is formed on<br>
a substrate 5.1. This kind of antenna circuit is especially suitable for HF<br>
frequencies, ie frequencies between about 3 MHz to 30 MHz, typically<br>
about 13,56 MHz. The coil 2 has a number of loops 2.1 to achieve a<br>
certain basis inductance. At the first end 2.2 of the coil 2 there are a<br>
number of short conductors 2.3 connected to the coil 2 by a conductor<br>
2.4. At the other end of the each conductor 2.3 there is a connection<br>
area 3.1 for the component 4. Near each of these connection areas 3.1<br>
there is another connection area 3.2 for the component 4. Those other<br>
connection areas 3.2 are formed at the end of another set of<br>
conductors 2.5 which in turn are electrically connected together by a<br>
conductor 2.6. This conductor 2.6 is connected to the other end 2.7 of<br>
the coil by a wire 2.8, for example. The component 4 has two or more<br>
connection elements, such as leads, connection pads, etc for<br>
connecting the component 4 to the other electronic circuitry. When the<br>
component 4 is eg bonded at the connection elements to the<br>
connection areas of the transponder, the component is fixed to the<br>
transponder and usually no other fixing means are necessary.<br>
The component 4 can be connected to any of the pair of adjacent<br>
connection areas 3.1, 3.2. Inside the component 4 there are usually<br>
rectifier diodes and other semiconductor components (e.g. switching<br>
transistors, memory, etc., not shown in Fig. 1a) which typically affect<br>
that there exists a capacitive input impedance. The connection areas<br>
3.1, 3.2 for the component 4 are selected according to the resonance<br>
frequency designed for the transponder 5. In the embodiment of Fig. 1a<br>
the highest resonance frequency can be achieved by joining the<br>
component to the pair of connection areas which form the longest coil<br>
i.e. the connection areas which are at the right end of the conductors<br>
2.6 in Fig. 1a, because the area of the coil becomes smaller in this<br>
alternative. Respectively, the lowest resonance frequency can be<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/FI2006/050051<br>
6<br>
achieved by joining the component 4 to the pair of the connection<br>
areas which form the shortest coil i.e. the leftmost pair of connection<br>
areas in Fig. 1a, because the area of the coil becomes larger in this<br>
alternative.<br>
In Fig. 1b another example of the antenna circuit 1 according to the<br>
present invention is shown. This kind of antenna circuit is especially<br>
suitable for UHF frequencies, ie frequencies over 300 MHz up to<br>
3000 MHz, typically around 900 MHz. In this embodiment the coil 2 is<br>
electrically as a dipole antenna having two radiators 6.1, 6.2. In both<br>
radiators 6.1, 6.2 of the dipole antenna there are lengthening coils 1.1,<br>
1.2 which increase the electric length of the dipole antenna. At the<br>
other end of the lengthening coils 1.1, 1.2 there are conductors 2.4, 2.6<br>
and a number of connection areas 3.1, 3.2 in different locations of the<br>
conductors 2.4, 2.6. The connection areas 3.1, 3.2 allow the selection<br>
of the connection area of the component 4 in the similar way than in<br>
the above described example of Fig. 1a. The selection of the<br>
connection area affects to the inductance of the resonance circuit<br>
which is mainly formed by the dipole antenna and the capacitance<br>
between the conducting points of the component 4.<br>
In principle there are at least two ways to affect to the inductance to the<br>
antenna circuit. One is to change the operational (electric) length of the<br>
antenna and another way is to change serial inductance of the antenna<br>
circuit. It is also possible to use both of them.<br>
In Fig. 1c yet another example of the antenna circuit 1 according to the<br>
present invention is shown. This kind of antenna circuit is also<br>
especially suitable for UHF frequencies. The coil or antenna 1 is<br>
electrically as a dipole antenna having two radiators 6.1, 6.2. At one<br>
end of the radiators 6.1, 6.2 there are conductors 2.4, 2.6 and a<br>
number of connection areas 3.1, 3.2 in different locations of the<br>
conductors 2.4, 2.6. The connection areas 3.1, 3.2 allow the selection<br>
of the connection area for the component 4 in the similar way than in<br>
the above described examples of Figs. 1 a and 1 b. The selection of the<br>
connection area affects to the area of the loop which is formed by the<br>
selected connection areas 3.1, 3.2, the conductors 2.4, 2.6 and the<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/FI2006/050051<br>
7<br>
loop conductor 2.9. Therefore, the inductance of the resonance circuit<br>
is also varied according to the selection of the connection areas 3.1,<br>
3.2 for the component 4.<br>
Fig. 2 depicts an equivalent circuit of an example of the antenna circuit<br>
1 of Fig. 1b according to the present invention. There are the<br>
inductances L1, L2 which consist of the radiators 6.1, 6.2 and the<br>
lengthening coils 1.1, 1.2. There is also some resistance in the coils,<br>
radiators and conductors which is represented as resistors R1, R2 in<br>
Fig. 2. The resistances consist inter alia of loss resistance and<br>
radiation resistance. Each of the conductors connecting two connection<br>
areas 3.1, 3.2 also have some inductance L3—L8. The component 4<br>
has some capacitive input impedance R, C which affect the operation<br>
of the circuit of the transponder. The energy generator 7 represents the<br>
reader or some other device which produces the RF energy for the<br>
transponder. Although the generator 7 is shown as connected to the<br>
antenna in Fig. 2, the generator 7 is not connected to the transponder 5<br>
in normal operation but the energy is radiated from the generator to the<br>
transponder 5.<br>
Mathematicaliy the effect of the selection of the connection points to<br>
which the component is assembled can be presented, for example, by<br>
the following equation:<br><br>
In the equation the term fc represents the resonance frequency, C<br>
represents the capacitance of the input impedance of the component,<br>
the term Lant represents the inductance of the radiators, and the term<br>
E,Lconnectionpoint represents the sum of the inductances of the<br>
connection points which are selected for connecting the component 4<br>
to the antenna circuit 1.<br>
Fig. 3 depicts some measurement results of an example embodiment<br>
of the present invention. In Fig. 3 the curve 301 represents the<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/FI2006/050051<br>
8<br>
normalised performance as a function of selected connection points (IC<br>
location) at a first frequency area (869 MHz) when the antenna circuit<br>
is in free air ie it is not attached to the application material. In this non-<br>
restrictive example five selectable locations have been measured. It<br>
can be seen that in this example the best results are achieved when<br>
the component is connected to the fifth pair of connection areas. The<br>
curve 302 represents the normalised performance as a function of<br>
selected connection points at the first frequency area (869 MHz) when<br>
the antenna circuit is covered by a plastic plate. In this alternative the<br>
best results are achieved when the component is connected to the first<br>
pair of connection areas. The curve 303 represents the normalised<br>
performance as a function of selected connection points at a second<br>
frequency area (902MHz-928MHz) when the antenna circuit is in free<br>
air. In this alternative the third pair of connection areas gives the best<br>
results. The curve 304 represents the normalised performance as a<br>
function of selected connection points at the second frequency area<br>
(902MHz-928MHz) when the antenna circuit is covered by a plastic<br>
plate. In this alternative the first pair of connection areas gives the best<br>
results.<br>
A number of prior art manufacturing methods can be used in manufacturing<br>
the antenna circuits of the present invention. It should also be mentioned that<br>
the different parts of the resonance circuit on the antenna circuit 1, such as<br>
coils 2, radiators 6.1, 6.2, conductors 2.4, 2.6, connection areas 3.1, 3.2, can<br>
be manufactured in the same phase. Therefore, no extra steps are needed<br>
for providing the tuning possibility for the transponder 5. The component 4<br>
can also be joined to the antenna circuit 1 by using soldering, adhesive or<br>
any suitable method known as such. The component 4 can also be formed<br>
as a module which is then attached to the transponder. Such a module<br>
comprises, for example, a substrate in a strap form in which the necessary<br>
electrical connections are arranged for electrically connecting the chip of the<br>
module to the transponder. This kind of module containing the chip can also<br>
be called as a strap or a strap module, for example.<br>
The resonance frequency can vary in large scale. For example, the<br>
transponder 5 can be designed to operate at 869 MHz systems and at<br><br>
WO 2006/087423	PCT/FI2006/050051<br>
9<br>
915 MHz systems which are common frequencies in UHF frequency area.<br>
The invention is also applicable at HF frequencies, typically 13,56 MHz.<br>
There are many application areas for the present invention. As a non-limiting<br>
example of the application areas the transponder can be made for so called<br>
RFID applications (Radio Frequency Identification}.<br>
