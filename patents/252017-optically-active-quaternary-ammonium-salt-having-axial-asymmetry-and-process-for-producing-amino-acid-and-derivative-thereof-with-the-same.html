				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Optically active quaternary ammonium salt having axial asymmetry and<br>
process for producing cramino acid and derivative thereof with the same<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an optically active quaternary<br>
ammonium salt having axial asymmetry and a method for producing the<br>
same. The present invention further relates to a method for producing<br>
an optically active α-amino acid and derivatives thereof, by using this<br>
optically active quaternary ammonium salt having axial asymmetry as a<br>
phase-transfer catalyst.<br>
Background Art<br>
orAlkyl-α-amino acids represented by the formula<br>
H2NCH(R)COOH are very important naturally occurring amino acids.<br>
Most of the α-alkyl-α-amino acids exist in animals, plants,<br>
microorganisms or the like in the L.form having a L-configuration at a<br>
position carbon, and the L-form constitutes a polypeptide chain. On the<br>
other hand, the D-form exists in plants, fungi or microorganisms as a<br>
non-protein compound. Furthermore, a, α -dialkyl-α-amino acids<br>
represented by a formula H2NC(R)(R')COOH are compounds that are<br>
recently gaining attention because of their unique functions such as<br>
being stereochemically stable and being not susceptible to enzymatic<br>
hydrolysis by protease when the compound is incorporated into a peptide.<br>
Regarding the above-described respects, see Bellier, B, et al., J. Med.<br>
Chem., vol. 40, p. 3947, 1997; and Mossel, E. et al., Tetrahedron<br><br>
Asymmetry, vol. 8, p. 1305, 1997. The compounds can be used, for<br>
example, as peptides having an enhanced activity, effective enzyme<br>
inhibitors, and chiral building blocks for synthesizing compounds having <br>
various biological activities. Such a,α-dialkyl-α-amino acids have been<br>
examined to be prepared by catalystic asymmetric reaction, but at<br>
present, no effective method for preparing the same has been found out.<br>
For example, the significance of chiral phase-transfer catalysts,<br>
which allow stereoselective alkylation of glycine derivatives, is increased<br>
in the field of process chemistry because of its easy application. A large<br>
number of researches as to design of phase-transfer catalysts have been<br>
conducted by using mainly cinchona alkaloid derivatives until now and<br>
several useful methods have been reported (e.g., see Shioiri, T. et al.,<br>
Stimulating Concepts in Chemistry, edited by Vogtle, F. et al.,<br>
WILEY-VCH: Weinheim, p.123, 20001 and O'Donnell, M. J., Aldrichimica<br>
Acta, vol. 34, p.3, 2001). However, when such phase-transfer catalysts<br>
are used, various problems are caused such as use of a halogen-based<br>
solvent, a long time reaction, or the necessity of low temperature<br>
conditions. In particular, for synthesizing α,α-dialkyl-α-amino acids as<br>
described above, chiral phase-transfer catalysts derived from such<br>
cinchona alkaloid are" hot very useful.<br>
The present inventors have prepared an optically active<br>
quaternary ammonium salt having axial asymmetry, and clarified that it<br>
can be used as a phase-transfer catalyst for synthesizing<br>
stereoselectively α-amino acids as described above (see Japanese<br>
Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2001-48866; Japanese Laid-Open<br>
Patent Publication No. 2003-81976; and Ooi, T. et al., J. Am. Chem. Sα,<br>
vol. 122, p.5228, 2000). For example, a spiro-compound represented by<br><br>
the following formula is very useful for asymmetric double alkylation of<br>
glycine derivatives and asymmetric monoalkylation of α-alkyl-α-amino<br>
acid derivatives (e.g., alanine derivatives):<br><br>
(where PhF3 represents 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl group). However, a large<br>
number of processes are required in order to prepare such spiro catalysts,<br>
and for example, when chiral binaphthol, which is easily available, is<br>
used as the starting raw material, as many as eleven processes are<br>
required only to prepare the structural portion on the left side of the<br>
catalyst. Thus, preparation takes time and labor, and results in high<br>
cost, which are large drawbacks.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a chiral<br>
phase-transfer catalyst having a simplified structure that can be<br>
produced by a fewer number of processes.<br>

The quaternary ammonium salt represented by the formula (I)<br>
can be produced by reacting a compound represented by the following<br>
formula (II): <br>
(where R1, R1', R2, R2',R3, R3', R4, R4', R5, R5", R6, and R6' are the same as<br>
defined in the formula (I), and Z is a halogen atom) with a secondary<br>
amine represented by the following formula (III):<br>
H%8	(III)<br>
(where R7 and R8 are the same as defined in the formula (I)) in an<br>
organic solvent in the presence of an acid scavenging agent.<br>
The compound of the formula (II) can be prepared easily from, for<br>
example, easily available l,l'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid (see Seki,<br>
M. et al., Synthesis, 2000, p. 1677) in a known process as described in the<br>
following Scheme 1 (see Ooi, T. et al., J. Org. Chem., vol.68, p.4577,<br>
2003). The l,l'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid may be either the<br>
(S)-form or (R)-form.<br><br><br>
The following is a more specific explanation based on Scheme 1<br>
above. First, dicarboxylic acid (l) is converted to a corresponding<br>
diisopropylester (2) using isopropyl bromide, a catalyst BxuN-HSCU and<br>
KF2H2O. The obtained compound (2) is treated with magnesium<br>
bis(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperamide) (hereinafter, referred to as<br>
Mg(TMP)2), and then BR2 is added thereto to give<br>
3,3'-dibromo-l,l'-dinaphthyl-2,2'-dicarboxilyc acid ester (3). Then, the<br>
obtained compound (3) and 3,4,5-trifluorophenyl boronic acid are<br>
subjected to the Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction in the presence<br>
of palladium acetate, triphenylphosphine and potassium carbonate to<br>
give 3,3'-bis(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)-l,l'-binaphthyl-2,2'-dicarboxylic acid<br>
ester (4). Furthermore, this (4) is reduced with LiAlEU to obtain alcohol<br>
(5) and the obtained alcohol (5) is treated with PBR3 so that dibromide (6),<br>
which corresponds to the formula (II) above, can be obtained.<br>
On the other hand, a large number of the secondary amines of the<br>
formula (III) above are commercially available, and therefore can be<br><br>
obtained easily, so that they can be selected as appropriate.<br>
Examples of an organic solvent used in the process for producing<br>
the compound of the formula (I) by reacting the compound of the formula<br>
(II) with the formula (III) include nitrile solvents (e.g., acetonitrile,<br>
propionitrile), ether solvents (e.g., dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, isopropyl<br>
ether, diethyl ether, dimethoxyethane, 2-methoxyethyl ether), alcohol<br>
solvents (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol,<br>
tert-butanol). In the present invention, acetonitrile is particularly<br>
preferable. Examples of an acid scavenging agent include inorganic<br>
bases such as potassium carbonate, sodium carbonate, potassium<br>
hydrogencarbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate).<br>
In the reaction, the secondary amine of the formula (III) is<br>
preferably used in 1 to 4 equivalents, more preferably 2 to 3 equivalents<br>
to the compound of the formula (II). The acid scavenging agent is<br>
preferably used in 1 to 4 equivalents, more preferably about 1 to 2<br>
equivalents to the compound of the formula (II). The compound of the<br>
formula (II) and the secondary amine of the formula (III) are reacted<br>
with each other in the presence of the acid scavenging agent in an<br>
appropriate organic solvent with stirring. The reaction temperature is<br>
preferably from room temperature to the boiling point of the organic<br>
solvent, and more preferably the reaction is performed under heating<br>
reflux. The reaction time is preferably 30 minutes to 24 hours, more<br>
preferably 6 to 12 hours. In this case, the organic solvent is preferably<br>
used 5 to 50 times, more preferably 5 to 30 times the amount of the<br>
compound of the formula (II) in the ratio of volume (mL)/weight (g).<br>
After the reaction is finished, the reaction mixture is extracted with<br>
dichloromethane, dichloroethane, or carbon tetrachloride, and isolated<br><br>
and purified by silica gel column chromatography, so that the compound<br>
of the formula (I) can be obtained. Alternatively, the reaction mixture<br>
may be used, as it is, as a phase-transfer catalyst in the method for<br>
producing α-amino acid derivatives, which will be more specifically<br>
described later.<br>
Thus obtained compound of the formula (I) in which X" is a halide<br>
anion has a pure form with respect to axial asymmetry, and can be used<br>
as a phase-transfer catalyst. Here, "pure with respect to axial<br>
asymmetry" means that among the stereoisomers based on axial<br>
asymmetry, the rate of the presence of one specific isomer is higher than<br>
that of other isomers. Preferably, the rate of the presence of the one<br>
specific isomer is 90% or more, more preferably 95% or more, and even<br>
more preferably 98% or more.<br>
Furthermore, the compound of the formula (I) in which X" is a<br>
halide anion can be made into a compound in which the halide anion is<br>
converted to SCN", HSO4" or HF2", for example, through the following<br>
process.<br>
First, a method for producing the compound of the formula (I) in<br>
which X" is SCN" or HSO4" will be described.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) obtained in the above-described<br>
manner in which X" is a halide anion is dissolved in, for example, a<br>
suitable second organic solvent according to the method described in<br>
Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002-173492 and mixed with<br>
a saturated aqueous solution of an alkali metal salt of thiocyanic acid so<br>
that the halide anion of X" is converted to SCN".<br>
Examples of the second organic solvent that can be used for this<br>
exchange include dichloromethane, chloroform, dichloroethane,<br><br>
tetrahydrofuran, methyl t-butyl ether, diisopropyl ether, and ethyl<br>
acetate. Examples of the alkali metal salt of thiocyanic acid include<br>
potassium thiocyanate and sodium thiocyanate.<br>
For example, by mixing the compound of the formula (I) in which<br>
X" is a halide anion with an alkali metal salt of thiocyanic acid in a<br>
solution under a relatively mild condition such as under room<br>
temperature so as to come into contact, the reaction thereof can proceed<br>
easily, and the reaction product (e.g., the compound of the formula (I) in<br>
which X" is SCN") can be obtained in a quantitative yield.<br>
Furthermore, by reacting the compound of the formula (I) in<br>
which X" is SCN" with a concentrated nitric acid solution, X" can be<br>
converted easily from SCN" to HSO4'.<br>
By further reacting thus obtained compound of the formula (I) in<br>
which X' is HSO4" with an alkali metal fluoride (e.g., potassium fluoride,<br>
sodium fluoride or lithium fluoride), a compound represented by the<br>
formula (la): <br>
(where R1, R1', R2, R2',R3, R3', R4&gt; R4-; R5&gt; R^ R6&gt; an(i RG- are t^e same as<br>
defined in the formula (I)) can be obtained, which can be used as a<br>
catalyst, for example, in a reaction of a silyl enol ether and a carbonyl<br>
compound (aldol reaction).<br>
Examples of silyl enol ether used in the aldol reaction include a<br>
trialkylsilyl enol ether. A trialkylsilyl enol ether can be prepared in<br><br>
advance by reacting a chlorosilane such as trimethylsilyl chloride and<br>
triethylsilyl chloride with a carbonyl compound (e.g., ketone derivatives<br>
such as 2-butanone, 4-penten-2-one, diethyl ketone, acetophenone,<br>
propiophenone, butyronaphtone, cyclohexanone, 1-oxoindan, 1-tetralone<br>
or 2-tetralone) in the presence of a base.<br>
In addition to the carbonyl compound (the above-described ketone<br>
derivatives), which is a precursor of a silyl enol ether, examples of the<br>
carbonyl compound that can be reacted with a silyl enol ether used in the<br>
aldol reaction, include aldehyde compounds such as acetylaldehyde,<br>
propionaldehyde, butylaldehyde, isobutylaldehyde, isovaler aldehyde,<br>
capronaldehyde, dodecylaldehyde, palmitinaldehyde, stearinaldehyde,<br>
acrolein, crotonaldehyde, cyclohexanecarbaldehyde, benzaldehyde,<br>
anisaldehyde, nicotinaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde, oc-naphthaldehyde, and<br>
P - naphthaldehy de.<br>
With respect to such a silyl enol ether and such a carbonyl<br>
compound, the compound represented by the formula (la) is used as a<br>
catalyst in the aldol reaction so that the stereoselectivity in the reaction<br>
can be controlled.<br>
Next, a method for producing the compound of the formula (I) in<br>
which X' is HF2" will be described.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) obtained in the above-de scribed<br>
manner in which X' is a halide anion is first brought in contact with an<br>
ion-exchange resin so that a first intermediate is produced.<br>
As the ion-exchange resin, any ion-exchange resin can be selected<br>
by those skilled in the art. Specific examples of the ion-exchange resin<br>
that can be used include Amberlyst A26 (OH) (manufactured by<br>
ORGANO CORPORATION).<br><br>
The compound of the formula (I) in which X' is a halide anion can<br>
be brought in contact with an ion-exchange resin by dissolving the<br>
compound of the formula (I) in which X" is a halide anion in a suitable<br>
third solvent and passing this solution through a column filled with the<br>
ion-exchange resin. As the third solvent that can be used for such a<br>
contact, alcohol solvents are preferable. Specific examples of alcohol<br>
solvents include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, and<br>
normal propyl alcohol, although not limited thereto.<br>
There is no limitation regarding the amounts of the compound of<br>
the formula (I) in which X" is a halide anion and the third solvent that<br>
are used in this contact, and they can be set as appropriate by the those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, the first intermediate is produced.<br>
Then, the obtained first intermediate is neutralized with a<br>
hydrogen fluoride aqueous solution preferably without removing the<br>
solvent.<br>
There is no limitation regarding the amount of the hydrogen<br>
fluoride aqueous solution used in the present invention. In view of<br>
increasing the productivity, preferably, the amount is selected so that<br>
hydrogen fluoride is reacted in an amount at least equivalent to that of<br>
the compound of the formula (I) in which X" is a halide anion. Thus, the<br>
first intermediate is neutralized, and a compound represented by the<br>
formula (lb): <br><br>
in which X" is further converted from the halide anion to HF2" can be<br>
precipitated in the solution.<br>
Thereafter, the compound of this formula (lb) can be easily<br>
isolated by removing the solvent using means usually used by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Thus obtained compound of the formula (lb) can be utilized as a<br>
catalyst for producing a nitroalcohol that is diastereoselectively and<br>
enantioselectively controlled.<br>
Next, a method for producing α-amino acid derivatives using the<br>
quaternary ammonium compound of the present invention represented<br>
by the formula (I) as a phase-transfer catalyst will be described.<br>

and<br>
 R18-W	(V)<br>
(where R18 is the same as defined in the formula (VI), and W is a<br>
functional group having a leaving ability).<br>
Examples of the medium used in this process include benzene,<br>
toluene, xylene, ethyl ether, isopropyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, and<br>
dioxane. Alternatively, the medium may be a two-phase medium<br>
containing water and a medium of these which is immiscible with water.<br>
The medium may be used in a volume (mL)/weight (g) ratio of a factor,<br>
preferably of 5 to 30, more preferably 8 to 25 to the compound of the<br>
formula (IV).<br>
Examples of the inorganic base used in this process include<br>

phase-transfer catalyst, preferably in 0.001 mol % to 0.1 mol %, more<br>
preferably 0.005 mol % to 0.05 mol % to 1 mol of the compound of the<br>
formula (IV). Thus, the phase-transfer catalyst used in the present<br>
invention has a high activity, and therefore by using the catalyst at only<br>
a small amount to 1 mole of the compound of the formula (IV), a desired<br>
optically active oc-amino acid and derivatives thereof can be produced.<br>
In the present invention, in addition to such a phase-transfer<br>
catalyst, achiral quaternary ammonium salts such as tetrabutyl<br>
ammonium bromide (TBAB) may be also used in the reaction system<br>
simultaneously. For example, TBAB functions as a cocatalyst in the<br>
reaction system in the present invention to improve the yield of an<br>
cramino acid and its derivatives obtained, and also can further reduce<br>
the amount of the phase-transfer catalyst represented by the formula (I)<br>
used in the present invention. The amount of TBAB that can be used in<br>
the present invention is preferably 0.005 mol % to 0.1 mol %, and more<br>
preferably 0.01 to 0.06 mol % to 1 mol of the compound of the formula<br>
(IV).<br>
The alkylation process is performed at a suitable temperature<br>
between -30°C to room temperature, preferably -20°C to 0°C, in air,<br>
preferably in an argon atmosphere. This process is performed with<br>
stirring over a suitable period until an alkylation reaction proceeds to a<br>
sufficient extent. The reaction time is preferably 30 min to 48 hours,<br><br>
more preferably 1 hour to 24 hours.<br>
According to the method of the present invention using the<br>
compound of the formula (I) of the present invention as described above,<br>
an optically active compound of the formula (VI) can be obtained in a<br>
high yield and high optical purity. Here, "high optical purity" refers to<br>
at least 80% ee, preferably at least 85% ee, more preferably 90% ee, and<br>
even more preferably at least 95% ee.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention, a method for<br>
producing an optically active α-amino acid is provided.<br>
In the present invention, an optically active α-amino acid can be<br>
produced by performing, for example, either one of the following<br>
procedures, using the optically active compound of the formula (VI)<br>
(optically active α-amino acid derivative) that is obtained by the<br>
above-described method.<br>
In a first method, the imino group ( R14 R15C=N-) moiety of the<br>
optically active compound of the formula (VI) (optically active α-amino<br>
acid derivative) that is obtained by the above-described method is<br>
hydrolyzed under an acidic condition (imine acidic hydrolysis process).<br>
Examples of the acid used in the imine acidic hydrolysis process include<br>
inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid) and organic<br>
acids containing tribasic acid (e.g., acetic acid, citric acid). More<br>
specifically, the imine acidic hydrolysis process proceeds by treating the<br>
compound of the formula (VI) in a suitable medium (e.g.,<br>
tetrahydrofuran or toluene) at a suitable temperature (e.g., room<br>
temperature) using an aqueous solution of the acid as described above.<br>
As a result, an ester derivative of amino acid in which the terminal<br>
amino group is liberated can be obtained as an acidic hydrolysis product.<br><br>
Then, the ester derivative of amino acid (acidic hydrolysis<br>
product) obtained by the above-described process is subjected to a<br>
hydrolysis reaction, if necessary, under acidic conditions stronger than<br>
the inline acidic hydrolysis or under basic conditions. Thus, a desired<br>
amino acid in which the terminal of the acidic hydrolysis product (i.e., an<br>
ester group (-CO2 R17) in the acidic hydrolysis product) becomes<br>
carboxylic acid can be obtained.<br>
Alternatively, in a second method, the process opposite to the<br>
method described above is adopted. That is to say, the ester group<br>
(-CO2 R17) in the optically active compound of the formula (VI) (optically<br>
active α-amino acid derivative) obtained in the above-described<br>
alkylation reaction is first hydrolyzed under basic conditions (ester basic<br>
hydrolysis process). In this ester basic hydrolysis process, an alkali<br>
aqueous solution such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution can be used.<br>
By such hydrolysis, a basic hydrolysis product in which the terminal of<br>
the compound of the formula (VI) (i.e., an ester group (-CO2 R17) in the<br>
compound of the formula (VI)) becomes carboxylic acid can be obtained.<br>
Then, the imino group ( R14 R15C=N-) moiety of the above-obtained<br>
basic hydrolysis product is hydrolyzed under an acidic condition (imine<br>
acidic hydrolysis process). Examples of the acid used in the imine acidic<br>
hydrolysis process include inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid,<br>
phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid) and organic acids including tribasic acid<br>
(e.g., acetic acid, citric acid). More specifically, the imine acidic<br>
hydrolysis process proceeds by treating the basis hydrolysis product in a<br>
suitable medium (e.g., tetrahydrofuran or toluene) at a suitable<br>
temperature (e.g., room temperature) using an aqueous solution of the<br>
acid as described above. As a result, a desired amino acid in which the<br><br>
terminal amino acid is liberated can be obtained.<br>
In the present invention, in the case where an amino acid is<br>
produced from the compound of the formula (VI), either the first method<br>
or the second method may be used, and either can be selected arbitrarily<br>
by those skilled in the art, according to the specific structure of the<br>
amino acid to be actually produced and other production conditions.<br>
In this manner, a desired optically active α-amino acid can be<br>
produced efficiently and optionally without limitations on its structure.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be more specifically<br>
described by way of examples, but is not limited thereby.<br>
In the following examples, 1H NMR spectrum was measured on a<br>
JEOL JNM-FX400 (400 MHz) spectrometer and a JMTO400/54/SS (400<br>

Industrial Applicability<br>
The present invention provides a chiral phase-transfer catalyst<br>
having a simpler configuration. This phase-transfer catalyst can be<br>
produced by a fewer number of processes than for a conventional<br>
compound, which reduces the cost. Such a phase-transfer catalyst is<br>
very useful for synthesis of oc-alkyl-cramino acid and derivatives thereof<br>
and a,α-dialkyl-α-amino acid and derivatives thereof. The amino acid<br>
and derivatives thereof play a special role in the design of a peptide<br>
having enhanced characteristics as an effective enzyme inhibitor and as<br>
a chiral structure block for synthesis of compounds having various<br>
biological activities. Therefore, the present invention is useful for<br>
development of novel foods or pharmaceuticals.<br><br>
