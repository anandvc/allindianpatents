				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a modular hybrid electric vehicle. Strict environmental regulations and increasing petrol and diesel costs have spurred extensive research activities worldwide to explore alternatives to the conventional IC engines. One option is the use of electric energy to drive a vehicle.<br>
Conventionally, two types of electric vehicles have been proposed: (1) Pure electric vehicles and (2) Hybrid electric vehicles.<br>
The pure electric vehicles, operate purely on electric energy. This energy is provided by a battery. The battery, in turn, is charged by another external source of electric power.<br>
Hybrid electric vehicles are classified into two categories:<br>
(i) Parallel Hybrids<br>
An IC engine operates in parallel with the electric propulsion unit (motor and battery)  to<br><br>
provide the required energy. While the motor drives the vehicle, the IC engine is also mechanically coupled to the transmission, to step in whenever the battery charge is not sufficient to run the vehicle. This arrangement is called a parallel hybrid system.<br>
(ii) Series Hybrids.<br>
An IC engine charges a battery through a generator.   The battery supplies power  to the motor to run the vehicle.  This arrangement  is called a series hybrid system.<br>
Drawbacks of existing electric vehicles.<br>
The drawback with the pure electric vehicle is that the battery has to be constantly recharged. The re-charging is done off-line by plugging the system into the electric mains supply.<br>
Parallel hybrid vehicles have lower weight than the series hybrid vehicles since a separate generator may not be required for the latter. They however need more elaborate transmission systems.<br><br>
The series hybrid vehicle is simpler in design than the parallel hybrid vehicle . However, in addition to the drawback of its greater weight, the series hybrid vehicle also suffers from the drawback of lower power capability.<br>
"Towed" propulsion systems have also been proposed. In this case a trailer, disposed outside the vehicle, is linked thereto and the trailer is towed along by the vehicle. The trailer contains a power plant consisting of an IC engine and a generator. Whenever the battery, in the vehicle, runs down, the generator is used to recharge the battery. Evidently, this system is inconvenient and cumbersome, as such vehicles are difficult to drive, maneuver in traffic and park. These vehicles are not perceived as normal cars.<br>
The modular hybrid electric vehicle proposed herein has an entirely different and original approach, as will be clear from the following description.<br>
The modular hybrid electric vehicle, according to<br><br>
this invention, comprises a first module permanently housed within the vehicle, said module being provided with an electric motor powered by a battery for driving the vehicle; a second portable module, being an electric charging unit, provided with an IC engine coupled to a generator, for re-charging the battery whenever necessary; means for mounting the second module on the vehicle and for unmounting the same, whenever required; and means for securely fastening the second module, in position, whenever mounted on the vehicle.<br>
This invention will now be described by referring to the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation, one of various possible embodiments of the modular hybrid electric vehicle proposed herein,<br>
Fig.l illustrating a view of a pure electric vehicle accommodating the first module<br>
Fig.2 separately illustrating the charging unit (second module)<br>
Fig.3  illustrating the charging unit   (second<br><br>
module) being mounted on  the vehicle V<br>
and Fig.4  illustrating the general  layout of the embodiment .<br>
The pure electric vehicle comprises  a first module provided with an electric motor M powered by a battery B for driving the vehicle.<br>
A second module is an electric charging unit. This is provided with an IC engine E (with fuel tank and other fittings) coupled to a generator G, for re-charging the battery B whenever the battery runs down during use.<br>
Means  for mounting the said charging unit U on the vehicle and for unmounting the  same are provided.  In the embodiment  illustrated,  such means  comprise, for example,  a simple ramp R on which the said unit U can be drawn into the vehicle for mounting the same within the vehicle; or  lowered down from the vehicle for unmounting the same. The charging unit is preferably wheeled to enable it to be trundled up and down the ramp R. Fastening  means  are provided  for  securely<br><br>
fastening the charging unit once mounted on the the vehicle. Preferably, such fastening means comprise an electro-mechanical coupling for preventing the second module, once mounted and fastened in position, from being unmounted, inadvertently.<br>
The arrangement is such that whenever the battery charge is nearing a predetermined threshold value, the charging unit can be mounted on the vehicle for re-charging the battery. After re-charging is complete, the charging unit can be unmounted, if desired.<br>
The battery comprised in the first module is mounted at the bottom of the vehicle, to maintain a low centre of gravity. In addition, a spare tyre is also included in the vehicle. The vehicle can also be equipped for off-line charging from the utility,  as a convenience to the customer.<br>
The second module will, preferably, be mounted on the vehicle in the the boot.<br>
The IC engine provided for the charging unit will<br><br>
be made to run at a constant speed to operate in its  most efficient regime.  This  feature will reduce emission and increase fuel economy.<br>
The advantages of this invention are mainly these:<br>
*The vehicle does not carry the additional load of the charging unit all the time, but only when it is mounted  on the vehicle.   This  significantly improves the range in the pure electric mode.<br>
*The recharging is conveniently done when the vehicle is in motion, so much so that the driver of the vehicle does not have to bring the vehicle to a halt and spend time for the battery to be re-charged. The down time is, therefore, practically what it takes to mount and unmount the charging unit.<br>
*The charging units may be obtained by users from special service providers situated at various well distributed places. The time taken for mounting the unit on to the vehicle can be similar to that reguired for re-fuelling a conventional car at a fuel station, including waiting time.<br><br>
The charging unit can be picked up by the user at one place and can be handed over to the service provider at another place, after its purpose is served.<br>
*Power reguirements for normal acceleration performance and standard accessory loads are met.<br>
Acceptably good performance in both pure electric and hybrid modes.<br>
♦Better fuel economy and low emission when compared to conventional vehicles.<br>
♦Option of users to time-share less number of charging units  for more number of vehicles, which can be a very useful feature for fleet vehicles.<br>
♦Option of user to have a captive charging unit which can also be used off-line as a standby generator for domestic use during power failures.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specification are of description and not of limitation, there being no intention in the use of such terms and expressions of excluding any eguivalents of the<br><br>
features illustrated and described, but it is understood that various other embodiments of this invention are possible without departing from the scope and ambit thereof.<br><br><br>
