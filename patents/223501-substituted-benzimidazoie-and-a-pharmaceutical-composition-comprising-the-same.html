Description<br>
Substituted benziimidazoles<br>
The invention relates to novel substituted benzimidazoles, a process for their preparation and use thereof as pharmaceuticals.<br>
The application WO 94/12478 describes, inter alia, benzimidazole derivatives ^wfiicTi inhibit blood platelet aggregation. NFKB is a heterodimeric transcription factor which can activate a large number of genes which code, inter alia, for proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, TNFa or IL-6. NFKB is present in the cytosdl of cells, complexed with its naturally occurring inhibitor IKB. The stimulation of cells, for example by cytokines, leads to the phosphorylation and subsequent proteolytic degradation of IKB. This proteolytic degradation leads to the activation of NFKB, which subsequently migrates into the nucleus of the cell and there activates a large number of proinflammatory genes.<br>
In disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarct, Alzheimer's disease or atherosclerosis, NFKB is activated beyond the normal extent. The inhibition of NFKB is also of benefit in cancer therapy, since it is employed there for the reinforcement of the cytostatic therapy. It was possible to show that pharmaceuticals such as glucocorticoids, salicylates or gold salts, which are employed in rheumatic therapy, intervene in an inhibitory manner at various points in the NFKB-activating signal chain or interfere directly with the transcription of the genes.<br>
The first step in the signal cascade mentioned is the degradation of IKB. This phosphorylation is regulated by the specific IKB kinase. To date, no inhibitors are known which specifically inhibit IKB kinase.<br>
In the attempt to obtain active compounds for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, asthma, cardiac infarct, "Alzheimer's disease, carcinomatous disorders (potentiation of cytotoxic therapies) or atherosclerosis, it has now been found that the benzimidazoles according to the invention are strong and very specific inhibitors of IKB kinase.<br><br>

The term "halogen" is understood as meaning fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. The term "(Ci-C6)-alkyl" is understood as meaning hydrocarbon radicals whose carbon chain is linear or branched and contains 1 to 6 carbon atoms. The term "Co-alkyl" is understood as meaning a covalent<br><br>
nethyl-2-naphthylmethyl, by one or more {Ci-C8)-alkoxy radicals, in<br>
^articular {Ci-C4)-alkoxy radicals, benzyl radicals and nap hthy I methyl<br>

and	4-fluorobenzyl,	3,4-dichlorobenzyl,	pentafluorobenzyl,<br>
rifluoromethylbenzyl radicals, for example 3- and 4-trifluoromethylbenzyl or 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl.<br>
n monosubstituted phenyl radicals, the substituent can be located in the '-position, the 3-position or the 4-position. Disubstituted phenyl can be substituted in the 2,3-position, the 2,4-position, the 2,5-position, the 2,6-^osition, the 3,4-position or the 3,5-position. In trisubstituted phenyl adicals, the substituents can be located in the 2,3,4-position, the 2,3,5-Dosition, the 2,4,5-position, the 2,4,6-position, the 2,3,6-position or the 3,4,5-position.<br>
The explanations for the aryl radicals apply accordingly to divalent arylene adicals, for example to phenylene radicals which can be present, for example, as 1,4-phenylene or as 1,3-phenylene.<br>
Dhenylene-(Ci-C6)-alkyl is in particular phenylenemethyl (-C6H4-CH2-) and 3henyleneethyl, (Ci-C6)*alkylenephenyl is in particular methylenephenyl ;-CH2-C6H4-). Phenylene-(C2-C6)-alkenyl is in particular phenyleneethenyl and phenylenepropenyl.<br>
The expression "heteroaryl having 5 to 14 ring members" represents a ■adical of a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic system having 5 to 14 ring members, which contains 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 heteroatoms as ring members. Examples of heteroatoms are N, 0 and S. If a number of heteroatoms are :ontained, these can be identical or different. Heteroaryl radicals can ikewise be monosubstituted or polysubstituted, preferably monosubstituted, disubstituted or trisubstituted, by identical or different -adicals from the group consisting of (Ci-Cs)-alkyl, in particular (C1-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-C8)-alkoxy, in particular (C-|-C4)-alkoxy, halogen, nitro, -N(R )2, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, hydroxy-(Ci-C4)-alkyl such as hydroxymethyl or 1-hydroxyethyl or 2-hydroxyethyl, methylenedioxy, formyl, acetyl, cyano, hydroxycarbonyl, aminocarbonyl, (C1-C4)-alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl, phenoxy,<br><br>

Heteroaryl having 5 to 14 ring members preferably represents a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic radical which contains 1, 2, 3 or 4, in particular 1, 2 or 3, identical or different heteroatoms from the group consisting of N, O and S and which can be substituted by 1, 2, 3 or 4, in particular 1 to 3, identical or different substituents from the group consisting of (C-|-Ce)-alkyl, (Ci-Ce)-alkoxy, fluorine, chlorine, nitro, -N(R }2, trifluoromethyl, hydroxyl, hydroxy-(Ci-C4)-alkyl, (Ci-C4)-alkoxycarbonyl, phenyl, phenoxy, benzyloxy and benzyl. Heteroaryl particularly preferably represents a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic radical having 5 to 10 ring members, in particular a 5-membered or 6-membered monocyclic aromatic radical which contains 1, 2 or 3, in particular 1 or 2, identical or different heteroatoms from the group consisting of N, 0 and S and can be substituted by 1 or 2 identical or different substituents from the group consisting of (C-|-C4)-alkyl, halogen, hydroxyl, -N(R )2, (C-|-C4)-alkoxy, phenyl, phenoxy, benzyloxy and benzyl.<br>
The expression "heterocycle having 5 to 12 ring members" represents a monocyclic or bicyclic 5-membered to 12-membered heterocyclic ring which is partly saturated or completely saturated. Examples of heteroatoms are N, O and S. The heterocycle is unsubstituted or substituted on one or more carbon atoms or on one or more heteroatoms by identical or different substituents. These substituents have been defined above for the radical heteroaryl. In particular, the heterocyclic ring is monosubstituted or polysubstituted, for example monosubstituted, disubstituted, trisubstituted or tetrasubstituted, on carbon atoms by identical or different radicals from the group consisting of (Ci-Cs)-alkyl, for example (Ci-C4)-alky1, (Ci-Cs)-alkoxy, for example (C-i-C4)-alkoxy such as methoxy, phenyl-(Ci-C4)-alkoxy, for example benzyloxy, hydroxyl, oxo, halogen, nitro, amino or trifluoromethyl and/or it is substituted on the ring nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring by (d-CsJ-alkyl, for example (Ci-C4)-alkyl such as methyl or ethyl, by optionally substituted phenyl or phenyl-(C-|-C4)-alkyl, for example benzyl. Nitrogen heterocycles can also be present as N-oxides or as quaternary salts.<br>
Examples of the expressions heteroaryl having 5 to 14 ring members or heterocycle having 5 to 12 ring members are radicals which are derived from pyrrole, furan, thiophene, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, isoxazole, thiazole, isothiazole, tetrazole, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, 1,2,3,5-oxathiadiazole-2-<br><br>

Particularly preferred radicals are 2- or 3-pyrrolyl, phenylpyrrolyl such as 4- or 5-phenyl-2-pyrrolyl, 2-furyl, 2-thienyl, 4-imidazoiyl, methylimidazoiyi, for example 1-rnerhyl-2-, -4- or -5-imidazolyl, 1,3-thiazot-2-yl, 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl, 4-pyridyl, 2-, 3- or 4-pyridyl-N-oxide, 2-pyrazinyl, 2-, 4- or 5-pyrimidinyl, 2-, 3- or 5-indolyl, substituted 2-indolyl, for example 1-methyl-, 5-methyl-, 5-methoxy-, 5-benzyloxy-, 5-chioro- or 4,5-dimethyl-2-indolyl, 1-benzyl-2- or -3-indolyl, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-indolyl, cyclohepta[b]-5-pyrrolyl, 2-, 3- or 4-quinolyl, 1-, 3- or 4-isoquinolyl, 1-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3-isoquinolyl, 2-quinoxalinyl, 2-benzofuranyl, 2-benzothienyl, 2-benzoxazolyl or benzothiazolyl or dihydropyridinyl, pyrrolidinyl, for example 2- or 3-(N-methylpyrrolidinyl), piperazinyl, morpholinyl, thiomorpholinyl, tetrahydrothienyl or benzodioxolanyl. The structural formula of a-amino acids is as follows:<br><br>
The a-amino acids differ from one another by the radical R, which in the context of the present application is described as a "characteristic radical"<br>
g<br>
of an amino acid. In the case where R is the characteristic radical of an amino acid, the characteristic radicals employed are preferably those of the following naturally occurring a-amino acids: glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine, glutamine, lysine, histidine, arginine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Those particularly preferred are histidine, tryptophan, serine, threonine, cysteine, methionine, asparagine, glutamine, lysine, arginine, glutamic acid and aspartic acid. Preferred characteristic radicals of an amino acid which are furthermore employed as the radical R are also non-naturally occurring amino acids such as 2-aminoadipic acid, 2-aminobutyric acid, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid, 2,4-diaminobutyric acid, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-1-carboxylic acid, 1,2,3,4-tetranydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic    acid,    2-aminopime!ic    acid,<br><br>
ihenylglycine, 3-(2-thienyl)alanine, 3-(3-thienyl)alanine, sarcosine, 2-(2-<br>

^J-methylisoleucine, 6-N-methyllysine, N-methylva!ine, norvaline,<br>

In the case of natural but also of non-naturally occurring amino acids which have a functional group such as amino, lydroxyl, carboxyl, mercapto, guanidyl, imidazoJyl or indolyl, this group can also be protected.<br>
Suitable protective groups for this are preferably the N-protective groups customarily used in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the jrethane type, benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenyl-Dxycarbonyl (Fmoc), altyloxycarbonyl (Aloe) or of the acid amide type, in particular formyl, acetyl or trifluoroacetyl, and of the alkyl type, for example<br>
9<br>
benzyl. In the case of an imidazole radical in R , for example, the sulfonic acid derivative of the formula IV employed for the sulfonamide formation is used as a protective group of the imidazole nitrogen, which can be removed again, in particular in the presence of bases such as sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
The starting substances for the chemical reactions are known or can be easily prepared by methods known from the literature.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula I and/or a stereoisomeric form of the compounds of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt of the compounds of the formula I, which comprises a)       reacting a compound of the formula IV<br><br><br>
in which Pg is a suitable protective group (e.g. methyl ester), an<br>
8	9<br>
amide group or a hydroxyl group and Z, R and R are as defined in formula II, with an acid chloride or an activated ester of the compound of the formula III<br><br>
where D1  is -COOH or sutfonyihafogen and R   and R   are as defined in formula I, in the presence of a base or, if appropriate, of a dehydrating agent in solution and, after removal of the protective group, converting into a compound of the formula I, or b)       reacting a compound of the formula IVa<br><br>
8	9<br>
in which R and R are as defined in formula II and E is an N-amino protective group, with its carboxyl group coupled via an intermediate chain L to a polymeric resin of the formula PS, a compound of the formula V<br><br>
resulting, which, after selective removal of the protective group E, is reacted with a compound of the formula III, where R and R are as defined in formula I, in the presence of a base or, if appropriate, of a dehydrating agent to give<br><br><br>
a compound of the formula VI<br>
and converting the compound of the formula VI, after removal of the support material, into a compound of the formula I, or c)       reacting a compound of the formula V, after selective removal of the protective group E, with a compound of the formula VII<br><br>
where Di is -COOH or sulfonylhalogen and RX is halogen and RY is a radical -NO2 or -NH-E and E is a protective group, to give a compound of the formula VIII<br><br>
and then reacting the compound of the formula VIM with a compound of the formula IX<br><br>
in which R is as defined in the compound of the formula I, to give an intermediate compound of the formula Via<br><br><br>
then either converting the intermediate compound of the formula Via into a compound of the formula I after removal of the support material or reducing it, for example, with tributylphosphine to give a compound of the formula VI and converting into a compound of the formula I after removal of the support material, or d) converting a compound of the formula I into a physiologically tolerable salt.<br>
In process variant a), the acid functions of the compounds of the formula IVa are provided with a protective group Pg; this selective carboxyfic acids derivatization is carried out according to methods such as are described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Org, Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1. In process variant b), the amino functions of the starting compounds of the formula IVa are provided with a protective group E; this selective amino groups derivatization is carried out according to methods such as are described in Houben-Weyl "Methoden der Org. Chemie" [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1.<br>
A suitable protective group Pg preferably used for this is the carboxyl protective groups customary in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the alkyl ester type, such as methyl, ethyl, tert-butyl, isopropyl, benzyl, fluorenylmethyl, allyl, aryl ester type, such as phenyl, amide type, such as amide or benzhydrylamine. Suitable protective groups E used for this are preferably the N-protective groups customary in peptide chemistry, for example protective groups of the urethane type, such as benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) and allyloxycarbonyl (Aloe) or of the acid amide type, in particular formyl, acetyl or trifluoroacetyl of alkyl type such as benzyl.<br>
The (trimethylsilyl)ethoxycarbonyl (Teoc) group has also proven particularly suitable for this (P. Kocidnski, Protecting Groups, Thieme Verlag 1994).<br><br>
Starling materials used for the preparation of the benzimidazole derivatives of the formula III are preferably 2,3- and 3,4-diaminobenzoic acids and aryl-or heteroarylaldehydes, which are reacted at 145°C in the presence of nitrobenzene as a solvent. The acids mentioned are furthermore reacted with methyl or ethyl imidates, which are prepared from the corresponding arylnitriles or heteroaryl nit riles in a Pinner reaction.<br>
For the condensation of the compounds of the formula IV with those of the formula III, the coupling methods which are well-known per se to the person skilled in the art are advantageously used (see, for example, Houben-Weyl, Methoden der Organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry], Volume 15/1 and 15/2, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, 1974). Suitable condensing agents or coupling reagents are compounds such as carbonyldiimidazole, carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC), 0-((cyano(ethoxycarbonyl)methylene)-amino)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TOTU) or propane-phosphonic anhydride (PPA).<br>
The condensations can be carried out under standard conditions. During the condensation, as a rule it is necessary for the non-reacting amino groups present to be protected by reversible protective groups. The same applies to carboxyl groups not involved in the reaction, which during the condensation are preferably present as (Ci-Ce)-alkyl esters, benzyl esters or tert-butyl esters. Amino group protection is unnecessary if the amino groups are still present in the form of precursors such as nitro groups or cyano groups and are only formed by hydrogenation after the condensation. After the condensation, the protective groups present are removed in a suitable manner. For example, NO2 groups (guanidino protection in amino acids), benzyloxycarbonyl groups and benzyl groups in benzyl esters can be removed by hydrogenation. The protective groups of the tert-butyl type are removed acidically, while the 9-fluorenylmethoxy-carbonyl radical is removed by secondary amines.<br>
The polymeric support designated in the formulae V and VI by PS is a crosslinked polystyrene resin having a linker designated as the intermediate chain L. This linker carries a suitable functional group, for example amine, known, for example, as Rink amide resin, or an OH group, known, for example, as Wang resin or Kaiser's oxime resin). Alternatively,<br><br>
other polymeric supports such as glass, cotton or cellulose having various intermediate chains L can be employed.<br>
The intermediate chain designated by L is covalently bonded to the polymeric support and allows a reversible, amide-like or ester-like bond with the compound of the formula IVa, which remains stable during the further reaction on the bonded compound of the formula IVa; but under strongly acidic reaction conditions, e.g. mixtures with trifluoroacetic acid, releases the group located on the linker again. The release of the desired compound of the formula I from the linker can be carried out at various positions in the reaction sequence.<br>
A. General procedure for the coupling of protected aminocarboxylic acids of the formula IVa to the solid support according to procedure b):<br>
The synthesis was carried out in reactors each having a reaction volume of<br>
15	ml. Each of the reactors was filled with 0.179 g of Rink amide AM resin<br>
(Fmoc-Rink amide AM/Nova-Biochem; loading 0.56 mmol/g; i.e.<br>
0.1 mmoUreactor). For the removal of the Fmoc protective group from the<br>
resin, a 30% strength piperidine/DMF solution was metered into each<br>
reactor and the mixture was shaken for 45 minutes (min). It was then<br>
filtered and the resin was washed 3 times with dimethylformamide (DMF).<br>
For the coupling of the protected amino acid, a 0.5 molar solution of the corresponding Fmoc-amino acid (0.3 mmol in DMF), a solution of HOBt (0.33 mmol in DMF) and a solution of DIC (0.33 mmol in DMF) were each added to the resin thus prepared and the mixture was shaken at 35°C for<br>
16	hours (h). The resin was then washed with DMF a number of times.<br>
To check the coupling, a few resin beads were removed and subjected to a KAISER test; in all cases the test was negative.<br>
The removal of the Fmoc protective group was carried out, as mentioned above, using 30% strength piperidine/DMF solution.<br>
For the coupling of the benzimidazolecarboxylic acids, a 0.1 molar solution of the corresponding 4- or 5-substituted acid (0.4 mmol in DMF); a 0.5 molar solution of the coupling reagent TOTU (0.44 mmol in DMF) and a 0.5 molar solution of DIPEA (0.6 mmol in DMF) were added and the mixture was shaken at 40°C for 16 hours. It was then washed a number of times with DMF.<br><br>
To check the reaction, a few beads of resin were again removed and subjected to a KAISER test.<br>
For the removal of the desired substances from the solid support, the resin was washed a number of times with dichloromethane. The cleavage solution (50% dichloromethane and 50% of a mixture of 95% TFA, 2% H2O, 3% triisopropylsilane) was then added and the mixture was shaken at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to dryness. The residue was precipitated with diethyl ether and filtered.<br>
The solid residues usually contained the desired products in high purity or were fractionated, for example, on a reverse phase (eluent: A: H2O/0.1% TFA, B: acetonitrile/0.1% TFA) using preparative high-pressure liquid chromatography. Lyophilization of the fractions obtained yielded the desired products.<br>
The preparation of physiologically tolerable salts of compounds of the formula I capable of salt formation, including their stereoisomeric forms, is carried out in a manner known per se. With basic reagents such as hydroxides, carbonates, hydrogencarbonates, alkoxides and also ammonia or organic bases, for example trimethyl- or triethylamine, ethanolamine or triethanolamine or alternatively basic amino acids, for example lysine, ornithine or arginine, the carboxylic acids form stable alkali metal, alkaline earth metal or optionally substituted ammonium salts. If the compounds of the formula I contain basic groups, stable acid addition salts can also be prepared using strong acids. For this, both inorganic and organic acids such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, methanesulfonic, benzenesulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic, 4-bromobenzenesutfonic, cyclohexyi-amidosulfonic, trifluoromethylsulfonic, acetic, oxalic, tartaric, succinic or trifluoroacetic acid are suitable.<br>
The invention also relates to pharmaceuticals which comprise an efficacious amount of at least one compound of the formula I and/or of a physiologically tolerable salt of the compounds of the formula I and/or an optionally stereoisomeric form of the compounds of the formula I, together with a pharmaceutical^ suitable and physiologically tolerable excipient, additive and/or other active compounds and auxiliaries.<br><br>
On account of the pharmacological properties, the compounds according to the invention are suitable for the prophylaxis and therapy of all those disorders in whose course an increased activity of IkB kinase is involved. These include, for example, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis (in the case of inflammation), osteoarthritis, Alzheimer's disease, carcinomatous disorders (potentiation of cytotoxic therapies), cardiac infarct, cardiac insufficiency, acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina pectoris), septic shock, acute and chronic kidney failure, stroke or atherosclerosis.<br>
The pharmaceuticals according to the invention are in general administered orally or parenterally. Rectal, inhalative or transdermal administration is also possible.<br>
The invention also relates to a process for the production of a pharmaceutical, which comprises bringing at least one compound of the formula I into a suitable administration form using a pharmaceutically suitable and physiologically tolerable excipient and, if appropriate, further suitable active compounds, additives or auxiliaries.<br>
Suitable solid or pharmaceutical preparation forms are, for example, granules, powders, coated tablets, tablets, (micro)capsules, suppositories, syrups, juices, suspensions, emulsions, drops or injectable solutions, and preparations having protracted release of active compound, in whose preparation customary auxiliaries, such as excipients, disintegrants, binders, coating agents, swelling agents, glidants or lubricants, flavorings, sweeteners and solubilizers are used. Frequently used auxiliaries which may be mentioned are magnesium carbonate, titanium dioxide, lactose, mannitol and other sugars, talc, lactoprotein, gelatin, starch, cellulose and its derivatives, animal and vegetable oils such as cod liver oil, sunflower, groundnut or sesame oil, polyethylene glycol and solvents such as, for example, sterile water and mono- or polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably produced and administered in dose units, each unit containing as active constituent a certain dose of the compound of the formula I according to the invention. In the case of solid dose units such as tablets, capsules, coated tablets or suppositories, this dose can be up to approximately 1000 mg, preferably from approximately 50 mg to 300 mg and in the case of injection solutions<br><br>
in ampoule form up to approximately 300 mg, preferably from approximately 10 mg to 100 mg.<br>
For the treatment of an adult patient weighing approximately 70 kg, depending on the efficacy of the compound according to formula I, daily doses of approximately 20 mg to 1000 mg of active compound, preferably from approximately 100 mg to 500 mg, are indicated. Under certain circumstances, however, even higher or lower daily doses may be appropriate. The administration of the daily dose can be carried out both by single administration in the form of an individual dose unit or else of a number of smaller dose units and by multiple administration of subdivided doses at specific intervals.<br>
As a rule, final products are determined by mass-spectroscopic methods (FAB-, ESI-MS). Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, RT means room temperature (22-26°C). Abbreviations used are either explained or correspond to the customary conventions.<br>
