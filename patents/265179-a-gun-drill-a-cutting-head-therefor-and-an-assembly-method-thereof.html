GUN-DRILL<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a gun-drill assembly having a detachably secured cutting-head, and a single, straight flute.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,304,816 discloses a multi-section drill, separable from its driving means, which uses a coupling mechanism of a mating undercut arrangement in the form of a helix on corresponding male and female ends of the sections to coaxially join the sections together, detachably securing a cutting-head (driven section) in a shank (driving section) of the drill. The driving section (shank) comprises a hollow cylindrical sleeve on a driving end thereof; an undercut in the sleeve in coaxial relationship therewith; two non-parallel edge surfaces on the undercut, one edge having a helix thereon, while the other surface is flat throughout its full length and perpendicular to the rotational axis of the tool; and a back taper on the helix. The driven section (cutting-head) comprises a generally cylindrical body, an undercut on the body forming a cylindrical section thereon; an enlarged coaxial<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-2-<br>
flange on the cylindrical section; two non-parallel edge surfaces on the enlarged flange, one edge having a helix thereon, while the other surface is flat throughout its full length and perpendicular to the rotational axis of the tool; and a back taper on the helix. Cooperation of the flange on the cutting-head and the undercut in the shank forms a compound locking and driving means, as the flange is firmly engaged between the two non-parallel surfaces of the driving portion, while the cylindrical surface of the cutting-head is piloted in the hollow sleeve of the driving portion, so that the two flute surfaces on the driving portion and the cutting-head are mutually aligned.<br>
In order to achieve positive lock together with accurate rotational positioning, the mating surfaces of '816 must be ground to exacting tolerances. However, even if these surfaces are initially precisely fitted, deformation during work may cause dimensional variations, and because there is no definite rotational stop to prohibit over rotation, the parts can rotate relative to each other, especially under working loads, thereby losing their rotational alignment, leading to over-tightening, difficulty in removing the tip, and disturbance to the flow of fluid and chips. Additionally, since the cutting-head is inserted into the driving section, a clearance fit has to exist between the cylindrical surface of the cutting-head and the hollow sleeve of the driving section, thereby preventing precise axial alignment between the two parts.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 3,153,356 and Re. 26,452 disclose a multi-section gun-drill tool in which the tool may be extended by threading sections coaxially together; the threads are helical in form with a specified helix angle range for locking the male and female threads to each other as the means for coaxially aligning the tool sections. A front shoulder of the cutting-head cooperates with an abutment on the shank, with the tolerances between these two surfaces being exceedingly important, since they limit the turning of the cutting-head threads into the threaded counter-bore of the shank. However, lack of positive stopping and torque-transmitting<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-3-<br>
means can cause the problems mentioned above, i.e., loss of rotational alignment, over-tightening, difficulty in removing the tip, and disturbance to the flow of fluid and chips. Additionally, since axial alignment of the cutting-head and the shank relies on the exacting tolerances between the shoulder of the cutting-head and the abutment on the shank, precise axial alignment between the two parts is difficult to achieve.<br>
Another example of detachable tip gun-drill is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 2,346,546 which shows an arrangement for extending the length of the tool by slip fitting a formed male section into a correspondingly sized and shaped female section. Positive torque-transmission and rotational alignment are achieved through a cross-pin which is inserted transversely to the axis of rotation of the gun-drill, into cross-bores passing through the tip and the shank. However, cutting-heads (or tips) made of exceptionally hard materials, such as ceramics or sintered hard metal composition, are difficult and expensive to cross-drill. Additionally, such pins complicate installation and replacement of the cutting-head in the shank.<br>
U. S. Pat. No. 5,971,673 discloses a twist drill having a detachable cutting tip, the drill having fluid conduits extending through the tool body and the cutting tip. To connect the cutting portion to the tool body, the cutting portion and tool body are converged longitudinally so that the projections enter the front flutes. Then, the cutting portion is rotated relatively to the tool body, to align the front flutes with the rear flutes while causing the projections to enter the recesses and form therewith a bayonet, with a support surface of the cutting tip abutting a front surface of the tool body. However, the drill disclosed in '673 cannot provide sufficient axial and lateral support required by gun-drills, where the cutting tip must support and guide the shank, aligning it both axially and laterally, to assure drilling a straight bore. Furthermore, the connection method disclosed in '673 cannot be applied to cutting-tools having a single flute.<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-4-<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a single fluted gun-drill having a detachably secured cutting-head that significantly reduces or overcomes the aforementioned disadvantages, while facilitating quick and simple replacement of the cutting-head.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A gun-drill 20 in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention is shown in Fig. 1. The gun-drill 20 has a direction of rotation R around a longitudinal axis of rotation A defining a front-to-back direction, and comprises a cutting-head 22 detachably secured to a shank 24 at a shank forward end 24F. A single, straight flute 26 extends axially along the shank 24 and the cutting-head 22, and comprises leading and trailing faces 28, 30, disposed at a flute angle g to each other. The flute leading and trailing faces 28, 30 meet at a flute apex 32 adjacent the axis of rotation A. The gun-drill 20 further comprises a fluid conduit 34 extending axially therethrough, comprising a conduit inner wall 36 and a fluid discharge outlet 38 at a cutting-head forward end 22F. When the cutting-head 22 is mounted in an operational, secured position in the shank 24, cutting-head and shank peripheral surfaces 40, 42, cutting-head and shank leading and trailing faces 44, 48, 46, 50, and cutting-head and shank conduit inner walls 52, 54, mate and are co-aligned.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 2 to 5. The cutting-head 22 comprises a cutting portion 56 adjacent the cutting-head forward end 22F and a cutting-head coupling portion 58 adjacent a cutting-head rear end 22R thereof. The cutting portion 56 may comprise cutting geometries of any appropriate design. The cutting-head coupling portion 58 has a rearwardly facing cutting-head intermediate surface 60 which extends circumferentially from the cutting-head leading face 44 to the cutting-head trailing face 46 and radially inwardly from the cutting-head peripheral surface 40 to a cutting-head coupling wall 62. The cutting-head coupling wall 62<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-10-<br>
extends continuously circumferentially from the cutting-head leading face 44 to the cutting-head trailing face 46 and rearwardly away from the cutting-head intermediate surface 60 towards a rearwardly facing cutting-head support surface 64. The cutting-head conduit inner wall 52 meets the cutting-head support surface 64 at a cutting-head conduit aperture 52A.<br>
The cutting-head coupling wall 62 comprises a rearwardly disposed cutting-head cylindrical surface 66 adjacent the cutting-head support surface 64, and a forwardly disposed generally frustoconical cutting-head fixation surface 68 extending axially forwardly while tapering radially inwardly from the cutting-head cylindrical surface 66 towards the cutting-head intermediate surface 60. As best shown in Fig. 4, the cutting-head coupling wall 62 extends continuously circumferentially along a cutting-head peripheral coupling angle jc which is greater than 180Â°. Generally, the cutting-head peripheral coupling angle jc is between 210Â° and 270Â°, and more commonly between 220Â° and 260Â°. In accordance with a specific embodiment, the cutting-head peripheral coupling angle jc is approximately 235Â°.<br>
The cutting-head coupling portion 58 further comprises a cutting-head stop member 70 in a form of a recess in a rear portion of the cutting-head peripheral surface 40. The cutting-head stop member 70 is bounded by three surfaces: a generally radially outwardly facing cutting-head cylindrical wall 72, a generally axially rearwardly facing cutting-head top face 74, and a flat cutting-head stop wall 76 which faces generally tangentially away from the direction of rotation R while extending generally axially forwardly from the cutting-head intermediate surface 60 to the cutting-head top face 74 and generally radially outwardly from the cutting-head cylindrical wall 72 to the cutting-head peripheral surface 40. The cutting-head stop member 70 opens tangentially to the cutting-head trailing face 46, axially<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-11-<br>
rearwardly to the cutting-head intermediate surface 60, and radially outwardly to the cutting-head peripheral surface 40.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 2 and 6 to 8. A shank coupling portion 78 is located at the shank forward end 24F and comprises a shank coupling wall 80 which extends continuously circumferentially from a shank leading face 48 to a shank trailing face 50 of the flute 26 and rearwardly towards a forwardly facing shank support surface 82. The shank conduit inner wall 54 meets the shank support surface 82 at a shank conduit aperture 54A.<br>
The shank coupling wall 80 comprises a rearwardly disposed shank cylindrical surface 84 extending in a direction away from the shank support surface 82, and a forwardly disposed generally frustoconical shank fixation surface 86 extending axially forwardly while tapering radially inwardly from the shank cylindrical surface 84 towards a forwardly facing shank intermediate surface 88. A shank stop member 90 extends away from the shank intermediate surface 88, and comprises a generally radially inwardly facing shank cylindrical wall 92 which extends from the shank fixation surface 86 to a forwardly facing shank top face 94. A flat shank stop wall 96 facing generally tangentially in the direction of rotation R extends generally axially forwardly from the shank intermediate surface 86 to the shank top face 94 and generally radially outwardly from the shank cylindrical wall 92 to the shank peripheral surface 42. The shank intermediate surface 88 extends radially outwardly away from the shank fixation surface 86 to the shank peripheral surface 42 and continuously angularly from the shank leading face 48 of the flute 26 to the shank stop wall 96, while the shank stop member 90 extends angularly from the shank stop wall 96 to the shank trailing face 48 of the flute 26.<br>
As is better shown in Fig. 7, both the shank peripheral surface 42 and the shank coupling wall 80 extend continuously angularly over a shank peripheral angle js which is substantially equal to the cutting-head peripheral coupling angle jC.<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-12-<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 9 to 11. Securing the cutting-head 22 to the shank 24 is accomplished by positioning the cutting-head 22 with the cutting-head leading face 44 facing the shank trailing face 50 and the cutting-head coupling portion 58 adjacent the shank coupling portion 78, and sliding the cutting-head coupling portion 58 into the shank coupling portion 78 until the cutting-head fixation surface 68 abuts the shank fixation surface 86, to a released position of the cutting-head 22. Rotation of the cutting-head 22 relative to the shank 24 against the direction of rotation R of the gun-drill 20 positions the cutting-head 22 in the secured position shown in Figs. 1 and 12, with the shank coupling portion 78 fully enveloping the cutting-head coupling portion 58. To remove the cutting-head 22 from the shank 24, the cutting-head 22 is rotated relative to the shank 24 in the direction of rotation R to the released position. From the released position, the cutting-head 22 can be removed from the shank 24, and a new cutting-head 22 can then secured to the shank 24.<br>
As the cutting-head 22 is rotated in the shank 24 from the released position to the secured position, the shank fixation surface 86 urges the cutting-head fixation surface 68 axially rearwardly, so that the cutting-head support surface 64 abuts the shank support surface 82, to positively and accurately position the cutting-head 22 in the shank 24. In the secured position, the shank conduit aperture 54A and the cutting-head conduit aperture 52A overlap, so that the cutting-head and shank conduit inner walls 52, 54 mate and co-align, thereby facilitating coolant flow through the shank 24 and the cutting-head 22 to the fluid discharge outlet 38. As shown in Fig. 13, the cutting-head fixation surface 68 and the shank fixation surface 86 interlock co-axially, to provide self-clamping and self-centering of the cutting-head 22 in the shank 24. Because both the cutting-head coupling portion 58 and the shank coupling portion 78 extend continuously circumferentially through the peripheral angles jc, jS, respectively, which are greater than 180Â°, the shank fixation surface 86 urges the coupling-head 22 to axially align with the shank 24.<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-13-<br>
Positive rotational location and alignment of the cutting-head 22 and the shank 24 are achieved by the cutting-head stop wall 76 abutting the shank stop wall 96, facilitating torque transmission from the shank 24 to the cutting-head 22. In the secured position, a first gap 98 extends circumferentially between the cutting-head cylindrical surface 66 and the shank cylindrical surface 84, a second gap 100 exists between the cutting-head intermediate surface 60 and the shank intermediate surface 88, a third gap 102 exists between the cutting-head cylindrical wall 72 and the shank cylindrical wall 92, and a fourth gap 104 exists between the cutting-head top face 74 and the shank top face 94.<br>
Attention is now directed to Fig. 14 showing a gun-drill 220 in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. Since the gun-drill 220 in accordance with the second embodiment has many features which are similar to those of the gun-drill 20 in accordance with the first embodiment, the similar features of the gun-drill 220 in accordance with the second embodiment will be referred to herein below by reference numerals which are shifted by 200 from those of the gun-drill 20 in accordance with the first embodiment.<br>
The gun-drill 220 in accordance with the second embodiment has an axis of rotation A and a direction of rotation R defined much in the same manner as the axis of rotation A and a direction of rotation R of the gun-drill 20 in accordance with one embodiment. The gun-drill 220 has a cutting-head 222 detachably secured to a shank 224 at a shank forward end 224F. Both the shank 224 and the cutting-head 222 have a a single, straight flute 226 extending axially along the shank 224 and the cutting-head 222. The flute has leading and trailing faces 228, 230 meeting at a flute apex 232 adjacent the axis of rotation A. A fluid conduit 234 having a conduit inner wall 236 and a fluid discharge outlet 238 formed at a cutting-head forward end 222p extends axially through the gun-drill 220. When the cutting-head 222 is mounted in an operational, secured position in the shank 224, cutting-head<br><br>

and shank peripheral surfaces 240, 242, cutting-head and shank leading and trailing faces 244, 248, 246, 250, and cutting-head and shank conduit inner walls 252, 254, mate and are co-aligned.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 15 to 17. The cutting-head 222 comprises a cutting portion 256 adjacent the cutting-head forward end 222F and a cutting-head coupling portion 258 adjacent a cutting-head rear end 222R thereof. A rearwardly facing cutting-head support surface 264 extends circumferentially from the cutting-head leading face 244 to the cutting-head trailing face 246 and radially inwardly from the cutting-head peripheral surface 240 to a cutting-head coupling wall 262. The cutting-head conduit inner wall 252 meets the cutting-head support surface 264 at a cutting-head conduit aperture 252A.<br>
The cutting-head coupling wall 262 extends continuously circumferentially from the cutting-head leading face 244 to the cutting-head trailing face 246 and rearwardly away from the cutting-head support surface 264 towards a rearwardly facing cutting-head rear surface 306. The cutting-head coupling wall 262 comprises a rearwardly disposed cutting-head cylindrical surface 266 adjacent the cutting-head rear surface 306 and a forwardly disposed generally frustoconical cutting-head fixation surface 268 extending axially forwardly while tapering inwardly from the cutting-head cylindrical surface 266 towards the cutting-head support surface 264.<br>
The cutting-head coupling portion 258 further comprises a cutting-head stop member 270 in a form of a recess in a rear portion of the cutting-head peripheral surface 40. The cutting-head stop member 270 is bounded by three surfaces: a generally radially outwardly facing cutting-head cylindrical wall 272, a generally axially rearwardly facing cutting-head top face 274, and a flat cutting-head stop wall 276 facing generally tangentially away from the direction of rotation R and extending generally axially forwardly from the cutting-head support surface 264<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-15-<br>
to the cutting-head top face 274 and generally radially outwardly from the cutting-head cylindrical wall 272 to the cutting-head peripheral surface 240. The cutting-head stop member 270 opens tangentially to the cutting-head trailing face 246, axially rearwardly to the cutting-head support surface 264 and radially outwardly to the cutting-head peripheral surface 240.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 18 to 20. A shank coupling portion 278 is formed at the shank forward end 224p and has a shank coupling wall 280 which extends continuously circumferentially from a shank leading face 248 to a shank trailing face 250 of the flute 226 and rearwardly from a forwardly facing shank support surface 282 towards a forwardly facing shank rear surface 308. The shank conduit inner wall 254 meets the shank support surface 282 at a shank conduit aperture 254A.<br>
The shank coupling wall 280 has a shank cylindrical surface 284 extending in a direction away from the shank rear surface 308, and a shank fixation surface 286 extending from the shank cylindrical surface 284 forwardly towards the shank support surface 282. A shank stop member 290 extends away from the shank support surface 282 and has a generally radially inwardly facing shank cylindrical wall 292 which extends from the shank fixation surface 286 to a forwardly facing shank top face 294. A flat shank stop wall 296 faces generally tangentially in the direction of rotation R extends generally axially forwardly from the shank support surface 282 to the shank top face 294 and generally radially outwardly from the shank cylindrical wall 292 to the shank peripheral surface 242.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 21 and 22. As the cutting-head 222 is rotated in the shank 224 from the released position to the secured position, the shank fixation surface 286 urges the cutting-head fixation surface 268 axially rearwardly, so that the cutting-head support surface 264 abuts the shank support surface 282, to positively and accurately position the cutting-head 222 in the shank 224. The shank<br><br>
WO 2006/021947	PCT/IL2005/000799<br>
-16-<br>
conduit aperture 254A and the cutting-head conduit aperture 252A overlap, so that the cutting-head and shank conduit inner walls 252, 254 mate and co-align, thereby facilitating coolant flow through the shank 224 and the cutting-head 222 to the fluid discharge outlet 238. In the secured position, a first gap 298 extends circumferentially between the cutting-head cylindrical surface 266 and the shank cylindrical surface 284, a rear gap 310 exists between the cutting-head rear surface 306 and the shank rear surface 308, a third gap 302 exists between the cutting-head cylindrical wall 272 and the shank cylindrical wall 292, and a fourth gap 304 exists between the cutting-head top face 274 and the shank top face 294.<br>
