CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application incorporates by reference the content of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/490,818, Express Mail Number, EV 331001684 US, filed July 28,2003, to Erol Bozak et al., entitled GRID COMPUTING MANAGEMENT.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to data processing by digital computer, and more particularly to a grid application start protocol.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In today's data centers, the clusters of servers in a client-server network that run business applications often do a poor job of managing unpredictable workloads. One server may sit idle, while another is constrained. This leads to a "Catch-22" where companies, needing to avoid network bottlenecks and safeguard connectivity with customers, business partners and employees, often plan for the highest spikes in workload demand, then watch as those surplus servers operate well under capacity most of the time.<br>
In grid computing, all of the disparate computers and systems in an organization or among organizations become one large, integrated computing system. That single integrated system can then handle problems and processes too large and intensive for any single computer to easily handle in an efficient manner.<br>
More specifically, grid computing is a form of distributed system wherein computing resources are shared across networks. Grid computing enables the selection, aggregation, and sharing of information resources resident in multiple administrative domains and across geographic areas. These information resources are shared, for example, based upon their availability, capability, and cost, as well as a user's quality of service (QoS) requirements. Grid computing can mean reduced cost of ownership, aggregated and improved efficiency of computing, data, and storage resources, and enablement of virtual organizations for applications and data sharing.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
In one aspect, the invention features a method including in a network, responding to a request for a computational resource available for computing a task by sending a list of available computational resources, receiving a selection of a computational resource for reservation. The method includes if the selection of the computational resource is available for computing the task, reserving the selection and sending a reservation number for the selection, and sending the request to a different portion of the network if computational resources are unavailable for computing the task.<br>
Embodiments may include one or more of the following. The list of available computational resources includes network addresses of the available computational resources. Reserving the selection further comprises assigning the reservation number. Reserving further includes waiting a predetermined time period for the computational resource to begin computing the task, and if the predetermined time period is expired and the computational resource has not begun computing the task, then freeing the computational resource for subsequent reservation for computing a second task.<br>
In some cases, responding to the request further includes comparing requirements for computing the task with specifications of the available computational resources. In these cases, the method may further include generating a list of computational resources by querying a portion of the network<br>
In another aspect, the invention features a method that includes in a network, sending, by a first service, a request for a list of one or more computational resources that are available for computing a task. The method further includes responding, by a second service, to the request by collecting information on computational resources, sending a list of available computational resources, receiving a selected computational resource for reservation, reserving the selected computational resource and sending reservation number of the selected computational resource if the selected computational resource is available for computing the task, and sending the request to a second service if the first service has no information on available computational resources.<br>
Embodiments may include one or more of the following. Sending the list of available computational resources includes sending network addresses of the available computational resources. Reserving the selected computational resource further includes assigning a reservation number. Reserving further includes waiting a predetermined time period for a request for the selected computational resource to begin computing the task, and releasing the selected computational resource for subsequent reservation for computing a second task if the predetermined time period is over and the request for the reserved computational resource has not been received. The second service has a stored relation to the first service.<br>
In some cases, responding to the request further includes comparing requirements for computing the task with specifications of available computational resources that are described by information accessible to the first service. In these cases, the first service may execute instructions on a first computer system and the computational resources managed by the first service may include a first set of computational resources located on the first computer system. Furthermore, a third service may have a stored relation with the first service, the third service executes instructions on a second computer system, and the computational resources mat are described by information accessible to the first service further comprise a second set of computational resources that are described by information accessible to the third service.<br>
In another aspect, the invention features a network that includes a first computer system having a first set of one or more computational resources and configured to execute instructions of a first service, and a second computer system configured to execute instructions of a second service. The first service is configured to respond to a request for a list of computational resources for computing a task by collecting information on at least the first set of one or more computational resources, send a list comprising a subset of the first set of the one or more computational resources, receive a selection of a computational resource for reservation, reserve the selection and send an address of the selection if the selection of the computational resource is available for computing the task, and send the request to the second service if computational resources are unavailable for computing the task.<br>
Embodiments may include one or more of the following. The network further includes a third computer system having a second set of one or more computational resources and configured to execute instructions of a third service, the third service having an stored relation to the first service, wherein the first service is further configured to collect information on the second set of one or more computational resources and the list further comprises a subset of the second set of the one or more computational resources. Reserving the selection further comprises assigning a reservation number. The first service is further configured to wait a predetermined time period for the reserved computational resource to begin computing the task, and if the predetermined time period is over and the reserved computational resource has not begun computing the task, then free the reserved computational resource for subsequent reservation for computing a second task. To respond to the request further includes comparing requirements for computing the task with specifications of available computational resources from the first and second sets of computational resources. The second service has a stored relation to the first service.<br>
These and other embodiments may have one or more of the following advantages. Using the grid application start protocol, applications can get the necessary resources allocated in a grid landscape before actually trying to run on a grid node. Furthermore, similar applications trying to start at the same time at the same grid node do not interfere with each other.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, services in a grid computing environment 100 manage computational resources for applications. The grid computing environment 100 is a set of distributed computing resources that can individually be assigned to perform computing or data retrieval tasks for the applications. The computational resources include computer devices 12, 14,16,18,20, and 22. The computer devices communicate using a network 8. The applications have scalable computational requirements. For example, an example application that uses computer devices 12,14,16,18,20, and 22 in the grid computing environment 100 is an internet pricing configurator. The computer device 12 provides network access to pricing information to users via web browsers on computer devices that are connected to the internet The web browsers can be any application able to display content and/or execute applications such as web pages, media files, and programs, such as Netscape Navigator®, Microsoft Internet Explorer®, and similar applications.<br>
In this example, a web server on computer device 12 provides pricing information to the users. Calculation parameters for each price to be calculated are passed by an IPC dispatcher 116 to IPC servers 120,122,124, and 126 mat execute on computer devices 12,14,16, and 18, respectively. Due to the flexibility of the web server and applications on the internet, the number of users can vary. This generates dynamic computational requirements for the internet pricing configurator. An IPC manager 118 communicates with services in the grid computing environment 100 so that the services can allocate and deallocate computational resources (e.g., processors in computer devices 12,14,16,18,20,22) based on the dynamic computational requirements of the internet pricing configurator. Allocating and deallocating computational<br>
resources in this manner allows computer devices 12,14,16,18,20, or 22 to be designated as general-purpose computational resources and not solely dedicated to handling peak demands of the internet pricing configurator application. The IPC manager 118 coordinates with the PC dispatcher 116 so that the IPC dispatcher 116 has access to resources in network 8.<br>
This capability to allocate and deallocate the resources in the grid computing environment 100 enables the IPC manager 118 to locate and use available computational resources on an "as needed" basis. Once resources are located, the IPC manager 118 can use services in the grid computing environment 100 to install the IPC servers 120,122,124, and 126 as applications on computer devices in the grid computing environment 100. The IPC dispatcher 116 uses Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) interfaces defined in the Open Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) Version 1.0 by Tuecke et al to manage and exchange the information flow between the IPC dispatcher 116 and IPC servers 120,122,124, and 126. For example, the OGSI WSDL interfaces can be used to pass computation parameters for pricing calculations from the IPC dispatcher 116 and the IPC servers 120,122,124, and 126. The OGSI WSDL interfaces can also be used to pass completed results from the IPC servers 120,122,124, and 126 back to IPC dispatcher 116. The OGSI Version 1.0 is incorporated herein by reference. The OGSI WSDL interfaces enable the controlled, fault-resilient, and secure management of the grid computing environment 100 and applications such as the internet pricing configurator.<br>
While the IPC dispatcher 116 uses IPC servers 120,122,124, and 126 to perform calculations for users, services in the grid computing environment 100 monitor resource utilization on computer devices in the grid computing environment 100 running the PC servers 120,122,124, and 126. The services also send this utilization information to the PC manager 118. Based on a comparison between utilization requirements and current resource loading, the' PC manager 118 can dynamically inform services in the grid computing environment 100 to allocate more resources for PC servers 120,122,124, and 126 or deallocate resources to keep utilization of resources in the grid computing environment 100 at a desired level.<br>
Grid managers 152,154,156,160,162, and 164 are resident in computer devices 12,14, 16,18,20, and 22, respectively. Within the grid computing environment 100, pairs of grid managers can have directional relations that classify one grid manager as superior to another grid manager. A grid manager can have more than one superior relations with other grid managers. For example, grid manager 152 has a superior relation with grid managers 154 and 156. A grid<br>
manager can also have more than one inferior relations with other grid managers. Through these hierarchical relations, IPC manager 118 does not need access to a list of all computer devices in network 8 to use the computational resources in the grid computing environment 100. IPC manager 118 is only required to have access to a network address of one computer device running a grid manager (e.g., computer device 12 running grid manager 152) and this grid manager uses its relations with other grid managers running on other computer devices to provide IPC dispatcher 116 with indirect access to other computer devices in the grid computing environment 100.<br>
A grid manager (e.g., 152,154,156,160,162, and 164) maintains a first list of all superior relations with other grid managers and a second list of all inferior relations with other grid managers. Each grid manager maintains an "always open" communications channel to all the grid managers in these lists over network 8 using, for example, the aforementioned OGSI WSDL interfaces on transmission control protocol (TCP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), and simple object access protocol (SOAP). These lists and corresponding communication channels can be modified, allowing a dynamic reconfiguration of the grid hierarchy during runtime. This also allows a failing grid manager to be dynamically replaced in the hierarchy. For example, referring to FIG. 1, if grid manager 154 Ms, then grid manager 152 loses its connection to grid managers 160 and 162. In this case, relations between grid managers can be modified so that grid manager 152 has new superior relations to grid managers 160 and 162. Likewise, grid managers 160 and 162 have new inferior relations to grid manager 152.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, an application start process 200 is designed so applications (e.g., internet pricing configurator) get necessary resources allocated in the network 8 before executing on a computer device (e.g., 12,14,16,18,20, or 22). Process 200 also guarantees if similar applications are trying to start at the same time on the same resource on a computer device that the two or more applications do not collide or interfere with each other. For example, the IPC manager 118 can require that an IPC server (e.g., 120) be the only application executing on a processor in computer device 14 for quality of service (QoS). In this case, another application would interfere if the other application simultaneously attempted to execute on the processor in computer device 14.<br>
Process 200 includes IPC manager 118 (or some other application) sending (202) requirements for computational resources to query a grid manager (e.g., 154) to determine if<br><br>
there are resources matching these requirements available in the grid computing environment 100. These requirements specify information pertaining to resources in a computer device such as required number of processors, required percentage of utilization for those processors, main memory, and network speed- The query can also include information to which hierarchy level (in the grid computing environment 100) the query should be propagated. Process 200 includes grid manager 154 receiving (204) the requirements.<br>
To respond to the query for available resources from IPC manager 118, process 200 includes grid manager 154 matching (206) the requirements against resources known to grid manager 154. These resources include resources (e.g., processor 40) in computer device 14 that are directly managed by grid manager 154. Resources directly managed by grid manager 154 that are currently available and meet the requirements are added to a resource-query list maintained by grid manager 154.<br>
Grid manager 154 also sends the query to grid managers 160 and 162 having inferior relations with grid manager 154. Process 200 includes grid managers 160 and 162 responding (208) to the query by sending to grid manager 154 lists of resources (e.g., processors on computer devices 18,20) that meet the requested requirements and are available and known to grid managers 160 and 162, respectively. These resource-query lists of resources that are known to grid managers 160 and 162 can also include resources managed by grid managers (not shown) with inferior relations to grid managers 160 and 162. Grid manager 154 adds these resource-query lists of available resources from grid managers 160 and 162 to its resource-query list of available resources meeting the requested requirements. If process 200 determines (210) that there is at least one resource (e.g., processor 40) in this resource-query list, then grid manager 154 sends (214) this resource-query list to IPC manager 118. Otherwise, if process 200 determines (212) that grid manager 154 has a relation with a superior grid manager (e.g., grid manager 152), grid manager 154 sends (202) the query for available resources to grid manager 152. In response to this query, grid manager 152 does not send a redundant query back to grid manager 154 having an inferior relation with grid manager 152.<br>
Process 200 includes grid manager 154 sending (214) the list of available resources along with addresses of their corresponding grid managers in the network 8 that match the requirements. The IPC manager 118 selects a resource (e.g., on computer device 16) from the list and requests (216) a reservation of the resource on computer device 16 to the grid manager<br>
154 managing the resource on computer device 16. If the resource in computer device 16 is still available for reservation (218) and the reservation succeeds, grid manager 154 sends (220) a reservation number to the IPC manager 118. This reservation means that the IPC manager 118 is guaranteed and allocated the requested resource on the computer device 16 in the grid computing environment 100. The grid manager 154 handles queries for available resources from applications such as IPC manager 118 using independent processing threads of execution. Thus, the grid manager 154 uses a semaphore to ensure that the same resource (e.g., processor 40) is not assigned multiple reservation numbers for different applications simultaneously requesting the same resource.<br>
If the grid manager determines that the requested resource in computer device 16 is not available for reservation and the reservation fails, the IPC manager 118 selects the next available resource in the list and requests (216) the reservation of this next available resource. If the IPC manager 118 receives a registration number and a timeout measured from the sending of the registration number does not expire (222), the IPC manager 118 starts (224) the IPC server 122 on the processor 40 resource in computer device 16. Starting the IPC server 122 is initiated by passing the reservation number and an application file to the grid manager 156 and then grid manager 156 reads the application file to install and execute the IPC server 122 on computer device 16.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, process 250 installs an application (e.g., IPC server 122) on a computer device (e.g., 14) in the grid computing environment 100 to set up an available resource for the application, using the available resource, and removing or deinstalling the application to free up the resource for use by subsequent applications when the resource is no longer needed. Process 250 includes IPC manager 118 transferring (252) an application file containing code for IPC server 122 in addition to instructions on how to install, customize, track and remove the application from computer device 14 so that the grid manager 154 can return computer device 14 to an original state after executing the application.<br>
IPC manager 118 transfers the application file using a file transfer protocol (FTP), hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP), or a file copy from a network attached storage (NAS) for example, to computer device 14 as a single file, such as a compressed zip file. Within this zip file there is information about installing and customizing the application IPC server 122. This information is represented by a small executable program or extended markup language (XML)<br>
document that is extracted and interpreted (254) by an installation and customizing engine (not shown) in grid manager 154. Process 250 includes grid manager 154 installing (256) and running (258) the application. During installation (256), customization and execution (258) of the application, all changes to the computer device 14 are logged so that when the application is terminated (260) or deinstalled by grid manager 154 upon request by IPC manager 118, grid manager 154 removes the application from the computer device 14 and also removes (262) any other changes to computer device 14 that were done when installing and running the application. Thus, the computer device 14 reverts to its original state prior to execution of the application and all of the resources of computer device 14 are again available for use by a subsequent application. This allows the resources to become available after running the application without rebooting computer device 14. These changes include space in memory (e.g., 32) allocated to store and run application code in addition to other changes such as allocation of communication ports.<br>
In some examples, multiple applications can simultaneously run on resources in a single computer device (e.g., 14). Applications for the grid computing environment 100 are classified in part based on their resource requirements. Some changes to a computer device to run an application are only required for the first execution of an application of its class and subsequent executions do not require these changes. In these examples, grid manager 154 only does the changes for the first execution. Furthermore, when deinstalling the applications, grid manager 154 only removes the changes for the last application that was executed and terminated.<br>
After installing applications on computer devices in the grid computing environment 100, grid managers are configured to start or stop the processes of these applications upon request. In the example of the internet pricing configurator (IPC) application, grid manager 154 is configured to start or stop IPC server 122 on computer device 14 after installing IPC server 122 on computer device 14. The IPC manager 118 requests grid managers to start or stop PC servers in the grid computing environment 100 based on current utilization of resources in the grid computing environment 100. After stopping IPC server 122 on computer device 14, IPC manager 118 waits aprespecified amount of time and then requests grid manager 154 to deinstall IPC server 122 if current resource utilization does not indicate a need to start IPC server 122 again. Furthermore, as mentioned previously, grid managers monitor resource utilization on<br>
computer devices such as computer device 14 running applications (e.g. IPC servers 120,122, 124, and 126) and send this utilization information to IPC manager 118.<br>
In many examples, control of application processes on resources in a computer device is specific to the operating system (OS). The grid computing environment 100 is configured to handle different operating systems on computer devices. Furthermore, grid computing environment 100 is designed to handle different applications (e.g., internet pricing configurator) that do not have to be redesigned to execute on the grid computing environment 100. A grid manager controls an application process in a general manner that decreases interdependence between development of grid manager code and application code. An interface is provided to application code to enable grid managers to discover, control (e.g., start, stop, halt, resume) and inspect or monitor a state of application processes. The interface is provided for operating system processes that are exposed by the operating system or hosting environment and includes three aspects. One aspect of the interface is process data, such as process identification, states, degree of resource consumption (such as Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, socket bindings, or other resources that an application can use), and application specific data defined by a process data scheme.<br>
A second aspect of the interface is managing operations, such as start, stop, wait, resume, change priority, and other operations defined by supported managing operations.<br>
A third aspect of the interface is control bindings and definitions, such as process data scheme, supported managing operations, and communication bindings. Since not all applications running in the grid computing environment 100 have access to the same information and capabilities in these three aspects, the applications provide to grid managers a list of queries and commands that each application supports.<br>
The interface provided to application code is an Application Program Interface (API). The API is a set of methods (embedded in software code) prescribed by the grid manager software by which a programmer writing an application program (e.g., internet pricing configurator) can handle requests from the grid manager.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, IPC server 122 includes an API 302 and a document 304. Since the API 302 is adapted to different types of applications, the document 304 describes how grid manager 154 communicates with the IPC server 122 and what requests through the API 302 are supported by the IPC server 122. Grid manager 154 reads document 304 before starting up IPC<br>
server 122. In some examples, document 304 is written in XML and includes a Document Type Description (DTD) 306. A DTD is a specific definition that follows the rules of the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML). A DTD is a specification that accompanies a document and identifies what the markups are mat separate paragraphs, identify topic headings, and how each markup is to be processed. By including the DTD 306 with document 304, grid manager 154 having a DTD "reader" (or "SGML compiler") is able to process the document 304 and can correctly interpret many different kinds of documents 304 that use a range of different markup codes and related meanings.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4A, grid manager 154 uses process 350 to install applications such as IPC server 122. Grid manager 154 reads (352) DTD 306 in document 304 to identify markups in document 304. Grid manager 154 reads (354) document 304 using markups to identify communication parameters for communicating with IPC server 122. Grid manager 154 sets up (356) communications with IPC server 122 based on the specifications of the communication parameters. Grid manager 154 communicates (358) with IPC server 122 using the communication parameters to send requests such as "Start", "Stop", and "Are you idle?".<br>
Before any applications (e.g., internet pricing configurator) can be executed on network 8, grid managers 152,154,156,160,162, and 164 are asynchronously started up on computer devices 12,14,16,18,20, and 22, and relations to other grid managers are established. As shown in FIG. 5, process 400 initializes relations among grid managers. For each grid manager (e.g., grid manager 154), the grid manager 154 starts up on computer device 14 by reading (402) a properties file. The properties file contains a list of addresses of computer devices with grid managers having superior relations to grid manager 154. This list was described earlier as a first list of all superior relations with other grid managers. If (404) a superior grid manager (e.g., grid manager 152) is specified in this list of addresses, grid manager 154 requests (406) to open a communication channel to the superior grid manager (e.g., 152). If grid manager 152 is already started, then grid manager 152 responds by accepting the request of the opening of the communication channel from grid manager 152. Process 400 includes grid manager 154 detecting (408) any requests for communication channels from grid managers (e.g., grid managers 160,162) identified as having inferior relations with grid manager 154. If process 400 determines (410) that there are some requests, grid manager 154 allows communication channels from the inferior grid managers (e.g., 160,162). Process 400 includes grid manager 154<br>
checking (414) if there are any pending requests for communication to grid managers having superior relations. If there are any pending requests, grid manager 154 requests (406) communication channels to grid managers. These communication channels are used for resource queries between grid managers (as described previously) and "heart beat" messages between grid managers to ensure that each grid manager in the grid computing environment 100 is functioning.<br>
Once grid managers 152,154,156,160,162, and 164 are running with established relations, the grid managers are used for the proper operation of the grid computing environment 100. Often during the lifecycle of the grid computing environment 100 the functionality of the grid managers are enhanced. It is often not possible or convenient to shut down the grid computing environment 100 and start the grid computing environment 100 up with the enhancements. Grid managers 152,154,156,160,162, and 164 are configured so that there is only a minimal impact on users of the grid computing environment 100 when a change happens. To enable this transparency, an API is provided for user interfaces to enable an administrator of grid computing environment 100 to access each of the grid managers 152,154,156,160,162, and 164 individually or all together. The API is static in that it includes only one method, i.e., a string that contains a command typed by the administrator. The API is dynamic because the string can contain many different commands.<br>
In some cases, the grid managers are developed using the Java programming language. In these cases, new commands issued to the grid managers can be supported by loading new or revised Java classes dynamically via classloaders. This dynamic access to code can be done without shutting down grid managers in the grid computing environment 100. Using Java classloaders, each time an instance of a class for a grid manager is generated, the definition and behavior of the class can be updated to provide new functionality to the grid computing environment 100.<br>
Another way to modify the functionality of the grid computing environment 100 dynamically without shutting down the grid computing environment 100 is to change the hierarchical relations between grid managers, remove grid managers, or add new grid managers. The API provided for administration of the grid computing environment 100 is also configured to send strings to individual grid managers with commands to delete existing relations or add new relations.<br>
For administrators of grid computing environment 100, it is useful to visualize the applications and a grid manager on one computer device in the grid computing environment 100 as well as other computer devices running part of the grid management hierarchy in the form of grid managers with one or more levels of inferior relations to the grid manager. The view of these computer devices is referred to as a grid landscape. As shown in FIG. 6, a grid graphical user interface (GUI) 500 for visualization of a grid landscape, such as the grid computing environment 100, includes GUI-elements visualizing an organization of services running on computer devices. The GUI 500 provides a grid-like structure with columns and rows. Rows represent services, which in turn are structured hierarchically with respect to the application where a service belongs to, the type of the service, and the specific service instances. Each service instance row is associated with a place in the grid computing environment 100 representing where it is instantiated. In this context, columns represent the computer devices in the grid landscape. Specifically, GUI 500 has three columns representing three computer devices 12,14, and 16. GUI 500 shows that grid manager 152 runs on computer device 12 with inferior grid managers 154 and 156 running on computer devices 14 and 16, respectively. GUI 500 also shows internet pricing configurator services running on computer device 12. These internet pricing configurator services include IPC dispatcher 116, IPC server 120, and IPC manager 118.<br>
The GUI 500 is dynamically refreshed with feedback from the grid managers and internet pricing configurator (or other application) services so that new services appear in GUI 500 to an administrator. Similarly, services that are shut down are removed in GUI 500.<br>
As shown in FIG. 7, a grid browser component 600 is a composite graphical user interface (GUI) for browsing grid managers on computer devices in the grid computing environment 100. The component 600 displays a graph with curved edges and vertices. Vertices represent computer devices in the grid computing environment 100 and curved edges represent the directional association of grid managers on two computer devices (vertices) in the grid computing environment 100. This association is hierarchical (i.e., superior/inferior). Each vertex displays the network address of a computer device as well as applications currently running on the computer device. For example, component 600 shows computer devices 12,14, 16,18,20, and 22 with IPC servers 118,120,122, and 124. In other examples (not shown), the<br>
grid browser component 600 shows non-hierarchical, peer to peer associations of grid managers with non-directional edges representing the associations.<br>
The grid browser component 600 is context sensitive. Depending on the relationship among the grid managers on the computer devices (e.g., superior/inferior), computer devices are traversed in respect to a user's browsing history.<br>
By clicking on a vertex representing a computer device in GUI 600 (e.g., computer device 14), a user can automatically view a grid manager and applications running on the computer device and grid managers having inferior relations to the grid manager using GUI 500. The user can pick a computer device and see relations between its grid manager and other grid managers. This connection between GUIs 500 and 600 is done using software that generates GUIs 500 and 600.<br>
