				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of Levofloxacin having single individual impurity not more than 0.1% and free from particulate matter &amp; from the other enantiomer (R-form) in the form of Levofloxacin Hemihydrate. More specially, the invention provides an improved process for the preparation of high purity form of Levofloxacin hemihydrate from Levofloxacin Q acid and Levofloxacin technical. The Levofloxacin in the form of Levofloxacin Hemihydrate prepared has a single individual impurity less than 0.1% free from particulate matter and other enantiomer (R-form). Levofloxacin form prepared by the process of the present invention is useful as an antibacterial. The invention also relates to an improved process for the preparation of the above pure form of Levofloxacin starting from 2,3,4,5 -tetrafluoro benzoic acid through the intermediates Levofloxacin Q acid and Levofloxacin technical.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Levofloxacin is the S - (-) isomer of the fluoroquinoline antibacterial Ofloxacin. It has a broad spectrum of activity, which included Gram - positive bacteria. [ Davis R, Bryson HM, Drugs, 4, 677 (1994)]. Levofloxacin is given by mouth or intravenously for the treatment of susceptible infections in a usual dose of 250 or 500mg. Once or twice daily, it is also administered topically as 0.5% eye drops for the treatment of bacteria conjunctivitis [Martindale, The Complete Drug Reference, 33rd edition, pp.219 (2002) and references cited therein].<br><br>
The Levofloxacin hemihydrate is (S)-9-Fluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-10-(4-<br>
methyl-l-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-7H-pyrido[l,2,35-de]-l,4-benzoxazine	-6-<br>
carboxylic acid hemihydrate. The chemical structure of Levofloxacin hemihydrate (CAS Registry No. [138199-71-0]) is shown as formula 1.<br>
US patent No. 5, 545,737 and EP patent No. 0444678 disclose a process for the preparation of levofloxacin hemihydrate or monohydrate selectively by controlling the water content of an aqueous solvent selected from the group consisting of methanol, ethanol, propanol and acetone in which levofloxacin is dissolved during crystallization.<br>
Niddamkil Desheim, Valeric et. al disclose in WO03/045329, and in WO 03/028665, methods for the purification of Levofloxacin using polar solvent such as DMSO, methyl ethyl ketone, acetonitrile, butanol and mixtures thereof and aqueous mixture thereof and / or using an antioxidant.<br>
Levofloxacin was first disclosed in US patent 5,053,407 and in Antimicrob, Agents chemother, 29, 163 (1986) by Hayakawa I, et.al. In this process 9,10-Difluro-3 -(hydroxymethyl)-7-oxo-2,3 -dihydro-7H-pyrido [1,2,3 -de]-l ,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid ethyl ester, a racemic intermediate in the synthesis of Ofloxacin was resolved and esterified with 3,5-dinitro benzoyl chloride, separated by HPLC column SUMIPAXOA-4200, using hexane, 1,2 dichloro ethane, ethanol as carrier solvent. The (-) optical isomer is partially hydrolyzed with ethanolic aqueous sodium bicarbonate to afford the (-) alcohol, which is treated with triphenyl phosphite methiodide in DMF giving the corresponding (-)-iodomethyl derivative. The reduction and simultaneous hydrolysis with tributyltin hydride in ethanol yield (-)-9,10-difluoro-3-methyl-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H-pyriodo[l,2,3-<ie l acid which></ie><br>
is finally treated with N-methyl piperazine at 120Â°C in DMSO to give (-) Ofloxacin i.e. Levofloxacin.<br>
In US patent no. 5,053,407 racemic-3-acetoxy methyl-7,8-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-4H-[1,4] benzoxazine was resolved through its dinitrobenzoyl derivatives (or condensed with a cyclic amino acid or a reactive derivative through amide linkage) followed by debenzoylation, deacylation and dehydroxylation to obtain optically active 7,8-difluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyl-4H-[l-4]-benzoxazine which on condensation with diethyl ethoxy acrylomalonate followed by cyclization, hydrolysis and condensation with N-methyl piperazine to obtain Levofloxacin.<br>
Scientists of Daiichi prepared the intermediate (-)9,10-difluoro-3-methyl-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H-pyrido[ 1,2,3-de]-l,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid by either resolution or cinral specific synthesis. While condensation with N-methyl piperazine major reports disclosed in the presence of DMSO at above 100Â°C or chilation with BF3-OEt2 in ether and then condensation with N-methyl piperazine in the presence of DMSO, triethylamine has reported.<br>
The preparation of Levofloxacin has also been reported in US patent no. 4,777,253 and J.Med.Chem. 30,2283 (1987) by Mitcher et. al. Levofloxacin synthesized from 2,3,4,5-tetrafluoro benzoic acid which is treated with thionyl chloride to produce the corresponding acid chloride. Displacement of the acid chloride with inaionic acid half ester in the presence of n-Butyl lithium yield the p-ketoester.The p-ketoester is then treated with a trialkyl orthoformate in the presence of an acid anhydride yielding Ethyl-2-(2,3,4,5,-tetrafluoro benzoyl)-3-alkoxy acylate, which on reaction with (S)-2-amino-l-propanol to obtain enamino ketoester. The enamino ketoster is then cyclized such as by treatment<br><br>
with two moles equivalents of an alkali metal hydride, alkoxide at an elevated temperature to obtain alkyl-(-)-9-10-difluoro-3-methyl-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7//-pyrido-[ 1,2,3-de]-l,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylate. The condensation reaction between N-methyl piperazine and alkyl (-)-9,10-difluoro-3-methyl-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H-pyrido[l,2,3-de] 1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylate at temperature from 20Â°C to 200Â°C and preferably from 40Â°C to 90Â°C in the presence of a suitable organic solvent such as pyridine, chloroform, dimethylsulphoxide, sulfolane, dimethyl formamide, dimethylacetamide, I-methyl-2-Pyrrolidone. It is desirable to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid-acceptor such as triethyl amine, potassium carbonate and the like a molar ratio of 1.0 to 1.2 mole of the acid-acceptor per mole of the ester. N-methyl piperazine can also be used an acid-acceptor in which two or more molar excess in used.<br>

The (-) 9,10-Difluoro-2,3-dihydro-3-methyll-7-oxo-H/-pyrido[l,2,3-de]-l,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid is prepared starting from (S) (+)-2-Amino-l-propanol in four steps by condensing with alkyl silylated piperazine in the presence of organic polar solvent such as pyridine, dimethylsulfoxide, acetonitrile, dimethylformamide, N-methyl, pyrrolidine and sulfolane.<br>
Juan C, Carretoro et. al in Heterocycles vol 51, No. 7, 1999; have also published an efficient synthesis of Ofloxacine and Levofloxacin from 3,4-difluoroaniline. Key steps in the synthetic sequence are the regioselective functionalization at either C-2 or C-3 of the N-(tert-butoxy carbonyl)-3,4,-difluroaniline and the construction of the benzoxazine skeleton by O-alkylation of the corresponding phenol with propoylene oxide, which was transformed into Ofloxacin or Levofloxacin by condensing with N-methyl piperazine.<br>
