				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to formulation components, such as organic catalyst compounds designed with time-controlled bleaching to increase color safety, compositions and laundry methods employing such organic catalyst compounds. More particularly, this invention relates to organic catalysts compounds such as quaternary imine bleach boosting compounds, quaternary oxaziridinium bleaching species, modified amines and amine oxides, imines, and/or oxaziridines, compositions and laundry methods employing such organic catalyst compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Oxygen bleaching agents have become increasingly popular in recent years in household and personal care products to facilitate stain and soil removal. Bleaches are particularly desirable for their stain-removing, dingy fabric cleanup, whitening and sanitization properties. Oxygen bleaching agents have found particular acceptance in laundry products such as detergents, in automatic dishwashing products and in hard surface cleansers. Oxygen bleaching agents, however, are somewhat limited in their effectiveness. Some frequently encountered disadvantages include their lack of fabric cdtor safety and their tendency to be extremely temperature rate dependent. Thus, the colder the solution in which they are employed, the less effective the bleaching action. Temperatures in excess of 60 °C are typically required for effectiveness of an oxygen bleaching agent in solution.<br>
To solve the aforementioned temperature rate dependency, a class of compounds known as "bleach activators" has been developed. Bleach activators, typically perhydrolyzable acyl compounds having a leaving group such as oxybenzenesulfonate, react with the active oxygen group, typically hydrogen peroxide or its anion, to form a more effective peroxyacid oxidant. It is the peroxyacid compound which then oxidizes the stained or soiled substrate material. However, bleach activators are also somewhat temperature dependent. Bleach activators are more effective at warm water temperatures of from about 40 °C to about 60 °C. In water temperatures of less than about 40 °C, the peroxyacid compound loses some of its bleaching effectiveness.<br>
Unsuccessful attempts have been made, as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,568, 5,360,569 and 5,370,826 all to Madison et al., to develop a bleach system comprising organic catalysts, more specifically, iminium-based organic catalysts, which is effective in lower<br>
temperature water conditions and is safe on colors. However, cationic, quaternary imine salts, one of the types of organic catalysts disclosed in these applications, are not completely satisfactory in laundry bleaching applications. In particular, the quaternary imine salts, when combined with peroxygen compounds, cause an unacceptable level of color damage on fabrics.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,282 and 5,817,614 both to Miracle et al. disclose another attempt at developing a bleach system comprising organic catalysts which is effective in lower temperature water conditions and is relatively safe on colors. Although the bleach system disclosed in this patent provides enhanced color-safety over the traditional organic catalyst bleach systems, consumers desire more color-safe bleach products.<br>
Additional disadvantages associated with the conventional organic catalysts, examples of which are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,568, 5,360,569 and 5,370,826 all to Madison et al., and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,576,282 and 5,817,614, both to Miracle et al., include the organic catalysts having prolonged activity. Iminiums and dihydroisoquinoliniums, and the quaternary oxaziridinium bleaching species formed from them, exemplified in the art have organic catalyst lifetimes about greater than 15 min at 20 °C, as determined according to the Test Protocol, disclosed hereinafter. Such stability can result in too much available oxygen ("AvO") consumption, leading to an altered performance profile (i.e., changing the balance between peracid bleaching and organic catalyst bleaching).<br>
In light of the foregoing, it is evident that there still exists a need for an organic catalyst bleach system that provides effective bleaching in lower temperature water conditions and provides time-controlled bleaching and superior color-safety properties compared to the bleach systems disclosed in the prior art.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention fulfills the need discussed above. The present invention provides formulation components, such as organic catalyst compounds having an effective lifetime of less than 20 minutes and greater than 15 seconds at 20 °C under the conditions outlined in Test Protocol I described hereinafter. Such organic catalyst compounds work best in lower wash temperatures less than 80 °C.<br>
In addition to the organic catalyst compounds, compositions and laundry methods employing such organic catalyst compounds are also disclosed herein. More particularly, organic catalysts compounds such as quaternary imine bleach boosting compounds, quaternary oxaziridinium bleaching species, modified amines and amine oxides, imines and oxaziridines, compositions and laundry methods employing such organic catalyst compounds are provided by the present invention.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of the benefits provided by the formulation components, specifically the organic catalyst compounds, include superior bleaching effectiveness even in lower temperature water, and improved color safety.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, a formulation component, preferably an organic catalyst compound which demonstrates effective bleaching in lower water temperature and provides a superior color-safety profile compared to the conventional organic catalyst is provided.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, a bleaching composition comprising one or more of the formulation components described above in conjunction with or without a peroxygen source is provided.<br>
In accordance with yet another aspect of the present invention, a method for laundering a fabric in need of laundering comprising contacting the fabric with a laundry solution having one or more of the bleaching compositions described herein is provided.<br>
In accordance with still yet another aspect of the present invention, a laundry additive product comprising one or more of the formulation components described herein is provided.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide: a formulation component, preferably an organic catalyst compound, which demonstrates improved performance even in lower temperature water solutions and improved color safety; a bleaching composition comprising one or more of the formulation components described herein; a method for laundering a fabric using one or more of the bleaching compositions described herein; and a laundry additive product comprising one or more of the formulation components described herein.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art from the following description and the appended claims.<br>
All percentages, ratios and proportions herein are on a weight basis unless otherwise indicated. All documents cited herein are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Concentration of Organic Catalyst Compounds - The organic catalyst compounds of the present invention may be added to a wash solution in levels of from about 0.00001% (0.0001 ppm) to about 10% (100 ppm) by weight of the composition, and preferably from about 0.0001% (0.001<br>
ppm) to about 2% (20 ppm) by weight of the composition, more preferably from about 0.005% (0.05 ppm) to about 0.5% (5 ppm), even more preferably from about 0.01% (0.1 ppm) to about 0.2% (2 ppm). Most preferably from about 0.02% (0.2 ppm) to about 0.1% (1 ppm).<br>
Preferably, the bleaching compositions of the present invention bleach<br>
composition comprise an amount of organic catalyst compound such that the resulting concentration of the bleach boosting compound in a wash solution is from about 0.001 ppm to about 5 ppm.<br>
Further, preferably the bleach compositions of the present invention comprise an amount of peroxygen compound, when present, and an amound of organic catalyst compound, such that the resulting molar ratio of said peroxygen compound to organic catalyst compound in a wash solution is preferably greater than 1:1, more preferably greater than 10:1, even more preferably greater than 50:1. The preferred molar ratio ranges of peroxygen compound to cationic organic catalyst compound range from about 30,000:1 to about 10:1, even more preferably from about 10,000:1 to about 50:1, yet even more preferably from about 5,000:1 to about 100:1, still even more preferably from about 3,500:1 to about 150:1.<br>
The conversion values (in ppm) are provided for exemplary purposes, based on an in-use product concentration of 1000 ppm. A 1000 ppm wash solution of a product containing 0.2% organic catalyst compound by weight results in a organic catalyst compound concentration of 2 ppm. Similarly, a 3500 ppm wash solution of a product containing 0.2% organic catalyst compound by weight results in a organic catalyst compound concentration of 6.5 ppm.<br>
The method for delivering organic catalyst compounds of the present invention and the method for delivering bleaching compositions (products) containing such organic catalyst compounds that are particularly useful in the methods of the present invention are the organic catalyst compounds and compositions containing same that satisfy the preferred method for bleaching a stained substrate in an aqueous medium with a peroxygen source and with an organic catalyst compound whose structures is defined herein and wherein said medium contains active oxygen from the peroxygen compound from about 0.05 to about 250 ppm per liter of medium, and said organic catalyst compound from 0.001 ppm to about 5 ppm, preferably from about 0.01 ppm to about 3 ppm, more preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 2 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.2 ppm to about 1 ppm.<br>
Such a preferred method for bleaching a stained substrate in an aqueous medium with a peroxygen source and with an organic catalyst compound is of particular value for those applications in which the color safety of the stained substrate in need of cleaning is a concern. In such applications the preferred embodiment (e.g., 0.01 ppm to about 3 ppm) is of particular importance in terms of achieving acceptable fabric color safety. For other applications in which<br>
color safety of the stained substrate in need of cleaning is of less concern, a higher in-use concentration may be preferred. DECOMPOSITION OF ORGANIC CATALYSTS<br>
The organic catalysts, specifically the bleach boosting compounds of the present invention are susceptible to decomposition by various decomposition pathways including, but not limited to, the aromatization pathway. The aromatization (decomposition) reaction of 6-membered ring boosters is well known in the art, as exemplified, without being limited by theory, in Hanquet et al., Tetrahedron 1993, 49, pp. 423-438. Other means of decomposition include, but are not limited to, attack on the bleach boosting compound and/or on the bleaching species by nucleophiles, including but not limited to attack by hydroxide anion, perhydroxide anion, carboxylate anion, percarboxylate anion and other nucleophiles present under in-wash conditions. For example, and without intending to be bound by theory, the decomposition reaction of a 6-membered ring oxaziridinium, the overall process of which can lead to reduced bleaching efficiency, is exemplified as set forth below:<br>

METHODS FOR DELAYED (CONTROLLED) ADDITION OF ORGANIC CATALYST COMPOUNDS<br>
It has surprisingly been found with organic catalyst compounds of limited lifetime, that the addition of organic catalyst compounds by a delivery means to a wash solution after a fabric has been added to a wash solution, especially a wash solution that contains a peroxygen source, provides enhanced bleaching compared to the addition of such organic catalyst compounds to the wash solution before a fabric has been added to the wash solution. It is believed, without being limited by theory, that the organic catalyst compound undergoes decomposition in the wash solution prior to the introduction of the fabric load. One method for improving the performance of organic catalyst compounds is to delay the addition of the organic catalyst compound of the present invention to the wash solution. Methods for delayed (controlled) addition of organic catalyst compounds are more fully described in copending and co-owned U.S. Provisional Patent Application entitled "Controlled Availability of Formulation Components, Compositions and Laundry Methods Employing Same" filed August 27, 1999 (P&amp;G Attorney Docket Number 7749P).<br>
Another method of improving the performance of organic catalyst compounds is to use an organic catalyst compound with increased stability to the wash conditions.   This application describes organic catalyst compounds which exhibit an organic catalyst lifetime of from about 15 seconds to about 20 minutes as determined by Test Protocols I and/or II, described hereinafter.

Hydrogen peroxide sources are described in detail in the herein incorporated Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 4th Ed (1992, John Wiley &amp; Sons), Vol. 4, pp. 271-300 "Bleaching Agents (Survey)", and include the various forms of sodium perborate and sodium percarbonate, including various coated and modified forms.<br>
The preferred source of hydrogen peroxide used herein can be any convenient source, including hydrogen peroxide itself. For example, perborate, e.g., sodium perborate (any hydrate but preferably the mono- or tetra-hydrate), sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate or equivalent percarbonate salts, sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate, urea peroxyhydrate, or sodium peroxide can be used herein. Also useful are sources of available oxygen such as persulfate bleach (e.g., OXONE, manufactured by DuPont). Sodium perborate monohydrate and sodium percarbonate are particularly preferred. Mixtures of any convenient hydrogen peroxide sources can also be used.<br>
A preferred percarbonate bleach comprises dry particles having an average particle size in the range from about 500 micrometers to about 1,000 micrometers, not more than about 10% by<br>
weight of said particles being smaller than about 200 micrometers and not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being larger than about 1,250 micrometers. Optionally, the percarbonate can be coated with a silicate, borate or water-soluble surfactants. Percarbonate is available from various commercial sources such as FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may also comprise as the bleaching agent a chlorine-type bleaching material. Such agents are well known in the art, and include for example sodium dichloroisocyanurate ("NaDCC"). However, chlorine-type bleaches are less preferred for compositions which comprise enzymes.<br>

Depending on the activator and precise application, good bleaching results can be obtained from bleaching systems having with in-use pH of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 9.0 to about 10.5. Typically, for example, activators with electron-withdrawing moieties are used for near-neutral or sub-neutral pH ranges. Alkalis and buffering agents can be used to secure such pH.<br>
Acyl lactam activators, as described in U.S. 5,698,504, U.S. 5,695,679 and U.S. 5,686,014, each of which is cited herein above, are very useful herein, especially the acyl caprolactams (see for example WO 94-28102 A) and acyl valerolactams (see U.S. 5,503,639 Willey et al., issued April 2, 1996 incorporated herein by reference).<br>

Organic peroxides are extensively illustrated in Kirk Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 17, John Wiley and Sons, 1982 at pages 27-90 and especially at pages<br>
63-72, all incorporated herein by reference. If a diacyl peroxide is used, it will preferably be one which exerts minimal adverse impact on spotting/filming.<br>
e. Metal-containing Bleach Catalysts - The bleaching compositions can also optionally include metal-containing bleach catalysts, preferably manganese and cobalt-containing bleach catalysts.<br>
One type of metal-containing bleach catalyst is a catalyst system comprising a transition metal cation of defined bleach catalytic activity, such as copper, iron, titanium, ruthenium tungsten, molybdenum, or manganese cations, an auxiliary metal cation having little or no bleach catalytic activity, such as zinc or aluminum cations, and a sequestrate having defined stability constants for the catalytic and auxiliary metal cations, particularly ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, ethylenediaminetetra (methylenephosphonic acid) and water-soluble salts thereof. Such catalysts are disclosed in U.S. 4,430,243 Bragg, issued February 2,1982.<br>
i. Manganese Metal Complexes - If desired, the compositions herein can be catalyzed by means of a manganese compound. Such compounds and levels of use are well known in the art and include, for example, the manganese-based catalysts disclosed in U.S. 5,576,282 Miracle et al., issued November 19, 1996; U.S. 5,246,621 Favre et al., issued September 21, 1993; U.S. 5,244,594 Favre et al., issued September 14, 1993; U.S. 5,194,416 Jureller et al., issued March 16, 1993; U.S. 5,114,606 van Vliet et al., issued May 19, 1992; and European Pat.

ii. Cobalt Metal Complexes - Cobalt bleach catalysts useful herein are known, and are described, for example, in U.S. 5,597,936 Perkins et al., issued January 28, 1997; U.S. 5,595,967 Miracle et al., January 21, 1997; U.S. 5,703,030 Perkins et al., issued December 30, 1997; and M. L. Tobe, "Base Hydrolysis of Transition-Metal Complexes", Adv. Inorg. Bioinorg.<br>
Mech.. (1983), 2, pages 1-94. The most preferred cobalt catalyst useful herein are cobalt pentaamine acetate salts having the formula [Co(NH3)5OAc] Tv, wherein "OAc" represents an acetate moiety and "Ty" is an anion, and especially cobalt pentaamine acetate chloride, [Co(NH3)5OAc]Cl2; as well as [Co(NH3)5OAc](OAc)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](PF6)2; [Co(NH3)5OAc](SO4); [Co(NH3)5OAc](BF4)2; and [Co(NH3)5OAc](NO3)2 (herein "PAC").<br>
These cobalt catalysts are readily prepared by known procedures, such as taught for example in U.S. 5,597,936, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,703,030, cited herein above, the Tobe article and the references cited therein, and in U.S. Patent 4,810,410, to Diakun et al, issued March 7,1989, L Chem. Ed. (1989), 66 (12), 1043-45; The Synthesis and Characterization of Inorganic Compounds, W.L. Jolly (Prentice-Hall; 1970), pp. 461-3; Inorg. Chem.. 18, 1497-1502 (1979); Inore. Chem.. 21, 2881-2885 (1982); Inorg. Chem.. 18, 2023-2025 (1979); Inorg. Synthesis, 173-176 (1960); and Journal of Physical Chemistry. 56, 22-25 (1952).<br>
iii. Transition Metal Complexes of Macropolycyclic Rigid Ligands -Compositions herein may also suitably include as bleach catalyst a transition metal complex of a macropolycyclic rigid ligand. The phrase "macropolycyclic rigid ligand" is sometimes abbreviated as "MRL" in discussion below. The amount used is a catalytically effective amount, suitably about 1 ppb or more, for example up to about 99.9%, more typically about 0.001 ppm or more, preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 500 ppm (wherein "ppb" denotes parts per billion by weight and "ppm" denotes parts per million by weight).<br>
Suitable transition metals e.g., Mn are illustrated hereinafter. "Macropolycyclic" means a MRL is both a macrocycle and is polycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic. The term "rigid" as used herein herein includes "having a superstructure" and "cross-bridged". "Rigid" has been defined as the constrained converse of flexibility: see D.H. Busch., Chemical Reviews.. (1993), 93, 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid" as used herein means that the MRL must be determinably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacking a superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) found in the MRL's. In determining the comparative rigidity of macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will use the free form (not the metal-bound form) of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well-known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, measuring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zimmer, Chemical Reviews. (1995), 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al., Inorganica Chimica Acta. (19891 164,73-84.<br>
Preferred MRL's herein are a special type of ultra-rigid ligand which is cross-bridged. A "cross-bridge" is nonlimitingly illustrated in 1.11 hereinbelow. In 1.11, the cross-bridge is a -<br>
CH2CH2- moiety. It bridges N   and N   in the illustrative structure. By comparison, a "same-<br>
side" bridge, for example if one were to be introduced across N   and N      in 1.11, would not be<br>
sufficient to constitute a "cross-bridge" and accordingly would not be preferred.<br>
Suitable metals in the rigid ligand complexes include Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(ll), Fe(III), Fe(IV), Co(I), Co(II), Co(III), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), Cu(I), Cu(II), Cu(Ill), Cr(II), Cr(HI), Cr(IV), Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(III), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), W(V), W(VI), Pd(II), Ru(II), Ru(III), and Ru(lV). Preferred transition-metals in the instant transition-metal bleach catalyst include manganese, iron and chromium.<br>
More generally, the MRL's (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts) herein suitably comprise:<br>
(a)	at least one macrocycle main ring comprising four or more heteroatoms; and<br>
(b)	a covalently connected non-metal superstructure capable of increasing the rigidity of the<br>
macrocycle, preferably selected from<br>
(i) a bridging superstructure, such as a linking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and<br>
(iii) combinations thereof.<br>
The term "superstructure" is used herein as defined in the literature by Busch et al., see, for example, articles by Busch in "Chemical Reviews".<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it coordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 below, can be used.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Fig. 1 wherein n is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Fig. 2<br>
wherein m and n are integers from about 1 to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, trialkylammonium, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or<br>
the like. The aromatic ring in 1.10 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, O, S or C.<br>
Suitable MRL's are further nonlimitingly illustrated by the following compound:<br>

Dichloro-5-n-butyl-12-methyl-1,5,8,12-tetraaza- bicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane Manganese(II).<br>
(f) Other Bleach Catalysts - The compositions herein may comprise one or more other bleach catalysts. Preferred bleach catalysts are zwitterionic bleach catalysts, which are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,576,282 (especially 3-(3,4-dihydroisoquinolinium) propane sulfonate   Other bleach catalysts include cationic bleach catalysts are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,360,569, 5,442,066, 5,478,357, 5,370,826, 5,482,515, 5,550,256, and WO 95/13351, WO 95/13352, and WO 95/13353.<br>
As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and cleaning processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per hundred million of the active bleach catalyst species in the aqueous washing medium, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 25 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 10 ppm, and most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to about 5 ppm, of the bleach catalyst species in the wash liquor. In order to obtain such levels in the wash liquor of an automatic washing process, typical compositions herein will comprise from about 0.0005% to about 0.2%, more preferably from about 0.004% to about 0.08%, of bleach catalyst, especially manganese or cobalt catalysts, by weight of the cleaning compositions.<br>
Preferably, the peroxygen source is selected from hydrogen peroxide sources selected from the group consisting of perborate compounds, percarbonate compounds, perphosphate compounds and mixtures thereof, and a bleach activator.<br>
Preferably, the bleach activator is selected from the group consisting of hydrophobic bleach activators as disclosed herein.<br>
The purpose of such a bleaching composition is to mitigate unwanted decomposition of the organic catalyst, and to allow the peracid to achieve bleaching performance on a fabric in need of cleaning, such as a stained fabric, in a wash solution prior to the availability of the organic catalyst.<br>
The period of time between the peracid becoming active in a wash solution and the organic catalyst compounds becoming active can be in the range of from about 1 second to about 24 hours. Alternatively, since the organic catalyst compounds are relatively stable in the wash solution, the peracid can become active in the wash solution after the organic catalyst compound becomes active or available.<br>
The purpose of a delayed addition bleaching composition (which may or may not be used in conjunction with this invention) is to allow the peracid to achieve maximum bleaching performance on a fabric in need of cleaning, such as a stained fabric, in a wash solution prior to the introduction of the organic catalyst compound. In other words, a bleaching composition comprising a organic catalyst compound which becomes active in a wash solution after a fabric in<br>
need of cleaning has been added to the wash solution. Alternatively, since the organic catalyst compounds can have increased stability, a bleaching composition comprising an organic catalyst compound which becomes active in a wash solution prior to a fabric in need of cleaning has been added to the wash solution may be used.<br>
The bleaching compositions of the present invention also comprise, in addition to one or more organic catalysts, described hereinbefore, one or more cleaning adjunct materials, preferably compatible with the organic catalyst(s) and/or any enzymes present in the bleaching composition. The term "compatible", as used herein, means the bleaching composition materials do not reduce the bleaching activity of the organic catalyst and/or any enzymatic activity of any enzyme present in the bleaching composition to such an extent that the organic catalyst and/or enzyme is not effective as desired during normal use situations. The term "cleaning adjunct materials", as used herein, means any liquid, solid or gaseous material selected for the particular type of bleaching composition desired and the form of the product (e.g., liquid; granule; powder; bar; paste; spray; tablet; gel; foam composition), which materials are also preferably compatible with the protease enzyme(s) and bleaching agent(s) used in the composition. Granular compositions can also be in "compact" form and the liquid compositions can also be in a "concentrated" form.<br>
The specific selection of cleaning adjunct materials are readily made by considering the surface, item or fabric to be cleaned, and the desired form of the composition for the cleaning conditions during use (e.g., through the wash detergent use). Examples of suitable cleaning adjunct materials include, but are not limited to, surfactants, builders, bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, other enzymes, enzyme stabilizing systems, chelants, optical brighteners, soil release polymers, dye transfer agents, dispersants, suds suppressors, dyes, perfumes, colorants, filler salts, hydrotropes, photoactivators, fluorescers, fabric conditioners, hydrolyzable surfactants, preservatives, anti-oxidants, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fungicides, color speckles, silvercare, anti-tarnish and/or anti-corrosion agents, alkalinity sources, solubilizing agents, carriers, processing aids, pigments and pH control agents as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,705,464, 5,710,115, 5,698,504, 5,695,679, 5,686,014 and 5,646,101. Specific bleaching composition materials are exemplified in detail hereinafter.<br>
If the cleaning adjunct materials are not compatible with the protease variants) in the bleaching compositions, then suitable methods of keeping the cleaning adjunct materials and the protease variant(s) separate (not in contact with each other) until combination of the two components is appropriate can be used. Suitable methods can be any method known in the art, such as gelcaps, encapulation, tablets, physical separation, etc.<br>
Such bleaching compositions include detergent compositions for cleaning hard surfaces, unlimited in form (e.g., liquid, granular, paste, foam, spray, etc.); detergent compositions for<br>
cleaning fabrics, unlimited in form (e.g., granular, liquid, bar formulations, etc.); dishwashing compositions (unlimited in form and including both granular and liquid automatic dishwashing); oral bleaching compositions, unlimited in form (e.g., dentifrice, toothpaste and mouthwash formulations); and denture bleaching compositions, unlimited in form (e.g., liquid, tablet).<br>
The fabric bleaching compositions of the present invention are mainly intended to be used in the wash cycle of a washing machine; however, other uses can be contemplated, such as pretreatment product for heavily-soiled fabrics, or soaking product; the use is not necessarily limited to the washing-machine context, and the compositions of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with compatible handwash compositions.<br>
The bleaching compositions may include from about 1% to about 99.9% by weight of the composition of the cleaning adjunct materials.<br>
As used herein, "non-fabric bleaching compositions" include hard surface bleaching compositions, dishwashing compositions, oral bleaching compositions, denture bleaching compositions and personal cleansing compositions.<br>
When the bleaching compositions of the present invention are formulated as compositions suitable for use in a laundry machine washing method, the compositions of the present invention preferably contain both a surfactant and a builder compound and additionally one or more cleaning adjunct materials preferably selected from organic polymeric compounds, bleaching agents, additional enzymes, suds suppressors, dispersants, lime-soap dispersants, soil suspension and anti-redeposition agents and corrosion inhibitors. Laundry compositions can also contain softening agents, as additional cleaning adjunct materials.<br>
The compositions of the present invention can also be used as detergent additive products in solid or liquid form. Such additive products are intended to supplement or boost the performance of conventional detergent compositions and can be added at any stage of the cleaning process.<br>
When formulated as compositions for use in manual dishwashing methods the compositions of the invention preferably contain a surfactant and preferably other cleaning adjunct materials selected from organic polymeric compounds, suds enhancing agents, group II metal ions, solvents, hydrotropes and additional enzymes.<br>
If needed the density of the laundry detergent compositions herein ranges from 400 to 1200 g/litter, preferably 500 to 950 g/litter of composition measured at 20°C.<br>
The "compact" form of the bleaching compositions herein is best reflected by density and, in terms of composition, by the amount of inorganic filler salt; inorganic filler salts are conventional ingredients of detergent compositions in powder form; in conventional detergent compositions, the filler salts are present in substantial amounts, typically 17-35% by weight of the<br>
total composition. In the compact compositions, the filler salt is present in amounts not exceeding 15% of the total composition, preferably not exceeding 10%, most preferably not exceeding 5% by weight of the composition. The inorganic filler salts, such as meant in the present compositions are selected from the alkali and alkaline-earth-metal salts of sulfates and chlorides. A preferred filler salt is sodium sulfate.<br>
Liquid bleaching compositions according to the present invention can also be in a "concentrated form", in such case, the liquid bleaching compositions according the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Typically the water content of the concentrated liquid bleaching composition is preferably less than 40%, more preferably less than 30%, most preferably less than 20% by weight of the bleaching composition. Cleaning Adjunct Materials<br>
While not essential for the purposes of the present invention, several conventional adjuncts illustrated hereinafter are suitable for use in the instant bleaching compositions and may be desirably incorporated in preferred embodiments of the invention, for example to assist or enhance cleaning performance, for treatment of the substrate to be cleaned, or to modify the aesthetics of the bleaching composition as is the case with perfumes, colorants, dyes or the like. The precise nature of these additional components, and levels of incorporation thereof, will depend on the physical form of the composition and the nature of the cleaning operation for which it is to be used. Unless otherwise indicated, the bleaching compositions of the invention may for example, be formulated as granular or powder-form all-purpose or "heavy-duty" washing agents, especially laundry detergents; liquid, gel or paste-form all-purpose washing agents, especially the so-called heavy-duty liquid types; liquid fine-fabric detergents; hand dishwashing agents or light duty dishwashing agents, especially those of the high-foaming type; machine dishwashing agents, including the various tablet, granular, liquid and rinse-aid types for household and institutional use; liquid cleaning and disinfecting agents, including antibacterial hand-wash types, laundry bars, mouthwashes, denture cleaners, car or carpet shampoos, bathroom cleaners; hair shampoos and hair-rinses; shower gels and foam baths and metal cleaners; as well as cleaning auxiliaries such as bleach additives and "stain-stick" or pre-treat types.<br>

Said diamines provide for increased removal of grease and greasy food material while maintaining suitable levels of suds.<br>
The diamines suitable for use in the compositions of the present invention have the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein each R20 is independently selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, linear or branched alkyl, alkyleneoxy having the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

The preferred diamines of the present invention have a pK1 and pK.2 which are each in<br>
the range of from about 8 to about 11.5, preferably in the range of from about 8.4 to about 11, more preferably from about 8.6 to about 10.75. For the purposes of the present invention the term "pKa" stands equally well for the terms "pK1" and "pK2" either separately or collectively. The<br>
term pKa as used herein throughout the present specification in the same manner as used by those of ordinary skill in the art pKa values are readily obtained from standard literature sources, for<br>
example, "Critical Stability Constants: Volume 2, Amines" by Smith and Martel, Plenum Press,<br>
N.Y. and London, (1975).<br>
As an applied definition herein, the pKa values of the diamines are specified as being<br>
measured in an aqueous solution at 25° C having an ionic strength of from about 0.1 to about 0.5 M. As used herein, the pKa is an equilibrium constant dependent upon temperature and ionic<br>
strength, therefore, value reported by literature references, not measured in the above described<br>
manner, may not be within full agreement with the values and ranges which comprise the present invention. To eliminate ambiguity, the relevant conditions and/or references used for pKa's of<br>
this invention are as defined herein or in "Critical Stability Constants: Volume 2, Amines". One<br>
typical method of measurement is the potentiometric titration of the acid with sodium hydroxide and determination of the pKa by suitable methods as described and referenced in "The Chemist's<br>
Ready Reference Handbook" by Shugar and Dean, McGraw Hill, NY, 1990.<br>
Preferred    diamines    for    performance    and    supply    considerations    are     1,3-bis(methylamino)cyclohexane,    1,3-diaminopropane (pKi=10.5; pK2=8.8), 1,6-diaminohexane<br>

ADDITIONAL DETERGENT COMPONENTS<br>
The following are non-limiting examples of additional detergent components (adjunct ingredients) useful in the bleaching compositions, especially laundry detergent compositions, of the present invention, said adjunct ingredients include builders, optical brighteners, soil release polymers, dye transfer agents, dispersants, enzymes, suds suppressers, dyes, perfumes, colorants, filler salts, hydrotropes, photoactivators, fluorescers, fabric conditioners, hydrolyzable surfactants, preservatives, anti-oxidants, chelants, stabilizers, anti-shrinkage agents, anti-wrinkle agents, germicides, fungicides, anti corrosion agents, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Builders - The bleaching compositions of the present invention preferably comprise one or more detergent builders or builder systems. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder, preferably from about 5%, more preferably from about 10% to about 80%, preferably to about 50%, more preferably to about 30% by weight, of detergent builder.<br>
The level of builder can vary widely depending upon the end use of the composition and its desired physical form. When present, the compositions will typically comprise at least about 1% builder. Formulations typically comprise from about 5% to about 50%, more typically about 5% to about 30%, by weight, of detergent builder. Granular formulations typically comprise from about 10% to about 80%, more typically from about 15% to about 50% by weight, of the detergent builder. Lower or higher levels of builder, however, are not meant to be excluded.<br>
Inorganic or P-containing detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of polyphosphates (exemplified by the<br>
tripolyphosphates, pyrophosphates, and glassy polymeric meta-phosphates), phosphonates, phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates. However, non-phosphate builders are required in some locales. Importantly, the compositions herein function surprisingly well even in the presence of the so-called "weak" builders (as compared with phosphates) such as citrate, or in the so-called "underbuilt" situation that may occur with zeolite or layered silicate builders.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2:Na2O ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium<br>
silicates described in U.S. 4,664,839 Rieck, issued May 12, 1987. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6").<br>
Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as<br>
those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+ryH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4,<br>
preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use<br>
herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crispening agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15,1973.<br>
Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. 3,985,669, Krummel et al, issued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the<br>
designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X.   In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, "polycarboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in U.S. 3,128,287 Berg, issued April 7, 1964, U.S. 3,635,830 Lamberti et al., issued January 18, 1972, and U.S. 3,936,448 Lamberti, issued February 3, 1976. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. 4,663,071 Bush et al., issued May 5, 1987. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. 3,923,679 Rapko, issued December 2, 1975; U.S. 4,158,635 Crutchfield et al., issued June 19, 1979; U.S. 4,120,874 Crutchfield et al., issued October 17, 1978; and U.S. 4,102,903 Crutchfield et al., issued July 25, 1978.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccihic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the bleaching compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicar-boxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. 4,566,984, Bush,<br>
issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986.<br>
Other suitable polycarboxylates are disclosed in U.S. 4,144,226, Crutchfield et al., issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent<br>
3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the<br>
compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
In situations where phosphorus-based builders can be used, and especially in the formulation of bars used for hand-laundering operations, the various alkali metal phosphates such as the well-known sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium pyrophosphate and sodium orthophosphate can be used. Phosphonate builders such as ethane-l-hydroxy-l,l-diphosphonate and other known phosphonates (see, for example, U.S. Patents 3,159,581; 3,213,030; 3,422,021; 3,400,148 and 3,422,137) can also be used.<br>

The lime soap peptiser compound is preferably present at a level from 0% to 20% by weight.<br>
., A numerical measure of the effectiveness of a lime soap peptiser is given by the lime soap dispersant power (LSDP) which is determined using the lime soap dispersant test as described in an article by H.C. Borghetty and C.A. Bergman, J. Am. Oil. Chem. Soc., volume 27, pages 88-90, (1950). This lime soap dispersion test method is widely used by practitioners in this art field being referred to, for example, in the following review articles; W.N. Linfield, Surfactant science Series, Volume 7, page 3; W.N. Linfield, Tenside surf, det., volume 27, pages 159-163, (1990); and M.K. Nagarajan, W.F. Masler, Cosmetics and Toiletries, volume 104, pages 71-73, (1989). The LSDP<br>
is the % weight ratio of dispersing agent to sodium oleate required to disperse the lime soap deposits formed by 0.025g of sodium oleate in 30ml of water of 333ppm CaCo3 (Ca:Mg=3:2)<br>
equivalent hardness.<br>

Known amylases (a and/or 6) can be included for removal of carbohydrate-based stains. WO 94/02597, Novo Nordisk A/S published February 03, 1994, describes cleaning compositions which incorporate mutant amylases. See also WO94/18314, Genencor, published August 18, 1994 and WO95/10603, Novo Nordisk A/S, published April 20, 1995. Other amylases known for use in bleaching compositions include both a- and p-amylases. a-Amylases are known in the art and include those disclosed in US Pat. 5,003,257; EP 252,666; WO 91/00353; FR 2,676,456; EP 285,123; EP 525,610; EP 368,341; and British Patent Specification No. 1,296,839 (Novo). Other<br>
suitable amylase are stability-enhanced amylases including PURAFACT OX AM® describes WO 94/18314, published August 18/1994 and WO96/05295, Genencor, published February 22. 1996 and amylase variants from Novo Nordisk A/S, disclosed in WO 95/10603, published April 95.<br>

Other amylolytic enzymes with improved properties with respect to the activity level and the combination of thermostability and a higher activity level are described in W095/35382.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a mannanase enzyme. Preferably, the mannanase is selected from the group consisting of: three mannans-degrading enzymes : EC 3.2.1.25 : ß-mannosidase, EC 3.2.1.78 : Endo-l,4-|3-mannosidase, referred therein after as "mannanase" and EC 3.2.1.100 : 1,4-ß-mannobiosidase and mixtures thereof. (IUPAC Classification- Enzyme nomenclature, 1992 ISBN 0-12-227165-3 Academic Press).<br>
More preferably, the treating compositions of the present invention, when a mannanase is present, comprise a ß-I,4-Mannosidase (B.C. 3.2.1.78) referred to as Mannanase. The term "mannanase" or "galactomannanase" denotes a mannanase enzyme defined according to the art as officially being named mannan endo-l,4-beta-mannosidase and having the alternative names beta-mannanase and endo-l,4-mannanase and catalysing the reaction: random hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-D- mannosidic linkages in mannans, galactomannans, glucomannans, and galactoglucomannans.<br>
In particular, Mannanases (EC 3.2.1.78) constitute a group of polysaccharases which degrade mannans and denote enzymes which are capable of cleaving polyose chains containing mannose units, i.e. are capable of cleaving glycosidic bonds in mannans, glucomannans, galactomannans and galactogluco-mannans. Mannans are polysaccharides having a backbone composed of 0-1,4- linked mannose; glucomannans are polysaccharides having a backbone or more or less regularly alternating ß-1,4 linked mannose and glucose; galactomannans and galactoglucomannans are mannans and glucomannans with α-1,6 linked galactose sidebranches. These compounds may be acetylated.<br>
The degradation of galactomannans and galactoglucomannans is facilitated by full or partial removal of the galactose sidebranches. Further the degradation of the acetylated mannans, glucomannans, galactomannans and galactogluco-mannans is facilitated by full or partial deacetylation. Acetyl groups can be removed by alkali or by mannan acetylesterases. The<br>
oligomers which are released from the mannanases or by a combination of mannanases and α-galactosidase and/or mannan acetyl esterases can be further degraded to release free maltose by 0-mannosidase and/or (3-glucosidase.<br>
Mannanases have been identified in several Bacillus organisms. For example, Talbot et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Vol.56, No. 11, pp. 3505-3510 (1990) describes a beta-mannanase derived from Bacillus stearothermophilus in dimer form having molecular weight of 162 kDa and an optimum pH of 5.5-7.5.

The compositions of the present invention may also comprise a xyloglucanase enzyme. Suitable xyloglucanases for the purpose of the present invention are enzymes exhibiting endoglucanase activity specific for xyloglucan, preferably at a level of from about 0.001% to about 1%, more preferably from about 0.01% to about 0.5%, by weight of the composition. As used herein, the term "endoglucanase activity" means the capability of the enzyme to hydrolyze 1,4-ß-D-glycosidic linkages present in any cellulosic material, such as cellulose, cellulose derivatives, lichenin, ß-D-glucan, or xyloglucan. The endoglucanase activity may be determined in accordance with methods known in the art, examples of which are described in WO 94/14953 and hereinafter.

or a sequence homologous thereto encoding a polypeptide specific for xyloglucan with<br>
endoglucanase activity,<br>
ii) is immunologically reactive with an antibody raised against a highly purified endoglucanase encoded by the DNA sequence defined in i) and derived from Aspergillus aculeatus, CBS 101.43, and is specific for xyloglucan.<br>
More specifically, as used herein the term "specific for xyloglucan" means that the endoglucanse enzyme exhibits its highest endoglucanase activity on a xyloglucan substrate, and preferably less than 75% activity, more preferably less than 50% activity, most preferably less than about 25% activity, on other cellulose-containing substrates such as carboxymethyl cellulose, cellulose, or other glucans.<br>
Preferably, the specificity of an endoglucanase towards xyloglucan is further defined as a relative activity determined as the release of reducing sugars at optimal conditions obtained by incubation of the enzyme with xyloglucan and the other substrate to be tested, respectively. For instance, the specificity may be defined as the xyloglucan to ß-glucan activity (XGU/BGU), xyloglucan to carboxy methyl cellulose activity (XGU/CMCU), or xyloglucan to acid swollen Avicell activity (XGU/AVIU), which is preferably greater than about 50, such as 75,90 or 100.<br>
The term "derived from" as used herein refers not only to an endoglucanase produced by strain CBS 101.43, but also an endoglucanase encoded by a DNA sequence isolated from strain CBS 101.43 and produced in a host organism transformed with said DNA sequence. The term "homologue" as used herein indicates a polypeptide encoded by DNA which hybridizes to the same probe as the DNA coding for an endoglucanase enzyme specific for xyloglucan under certain specified conditions (such as presoaking in SxSSC and prehybridizing for 1 h at -40°C in a solution of 5xSSC, 5xDenhardt's solution, and 50 ug of denatured sonicated calf thymus DNA, followed by hybridization in the same solution supplemented with 50 µCi 32-P-dCTP labeled probe for 18 h at -40°C and washing three times in 2xSSC, 0.2% SDS at 40°C for 30 minutes). More specifically, the term is intended to refer to a DNA sequence which is at least 70% homologous to any of the sequences shown above encoding an endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan, including at least 75%, at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90% or even at least 95% with any of the sequences shown above. The term is intended to include modifications of any of the DNA sequences shown above, such as nucleotide substitutions which do not give rise to another amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by the sequence, but which correspond to the codon usage of the host organism into which a DNA construct comprising any of the DNA sequences is introduced or nucleotide substitutions which do give rise to a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different amino acid sequence and therefore, possibly, a different protein structure which might give rise to an endoglucanase mutant with different properties than the native enzyme. Other examples of possible modifications are insertion of one<br>
or more nucleotides into the sequence, addition of one or more nucleotldes at either end of the sequence, or deletion of one or more nucleotides at either end or within the sequence.<br>
Endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan useful in the present invention preferably is one which has a XGU/BGU, XGU/CMU and/or XGU/AVIU ratio (as defined above) of more than 50, such as 75, 90 or 100.<br>
Furthermore, the endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan is preferably substantially devoid of activity towards ß-glucan and/or exhibits at the most 25% such as at the most 10% or about 5%, activity towards carboxymethyl cellulose and/or Avicell when the activity towards xyloglucan is 100%. In addition, endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan of the invention is preferably substantially devoid of transferase activity, an activity which has been observed for most endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan of plant origin.<br>
Endoglucanase specific for xyloglucan may be obtained from the fungal species A. aculeatus, as described in WO 94/14953. Microbial endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan has also been described in WO 94/14953. Endoglucanases specific for xyloglucan from plants have been described, but these enzymes have transferase activity and therefore must be considered inferior to microbial endoglucanses specific for xyloglucan whenever extensive degradation of xyloglucan is desirable. An additional advantage of a microbial enzyme is that it, in general, may be produced in higher amounts in a microbial host, than enzymes of other origins.<br>
The xyloglucanase, when present, is incorporated into the treating compositions of the invention preferably at a level of from 0.0001% to 2%, more preferably from 0.0005% to 0.1%, most preferred from 0.001% to 0.02% pure enzyme by weight of the composition.<br>
The above-mentioned enzymes may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial, fungal and yeast origin. Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Also included by definition, are mutants of native enzymes. Mutants can be obtained e.g. by protein and/or genetic engineering, chemical and/or physical modifications of native enzymes. Common practice as well is the expression of the enzyme via host organisms in which the genetic material responsible for the production of the enzyme has been cloned.<br>
Said enzymes are normally incorporated in the bleaching composition at levels from 0.0001% to 2% of active enzyme by weight of the bleaching composition. The enzymes can be added as separate single ingredients (prills, granulates, stabilized liquids, etc. containing one enzyme ) or as mixtures of two or more enzymes ( e.g. cogranulates).<br>
Other suitable detergent ingredients that can be added are enzyme oxidation scavengers. Examples of such enzyme oxidation scavengers are ethoxylated tetraethylene polyamines.<br>

TEST PROTOCOL I:<br>
General / Parameters: All solutions are maintained at 20 °C. Adjustments of pH as required are accomplished using either sodium carbonate or sulfuric acid as appropriate. All solutions are continuously stirred at 500 rpm, except small (1-5 mL) dye bleaching solution (DBS) aliquots removed to measure absorbance. Absorbance values are measures at the lmax of the reference<br>
dye solution (RDS). Peracetic acid, 32 wt. % solution in dilute acetic acid is purchased from Aldrich (#26,933-6).<br>
OC is the organic catalyst.<br>
OCS is the organic catalyst containing solution prepared by dissolving 0.010 mmoles (typically about 2-3 mg, depending on the molecular weight) of an organic catalyst (OC) at 20 °C in 5 mL of deionized water immediately prior (within one minute) of the time at which the OCS is added to the base solution. If the organic catalyst is not soluble in 5 mL of deionized water, an additional 5 mL of an organic solvent is added to 5 mL of deionized water to aid in the dissolution of the organic catalyst. Organic solvents used are methanol, ethanol, dimethylformamide, or acetonitrile. If the organic catalyst is not soluble in a 1:1 mixture of deionized water and organic solvent, the organic catalyst is dissolved in 100% organic solvent. If the organic catalyst is found to be insoluble in the above solvent media, the organic catalyst is added to the base solution in pure form.<br>
BS is the base solution to which the OCS is added. The base solution is prepared by mixing 1.0 L of deionized water with 10 mg (10 ppm) of a chelant (capable of sequestering transition metal ions in order to avoid decomposition of peracetic acid and/or bleaching species) and a sufficient quantity of sodium carbonate such that upon the addition of 76 mg (76 ppm, 1.0 mmol) of peracetic acid (based on 100% activity), the solution pH is between 9.9 and 10.1. At one minute of stirring, the BS preparation is complete.<br>
OCBS is the organic catalyst containing base solution prepared by the addition of the OCS to 1 L of the just prepared BS. Upon addition of OCS to BS, the OCBS preparation is complete. The OCBS should now have a pH of 10.0 (between 9.9 and 10.1). If the pH is not within this range, the OCBS preparation will need to be repeated, such that the addition of the OCS to the BS is performed along with the addition of sodium carbonate or sulfuric acid in a manner that results in the preparation of an OCBS with a pH of 10.0 (between 9.9 and 10.1).<br>
CDS is the concentrated dye solution, defined as a 90 pnm solution of T,op=by 19,968-0) in deionizcd water at pH 10..<br>
DBS is the dye bleaching solution formed from the addition of a 100 mL aliquot of the OCBS to 10 mL of CDS. The DBS should have an initial pH of 10.0. If (in the unlikely event) the pH of the DBS drops below 9.6 at time = trj (defined below), the pH must be controlled such that during the interval trj the pH must remain between 9.8 and 10.1.<br>
WQC is a parameter in the final test protocol used to describe the weight of organic catalyst (OC),<br>
based on 100% purity, used to form the organic catalyst solution (OCS). The default value of the parameter is 0.010 mmoles, added to 1.0 L of BS.<br>
Determination of Amax.   100 mL of deionized water at pH 10 is added to 10 mL of CDS. The<br>
absorbance of the resulting homogeneous reference dye solution (RDS) determined by UV-Visible Spectroscopy at the lmax (approximately 518 nm) is Amax. The RBS should have a pH<br>
of 10.0.<br>
ddec 's a parameter in the test protocol describing the time that elapses between the formation of the OCBS and the formation of the dye bleaching solution (DBS) via the addition of the OCBS to the CDS. This value is the decomposition duration of the organic catalyst in the OCBS prior to addition to the CDS. The default value of the parameter ddec (e.g., ddec = 15 min) is defined in the claim set. The value of the parameter ddec is defined to be equal to the value of the parameter<br>
dref-<br>
dref is a parameter in the test protocol describing the time that elapses between the completion of the BS preparation and the formation of the dye bleaching solution (DBS) via the addition of the BS to the CDS. This value is the reference duration of peracid in the BS prior to addition to the CDS. The default value of the parameter dref (e.g., dref = 15 min) is defined in the claim set. The value of the parameter dref is defined to be equal to the value of the parameter ddeC'<br>
dbleach is a parameter in the test protocol describing the time that elapses between the formation of the dye bleaching solution (DBS) and data acquisition. This value is the bleaching duration of the DBS formed from either the addition of BS or OCBS to the CDS. The default value of the parameter dbleacn is 5 min.<br>
Test Protocol (Part I):<br>
The initial step is the preparation of the BS as described. The time of completion of the BS preparation is set to t = 0. A 100 mL aliquot of the BS is withdrawn at dref and added all at once<br>
to 10.0 mL of CDS. A 1-5 mL aliquot, R, of the resulting DBS is withdrawn immediately prior to the absorbance determination (data acquisition). Absorbance of R is measured at the lmax at the conclusion of dbleach.<br>
The time at which the absorbance determination (data acquisition) of aliquot R is measured is defined as IR. Therefore, it is required that IR = dref + ddbleach The absorbance value measured at IR is defined as Atfgy The symbol dA^R) is defined as Amax<br>
Test Protocol (Part II):<br>
The initial step is the preparation of the OCBS as described. The time of completion of the OCBS preparation is set to t = 0. A 100 mL aliquot of the OCBS is withdrawn at d(jec and added all at<br>
once to 10.0 mL of CDS. A 1-5 mL aliquot, D, of the resulting DBS is withdrawn immediately prior to the absorbance determination (data acquisition). Absorbance of D is measured at the 'max at the conclusion of ddbleach.<br>
The time at which the absorbance determination (data acquisition) of aliquot D is measured is defined as tD Therefore, it is required that tD = ddec + dbieach- The absorbance value measured at ID is defined as At(D). The symbol dAt(D) is defined as Amax -<br>
Organic catalyst lifetime (OCL) is defined as the value ofddec (or the time the OC spends in the OCBS) such that the value of dAt(D) = 3 x dAt(R)<br>
Two cases exist, depending upon the values of dAt(rj) compared to the value of dA((R)_<br>
Case A: If for the lower limit (e.g., 30 seconds) of organic catalyst lifetime the value of dAt(rj) 3 3 x dAt(R), and for the upper limit (e.g., 15 minutes) of organic catalyst lifetime the value of dAt(D) £ 3 x dAt(R) then a fast-acting organic catalyst is indicated, and the OC falls within the<br>
boundaries of this invention.<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
To CH3CN (12.3 g, 0.3 mol) in a 250 mL three-necked round-bottom flask equipped with thermometer and adapter, mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, ice bath and pressure equalizing addition funnel is added slowly (WARNING! Very SLOW addition, at or below 10 °C, is<br>
necessary to avoid splattering) concentrated H2SO4 (29.4 g, 0.3 mol). To the mixture of CH3CN and H2SO4 is added slowly (keeping the temperature at or below 10 °C) 10 mL of glacial acetic<br>
acid. The ice bath is removed and the mixture is stirred rapidly as 2-methyl-l-phenyl-2-propanol (0.30 mol) is added over 5 min, while keeping the temperature of the solution at or below 60 °C (via cooling bath). The solution is allowed to stir at room temperature for 3 days. The viscous oil is poured into ice (500 g) with the aid of water (150 mL), CH2C12 (50 mL), and a 10% NfyOH<br>
solution (150 mL). The lower organic layer is separated, and the aqueous layer is washed with CH2C12 (100 mL), and the combined organic layers are washed with brine, dried over MgSO4 and concentrated. The solid is recrystallized from ether / CH2C12 to give 3.<br>
Step 2: Preparation of 1,3,3-trimethyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (4);<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Typical procedure for the synthesis of dihydroisoquinoline is as described in the art, as in Larsen, R. D. et. a). J. Org. Chem. 1991,56, 6034. The described procedure is used for the conversion of the amide 2 to l,3,3-trimethyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline (3). The crude product is purified by Kugelrohr distillation (0.25 mm Hg /100 -110 °C) to give 3 as a light yellow oil.<br>
Step 3: Preparation of l,3,3-trimethyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoliniume tetrafluoroborate (4):<br>

Beginning after one hour, additional 8 ml aliquots of 88% formic acid are added over a 2 h period until the 3-phenylpropylamine is consumed, as monitored by gas chromatography. The reaction mixture is distilled (using a Dean-Stark trap) at 200 °C for 3 hours after which it is allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
A 500 mL round-bottom flask equipped with overhead mechanical stirrer, reflux condenser, and addition funnel is charged with phosphorus pentoxide (38.6 g) and polyphosphoric acid (168 g). The mixture is stirred and heated at 180 °C for about 8 h, then cooled to 150 °C. The cooled, crude 3-phenylpropylformamide prepared as described above is added dropwise to this mixture. On complete addition the reaction is heated and stirred at 170 °C overnight. The mixture is<br>
cooled to room temperature and diluted with ice water (1.0 L), washed with diethyl ether (500 mL) and cooled in a brine/ice bath while the pH is adjusted to 9 with saturated potassium hydroxide. The aqueous solution is extracted with ether (2 x 250 mL) and the pooled organics are dried over magnesium sulfate, filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure to yield an oil which solidifies upon addition of ether/hexane, and filtered to give 4,5-dihydro-3H-2-benzazepine, 10.<br>
A 250 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with magnetic stir bar, argon inlet, addition funnel, and reflux condenser is charged with 4,5-dihydro-3H-2-benzazepine (10, 1.45 g, 10.0 mmol) and acetonitrile (10 mL). This mixture is cooled in an ice bath and charged dropwise with a solution of 1,3-propane sultone (1.34 g, 11.0 mmol) in acetonitrile (5 mL). On complete addition the ice bath is removed and the reaction is heated to reflux overnight. The mixture is allowed to cool to room temperature and volatiles are removed under reduced pressure. The solid 2-(3-sulfonato) propyl-4,5-dihydro-3H-2-benzazepine (12) is slurried and rinsed with acetone, and allowed to air dry.<br>
