				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	NEW MATERIALS FOR LITHOGRAPHIC PLATES COATINGS,<br>
LITHOGRAPHIC PLATES AND COATINGS CONTAINING SAME, METHODS OF<br>
PREPARATION AND USE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	This invention relates to novel materials useful for lithographic plates<br>
coatings and to plates, coatings and coating solutions containing these materials.<br>
More specifically, these new materials and coating solutions are useful in the<br>
preparation of coatings for lithographic offset printing plates for direct digital imaging<br>
by near-infrared laser radiation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	On-press developable negative-working lithographic offset printing<br>
plates are known in the prior art. Fox example, US patent No. 5,569,573 teaches<br>
lithographic printing plates comprising a laser imaging layer containing<br>
microencapsulated oleophilic materials in hydrophilic polymer binders. EP 0 770 495<br>
A1 teaches lithographic printing plates comprising near infrared absorption materials,<br>
polymer binders and thermoplastic particles capable of coalescing under heat. US<br>
patent No. 6,983,694 teach on-press developable negative-working offset printing<br>
plates coated with near infrared sensitive coating compositions comprising<br>
thermoplastic polymer particles, such as polystyrene or poly(acrylonitrile-co-styrene)<br>
particles, non-reactive hydrophilic polymer binder and near infrared absorption dyes.<br>
[0004]	Also, US patent No. 6,261,740 teaches negative-working offset<br>
printing plates coated with near infrared sensitive coating compositions containing<br>
methoxymethacrylamide copolymers, phenolic resins, iodoniuni salts and near<br>
infrared absorption dyes. US patents No. 6,124,425 and 6,177,182 teach on-press<br>
developable negative-working offset printing plates coated with thermally near-infrared<br>
absorbing polymers, which undergo cross-linking reactions via cationic polymerization<br>
upon exposure to near infrared radiation. The near infrared chromophoric moieties are<br>
functionalized to the polymeric backbone via ether and ammonium bonds. US Patent<br>
No. 6,960,422 teaches negative-working offset printing plates, which contain a near<br>
infrared sensitive base-coat compositions comprising molecular near infrared dyes,<br>
radical generators, radical polymerizabie urethane compounds, reactive polymer<br>
binders and other additives.<br><br>
[0005]	Moreover, US Patent No. 6,969,575 and 7,001,704 teach on-press<br>
developable negative-working offset printing plates having an image-forming layer,<br>
which comprise near infrared absorbing microcapsules and acid generator compound.<br>
US patent No. 6,582,882 and co-pending US patent application 2003/0157433; US<br>
patent 6,899,994 and US patent application 2005/0123853 teach on-press<br>
developable negative-working offset printing plates, which are coated with thermally<br>
imageable compositions containing polymer binders, initiator systems and<br>
polymerizable components. The described polymer binders are copolymers having<br>
non-reactive polyethylene oxide and polypropylene block, or graft copolymers having<br>
non-reactive polyethylene oxide side chains co-polymerized with acrylonitrile, styrene<br>
and other monomers. The polymerizable components are viscous liquid oligomers<br>
containing multiple acrylic functional groups. The initiator system contains near<br>
infrared absorption dyes and radical producing compounds, such as triazine and<br>
iodonium salts.<br>
[0006]	All of these coating compositions and printing plates show some<br>
disadvantages such as having a tacky surface which causes difficulties for handling<br>
and storage, exhibiting phase separation and/or surface crystallization, being difficult<br>
to prepare, requiring high laser power to achieve imaging, having poor substrate<br>
adhesion and consequently failing to provide sufficient run length on press, not being<br>
developable on-press, exhibiting poor scratching resistance, requiring an over-coating<br>
layer and/or a special substrate surface treatment and being expensive to<br>
manufacture.<br>
[0007]	There thus remains a need for new materials and new coatings for<br>
lithographic plates that would overcome some or all of the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>

salts, polyvinyl alcohol acetal copolymers and polymer binders of the invention. More<br>
specifically, one such method for preparing an iodonium salt of the invention<br>
comprises attaching a pendant group to an iodonium salt, wherein the pendant group<br>
is obtained by reacting a mono-isocyanate, a di-isocyanate or a poly-isocyanate with<br><br>
an amine or an alcohol, which is terminated by one or more groups each<br>
independently selected from acrylate, methacrylate and vinyl-ether.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0082]	The present invention is illustrated in further details by the following non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
[0083]	In these examples, these syntheses were performed in a 4 necks glass<br>
reactor equipped with a water condenser, a mechanical stirrer, a dropping funnel and<br>
a nitrogen or air gas inlet. The molecular structures of the obtained materials were<br>
determined by proton NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The average molecular weight of<br>
the copolymers obtained was determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC),<br>
using N,N-dimethylformarnide (DMF) solutions and calibrated with polystyrene<br>
standards. The UV-Visible near-infrared spectra of the synthesized polymers were<br>
measured in methanol solutions or on the solid films using a UV-VIS<br>
spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Model Lambda 35™).<br>
[0084]	Also, the coated plates were imaged using Creo Trendsetter 3244™<br>
equipped with 830 nm lasers. The imaged plate was mounted on AB Dick™ duplicator<br>
press using black ink (available from Pacific Inks, Vietnam) and fountain solution<br>
containing 3.0 parts of MYLAN-FS100™ in 97.0 parts of water (available from MyLan<br>
Chemicals Inc., Vietnam).<br>
