				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention refers to the device in the spinning mill preparation for separation<br>
of carrier air during charging of fibre materials, as for example cotton and the<br>
equivalent to a processing machine in which a filing chute mainly vertical is<br>
provided for the fibre material where an equipment with pneumatic fibre supply<br>
is allocated to the upper entry opening and an equipment for flocculation with a<br>
taking-in equipment and a rapid running opening roller allocated to the lower exit<br>
and at which least one air permeable surface for separation (elimination) of fibre<br>
materials from carrier air stream and an equipment for discharge of carrier air<br>
stream are present which in the carrier air stream is guided along the opening<br>
roller.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In a known device (DE-OS 3217668) the entire carrier air stream flows along the<br>
opening roller and gets into post laid flock chute with an air permeable wall<br>
surface. The carrier air stream is separated from the fibre flocks and followingly<br>
discharged while the fibre flocks are transported further through a roller. The<br>
carrier air stream is drawn in for compression of fibre flocks deposited in the<br>
flock chute. It is disadvantageous that in practice the carrier air stream which<br>
transports the fibre flocks to upper reserve chute fluctuates, so that also the<br>
separated carrier air stream is irregular in considerable quantity.<br>
EP.0563700 discloses an apparatus for controlling the air flow volume in an air<br>
canal wherein a fibre shaft with three air impermeable walls and with an air-<br>
permeable wall has an airfibre.<br>
The present invention discloses a device at the spinning mill peration for<br>
seperation of carrier air during charging of fibre materials as for example cotton<br>
or the equivalent to a processing machine, the seperation takes place due to<br>
creation of differenical air pressure in the seperation chamber.<br>
The assignment therefore lies at the base of the invention to procure a device<br>
described at entry which avoids the mentioned disadvantages which specially<br>
makes possible the pneumatic carrying away of the released fibre flocks to a<br>
reconnected equipment and for this permits the formation of a carrier air<br>
stream of constant or mainly constant quantity.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place through the characteristic<br>
features as described in the embiment of the invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Through it that a part air stream is separated from the eliminated carrier air<br>
stream and the quantity of the part air stream is adjustable, a carrier air<br>
stream of constant or mainly constant quantity is generated. In this way it is<br>
possible to use the changing air stream for disposal of the separator and<br>
consequently to reduce the energy and processing cost of the pneumatic<br>
material transport. A further advantage exists therein that in the application<br>
of machine couplings in which the charging air stream is greater than the<br>
disposing air stream, the charging air flow is to be distributed with the help of<br>
the regulating system such that the air stream under disposal receives a<br>
constant quantity.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention is further explained closer followingly with the help of<br>
diagramatically represented execution examples.<br>
It shows:<br>
Figure 1 Schematically in side view part of a spinning mill preparation plant<br>
with the device as per invention.<br>
Figure 2 Block diagram of the unit as per Fig.l with statement of air flow<br>
and<br>
Figure 3 Side view of an execution design of the equipment as per<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
As per Figure 1 a separator 1, as for example Truetzschler-Oeffner TXL 4, a<br>
fibre material cutter 2, as for example Truetzschler material separator Mas, a<br>
fibre material store 3, as for example fibre material store MSC with separator<br>
equipment 4, as for example metering separator and a fibre flock feed 5, as<br>
for example Truetzschler SCANFEED, are connected in series. In place of the<br>
separator 1 also a cleaner as for example Truetzschler cleaner CVT 4, can be<br>
input. With a the working direction is denoted.<br>
For the pneumatic flock conveying between the separator 1 and the material<br>
eliminator 2 a pipeline 6 and between the metering separator 4 and the fibre<br>
flock feed 5 a pipe line 7 are present. The fibre material is removed from the<br>
last roller la of the four roller separators 1 through an air stream B, which is<br>
sucked through a assembled in pipe line 6-fibre material conveying fan 8.<br>
The fibre flock-air-mixture C is flung on the inside wall surface of a perforated<br>
plate 10 of material separator over distribution gate 9, wherein the fibre<br>
flocks D are separated from the carrier air E. The carrier air E gets into an<br>
exhaust chamber 11, to which an exhaust channel 12 and an exhaust pipe<br>
line 13 are connected in each case with their one end. The other end of the<br>
exhaust with the pipe line 7. In the exhaust channel 13 a gate 14 capable of<br>
swinging is present. In the pipe line 7 a material conveyor fan 15 is<br>
assembled.<br>
Below the perforated plate 10 a vertical flock chute 16 with air permeable<br>
wall surfaces are assemble at whose lower end a metering separator 4 is<br>
located which shows two compression rollers 4a, 4b, two slow running<br>
opening roller 4c, 4d,and a rapid running opening roller 4e. The uniform<br>
charge of flock feed 5 is important, due to which before the flock feed 5 the<br>
metering separator is input. This metering separator 4 takes care of a<br>
continuous charging of the flock feed 5.<br>
In this way a device for elimination of the carrier air E during charging in a<br>
(not represented) processing machine as for example card or combing is<br>
obtained in which one mainly vertical filing chute 16 for the fibre material D is<br>
provided to whose upper entry opening, the material separator 2 as<br>
equipment with pneumatic fibre supply is allocated and to whose lower exit<br>
opening the metering separator 4d as equipment for flocculation with a<br>
taking in equipment 4a to 4d and a rapid running opening roller 4e are<br>
allocated and in which the perforated plate 10 as air permeable surface for<br>
separation (elimination) of fibre materials D from the carrier-air stream E and<br>
the exhaust chamber 11, the exhaust channel 12 and the exhaust pipe line 13<br>
are present as equipment for discharge of carrier air stream E. A part air<br>
stream F of separated carrier air stream E enters in the exhaust channel 12,<br>
in which as air stream regulating equipment the swiveling air gate 14 is<br>
present. The carrier air stream E reduced by the part air stream F enters as<br>
air stream G in the exhaust air pipe line 13 and is led along the opening roller<br>
4e. Therein the air stream G blows - supported through the centrifugal<br>
force- the fibre flocks H released by the opening roller 4e in the pipe line 7.<br>
The device as per invention removes the disadvantage according to which -<br>
as the practice shows - no clear, stationary air amounts in combination of<br>
multiple number of machines are present. In order to use the charging air<br>
quantity for carrying away of conditioned fibre amounts further, for ensuring<br>
a clear function a matching of this air quantity to the requirement of following<br>
machine as per invention takes place. Therein a reduction of volume of<br>
stream under utilization of charging air stream for carrying away of fibre<br>
materials take place.<br>
As pre figure 2 in the separator 1 - schematically represented -air stream<br>
from the (not represented) previous machine enters. Starting from separator<br>
1 an air stream C (as for example 4000 m3/h) carrying fibre flocks enters the<br>
material separator 2, which enters the opening in perforated plate C through<br>
to the exhaust air chamber 11 as air stream E. From the air stream E, the<br>
part air stream F (as for example 1000 m3/h) is branched off in the exhaust<br>
air pipe line 12, so that the reduced air stream G (as for example 3000 m3/h)<br>
flows to the opening roller 4e. From here onward the air stream H loaded<br>
with flocks flows through the pipe line 7 to the flock feed 5.<br>
According to Figure 3 in a set-up for fibre processing, a separator 4 with<br>
integrated store 3 is input. This separator 4 possesses a vertical store chute<br>
16, in which the material to be processed is blown in with the help of carrier<br>
air stream. For separation of material and air, areas of chute 14 with comb -<br>
or perforated plate type air exit opening 16a are provided through which the<br>
carrier air stream can escape. The material processed in separator 4 is<br>
grasped behind the opening roller 4a by a second carrier air stream H and is<br>
supplied to the nest machine.<br>
In this way the charging air stream is used for disposal of separator 4 and<br>
consequently the energy - and processing cost of the pneumatic material<br>
transport id reduced. In the application of this principle on machine couplings, in<br>
which the charging air stream is greater that the disposing air stream, with the<br>
help of a regulating system, the charging air stream is so distributed that the<br>
disposing air stream receives a constant quantity. For this as adjustment item a<br>
pneumatic cylinder 17 is allocated to the swiveling exhaust gate 14 around a<br>
swivel joint 14a in direction of arrows I, K, which stands in combination over an<br>
electrical control-and regulating equipment (18) with an air measuring element<br>
19 which is allocated to the pipe line 7.<br>
The air stream VI separated over the air exit opening 16a is gathered inside<br>
the machine in the collection chamber 20, supplied to the opening roll area<br>
and in suction area with the opened material of pipe line 7 is given over to<br>
the next machine. In order that the pressure differences at the air exit<br>
surface and consequently the through going stream of air volume stream<br>
remains always below a critical value, through a fresh air opening (exhaust<br>
channel 12) the possibility is attained to suck an air volume stream V2 out of<br>
the room. This principle is only capable of functioning, if the air volume<br>
stream V3 under suction is greater than the charging air volume stream V1.<br>
In many cases of application a constant volume stream is required for the<br>
following machines, since only thus the possibility is given, to cover the filing<br>
condition of following machine over a pressure signal. Herein in charging air<br>
volume stream V1 is gathered in room 20, for admission of the separated<br>
material in the suction line 21. The reducing air volume stream is given over<br>
a volume measuring nozzle 19 (measuring orifice - or venturi tube) in order<br>
to determine the air volume V3 under suction with the help of pressure<br>
difference P1 and P2 in a measuring converter 27 and to convert to a<br>
corresponding measuring signal. The generated measuring signal is supplied<br>
to a control unit 19 which operates the throttle valve 14 depending on the<br>
preadjusted reference value over the adjustment equipment 17. Depending<br>
on the throttle valve adjustment the excess air stream V2 is fitted to it"s<br>
quantity and is supplied to absorption equipment (as for example filter).<br>
Through here it is ensured that the air volume stream V3 guiding further the<br>
material receives always stream V3 guiding further the material receives<br>
always a constant quantity as difference of volume streams V1-V2<br>
