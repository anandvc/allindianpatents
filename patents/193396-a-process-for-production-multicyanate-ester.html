b)	feeding to said reaction vessel a second feedstream comprising a cyanogen halide in a reaction medium comprising a solvent;<br>
c)	feeding to said reaction vessel a recycle stream comprising at least one of the following compounds selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine-hydrohalide salt, solvent, impurities, multicyanate ester and mixtures thereof;<br>
d)	reacting said first, second, and recycle streams in said reaction<br>
vessel to form a reaction product stream comprising at least one of the<br>
following compounds selected from the group consisting of tertiary amine-<br>
hydrohalide salt, solvent and impurities and based upon the total weight of<br>
the reaction product stream excluding the weight of said tertiary amine-<br>
hydrohalide salt, from 10 percent to 40 percent of a multicyanate ester; and<br>
e)	removing a portion of said reaction product stream to produce said<br>
