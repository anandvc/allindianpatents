				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a tactile interface device for nodule palpation in a perception<br>
enhanced form. More particularly, the invention relates to a tactile interface device<br>
comprising a deformable force stretch array (DFSA) sensor and an actuator for nodule<br>
palpation in a perception enhanced form adapted for medical diagnosis.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
In clinical practice doctors routinely palpate the patient's body with the fingers and palm to<br>
detect indwelling lumps and smaller nodules. However, correct diagnosis of pathological<br>
conditions such as the presence of tumor and lumps can be obtained only through expert<br>
palpation. Moreover, even when the nodule is detected, estimation of its clinically significant<br>
parameters such as its size and depth below the skin surface poses considerable difficulties.<br>
Thus, there is a need for sensors that can augment palpation acuity for nodules, especially in<br>
homogeneous body tissue such as the breast. However, there are still considerable unknowns<br>
regarding how the palpating hand actually senses a nodule, with a number of scientific<br>
controversies on this subject.<br>
M. H. Lee, H. R. Nicholls, Review Article Tactile sensing for mechatronics-a state of the art<br>
survey, Mechatronics, ED-9 ( 1) ( 1999) 1 31 indicates that there are sensed parameters other<br>
than force and pressure. Additional parameters such as slippage, shear and hardness are more<br>
difficult to define and quantify by sensor technology. Moreover, sensed parameters in<br>
palpation for a breast nodule using several fingers and the palm differ from that for palpation<br>
with one finger as for example for feeling the wall 'rigidity' of the radial artery at the wrist.<br>
Nevertheless, palpation for the former case seems to assess a combination of point forces,<br>
global 'hardness' and its regional variations together with skin shape changes.<br>
The earliest approach, which was used to model such a scenario, was an array of sensor<br>
elements oriented to measure pressure normal to the surface. R. F. Wolfenbuttel, P. P. L.<br>
Regtien, Polysilicon bridges for the realization of tactile sensors. Sensors and Actuators A -<br>
Physical, ED-26 ( 1-3) ( 1991) 257 264 reported some of the earliest tactile sensor designs<br>
utilizing silicon fabrication technology. Their sensor designs for arrays of force sensing<br>
elements use piezoresistive and capacitive transduction principles.<br>
C. Domenici, D. De Rossi, A stress-component-selective tactile sensor array, Sensor<br>
andActuatorsA-Physical, ED. 31 (1-3) (1992) 97 100 reported a stress.component-selective<br>
tactile sensor array. The array was developed with the aim of obtaining a skin-like sensor<br>
able to perform fine-form discrimination of objects in contact with it. A tactile transducer for<br>
pressure distribution measurement on the sole of the foot was reported in J. Volf, S. Holy, J.<br>
Vlcek, Using of tactile transducer for pressure-distribution measurement on the sole of the<br>
foot. Sensor and Actuators A-Physical, ED-62(l-3) (1997) 556 561 The tactile carpet is<br>
based on conductive rubber of Japanese origin and uses standard tactel arrays.<br>
S. Omata, Y. Terunama, New tactile sensor like the human hand and its applications, Sensor<br>
and Actuators A-Physical, ED- 35 (1) (1992) 9 15, reported a new tactile sensor that was<br>
able to detect the hardness/softness of an extraneous substance impressed upon it. The sensor<br>
has a piezoelectric resonator and works on the principle that contact with an object will cause<br>
a change in its resonating frequency. A similar purpose active tactile sensor for detecting<br>
contact force and hardness of an object has been reported in M. Shikida, T. Shimizu, K. Sato,<br>
K. Itoigawa, Active tactile sensor for detecting contact force and hardness of an object,<br>
Sensor and Actuators A-Physical, ED- 103 (1-2) (2003) 213 218. A sensor system consisting<br>
of a piezoelectric (PZT) transducer and a pressure sensor element has also been reported in<br>
S. Omata, Y. Murayama, C. E. Constantinou, Real time robotic tactile sensor system for the<br>
determination of the physical properties of biomaterials, Sensor and Actuators A-Physical,<br>
ED- 112 (2-3) (2004) 278 285 for the determination of biomaterials' properties. The sensor<br>
developed uses the strain gauge element to detect contact pressure in addition to employing<br>
similar principles for the PZT disc transducer as outlined above. Work on other related force<br>
and stress sensors having tactile applications has also been reported in several publications.<br>
US6726638 discloses a direct manual examination of remote patient with virtual examination<br>
functionality.<br>
US6428323 relates to a system for teaching students to perform medical exams performed<br>
manually inside a body cavity. The device has an anatomical simulator with a simulator<br>
cavity, a tactile sensor in the simulator, and a feedback presentation unit in communication<br>
with the sensor. This device is that it is only suitable for cavities. Further the device does not<br>
give a tactile perception and is not suitable for diagnostic examination but more for medical<br>
teaching.<br>
US6336812 relates to a clinical and/or surgical training apparatus in which there is a housing<br>
providing a simulation of at least part of a body and a plurality of simulations of internal<br>
body structures for reception in the housing, these simulations being a set of simulations of a<br>
particular part of the anatomy and being of increasing anatomical complexity and/or<br>
presenting increasing clinical or surgical difficulty. The limitation however with the system is<br>
that it gives anatomical display of body organ as told in the databank and such display is not<br>
related to an individual patient. The device is suitable for medical teaching and not effective<br>
for clinical diagnosis.<br>
US Patent Application No.20030219705 relates to an interactive breast examination training<br>
model which is used for the training of physicians and other medical personnel on techniques<br>
for clinical breast examinations. The device cannot be linked to an actual patient examination<br>
and the factor of elasticity of skin has not been taken into account for the purpose of the<br>
examination. Moreover, the system is suited for training and not actual treatment.<br>
WO 02/43558 describes a device in which the elasticity of a human or animal organ is<br>
measured by the generation of an ultrasonic signal after ultrasonic illumination which are<br>
represented in the form of two or three dimensional form. The device has several drawbacks<br>
and the most critical being that it gives only force feedbacks.<br>
Additional parameters such as slippage, shear and hardness are more difficult to define and<br>
quantify by sensor technology. Sensed parameters in palpation for a breast nodule using<br>
several fingers and the palm differs from that for palpation with one finger as for example for<br>
feeling the wall 'rigidity' of the radial artery at the wrist. Palpation to detect the presence of a<br>
tumor within a living body essentially is a task of contact pressure and shear force<br>
distribution mapping and spatial discrimination. The earliest approach, which was used to<br>
model such scenario, was an array of sensor elements oriented to measure pressure normal to<br>
the surface.<br>
While the art reported deals with several aspects of tactile sensors but there is a long felt need<br>
to provide a tactile sensor that can identify small and deep seated nodules embedded in<br>
homogenous tissue to provide a reliable means for nodule detection in the breast.<br>
The present inventors have found that a tactile interface device comprising a novel deformable<br>
force stretch array (DFSA) sensor designed in a manner that it can augment palpation for<br>
nodules, even the small and deep-seated nodules of homogeneous tissue and can transduce the<br>
perception of the nodule with enhanced sensitivity.<br>
OBJECTS OF INVENTION<br>
Thus the basic object of the present invention is to provide a tactile interface device comprising<br>
deformable force stretch array (DFSA) sensor and an actuator for accurate identification of<br>
small and deep seated nodules.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a tactile interface device comprising<br>
deformable force stretch array (DFSA) sensor which can also be used for diagnosing actual<br>
information from an object which is not capable of being directly palpated.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a tactile interface device comprising<br>
deformable force stretch array (DFSA) sensor and an actuator for routine diagnosis.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a tactile interface<br>
device for nodule palpation in a perception enhanced form as if said nodule is larger and closer<br>
to palpating hand, said device comprising:<br>
(i) a deformable force stretch array sensor and/or sensor comprising<br>
plurality of components comprising one or more first major components<br>
and one or more second major components; wherein said first major<br>
component has predetermined rigidity; and said second major<br>
component is operatively interconnected with the first major<br>
components; whereby solid angle subtended on said palpating hand<br>
surface is relatively more than solid angle subtended at said nodule and<br>
(ii) actuator means for indwelling nodule simulation, being operatively<br>
connected with said deformable force stretch array sensor, and adapted<br>
to provide perception of the nodule in the body.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The tactile interface device of the present invention enables nodule palpation in a perception<br>
enhanced form. This is possible due to the combination of the deformable force stretch array<br>
(DFSA) and the three dimensional actuator. The various components of the DFSA have been<br>
designed and combined so as to identify a nodule by the interpretation of the deformable force<br>
stretch array data.<br>
The deformable force stretch array (DFSA) sensor and/or sensor comprises plurality of<br>
components comprising first major component and second major component. The first major<br>
component comprises one or more transducers (tactels), preferably ten in number, which are<br>
deformable but are more rigid than body tissue part to be palpated. This differential in<br>
deformability mimics the fact that the palpating hand is less deformable than the body part<br>
palpated. The said transducers or tactels are standard strain gauges that are attached to spring<br>
leafs and are provided with miniature cylinder and piston guides. The latter ensures linear<br>
tactel tip movement perpendicular to the tactel base<br>
The second major component comprises one or more elastic stretch elements adapted to bridge<br>
the tips of the tactels and conform to the body surface contour in between the tactels without<br>
exerting significant force onto the body. These elements are stretch sensors giving length<br>
proportional output. Thus the inter-tactel spaces can be assessed.<br>
Additionally when the sensor base is tilted the relative extensions of the various stretch<br>
elements provide an indication of the shape of the indwelling nodule within the surrounding<br>
soft tissue of the body.<br>
In the DFSA's system the input side of the tactile interface is the tactile sensor array, DFSA,<br>
which is a combination of vertical deformable force sensing tactels with linked electrical<br>
resistance varying stretch elements. The system enables the analysis of the tactel force and<br>
the extension of the stretch elements gives a very good indication of small and deep seated<br>
nodules. The device is pressed on the body and the tactel-stretch element data is processed to<br>
corresponding electrical signals determines the presence of a nodule, size of the nodule and<br>
location of the nodule.<br>
When the three dimensional actuator is pressed with the hand gives a feel of nodule presence.<br>
This actuator is physically co-operatively located above the sensor array but there is no<br>
mechanical linkage between the two subunits. The processed electrical signals from the<br>
sensor array by feed-forward control modifies the bulk elasticity; size of phantom nodule;<br>
and location of the phantom nodule. The three dimensional actuator when touched by hand<br>
gives the feel of the phantom nodule. As a result of the interpretation of the DFSA data and<br>
feedback control of the phantom nodule gives a better perception than the actual nodule<br>
palpated without the help of the system according to the invention.<br>
The signals from the DFSA are processed by the amplification and signal-processing unit and<br>
are subsequently transmitted to the actuator controls. The actuator controls regulate the size<br>
and shape of the nodule as well as the general tissue and skin elasticity perceived by the<br>
doctor's hand. The actuator consists of a pouch, which can be filled with fluid, placed inside<br>
a cubical box. The cubical box provides the structural framework for the fluid filled pouch,<br>
which serves as the body tissue analog. It is filled with fluid - usually water - by means of a<br>
tube that opens into the pouch. A syringe controls the flow of water through the tube. The<br>
syringe itself is operated by a slider crank mechanism powered by a DC motor. By means of<br>
the above arrangement, it is possible to regulate the water inside the body tissue analog to the<br>
tune of micro-liters.<br>
The power provided by the DC motor depends on the processed DFSA signals that indicate<br>
the bulk elasticity of the body tissue. In accordance with the signals, the amount of liquid to<br>
be input through the tubes is estimated. For example, if a hard body tissue is sensed then the<br>
DC motor is regulated to a larger input power such that more fluid is pumped in to the<br>
diaphragm. This gives a perception of a harder body tissue to the hand that is in contact with<br>
the actuator. Above this fluid-filled diaphragm, a latex sheet is stretched out and connected<br>
to a tensioning motor. This motor is controlled by the DFSA signals that indicate the skin<br>
elasticity of the body part. The sheet is stretched out more if the body part is sensed by the<br>
DFSA to have "tighter" skin and vice-versa. These two separate arrangements together give a<br>
combined feel of the elasticity of the skin and tissue being sensed.<br>
The phantom nodule is placed inside the body tissue analog. A spherical bag, which can be<br>
filled with fluid, simulates the phantom nodule. It is positioned by means of a X-Y-Z control<br>
(e.g., a probe), which is in turn controlled by the DFSA position and depth information. The<br>
size of the bag is varied in a similar fashion to the variation of elasticity of the body tissue<br>
analog. Depending upon the DFSA nodule size information, the phantom nodule is filled with<br>
water by a variable pressure pump. A mechanism similar to the syringe-slider crank-DC<br>
motor arrangement described above could be used. Thus, the position, depth and size of the<br>
phantom nodule are subjected to fine control in the 3-D actuator setup. Consequently, the<br>
user gets an enhanced perception of the actual nodule that is detected in the body part by the<br>
DFSA sensor.<br>
WORKING OF INVENTION<br>
Control analysis<br>
Case I: Force exerted on the transducers (tactels)<br>
2-D analysis, where tactels along a particular Z-column are subjected to the same force, is<br>
undertaken to simplify the contact elasticity problem. Uniform vertical pressure 'p' acts on<br>
the rigid tactel base having width 'b', depth 'd' and length 'L' where d
base is treated as a semi-infinite body.<br>
Further, the force exerted on the base is considered as a combination of infinite number of<br>
line loads along the X-axis that give a uniform pressure distribution 'p' on the base. Each of<br>
these line loads ' W' exerts stress on any given point on the lower surface of the slab (the<br>
surface on which the tactel elements are attached). As per standard solid mechanics analysis,<br>
due to a line load on the surface of a semi-infinite body, the following equation is achieved :<br><br>
where (r, 0) defines the position of the point with respect to the line load. Therefore, the<br>
stress in the Y-direction at the point x = xi due to the line load W in terms of p is given by:<br><br>
Substituting rcos9 = d which restricts the domain to the top surface loading in Eq. (4) and<br>
integrating for all such line loads, the line load equation is<br><br>
Thus for equilibrium, the sum of all the tactel reaction forces is equal to the total force on the<br>
base undersurface. Thus, the force on each tactel is calculated by dividing the entire slab A<br>
into NxM portions (where there are NxM tactels) - each such portion being treated as the<br>
"zone of influence" of the respective tactel. Force transmitted onto a particular tactel is then<br>
calculated as the total force that corresponds to its zone of influence on the base<br>
undersurface.<br><br>
where Fi is the force transmitted onto the ith tactel and N and M are the number of total tactels<br>
along the X and Z axes respectively.<br>
Case II: Deformation of the transducers (tactels)<br>
The tactel deformation is determined by calculating the contact pressure at the tactel-slab<br>
interface needs. The displacement and the force on the tactile element are related by the<br>
following equation (7)<br><br>
E1 = elasticity of the tactels,<br>
E2 = elasticity of slab A,<br>
a = contact radius, and<br>
d = total displacement of the contact point.<br>
The localized deformations of the tactels and the slab A at the interface are estimated from<br>
the following Eqs. (8, 9):<br><br>
where d1 = deformation of the tactel,<br>
h = nominal length of the tactel,<br>
pc = contact force,<br>
A = area of tactel tip.<br><br><br>
By the superposition principle, the displacement of the contact point at the tactel-slab<br>
interface is equal to the sum of the deformations of the two bodies in contact. Thus,<br><br>
From Eqs (7, 8, 9, 10), the following equation is achieved:<br><br>
Therefore, the deformation of the tactile element d1 is determined by evaluating pc from Eq<br>
(11) and substituting the value obtained in Eq (8).<br>
Case III: Deformation of the stretch elements<br>
The slab A applies a normal pressure ps(x) on the stretch element between x = -a and x - a<br>
(the end points of the stretch element) thereby causing a vertical displacement v(x). ps(x) is<br>
estimated in terms of the forces acting on the tips of the tactels (from Eq. (6)) to which the<br>
stretch element is joined.<br>
The surface displacement distribution due to a line load of Ws per unit length acting<br>
vertically at x = § is given by:<br><br><br>
v = v for plane stress approximation,<br>
E and v are the elastic material constants for the stretch elements.<br>
Analysis for sensor pressed onto a body tissue analog with a nodule<br>
Deformation of transducers (tactels) and extension of the stretch element:<br>
To analyze the presence of two separate displacement fields is taken into account: the<br>
displacement field (81) due to top surface loading of tactel base and the displacement field (u)<br>
due to the presence of a rigid nodule I (Enodule&gt;&gt; E2). The net deformation is calculated by<br>
the superposition of these two fields.<br>
The governing equation for the displacement field u of the elastic slab, in the presence of the<br>
rigid nodule I, is given by:<br>
div(?u)=0 (13)<br>
The displacement on the nodule surface is zero (the 'no flux condition') since the nodule is<br>
significantly more rigid as compared to the surrounding slab. Thus, the following boundary<br>
condition is ahieved:<br><br>
where v is the unit exterior normal to d1 and r is any infinitesimal rigid displacement.<br>
Knowledge of the parameters of I enables the determination of the displacement field u. Eqs<br>
(13, 14) are analogous to fluid mechanics formulations where the flow past a solid object is<br>
computed. The stream function (?), analogous to the displacement function, satisfies a<br>
similar governing equation as Eq (13) coupled with the no flow (zero velocity) condition<br>
across the boundary of the solid object (similar to Eq (14)). The stream function ? for flow<br>
past a cylinder of radius r is obtained by combining the expression of stream function for a<br>
doublet with that for rectilinear flow and is given by:<br>
 (15)<br>
where v0 is the velocity of uniform flow in the x-direction.<br>
Similarly, the displacement function u of an elastic slab having an embedded nodule of<br>
radius r at a depth of dnodulc is:<br>
 (16)<br>
where k is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the impressed traction pressure and<br>
the equivalent elasticity of the slab tactile combination (keq).<br>
From Eq. (16) and Eq. (8) the net tactel deformations are obtained. From these deformations,<br>
the contact forces at the slab-tactel interface are estimated. This leads to the determination of<br>
the extension of the stretch elements using Eq. (12).<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to non-limiting embodiment of the<br>
invention illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
In figure 1 DFSA sensor configuration with sensor pressed upon a deformable slab is<br>
illustrated. The slab body (8) as shown bulging upwards between the tactel tips. Enlarged<br>
view of a tactile element (la) (tactel) is shown on the top left corner (Please see view X).<br>
From view X it is realizable that the sensor device comprises tactel base (1) which is<br>
substantially rectangular having rigid base upon which the linear guide (6) is attached along<br>
with the strain gauge (2) and leaf spring (3). It has height 'd' and length '1' and width 'b' in<br>
the Z-direction (not shown in the figure). The Strain gauge (2) measures the strain of each<br>
tactel (la). The strain gauge (2) has a gauge factor ranging from 1.5 to 150 and resistance<br>
ranging from 50 to 5000 ohms. Spring leaf (3) is attached to the strain gauge (2) which are<br>
both connected to the linear guide (6). The leaf (2) bends proportional to the tactel force.<br>
The linear guide (6) is constituted by an arrangement of cylinder (4) and piston (5) and<br>
ensures linear tactel tip movement perpendicular to the tactel base (1).<br>
The tactel (la) is constituted by the strain gauge (2), spring leaf (3) and linear guide (6) and<br>
has a nominal length of 'h'. In the embodiment shown in Figure 1 the tactels (la) are ten in<br>
number. Stretch element (10) joins the tips of the tactel (la).<br>
Nodule (9) is embedded in Body (8) and the sensor is placed on the body part (or as in this<br>
experimental case the homogeneous slab) during palpation. When the sensor is placed on the<br>
body multiple bulges dissimilar in shape and magnitude are created between different pair of<br>
tactels and the maximum bulge is limited to the bulge(max) (12) of the stretch element (10).<br>
Tactels (5) ensure linear tactel tip movement perpendicular to the tactel base.<br>
The differential in deformability mimics the fact that the palpating hand is less deformable<br>
than the body part palpated. Only when such a condition prevails can the tissues of the body<br>
part be compressed to get a feel of underlying nodule. If the reverse condition occurs, as<br>
happens for the very rigid abdomen in peritonitis, the palpating hand is unable to discern<br>
nodules.<br>
The elastic stretch elements (10) bridge the tips of the tactels and conform to the body surface<br>
contour in between the tactels without exerting significant force onto the body. These<br>
elements are stretch sensors that give length proportional output. Thus the inter-tactel tissue<br>
bulge can be determined. The stretch elements provide a combination of geometric (such as<br>
nodule curvature) and dynamometric (such as elasticity) information about the body tissue.<br>
Biomechanical analysis of a human body palpation model comprising of DFSA pressed upon<br>
a homogenous elastic slab containing a hard nodule shows that the sensor enables<br>
identification of the location of relatively small and deep seated nodules. The DFSA is able to<br>
estimate the nodule position, size and depth as well as the elasticity of the surrounding body<br>
tissue. Normally a nodule would have size between 5-15 mm. Larger sizes are referred<br>
to as "lumps". An 8 mm nodule occurring at a depth of from 3- 50 mm in homogeneous tissue<br>
can be sensed by the DFSA.<br>
In figure 2 schematic view of three dimensional actuator of the present invention is illustrated.<br>
The rubber sheet (13) is stretched out and connected to the skin tensioning motor (14). It<br>
simulates the skin surface. The skin tensioning motor (14) tensions/stretches the rubber sheet<br>
(13). A Fluid filled bag (15) serves as the body tissue analog. A phantom nodule (21) that is<br>
placed inside the bag (15). The X-Y-Z control (16) controls the position of the phantom<br>
nodule (21). Its operation is controlled by the DFSA signals of nodule depth and location. A<br>
variable pressure pump (18) is used to pump fluid into the bag (15). Another Variable<br>
pressure pump (19) is used to pump fluid into the phantom nodule (21) XYZ control (16).<br>
Control signals (20) are generated by sensor, signal processor and actuator controls (22) are<br>
sent to the variable pressure pumps (18) and (19). The DFSA sends signals to the signal<br>
processor, which sends the processed signal to the actuator control as shown in the figure (2).<br>
In figure 3 comparison of tactile strain without nodule (diamonds), with nodule of 8 mm<br>
diameter (crosses) and with nodules of 16 mm diameter (circles). Nodule depth = 50 mm. is<br>
illustrated. The elasticity of the slab (8) is 0.075 times the elasticity of the tactels<br>
(E2=0.075xE,) It is realizable from the figure that the strain difference between the central<br>
tactels (numbers 5 and 6) and the extreme peripheral tactels (numbers 1 and 10) is a<br>
parameter of significance. It has a value of 0.0096, 0.0237 and 0.0648 for the cases of no<br>
nodule, an 8 mm nodule at a depth of 50 mm and a 16 mm nodule at a depth of 50 mm being<br>
embedded in the homogeneous slab. This is also illustrated in table A given below. The<br>
presence of nodule thus gives a marked difference from the control experiment result. These<br>
figures suggest that a strain difference of 0.02 or more is indicative of the presence of nodule<br>
of size over 8 mm at 50 mm depth. With non-deforming tactels such detection would not<br>
have been possible.<br><br>
In figure 4 comparison of inter-tactel slab material bulge without nodule (diamonds), with<br>
nodule of 8 mm diameter (crosses) and nodules of 16 mm diameter (circles). Nodule depth =<br>
50 mm is illustrated. Inter-tactel tissue bulge is quantified by the stretch elements and<br>
improves nodule detection. A "bulge parameter" (Bp - average inter-tactel tissue bulge<br>
divided by inter-tactel distance) is computed for nodules of various sizes (Fig. 4). Bp for the<br>
no-nodule case is close to zero throughout the sensor array while for the 8 mm and the 16<br>
mm nodules this value is considerably larger. Therefore an average bulge/inter-tactel distance<br>
value of over 0.1 indicates the presence of nodule and together with the tactel strain data is<br>
able to give unambiguous determination of the presence or absence of a nodule of 8 mm or<br>
over in size at a depth of 50 mm or less.<br>
In figure 5 SI and BI graphs for different nodule sizes and depth for deriving the size and<br>
depth data from values of SI and BI a representative example of marking for SI=9.6 and<br>
BI=5.6 is illustrated. The data of the graphs are restructured by computing two parameters<br>
termed STRAIN INDEX (SI) and BULGE INDEX (BI), where<br>
 Central tactel strain - Peripheral tactel strain<br>
SI=---------------------------------------------------------, and<br>
Peripheral tactel strain<br>
Averagebulgeincentralstretchelement - Average bulge in peripheralstretch element<br>
BI=---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
Average bulge in peripheralstretch element<br>
respectively.<br>
In the expressions for both the parameters, slab elasticity figures in the numerator as well as<br>
in the denominator. Consequently, the resultant indices become independent of the body<br>
elasticity value. The SI and B1 values have been computed for various nodule sizes and<br>
depths and are represented in in the figure.<br>
In figure 6 lines parallel to the abscissa represents specific SI and BI values of SI=9.6 and<br>
BI=5.6. An intersection with both SI and B1 graphs which gives the same nodule size and<br>
depth is the correct match which gives nodule size of 23 mm at a depth of 40 mm. Similarly,<br>
for other experimental values of SI and BI the nodule size and depth data can be obtained.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
A DFSA sensor prototype of the present invention comprises a strain gauge attached to a<br>
phosphor-bronze spring leaf, which is again operatively connected to a miniaturized piston-<br>
cylinder arrangement. The cylinder is realized using a 16 gauge hypodermic needle and the<br>
piston with a sewing needle having a sliding fit within the lumen of the hypodermic needle.<br>
The strain gauges used have a resistance of 120 ohms (O) and a gauge factor of 2. This setup<br>
makes up one tactel, which has a nominal length of 10 mm. The tactels are attached to a hard<br>
plastic base and juxtaposed to each other having predetermined spacing between each of the<br>
tactels. The predetermined spacing is maintained at 10 mm by the use of suitable washers. For<br>
the stretch elements, carbon compound impregnated conductive elastomers, manufactured by<br>
Timpac Engineers, India, are used. The ends of each of these elastomers are fixed to tactel tips.<br>
As the spacing between the tactels is 10 mm, the nominal length of the stretch elements is also<br>
10 mm.<br>
Experiments with the prototype built DFSA sensor are carried out on a variable elasticity<br>
model. The variable elasticity model comprises sponge, with a nodule embedded in it, kept<br>
inside a hard plastic box. The sponge is soaked with varying quantities of water to simulate a<br>
variable elasticity model. This is performed by means of a water-air cylinder arrangement,<br>
where a thin tube connects the water volume in the cylinder to the sponge and another tube is<br>
provided with pressure gauge and bellows adapted to control air column in the cylinder. The<br>
top surface of the sponge is covered with a rubber diaphragm so as to prevent water leakage.<br>
The diaphragm, however, does not exert any significant force on the sponge.<br>
When the diaphragm is palpated some water from the sponge is squeezed out into the water-air<br>
cylinder. However, the air in the cylinder gives an 'elastic' reaction which alters the equivalent<br>
elasticity of the water soaked sponge and thus maintains equilibrium in the setup. There is a<br>
pressure gauge attached to the air tubing so that the air pressure can be monitored and the<br>
appropriate amount of 'elastic' reaction can be given to the water-soaked sponge. Thus the<br>
setup is able to regulate the equivalent elasticity felt by the palpating hand. Fig. 3 shows the<br>
experimental validation system.<br>
Advantages :<br>
The tactile interface device is advantageous in teaching of medical students and such like<br>
applications where in they get more perception enhanced feel initially and as they get more<br>
skilled the level of help from the tactile interface decreases. The enhancement is perception is<br>
such that as if the nodule is larger and closer to palpating hand.<br>
In telemedicine applications where a robot or an unskilled person presses the sensor with<br>
uniform pressure on the body part under inspection. The expert sits in a different place and<br>
gets the perception of the nodule - if any are present in the said body part.<br>
This device is advantageous in applications where the surgeon or the examiner cannot touch<br>
the skin of the patient directly due to infectious diseases or some other reason. In such a case<br>
this interface could act as an ideal contraption, where the examiner still gets the feel without<br>
having to physically touch the patient's body. It is also important to note that wearing gloves<br>
or such protective gear prohibits any significant tactile feedback from reaching the examiner.<br>
