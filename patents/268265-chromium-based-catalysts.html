				<td>CHROMIUM-BASED CATALYSTS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a chromium-based catalyst for producing<br>
polyethylene and to a method for preparing polyethylene using a chromium-<br>
based catalyst. The present invention further relates to a product obtained<br>
with said catalyst.<br>
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
For polyethylene, and for high-density polyethylene (HDPE) in particular, the<br>
molecular weight distribution (MWD) is a fundamental property that partially<br>
determines the properties of the polymer, and thus its applications. It is<br>
generally recognised in the art that the molecular weight distribution of a<br>
polyethylene resin can determine the mechanical properties of the resin and<br>
that the provision of different molecular weight polyethylene molecules can<br>
significantly affect the rheological properties of the polyethylene as a whole.<br>
In this description, by polyethylene it is meant both homopolymers of<br>
ethylene and copolymers of ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer<br>
comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms. High-density polyethylene means<br>
polyethylene resins that have a density of about 0.941-0.965 g/cm3, and<br>
medium-density polyethylene means polyethylene resins that have a density<br>
of about 0.926-0.940 g/cm3. By polymerisation, it is meant both homo- and<br>
copolymerisation of ethylene.<br>
The molecular weight distribution can be defined by means of a curve<br>
obtained by gel permeation chromatography. Generally, the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD) is more simply defined by a parameter, known as the<br>
dispersion index D, which is the ratio between the average molecular weight<br>
by weight (Mw) and the average molecular weight by number (Mn). The<br>
dispersion index constitutes a measure of the width of the molecular weight<br>
distribution.<br><br>
Since an increase in the molecular weight normally improves some of the<br>
physical properties of polyethylene resins, there is a trend towards<br>
polyethylene having high molecular weight. High molecular weight molecules<br>
however render the polymer more difficult to process. On the other hand, a<br>
broadening in the molecular weight distribution tends to improve the flow of<br>
the polymer when it is being processed at high shear rates. Accordingly, in<br>
applications requiring a rapid transformation of the material through a die, for<br>
example in blowing and extrusion techniques, the broadening of the<br>
molecular weight distribution permits an improvement in the processing of<br>
polyethylene at high molecular weight (high molecular weight polyethylenes<br>
have a low melt index, as is known in the art). It is known that when the<br>
polyethylene has a high molecular weight and also a broad molecular weight<br>
distribution, the processing of the polyethylene is made easier as a result of<br>
the low molecular weight portion while the high molecular weight portion<br>
contributes to good mechanical properties for the polyethylene resin. A<br>
polyethylene of this type may be processed using less energy with higher<br>
processing yields.<br>
As a general rule, a polyethylene having a high density tends to have a high<br>
degree of stiffness. In general, however, the environmental stress crack<br>
resistance (ESCR) of polyethylene has an inverse relationship with stiffness.<br>
In other words, as the stiffness of polyethylene is increased, the<br>
environmental stress crack resistance is decreased, and vice versa. This<br>
inverse relationship is known in the art as the ESCR-rigidity balance. It is<br>
required, for certain applications, to achieve a compromise between the<br>
environmental stress crack resistance and the rigidity of the polyethylene.<br>
Polyethylene is well known in the art for use in making various finished<br>
goods, especially moulded products, such as bottles or containers.<br>
A variety of catalyst systems are known for the manufacture of polyethylene.<br>
It is known in the art that the mechanical properties of a polyethylene resin<br>
vary depending on what catalyst system was employed to produce the<br>
polyethylene. One of the reasons is that different catalyst systems tend to<br><br>
yield different molecular weight distributions in the polyethylene produced.<br>
Thus for example the properties of a polyethylene resin produced using a<br>
chromium oxide-based catalyst (i.e. a catalyst known in the art as a "Phillips-<br>
type catalyst") are different from the properties of a product employed using a<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst.<br>
While chromium-based catalysts have been known since the 1950's, different<br>
attempts have been made to improve them. In order to improve either the<br>
mechanical properties or the melt index of the polyethylene products, it has<br>
been proposed to add titanium as a promoter to a chromium-based catalyst.<br>
US 4,184,979 discloses that titanium can be incorporated into a catalytic<br>
composition by adding to a chromium-based catalyst, which has been heated<br>
in a dry inert gas, a titanium compound such as titanium tetraisopropoxide.<br>
The titanated catalyst is then activated at elevated temperature. The ethylene<br>
polymers obtained with this process do not however have satisfactory<br>
mechanical properties especially with regard to the environmental stress<br>
crack resistance (ESCR).<br>
In EP 882 743, a titanated catalyst providing polyethylene is obtained by<br>
providing a silica support having a specific surface area of at least 400 m2/g,<br>
depositing a chromium compound, dehydrating at a temperature of at least<br>
300°C in an atmosphere of dry inert gas, titanating the chromium-based<br>
catalyst at a temperature of at least 300°C in an atmosphere of dry and inert<br>
gas containing a titanium compound of the general formula selected from<br>
Ti(OR)4 to form a titanated chromium-based catalyst having a titanium<br>
content of from 1 to 5 wt-%, based on the weight of the titanated catalyst and<br>
activating the titanated catalyst at a temperature of from 500 to 900°C.<br>
Emphasis was put on the titanation procedure and on the use of a high<br>
surface area (of at least 400 m2/g). The exemplified chromium content of the<br>
catalyst was typically set at about 1 wt-%.<br>
Although EP 882 743 provides a catalyst to manufacture a resin with good<br>
ESCR and/or tear stress compared to other prior art documents, the use of<br><br>
said catalyst however leads to a rather low melt index potential, which results<br>
in reduced polymerisation unit operability, and sometimes limits the resin<br>
processability. In addition, if such a catalyst is operated in a gas phase<br>
process, where lower chromium content has to be used in order to avoid<br>
excessive reaction rates and run away during polymerisation, the problem is<br>
that the melt index is further reduced, down to an unacceptable level.<br>
There is therefore a need to further improve the catalyst operability while<br>
maintaining or improving the resin properties.<br>
The present invention aims at alleviating at least some of these drawbacks<br>
while still producing high or medium density polyethylene with good<br>
environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR), high impact resistance and<br>
good processability.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The applicants have found that at least some of these drawbacks can be<br>
alleviated by combining the use of a catalyst with relatively low specific<br>
surface area and chromium content, using titanation under specific conditions<br>
to attain a given support surface area/final titanium content ratio and using<br>
elevated activation temperatures.<br>
The present invention thus provides a process for preparing a supported<br>
chromium-based catalyst for the production of polyethylene comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
a)	providing a silica-based support having a specific surface area of at<br>
least 250 m2/g and of less than 400 m2/g and comprising a chromium<br>
compound deposited thereon, the ratio of the specific surface area of<br>
the support to chromium content being at least 50000 m2/g Cr;<br>
b)	dehydrating the product of step a)<br>
c)	titanating the product of step b) in an atmosphere of dry and inert gas<br>
containing at least one vaporised titanium compound of the general<br>
formula selected from RnTi(OR')m and (RO)nTi(OR')m, wherein R and<br><br>
R' are the same or different hydrocarbyl groups containing from 1 to<br>
12 carbon atoms, and wherein m is 1 to 4 and m+n equals 4, to form a<br>
titanated chromium-based catalyst having a ratio of specific surface<br>
area of the support to titanium content of the titanated catalyst ranging<br>
from 5000 to 20000 m2/g Ti.<br>
The present invention further provides a chromium-based catalyst for the<br>
production of polyethylene. Said catalyst is obtainable according to the<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
The present invention also provides a polymerisation process for preparing<br>
polyethylene by polymerising ethylene, or copolymerising ethylene and an<br>
alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms, in the presence<br>
of the chromium-based catalyst obtainable according to the process of the<br>
invention. The present invention also provides a polyethylene homopolymer<br>
or a copolymer of ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to<br>
10 carbon atoms, obtainable according to the polymerisation process of the<br>
present invention.<br>
The present invention further provides a use of the chromium-based catalyst<br>
obtainable from the process according to the present invention, for producing<br>
a polyethylene by polymerising ethylene, or copolymerising ethylene and an<br>
alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The<br>
polyethylene obtained has a high environmental stress crack resistance and<br>
a low melt fracture index.<br>
The present invention still further provides a use of a polyethylene<br>
homopolymer or a copolymer of ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer<br>
comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms, obtainable from the polymerisation process<br>
of the present invention for manufacturing moulded articles. These moulded<br>
articles have an increased impact resistance.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a supported<br>
chromium-based catalyst for the production of polyethylene comprising the<br>
steps described in claim 1.<br>
It has thus been found that the manufacturing process according to the<br>
present invention allows the preparation of a catalyst, which, when used in<br>
the polymerisation of ethylene, leads to a polyethylene having an unexpected<br>
combination of good properties, especially for blow moulding applications.<br>
Indeed, the inventors have found that, in the production of polyethylene<br>
resins, a particular chromium-based catalyst having a moderate specific<br>
surface area support, which has been dehydrated and the surface titanated<br>
prior to the activation of the catalyst at elevated temperatures, can<br>
unexpectedly yield polyethylene having high impact and/or environmental<br>
stress crack resistance.<br>
Suitable supports used in this invention are silica-based and comprise<br>
amorphous silica having a surface area of at least 250 m2/g, preferably of at<br>
least 280 m2/g, and less than 400 m2/g, preferably less than 380 m2/g and<br>
more preferably less than 350 m2/g, including said values. The specific<br>
surface area is measured by N2 adsorption using the well-known BET<br>
technique. In a previous application, EP 882 743, it had been assumed that a<br>
high surface area of at least 400 m2/g was a prerequisite for obtaining<br>
polyethylene with good properties.<br>
Silica-based supports comprise at least 50% by weight of amorphous silica.<br>
Preferably the support is a silica support or a silica alumina support. In the<br>
case of silica alumina supports, the support comprises at most 15% by<br>
weight of alumina.<br><br>
The support can have a pore volume of 1 cm2/g to 3 cm2/g. Supports with a<br>
pore volume of 1.3 - 2.0 cm3/g are preferred. Pore volume is measured by<br>
N2 desorption using the BJH method for pores with a diameter of less than<br>
1000A. Supports with too small a porosity result in a loss of melt index<br>
potential and in lower activity. Supports with a pore volume of over 2.5 cm3/g<br>
or even with a pore volume of over 2.0 cm3/g are less desirable because<br>
they require special expensive preparation steps (e.g. azeotropic drying)<br>
during their synthesis or subsequent modification with chromium compounds.<br>
In addition, because they are usually more sensitive to attrition during<br>
catalyst handling, activation or use in polymerisation, these supports often<br>
lead to more polymer fines production, which is detrimental in an industrial<br>
process.<br>
The silica-based support can be prepared by various known techniques such<br>
as but not limited to gelification, precipitation and/or spray-drying. Usually,<br>
particle size D50 is from 20 μm, preferably from 30 urn and more preferably<br>
from 35 μm, up to 150 urn, preferably up to 100 urn and most preferably up to<br>
70 μm. D50 is defined as a particle diameter, with 50 wt-% of particles having<br>
a smaller diameter and 50 wt-% of particles having a larger diameter. Particle<br>
size D90 is up to 200 μm, preferably up to 150 urn, most preferably up to 110<br>
μm. D90 is defined as a particle diameter, with 90 wt-% of particles having a<br>
smaller diameter and 10 wt-% of particles having a larger diameter. Particle<br>
size D10 is at least 5 μm, preferably at least 10 μm. D10 is defined as a<br>
particle diameter, with 10 wt-% of particles having a smaller diameter and 90<br>
wt-% of particles having a larger diameter. Particle size distribution is<br>
determined using light diffraction granulometry, for example, using the<br>
Malvern Mastersizer 2000. The particle morphology is preferably<br>
microspheroidal to favour fluidisation and to reduce attrition.<br>
Prior to use for catalyst synthesis, the support is dried by heating or pre-<br>
drying under an inert gas, in a manner known to those skilled in the art, e.g.<br>
at about 200°C for from 8 to 16 hours under nitrogen or other suitable gases.<br><br>
Known chromium-containing compounds capable of reacting with the surface<br>
hydroxyl groups of the silica-based supports can be used for deposition of<br>
chromium on said support. Examples of such compounds include chromium<br>
nitrate, chromium(lll)acefate, chromium(lll)acetylacetonate, chromium<br>
trioxide, chromate esters such as t-butyl chromate, silyl chromate esters and<br>
phosphorous-containing esters, and mixtures thereof. Preferably, chromium<br>
acetate, chromium acetylacetonate or chromium trioxide is used.<br>
The chromium content of the chromium-based catalyst is chosen to get a<br>
ratio of the specific surface area of the support to chromium content of at<br>
least 50000 m2/g chromium, preferably from 50000 or 55000 m2/g<br>
chromium, up to 75000, 100000 or 200000 m2/g chromium. Thus, there is at<br>
most 1 g of chromium per 50000 m2 of specific surface area of the support.<br>
The chromium-based catalyst can be prepared by dry mixing or non-aqueous<br>
impregnation but is preferably prepared by impregnation of silica with an<br>
aqueous solution of a soluble chromium compound such as chromium<br>
acetate, chromium acetylacetonate or chromium trioxide.<br>
After the chromium compound is deposited on the support, the chromium-<br>
based catalyst can be stored under a dry and inert atmosphere, for example,<br>
nitrogen, at ambient temperature.<br>
The supported chromium-based catalyst is subjected to a pre-treatment in<br>
order to dehydrate it and drive off physically adsorbed water from the silica or<br>
silica-based support. The removal of physically adsorbed water can help to<br>
avoid the formation of crystalline TiO2 as a product from the reaction of water<br>
with the titanium compound subsequently introduced during the titanation<br>
procedure, as described below. The dehydration step is preferably carried<br>
out by heating the catalyst to a temperature of at least 220°C, more<br>
preferably of at least 250°C and most preferably of at least 270°C, in a<br>
fluidised bed and in a dry inert atmosphere of, for example, nitrogen. The<br>
dehydration step is usually carried out for 0.5 to 2 hours.<br><br>
In a next step, the supported chromium-based catalyst is loaded with one or<br>
more titanium compounds. The titanium compounds may be of the formula<br>
RnTi(OR')m, (RO)n Ti(OR')m and mixtures thereof, wherein R and R' are the<br>
same or different hydrocarbyl groups containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms, and<br>
wherein m is 1, 2, 3 or 4 and m+n equals 4. Preferably, the titanium<br>
compounds are titanium tetraalkoxides Ti(OR')4 wherein each R' is the same<br>
or different and can be an alkyl or cycloalkyl group each having from 3 to 5<br>
carbon atoms. Mixtures of these compounds can also be used. The titanation<br>
is preferably performed by progressively introducing the titanium compound<br>
into a stream of a dry and inert non-oxidizing atmosphere, for example,<br>
nitrogen. The titanation step is carried out at a temperature so that titanium<br>
compound is present in its vaporised form. The temperature is maintained<br>
preferably at at least 220°C, more preferably at at least 250°C and most<br>
preferably at at least 270°C. The titanium compound can be pumped as a<br>
liquid into the reaction zone where it vaporizes.<br>
This titanation step is controlled so that the ratio of the specific surface area<br>
of the support to titanium content of the resultant catalyst is from 5000 to<br>
20000 m2/g Ti, and preferably from 5000, 6500, 7500 or 9000 m2/g Ti, up to<br>
12000, 15000 or 20000 m2/g Ti. Preferably, if the support has a specific<br>
surface area of from at least 250 m2/g and of less than 380 m2/g, the ratio of<br>
specific surface area of the support to titanium content of the titanated<br>
catalyst ranges from 5000 to 20000 m2/g Ti, and if the support has specific<br>
surface area of from at least 380 and of less than 400 m2/g, the ratio of<br>
specific surface area of the support to titanium content of the titanated<br>
catalyst ranges from 5000 to 8000 m2/g Ti. The total amount of titanium<br>
compound introduced into the gas stream is calculated in order to obtain the<br>
required titanium content in the resultant catalyst and the progressive flow<br>
rate of the titanium compound is adjusted in order to provide a titanation<br>
reaction period of 0.5 to 2 hours.<br><br>
After the introduction of the titanium compound, the catalyst can be flushed<br>
under a gas stream for a period of typically 0,75 to 2 hours. The dehydration<br>
and titanation steps are preferably performed in the vapour phase in a<br>
fluidised bed.<br>
After titanation the catalyst can be stored under a dry and inert atmosphere,<br>
for example, nitrogen, at ambient temperature.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the process further comprises<br>
a step d) consisting of activating the titanated product of step c). In order to<br>
activate the titanated catalyst, it must be subjected to dry air at an elevated<br>
activation temperature for at least 2 hours, preferably for at least 4 hours.<br>
The activation temperature can range from 500°C or 525 °C, up to 600°C,<br>
650°C, 700X, 750°C, 800°C or 850°C. The atmosphere is changed from the<br>
dry and inert atmosphere, such as nitrogen, to dry air, either progressively or<br>
instantly. If after the titanation step, the catalyst is not intended for storage,<br>
the temperature can be progressively increased from the titanation<br>
temperature to the activation temperature without intermediate cooling.<br>
The present invention also relates to an activated chromium-based catalyst<br>
for the production of polyethylene, comprising a silica-based support having a<br>
specific surface area of at least 250 m2/g and of less than 400 m2/g, a<br>
chromium compound deposited on the support, a ratio of the specific surface<br>
area of the support to chromium content of the catalyst of at least 50000<br>
m2/g, and a titanium compound deposited on the support to obtain a ratio of<br>
the specific surface area of the support to titanium content of the catalyst of<br>
5000 to 20000 m2/g Ti. Said activated catalyst is obtainable according to a<br>
process of the present invention.<br>
The details and embodiments mentioned above in connection with the<br>
process for manufacturing the catalyst also apply with respect to the<br>
activated catalyst according to the present invention.<br><br>
The invention yet further relates to a method for preparing polyethylene by<br>
polymerising ethylene, or copolymerising ethylene and an alpha-olefmic<br>
comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms, in the presence of an activated<br>
chromium-based catalyst comprising a silica-based support having a specific<br>
surface area of at least 250 m2/g and lower than 400 m2/g, a chromium<br>
compound deposited on the support, a ratio of the specific surface area of<br>
the support to chromium content of the catalyst of at least 50000 m2/g, and a<br>
titanium compound deposited on the support to obtain a ratio of the specific<br>
surface area of the support to the titanium content of the titanated catalyst of<br>
5000 to 20000 m2/g Ti, said activated catalyst being obtainable according to<br>
a process of the present invention.<br>
The details and embodiments mentioned above in connection with the<br>
process for manufacturing the catalyst also apply with respect to the<br>
polymerisation method according to the present invention.<br>
Compared to previous systems, the activated catalyst according to the<br>
present invention has an improved melt index potential for the resulting resin<br>
although the catalyst's activation temperature is kept below 700°C while at<br>
the same time retaining sufficient activity. This broadens the polymerisation<br>
conditions thus reducing constraints in the production process of<br>
polyethylene and keeping an acceptable melt index for processability.<br>
The ethylene polymerisation or copolymerisation method of the present<br>
invention is preferably carried out in the liquid phase (slurry process) or in the<br>
gas phase.<br>
In a liquid slurry process, the liquid comprises ethylene, and where required<br>
one or more alpha-olefinic comonomers comprising from 3 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, in an inert diluent. The comonomer may be selected from 1-butene, 1-<br>
hexene, 4-methyl 1-pentene, 1-heptene and 1-octene. The inert diluent is<br>
preferably isobutane. The polymerisation process is typically carried out at a<br>
polymerisation temperature of from 85 to 110°C and at a pressure of at least<br>
20 bars. Preferably, the temperature ranges from 95 to 110°C and the<br><br>
pressure is at least 40 bars, more preferably from 40 to 42 bars to produce<br>
polymer resins with high environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR).<br>
Other compounds such as a metal alkyl or hydrogen may be introduced into<br>
the polymerisation reaction to regulate activity and polymer properties such<br>
as melt flow index. In one preferred process of the present invention, the<br>
polymerisation or copolymerisation process is carried out in a liquid-full loop<br>
reactor.<br>
The method of the invention is particularly suited for gas phase<br>
polymerisations. Gas phase polymerisations can be performed in one or<br>
more fluidised bed or agitated bed reactors. The gas phase comprises<br>
ethylene, if required an alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon<br>
atoms, such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-octene or<br>
mixtures thereof and an inert gas such as nitrogen. Optionally a metal alkyl<br>
can also be injected in the polymerisation medium as well as one or more<br>
other reaction-controlling agents, for example, hydrogen. For medium and<br>
even lower density polyethylenes obtained in gas phase polymerisations, the<br>
lower the temperature within the reactor and the lower the ratio of the specific<br>
surface area to chromium content of the catalyst i.e. the higher the chromium<br>
content, the better the processability of the resin will be due to the presence<br>
of increased long chain branching. For medium and high density<br>
polyethylenes, the higher the temperature and the higher the ratio of the<br>
specific surface area to chromium content of the catalyst i.e. the lower the<br>
chromium content, the better the mechanical properties of the resin will be.<br>
Reactor temperature can be adjusted to a temperature of from 80, 85, 90 or<br>
95°C up to 100, 110, 112 or 115°C (Report 1: Technology and Economic<br>
Evaluation, Chem Systems, January 1998). Optionally a hydrocarbon diluent<br>
such as pentane, isopentane, hexane, isohexane, cyclohexane or mixtures<br>
thereof can be used if the gas phase unit is run in the so-called condensing<br>
or super-condensing mode.<br>
The activated and titanated chromium-based catalyst is introduced into the<br>
polymerisation reactor. The ethylene monomers, and comonomer if present,<br><br>
are fed into the polymerisation reactor. The polyethylene obtained with the<br>
catalyst of this invention has a broad molecular weight distribution (MWD)<br>
that is represented by the dispersion index D of typically from 12 to 23, more<br>
typically of 14 to 22 and a density typically from 0.930 or from 0.934 g/cm3,<br>
up to 0.960 g/cm3. Although the molecular weight distribution is very broad,<br>
the shear resistance (SR) is quite limited (SR is defined as HLMI/MI2 where<br>
HLMI is the high load melt index measured at 190°C and under a load of<br>
21.6 kg and MI2 is the melt index measured at 190°C under a load of 2.16<br>
kg, both with the ASTM D-1238 standard method). Nonetheless, the<br>
polyethylene exhibits good resistance to melt fracture when processed into<br>
bottles. The polyethylene obtained with the catalyst of this invention has high<br>
environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) and very high impact<br>
resistance.<br>
The invention also relates to an ethylene homopolymer or a copolymer of<br>
ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms,<br>
obtainable by polymerising ethylene, or copolymerising ethylene and an<br>
alpha-olefin comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms, in the presence of<br>
an activated catalyst according to the present invention. The polyethylene<br>
can be for example high density polyethylene or medium density<br>
polyethylene. According to a particular embodiment, the polyethylene is a<br>
semi high molecular weight polyethylene, i.e. with an HLMI ranging from 5 to<br>
12 g/10 min. The polyethylene of the present invention can also be a blow<br>
moulding grade with an HLMI of 15 to 30 g/10 min. The polyethylene can<br>
also be a grade for blown film, more specifically medium density film grade<br>
with a density of from 0.934 to 0.945 g/cm3.<br>
According to another embodiment, the polyethylene is a medium or low<br>
density resin obtained by polymerising ethylene in the presence of the<br>
activated catalyst of the invention in the gas phase. During polymerisation,<br>
the lower the ratio of specific surface area to chromium content of the<br>
catalyst and the lower the temperature in the gas phase reactor, the higher<br><br>
the degree of long chain branching will be. A polyethylene that is easily<br>
processable can thus be obtained.<br>
The present invention also relates to a use of an activated chromium-based<br>
catalyst according to the present invention, for producing a polyethylene<br>
having high environmental stress crack resistance and low melt fracture<br>
index, by polymerising ethylene, or copolymerising ethylene and an alpha-<br>
olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to 10 carbon atoms. The polyethylene<br>
produced according to the present invention thus has a high environmental<br>
stress crack resistance and a low incidence of melt fracture when melted and<br>
subjected to rotational shear at varying speeds. It is therefore especially<br>
suitable for use in blow moulded bottles or containers, as well as any other<br>
use where such properties are required or preferred.<br>
The details and embodiments mentioned above in connection with the homo<br>
and copolymers of ethylene also apply with respect to the use of the<br>
activated chromium-based catalyst obtainable according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention moreover relates to a use of ethylene homopolymer or<br>
a copolymer of ethylene and an alpha-olefinic comonomer comprising 3 to 10<br>
carbon atoms obtainable from the polymerisation process of the present<br>
invention for manufacturing moulded articles. In particular the ethylene<br>
homopolymer or copolymer can be used to manufacture blow moulded<br>
articles, films and pipes. By using the polyethylene of the present invention,<br>
the impact resistance of the moulded article is increased.<br>
The details and embodiments mentioned above in connection with the<br>
process for manufacturing the ethylene polymers also apply with respect to<br>
their uses according to the present invention.<br>
The following Examples are given to illustrate the invention without limiting its<br>
scope.<br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL PART<br>
Initial chromium-silica catalysts<br>
Catalyst A was obtained by deposition of about 0.51 wt-% chromium (Cr) on<br>
a microspheroidal silica support. The chromium source was Cr(lll)acetate.<br>
Impregnation with Cr-acetate was performed by incipient wetness<br>
impregnation, using an aqueous solution of the Cr-salt. This is typical of all<br>
the catalysts below.<br>
This catalyst was thus a Cr-silica catalyst. Main properties were: surface area<br>
(SA) = 306 m2/g, pore volume = 1.53 ml/g, Cr content = 0.51 wt-%. The ratio<br>
surface area/Cr = 60000 m2/g Cr.<br>
Catalyst B was similar to catalyst A, but its surface area was 315 m2/g, pore<br>
volume = 1.44 ml/g, Cr-content = 0.51 wt-%. The ratio surface area/Cr =<br>
61760 m2/g Cr.<br>
Catalyst C was again similar to catalyst A but its surface area was 301 m2/g,<br>
pore volume = 1.34 ml/g, Cr-content = 0.23 wt-%. The ratio surface area/Cr =<br>
130870 m2/g Cr.<br>
Catalyst D was a Cr-silica catalyst on a granular silica support. Its surface<br>
area was 319 m2/g, pore volume = 1.57 ml/g, Cr-content = 1.06 wt-%. The<br>
ratio surface area/Cr = 30000 m2/g Cr. The impregnation was carried out as<br>
explained for catalyst A.<br>
Catalyst E was similar to catalyst A, except that the silica support was<br>
characterised by a high surface area. The main properties were surface area<br>
= 461 m2/g, pore volume = 1.27 ml/g, Cr-content = 0.26 wt-%. The ratio<br>
surface area/Cr = 177310 m2/g Cr.<br><br>
Catalyst F was similar to catalyst D, but had a lower Cr loading. Surface area<br>
= 466 m2/g, pore volume =1.3 ml/g, Cr-content = 0.41 wt-%. The ratio<br>
surface area/Cr = 113660 m2/g Cr.<br>
Catalyst G was also similar to catalyst A, but from another batch. The surface<br>
area was 317 m2/g, pore volume = 1.46 ml/g, Cr-content = 0.53 wt-%. The<br>
ratio surface area/Cr = 59800 m2/g Cr.<br>
Catalyst H was similar to catalyst A, but from another batch. The surface<br>
area was 301 m2/g, pore volume = 1.53 ml/g, Cr-content = 0.56 wt-%. The<br>
ratio surface area/Cr = 53750 m2/g Cr. D50 = 46 μm, D10 = 13 urn, D90 =<br>
88 μm. Fines content (d 
Catalyst I was similar to catalyst A, but from another batch. The specific<br>
surface area was 319 m2/g and the Cr-content 0.55 wt-%. The ratio specific<br>
surface area/Cr was 58000 m2/g Cr.<br>
Catalyst J was similar to catalyst A, but from another batch. The specific<br>
surface area was 306 m2/g and the Cr-content 0.53 wt-%.<br>
Catalyst K was similar to catalyst A, but from another batch. The ratio specific<br>
surface area/Cr was 51300 m2/g Cr.<br>
Titanation of chromium-silica catalysts<br>
Labscale titanation and activation of chromium catalysts<br>
A series of titanated chromium-silica catalysts (Ti-Cr-Si-catalyst) were<br>
prepared using the chromium-silica materials described above and using the<br>
following procedure.<br>
The support impregnated with the chromium-compound was introduced in an<br>
activator vessel incorporating a fluidised bed, flushed under nitrogen and the<br><br>
temperature was raised from room temperature to 300°C. The dehydration<br>
step was carried out at this temperature for 2 hours. After this dehydration<br>
step, liquid titanium tetraisopropoxide (TYZOR® TPT), stored under<br>
anhydrous nitrogen, was progressively introduced in the lower part of the<br>
fluidised bed in the activator vessel maintained at 300°C so that titanium<br>
compound vaporised. The amount of titanium isopropoxide was calculated in<br>
order to get the required titanium content in the resultant catalyst. The flow<br>
thereof was adjusted to complete the addition in about 30 minutes. After the<br>
injection was completed, the catalyst was flushed with nitrogen for about 2<br>
hours. Nitrogen was then replaced by air and the temperature was raised to<br>
the desired activation temperature. In the activation step, the titanium<br>
containing catalyst was maintained at the desired activation temperature for 6<br>
hours. Then, the temperature was progressively decreased to 350°C. At<br>
350°C, the gas flow was switched to nitrogen for further cooling to room<br>
temperature. At room temperature, the catalyst was kept under dry inert<br>
atmosphere. Two small scale activators were used, one able to handle 1 kg<br>
of catalyst powder, and one able to handle 50 g of catalyst powder.<br>
Industrial scale titanation and activation of Cr-catalysts<br>
The starting catalyst was activated in an industrial fluidised bed activator<br>
according to the following procedure:<br>
-	about 200 kg of the starting solid was introduced in a fluidised bed<br>
activator;<br>
-	the starting solid was heated up to 120°C and then to 270°C in 3<br>
hours under nitrogen and maintained at this temperature for about 2<br>
hours;<br>
-	about 41 - 45 kg of titanium tetraisopropoxide (available under the<br>
trade name TYZOR® TPT) were progressively injected in the fluidised<br>
bed (over 2 hours whilst maintaining the temperature at 270°C so that<br>
titanium compound vaporised);<br>
-	the obtained titanated catalyst was further maintained at 270°C under<br>
nitrogen flow for 2 hours;<br><br>
-	nitrogen was replaced by air and the titanated catalyst was heated up<br>
to 550°C and maintained at 550°C for 6 hours;<br>
-	the activated catalyst was cooled down to 350°C under air and then to<br>
room temperature under nitrogen;<br>
-	the activated catalyst was unloaded under nitrogen and kept under<br>
inert atmosphere prior to further use in polymerisation.<br>
Bench scale polymerisations<br>
A series of polymerisation experiments were carried out in bench scale to<br>
evaluate the potential of the different catalysts.<br>
Testing was performed in suspension in isobutane, in slurry mode. The<br>
reactor was a 5-litre volume autoclave type with an agitator and a double<br>
wall. Hot water was passed through the double wall to control the internal<br>
temperature. The activated catalyst was introduced in the dry, clean<br>
autoclave, under nitrogen. 2 litres of liquid isobutane used as diluent was<br>
then introduced in the autoclave and the temperature was raised to the<br>
desired value. Gaseous ethylene (C2) was introduced into the reaction<br>
vessel. Ethylene pressure was adjusted to maintain a constant ethylene<br>
concentration in the liquid phase, typically 6 wt-%. Overall pressure was<br>
maintained constant by introducing fresh ethylene in the reactor. If required,<br>
1-hexene (C6) comonomer could be used to change the density of the<br>
polymer. One shot of 1-hexene was introduced at the start of the reaction. All<br>
the polymerisations were carried out under stirring to get a homogeneous<br>
mixing. After polymerisation was complete, the reactor was vented off and<br>
cooled down to room temperature. The powder was then dried in a vacuum<br>
oven to eliminate the residual monomers and isobutane prior to further<br>
processing (stabilization, extrusion, characterisation).<br>
Industrial scale polymerisation<br>
Industrial polymerisation trials were performed in a fluidised bed reactor. The<br>
polymerisation conditions are detailed in the corresponding examples.<br><br>
Characterisation of the polymers<br>
The polymers obtained in the Examples and Comparative examples were<br>
tested with different methods.<br>
The melt index of the polymers was measured according to the standard<br>
ASTM D 1238. MI2 corresponds to a measure at 190°C under a load of 2.16<br>
kg. HLMI corresponds to a measure at 190°C under a load of 21.6 kg and the<br>
results are given in g/10 minutes. Shear ratio SR2 was calculated as<br>
HLMI/MI2.<br>
The density was measured according to the standard ASTM D1505-85 and<br>
given in g/cm^.<br>
The number average molecular weight Mn, the weight average molecular<br>
weight Mw and the z-average molecular weight Mz were measured by gel<br>
permeation chromatography Waters S.A. GPC2000 gel permeation<br>
chromatograph. The chromatograph had been calibrated on a broad<br>
standard. Three columns were used, two Shodex AT-806MS columns from<br>
Showa Denko and one Styrogel HT6E column from Waters. The injection<br>
temperature was 145 °C, the injection volume comprised about 1000 ppm of<br>
stabiliser butylhydroxytoluene (BHT). The sample was prepared by mixing<br>
10-15 g of polyethylene with 10-15 ml of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB)<br>
comprising BHT during 1 hour at 155 °C. The mixture was filtered on a<br>
membrane of 0.50 μm and the concentration of the solution was 0.1 % in<br>
room temperature.<br>
The detector used was refractory indexer and the results were treated with<br>
the program Empower of Waters S.A. The results are given in kDa. The<br>
molecular weight distribution MWD, or more simply defined by a parameter<br>
known as the dispersion index D, was calculated as the ratio of Mw and Mn.<br>
A value of SR2/MWD is also given and it gives an estimation of the long<br>
chain branching (LCB), that is, a higher SR2/MWD corresponds to a higher<br>
long chain branching content.<br><br>
Environmental stress cracking resistance ESCR was measured according to<br>
the conditions described in the standard ASTM D 1693, conditions "B", as<br>
recommended for PE with densities higher than 0.925g/cm3. The ESCR tests<br>
are tests that are currently carried out in order to check the resistance of<br>
polyethylene to crack propagation when in contact with various chemical<br>
products.<br>
The conditions of test were chosen in order to accelerate the mechanism of<br>
crack propagation: the test was carried out at 50°C, the surfactant was Igepal<br>
CO 630, also named "Antarox", and the surfactant was used in pure form<br>
(100 %). The material to be tested was compression moulded into plates, out<br>
of which 10 specimens were punched out. The specimens were notched,<br>
bent and placed in contact with a surfactant at the test temperature. The test<br>
was therefore carried out at constant strain. The samples were visually<br>
checked twice a day to detect the appearance of any cracks on the<br>
specimens. When cracks had been detected on all specimens, the F50 time<br>
was calculated (time after which 50 % of the specimens are considered as<br>
"broken"). The results are thus given in hours.<br>
Melt fracture is a flow instability phenomenon occurring during extrusion of<br>
thermoplastic polymers at the fabrication surface/polymer melt boundary. The<br>
occurrence of melt fracture produces severe surface irregularities in the<br>
extrudate as it emerges from the orifice. The naked eye detects this surface<br>
roughness in the melt-fractured sample as a frosty appearance or matte<br>
finish as opposed to an extrudate without melt fracture that appears clear. In<br>
this description, melt fracture was estimated from Gottfert measurement of<br>
shear viscosity over a range of shear rates typical of those found in the<br>
process die.<br>
The measurements were carried out at a temperature of 210°C with a die 10<br>
mm in length and 1 mm in diameter. The shear rates were 750 s-1, 725 s-1,<br>
700 s-1, 650 s-1, 600 s-1, 500 s-1, 400 s-1 and 300 s-1. The evaluation of<br>
melt fracture was made visually.<br><br>
The Charpy impact resistance was determined according to the standard<br>
ASTM D-5045-91a. The method consisted in determining the resistance to<br>
impact by a V-shaped hammer (5.154 kg, Charpy ISO) falling on a<br>
normalised test specimen in normalised conditions, from a certain height.<br>
The test specimens were notched on Notchvis and with a razor blade a slight<br>
pressure was applied at the bottom of the notch in order to create the<br>
beginning of a fracture. The Charpy impact resistance was measured at two<br>
different temperatures, namely +23°C and -30°C. The results are given in<br>
average resilience (kJ/m2). The standard deviation (StdDev) of the resilience<br>
is also given.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Catalyst A was used for polymerisation of ethylene in bench scale. Titanation<br>
was performed in small scale as stated above (1 kg catalyst powder). Ti<br>
concentration was 2.8 wt-%. Final activation step was carried out at a<br>
temperature of 550°C. The activated catalyst was tested in a bench scale<br>
reactor as described above.<br>
The test conditions and the resin properties are presented in Table 1. Target<br>
productivity was 1000 g polymer/g catalyst. Runs 1A and 1B were conducted<br>
at 98°C and 102°C, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
In Example 2, two batches of activated catalyst A were prepared. Final Ti-<br>
concentration was 3.0 and 2.8 wt-%, respectively, and activation temperature<br>
was increased to 575°C and 600°C respectively. Activation was run in the<br>
same equipment as in Example 1. Polymerisation was performed under the<br>
same conditions as in Example 1, at a temperature of 98°C. The data is<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Example 3 was carried out using the same starting material as in Examples 1<br>
and 2. Activation was performed using the same activator as in Examples 1<br><br>
and 2. However, Ti content of the activated catalyst was raised to 3.7 and 3.8<br>
wt-%, respectively and activation temperature was set at 550°C and 600°C<br>
respectively.<br>
The polymerisation was performed under the same conditions as in<br>
Examples 1 and 2, the temperature being fixed at 98°C. The data is<br>
presented in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
Comments on data from Examples 1 to 3<br>
The results show that activation at a higher temperature results in higher catalyst<br>
activity, in higher resin melt index, but in slightly narrower MWD (from 23 (1A),<br>
19.5 (2A) and 17.6 (2B) respectively at 550, 575 and 600°C). However, for a given<br>
MI2, the shear response was slightly increased (see 1B and 2A). This could<br>
contribute to a higher content of long chain branching when the catalyst is<br>
activated at a higher temperature.<br>
Increasing the target Ti-concentration increases the melt index of the obtained<br>
polyethylene, while maintaining the MWD essentially constant (compare 2B and<br>
3B). However, at higher activation temperatures, this results in slightly lower<br>
ESCR, showing that the catalyst system is more sensitive to activation at higher<br>
Ti-contents.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Example 4 was carried out using catalyst B as the starting material. Catalyst B<br>
was activated in a small scale activator (50 mg catalyst powder), following the<br>
above general labscale procedure.<br>
Target titanium content of activated catalyst was 2.8 wt-%. Activation temperature<br>
was set at 550°C.<br>
Polymerisation was carried out in bench scale following the procedure described<br>
above. Target productivity was set at about 2000 g PE/g catalyst. Temperature<br>
was varied between 96 and 100°C at varying hexene concentrations to get<br>
different densities. The data is presented in Table 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Example 5 was carried out in a similar manner to Example 4, except that the<br>
activation temperature was set at 650°C. The data is presented in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Comments on data from Examples 4 and 5<br>
The data of Examples 4 and 5 show that an increase of activation temperature has<br>
a significant effect on the MWD and on the mechanical properties of the final PE<br>
resin. At 650°C, MWD is reduced from 15-20 to 12-14, while the ESCR of<br>
polyethylene with densities of 0.956-0.957 g/cm^ is divided by a number ranging<br>
from 2 to 3.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
A similar polymerisation was carried out using catalyst C (0.23 wt-% Cr) after<br>
titanation (3 wt-% Ti) and activation at 650°C (50 mg powder). The results are<br>
displayed in Table 3.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 7<br>
Comparative example 7 was carried out using catalyst D (nominal Cr-content: 1<br>
wt-%). Catalyst D was titanated (4 wt-% Ti) and further activated at 650°C in a<br>
small scale activator (50 mg catalyst). It was used for copolymerisation of ethylene<br>
with 1-hexene. The results are displayed in Table 3.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 8<br>
Catalyst D was activated in a small scale activator at 870°C without the titanation<br>
step. As such it was used for polymerisation of ethylene in a bench autoclave<br>
reactor. The data is presented in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
Comments on data from Example 6 and Comparative examples 7 and 8<br>
Table 3 compares the results obtained with different chromium loadings, including<br>
the results with 0.5 wt-% chromium (example 5B). The results show that<br>
increasing the chromium concentration to 1 wt-% results in lower mechanical<br>
properties. Indeed, although MWD is similar, final ESCR is lower (24 hours vs. 44<br>
and 54 hours). In addition, the shear ratio is higher for a similar MWD. Activation of<br>
Ti-free catalyst at a very high temperature is required to get a sufficient melt index<br>
potential that results in high shear response and a quite narrow MWD. This shows<br>
that the density of chromium sites on the surface is an important parameter and<br>
hence a higher surface area/g Cr is more favourable.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 9<br>
Catalyst E (SA = 461 m2/g, Cr = 0.26 wt-%) was titanated as described above (Ti<br>
= 5.15 wt-%) and activated at 550°C in a small scale activator (50 mg powder). It<br>
was used for a polymerisation trial in bench scale. The data is presented in Table<br>
4.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 10<br>
Catalyst F (SA = 466 m2/g, Cr = 0.41 wt-%,) was titanated and then activated at<br>
550°C in a small scale activator (50 mg powder). It was tested on bench scale for<br>
further evaluation. The data is presented in Table 4.<br><br><br>
Comments on results from Comparative examples 9 and 10<br>
Table 2, examples 4A-4D, provide results obtained with a low surface area<br>
catalyst titanated and activated at 550°C and table 4 provides results with high<br>
surface area catalyst titanated and activated at 550°C.<br>
The high surface area catalysts have a much lower melt index potential than the<br>
lower surface area catalysts as evidenced by the low melt index and/or the at least<br>
4°C higher polymerisation temperature required to get somewhat acceptable melt<br>
index potential. The high molecular weight of the polymers obtained results in a<br>
very good ESCR/density compromise. However, processing is significantly more<br><br>
difficult as shown by the very rapid onset of melt fracture observed when using<br>
polymers obtained with such catalysts.<br>
EXAMPLE 11<br>
Catalyst G was used in an industrial trial. Activation was carried out following the<br>
previous procedure described for large-scale activation. Titanium content was 3.1<br>
wt-% and activation temperature was set at 550°C.<br>
The titanated and activated catalyst was used in a gas phase fluidised bed reactor<br>
for co-polymerisation of ethylene and 1-hexene to produce HDPE. The throughput<br>
of the gas phase reactor was 25-30 t/hour PE.<br>
Polymerisation was carried out at a temperature of from 108 to 112°C. Ethylene<br>
partial pressure was about 16 bars. Hydrogen H2 (3 and 25 mol-%) was used to<br>
control the melt index of the final polyethylene. 1-hexene feed ratio of 0.038 to<br>
0.500 wt-% was used.<br>
Five lots of HDPE resins with HLMI ranging from 8.3 to 18.4 g/10 min were<br>
produced.<br>
The fluff was stabilized with antioxidants, 500 ppm lrgafos-168 and 500 ppm<br>
lrganox-1010 prior to extrusion and pelletisation.<br>
The products were characterised for catalyst productivity, flow properties (MI2 and<br>
HLMI), density and mechanical properties (ESCR and Charpy impact resistance).<br>
The reaction conditions and some properties of the resulting resins are presented<br>
in Table 5. Table 6 presents the ESCR and Charpy impact resistance behaviour<br>
as compared to similar commercial resins. Figures 1 and 2 show the ESCR-<br>
density compromise and the Charpy impact resistance of the resins according to<br>
the present invention vs. commercial Cr-catalysed HDPE materials. It is<br>
noteworthy that in Example 11, reactor conditions were very stable and reactor<br>
operability was very good, with e.g. very low electrostatic build up during the gas<br>
phase polymerisation.<br><br>
Figure 1 compares the ESCR-rigidity compromise of the experimental resins with<br>
commercial materials. In Figure 1, the density is given on the abscissa and the<br>
ESCR in hours on the ordinate. The upper curve shows the behaviour of second<br>
generation chromium grades, the lower curve shows the behaviour of first<br>
generation chromium grades and the triangles show the behaviour of the materials<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Commercial materials are divided between 1st generation HDPE resins and 2nd<br>
generation HDPE resins. First generation HDPE resins are known for very easy<br>
processability but limited mechanical properties. Representative materials are for<br>
instance former Finathene® 5502 and 47100 grades or 5502 grade presently sold<br>
by TOTAL Petrochemicals. Second generation HDPE resins are known for<br>
improved mechanical properties (i.e. a better density/rigidity - ESCR<br>
compromise). Typical resins include e.g. HDPE materials sold under the names<br>
53140, 53080 and 49080 (sold by TOTAL Petrochemicals), or sold under the<br>
names Stamylan ®8621 (SABIC) or Polimeri® BC86 (Polimeri Europa).<br>
Figure 1 shows that a catalyst according to the present invention is able to<br>
produce polymers having similar or better density-ESCR compromise than<br>
previously existing Cr-HDPE resins.<br>
Table 6 and Figure 2 compare the impact resistance of the experimental resins<br>
with those of commercial semi-high molecular weight materials. E1 stands for<br>
Example 11B, E2 for Example 11E and E3 for Example 11D. C1 stands for a<br>
commercial resin 2003SN53, C2 for a commercial resin 53140 and C3 for a<br>
commercial resin 53080, all sold by TOTAL Petrochemicals.<br>
The data shows that at low temperature, impact resistance is as good as that of<br>
the comparison materials with a lower density. At +23°C, the Charpy impact<br>
resistance of the experimental resins is significantly improved (+30 %).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Catalyst H was activated following the large scale activation procedure. Target<br>
titanium content was set at 4 wt-% and activation temperature at 650°C (surface<br>
area/titanium=7525 m2/g Ti). The activated catalyst was used for the production of<br>
a medium density film grade polyethylene. The polymerisation conditions are<br>
presented in Table 7.<br>
The obtained resin (d=0.944 g/cm3) was blown into a film.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
Catalyst I was titanated according to the industrial scale titanation procedure. The<br>
target titanium content was set to a target ratio of surface area/titanium of 5942<br>
m2/g Ti. The catalyst was activated at 620°C. The activated catalyst was used to<br>
polymerise ethylene on a large scale at conditions necessary to obtain a density of<br>
0.954 g/cm3 and an HLMI of 20 dg/min. The conditions and results are provided in<br>
Table 8.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 14<br>
Table 8 also provides a comparison of Example 13 presented as Comparative<br>
Example 14, which is a polyethylene prepared with a chromium catalyst having a<br>
specific surface area to chromium ratio of about 32600 m2/g Cr. The chromium<br>
catalyst was not titanated and activated at a temperature of 780°C.<br><br><br>
As it can be seen in the table above, the catalyst according to the invention<br>
provides a polyethylene with an environmental stress crack resistance almost 4<br>
times as long the catalyst according to the prior art.<br>
EXAMPLE 15 and 16<br>
Catalyst J was titanated according to the industrial scale titanation procedure. The<br>
target titanium content was set to a target ratio of surface area/titanium of 10200<br>
m2/g Ti. The catalyst was activated at 675 °C. The activated catalyst was used to<br>
polymerise ethylene on a large scale at conditions necessary to obtain a density of<br>
0.936 g/cm3 and an HLMI of 15 dg/min. The same activated catalyst J was used<br>
to polymerise ethylene on a large scale at conditions necessary to obtain a density<br>
of 0.928 g/cm3 and an HLMI of 14 dg/min. The conditions and results are provided<br>
in Table 9.<br><br>
The obtained resins were blown into a film.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 17<br>
Catalyst K was titanated according to the industrial scale titanation procedure. The<br>
specific surface area/chromium ratio comprises 51300 m2/g Cr, whereas the<br>
target titanium content was set to a target ratio of surface area/titanium of 6200<br>
m2/g Ti. The activated catalyst was used to polymerise ethylene on a large scale<br>
at conditions necessary to obtain a density of 0.919 g/cm3 and an HLMI of 18.9<br>
dg/min. The conditions and results are provided in Table 10.<br><br><br>
