				<td>THICKENED AQUEOUS COMPOSITION<br>
This invention relates to an aqueous composition containing rheology-modifying thickeners.<br>
Rheology modifiers are used in aqueous cleaning products, including for example, shampoo, to increase viscosity at low shear rates while maintaining flow properties of the product at higher shear rates. A variety of copolymer thickeners made from vinyl monomers have been used for this purpose. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,132,468 discloses a composition containing at least 18% surfactant, a lipophilically-modified acrylic copolymer and a clay. However, thickeners providing an optimum viscosity profile at low surfactant levels are greatly needed to provide thickening and suspending properties to a variety of other personal care products. Particularly desired is a large increase in low shear viscosity without substantial increase in high shear viscosity, accompanied by low turbidity.<br>
The problem addressed by the present invention is the need for rheology-modifying polymers providing optimum viscosity profiles in low-surfactant aqueous compositions.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an aqueous composition having less than 1 wt% surfactant comprising: (a) from 0.5-4 wt% of a first polymer comprising polymerized residues of: (i) from 5-30 wt% (meth)acrylate ester of a polyethylene glycol having 15 to 30 ethylene oxide residues and a C10-C22 alkyl group on one end; (ii) from 10-50% (meth)acrylic acid; and (iii) from 40-65 wt% C1-C8 alkyl (meth)acrylate; (b) from 0.05-1.5 wt% of a synthetic clay having an average particle size from 20-90 nm and a surface area from 120-500 m /g; and (c) from 0.3-5 wt% of a second polymer comprising polymerized residues of: (i) from 5-35 wt% C3-C6 carboxylic acid monomer; (ii) from 5-20 wt% C2-C3 hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylate; (iii) from 20-55 wt% C1-C4 alkyl methacrylate; and (iv) from 18-55 wt% C2-C4 alkyl acrylate; wherein the aqueous composition has a pH from 5 to 10.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Percentages are weight percentages (wt%) and temperatures are in 째C, unless specified otherwise. Viscosities were measured using an AR1000 rheometer from TA Instruments equipped with a 4째, 40 mm cone and operating at a temperature of approximately 20째C.<br>
Particle sizes are measures of the largest particle dimension, e.g., the diameter for disc-shaped particles. Values of pH are those measured at approximately 20째C.<br>
As used herein the term "(meth)acrylic" refers to acrylic or methacrylic, and "(meth)acrylate" refers to acrylate or methacrylate. "Acrylic monomers" include acrylic acid (AA), methacrylic acid (MAA), esters of AA and MAA, acrylamide (AM), methacrylamide (MAM), and derivatives of AM and MAM, e.g., octyl acrylamide (OAM). Esters of AA and MAA include, but are not limited to, alkyl, hydroxyalkyl and sulfoalkyl esters, e.g., methyl methacrylate (MMA), ethyl methacrylate (EMA), butyl methacrylate (BMA), hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), isobornyl methacrylate (IBOMA), methyl acrylate (MA), ethyl acrylate (EA), butyl acrylate (BA), and longer chain alkyl (meth)acrylates such as ethylhexyl acrylate (ERA), lauryl methacrylate (LMA), lauryl acrylate (LA), cetyl methacrylate (CEMA), and stearyl methacrylate (SMA). The term "(meth)acrylamide" refers to acrylamide (AM) or methacrylamide (MAM). Derivatives of (meth)acrylamide include, but are not limited to, alkyl- and sulfoalkyl-substituted (meth)acrylamides, e.g., N,N-dimethyl acrylamide, N,N-dipropyl acrylamide, t-butyl acrylamide, N-octyl acrylamide, 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid (AMPS), and longer chain alkyl (meth)acrylamides such as N-lauryl methacrylamide, N-stearyl methacrylamide.<br>
The term "vinyl monomers" refers to monomers that contain a carbon-carbon double bond that is connected to a heteroatom such as nitrogen or oxygen. Examples of vinyl monomers include, but are not limited to, vinyl acetate, vinyl formamide, vinyl acetamide, vinyl pyrrolidone, vinyl caprolactam, and long chain vinyl alkanoates such as vinyl neodecanoate, and vinyl stearate.<br>
The term "acrylic polymers" refers to polymers of acrylic monomers, and copolymers comprising at least 50% of acrylic monomers and (meth)acrylamide monomers.<br>
Preferably, acrylic polymers have at least 75% of monomer residues derived from (meth)acrylic acid or (meth)acrylate or (meth)acrylamide monomers, more preferably at least 85%, and most preferably at least 95%. Preferably, the remaining monomer units are derived from vinyl monomers, styrene or a-methylstyrene. The term "acrylamide polymers" refers to polymers of (meth)acrylamide monomers, and copolymers comprising at least 50% of (meth)acrylamide monomers. Preferably, acrylamide<br>
polymers have at least 70% of monomer residues derived from (meth)acrylamide monomers, and most preferably at least 85%.<br>
For purposes of this invention, alkyl groups are straight or branched chain alkyl groups or aralkyl or alkyl carbocyclic groups, such as alkylphenyl groups. It is understood that the alkyl groups may be either of synthetic or of natural origin and, in the latter case particularly, may contain a range of chain lengths. For example, naturally sourced stearic acid, even of commercially pure quality may contain only about 90% of stearic chains, up to about 7% of palmitic chains and a proportion of other chains and lower quality products may contain substantially less stearic acid. Polyethylene glycols also have a distribution of chain lengths having different numbers of polymerized ethylene oxide residues. It is intended herein that reference to the chain length of natural mixed alkyl groups is to the predominant chain length which is present as more than 50%, preferably in more than 75%, of the chains. In some embodiments of the invention, alkyl groups are straight or branched chain acyclic alkyl groups. Reference to the number of ethylene oxide residues in a polyethylene glycol is to the number of ethylene oxide residues corresponding to Mn of the polyethylene glycol.<br>
A (meth)acrylate ester of a polyethylene glycol having 15 to 30 ethylene oxide (EO) residues and a C10-C22 alkyl group on one end, in the first polymer of this invention, is a (meth)acrylate ester in which the group attached to the (meth)acryloyl group contains one hydroxyl group. Polyethylene glycols contain two hydroxyl groups, one on each end of the chain. The group attached to the (meth)acryloyl group in this invention is "capped" on one end with a C10-C22 alkyl group by formation of a C10-C22 alkyl ether. A general structure for<br>
this monomer would be: CH2=CR1CO2(CH2CH2O)nR , wherein R is hydrogen or methyl, n is 15-30 and R2 is a C10-C22 alkyl group, i.e., in the case of a methacryloyl ester, 20 EO residues and a C18 alkyl, a monomer structure would be: CH2=CHCO2(CH2CH2O)20C18H37. Of course other structures with different numbers of EO units, and possibly, different alkyl chain lengths, may also be present.

EXAMPLES<br>
Monomer percentages in polymers are calculated on the basis of total monoethylenically unsaturated monomers, excluding crosslinkers and chain transfer agents. Percentages of crosslinkers and chain transfer agents are calculated on the basis of total monoethylenically unsaturated monomers. Accordingly, those polymers including chain transfer agents and crosslinkers will have total percentages greater than 100%, but one can easily normalize the percentages to 100%. Low-shear (0.1-0.5 Pa) and high-shear (100-500 Pa) viscosities were measured at 0.1 Pa and 500 Pa, respectively, unless otherwise indicated, and the viscosities presented in Pas<br>
