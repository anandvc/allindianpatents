ANTIMALARIAL ACTIVITY<br>
The antimalarial activity of the test compounds was evaluated in rodent using multidrug<br>
resistant strain ofPlasmodium yoelii Nigeriensis in swiss mice.<br>
General Procedure: Random bred swiss mice of either sex (20±2gm) were inoculated<br>
intraperitoneally with IxlO5 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero. The treatment with test<br>
compounds were administered to group of 5 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 24-<br>
96 mg/kg/day. The treatment was administered via intramuscular route for 4 consecutive days (day<br>
0-3).<br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter<br>
at regular intervals till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was<br>
compared with the vehicle control group and the present suppression of parasitaemia in treated<br>
groups was calculated.<br>
For determining the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day<br>
28. The dose at which no parasitaemia develop during the observation period has been reported as<br>
the curative dose. The anti-malarial data is summarized in table 4.(Table Remove)<br><br><br><br><br>
