Description of The Preferred Embodiments<br>
The transport and storage container for liquids that is configured as a disposable or reusable container has as a main component an exchangeable parallelepipedal inner container 2 made of plastic material that is provided at the top wall with a filling spout 3 that can be closed by a lid 4 and a drainage spout 6 in the area of the bottom 7 for connecting a drainage fixture 8 thereto. The transport and storage container further comprises an outer jacket 9 comprised of crossing metal bars 10, 11 and a pallet-type support frame 12 having length and width measurements that conform to Euronorm standards. The support frame is designed for being manipulated by means of a forklift, a storage shelf operating device or similar transport means.<br>
The support frame 12 of the transport and storage container i is provided with a bottom 13 of sheet metal for supporting the inner container 2, The bottom 13 of the support frame 12 is positioned on four comer legs 14-17 and four central legs 18-21 made of sheet metal that are fastened to a steel pipe frame provided as a bottom frame<br>
22,<br><br>
Centrally underneath the bottom 13 of the support frame 12, a bridge-shaped reinforcement member 24 of sheet metal is attached like a girder by screws and extends transversely to the central axis 23-23 of the bottom. The central legs 19, 21 are formed as a unitary part of the member 24 at the two ends 24a, 24b.<br>
The bottom 7 of the inner container 2 is designed as a drainage bottom having a central flat drainage groove 25 that extends at a slight incline from the back wall 26 to the drainage spout 6 provided at the front wall 27 of the inner container 2. The bottom 13 of the support frame 12 matched to the bottom 7 of the inner container 2 drops from the longitudinal edges 28, 29 to the central axis 23-23 and from the rear edge 32 to the forward edge 31,<br>
The bottom 13 of the support frame 12 illustrated in Fig. 2 has at its underside 32 reinforcement corrugations 33, 34 extending in the direction of the central axis 23-23 and transversely thereto, wherein the bottom areas 35 of the grooves 33, 34 are located in a common horizontal plane so that the bottom 13 of the support frame 12 of the transport and storage container 1 rests horizontally on the gripping arms 36, 37 of a forklift or the shelf operating device that are moved underneath the bottom 13 of the support frame 12.<br>
At the underside 38a of the central groove-shaped recess 38 of the bottom 13 of the support frame 12, the reinforcement corrugations 34 provided on the bottom side 32, and the reinforcement member 24, anti-slip support elements 39 are provided with which the support frame bottom 13 during transport of a transport and storage container 1 by means of a forklift rests on the gripping arms (fork arms) 36, 37. The support elements 39 are flexible disks or plates 40 of plastic material or rubber that are glued to the bottom 13 of the support frame 12 and, for increasing the friction coefficient, can have a textured surface 4L<br><br>
Moreover, the support elements 39 of the support frame bottom 13 can be made of a fabric material.<br>
When having an appropriate thickness and material strength, the anti-slip support elements 39 configured as stiff disks or plates 40 can be screwed or riveted to the bottom 13 of the support frame 12.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a support frame 12 with a bottom 13 that is matched to the drainage bottom 7 of the inner container 2 of a transport and storage container 1. The bottom 13 is provided with support elements 39 in the form of wooden slats 42 that are fastened by securing mounts 43 welded to the bottom side 32 of the bottom 13. The wooden slats 42 serve as an anti-slip means for the support frame 12 during transport on the gripping arms 36, 37 of a transport device and for reinforcing the support frame bottom 13. In place of the wooden slats, it is also possible to employ plastic slats with a rough surface as a anti-slip support elements for the container support frame.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate an attachment of the wooden slats 42 on the bottom 13 of the support frame 12 by means of tubular rivets 44.<br>
The wooden slats 42 are aligned to a square shape concentrically to the central area 45 of the support frame bottom 13. In this way, it is ensured that the pallet- type support frame 12 of the transport and storage container 1 can be accessed from all four sides by the gripping arms 36, 37 of a transport device and, when the liquid container 1 is lifted by the transport device, the support frame bottom 13 rests with the wooden slats 42 on the gripping arms 36, 37 of the transport device.<br><br>
