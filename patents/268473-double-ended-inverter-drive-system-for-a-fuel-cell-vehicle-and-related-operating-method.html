				<td>DOUBLE-ENDED INVERTER DRIVE SYSTEM FOR A<br>
FUEL CELL VEHICLE AND RELATED OPERATING METHOD<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION(S)<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of United States provisional<br>
patent application serial number 60/952,745, filed July 30, 2007.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] Embodiments of the subject matter described herein relate<br>
generally to vehicle drive systems, and more particularly, embodiments of the<br>
subject matter relate to hybrid vehicles having a double-ended inverter drive<br>
system.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] In recent years, advances in technology, as well as ever evolving<br>
tastes in style, have led to substantial changes in the design of automobiles.<br>
One of the changes involves the power usage and complexity of the various<br>
electrical systems within automobiles, particularly alternative fuel vehicles,<br>
such as hybrid, electric, and fuel cell vehicles.<br>
[0004] Many of the electrical components, including the electric motors<br>
used in such vehicles, receive electrical power from alternating current (AC)<br>
power supplies. However, the power sources (e.g., batteries) used in such<br>
applications provide only direct current (DC) power. Thus, devices known as<br>
"power inverters" are used to convert the DC power to AC power, which often<br>
utilize several of switches, or transistors, operated at various intervals to<br>
convert the DC power to AC power.<br>
[0005] Additionally, such vehicles, particularly fuel cell vehicles, often<br>
use two separate voltage sources (e.g., a battery and a fuel cell) to power the<br>
electric motors that drive the wheels. "Power converters," such as direct<br><br>
current-to-direct current (DC/DC) converters, are typically used to manage<br>
and transfer the power from the two voltage sources. Modem DC/DC<br>
converters often include transistors electrically interconnected by an inductor.<br>
By controlling the states of the various transistors, a desired average current<br>
can be impressed through the inductor and thus control the power flow<br>
between the two voltage sources.<br>
[0006] The utilization of both a power inverter and a power converter<br>
greatly increases the complexity of the electrical system of the automobile.<br>
The additional components required for both types of devices also increase the<br>
overall cost and weight of the vehicle. Furthermore, most fuel cell vehicles<br>
and/or systems are designed to provide all of the traction power for vehicle<br>
operation from the fuel cell. This results in overdesign of the fuel cell stack<br>
because it must provide the peak power needed for the vehicle.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY<br>
[0007] An apparatus is provided for an electric drive system for a vehicle.<br>
The electric drive system comprises an electric motor configured to provide<br>
traction power to the vehicle. A first inverter is coupled to the electric motor,<br>
and is configured to provide alternating current to the electric motor. A fuel<br>
cell is coupled to the first inverter, wherein the first inverter is configured to<br>
provide power flow from the fuel cell to the electric motor. A second inverter<br>
is coupled to the electric motor, and is configured to provide alternating<br>
current to the electric motor. An energy source is coupled to the second<br>
inverter, wherein the second inverter is configured to provide power flow<br>
between the energy source and the electric motor. A controller is coupled to<br>
the first inverter and the second inverter, and is configured to provide a<br>
constant power from the fuel cell during operation of the electric motor.<br>
[0008] An apparatus is provided for an automotive drive system. The<br>
automotive drive system comprises an AC motor having an average required<br>
power during operation. A first inverter is coupled to the AC motor, and is<br>
configured to provide alternating current to the AC motor. A fuel cell is<br><br>
coupled to the first inverter, wherein the first inverter is configured to provide<br>
power flow from the fuel cell to the AC motor. A second inverter is coupled<br>
to the AC motor, and is configured to provide alternating current to the AC<br>
motor. An energy source is coupled to the second inverter, wherein the<br>
second inverter is configured to provide power flow between the energy<br>
source and the AC motor. A controller is coupled to the first inverter and the<br>
second inverter, and is configured to provide the average required power from<br>
the fuel cell to the AC motor.<br>
[0009] A method is provided for controlling an electric motor using a<br>
double-ended inverter system coupled to a fuel cell and an energy source. The<br>
method comprises providing a constant power to the electric motor from the<br>
fuel cell, wherein the fuel cell is configured such that the constant power<br>
corresponds to a fuel cell operating point having a peak efficiency. If the<br>
required power of the electric motor is greater than the constant power, the<br>
method further comprises providing power to the electric motor from the<br>
energy source. If the required power is less than the constant power, the<br>
method comprises charging the energy source using the fuel cell.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0016] The following detailed description is merely illustrative in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the embodiments of the subject matter or the<br>
application and uses of such embodiments. As used herein, the word<br>
"exemplary" means "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any<br>
implementation described herein as exemplary is not necessarily to be<br>
construed as preferred or advantageous over other implementations.<br>
Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or implied<br>
theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief summary<br>
or the following detailed description.<br>
[0017] The following description refers to elements or nodes or features<br>
being "connected" or "coupled" together. As used herein, unless expressly<br>
stated otherwise, "connected" means that one element/node/feature is directly<br>
joined to (or directly communicates with) another element/node/feature, and<br>
not necessarily mechanically. Likewise, unless expressly stated otherwise,<br>
"coupled" means that one element/node/feature is directly or indirectly joined<br>
to (or directly or indirectly communicates with) another element/node/feature,<br>
and not necessarily mechanically. Thus, although the schematics shown<br>
herein depict exemplary arrangements of elements, additional intervening<br>
elements, devices, features, or components may be present in an embodiment<br>
of the depicted subject matter. Furthermore, the terms "first", "second" and<br>
other such numerical terms referring to structures do not imply a sequence or<br>
order unless clearly indicated by the context.<br><br>
[0018] For the sake of brevity, conventional techniques related to<br>
signaling, sensors, and other functional aspects of the systems, (and the<br>
individual operating components of the systems) may not be described in<br>
detail herein. Furthermore, the connecting lines shown in the various figures<br>
contained herein are intended to represent exemplary functional relationships<br>
and/or physical couplings between the various elements. It should be noted<br>
that many alternative or additional functional relationships or physical<br>
connections may be present in an embodiment of the subject matter.<br>
[0019] Technologies and concepts discussed herein relate to optimizing<br>
the use of a fuel cell in a vehicle. The fuel cell may be selected to provide a<br>
constant power at a voltage level, where the fuel cell operates at or near a peak<br>
efficiency for the given voltage level. This avoids overdesign of the fuel cell<br>
and may improve efficiency and/or life of the fuel cell. A second energy<br>
source, such as a battery, may be used to provide any additional peak power<br>
the vehicle may require.<br>
[0020] Referring now to FIG. 1, a vehicle, or automobile 10, in<br>
accordance with one embodiment includes a chassis 12, a body 14, four<br>
wheels 16, and an electronic control system 18. The body 14 is arranged on<br>
the chassis 12 and substantially encloses the other components of the<br>
automobile 10. The body 14 and the chassis 12 may jointly form a frame.<br>
The wheels 16 are each rotationally coupled to the chassis 12 near a respective<br>
corner of the body 14.<br>
[0021] The automobile 10 may be any one of a number of different types<br>
of automobiles, such as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, or a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), and may be two-wheel drive (2WD) (i.e., rear-wheel<br>
drive or front-wheel drive), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive<br>
(AWD). The automobile 10 may also incorporate any one of, or combination<br>
of, a number of different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or<br>
diesel fueled combustion engine, a "flex fuel vehicle" (FFV) engine (i.e.,<br>
using a mixture of gasoline and alcohol), a gaseous compound (e.g., hydrogen<br><br>
and natural gas) fueled engine, a combustion/electric motor hybrid engine, and<br>
an electric motor.<br>
[0022] In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in FIG. 1, the automobile<br>
10 further includes a motor 20, a fuel cell module 22, an energy source 24, a<br>
power inverter assembly 26, and a radiator 28. As shown, the fuel cell module<br>
22 and the energy source 24 are in operable communication and/or electrically<br>
connected to the electronic control system 18 and the power inverter assembly<br>
26. During operation, the automobile 10 is operated by providing power to the<br>
wheels 16 with the motor 20 which receives power from the fuel cell module<br>
22 and the energy source 24.<br>
[0023] In an exemplary embodiment, the motor 20 is a tinulti-phase<br>
alternating current (AC) motor and includes a set of windings (or coils),<br>
wherein each winding corresponds to one phase of the motor 20. Although<br>
not illustrated, the motor 20 includes a stator assembly (including the coils), a<br>
rotor assembly (including a ferromagnetic core), and a cooling fluid (i.e.,<br>
coolant), as will be appreciated by one skilled in the art. The motor 20 may be<br>
an induction motor, a permanent magnet motor, or any type suitable for the<br>
desired application. As shown in FIG. 1, the motor 20 may also include a<br>
transmission integrated therein such that the motor 20 and the transmission are<br>
mechanically coupled to at least some of the wheels 16 through one or more<br>
drive shafts 30.<br>
[0024] In an exemplary embodiment, the radiator 28 is connected to the<br>
frame at an outer portion thereof and although not illustrated in detail, includes<br>
multiple cooling channels that contain a cooling fluid (i.e., coolant), such as<br>
water and/or ethylene glycol (i.e., "antifreeze"), and is coupled to the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 and the motor 20. In one embodiment, the power<br>
inverter assembly 26 receives and shares coolant with the motor 20. In<br>
alternative embodiments, the power inverter assembly 26 and/or motor 20 are<br>
air-cooled.<br>
[0025] In an exemplary embodiment, the electronic control system 18 is in<br>
operable communication with the motor 20, the fuel cell module 22, the<br><br>
energy source 24, and the power inverter assembly 26. Although not shown in<br>
detail, the electronic control system 18 may include various sensors and<br>
automotive control modules, or electronic control units (ECUs), such as an<br>
inverter control module, and a vehicle controller, and at least one processor<br>
and/or a memory which includes instructions stored thereon (or in another<br>
computer-readable medium) for carrying out the processes and methods as<br>
described below.<br>
[0026] Although not illustrated, the fuel cell module 22, in one<br>
embodiment, includes among other components, a fuel cell having an anode, a<br>
cathode, an electrolyte, and a catalyst. As is commonly understood, the anode,<br>
or negative electrode, conducts electrons that are freed from, for example,<br>
hydrogen molecules so that they can be used in an external circuit. The<br>
cathode, or positive electrode, conducts the electrons back from the external<br>
circuit to the catalyst, where they can recombine with the hydrogen ions and<br>
oxygen to form water. The electrolyte, or proton exchange membrane,<br>
conducts only positively charged ions while blocking electrons, while the<br>
catalyst facilitates the reaction of oxygen and hydrogen. Depending on the<br>
embodiment, various combinations electrolytes, fuels, and oxidants may be<br>
used, and it will be appreciated in the art that the subject matter discussed<br>
herein applies to any type of fuel cell module 22.<br>
[0027] In an exemplary embodiment, the fuel cell module 22 may<br>
comprise a fuel cell stack or a module formed by combining individual fuel<br>
cells in series (e.g., to achieve a higher voltage level) and/or parallel (e.g., to<br>
achieve a higher current). In an exemplary embodiment, the fuel cell module<br>
22 has a peak efficiency or optimum operating point (or range) for the current<br>
(e.g., power) provided by the fuel cell module 22 based on the voltage level of<br>
the individual fuel cell(s) comprising the fuel cell module 22, as described<br>
below. A peak efficiency or optimum operating point corresponds to power<br>
output (current output for the given voltage level) where the ratio of electrical<br>
energy output to the input energy is at a maximum for the voltage level, as will<br>
be appreciated in the art.<br><br>
[0028] Referring now to FIG. 2, in an exemplary embodiment, the fue! cell<br>
module 22 comprises a stack of individual feel celts, wherein each individual<br>
fuel cell may be characterized by an operating polarization curve similar to the<br>
one shown in FIG. 2. As shown, fee voltage of the fuel cell VFC varies with<br>
respect to the current being provided by the fuel cell, which results in a power<br>
output, P0UT. During operation, the fuel cell potential (VFC) is decreased from<br>
its maximum theoretical or equilibrium potential (VEQ) because of irreversible<br>
losses (PLOSS)- In an exemplary embodiment, the loss (PLOSS) is non-linear at<br>
currents below a first current (/,) and currents above a second current (I2).<br>
At currents below I1 the fuel ceil experiences activation polarization losses,<br>
and at currents above I2 the fuel cell experiences concentration polarization<br>
losses, as will be appreciated in the art. However, as shown, the toss PLOSS is<br>
relatively linear (e.g., ohmic losses) over the current range bounded by /, and<br>
I2. In an exemplary embodiment, the fuel cell efficiency (e.g., ratio of POUT<br>
to PLOSS) is greatest over the relatively linear region between I1 and I2. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the fuel cell module 22 is designed such that the fuel<br>
cell(s) comprising the fuel cell module 22 operates between I1 and I2. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the fuel cell stack may be designed such<br>
that during operation each fuel cell voltage level corresponds to the linear<br>
region (e.g., V2 ≤ VFC ≤ V1) as described below.<br>
[0029] Referring again to FIG. 1, depending on the embodiment, the<br>
energy source 24 may comprise a battery, another fuel cell, an ultracapacitor,<br>
or another suitable voltage source. The battery may be any type of battery<br>
suitable for use in a desired application, such as a lead acid battery, a lithium-<br>
ion battery, a nickel-metal battery, or another rechargeable battery. In an<br>
exemplary embodiment, the power inverter assembly 26 is configured to<br>
provide power to/from the motor 20, the fuel cell module 22, and the energy<br>
source 24, as discussed in greater detail below.<br><br>
[0030] Referring now to FIG. 3, a double-ended inverter system 32 may<br>
be adapted to drive the motor 20 in accordance with one embodiment. The<br>
double-ended inverter system 32 includes the motor 20, the fuel cell module<br>
22, the energy source 24, the power inverter assembly 26, and a controller 34.<br>
In order to power the motor 20, DC power is provided from the fuel cell<br>
module 22 and the energy source 24 to the power inverter assembly 26, which<br>
converts the DC power into AC power provided to the motor windings 36<br>
based on the speed, commanded torque (i.e., commanded synchronous frame<br>
currents), and other motor parameters, as is commonly understood in the art.<br>
[0031] Referring again to FIG. 2, the inverter assembly 26 includes a first<br>
inverter 38 and a second inverter 40, each including six switches (e.g.,<br>
semiconductor devices, such as transistors and/or switches) with antiparallel<br>
diodes (i.e., antiparallel to each switch). As shown, the switches in the<br>
sections 38 and 40 are arranged into three pairs (or legs), with pairs 42, 44,<br>
and 46 being in the first inverter 38 and pairs 48, 50, and 52 being in the<br>
second inverter 40. In an exemplary embodiment, the windings 36 of the<br>
motor 20 are electrically coupled, at opposing ends thereof, between the<br>
switches of switch pairs 42, 44, 46 in the first inverter 38 and the switch pairs<br>
48, 50, 52 in the second inverter 40 as shown. The double-ended inverter<br>
system 32 may also include first and second capacitors 54 and 56, respectively<br>
connected in parallel with the fuel cell module 22 and the energy source 24, to<br>
smooth current ripple during operation.<br>
[0032] Still referring to FIG. 3, the controller 34 is in operable<br>
communication and/or electrically connected to the first and second inverters<br>
38 and 40. The controller 34 is responsive to commands received from the<br>
driver of the automobile 10 (e.g., via an accelerator pedal or the electronic<br>
control system 18). In an exemplary embodiment, the controller 34 is<br>
configured to modulate and control the inverters 38, 40 using high frequency<br>
pulse width modulation (PWM), as will be understood. The controller 34<br>
provides a control algorithm that achieves desired power flow between the<br>
fuel cell module 22 and the energy source 24 while producing the commanded<br><br>
torque inside the motor 20. Many combinations of voltage across the<br>
windings 36 may produce the commanded torque in the motor 20 and achieve<br>
desired power flow between the fuel cell module 22, the energy source 24, and<br>
the motor 20. The controller 34 provides PWM signals to operate (i.e.,<br>
modulate) the switches within the first and second inverters 38 and 40 to cause<br>
the desired output voltages to be applied across the windings 36 to operate the<br>
motor 20 with the required torque, as will be appreciated in the art.<br>
[0033] Referring again to FIG. 2 and 3, in an exemplary embodiment, the<br>
double-ended inverter system 32 is configured and/or designed to maximize<br>
the efficiency (i.e., the ratio of electrical energy output to the input energy) of<br>
the fuel cell module 22 and minimize the stress on the fuel cell module 22<br>
imposed by the system. As described above, the efficiency of the fuel cell<br>
module 22 depends on the amount of power and/or current provided by (or<br>
drawn from) it. In an exemplary embodiment, the fuel cell module 22 (e.g.,<br>
the fuel cell stack) may be designed for a voltage level and current output that<br>
corresponds to an optimum efficiency for the fuel cell module 22. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the motor 20 (or vehicle) has an average<br>
required power (based on the torque commands) during operation. The fuel<br>
cell module 22 may be designed such that when the fuel cell module 22 is<br>
producing the average required power (or current), the operating point is<br>
within the optimum efficiency range and the fuel cell(s) comprising the fuel<br>
cell module 22 have a voltage (VFC) between V1, and V2 during operation. In<br>
accordance with one embodiment, the double-ended inverter system 32 is<br>
configured to operate the fuel cell module 22 at a peak efficiency or optimum<br>
operating point by providing continuous and/or constant power (e.g., current)<br>
to the motor 20 from the fuel cell module 22 during operation of the motor 20<br>
that corresponds to a peak efficiency for the fuel cell(s).<br>
[0034] In an exemplary embodiment, the energy source 24 is designed to<br>
provide any peak power required by the motor 20 (e.g., power that exceeds the<br>
power provided by the fuel cell module 22) and operate efficiently in<br>
conjunction with the fuel cell module 22. For example, if the motor 20 (or<br><br>
vehicle) has a maximum required power during operation, the energy source<br>
24 should be capable of providing the difference between the maximum<br>
required power and the power provided by the fuel cell module 22 to the<br>
motor 20. The energy source 24 may be selected or designed such that the<br>
efficiency of the energy source 24 is maximized or optimized for providing<br>
power values ranging from zero to the peak power required by the motor 20.<br>
For example, in the case where the energy source 24 is a battery, the voltage<br>
level or the chemical composition and/or type of the battery may be selected<br>
for most efficient operation.<br>
[0035] Referring now to FIG. 4, in an exemplary embodiment, a double-<br>
ended inverter system 32 may be configured to perform a motor control<br>
process 400 and additional tasks, functions, and operations described below.<br>
The various tasks may be performed by software, hardware, firmware, or any<br>
combination thereof. For illustrative purposes, the following description may<br>
refer to elements mentioned above in connection with FIGS. 1-3. In practice,<br>
the tasks, functions, and operations may be performed by different elements of<br>
the described system, such as the controller 34 or the electronic control system<br>
18. It should be appreciated any number of additional or alternative tasks may<br>
be included, and may be incorporated into a more comprehensive procedure or<br>
process having additional functionality not described in detail herein.<br>
[0036] Referring again to FIG. 4, and with continued reference to FIGS. 1-<br>
3, the motor control process 400 may be initiated in response to a signal or<br>
command from a vehicle control module (e.g., an electronic control unit or<br>
ECU) or upon startup of a vehicle. In an exemplary embodiment, the motor<br>
control process 400 may determine a continuous and/or constant power (or<br>
current) to be provided by the fuel cell module (task 402). In accordance with<br>
one embodiment, the continuous and/or constant power is the average power<br>
required by the motor and/or vehicle. Based on the power to be provided, the<br>
desired current and corresponding voltage level for the fuel cell module is<br>
selected that corresponds to a peak efficiency point when providing the<br>
continuous and/or constant power (i.e., current) (task 404). It should be<br><br>
understood that the peak efficiency point (or optimum operating range) for a<br>
fuel cell module may vary based upon the chemical composition (e.g., fuel cell<br>
type or type of electrolytes), efficiency characteristics of the fuel cell(s), and<br>
the number of fuel cells in the fuel cell stack. The motor control process 400<br>
is configured to provide the continuous power from the fuel cell module to the<br>
motor (task 406). For example, the controller may modulate the inverters to<br>
cause the constant power to flow from the fuel cell module to the motor.<br>
[0037] In an exemplary embodiment, the motor control process 400 is<br>
configured to modulate the inverters to provide power to/from the motor and<br>
another energy source based upon the real-time road conditions (task 408).<br>
For example, in a situation where the motor and/or vehicle requires more<br>
power than the fuel cell module is configured to provide (i.e., the continuous<br>
and/or constant power), the inverters may be modulated to provide additional<br>
or peak power from the energy source. Alternatively, if the motor and/or<br>
vehicle requires less power than the fuel cell module is providing, the inverters<br>
may be modulated to charge the energy source using the excess power<br>
provided by the fuel cell module. In an exemplary embodiment, the inverters<br>
are modulated such that the inverter 38 coupled to the fuel cell module 22<br>
operates at a unity power factor with respect to the current in the motor 20.<br>
When the inverter 38 is operating at unity power factor, the inverter 38 is able<br>
to supply the motor 20 with the highest possible output voltage when the fuel<br>
cell module 22 is providing all of the power being consumed by the motor 20<br>
(e.g., the motor requires power less than or equal to the average power). The<br>
second inverter 40 may provide any reactive power consumed by the motor<br>
20. This type of operation represents a maximum sustainable continuous load<br>
condition and minimizes the required current rating of the double-ended<br>
inverter system32. This improves overall system efficiency, since resistive<br>
losses increase proportionally with an increasing current. It should be<br>
appreciated that the first inverter 32 is not required to operate at unity power<br>
factor under all conditions, however, doing so allows for a higher system<br>
voltage when the fuel cell module is providing power.<br><br>
[0038] The systems and/or methods described above provide a way to<br>
improve the operating efficiency of fuel cell vehicles by operating the fuel cell<br>
at a peak efficiency point, and using the double-ended inverter system to<br>
provide additional power from another energy source as needed by road<br>
conditions. The fuel cell stack may be designed and/or sized to provide a<br>
constant and/or continuous power at a peak efficiency point. Similarly, the<br>
other energy source may also be selected or designed for improved efficiency.<br>
[0039) Other features of a double-ended inverter system, such as various<br>
power flows or power transfer, may also be achieved. The fuel cell and the<br>
energy source can share the peak motor load without additional power<br>
electronics. As described above, the performance of the motor is not impaired<br>
and the commanded torque may still be generated within the motor, while<br>
allowing excess power to charge the energy source.<br>
[0040] Other embodiments may utilize system and method described<br>
above in different types of automobiles, different vehicles (e.g., watercraft and<br>
aircraft), or in different electrical systems altogether, as it may be<br>
implemented in any situation where fuel cells are used as part of an electric<br>
drive system. Further, the motor and the inverters may have different numbers<br>
of phases, and the systems described herein should not be construed as limited<br>
to a three-phase design. The basic principles discussed herein may be<br>
extended to higher-order phase systems as will be understood in the art. Other<br>
forms of energy sources may be used, such as current sources and loads<br>
including diode rectifiers, thyristor converters, fuel cells, inductors, capacitors,<br>
and/or any combination thereof.<br>
[0041] While at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast number<br>
of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary<br>
embodiment or embodiments described herein are not intended to limit the<br>
scope, applicability, or configuration of the claimed subject matter in any way.<br>
Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art<br>
with a convenient road map for implementing the described embodiment or<br><br>
embodiments. It should be understood that various changes can be made in<br>
the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the scope<br>
defined by the claims, which includes known equivalents and foreseeable<br>
equivalents at the time of filing this patent application.<br><br>
