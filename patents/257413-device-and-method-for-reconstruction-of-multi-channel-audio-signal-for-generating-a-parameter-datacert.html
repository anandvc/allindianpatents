				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to parametric multi-channel<br>
processing techniques and, in particular, to<br>
encoders/decoders for generating and/or reading a flexible<br>
data syntax and for associating parameter data with the<br>
data of the downmix and/or transmission channels.<br>
In addition to the two stereo channels, a recommended<br>
multi-channel surround representation includes a center<br>
channel C and two surround channels, i.e. the left surround<br>
channel Ls and the right surround channel Rs, and<br>
additionally, if applicable, a subwoofer channel also<br>
referred to as LFE channel (LFE = Low Frequency<br>
Enhancement). This reference sound format is also referred<br>
to as 3/2 (plus LFE) stereo and recently also as 5.1 multi-<br>
channel, which means that there are three front channels<br>
and two surround channels. In general, five or six<br>
transmission channels are required. In a reproduction<br>
environment, at least five loudspeakers are required in the<br>
respective five different positions to obtain an optimal<br>
so-called sweet spot a determined distance from the five<br>
correctly placed loudspeakers. However, with respect to its<br>
positioning, the subwoofer is usable in a relatively free<br>
way.<br>
There are several techniques for reducing the amount of<br>
data required to transmit a multi-channel audio signal.<br>
Such techniques are also called joint stereo techniques.<br>
For this purpose, reference is made to Fig. 5. Fig. 5 shows<br>
a joint stereo device 60. This device may be a device<br>
implementing, for example, the intensity stereo technique<br>
(IS technique) or the binaural cue coding technique (BCC<br>
technique). Such a device generally receives at least two<br><br>
channels (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) as input signal and outputs at<br>
least one single carrier channel (downmix) and parametric<br>
data, i.e. one or more parameter sets. The parametric data<br>
are defined so that an approximation of each original<br>
channel (CH1, CH2, ... CHn) may be calculated in a decoder.<br>
Normally, the carrier channel will include subband samples,<br>
spectral coefficients or time domain samples, etc., which<br>
provide a comparatively fine representation of the<br>
underlying signal, while the parametric data and/or<br>
parameter sets do not include any such samples or spectral<br>
coefficients. Instead, the parametric data include control<br>
parameters for controlling a determined reconstruction<br>
algorithm, such as weighting by multiplication, time<br>
shifting, frequency shifting, .... The parametric data thus<br>
include only a comparatively rough representation of the<br>
signal or the associated channel. Expressed in numbers, the<br>
amount of data required by a carrier channel (which is<br>
compressed, i.e. coded by means of AAC, for example) is in<br>
the range of 60 to 70 kbit/s, while the amount of data<br>
required by parametric side information is in the order<br>
from 1.5 kbit/s for a channel. One example for parametric<br>
data are the known scaling factors, intensity stereo<br>
information or binaural cue parameters, as will be<br>
described below.<br>
The intensity stereo coding technique is described in the<br>
AES preprint 3799 entitled "Intensity stereo coding" J.<br>
Herre, K. H. Brandenburg, D. Lederer, February 1994,<br>
Amsterdam. In general, the concept of intensity stereo is<br>
based on a main axis transform which is to be applied to<br>
data of the two stereophonic audio channels. If most data<br>
points are placed around the first main axis, a coding gain<br>
may be achieved by rotating both signals by a determined<br>
angle prior to the coding. However, this does not always<br>
apply to real stereophonic reproduction techniques. The<br>
reconstructed signals for the left and right channels<br>
consist of differently weighted or scaled versions of the<br><br>
same transmitted signal. Nevertheless, the reconstructed<br>
signals differ in amplitude, but they are identical with<br>
respect to their phase information. The energy time<br>
envelopes of both original audio channels, however, are<br>
maintained by means of the selective scaling operation<br>
typically operating in frequency-selective fashion. This<br>
corresponds to the human sound perception at high<br>
frequencies where the dominant spatial cues are determined<br>
by the energy envelopes.<br>
In addition, in practical implementations the transmitted<br>
signal, i.e. the carrier channel, is formed of the sum<br>
signal of the left channel and the right channel instead of<br>
rotating both components. Furthermore, this processing,<br>
i.e. the generation of the intensity stereo parameters for<br>
performing the scaling operation, is performed in a<br>
frequency-selective way, i.e. independently of each other<br>
for each scale factor band, i.e. for each encoder frequency<br>
partition. Preferably, both channels are combined to form a<br>
combined or "carrier" channel. In addition to the combined<br>
channel, the intensity stereo information is determined<br>
which depends on the energy of the first channel, the<br>
energy of the second channel and the energy of the combined<br>
or sum channel.<br>
The BCC technique is described in the AES convention paper<br>
5574 entitled "Binaural cue coding applied to stereo and<br>
multi-channel audio compression", C. Faller, F. Baumgarte,<br>
May 2002, Miinchen. In BCC coding, a number of audio input<br>
channels is converted to a spectral representation using a<br>
DFT-based transform with overlapping windows. The resulting<br>
spectrum is divided into non-overlapping partitions. Each<br>
partition has a bandwidth proportional to an equivalent<br>
right-angled bandwidth (ERB). So-called inter-channel level<br>
differences (ICLD) as well as so-called inter-channel time<br>
differences (ICTD) are calculated for each partition, i.e.<br>
for each band and for each frame k, i.e. a block of time<br>
samples. The ICLD and ICDT parameters are quantized and<br><br>
coded to obtain a BCC bit stream. The inter-channel level<br>
differences and the inter-channel time differences are<br>
given for each channel with respect to a reference channel.<br>
In particular, the parameters are calculated according to<br>
predetermined formulae depending on the particular<br>
divisions of the signal to be processed.<br>
On the decoder side, the decoder receives a mono signal and<br>
the BCC bit stream, i.e. a first parameter set for the<br>
inter-channel time differences and a second parameter set<br>
for the inter-channel level differences per frame. The mono<br>
signal is transformed to the frequency domain and input<br>
into a synthesis block also receiving decoded ICLD and ICTD<br>
values. In the synthesis block or reconstruction block, the<br>
BCC parameters (ICLD and ICTD) are used to perform a<br>
weighting operation of the mono signal to reconstruct the<br>
multi-channel signal, which then, after a frequency/time<br>
conversion, represents a reconstruction of the original<br>
multi-channel audio signal.<br>
In the case of BCC, the joint stereo module 60 operates to<br>
output the channel side information so that the parametric<br>
channel data are quantized and coded ICLD and ICTD<br>
parameters, wherein one of the original channels may be<br>
used as reference channel for coding the channel side<br>
information. Normally, the carrier channel is formed of the<br>
sum of the participating original channels.<br>
Of course, the above technique only provides a mono<br>
representation for a decoder which is only able to decode<br>
the carrier channel, but which is not capable of generating<br>
the parameter data for generating one or more<br>
approximations of more than one input channel.<br>
The audio coding technique referred to as BCC technique is<br>
further described in the US patent applications US<br>
2003/0219130 Al, 2003/0026441 Al and 2003/0035553 Al. In<br>

Schemes and Applications", C. Faller and F. Baumgarte,<br>

Channel Audio compression", Preprint, 112th Convention of<br>

Spenger „MP3 Surround: Efficient and Compatible Coding of<br>
Multi-Channel Audio", 116th AES Convention, Berlin, 2004,<br>
Preprint 6049. In the following, there will be represented<br>
a typical general BCC scheme for multi-channel audio coding<br>
in more detail with respect to Figs. 6 to 8. Fig. 6 shows a<br>
general BCC coding scheme for coding/transmission of multi-<br>
channel audio signals. The multi-channel audio input signal<br>
is input at an input 110 of a BCC encoder 112 and is "mixed<br>
down" in a so-called downmix block 114, i.e. converted to a<br>
single sum channel. In the present example, the signal at<br>
the input 110 is a 5-channel surround signal having a front<br>
left channel and a front right channel, a left surround<br>
channel and a right surround channel, and a center channel.<br>
Typically, the downmix block generates a sum signal by<br>
simple addition of these five channels into a mono signal.<br>
Other downmix schemes are known in the art, all resulting<br>
in generating, using a multi-channel input signal, a<br>
downmix signal having a single channel or having a number<br>
of downmix channels which, in any case, is less than the<br>
number of original input channels. In the present example,<br>
a downmix operation would already be achieved if four<br>
carrier channels were generated from the five input<br>
channels. The single output channel and/or the number of<br>
output channels is output on a sum signal line 115.<br>
Side information obtained by a BCC analysis block 116 are<br>
output on a side information line 117. In the BCC analysis<br>
block, inter-channel level differences (ICLD), inter-<br>
channel time differences (ICTD) or inter-channel<br>
correlation values (ICC values) may be calculated. Thus,<br>
there are three different parameter sets, namely the inter-<br><br>
channel level differences (ICLD), the inter-channel time<br>
differences (ICTD) and the inter-channel correlation values<br>
(ICC) , for the reconstruction in the BCC synthesis block<br>
122.<br>
The sum signal and the side information with the parameter<br>
sets are typically transmitted to a BCC decoder 120 in a<br>
quantized and coded format. The BCC decoder splits the<br>
transmitted (and decoded, in the case of a coded<br>
transmission) sum signal into a number of subbands and<br>
performs scalings, delays and further processing to<br>
generate the subbands of the several channels to be<br>
reconstructed. This processing is performed so that the<br>
ICLD, ICTD and ICC parameters (cues) of a reconstructed<br>
multi-channel signal at output 121 are similar to the<br>
respective cues for the original multi-channel signal at<br>
input 110 into the BCC encoder 112. For this purpose, the<br>
BCC decoder 120 includes a BCC synthesis block 122 and a<br>
side information processing block 123.<br>
The following will illustrate the internal structure of the<br>
BCC synthesis block 122 with respect to Fig. 7. The sum<br>
signal on the line 115 is input into a time/frequency<br>
conversion block typically embodied as filter bank FB 125.<br>
At the output of block 125, there is a number N of subband<br>
signals or, in an extreme case, a block of spectral<br>
coefficients, if the audio filter bank 125 performs a<br>
transform generating N spectral coefficients from N time<br>
domain samples.<br>
The BCC synthesis block 122 further includes a delay stage<br>
126, a level modification stage 127, a correlation<br>
processing stage 128 and a stage IFB 129 representing an<br>
inverse filter bank. At the output of the stage 12 9, the<br>
reconstructed multi-channel audio signal having, for<br>
example, five channels in the case of a 5-channel surround<br>
system may be output on a set of loudspeakers 124, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 6.<br><br>
Fig. 7 further illustrates that the input signal s (n) is<br>
converted to the frequency domain or filter bank domain by<br>
means of element 125. The signal output by element 125 is<br>
multiplied so that several versions of the same signal are<br>
obtained, as indicated by node 130. The number of versions<br>
of the original signal is equal to the number of output<br>
channels in the output signal to be reconstructed. If each<br>
version of the original signal is subjected to a determined<br>
delay di, d2, ... di, dN at the node 130, the result is the<br>
situation at the output of blocks 126, which includes the<br>
versions of the same signal, but with different delays. The<br>
delay parameters are calculated by the side information<br>
processing block 123 in Fig. 6 and derived from the inter-<br>
channel time differences as they were determined by the BCC<br>
analysis block 116.<br>
The same applies to the multiplication parameters ai, a2 ...<br>
ai, aN, which are also calculated by the side information<br>
processing block 123 based on the inter-channel level<br>
differences determined by the BCC analysis block 116.<br>
The ICC parameters are calculated by the BCC analysis block<br>
116 and used for controlling the functionality of the block<br>
128 so that determined correlation values between the<br>
delayed and level-manipulated signals are obtained at the<br>
output of block 128. It is to be noted that the order of<br>
the stages 126, 127, 128 may be different from that<br>
represented in Fig. 7.<br>
It is further to be noted that, in a blockwise processing<br>
of the audio signal, the BCC analysis is also performed<br>
blockwise. Furthermore, the BCC analysis is also performed<br>
frequency-wise, i.e. in a frequency-selective way. This<br>
means that, for each spectral band, there is an ICLD<br>
parameter, an ICTD parameter and an ICC parameter for each<br>
block. The ICTD parameters for at least one block for at<br>
least one channel across all bands' thus represent the ICTD<br><br>
parameter set. The same applies to the ICLD parameter set<br>
representing all ICLD parameters for at least one block for<br>
all frequency bands for the reconstruction of at least one<br>
output channel. The same applies, in turn, to the ICC<br>
parameter set which again includes several individual ICC<br>
parameters for at least one block for various bands for the<br>
reconstruction of at least one output channel on the basis<br>
of the input channel or sum channel.<br>
In the following, reference is made to Fig. 8 showing a<br>
situation from which the determination of BCC parameters<br>
may be seen. Normally, the ICLD, ICTD and ICC parameters<br>
may be defined between any channel pairs. Typically a<br>
determination of the ICLD and the ICTD parameters is<br>
performed between a reference channel and each other input<br>
channel, so that there is a distinct parameter set for each<br>
of the input channels except the reference channel. This is<br>
also illustrated in Fig. 8A.<br>
However, the ICC parameters may be defined differently. In<br>
general, ICC parameters may be generated in the encoder<br>
between any channel pairs, as also illustrated<br>
schematically in Fig. 8B. In this case, a decoder would<br>
perform an ICC synthesis so that approximately the same<br>
result is obtained as it was present in the original signal<br>
between any channel pairs. However, there has been the<br>
suggestion to calculate only ICC parameters between the two<br>
strongest channels at any time, i.e. for each time frame.<br>
This scheme is represented in Fig. 8C, which shows an<br>
example in which, at one time, an ICC parameter between the<br>
channels 1 and 2 is calculated and transmitted, and in<br>
which, at another time, an ICC parameter between the<br>
channels 1 and 5 is calculated. The decoder then<br>
synthesizes the inter-channel correlation between the two<br>
strongest channels in the decoder and executes further<br>
typically heuristic rules for synthesizing the inter-<br>
channel coherence for the remaining channel pairs.<br><br>
With respect to the calculation of, for example, the<br>
multiplication parameters ai, ... aN based on the transmitted<br>
ICLD parameters, reference is made to the cited AES<br>
convention paper 5574. The ICLD parameters represent an<br>
energy distribution in an original multi-channel signal.<br>
Without loss of generality, Fig. 8A shows that there are<br>
four ICLD parameters representing the energy difference<br>
between all other channels and the front left channel. In<br>
the side information processing block 123, the<br>
multiplication parameters ai, ... aN are derived from the<br>
ICLD parameters so that the total energy of all<br>
reconstructed output channels is the same energy as present<br>
for the transmitted sum signal or is at least proportional<br>
to this energy. One way to determine these parameters is a<br>
two-stage process in which, in a first stage, the<br>
multiplication factor for the left front channel is set to<br>
1, while multiplication factors for the other channels in<br>
Fig. 8C are set to the transmitted ICLD values. Then, in a<br>
second stage, the energy of all five channels is calculated<br>
and compared to the energy of the transmitted sum signal.<br>
Then, all channels are downscaled, namely using a scaling<br>
factor which is equal for all channels, wherein the scaling<br>
factor is selected so that the total energy of all<br>
reconstructed output channels after the scaling is equal to<br>
the total energy of the transmitted sum signal and/or the<br>
transmitted sum signals.<br>
With respect to the inter-channel coherence measure ICC<br>
transmitted from the BCC encoder to the BCC decoder as<br>
further parameter set, it is to be noted that a coherence<br>
manipulation could be performed by modification of the<br>
multiplication factors, such as by multiplying the<br>
weighting factors of all subbands by random numbers having<br>
values between 201ogl0"6 and 201ogl06. The pseudo random<br>
sequence is typically selected so that the variance for all<br>
critical bands is approximately equal and that the average<br>
value within each critical band is zero. The same sequence<br>
is used for the spectral coefficients of each different<br><br>
frame or block. Thus, the width of the audio scene is<br>
controlled by modifications of the variances of the pseudo<br>
random sequence. A larger variance generates a larger<br>
hearing width. The variance modification may be performed<br>
in individual bands having a width of a critical band. This<br>
allows the simultaneous existence of several objects in a<br>
hearing scene, wherein each object has a different hearing<br>
width. A suitable amplitude distribution for the pseudo<br>
random sequence is a uniform distribution on a logarithmic<br>
scale, such as represented in the US patent publication<br>
2002/0219130 Al.<br>
In order to transmit the five channels in a compatible way,<br>
for example in a bit stream format which is also suitable<br>
for a normal stereo decoder, there may be used the so-<br>
called matrixing technique described in "MUSICAM Surround:<br>
A universal multi-channel coding system compatible with<br>
ISO/IEC 11172-3", G. Theile and G. Stoll, AES Preprint,<br>
October 1992, San Francisco.<br>
Furthermore, see further multi-channel coding techniques<br>
described in the publication "Improved MPEG 2 Audio multi-<br>
channel encoding", B. Grill, J. Herre, K. H. Brandenburg,<br>
E. Eberlein, J. Roller, J. Miller, AES Preprint 3865,<br>
February 1994, Amsterdam, wherein a compatibility matrix is<br>
used to obtain the downmix channels from the original input<br>
channels.<br>
In summary, you can say that the BCC technique allows an<br>
efficient and also backward-compatible coding of multi-<br>
channel audio material, as also described, for example, in<br>
the specialist publication by E. Schuijer, J. Breebaart, H.<br>
Purnhagen, J. Engdegard entitled "Low-Complexity Parametric<br>
Stereo Coding", 119th AES Convention, Berlin, 2004,<br>
Preprint 6073. In this context, mention should also be made<br>
of the MPEG-4 standard and particularly the expansion to<br>
parametric audio techniques, wherein this standard part is<br>
also known by the designation ISO/IEC 14496-3: 2001/FDAM 2<br><br>
(Parametric Audio). In this respect, there should be<br>
mentioned, in particular, the syntax in table 8.9 of the<br>
MPEG-4 standard entitled "syntax of the ps.data()". In this<br>
example, we should mention the syntax elements "enable_icc"<br>
and "enable_ipdopd", wherein these syntax elements are used<br>
to turn on and off a transmission of an ICC parameter and a<br>
phase corresponding to inter-channel time differences.<br>
There should further be mentioned the syntax elements<br>
"icc_data()" "ipd_data()" and "opd_data()".<br>
In summary, it is to be noted that generally such<br>
parametric multi-channel techniques are used employing one<br>
or several transmitted carrier channels, wherein M<br>
transmitted channels are formed from N original channels to<br>
reconstruct again the N output channels or a number K of<br>
output channels, wherein K is equal to or less than the<br>
number of original channels N.<br>
As can be seen from Fig. 6, the BCC analysis is a typical<br>
separate preprocessing to generate parameter data on the<br>
one hand and one or more transmission channels (downmix<br>
channels) on the other hand from a multi-channel signal<br>
having N original channels. Typically, these downmix<br>
channels are then compressed for example by means of a<br>
typical MP3 or AAC stereo/mono encoder, although this is<br>
not shown in Fig. 6, so that, on the output side, there is<br>
a bit stream representing the transmission channel data in<br>
compressed form and that there is further another bit<br>
stream representing the parameter data. The BCC analysis<br>
thus occurs separately from the actual audio coding of the<br>
downmix channels and/or the sum signal 115 of Fig. 6.<br>
The decoder side is similar. A decoder having multi-channel<br>
ability will first decode the bit stream including the<br>
compressed downmix signal depending on the used coding<br>
algorithm and again provide one or more transmission<br>
channels on the output side, i.e. typically as a time<br>
sequence of PCM data (PCM = Pulse Code Modulation) . Then,<br><br>
the BCC synthesis will take place as a distinct separate<br>
and isolated postprocessing which signals self-sufficiently<br>
with the parameter data stream and is provided with data to<br>
generate, on the output side, several output channels<br>
preferably equal to the number of the original input<br>
channels from the audio-decoded downmix signal.<br>
Thus, it is an advantage of the BCC analysis that it has a<br>
distinct filter bank for the purposes of the BCC analysis<br>
and a distinct filter bank for the purposes of the BCC<br>
synthesis, for example, so that it is separate from the<br>
filter bank of the audio encoder/decoder in order not to<br>
have to make any compromises regarding audio compression on<br>
the one hand and multi-channel reconstruction on the other<br>
hand. Generally speaking, the audio compression is thus<br>
done separately from the multi-channel parameter processing<br>
to be optimally equipped for both fields of application.<br>
However, this concept has the disadvantage that a complete<br>
signaling has to be transmitted both for the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction and for the audio decoding. This is<br>
particularly disadvantageous when, as will typically be the<br>
case, both the audio decoder and the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means perform the same or similar steps and<br>
thus require the same and/or mutually dependent<br>
configuration settings. Due to the completely separate<br>
concept, signaling data are thus transmitted twice<br>
resulting in an artificial "expansion" of the data amount,<br>
which is ultimately due to the fact that one has chosen the<br>
separate concept between audio coding/decoding and multi-<br>
channel analysis/synthesis.<br>
On the other hand, a complete "linking" of the multi-<br>
channel reconstruction to the audio decoding would<br>
considerably restrict the flexibility, because in that case<br>
the actually important goal of the separation of both<br>
processing steps to be able to perform each processing step<br>
in an optimal way would have to be given up. Thus,<br><br>
considerable quality losses would arise, in particular in<br>
the case of several successive coding/decoding stages also<br>
referred to as "tandem" coding. If there is a complete<br>
linking of the BCC data to the coded audio data, a multi-<br>
channel reconstruction has to be performed with each<br>
decoding to perform a multi-channel synthesis again when<br>
recoding. Since it is the nature of every parametric<br>
technique that it is lossy, losses will accumulate by<br>
repeated analysis synthesis analysis so that, with each<br>
encoder/decoder stage, the perceptible quality of the audio<br>
signal further decreases.<br>
In this case, decoding/encoding of audio data without<br>
simultaneous analysis/synthesis processing of the parameter<br>
data would only be possible if each audio codec in the<br>
tandem chain worked identically, i.e. had the same sampling<br>
rate, block length, advance length, windowing, transform,<br>
..., i.e. had generally the same configuration, and if, in<br>
addition, the respective block boundaries also were<br>
maintained. Such a concept, however, would considerably<br>
restrict the flexibility of the whole concept. Particularly<br>
regarding the fact that the parametric multi-channel<br>
techniques are intended to supplement already existing<br>
stereo data, for example, by additional parameter data,<br>
this limitation is all the more painful. Since the already<br>
existing stereo data may originate from many different<br>
encoders that all use different block lengths or that do<br>
not even operate in the frequency domain, but in the time<br>
domain etc., such a limitation would take the concept of<br>
the later supplementation ad absurdum from the beginning.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to provide a<br>
flexible and efficient concept for generating a multi-<br>
channel audio signal or a reconstruction parameter data<br>
set.<br>
This object is achieved by a device for generating a multi-<br>
channel signal according to claim 1, a method for<br><br>
generating a multi-channel signal according to claim 14, a<br>
device for generating a parameter data set according to<br>
claim 15, a method for generating a parameter data output<br>
according to claim 18, a device for generating a parameter<br>
data output according to claim 19, a method for generating<br>
a parameter data output according to claim 20, or a<br>
computer program according to claim 21.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that<br>
efficiency on the one hand and flexibility on the other<br>
hand may be achieved by having the data stream, which can<br>
include transmission channel data and parameter data,<br>
contain a parameter configuration cue that has been<br>
inserted on the encoder side and is evaluated on the<br>
decoder side. This cue indicates whether a multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means is configured from the input data,<br>
i.e. from the data transmitted from the encoder to the<br>
decoder, or whether a multi-channel reconstruction means is<br>
configured by a cue to a coding algorithm with which coded<br>
transmission channel data have been decoded. The multi-<br>
channel reconstruction means has a configuration setting<br>
identical to a configuration setting of the audio decoder<br>
for decoding the coded transmission channel data or at<br>
least dependent on this setting.<br>
If a decoder detects the first situation, i.e. the<br>
parameter configuration cue has a first meaning, the<br>
decoder will look for further configuration information in<br>
the received input data, to properly configure the multi-<br>
channel reconstruction means, to use the information then<br>
to effect a configuration setting of the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means. Such a configuration setting could<br>
be, for example, block length, advance, sampling frequency,<br>
filter bank control data, so-called granule information<br>
(how many BCC blocks there are in a frame), channel<br>
configurations (e.g. a 5.1. output is generated whenever<br>
there is "mp3"), information on which parameter data are<br><br>
obligatory in a scaled case (e.g. ICLD) and which are not<br>
(ICTD), etc.<br>
If, however, the decoder determines that the parameter<br>
configuration cue has a second meaning different from the<br>
first meaning, the multi-channel reconstruction means will<br>
choose the configuration setting in the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means depending on information about the<br>
audio coding algorithm on which the coding/decoding of the<br>
transmission channel data, i.e. the downmix channels, is<br>
based.<br>
In contrast to the separate concept of the parameter data<br>
on the one hand and the compressed downmix data on the<br>
other hand, the inventive device for generating a multi-<br>
channel audio signal commits a "theft", so to speak, for<br>
the configuration of the multi-channel reconstruction<br>
means, in the actually completely separate and self-<br>
sufficient audio data and/or in an upstream audio decoder<br>
operating self-sufficiently, to configure itself.<br>
The inventive concept is particularly powerful in a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present • invention when<br>
different audio coding algorithms are considered. In this<br>
case, a large amount of explicit signaling information<br>
would have to be transmitted for achieving a synchronous<br>
operation, i.e. an operation in which the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means operates synchronously with the audio<br>
decoder, namely the corresponding advance lengths, etc. for<br>
each different coding algorithm, so that the actually<br>
independent multi-channel reconstruction algorithm runs<br>
synchronously with the audio decoding algorithm.<br>
According to the invention, the parameter configuration<br>
cue, for which a single bit is sufficient, signals to a<br>
decoder that, for the purpose of its configuration, it is<br>
to look which audio encoder it is downstream to. Following<br>
this, the decoder will receive information on which audio<br><br>
encoder is currently upstream to a number of different<br>
audio encoders. When it has received this information, it<br>
will preferably enter a configuration table deposited in<br>
the multi-channel decoder with this audio coding algorithm<br>
identification to there retrieve the configuration<br>
information predefined for each of the possible audio<br>
coding algorithms to effect at least one configuration<br>
setting of the multi-channel reconstruction means. This<br>
achieves a significant data rate saving as compared to the<br>
case in which the configuration is explicitly signaled in<br>
the data stream, in which there is thus no consideration<br>
between the multi-channel reconstruction means and the<br>
audio decoder, and in which there is no inventive "theft"<br>
of audio decoder data by the multi-channel reconstruction<br>
means either.<br>
On the other hand, the inventive concept still provides the<br>
high flexibility inherent to the explicit signaling of<br>
configuration information, because, due to the parameter<br>
configuration cue, for which a single bit in the data<br>
stream is sufficient, there is the possibility to actually<br>
transmit all configuration information in the data stream,<br>
if needed, or - as a mixed form - to transmit at least part<br>
of the parameter configuration information in the data<br>
stream and to take another part of necessary information<br>
from a set of laid down information.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
data transmitted from the encoder to the decoder further<br>
include a continuation cue signaling to a decoder whether<br>
it should change configuration settings at all in<br>
comparison to already existing or previously signaled<br>
configuration settings, or whether it should continue as<br>
before, or whether, as a reaction to a certain setting of<br>
the continuation cue, the parameter configuration cue is<br>
read in to determine whether there should be an alignment<br>
of the multi-channel reconstruction means with respect to<br>
the audio decoder, or whether at least partially explicit<br><br>
information regarding the configuration are contained in<br>
the transmission data.<br>

for the calculation of the parameter sets ICLD,<br>
ICTD and ICC.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a block circuit diagram of an inventive device<br>
for generating a parameter data set, wherein the parameter<br>
data set may be output at an output 10 of the device shown<br>
in Fig. 1. The parameter data set contains parameter data<br>
which, together with transmission channel data not<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1, but which will be discussed later,<br>
represent N original channels, wherein the transmission<br>
channel data will typically include M transmission<br>
channels, wherein the number M of transmission channels is<br>
smaller than the number N of original channels and is equal<br>
to or larger than 1.<br>
The device shown in Fig. 1, which will be accommodated on<br>
the encoder side, includes multi-channel parameter means 11<br>
designed to perform, for example, a BCC analysis or an<br>
intensity stereo analysis or the like. In this case, the<br>
multi-channel parameter means 11 will receive N original<br>
channels at an input 12. Alternatively, however, the multi-<br>
channel parameter means 11 may also be designed as<br>
transcoder means to generate the parameter data at the<br>
output of means 11 using existing raw parameter data fed<br>
into a raw parameter input 13. If the parameter data are<br>
simple BCC data as they are provided by any BCC analysis<br>
means, the processing of the multi-channel parameter means<br>
11 will simply consist in a copying function of the data<br>
from the input 13 into an output of means 11. However, the<br>
multi-channel parameter means 11 may also be designed to<br>
change the syntax of the raw parameter data stream to add,<br>
for example, signaling data or to write parameter sets that<br>
may be decoded or skipped at least partially independent of<br>
each other from the existing raw parameter data.<br><br>
The device shown in Fig. 1 further includes signaling means<br>
14 for determining and associating a parameter<br>
configuration cue PKH with the parameter data at the output<br>
of means 11. In particular, the signaling means is designed<br>
to determine the parameter configuration cue such that it<br>
has a first meaning when configuration information<br>
contained in the parameter data set are to be used for a<br>
multi-channel reconstruction. Alternatively, the signaling<br>
means 14 will determine the parameter configuration cue<br>
such that it has a second meaning when configuration data<br>
that are based on a coding algorithm that is to be used<br>
and/or has been used for coding the transmission channel<br>
data are to be used for a multi-channel reconstruction.<br>
Finally, the inventive device of Fig. 1 includes<br>
configuration data writing means 15 designed to associate<br>
configuration information with the parameter data and the<br>
parameter configuration cue to finally obtain the parameter<br>
data set at output 10. The parameter data set 10 thus<br>
includes the parameter data from the multi-channel<br>
parameter means 11, the parameter configuration cue PKH<br>
from the signaling means 14 and, if applicable,<br>
configuration data from the configuration data writing<br>
means 15. In the parameter data set, these elements of the<br>
data set are arranged according to a determined syntax and<br>
are typically time multiplexed, as symbolically represented<br>
by an element generally referred to as combination means 16<br>
in Fig. 1.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
signaling means 14 is coupled to the configuration data<br>
writing means 15 via a control line 17 to activate the<br>
configuration data writing means 15 only when the parameter<br>
configuration cue has the first meaning, i.e. when, in a<br>
multi-channel reconstruction, no configuration information<br>
present in the decoder will be accessed in any way, but<br>
when there is explicit signaling, i.e. when further<br><br>
configuration information is present in the parameter data<br>
set. In the other case, in which the parameter<br>
configuration cue has the second meaning, the configuration<br>
data writing means 15 is not activated to introduce data in<br>
the parameter data set at the output 10, because such data<br>
would not be read by a decoder and/or would not be required<br>
by the decoder, as will be discussed later on. In the case<br>
of a mixed solution, instead of signaling everything in the<br>
data "stream, only a part of the configuration is signaled,<br>
while the rest is taken, for example, from the<br>
configuration table in the decoder.<br>
The signaling means 14 includes a control input 18, via<br>
which the signaling means 14 is informed of whether the<br>
parameter configuration cue is to have the first or the<br>
second meaning. As will be discussed with respect to Figs.<br>
4a and 4b, in the so-called "synchronous" operation, it is<br>
preferred to choose the parameter configuration cue so that<br>
it has the second meaning to obtain information on the<br>
coding algorithm in such a mode on the decoder side and to<br>
make configuration settings in the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means on the decoder side depending thereon.<br>
In the asynchronous operation, however, the control input<br>
18 will drive the signaling means such that it determines<br>
the first meaning for the parameter configuration cue,<br>
which will be interpreted by a decoder such that there is<br>
configuration information in the data themselves, and the<br>
audio coding algorithm on which the transmission channel<br>
data are based will not be used.<br>
It is to be noted that the parameter data set and/or the<br>
parameter data output do not have to be in a rigid form<br>
with respect to each other. Thus, the configuration cue,<br>
the configuration data and the parameter data do not<br>
necessarily have to be transmitted together in a stream or<br>
packet, but may also be provided to the decoder separately<br>
from each other.<br><br>
The following discussion will present the so-called<br>
"synchronous" operation with respect to Fig. 4a. For the<br>
purpose of illustration, Fig. 4a illustrates the parameter<br>
data as a sequence of frames 40, wherein the sequence of<br>
frames 40 is preceded by a header 41 in which there is the<br>
parameter configuration cue generated by the signaling<br>
means 14, and in which, if applicable, there is further<br>
configuration information generated by the configuration<br>
data writing means 15. The parameter data at the output of<br>
means 11 are accommodated in the frames 1, 2, 3, 4, which<br>
is the reason why they are also called payload data in Fig.<br>
4a.<br>
The continuation cue FSH, which is mentioned both in Fig. 1<br>
at the output of the signaling means 14 and is further also<br>
mentioned for the header 41 in Fig. 4a, causes a decoder to<br>
maintain, i.e. continue, a configuration setting previously<br>
communicated to the same, when it has a determined meaning,<br>
while, when the continuation cue FSH has another meaning,<br>
there is a decision on the basis of the parameter<br>
configuration cue whether configuration settings will be<br>
effected in the multi-channel reconstruction means based on<br>
configuration information in the data stream or based on<br>
configuration data retrieved by a cue to the audio coding<br>
algorithm on the decoder side.<br>
Fig. 4a further represents a sequence 42 of blocks of coded<br>
transmission data in time association, which also have four<br>
frames, frame 1, frame 2, frame 3, frame 4. The time<br>
association of the parameter data with the coded<br>
transmission channel data is illustrated by vertical arrows<br>
in Fig. 4a. Thus, a block of coded transmission channel<br>
data will always relate to a block of input data and/or,<br>
when overlapping windows are used, at least the advance how<br>
much data in a block are newly processed as compared to the<br>
previous block will be laid down and, in synchronous<br>
operation, will be synchronous with the block length and/or<br>
the advance at which the parameter data are obtained. This<br><br>
ensures that the connection between reconstruction<br>
parameters on the one hand and transmission channel data on<br>
the other hand is not lost.<br>
This will be explained by means of a short example.<br>
Assuming a 5-channel input signal, this 5-channel input<br>
signal will have five different audio channels including<br>
time samples from a time x to a time y, respectively. In<br>
the downmix stage 114 of Fig. 6, at least one transmission<br>
channel is then generated which will be synchronous with<br>
the multi-channel input data. A portion of the transmission<br>
channel data from time x to time y will thus correspond to<br>
a portion of the respective multi-channel input data from<br>
time x to time y. Furthermore, the BCC analysis means 116<br>
of Fig. 6 generates, for example, parameter data, again<br>
exactly for the time section of the transmission channel<br>
data from time x to time y, so that, on the decoder side,<br>
there may again be generated respective output channel data<br>
from time x to time y from the transmission channel data<br>
from time x to time y and the parameter data from time x to<br>
time y.<br>
A synchronous operation is automatically achieved when the<br>
framing with which the parameter data are generated and<br>
written is equal to the framing with which the audio<br>
encoder operates for compressing the one or more<br>
transmission channels. If thus the frames of both the<br>
parameter data and the coded transmission channel data (40<br>
and 42 in Fig. 4a) always relate to the same time portion,<br>
a multi-channel reconstruction device may easily always<br>
process data corresponding to an audio frame and process a<br>
parameter frame at the same time.<br>
In synchronous operation, the frame length of the audio<br>
encoder used for the transmission of the downmix data is<br>
thus equal to the frame length used by the parametric<br>
multi-channel scheme. Similarly, there is of course also<br>
the possibility that there is an integer relationship<br><br>
between the frame lengths and the parameter data and the<br>
coded transmission channel data. In this case, even the<br>
side information for parametric multi-channel coding may be<br>
multiplexed into the coded bit stream of the audio downmix<br>
signal so that a single bit stream may be generated. In the<br>
case of "retrofitting" already existing stereo data, there<br>
would still be two different data streams. However, there<br>
would be a relationship of 1:1 and/or m:l or m:n between<br>
the two sequences of frames. The framing rasters would<br>
never shift with respect to each other. Thus, there is an<br>
unambiguous association between the audio data frames and<br>
the corresponding parametric side information data frames.<br>
This mode may be favorable for various applications.<br>
According to the invention, the parameter configuration cue<br>
would have the first meaning in such a case. This means<br>
that there would be no or only part of the configuration<br>
information in the header 41, because the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means provides itself with information on<br>
the underlying audio encoder and, dependent thereon,<br>
chooses its configuration setting, i.e. for example the<br>
number of time samples for the advance or the block length,<br>
etc.<br>
In contrast, Fig. 4b shows an asynchronous operation. An<br>
asynchronous operation exists when the transmission channel<br>
data 42' do not, for example, have a frame structure, but<br>
only occur as a stream of PCM samples. Alternatively, such<br>
an asynchronous situation would also arise when the audio<br>
encoder has an irregular frame structure or simply a frame<br>
structure with a frame length and/or a frame raster<br>
differing from the frame raster of the parameter data 40.<br>
Here, the parametric multi-channel coding scheme and the<br>
audio coding/decoding means are thus considered as isolated<br>
and separate processing stages which do not depend on each<br>
other. This is particularly advantageous in the case of so-<br>
called tandem coding scenarios in which there are several<br>
successive stages of coding/decoding. If the parameter data<br><br>
were fixedly coupled to the compressed audio data, a multi-<br>
channel synthesis and a subsequent multi-channel analysis<br>
would have to be done simultaneously in each<br>
coding/decoding. As these operations are lossy, the losses<br>
would gradually accumulate, which would result in an<br>
increasing deterioration of the multi-channel impression.<br>
In such a tandem chain, the setting of the parameter<br>
configuration cue to the second meaning and the writing of<br>
configuration information into the data stream allow a<br>
configuration setting of the multi-channel reconstruction<br>
means in the decoder independently of the underlying audio<br>
encoder. Downmix data may thus be decoded/coded in any way<br>
without always having to perform a multi-channel synthesis<br>
or multi-channel analysis at the same time. The<br>
introduction of configuration information into the data<br>
stream and preferably into the parameter data stream<br>
according to the parameter data syntax allows, so to speak,<br>
to lay down an absolute association of the parameter data<br>
with time samples of the decoded transmission channel data,<br>
i.e. an association that is self-sufficient and is not<br>
given relative to an encoder frame processing rule, as in<br>
synchronous operation.<br>
In asynchronous operation, the deterioration of the multi-<br>
channel sound characteristics is thus prevented, because<br>
there is not always performed a multi-channel<br>
analysis/synthesis. The frame size for the parametric<br>
multi-channel coding/decoding thus does not necessarily<br>
have to be connected to the frame size of the audio<br>
encoder.<br>
The device of Fig. 1 can be implemented both as encoder and<br>
as so-called "forward transcoder". In the first case, the<br>
multi-channel parameter means calculates the parameter data<br>
itself. In the second case, it receives the parameter data<br>
already in a determined form and provides the inventive<br>
parameter data output with the parameter configuration cue<br><br>
and associated configuration data. The forward transcoder<br>
thus generates the inventive parameter data output from any<br>
data output.<br>
The reversal of this measure is done by a so-called<br>
"backward transcoder" which, from the inventive parameter<br>
data output, generates some output in which the parameter<br>
configuration cue is no longer contained, in which,<br>
however, the configuration data are also completely<br>
contained, so that no use of an audio coding algorithm is<br>
necessary in the multi-channel reconstruction for the<br>
configuration.<br>
According to the invention, the backward transcoder is<br>
designed as device for generating a parameter data output<br>
which, together with transmission channel data including M<br>
transmission channels, represent N original channels,<br>
wherein M is smaller than N and equal to or larger than 1,<br>
using input data, wherein the input data comprise a<br>
parameter configuration cue (41) that has a first meaning<br>
that configuration information for a multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means are contained in the input data, or<br>
has a second meaning that the multi-channel reconstruction<br>
means is to use configuration information depending on a<br>
coding algorithm (23) with which the transmission channel<br>
data have been decoded from a coded version thereof. It<br>
contains a writing means for writing configuration data,<br>
wherein the writing means is designed to first read the<br>
input data to interpret (30) the parameter configuration<br>
cue, and to retrieve information about a coding algorithm<br>
(23) with which the transmission channel data have been<br>
decoded from a coded version thereof and to output it as<br>
the configuration data, when the parameter configuration<br>
cue has the second meaning.<br>
In the following, there will be described a block circuit<br>
diagram of a device for generating a multi-channel audio<br>
signal according to a preferred embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention with respect to Fig. 2. For generating the multi-<br>
channel audio signal, input data are used that include<br>
transmission channel data representing the M transmission<br>
channels and that further include parameter data 21 to<br>
obtain K output channels. The M transmission channels and<br>
the parameter data together represent N original channels,<br>
wherein M is smaller than N and is equal to or larger than<br>
1, and wherein K is larger than M. Furthermore, the input<br>
data include a parameter configuration cue PKH, as already<br>
discussed, while the transmission channel data 20 are a<br>
decoded version of transmission channel data 22 coded<br>
according to a coding algorithm. In the embodiment shown in<br>
Fig. 2, the decoding algorithm is realized by an audio<br>
decoder 2 3 having a coding algorithm operating, for<br>
example, according to the MP3 concept or according to MPEG-<br>
2 (AAC) or according to any other coding concept.<br>
The device to be used on the decoder side shown in Fig. 2<br>
includes a multi-channel reconstruction means 24 designed<br>
to generate the K output channels at an output 25 from the<br>
transmission channel data 20 and the parameter data 21.<br>
Furthermore, the inventive device shown in Fig. 2 includes<br>
configuration means 26 designed to configure the multi-<br>
channel reconstruction means 24 by signaling a<br>
configuration setting via a signaling line 27. The<br>
configuration means 2 6 receives the input data and<br>
preferably the parameter data 21 to read and<br>
correspondingly process the parameter configuration cue,<br>
the continuation cue FSH and possibly present configuration<br>
data. Furthermore, the configuration means includes a<br>
coding algorithm signaling input 28 to obtain information<br>
about the audio coding algorithm on which the decoded<br>
transmission channel data are based, i.e. the coding<br>
algorithm executed by the audio encoder 23. The information<br>
may be obtained in different ways, for example from an<br>
observation of the decoded transmission channel data, if it<br>
can be seen from them with which coding algorithm they have<br><br>
been coded/decoded. Alternatively, the audio decoder 23 may<br>
itself communicate its identity to the configuration means<br>
26. Still alternatively, the configuration means 2 6 may<br>
also parse the coded transmission channel data 22 to<br>
determine a cue from the coded transmission channel data<br>
according to which coding algorithm coding has taken place.<br>
Such a "coding algorithm signature" will typically be<br>
contained in each output data stream of an encoder.<br>
In the following, a preferred implementation of the<br>
configuration means will be described based on a block<br>
diagram with respect to Fig. 3a. The configuration means 2 6<br>
is designed to read the parameter configuration cue PKH<br>
from the input data and to interpret it, as illustrated in<br>
block 30. If the parameter configuration cue has a first<br>
meaning, the configuration means will continue to read in<br>
the parameter data stream to extract configuration<br>
information (or at least part of the configuration<br>
information) in the parameter data stream, as illustrated<br>
in block 31. If, however, step 30 determines that the<br>
parameter configuration cue PKH has the second meaning, the<br>
configuration means will obtain information on a coding<br>
algorithm on which the decoded transmission channel data<br>
are based, in step 32.<br>
If there are several basically possible coding algorithms<br>
for which the inventive device for generating the multi-<br>
channel signal is designed, step 32 is followed by a<br>
subsequent step 33 in which the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means determines (33) a configuration<br>
setting based on information existing on the decoder side.<br>
This may be done, for example, in the form of a look-up<br>
table (LUT) . If, at the end of step 32, an audio encoder<br>
identification cue is obtained, a look-up table is entered<br>
in step 33 using the audio encoder identification cue,<br>
wherein the audio encoder identification cue is used as<br>
index. Associated in the index there are found various<br><br>
configuration settings, such as block length, sampling<br>
rate, advance, etc. associated with such an audio encoder.<br>
A configuration setting is then applied to the multi-<br>
channel reconstruction means in step 34. If, however, the<br>
first meaning of the parameter configuration cue is chosen<br>
in step 30, the same configuration setting is effected<br>
based on configuration information contained in the<br>
parameter data stream, as represented by the connecting<br>
arrow between block 31 and block 34 in Fig. 3.<br>
The inventive scheme is flexible in that it supports both<br>
explicit and implicit configuration information signaling<br>
methods. This is what the parameter configuration cue PKH<br>
serves for, which is preferably inserted as flag and, in<br>
the best case, requires only a single bit to indicate the<br>
signaling of the configuration information per se. The<br>
parametric multi-channel decoder may subsequently evaluate<br>
this flag. If the availability of explicitly available<br>
configuration information is signaled with this flag, this<br>
configuration information is used. If, on the other hand,<br>
implicit signaling is indicated by the flag, the decoder<br>
will use the information on the used audio or voice coding<br>
method and apply configuration information based on the<br>
signaled coding method. For this purpose, the parametric<br>
multi-channel decoder and/or the multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means preferably has a look-up table<br>
containing the standard configuration information for a<br>
determined number of audio or voice encoders. There are,<br>
however, also other possibilities than a look-up table<br>
which may, for example, include hard-wired solutions, etc.<br>
Generally, the decoder is capable of providing the<br>
configuration information with predetermined information<br>
present in itself depending on the actually present encoder<br>
identification information.<br>
This concept is particularly advantageous in that a<br>
complete configuration of the parameter scheme may be<br><br>
achieved with a minimum of additional effort, wherein, in<br>
the extreme case, a single bit will be sufficient, which<br>
forms a contrast to the situation that all configuration<br>
information would have to be written explicitly into the<br>
data stream itself with a considerably higher effort<br>
regarding bits.<br>
According to the invention, the signaling may be switched<br>
back and forth. This allows simple multi-channel data<br>
handling, even if the representation of the transmission<br>
channel data changes, for example when the transmission<br>
channel data are decoded and later coded again, i.e. when<br>
there is a tandem coding situation.<br>
The inventive concept thus allows the saving of signaling<br>
bits in the case of synchronous operation on the one hand<br>
and switching to asynchronous operation on the other hand,<br>
if necessary, i.e. an efficient bit-saving implementation<br>
and, on the other hand, flexible handling, which will be of<br>
particular interest in connection with the<br>
"supplementation" of existing stereo data to a multi-<br>
channel representation.<br>
In the following, there will be given an exemplary<br>
implementation of the inventive device for generating a<br>
multi-channel audio signal with the example of a syntax<br>
pseudo code, with respect to Fig. 4c. First, the value of<br>
the variable "useSameBccConfig" is read in. Here, the<br>
variable serves as continuation cue. So, there is only a<br>
continuation to interpret the parameter configuration cue<br>
when this variable, i.e. the continuation cue, has a value<br>
equal to, for example, 1. If, however, the continuation cue<br>
is unequal to 1, i.e. it has the other meaning, a<br>
previously transmitted configuration is used. If there is<br>
no configuration in the multi-channel reconstruction means<br>
yet, it has to wait until it obtains the very first<br>
configuration information and/or configuration setting.<br><br>
The following will examine the parameter configuration cue.<br>
The variable "codecToBccConfigAlignment" serves as<br>
parameter configuration cue PKH. If this variable is equal<br>
to 1, i.e. if it has the second meaning, the decoder will<br>
not use any further configuration information, but will<br>
determine the configuration information based on the<br>
encoder identification, such as MP3, CoderX or CoderY, as<br>
can be seen from the lines starting with "case" in Fig. 4c.<br>
It is to be noted that, by way of example, the syntax shown<br>
in Fig. 4c only supports MP3, CoderX and CoderY. However,<br>
any other coding names/identifications may be added.<br>
When, for example, MP3 has been determined as encoder<br>
information, the variable bccConfigID is set to, for<br>
example, MP3_V1, which is the configuration for an<br>
underlying MP3 encoder with the syntax version VI.<br>
Subsequently, the decoder is configured with a determined<br>
parameter set based on this BCC configuration<br>
identification. Thus, for example, a block length of 576<br>
samples is activated as configuration setting. Thus, a<br>
framing having this block length is signaled.<br>
Alternative/additional configuration settings may be the<br>
sampling rate, etc. If, however, the parameter<br>
configuration cue (codecToBccConfigAlignment) has the first<br>
meaning, i.e. for example the value 0, the decoder will<br>
explicitly receive configuration information from the data<br>
stream, i.e. it will receive a distinct bccConfigID from<br>
the data stream, i.e. from the input data. The following<br>
procedure is then the same as just described. In this case,<br>
however, an identification of the decoder for decoding the<br>
coded transmission channel data is not used for<br>
configuration purposes of the multi-channel reconstruction<br>
means.<br>
Thus, the bccConfigID may be used for the purpose of<br>
decoding the transmission channel data in the case of an<br>
MP3 audio decoder for configuring a multi-channel<br>
reconstruction means. On the other hand, there may also be<br><br>
any other configuration information bccConfigID in the data<br>
stream and may be evaluated, irrespective of whether or not<br>
the underlying audio encoder is an MP3 encoder. The same<br>
applies to other predefined configuration settings, such as<br>
CoderX and CoderY, and to a further free configuration in<br>
which the configuration information (bccConfiglD) is set to<br>
individual. In preferred embodiments, there are further<br>
configuration information in the data stream which, in<br>
turn, signal to the decoder that it should use a mixture of<br>
already predefined configuration information present in the<br>
decoder and explicitly transmitted configuration<br>
information.<br>
Unlike the above-described embodiments, the present<br>
invention may also be applied to other multi-channel<br>
signals which are no audio signals, such as parametrically<br>
coded video signals, etc.<br>
Depending on the circumstances, the inventive method for<br>
generating and/or decoding may be implemented in hardware<br>
or in software. The implementation may be done on a digital<br>
storage medium, in particular a floppy disk or CD having<br>
control signals that may be read out electronically, which<br>
may cooperate with a programmable computer system so that<br>
the method is executed. In general, the invention thus also<br>
consists in a computer program product having a program<br>
code for performing the method stored on a machine-readable<br>
carrier, when the computer program product runs on a<br>
computer. In other words, the invention may thus be<br>
realized as a computer program having a program code for<br>
performing the method, when the computer program runs on a<br>
computer.<br><br>
