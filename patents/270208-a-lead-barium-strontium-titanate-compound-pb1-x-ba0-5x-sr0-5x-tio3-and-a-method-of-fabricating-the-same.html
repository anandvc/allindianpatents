The following specification describes the invention.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
[0001] Embodiments in general relate to a lead-barium-strontium-titanate compound having, a chemical comptosiion expressed by compositional formula Pbi1-xBa0.5xSr0.5xTiO3, [referred to as PBST hereinafter], and more particularly to a ferroelectric tead-barium-strontium-5 titanate compound for use in transducers as sensing element and in capacitors as a dielectric, whereas data storage devices as a memory element, wherein the PBST compound is characterized by having a high dielectric constant, a low dieletric loss, a low porosity, a high mechanical strength and a remnant polarization. The PBST compound of the present invention may bei the form of a  pellet or a thin film or any other suitable form, shape and size. A method 10      of fabricating the PBST compound is also disclosed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION [0002] In the fast growing electronic and computing industry, few basic components like resistors, capacitors, sensors, transducers and memory devices have great significance, wherein the basic working principle of each of these components is well  understood. Improvement and 15 enhancement of these components, wherein their reliability, life   expectancy and production costs are optimized, is hot field of research. The search for new material that will improve and enhance the performance of these components is sorted after continuously -<br>
[0003] Capacitors are electronic components, wherein it  is possible to store electrical energy  in  the form of electric field, for use in devices, for exmple, camera flashes, pulsed lasers, 20 electronic  filters etc. The capacitors have found many other uses in the electronics and microelectronics circuits, beyond serving as mere electrical energy store houses. In another form, the microscopic capacitors are used as memory banks of computers, wherein the presence and absence  of  their  electric fields serves as '0' and ' 1'  bit of  information.<br>
[0004] In general, a capacitor comprises a pair of isolated  conductor plates (which may 25 be of any  shape) separated by a dielectric medium. The dielectric medium may be air, oil, mica, paper, ceramic or any other material like barium titanate, lead magnesium niobate etc., particularly having a dipole moment. When a capacitor is charged, its plates acquire equal but opposite charge, which leads to a potential difference between the plates. The amount of electrical energy  that may be stored in a capacitor depends on the geometry  of the plates and the dielectric 30 constant of the material between them. The capacity of the capacitor to hold the electrical energy is termed as the capacitance of the capacitor,<br>
[0005] An ideal capacitor is desired to have high volumetric efficiency, that is, high capacitance per unit volume, meaning that, the capacitor must be capable of storing large amount<br><br>
of electrical energy, which may be utilized for many appliances like flash in camera, filters used in rectification processes, pulsed lasers etc.<br>
[0006] Further, it is desired that the size of the capacitor should be small, which is necessary to build smaller, faster, low electricity consuming and powerful electronic devices for 5      various applications.<br>
[OOO7] It is known that high volumetric efficiency of a capacitor may be obtained by use of dielectric material with higher dielectric constant, and at the same time maintaining the capacitor size to certain minimum dimensions.<br>
[0008] The electronic devices and hence the components are used in environments where<br>
10      they are subjected to wide range of temperatures. If is desired that the capacitors that are to be<br>
used in these electronic devices should provide a stable capacitance over a wide range of<br>
temperatures, meaning thereby, the dielectric constant of the dielectric material being used,<br>
should exhibit almost stable value over wide irange of temperatures.<br>
[0009] Further, in the electronic devices, and hence the components, which are used at 15 high frequencies, it is desired that the capacitor used in the circuitry of those devices should exhibit stable and low dielectric loss at high frequencies.<br>
|00010] In the prior art many compounds are known to be used in capacitor with high dielectric constant and low dielectric loss.<br>
[00011 ] In particular, the lead titanate based ceramics are known to exhibit high dielectric 20 constant and low dielectric loss. For example, the paper titled "Dielectric and tunable properties of Pb0.25B3xSr0.75-xTiO3hin films fabricated by a modified sol-gel method" by X. H. Sun et ai, Thin Solid Films 516 (2008) 1308-1312, explains synthesis of Pb0.25BaxSr0.75-xTiO3 hin films by a modified sol-gel method on P1/TiO2/SiO2/Si substrate, wherein the structure, the surface morphology, dielectric and tunable properties of the thin films have been investigated as a 25 function of barium concentration, wherein the investigators found that barium content of these thin films had pronounced effect on above properties of PBST thin fi1ms.<br>
[00012] In particular, the paper reports that the grain size, dielectric constant, dielectric loss and tunability increases as the barium content in the thin film increases.<br>
[00013] Further, the paper discloses that the Pb0.25Ba0.2Sr0.55TiO3 thin film showed the 30      highest dielectric constant and tunability such as 1390 and 80.6% respectively.<br>
[00014] However, the paper does not reveal or even indicate what will be the characteristics of the material with variable amount of all the three, namely, lead, barium and strontium. The paper on contrary discloses a material with fixed percentage of lead, 0.25 and the<br><br>
percentages  of barium   and  strontium  are  only  varied  in  accordance  with  the   formula Pb0.25BaxSr0.75-xTiO3.<br>
[00015] A further important electronic component is the memory element, wherein it is possible to store and/or modify data or information. Memory elements such as dynamic random 5      access memories [DRAMs] and static random access memories [SRAM's] currently dominate the market. But these arc volatile in nature i.e. the stored information is lost when the power fails.<br>
[000 16] It is known that the memory elements mentioned above stores information by<br>
virtue of a remnant polarization of the material, wherein the material is spontaneously polarized<br>
by application of electric field, in analogy to ferromagnetism, the polarization of the material may<br>
10      be removed by application of a reverse field, forming a hysteresis loop. The materials are known<br>
as ferroelectric materials in analogy to ferromagnetic materials.<br>
[00017] The    other   available   alternatives    include   complementary    metal    oxide<br>
semiconductors (CMOS) wife battery backup and electrically erasable read only memories<br>
(EEPROM's). These non-volatile memories are very expensive.<br>
15	[00038] It is desired to have memory devices which are not volatile in nature that is, the<br>
stored information is not lost when the  power fails.<br>
[00019] It is additionally desired to have memory devices which are economical as compared to that available com merciaily at present.<br>
[00020] Pressure transducers [referred to as transducers hereinafter] are components 20      wherein the mechanical stress or pressure is converted into a detectable electrical signal. In prior art, materials known to be used as sensing element in transducers are lead magnesium niobate, lead titanate solid solutions, single crystals of Rochelle salt, piezoelectric composites, etc.<br>
[00021] In a transducer with lead titanate (or any other material) based ceramic being<br>
used as a pressure sensing element, the pressure induces stress in the sensing element, which in<br>
25      turn leads to generation of electro-motive force {referred to as e.m.f hereinafter] due to the<br>
piezoelectric nature of these compounds. This e.m.f. generated is amplified and detected. A<br>
suitably calibrated pressure sensing element may be used to build a transducer.<br>
[00022] It is desired that the sensing element in the transducer should have high mechanical strength so that it can withstand high pressures, which means that its porosity should 30      be low.<br>
[00023] It is desirable that all  of these components, namely, capacitors, memory elements and transducers, have reduced size &amp; cost and enhanced capacity &amp; reliability in addition to being low energy consuming devices.<br><br>
[00024] From above, it is evident that in the prior art, the lead titanate based compounds<br>
are known to be used in capacitors as dielectric material, as sensing element in transducers and as<br>
memory element in memory devices, have one or other disadvantage or shortcomings as<br>
discussed above.<br>
5	[00025] It is desired that one could design [a material or] a compound, in particular, a<br>
lead titanate based compound, such that the characteristics of the compound including the dielectric constant, the dielectric loss, the porosity, the mechanical strength and remnant polarization may be tailored for a specific application, wherein the characteristics of the compound including the dielectric constant, the dielectric loss, the porosity, the mechanical 10 strength and the remnant polarization may be controlled by changing the percentages of at least one of lead, barium and strontium.<br>
[00026] Further, it is desired that the designed lead titanate based compound should be<br>
stable over long period of time, meaning thereby, the designed material and hence the devices<br>
and/or components fabricated there from should have long lifespan.<br>
15	[00027] Still further, it is desired that the designed lead titanate based compound should<br>
be stable over wide range of temperatures, meaning thereby, the designed lead titanate based compound and hence &amp; the  devices and/or components  fabricated there from, should be able to operate at wide range of temperatures.<br>
[00028] Thus, there is a need to have a lead titanate based compound, wherein it is<br>
20      possible to control the dielectric constant, the dielectric loss, the porosity, the mechanical strength<br>
and the remnant polarization of the lead titanate based compound by varying the percentages of at<br>
least one of lead, barium or strontium, wherein the said lead titanate based compound may be<br>
used in devices including capacitors, memory devices and transducers.<br>
[00029] Additionally, it is a necessary to have a lead titanate based compound, wherein 25      the compound should have stable behavior over a wide range of temperatures, pressures, higher operating frequency and over a long time span.<br>
