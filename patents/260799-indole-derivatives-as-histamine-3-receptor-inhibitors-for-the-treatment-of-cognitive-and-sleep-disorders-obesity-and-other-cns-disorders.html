CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority of U.S. provisional patent application Serial<br>
No. 60/726,793 filed October 14,2005, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to compounds having pharmacological activity, to<br>
compositions containing these compounds, and to a method of treatment employing the<br>
compounds and compositions. More particularly, this invention concerns certain indole<br>
derivatives and their salts and solvates. These compounds alter H3 histamine receptor activity.<br>
This invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these compounds and<br>
to a method of treating disorders in which histamine H3 receptor blockade is beneficial.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Histamine is a chemical messenger involved in various complex biological<br>
actions. When released, histamine interacts with specific macromolecular receptors on the<br>
cell surface or within a target cell to elicit changes in many different bodily functions.<br>
Various cell types including smooth muscle, blood cells, cells of the immune system,<br>
endocrine and exocrine cells as well as neurons respond to histamine by modulating the<br>
formation of intracellular signals, including of phosphatidylinositol, or adenylate cyclase.<br>
Evidence that histamine plays a role as a neurotransmitter was established by the mid-to-late<br>
1970's (Schwartz, 1975) life Sci. 17:503-518. Immunohistochemical studies identified<br>
histaminergic cell bodies in the tuberomammillary nucleus of the posterior hypothalamus<br>
with widespread projections in the diccncephalon and telencephalon (Inagaki et al., 1998) J.<br>
Comp. Neurol. 273:283-300.<br>
Two histamine receptors (H1 and H2) were reported to mediate the<br>
biochemical actions of histamine on neurons. More recently, studies have demonstrated the<br>
existence of a third subtype of histamine receptor, the histamine H3 receptor (Schwartz et al.,<br><br>
1986) TIPS 8:24-28. Various studies have now demonstrated that histamine H3 receptors are<br>
found on the histaminergic nerve terminals in the brains of several species, including man<br>
(Arrang et al., 1983) Nature 302: 832-837. The H3 receptor found on the histaminergic nerve<br>
terminal was defined as an autoreceptor and could intimately control the amount of histamine<br>
released from the neurons. Histamine, the natural compound, was capable of stimulating this<br>
autoreceptor but testing of known H1 and H2 receptor agonists and antagonists suggested that<br>
the H3 receptor has a distinct pharmacological profile. Further, H3 receptors have been<br>
identified on cholinergic, serotoninergic and monoamine nerve terminals in the peripheral<br>
nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system including the cerebral cortex and cerebral<br>
vessels. These observations suggest that H3 receptors are uniquely located to modulate<br>
histamine as well as other neurotransmitter release, and compounds that bind H3 receptors<br>
could be important mediators of neuronal activity.<br>
As stated, CNS histaminergic cell bodies are found in the magnocellular nuclei<br>
of the hypothalamic.mammillary region and these neurons project diffusely to large areas of<br>
the forebrain. The presence of histaminergic cell bodies in the tuberomammillary nucleus of<br>
the posterior hypothalamus, a brain area involved in the maintenance of wakefulness, and<br>
their projections to the cerebral cortex suggest a role in modulating the arousal state or sleep-<br>
wake cycle. The histaminergic projection to many limbic structures such as the hippocampal<br>
formation and the amygdaloid complex suggest roles in functions such as autonomic<br>
regulation, control of emotions and motivated behaviors, and memory processes.<br>
The concept that histamine is important for the state of arousal, as suggested<br>
by the location of histaminergic pathways, is supported by other types of evidence. Lesions<br>
of the posterior hypothalamus are well known to produce sleep. Neurochemical and<br>
electrophysiological studies have also indicated that the activity of histaminergic neurons is<br>
maximal during periods of wakefulness and is suppressed by barbiturates and other hypnotics.<br>
Intraventricular histamine induces the appearances of an arousal EEG pattern in rabbits and<br>
increased spontaneous locomotor activity, grooming and exploratory behavior in both saline<br>
and pentobarbital-treated rats.<br>
In contrast, a highly selective inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase, the sole<br>
enzyme responsible for histamine synthesis, has been shown to impair waking in rats. These<br>
data support the hypothesis that histamine may function in modulating behavioral arousal.<br>
The role of the H3 receptor in sleep-waking parameters has been demonstrated (Lin et al.,<br>
1990) Brain Res. 592: 325-330. Oral administration of RAMHA, a H3 agonist, caused a<br>
significant increase in deep slow wave sleep in the cat. Conversely, thioperamide, a H3<br>
2<br><br>
antagonist/inverse agonist, enhanced wakefulness in a dose-dependent fashion.<br>
Thioperamide has also been shown to increase wakefulness and decrease slow-wave and<br>
REM sleep in rats. These findings are consistent with in vivo studies demonstrating that<br>
thioperamide caused an increase in synthesis and release of histamine. Together, these data<br>
demonstrate that selective H3 antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful in the treatment<br>
of arousal states and sleep disorders.<br>
Serotonin, histamine, and acetylcholine have all been demonstrated to be<br>
diminished in the Alzheimer's (AD) brain. The histamine H3 receptor has been demonstrated<br>
to regulate the release of each of these neurotransmitters. An H3 receptor antagonist or<br>
inverse agonist would therefore be expected to increase the release of these neurotransmitters<br>
in the brain. Since histamine has been demonstrated to be important in arousal and vigilance,<br>
H3 receptor antagonists or inverse agonists might enhance arousal and vigilance via<br>
increasing levels of neurotransmitter release and thereby improve cognition. Thus, the use of<br>
compounds that bind the use of H3 receptor in AD, attention deficit disorders (ADD), age-<br>
related memory dysfunction and other cognitive disorders would be supported.<br>
H3 receptor antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful in treating several<br>
other CNS disorders. It has been suggested that histamine may be involved in cerebral<br>
circulation, energy metabolism, and hypothalmic hormone secretion. For example, H3<br>
receptor antagonists or inverse agonists have been demonstrated to affect food intake and<br>
body weight gain in rodents. Recent evidence has indicated the possible use of H3<br>
antagonists or inverse agonists in the treatment of epilepsy. Work has demonstrated an<br>
inverse correlation between the duration of clonic convulsions and brain histamine levels.<br>
Thioperamide was also shown to significantly and dose-dependently decrease the durations<br>
of every convulsive phase after electrically-induced convulsions and increase the<br>
electroconvulsive threshold.<br>
In spite of their low density, H3 receptor binding sites can be detected outside<br>
the brain. Several studies have revealed the presence of H3 heteroreceptors in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract, as well as upon neurons of the respitory tract. Accordingly, an H3<br>
receptor binding compound may be useful in the treatment of diseases and conditions such as<br>
asthma, rhinitis, airway congestion, inflammation, hyper and hypo motility and acid secretion<br>
of the gastrointestinal tract. Peripheral or central blockage of H3 receptors may also<br>
contribute to changes in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiovascular output and could be<br>
used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and in the treatment of diseases or<br>
conditions such as obesity, migraine, inflammation, motion sickness, pain, ADHD, dementia,<br>
3<br><br>
depression, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, epilepsy, narcolepsy, acute myocardial<br>
infarction and asthma.<br>

Certain compounds of the invention may exist in different isomeric (e.g.<br>
enantiomers and distereoisomers) forms. The invention contemplates all such isomers both<br>
in pure form and in a mixture, including racemic mixtures. Enol and tautomeric forms are<br>
also included.<br>
The compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated<br>
forms, including hydrated forms, e.g., hemi-hydrate. In general, the solvated forms, with<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like are equivalent to the<br>
unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention also form pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts, e.g., acid addition salts. For example, the nitrogen atoms may form salts with acids.<br>
Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic,<br>
citric, oxalic, malonic, salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic<br>
and other mineral carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salts are prepared by<br>
contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt in<br>
the conventional manner. The free base forms may be regenerated by treating the salt with a<br>
suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous hydroxide, potassium carbonate,<br>
ammonia, and sodium bicarbonate. The free base forms differ from their respective salt<br>
forms somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the<br>
acid salts are equivalent to their respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>

comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which<br>
results, directly or indirectly, from a combination of the specified ingredients in the specified<br>
amounts.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be used in the form of<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts derived from inorganic or organic acids. The phrase<br>
"pharmaceutically acceptable salt" means those salts which are, within the scope of sound<br>
medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals<br>
without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and the like and are commensurate with a<br>
reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are well-known in the art. For<br>
example, S. M. Berge et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J.<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences. 1977. 66:1 et seq. The salts can be prepared in situ during the final<br>
isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention or separately by reacting a free<br>
base function with a suitable organic acid. Representative acid addition salts include, but are<br>
not limited to acetate, adipate, alginate, citrate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate,<br>
9<br><br>
bisulfate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, digluconate, glycerophosphate,<br>
hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, fumarate, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-<br>
hydroxyethansulfonate (isothionate), lactate, maleate, methanesulfonate, nicotinate, 2-<br>
naphthalenesulfonate, oxalate, palmitoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate,<br>
pivalate, propionate, succinate, tartrate, thiocyanate, phosphate, glutamate, bicarbonate, p-<br>
toluenesulfonate and undecanoate. Also, the basic nitrogen-containing groups can be<br>
quatemized with, such agents as lower alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl<br>
chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, dibutyl and diamyl<br>
sulfates; long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and stearyl chlorides, bromides and<br>
iodides; arylalkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides and others. Water or oil-soluble<br>
or dispersible products are thereby obtained. Examples of acids which can be employed to<br>
form pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts include such inorganic acids as<br>
hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid and such organic<br>
acids as oxalic acid, maleic acid, succinic acid and citric acid.<br>
Basic addition salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and<br>
purification of compounds of this invention by reacting a carboxylic acid-containing moiety<br>
with a suitable base such as the hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable metal cation or with ammonia or an organic primary, secondary or tertiary amine.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, but are not limited to, cations based on alkali<br>
metals or alkaline earth metals such as lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium and<br>
aluminum salts and the like and nontoxic quaternary ammonia and amine cations including<br>
ammonium, tetramethylammonium, tetraethylammonium, methylammonium,<br>
dimethylammonium, trimethylammonium, triethylammonium, diethylammonium, and<br>
ethylammonium among others. Other representative organic amines useful for the formation<br>
of base addition salts include ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, piperidine,<br>
piperazine and the like.<br>
Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention<br>
include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under<br>
sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives,<br>
buffers or propellants which can be required. Opthalmic formulations, eye ointments,<br>
powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention.<br>
Actual dosage levels of active ingredients in the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of this invention can be varied so as to obtain an amount of the active compound(s) which is<br>
effective to achieve the desired therapeutic response for a particular patient, compositions and<br>
10<br><br>
mode of administration. The selected dosage level will depend upon the activity of the<br>
particular compound, the route of administration, the severity of the condition being treated<br>
and the condition and prior medical history of the patient being treated. However, it is within<br>
the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the<br>
desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is<br>
achieved.<br>
When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of one of the compounds of the present invention can be employed in pure form or, where<br>
such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or prodrug form. Alternatively,<br>
the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition containing the<br>
compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
excipients. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound of the invention<br>
means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk<br>
ratio applicable to any medical treatment It will be understood, however, that the total daily<br>
usage of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the<br>
attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically<br>
effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including<br>
the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound<br>
employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and<br>
diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of<br>
the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or<br>
coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the<br>
medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound<br>
at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually<br>
increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a<br>
human or lower animal may range from about 0.0001 to about 1000 mg/kg/day. For purposes<br>
of oral administration, more preferable doses can be in the range of from about 0.001 to about<br>
5 mg/kg/day. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for<br>
purposes of administration; consequently, single dose compositions may contain such<br>
amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions that<br>
comprise compounds of the present invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be specially<br>
11<br><br>
formulated for oral administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal<br>
administration.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to<br>
humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally,<br>
intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal<br>
spray. The term "parenterally," as used herein, refers to modes of administration which<br>
include intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous and<br>
intraarticular injection and infusion.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising a component of the present invention and a physiologically tolerable<br>
diluent. The present invention includes one or more compounds as described above<br>
formulated into compositions together with one or more non-toxic physiologically tolerable<br>
or acceptable diluents, carriers, adjuvants or vehicles that are collectively referred to herein as<br>
diluents, for parenteral injection, for intranasal delivery, for oral administration in solid or<br>
liquid form, for rectal or topical administration, among others.<br>
The compositions can also be delivered through a catheter for local delivery at<br>
a target site, via an intracoronary stent (a tubular device composed of a fine wire mesh), or<br>
via a biodegradable polymer. The compounds may also be complexed to ligands, such as<br>
antibodies, for targeted delivery.<br>
Compositions suitable for parenteral injection may comprise physiologically<br>
acceptable, sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions<br>
and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions.<br>
Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include<br>
water, ethanol, polyols (propyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, glycerol, and the like),<br>
vegetable oils (such as olive oil), injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, and suitable<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
These compositions can also contain adjuvants such as preserving, wetting,<br>
emulsifying, and dispensing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be<br>
ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol,<br>
phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It may also be desirable to include isotonic agents, for<br>
example sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable<br>
pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for<br>
example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
12<br><br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, may contain suspending<br>
agents, as for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan<br>
esters, microcrystallme cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar and<br>
tragacanth, or mixtures of these substances, and the like.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of the drug, it is desirable to slow<br>
the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be<br>
accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with<br>
poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of<br>
dissolution which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively,<br>
delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or<br>
suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the<br>
drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio<br>
of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release<br>
can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drug in<br>
liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile<br>
solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile<br>
injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound may be mixed with<br>
at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier, such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose,<br>
mannitol and silicic acid; b) binders such as carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone, sucrose and acacia; c) humectants such as glycerol; d) disintegrating<br>
agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain<br>
silicates and sodium carbonate; e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin; (f) absorption<br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; g) wetting agents such as cetyl<br>
alcohol and glycerol monostearate; h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay and i)<br>
lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols,<br>
sodium lauryl sulfate and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the<br>
dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
13<br><br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft<br>
and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills and granules can be<br>
prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in<br>
the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and may<br>
also be of a composition such that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially,<br>
in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of<br>
embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form, if appropriate,<br>
with one or more of the above-mentioned excipients.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable emulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active<br>
compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art<br>
such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsiflers such as<br>
ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl<br>
benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethyl formamide, oils (in particular,<br>
cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl<br>
alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions may also include adjuvants such<br>
as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming<br>
agents.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which<br>
are solid at room temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum<br>
or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can also be administered in the form of<br>
liposomes. As is known in the art, liposomes are generally derived from phospholipids or<br>
other lipid substances. Liposomes are formed by mono- or multi-lamellar hydrated liquid<br>
crystals which are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any non-toxic, physiologically<br>
acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes can be used. The present<br>
compositions in liposome form can contain, in addition to a compound of the present<br>
14<br><br>
invention, stabilizers, preservatives, excipients and the like. The preferred lipids are natural<br>
and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidyl cholines (lecithins) used separately or together.<br>
Methods to form liposomes are known in the art See, for example, Prescott,<br>
Ed., Methods in Cell Biology.Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N.Y. (1976), p. 33<br>
et seq.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein represents<br>
those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the scope of<br>
sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and lower<br>
animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate with<br>
a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the zwitterionic<br>
forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. Prodrugs of the present invention<br>
may be rapidly transformed in vivo to the parent compound of the above formula, for<br>
example, by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V.<br>
Stella, Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, V. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in<br>
Edward B. Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical<br>
Association and Pergamon Press (1987), hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Compounds of the present invention that are formed by in vivo conversion of a<br>
different compound that was administered to a mammal are intended to be included within<br>
the scope of the present invention.<br>
Compounds of the present invention may exist as stereoisomers wherein<br>
asymmetric or chiral centers are present. These stereoisomers are "R" or "S" depending on<br>
the configuration of substituents around the chiral carbon atom. The present invention<br>
contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof. Stereoisomers include enantiomers<br>
and diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of<br>
compounds of the present invention may be prepared synthetically from commercially<br>
available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of<br>
racemic mixtures followed by resolution well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to<br>
a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or<br>
chromatography and liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary or (2) direct<br>
separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns.<br>
The compounds of the invention can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated<br>
forms, including hydrated forms, such as hemi-hydrates. In general, the solvated forms, with<br>
15<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water and ethanol among others are equivalent<br>
to the unsolvated forms for the purposes of the invention.<br>
The invention may be illustrated by the following representative scheme and<br>
examples.<br><br>

Representative compounds of the present invention that were prepared by the<br>
procedures of Examples 1-41 were evaluated in binding assays against cells expressing<br>
human H3 receptor by the following procedure.<br>
Cell culture<br>
Materials<br>
[125I]iodoproxyfan (2000 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Amersham Bioscience<br>
Piscataway, NJ). [3H]Nα-methyhistamine (85 Ci/mmmol) was purchased from Perkin<br>
Elmers Life Science (Boston, MA). Calcium 3 dye kit was from Molecular Devices<br>
(Sunnyvale, CA). All other chemicals were either from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) or<br>
Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO).<br>
RAGE methodology<br>
The human histamine H3 receptor was stably expressed in HT1080 cells containing<br>
the chimeric G-protein, Gq i5 (Coward et al., Anal Biochem 1999; 270:242-8). HT1080-<br>
Gqoci5 cells were grown in alpha-modified MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 7<br>
μg/ml blasticidin at 37° C in 5% CO2/95% atmosphere. Cells (4.8x109) were irradiated with<br>
50 rads from a 137Cs source and the pFG8-HH3 RAGE (Random Activation of Gene<br>
Expression; see Harrington et al., Nature Biotechnology. 2001; 19:440-45) vector was<br>
subsequently integrated into the cells via electroporation (250V, 600μF, 50O). The RAGE<br>
vector pFG8-HH3 contained cDNA sequence coding for the first exon (83 amino acids) of<br>
human H3 receptor. After electroporation, cells were plated in 175 flasks and grown in<br>
alpha-modified MEM. The culture medium was replaced 48 hours after electroporation with<br>
alpha-modified MEM, 10% fetal bovine serum, 500 μg/ml hygromycin B and 3 μg/ml<br>
puromycin. Medium was replaced every four days during cell expansion. To identify RAGE<br>
activated cells expressing the H3 receptor, pools of approximately 10,000 colonies (5x107-<br>
1.5x108 cells total) were screened by PCR for the desired gene product (using primers<br>
specific to the RAGE vector and exon 2 of the H3 receptor). Pools that were found to contain<br>
the appropriate transcript, as confirmed by sequencing, were subcloned into pools of 100<br>
cells/well. Positive 100 cells/well pools were identified by PCR, confirmed by sequencing,<br>
and subsequently subcloned to 0.8 cells/well. Once clones expressing the H3 receptor were<br>
identified by PCR analysis, assays (FLIPR or radioligand binding) were performed to<br>
48<br><br>
confirm that the activated gene produced functional protein. The protein expression in the<br>
initial clones obtained from the RAGE library was increased by growth in the presence of<br>
methotrexate. Since the integrated RAGE vector contains the DHFR gene, such treatment<br>
selects for cells that have amplified the genetic locus containing the RAGE insert. Subclones<br>
obtained after methotrexate amplification were tested for functional activity in FLIPR assays<br>
to identify the clone that was most suitable for HTS. The final HT1080-Gqαi5 RAGE clone<br>
(RAGE-H3) expressing the human histamine H3 receptor was grown in alpha-modified<br>
MEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 3 μg/ml puromycin, 500 μg/ml hygromycin B, 3.2<br>
uM methotrexate at 37° C in 5% CO2/95% atmosphere.<br>
Membrane preparation<br>
RAGE-H3 cells (109) were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped off the plates, and<br>
centrifuged at 1000 x g for 5 minutes. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold 10 mM Tris HCl,<br>
pH 7.4, containing 5 mM EDTA and protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Molecular<br>
Biochemicals). After incubating on ice for 10 minutes, the cells were homogenized with a<br>
dounce homogenizer or a polytron tissue grinder, and centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 minutes<br>
at 4° C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 32, 000 x g for 30 minutes at 4° C. The<br>
membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris HC1, pH 7.4, and stored at - 80° C until<br>
use. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad Laboratories,<br>
CA).<br>
Radioligand binding assays<br>
Binding assays were carried out in 96-well polypropylene plates in 50 mM Tris HCl,<br>
pH 7.4, containing 1 mM EDTA. Reaction mixtures contained 100 μl of membrane<br>
suspension, 50 μl of 4% DMSO, and 50 μl of increasing amounts of [125I]iodoproxyfan (final<br>
concentration 0.0005-1.8 nM for human H3 receptor saturation binding assay). Nonspecific<br>
binding was defined by adding 10 μM clobenpropit to the reaction mixtures. Competition<br>
binding assays were performed in a reaction mixture containing 100 ul of membrane<br>
suspension (~ 20 μg of protein/well), 50 μl of [125I]iodoproxyfan (final concentration of ~<br>
0.15 nM) and 50 μl of test compound. Compounds were dissolved in DMSO and then diluted<br>
with 4% DMSO; the final maximal DMSO concentration in the binding assays was 1%.<br>
Incubations were performed for 1.5 hours at room temperature and reactions were terminated<br>
49<br><br>
by rapid filtration over glass fiber GF/C filters (Perkin Elmer, MA) using a Brandel cell<br>
harvester. The filters were presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneirnine for 30 minutes and were<br>
washed with 500 ml of ice-cold 50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 The filters were dried, impregnated<br>
with Meltilex wax scintillate (Perkin Elmer, MA) and counted with a Betaplate scintillation<br>
counter (Perkin Elmer, MA).<br>
Calcium mobilization assays<br>
RAGE-H3 or HT1080-mH3 cells were seeded in black 384-well plates and incubated<br>
overnight at 37° C in a 5% CO2/95% atmosphere. After removing medium, cells were treated<br>
with CsCl Ringer's buffer (136 mM CsCl, 5.4 mM KC1, 5.5 mM D-Glucose, 20 mM Hepes,<br>
pH 7.4, 2.1 mM MgCl2,1.2 mM CaCl2) containing the Calcium 3 dye (Molecular Device,<br>
CA) and probenecid (3.75 DM) for 60 minutes, according to manufacture's instruction.<br>
Compounds were diluted in CsCl Ringer's buffer containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and<br>
1.0% DMSO. The dose response of (R)-α-memylMstamine-stimulated Ca2+ flux was<br>
measured on a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices, CA) and the<br>
concentration of (R)-α-methylhistamine to stimulate 75% of maximum response was used to<br>
test the inhibitory effect of compounds.<br>
Data analysis<br>
All data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares curve fitting using Prism 4.0 software. The<br>
KD and Bmax for [125I]iodoproxyfan were derived from the equation RL=RtL /(KD +L), where<br>
RL is concentration of receptor-bound ligand at equilibrium, L is the free ligand<br>
concentration, and Rtis the total receptor concentration (i.e., Bmax)- For competition binding<br>
experiments, IC50 values (the concentration of compound producing 50% inhibition of<br>
specific binding) and Hill Coefficients (nH) were derived from fitting the data to a 4-<br>
parameter logistic equation. Apparent K, values were calculated using the Cheng-Prussof<br>
equation of K; = IC50/(1+(L/KD)), where L is the ligand concentration. Agonist stimulation<br>
and antagonist inhibition in FLIPR were fitted to sigmoidal dose response curves using the<br>
equation Y = Bottom + (Top-Bottom)/(l+10A(LogEC50-X)), where X is the logarithm of<br>
concentration of compounds and Y is the fluorescent response. Z' values [15] were derived to<br>
evaluate the quality of the assays. Figures are representative of two to three separate<br>
experiments performed in triplicates or quadruplicates.<br>
