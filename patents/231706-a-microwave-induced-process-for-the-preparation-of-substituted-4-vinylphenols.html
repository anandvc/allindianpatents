				<td>A MICROWAVE INDUCED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF<br>
SUBSTITUTED 4-VINYLPHENOLS<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to "A microwave induced process for the preparation of<br>
substituted 4-vinylphenols' in which commercially important FEMA GRAS approved<br>
perfumery and flavouring vinylphenols (i.e. hydroxystyrenes) namely 4-vinylguaiacol<br>
(FEMA GRAS No. 2675) and 4-vinylphenol (FEMA GRAS No. 3739) as well as<br>
other useful vinylphenols such as 2,6-dimethoxy-4-vinylphenol, 2-hydroxy-4-<br>
vinylphenol, 3-hydroxy-4-vinylphenol etc. are obtained in a one pot during<br>
condensation of malonic acid and corresponding substituted 4-hydroxy<br>
phenylaldehydes (4-hydroxy benzaldehydes) under microwave irradiation.<br>
In the present invention, the formation of substituted vinylphenols is the first example<br>
from 4-hydroxy phenylaldehydes in one step under microwave irradiation otherwise<br>
literature till today reveals the formation of vinylphenols only by decarboxylation of<br>
cinnamic acid either by microorganisms or conventional methods.<br>
Background Art<br>
Aroma compounds of natural origin are of major interest to flavour and fragrance<br>
industries, however, nature alone cannot meet the ever-increasing world demand on its<br>
own due to limited percentage of such compounds in plant kingdom. Therefore, there<br>
is a growing interest in developing alternative sources for natural aroma compounds<br>
and in particular, substituted 4-vinylphenols such as 4-vinylguaiacol (p-vinylguaiacol<br>
or 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol or 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene or 4-ethenyl-2-<br>
methoxyphenol), 4-hydroxystyrene (p-vinylphenol or 4-ethenylphenol), 3,5-<br>
dimethoxy-4-hydroxy styrene and others have been the most extensively investigated<br>
ones due to their widespread applications in food and alcoholic beverages, flavouring<br>
substances and as intermediates in the preparation of polymers and copolymers useful<br>
in coatings, electronic applications, ion exchange resins and photo resists etc.<br>
(Perfume and Flavor Chemicals, Aroma Chemicals, ed. Steffen, A., Allured<br>
Publishing Corporation, Vol I-IV (1994) and Encyclopedia of Food and Color<br>
Additives, ed. George, A.B., CRC Press, Inc., Vol I-II (1996)). The preparation of<br>
these substituted 4-vinylphenols such as 4-vinylguaiacol (FEMA GRAS No. 2675), 4-<br>
vinylphenol (FEMA GRAS No. 3739) and others are well known in the art,<br>
however, a more efficient process for preparing substituted 4-vinylphenols is<br>
desired and needed. The present invention provides a process wherein microwave<br>
assisted (Bose, A.K., Banik, B.K., Lavlinskaia, N., Jayaraman, M. and Manhas, M.S.,<br>
Chemtech, 27, 18-24, (1997) and Larhed, M. and Hallberg, Drug Discovery Today,<br>
6(8), 406-416, (2001)) condensation of substituted 4-hydroxy phenylaldehydes and<br>
malonic acid in the presence of organic base and organic acid provides only<br>
substituted 4-vinylphenols in one pot within 20 minutes and not cinnamic acid as<br>
generally obtained in conventional Knoevenagel-Doebner condensation reaction<br>
(Furniss, B.S., Hannaford, A.J., Rogers, V., Smith, P.W.G. and Tatchell, A.R: In:<br>
Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, fourth Edn., ELBS, UK, 802<br>
(1978); Susanne, R.H., Kerry, C.A., Dae, D.M., Ducan, J.N., Christopher, H.L.,<br>
Rita, H.M., Mary, L. E., Nanette, N. F., Martin, S.W., Kjell, S. A., Matt, Z. J.,<br>
Arvid, C. and Chiu-Hong, L., J. Med. Chem., 44, 4716-4732 (2001) and James, M.,<br>
Jennifer, A. S. and Sonja, W., Tetrahedron Letters, 39, 8013-8016 (1998)). It is<br>
worthwhile to mention that microwave-assisted chemical transformation is a new<br>
emerging technique which is generally known for ecofriendly, rapid and high yielding<br>
process, however, such a surprising effect of microwave is observed for the first time<br>
in the above invention where both condensation and decarboxylation have occurred<br>
simultaneously without addition of decarboxylating agent.<br>

methods have been proven to be useful, they suffer from one or more process<br>
deficiencies. For example, in some instances processes of this type necessarily<br>
involve resort to sub-ambient temperatures, which of course, involves some<br>
considerable process control and lead to reaction mixtures.<br>
It, therefore, becomes an object of the invention to provide rapid and economical<br>
process for the preparation of substituted 4-vinylphenols from cheaper and<br>
commercially available 4-hydroxy phenylaldehydes as well as to eliminate the<br>
disadvantages associated with the above patents and papers.<br>
In conclusion, the present invention discloses a simple and economical process for<br>
preparing vinylphenols starting from relatively cheaper and economical material 4-<br>
hydroxyphenylaldehydes and malonic acid in the presence of organic acid and organic<br>
base under microwave condition. Other objectives and advantages of the present<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>

(i.e. hydroxystyrenes^ such as 4-vinylguaiacol, 4-vinylphenol, 2,6-dimethoxy-4-<br>
vinylphenol, 2-hydroxy-4-vinylphenol, 3-hydroxy-4-vinylphenol and many others in<br>
one pot under microwave irradiation utilizing cheaper substrates in the form of<br>
malonic acid and substituted phenylaldehydes. The regents used are in the form of a<br>
base selected from a group of organic bases consisting of pyridine, piperidine,<br>
collidine, triethylamine and an acid selected from a group of organic acids consisting<br>
of formic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid and others. The final product i.e. substituted<br>
4-vinylphenols was obtained in moderate yield varying from 37-51 % within 20<br>
minutes. It is worthwhile to mention that this microwave-assisted unique process is in<br>
fact an unexpected result of two individual steps (i.e. condensation and<br>
decarboxylation) observed for the first time during reaction of substituted 4-~<br>
hydroxyphenylaldehydes with malonic acid in one step without addition of<br>
decarboxylating agent. In addition to above, it is also noticed that presence of<br>
hydroxy substitution at 4 position of phenylaldehyde is an essential requirement<br>
towards formation of vinylphenol in one step under microwave condition. It is also<br>
important to note that conducting the above reaction by conventional method instead<br>
of microwave provides only cinnamic acid even when substituted 4-hydroxy<br>
phenylaldehydes is taken as a starting materials.<br>

are being carried out by the scientific community for the smooth production of aroma<br>
chemicals. Some of vinylphenols and related styrenes are widely used in fragrances<br>
and flavours as safe aroma molecules for human consumption, though, high<br>
concentration of vinylphenols sometimes produce an off-note in flavours. Beside,<br>
vinylphenols are also known to possess a wide range of biological activities including<br>
antibacterial, antifungal and hypolipidemic activities etc. (William, A. A., David, J.<br>
M. and Priyotosh, C., Phytochemistry, 42(5), 1321-1324 (1996); Adriana, C., Leticia,<br>
G., Maria, S., Elizdath, M., Hugo, A. J., Francisco, D., German, C. and Joaquin, T.,<br>
Arzneim.-Forsch./Drug Res., 51(11), 535-544 (2001)). In addition to above,<br>
vinylphenols and related styrenes are also found as versatile intermediates for a wide<br>
range of products (Stuart, R. R., Colette, S. M. and David, J. L., Biorganic &amp;<br>
Medicinal Chemistry, 2(6), 553-556 (1994); Atsushi, M., Takeo, K. and Yoshinobu,<br>

C., Barbara, G. and Miguel, A. R., Tetrahedron Letters, 41, 979-982 (2000).<br>
The widespread natural vinylphenols and related styrenes are obtained from a variety<br>
of plants e.g. 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, also known as vinylguaiacol (FEMA GRAS<br>
NO. 2675) is obtained from the pods of Hibiscus esculentus (okra) and Digitaria<br>
exilis and also found in cooked apple, grapefruit juice (Citrus paradisi), feijoa fruit<br>
(Feijoa sellowiand), Vitis vinifera, strawberry fruit, raw asparagus, leaves and stalks<br>
of celery, crispbread, white wine, red wine, coffee, partially fermented tea, roasted<br>
peanuts (Arachis hypogea), raw beans, red sage (Taxus sage) and other natural sources<br>
(Jennifer, M. A. and Glesni, M., Phytochemistry, 29 (4), 1201-1207 (1990); Hanna,<br>
P., Michael, N., Uri, Z., Russell, L. R. and Steven, N., J. Agric. Food Chem., 40, 764-<br>
767 (1992) and Lasekan, O.O., Teixeira, J.P. F. and Salva, T. J. G., Food Chemistry,<br>
75, 333-337 (2001)). In addition to above, 4-vinylguiacol is also present in several<br>
coffee plants wherein out of more than 100 different chemical constituents, 4-<br>
vinylguiacol is identified as one of the most powerful potent odorants on the basis of<br>
aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) (Flavour Science Recent Developments, ed.<br>
Taylor, A.J. and Mottram, D.S., The Royal Society of Chemistry, pp.200-205<br>
(1996)). Similarly, 4-vinylguiacol is also found as one of the most odour active<br>
compounds in roasted white sesame seeds which are widely used as a flavouring<br>
material in food stuffs. In Asia, the oil isolated from the roasted sesame seed is used<br>
in seasoning of many dishes, while in Europe and United States, the roasted seeds are<br>
used in bakery products (Progress In Flavour Precursor Studies, ed. Schreier, P.,<br>

W., Akira, Y., Shiro, N. and Shigero, T., J. of Chromatography A, 793, 409-413<br>
(1998)). On the same lines, 4-vinylphenol, also known as 4-hydroxystyrene, (FEMA<br>
GRAS NO. 3739) is found in cooked apple, black currants (buds), raw asparagus,<br>
tomato, cognac, white wine, red wine, rose wine, coffee, green tea, partially fermented<br>
tea, microbial fermented tea, heated soyabean, Boletus edulis, coriander seed<br>
(Coriandrum sativum), oil of vetiver (Vetiveria zizamioides), olive oil and other<br>

V. and Colin, E. S., J. of Chromatography A, 967, 235-242 (2002)). Apart from the<br>
above-mentioned vinylphenols, there are several other styrenes, which are found in<br>
different plants and are known for various applications. For example, styrene, also<br>
known as ethylene benzene (FEMA GRAS NO. 3233), is found in Psidium guajava<br>
(guava fruit), Annus comosus (pineapple), Arachis hypogea (roasted peanuts) and also<br>
in dairy and beverage products. Similarly, o-vinylanisole (FEMA GRAS No. 3248) is<br>
found in Origanum vulgare, whereas, 4-vinylveratrole and 2,4,5-lrimethoxy-lvinylbenzene<br>
are found in rum, coffee and in several other natural products<br>
(Nagashima, F., Murakami, Y. and Asakawa, Y., Phytochemistry, 51, 1101-1104<br>
(1999).<br>
In the pretext of above discussion, 4-vinylphenols and related styrenes can<br>
unhesitatingly be counted as greatly valued to humankind. However, the limited<br>
percentage of these substituted 4-vinylphenols in plant kingdom is not sufficient to<br>
fulfill the world demand. As a result, a large quantity of 4-vinylphenols and related<br>
styrenes are made synthetically as well as through microbial transformation where the<br>
production of styrenes from cinnamic acid has been the most extensively investigated<br>
method. A number of chemical methods are reported in literature for the preparation<br>
of vinylphenols and related styrenes (Alwyn, S., J. of Organometallic Chemistry, 247,<br>
117-122, (1983); Matthias, B., Hartmut, F. and Klaus, K., Tertahedron Lettrs, 35(47),<br>
(1994); Cavani, F. and Trifiro, F., Applied Catalysis A: General, 133, 219-239 (1995);<br>
Atsushi, T., Atsushi, M., Takeo, K. and Yoshinobu, I., Reactive &amp; Functional<br>
Polymers, 37, 39-47, (1998); Takaya, M., Roy, A.P., Douglas, J. T. and Hajime, Y.,<br>
Journal of Catalysis, 206, 272-280 (2002)), 'however, the most widely used chemical<br>
methods for preparing styrenes involve decarboxylation of trans-cinnamic acids which<br>
is carried out by heating under reflux the cinnamic acids at 200-300°C for several<br>
hours in quinoline in the presence of copper powder (Organic Synthesis<br>
Collective Volume I, 441-442 (1941) and Volume IV, 731-734 (1963); Robert, A. S.,<br>
Charles, R. D. and Leo, A. P., Tertrahedron Letters, 49, 4447-4450 (1976)).<br>
Similarly, catalytic oxidation of 1,1 -diphenylethane (l,l-di-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethane)<br>
provides styrene (i.e. 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene) (Perfume and Flavor Chemicals<br>
(Aroma Chemicals), ed. Steffen, A., Allured Publishing Corporation, Vol II, 1891<br>
(1994)). In addition to chemical methods, several microbial transformations are also<br>
reported for the preparation of styrenes especially substituted vinylphenols (Masumi,<br>
T. and Kazuo, A., Tetrahedron Letters, 40, 6595-6598 (1999) and Encyclopedia of<br>
Food and Color Additives, ed. George, A.B., CRC Press, Inc., Vol II, 1705 (1996)).<br>
So far, the published biotransformation including patent processes for the production<br>
of styrenes provide relatively low yields since vinylphenols and related styrenes get<br>
further degraded to other side products e.g. biotransformation of ferulic acid provides<br>
not only the main product 4-vinylguaiacol but also vanillin, vanillic acid and<br>
protocatechuic acid as side products, depending upon biocatalyst and conditions<br>
(Takuya, K., Yasurou, I., Shinji, F., Kiyoshi, I. and Kimio, I, J. of Fermentation and<br>
Engineering, 82(1), 46-50, (1996); Lee, I, Volm, T. G. and Rosazza, J. P. N., Enzyme<br>
and Microbial Technology, 23, 261-266, (1998)). Some other fermentation processes<br>
are also known in which ferulic acid is decarboxylated to 4-vinylguaiacol. A wellknown<br>
example is the production of wheat beer where a specific top-yeast produces 4-<br>
vinylguiacol from ferulic acid in high concentration. This high concentration of 4-<br>
vinylguiaeol imparts a characteristic flavour to the beer and greatly adds to its value<br>
(Understanding Natural Flavours, ed Pigget, J.R. and Patterson, A., Blackie Academic<br>
&amp; Professional, New York , pp.211-227 (1994)). Similarly, several other<br>
microorganisms, fungi, yeast and bacteria are able to decarboxylate a large number of<br>
substituted cinnamic acids into corresponding substituted styrenes including<br>
vinylphenols from hydroxycinnamic acids (Yasuyuki, H. and Santoshi, T., Archives of<br>
Biochemistry and Biophysics, 359(2), 225-230, (1998); Edlin, D. A. N., Narbad, A.,<br>
Gasson, M. J., Dickinson, J. R. and Lloyd, D., Enzyme and Microbial Technology, 22,<br>
232-239 (1998); Masumi, T. and Kazuo, A., Tetrahedron Lettrs, 40, 6595-6598,<br>
 (1999); Tripathi, U, Rao, S. R. and Ravishankar, G. A., Process Biochemistry, 38,<br>
419-426, (2002)).<br>
All the above methods have various limitations, for example, low yield, expensive<br>
reagents and formation of unwanted side products. Keeping in view the above<br>
problems, we disclose a unique and novel microwave-assisted process to prepare 4-<br>
vinylphenols and related styrenes (Examples I, II, III) in one step from hydroxy<br>
substituted phenylaldehydes and malonic acid in the presence of an organic base and<br>
an organic acid (Jean, J. V. E. and Delphine, R., Tetrahedron, 55, 2687-2694 (1999)).<br>
In fact, it is a chance observation in which we were trying to emulate Knoevenagel<br>
Doebner condensation (Furniss, B.S., Hannaford, A.J., Rogers, V., Smith, P.W.G.<br>
and Tatchell, A.R: In: Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry, fourth Edn.<br>
(ELBS, UK), 802 (1978)) reaction under microwave irradiation because of advantages<br>
inherent with microwave especially shorter reaction time, minimum or no side<br>
products, and overall environmental friendly conditions (Bose, A.K., Banik, B.K.,<br>
Lavlinskaia, N., Jayaraman, M. and Manhas, M.S., Chemtech, 27, 18-24, (1997);<br>
Larhed, M. and Hallberg, Drug Discovery Today, 6(8), 406-416, (2001); Kuang, C.,<br>
Senboku, H. and Tokuda, M., Tetrahedron, 58, 1491-1496, (2002) and Kuhnert, N.,<br>
Angew. Chem. Int. Ed., 41, 1863-1866, (2002)). With this intention, microwave<br>
assisted condensation of 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde and malonic acid was<br>
performed towards formation of 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acids (Example IV)<br>
followed by its dehydrogenation to obtain a rarer natural 3-(3,4,5-<br>
trimethoxy)phenylpropionic acid (Example V) since a large number of biologically<br>
active 3-phenylpropionic acids have been found in nature and some of substituted 3-<br>
phenylpropionic acids are intermediate for synthesis of useful organic compounds as<br>
well as synthesis of various drugs such as anti-aids, nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory<br>
drug and dopamine D3 receptor antagonist drug (Das, B.; Kashinatham, A.; Srinivas,<br>
K.V.N.S. Planta Medica, 62, 582, (1996); Johannes, G.V.; Gerarad, R.; Richard, G.<br>
Tetrahedron Letters, 39 8329-8332, (1998); Kamperdick, C.; Phuong, N.M.; Sung,<br>
T.V., Schmidt, J. Phytochemistry, 52, 1671-1676, (1999); Susanne, H.R.; Kerry, C.A.;<br>
Dae, D.M.; Duncan, J.N.; Christopher, H.L.; Rita, H.M.; Mary, L.E.; Nanette, N.F.;<br>
Martin, S.W.; Kjell, S.A.; Matt, Z.J.; Arvid, C.; Lin, C.H., J. Med. Chem., 44, 4716-<br>
4732, (2001)). With the success of the preparation of 3,4,5-trimethoxycinnamic acid<br>
and its dihydro product (3,4,5-trimethoxy dihydrocinnamic acid), a large number of<br>
other substituted benzaldehydes (i.e. 4-methoxybenzaldehyde or 3,4-<br>
dimethoxybenzaldehyde or 2,4,5-trimethoxybenzaldehyde or<br>
dioxymethylenebenzaldehyde or 3-chlorobenzaldehyde or 4-nitrobenzaldehyde etc.)<br>
were found successful under microwave towards formation of corresponding cinnamic<br>
acids (i.e. 4-methoxycinnamic acid or 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde or 2,4,5-<br>
trimethoxycinnamic acid or dioxymethylene cinnamic acid or 3-chlorocinnamic acid<br>
or 4-nitrocinnamic acid etc.) including 3-hydroxycinnamic acid (Example VII).<br>
Surprisingly, microwave assisted condensation of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxybenzaldehyde<br>
(vanillin) with malonic acid failed to provide expected 3-methoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic<br>
acid (ferulic acid) but it provided a good smelling liquid compound, which is<br>
identified as 4-vinylguaiacol on the basis of spectral data (Example I). 'H NMR. of<br>
liquid compound showed 14 protons (Example I) which is expected for protons of<br>
ferulic acid (Example VI), however, we found two different dolublet at 5 5.19 (1H, d),<br>
and 6 5.66 (1H, d), besides a double of doublet at 8 6.6 (2H, dd), which was unlike'<br>
ferulic acid where two doublets appear at 5 5.7 (1H, d), and at 8 6.7 (1H, d). Similarly,<br>
'3C NMR of liquid compound indicates the presence of 9 carbons (Example I) without<br>
presence of carbonyl group instead of 10 carbons including carbonyl group as<br>
expected for ferulic acid. DEPT-135 confirms the presence of one CH2 at 8C 111.8.<br>
Overall spectral data indicates the presence of 4-vinylguaiacol and not the ferulic acid<br>
as expected. Finally, mass spectra confirm the structure liquid as 4-vinyl guaiacol<br>
(99.4% purity by GC).<br>
In conclusion, our invention discloses a simple and economical process for preparing<br>
vinylphenols starting from relatively cheaper and economical material 4-<br>
hydroxyphenylaldehydes and malonic acid in the presence of organic acid and organic<br>
base under microwave condition, which avoids the use of cinnamic acid and<br>
decarboxylating agent and longer reaction time.<br>
