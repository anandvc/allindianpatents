If appropriate, salts can be prepared from the compounds of the general formula (I)<br>
according to the invention. Such salts are obtained in a simple manner by customary<br>
methods for forming salts, for example by dissolving or dispersing a compound of<br>
the formula (I) in a suitable solvent, such as, for example, methylene chloride,<br>
5	acetone, tert-butyl methyl ether or toluene, and adding a suitable base. The salts can<br>
then - if appropriate after prolonged stirring - be isolated by concentration or filtration with suction.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention can be used as defoliants,<br>
10	desiccants, haulm killers and, especially, as weedkillers. Weeds in the broadest sense<br>
are to be understood as meaning all plants which grow in locations where they are not wanted. Whether the substances according to the invention act as total or selective herbicides depends essentially on the amount used.<br>
15	The active compounds according to the invention can be used, for example, in<br>
connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous weeds of the genera: Abutilon, Amaranthus, Ambrosia, Anoda, Anthemis, Aphanes, Atriplex, Bellis, Bidens, Capsella, Carduus, Cassia, Centaurea,<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds according to the invention are<br>
15	suitable for total weed control, for example on industrial sites and rail tracks and on<br>
paths and areas with or without tree growth. Equally, the compounds according to the<br>
invention can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for example<br>
forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards,<br>
banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm<br>
20	plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns and turf<br>
and pastures and for selective weed control in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal<br>
activity and a broad activity spectrum when applied on the soil and on above-ground<br>
25	parts of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for selective control of<br>
monocotyledonous    and    dicotyledonous    weeds    in    monocotyledonous    and dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>
At certain concentrations or application rates, the active compounds according to the<br>
30	invention can also be used for controlling animal pests and fungal or bacterial plant<br>

diseases. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By<br>
5	plants are understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and<br>
undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional "breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including transgenic plants and including plant<br>
10	varieties which may or may not be protectable by plant variety property rights. Parts<br>
of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Plant parts also include harvested goods and<br>
15	vegetative and generative propagation material,  for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
20	storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation materials, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by single- or multi-layer coating.<br>
25	The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>

These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is to say liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is to say emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam formers. 5<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Liquid solvents which are mainly suitable are: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic  hydrocarbons,  such  as  chlorobenzenes,  chloroethylenes  or methylene<br>
10	chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example<br>
petroleum fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol, and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and water.<br>

Suitable solid carriers are: for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates; suitable solid carriers for granules are: for example crushed<br>
20	and fractionated natural rocks, such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, dolomite<br>
and synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material, such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam formers are: for example nonionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for<br>
25	example    alkylaryl    polyglycol     ethers,     alkylsulphonates,     alkyl    sulphates,<br>
arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose, natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
30	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and<br>
31<br><br>

synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use dyestuffs, such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
5	titanium oxide, Prussian blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo<br>
dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations generally comprise between 0.1 and 95 per cent by weight of active<br>
10	compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
For controlling weeds, the active compounds according to the invention, as such or in<br>
the form of their formulations, can also be used as mixtures with known herbicides<br>

As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or<br>
protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
5	transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate<br>
in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
10	Particularly preferably, plants  of the plant  cultivars which  are  in  each case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
15<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
20	increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention - also in combination with other agro-chemical active compounds -, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
25	a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
30	which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in<br>
the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly<br>
35<br><br>
Le A 35 696-Foreign Countries<br>
-35-<br>
advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties<br>
are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance,<br>
easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
5	a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active<br>
10	compounds.  Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the<br>
15	plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the<br>
plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to<br>
20	fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic  acquired resistance (SAR),  systemin,<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the<br>
25	"PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be<br>
present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for  example  maize,   cotton,   soya  beans),   KnockOut®   (for  example  maize),<br>
30	StarLink®   (for   example  maize),   Bollgard®   (cotton),   Nucotn®   (cotton)   and<br>
NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned<br>
36<br><br>
Le A 35 696-Foreign Countries<br>
-36-<br>
are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the<br>
trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton,<br>
soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for<br>
5	example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for<br>
herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>

The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention, where in addition to the good control of weed plants, the abovementioned synergistic effects with the transgenic plants or<br>
15	plant cultivars occur. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or<br>
mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>

5	Solvent:	5 parts by weight of acetone<br>
Emulsifier:      1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of<br>
10	emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired<br>
concentration.<br>
Test plants of a height of 5-15 cm are sprayed with the preparation of active<br>
compound such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied<br>
15	per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen such that the particular<br>
amounts of active compound desired are applied in 1000 1 of water/ha.<br>
After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage in comparison to the development of the untreated control. 20<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0% = no effect (like untreated control) 100% = total destruction 25<br>
In this test, for example, the compounds of Preparation Examples 1, 15, 18, 20, 22, 39, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, 55 and 56 show a considerably stronger activity against weeds and a substantially better compatibility with crop plants such as, for example, maize, oilseed rape and wheat than the known compounds (A) and (B).<br>

However, the use of the active compounds according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
Depending on the concentration, the active compounds according to the invention are<br>
15	suitable for total weed control, for example on industrial sites and rail tracks and on<br>
paths and areas with or without tree growth. Equally, the compounds according to the<br>
invention can be employed for controlling weeds in perennial crops, for example<br>
forests, ornamental tree plantings, orchards, vineyards, citrus groves, nut orchards,<br>
banana plantations, coffee plantations, tea plantations, rubber plantations, oil palm<br>
20	plantations, cocoa plantations, soft fruit plantings and hop fields, on lawns and turf<br>
and pastures and for selective weed control in annual crops.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention have strong herbicidal<br>
activity and a broad activity spectrum when applied on the soil and on above-ground<br>
25	parts of plants. To a certain extent, they are also suitable for selective control of<br>
monocotyledonous    and    dicotyledonous    weeds    in    monocotyledonous    and dicotyledonous crops, both by the pre-emergence and by the post-emergence method.<br>

diseases. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates or precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. By<br>
5	plants are understood here all plants and plant populations such as desired and<br>
undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which can be obtained by conventional "breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or combinations of these methods, including transgenic plants and including plant<br>
10	varieties which may or may not be protectable by plant variety property rights. Parts<br>
of plants are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-ground parts and organs of plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. Plant parts also include harvested goods and<br>
15	vegetative and generative propagation material,  for example seedlings, tubers,<br>
rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment of the plants and parts of plants according to the invention with the<br>
active compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
20	storage area according to customary treatment methods, for example by dipping,<br>
spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, brushing-on and, in the case of propagation materials, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by single- or multi-layer coating.<br>
25	The active compounds can be converted into the customary formulations, such as<br>
solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusts, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspo-emulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic substances impregnated with active compound, and microencapsulations in polymeric substances.<br>

in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been explained above.<br>
10	Particularly preferably, plants  of the plant  cultivars which  are  in  each case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") and which have been obtained by conventional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. They can be cultivars, bio- or genotypes.<br>
15<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an<br>
20	increase in the activity of the substances and compositions to be used according to<br>
the invention - also in combination with other agro-chemical active compounds -, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
25	a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products are possible which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering)<br>
30	which are preferably treated according to the invention include all plants which, in<br>
the genetic modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly<br>
35<br><br>
Le A 35 696-Foreign Countries<br>
-35-<br>
advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties<br>
are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased<br>
tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance,<br>
easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or<br>
5	a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active<br>
10	compounds.  Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized are in particular increased defence of the<br>
15	plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the<br>
plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to<br>
20	fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic  acquired resistance (SAR),  systemin,<br>
phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the<br>
25	"PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be<br>
present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for  example  maize,   cotton,   soya  beans),   KnockOut®   (for  example  maize),<br>
30	StarLink®   (for   example  maize),   Bollgard®   (cotton),   Nucotn®   (cotton)   and<br>
NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned<br>
36<br><br>
Le A 35 696-Foreign Countries<br>
-36-<br>
are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the<br>
trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton,<br>
soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape),<br>
IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylurea, for<br>
5	example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manner for<br>
herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
10<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention, where in addition to the good control of weed plants, the abovementioned synergistic effects with the transgenic plants or<br>
15	plant cultivars occur. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or<br>
mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
20	The following examples show the preparation and use of the active compounds<br>
according to the invention:<br>

Preparation examples: Example 1<br><br>
0.45 g (2.19 mmol) of 5-methoxy-4-methyl-2-phenoxycarbonyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-l,2,4-triazol-3-one is dissolved in 50 ml of acetonitrile and, at room temperature (about 20°C), mixed with stirring, a little at a time, with 0.60 g (2.41 mmol) of 4-<br>
10	ethoxycarbonyl-2-methyl-thiophene-3-sulfonamide and with 0.37 g (2.41 mmol) of<br>
l,8-diazabicyclo-[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU). The reaction mixture is stirred at room temperature for 12 hours and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue is taken up in methylene chloride and washed successively with IN hydrochloric acid and with water, dried with sodium sulphate and filtered. The filtrate is concentrated<br>
15	under reduced pressure, the residue is digested with isopropanol and the resulting<br>
crystalline product is isolated by filtration with suction.<br>
This gives 0.60 g (68% of theory) of ethyl 4-[[[(3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-lH-<br>
l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-5-methyl-3-thiophenecarboxylate   as   a<br>
20	pale yellow solid of melting point 176°C.<br>
The sodium salt of the compound prepared according to Example 1 can be prepared, for example, as follows:<br>
25	1.0   g  (2.5   mmol)   of ethyl   4-[[[(3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-<br>
yl)carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-5-methyl-3-thiophenecarboxylate are taken up in 25 ml of methylene chloride, and 0.10 g (2.5 mmol) of sodium hydroxide (micropellets) are<br>
38<br><br>
Le A 35 696-Foreign Countries<br>
-38<br>
added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature (or 20°C) for 15 hours. The crystalline product is then isolated by filtration with suction.<br>
This gives 1.0 g of ethyl 4-[[[(3-methoxy-4-methyl-5-oxo-lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-yl)carbonyl]amino]sulfonyl]-5-methyl-3-thiophenecarboxylate sodium salt of melting point 220°C.<br><br>

Emulsifier:      1 part by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active<br>
compound is mixed with the stated amount of solvent, the stated amount of<br>
10	emulsifier is added and the concentrate is diluted with water to the desired<br>
concentration.<br>
Test plants of a height of 5-15 cm are sprayed with the preparation of active<br>
compound such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied<br>
15	per unit area. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen such that the particular<br>
amounts of active compound desired are applied in 1000 1 of water/ha.<br>
After three weeks, the degree of damage to the plants is rated in % damage in comparison to the development of the untreated control. 20<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0% = no effect (like untreated control) 100% = total destruction 25<br>
In this test, for example, the compounds of Preparation Examples 1, 15, 18, 20, 22, 39, 42, 45, 46, 47, 48, 55 and 56 show a considerably stronger activity against weeds and a substantially better compatibility with crop plants such as, for example, maize, oilseed rape and wheat than the known compounds (A) and (B).<br>
