PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD:<br>
This invention relates to a thermoplastic coating composition. More particularly, it relates to a composition for coating directly to thermoplastic and thermosetting plastic materials without the aid of primer coat.<br>
This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the thermoplastic coating composition for coating directly to thermoplastic and thermosetting plastic materials without the aid of primer coat.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Plastic materials such as thermoplastic olefins (TPO), which typically comprise of polypropylene and an elastomer, have many desirable properties, e.g., light weight, durability, low cost, etc., that make them an attractive material for manufacture of many interior and exterior automotive parts and accessories, containers, household appliances, and other commercial items. It is often desirable to coat articles made from such plastic materials with organic coating compositions to decorate them or to protect the plastic materials from degradation when exposed to atmospheric weathering conditions. To achieve longer lasting and more durable parts, it is essential that the coatings be tightly adhered to the surface of the plastic.<br>
It is often desirable, for decorative or functional reasons, to apply a coating over a plastic substrate. For certain substrates it has been difficult to find coating compositions that provide the required adhesion at a reasonable price and with suitable physical properties. It is well-known that it is difficult to obtain good adhesion of paints to olefinic substrates, including thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) substrates and other such modified polyolefin-based materials.<br>
2<br><br>
Due to their relative non-polar nature, TPOs do not readily accept paint. Most paints are polar, and thus require a surface with some degree of polarity before it can adhere to the surface with any degree of desirable fastness.<br>
In the past, this problem has been addressed from number of different directions. One typical and relatively effective method of applying paint to a TPO is to first apply a primer to the TPO before applying the paint. Primers, while being effective, do add an additional step in the finishing of TPO articles.<br>
Commonly, the automobile body external panels are usually coated with multilayer coating film formed from a primer coating composition by electrodeposition coating composition, an anti-chipping primer, an intercoat coating composition and a topcoat for the purpose of imparting anti-corrosive properties and beautiful appearances.<br>
However, the above multilayer coating film generate drawbacks such as collision against the automobile body external panel of the pebbles, gravels, antifreezing agent, lumps of ice, etc, skipped up from on the road while the automobile is in motion and may produce mars on the multilayer coating film, to be extreme, local breakings and falling off of the multilayer coating film, poor coating film appearance, and exposure of the metal substrate, resulting in developing rust and corrosion. To avoid this, halogen free anti-chipping primer is used in the multilayer coating film.<br>
Thermoplastic olefins (TPOs) are uncrosslinked blends of olefin polymers and polyolefin elastomers. They can be made by physically blending in an internal mixer, or by polymerizing in a reactor. These materials are not paintable or coatable, because the paints or coatings consist of polar materials like urethanes, acrylics, epoxies, or melamines that have very poor adhesion to nonpolar materials like polyolefins. Typically, an adhesion promoter is used as the tie layer between the TPO substrate and the paint coating. This extra step adds to the cost of the product, and the coating is not that durable.<br>
3<br><br>
Conventional coloured base coats for car body, which are generally made of polyester, melamine, cellulose acetate butyrate resin ("CAB resin") or acrylic melamine resin, hardly have any adhesion to polyolefinic substrates consisting of so-called crystalline polyolefins with low polarity.<br>
For this reason, paints comprising of modified or copolymerized chlorinated polyolefin containing anhydride are used as colored base coat for the coating on polyolefinic substrates. Though they all have good adhesion to such substrates, these paints are used only for primer coating or 1-coat top coating because of problems such as no hardening, poor adhesion or poor secondary adhesion after washing with water, etc., which are vital problems for coating materials, in the coating made by the method of directly coating a colour base having painting pigment and completing the coating with a single baking, i.e. primerless 2-coat 1-bake system (wet on wet system of coloured base coat and top clear coat).<br>
Moreover, the paints containing modified or copolymerized chlorinated polyolefin containing anhydride which supplied today are mostly of lacquer type or urethane crosslinking with polyisocyanate and of short working life and, therefore, it is practically very difficult to use them by the primerless 2-coat, 1-bake method.<br>
Furthermore, the coated film obtained had a defect of yellowing regarding long-term weatherability and problems such as poor waterproofing, poor chemical resistance, etc. More specifically, they had a problem of producing dechlorination from polyolefinic substrate and modified chlorinated polyolefin containing anhydride, causing yellowing of aluminium pigment and top coat clear, etc.<br>
As an attempt for improving the polyolefinic substrate itself, various trials are being made such as plasma treatment (surface oxidation by oxygen plasma), flame treatment (surface oxidation by flame), ultraviolet ray treatment (furnishing of functionality by ultraviolet ray), etc. as measures for removing trichloroethane (improvement of adhesion). However, those measures also have problems such as unstable adhesion, etc. depending<br>
4<br><br>
upon the kind of polyolefinic substrate (degree of non polarity) and still remain in the study stage. Moreover, while it is possible to improve adhesion by introducing functional group into the polyolefinic substrate, it makes the substrate costly.<br>
Because of such defects, said formation of coated film is still insufficient in commercial value and has therefore not yet put to practical use.<br>
Plastic substrates made from a variety of thermoplastic and thermosetting plastic materials have widely varying surface properties including surface tension, roughness and flexibility, which make it difficult to achieve adequate adhesion of the organic ;.-£oatin&amp;sJ;&amp;._s^^ plastic materials. It is well known that for proper adherence of coatings to some plastic materials, the use of an adhesion promoter or tie coat is advisable.<br>
The application of an adhesion promoter or tie coat is normally an added step in the coating process where the adhesion promoter is usually applied in a thin layer, normally about 0.25 mils (6.25 microns). Typically, adhesion promoters used on TPO plastic surfaces contain chlorinated polyolefins. Some examples of which are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,997,882; 5,319,032: and 5,397,602.<br>
Additionally, flame or corona pretreatment steps can be used to facilitate adequate adhesion of organic coatings to some plastic substrates.<br>
The use of adhesion promoters and corona pretreatments in a coating system used to coat plastic substrates adds complexity and cost to the system. The application of an adhesion promoter usually entails coating the plastic substrate with the promoter, followed by some drying or curing time which increases the time of the entire coating process, and will usually necessitate additional work space.<br>
Accordingly, coating compositions which exhibit excellent adhesion directly to plastic materials such as TPO and RIM without the use of adhesion promoters or tie coats are<br>
5<br><br>
desirable.<br>
Secondly, TPO is relatively soft and it would be desirable to coat the substrate with a coating composition that can offer resistance to marring and scratching. Finally, uncoated or unpainted TPO may have unsatisfactory weathering properties (i.e., may degrade, discolor, or chalk during outdoor exposure) in certain applications, whereas it is known that coatings provide good weathering characteristics to many different substrates. For these reasons, then, it would be desirable to have means of applying a coating composition to an olefinic substrate to provide the properties that are lacking in the uncoated (raw) uncolored or colored substrate.<br>
Plastic substrates may be coated with curable, or thermosettable, coating compositions. Thermosettable coating compositions are widely used in the coatings art, particularly for high-performance primers and topcoats. Color-plus-clear composite coatings have been particularly useful as topcoats for which exceptional gloss, depth of color, distinctness of image, or special metallic effects are desired.<br>
In the past, it has been necessary to include one or more additional separate manufacturing steps to prepare an olefinic substrate for painting so that the coating layer could adhere to the olefinic substrate. According to a frequently used method, a thin layer of an adhesion promoter or tie layer is applied directly to the olefinic substrate. The desired coating layer or layers are then applied over the adhesion promoter. Such adhesion promoters typically include a chlorinated polyolefin. Adhesion promoters with chlorinated polyolefins are expensive to use, often exhibit instability, and, if used in a clear (unpigmented) composition, produce colored, hazy films. In addition, the chlorinated polyolefin materials may produce coatings with poor exterior durability because they are susceptible to degradation when exposed to UV light. Another method that has been used to prepare an olefinic substrate to receive a coating layer is chemical .-.v.-^v. - -■-•---....modification, of^the :substrate.surface,..for. example- by flame or corona pretreatment..-?-.<br>
The plastic parts which are used together with metal parts, especially in the automobile<br>
6<br><br>
industry, frequently receive a paint coating in the same color as that possessed by the other metal parts. At present, these plastic moldings are first provided with a primer and are then painted initially with a basecoat in the desired color and subsequently with a clearcoat. Both solventborne and aqueous paints are available for these purposes. In order to reduce the painting operation by the additional work step of priming, special formulas have been developed for solventborne paints (EP 455 211), which allow adhesion of the paint directly to the plastic surface without an additional primer coat.<br>
JP 5025301 discloses direct coating the surface of a resin molding without surface treatment such as primer coating by heat treating the molding composed of an olefin-based resin and a nonconjugated diene-containing copolymer resin and improving the paint acceptance of the molding surface. After heating gas treatment, a coating material is applied to the surface of a molding of a resin composition obtained by blending 100 pts. wt. olefinic resin (e.g. polypropylene resin) with 0.1-900 pts. wt. block and/or random copolymer resin (e.g. propylene-7-methyi-l,6-octadiene random copolymer) between one or more kinds of alpha-olefms and one or more kinds of nonconjugated dienes to obtain a durable coating film without surface treatment such as primer coating or plasma treatment.<br>
WO2004024839 (equivalent US 2005119400) discloses adhesion additive for an aqueous paint, which comprises at least one binder and/or at least one pigment and/or filler and also at least one halogenated polyolefin (HPO), water, up to 25% by weight of solvents and, if desired, additives customary for aqueous paints. By virtue of the adhesion additive it is possible to apply paint coatings directly to plastic substrates without a primer.<br>
JP 6328638 discloses not only coating a molded form directly with paint such as polyurethane paint, etc., having a low temperature impact resistance, heat resistance, rigidity, etc., sufficient in practical use in a state satisfied in actual use as the form such as an automotive exterior part without special pretreatment or primer treatment but also improve gasohol resistance at the time of using a primer. A sandwich resin composition is made of a core material and a surface layer substantially covering an entire surface of<br>
7<br><br>
the material in such a manner that the layer is formed of a composition containing propylene polymer, modified propylene polymer, ethyl en e-alpha-olefin copolymer rubber and oligomer having a functional group at an end at specific ratio.<br>
JP 8001705 discloses application of paint on the surface of resin member without employing primer treatment by a method wherein molding is performed by mixing modified polypropylene or olefin-based thermoplastic elastomer and olefin-based oligomer having polar group with each other at injection molding. On the surface of the resultant vehicular resin molded article, polyurethane-based paint having ester linkage is applied. In this case, by mixing olefin-based oligomer having polar group with molding resin member, the oligomer tends to appear on the surface of the resin member due to the low molecular weight of the oligomer.<br>
