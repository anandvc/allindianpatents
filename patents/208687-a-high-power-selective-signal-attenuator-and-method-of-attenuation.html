A HIGH-POWER SELECTIVE SIGNAL ATTENUATOR AND METHOD<br>
OF ATTENUATION<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to signal attenuation; and more particularly, a high power selective signal attenuator and method of attenuation.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
Analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have a dynamic range of operation. The dynamic range is defined as the range from minimum signal amplitude to a maximum signal amplitude (i.e., between a minimum and maximum power level). Analog signals having amplitudes within the dynamic range of an ADC will be converted from analog to digital.<br>
Analog signals having amplitudes below the minimum power level of the dynamic range will not undergo conversion, while analog signals having amplitudes greater than the maximum power level of the dynamic range will overload or saturate the ADC.  More specifically, the ADC will clip the amplitude of an analog signal having an amplitude greater than the maximum power level of the ADC's dynamic range. Clipping the amplitude of the analog signal causes harmonics which distort and corrupt the whole spectrum such that most signals are virtually lost. Consequently, such ADCs are unsuitable for many of today's communication needs.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The high-power selective signal attenuator according to the present invention isolates high-power signals in the received analog<br><br>
signal spectrum. The isolated high-power signals are then recombined with the received analog signals such that the high-power signals are substantially canceled from the received analog signals. The isolation of the high-power signals is accomplished by coupling the received analog signals onto a feed forward pathway, and attenuating the coupled signals so that high-power signals fall within the dynamic range of an ADC receiving the attenuator's output. Because the ADC performs the analog-to-digital conversion operation on signals falling within its dynamic range, the output of the ADC substantially represents the high-power signals in the received signals. The digital signals are then digital-to-analog converted and amplified by an amplifier, which compensates for the attenuation caused by at least the attenuator. The resulting signals are then combined 180E out of phase with the received analog signals so that the high-power signals are substantially canceled from the received analog signals.<br>
The attenuation performed by the attenuator in the high-power selective signal attenuator is dynamically controlled by monitoring the output of a primary ADC receiving the output of the high-power selective signal attenuator. As the primary ADC approaches saturation, the attenuation level is increased. As the primary ADC falls further from saturation, the attenuation level is decreased. In this way, the maximum amount of information can be converted by the primary ADC without placing the primary ADC in saturation.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed description given hereinbelow and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of illustration only, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding parts in the various<br><br>
drawings, and wherein:<br>
Fig.   1 illustrates an embodiment of a high-power selective signal attenuator according to the present invention;<br>
Fig.  2A illustrates the coupled signals prior to attenuation; and<br>
Fig. 2B illustrates the coupled signals after attenuation. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Fig.   1 illustrates a high-power selective signal attenuator according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the high-power selective signal attenuator 2 selectively attenuates analog main signals received at an input, and supplies the resulting attenuated main signals to the input of a primary ADC 28. The high-power selective signal attenuator 2 operates based on a clock signal received from a converter clock 4 and control inputs received from control circuitry 32. The control circuitry 32 generates the control imam’s based on processing -performed b3£:.a signal processor 30 on_the output of the primary ADC 28.<br>
As further shown in Fig.   1, the high-power selective signal attenuator 2 includes a primary pathway 6 and a feed forward pathway 8. The primary pathway 6 includes a delay 26 between a first coupler 10 and a second coupler 24. The first coupler 10 couples the main signals on the primary pathway 6 onto the feed forward pathway 8. An attenuator 12 attenuates the signals on the feed forward pathway 8, and a secondary ADC 16 analog-to-digital converts the output of the attenuator 12. A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) 18 converts the output of the secondary ADC 16 to analog, and an amplifier 20 amplifies the output of the DAC 18. The second coupler 24 couples the signals on the feed forward pathway 8 back onto the primary pathway 6.<br><br>
As further shown in Fig. 1 , the high-power selective signal attenuator 2 optionally includes a dither signal generator 34, a third coupler 14, and a dither signal remover 22. The dither signal generator 34 generates a low frequency dither signal at an amplitude controlled by the control circuitry 32, and the dither signal is coupled onto the feed forward pathway 8 by the third coupler 14 disposed after the attenuator 12. The dither signal remover 22 removes the dither signal and is disposed after the amplifier 20. The attenuator 12, the amplifier 20, the delay 26 and the dither signal generator 34 operate based on control inputs received from the control circuitry 32. Furthermore, the secondary ADC 16 and the DAC 18 operate according to a clock signal received from the converter clock 4.<br>
The operation of the high-power selective signal attenuator according to the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in -Fig-will now-be described with reference to Fig,   1 and Figs. 2A-2B. The high-power selective signal attenuator 2 attenuates analog signals having amplitudes greater than the maximum power level of the dynamic range of the primary ADC 28. To do this, analog signals exceeding the maximum power level are isolated by circuitry in the feed forward pathway 8 of the high-power selective signal attenuator 2, amplitude adjusted, and then combined with the main signals on the primary pathway 6 to selectively cancel portions of these high amplitude (i.e., high power) signals from the main signals.<br>
Specifically, the first coupler 10 couples the analog main signals from the primary pathway 6 onto the secondary pathway 8. The attenuator 12 attenuates the coupled signals to an amplitude less than a power-level threshold established by the control circuitry 32. As discussed in more detail below, the control circuitry 32 adjusts the<br><br>
power level threshold of the attenuator 12 such that the amplitudes of the coupled signals exceeding the maximum power level in the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16 fall within the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16. Namely, the power-level threshold is less than or equal to the maximum power level. As a result of this attenuation operation, some signals which fell within the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16 prior to attenuation, will no longer fall within the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16.<br>
The attenuation operation is clearly illustrated in Figs. 2A and 2B. Fig. 2A illustrates the amplitude of coupled signals at frequencies Wl and W2 prior to attenuation. As shown, the amplitude of the coupled signal at frequency Wl falls within the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16, while the amplitude of the coupled signal at frequency W2 exceeds the dynamic range. Fig, 2B illustrates the amplitudes of the  signals at frequencies Wl and: W2 after attenuation. As shown in Fig. 2B, the amplitude of the coupled signal at frequency Wl now falls below the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16, while the amplitude of the coupled signal at frequency W2 now lies within the dynamic range of the secondary ADC 16.<br>
The secondary ADC 16 converts the analog coupled signals into digital signals. Specifically, only those frequencies having amplitudes falling within the dynamic range of the ADC will undergo conversion. As such, frequency W2 will be converted, while frequency Wl will not; hence, the information pertaining to frequency Wl is lost.<br>
Digital signals output by the secondary ADC 16 are converted back to analog by the DAC 18, and the amplitudes of the analog signals output from the DAC 18 are amplified by the amplifier 20. The<br><br>
gain of the amplifier 20 is controlled by the control circuitry 32 so that the amplitude of the signals coupled back onto the primary pathway 6 by the second coupler 24 are substantially equal to the amplitudes of the same signals prior to being coupled onto the feed forward pathway 8 by the first coupler 10. Namely, the amplifier 20 cancels out attenuation of the main signals caused by the first coupler 10, the attenuator 12, the third coupler 14 (if present), the secondary ADC 16, the DAC 18, the dither signal remover 22 (if present) and the second coupler 24. Because the power-level threshold of the attenuator 12 dynamically changes, the control circuitry 32 dynamically changes the gain of the amplifier 20 in association therewith.<br>
As discussed above, the second coupler 24 then couples the output of the amplifier 20 back onto the primary pathway 6 such that the signals coupled from the feed forward pathway 8 onto the primary =pathway~6 are~180^E^out of"phaserwith the main signals on the primary pathway 6. Depending upon phase differences generated by the components on the feed forward pathway 8, (including the first and second couplers 10 and 24), the delay 26 delays the main signal to establish a phase difference of 180E between the signals being coupled onto the primary pathway 6 by the second coupler 24 and the main signals output from the delay 26 on the primary pathway 6.<br>
Because the signals being coupled onto the primary pathway 6 mostly include the high power signals, which are 180E out of phase with the high power signals in the main signals, these high-power signals are substantially canceled from the main signals.<br>
Next, the optional dither signal generation will be described followed by a description of the dynamic control of the high-power selective signal attenuator 2 by the control circuitry 32.<br><br>
The use of a dither signal to improve the operation of ADC is well-known in the art. Therefore, the conceptual underpinning behind the use of dither signals will not be described. Instead, only the insertion and removal of the dither signal in the high-power selective signal attenuator 2 will be described. As shown in Fig.   1, the dither signal generator 34 generates a low frequency dither signal at an amplitude controlled by the control circuitry 32 as described below, and the dither signal is coupled onto the feed forward pathway 8 by a third coupler 14. The addition of the dither signal influences and improves the operation of the secondary ADC 16. After the analog signal output from the DAC 18 is amplified by the amplifier 20, the dither signal remover 22 removes the dither signal from the feed forward pathway 8.  In this manner, the operation of the secondary ADC 16 is improved.<br>
While the power-level threshold of the attenuator 12 and the. gain of the amplifier 20 could be set to fixed values, the main signals for conversion from analog-to-digital by the primary ADC 28 change over time, and could eventually cause saturation of the primary ADC 28 absent some type of dynamic control of the attenuation operation performed by the high-power selection signal attenuator 2, By monitoring the output of the primary ADC 28, it is determined whether or not the output of the high-power selective signal attenuator 2 is approaching levels which would cause saturation of the primary ADC 28, or alternatively, fall to such levels that the primary ADC 28 is failing to convert a substantial amount of the information in the main signals.<br>
To dynamically control the operation of the high-power selective signal attenuator 2, a signal processor 30 performs a frequency<br><br>
analysis on the output of the primary ADC 28.  For instance, the signal processor 30 performs a fast Fourier transform (FFT) on the output of the primary ADC 28 and sums the power in the various frequency bins of the FFT to obtain a total power. The control circuitry 32 includes an empirically determined lookup table to map the total power to a desired power-level threshold for the attenuator 12, gain for the amplifier 20, and optionally, amplitude of the dither signal. One skilled in the art will readily appreciate from the foregoing example that many different types of analysis can be performed on the output of the primary ADC 28 to determine whether or not the primary ADC 28 is approaching saturation or, in the opposite, so far from saturation that the main signals can be amplified to increase the amount of information falling within the dynamic range of the primary ADC 28.<br>
Besides the power-level threshold of the attenuator 12, the delay through the delay 26 affects how well high power signals are cancelled from the main signals. The time it takes to process signals through the feed forward pathway 8 varies with the frequency of the signals being processed. Accordingly, the phase difference between the signals coupled onto the primary pathway 6 by the second coupler 24 and the signals on the primary pathway 6 output by the delay 26 can deviate from 180 degrees and cause imperfect cancellation. This can result in the primary ADC 28 approaching saturation.<br>
Therefore, in addition to dynamic control of the attenuator 12 and the amplifier 20, the control circuitry 32 dynamically controls the delay through the delay 26. In one embodiment, the control circuitry 32 receives the FFT performed by the signal processor 30, and identifies a frequency bin having a power level exceeding a<br><br>
predetermined threshold indicating that the primary ADC 28 is approaching saturation. The control circuitry 32 then incrementally increases the delay through the delay 26, and monitors the power for the identified frequency bin after each increment. If the power in the identified frequency bin decreases, the control circuitry 32 continues incrementing the delay through the delay 26 until there is no longer a decrease in the power of the identified frequency bin. If, instead of a decrease, incrementing the delay through the delay 26 causes an increase in the power of the identified frequency bin, the control circuitry 32 begins incrementally decreasing the delay through the delay 26. If the power in the identified frequency bin decreases, the control circuitry 32 continues decreasing the delay through the delay 26 until there is no longer a decrease in the power of the identified frequency bin. If decreasing the delay through the delay 26 also fails to cause a decrease in the power of the identified frequency bin, the control circuitry 32 restores the delay through the delay 26 to the initial value prior to attempting dynamic control.<br>
A similar operation can also be performed with respect to the gain of the amplifier 20 to account for inaccuracies in the correlation between the gain of the amplifier and the attenuation caused by the other elements in the feed forward pathway 8.<br>
The control circuitry 32 can perform dynamic control of the attenuator 12 (and in conjunction, the amplifier 20), the delay 26, and the amplifier 20 sequentially, in parallel, at different time intervals, etc. It is expected that each individual designer will make use of the dynamic control functions in different ways to optimize the performance of the system being designed.<br>
As demonstrated above, the high-power selective signal<br><br>
attenuator according to the present invention attenuates high-power signals so that an ADC connected thereto will not be placed in saturation. Additionally, the high-power selective signal attenuator is dynamically controlled so that the maximum amount of information is transferred to the ADC without placing the ADC in saturation.<br>
