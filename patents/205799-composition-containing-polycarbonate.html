THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"COMPOSITION CONTAINING POLYCARBONATE"<br>
BAYER   AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,       a   German   company   of   D-51368, Leverkusen, Germany<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The present invention relates to polycarbonate compositions filled with talc which, in addition to excellent flame resistance, are distinguished even at small wall thicknesses by improved rigidity, good resistance to stress cracking, i.e. resistance to chemicals, and by low tool abrasion and low coating formation ("juicing") during processing.<br>
Filled or reinforced PC/ABS moulding compositions are known.<br>
EP-A 0 391 413 describes, for example, PC/ABS moulding compositions containing inorganic fillers having particular geometric properties, the moulding compositions being specified by a. relatively low linear thermal expansion coefficient, high strength under impact loading, and a high dimensional stability under heat. Talc and uncalcined clay materials are described as fillers according to the invention. Flameproofing agents are mentioned only generally in a group of additives.<br>
In EP-A 0 452 788 mere are described talc-containing PC/ABS moulding compositions which are distinguished especially by a matt surface of the material. Here too, flameproofing agents are mentioned only generally.<br>
Filled or reinforced PC/ABS moulding compositions which have been rendered flame-resistant are also already known.<br>
JP-A 0 219 9162 describes reinforced, flame-resistant PC/ABS moulding compositions provided with a halogen-containing flameproofing agent having a halogen content of from 0.5 to 15 wt.%. Talc is mentioned generally as a possible filler.<br><br><br>
EP-A 0 363 608 and EP-A 0 640 655 relate to PC/ABS moulding compositions which have been rendered flame-resistant by oligophosphoric acid esters or mixtures of oligo- and mono-phosphoric acid esters. It is mentioned in general that the moulding compositions may contain reinforcing materials. Examples of reinforced moulding compositions are not disclosed, however.<br>
WO 99/07778 describes reinforced PC/ABS moulding compositions which have been rendered flame-resistant by organic phosphorus compounds, the polycarbonate content of those moulding compositions being a mixture of two aromatic polycarbonates having different solution viscosities. Only the use of glass fibres as reinforcing agent is demonstrated by means of examples. Those lead to undesirable tool abrasion during processing of the moulding composition. WO 99/07778 teaches that PC/ABS moulding compositions having a better modulus of elasticity, notched bar impact strength and processing properties are obtained when particular mixtures of polycarbonates of different viscosities are used.<br>
In EP-A 0 754 531 it is mentioned that the use of fibrous fillers having a high L/D ratio leads to products having anisotropic properties (tensile strength, rigidity, linear thermal expansion coefficient, shrinkage ratio), which often has undesirable consequences such as warping, deformation on heating, etc.. There is described a PC/ABS moulding composition which has been rendered flame-resistant by the use of particular oligophosphoric acid esters and reinforced by a filler having a lamellar structure. Examples containing glass flakes, micas and mixtures thereof as filler are disclosed in particular. Talc is not mentioned explicitly as a filler. EP-A 754 531 teaches that the described moulding compositions are distinguished by low deformation in the case of variations in temperature, allowing them to be used for high-precision components. Further advantages mentioned are a low tendency towards bleeding of the flameproofing agent and towards the formation of a coating in the injection-moulding tool.<br><br><br>
JP-A 0 731 6411 describes PC/ABS moulding compositions which contain from 1 to 30 % of an aromatic monophosphate as flameproofmg agent and from 1 to 20 % of a calcined talc having an average particle size of 2 μm or less as filler. The moulding compositions are distinguished by good processability, strength and dimensional stability under heat as well as by excellent flame protection. Experience teaches, however, that monophosphates tend to bleed and to form undesirable coatings on the tools during processing by injection moulding.<br>
US-A 5,849,827 and WO 99/07788 disclose flame-resistant thermoplastic moulding compositions, based on polycarbonate, which contain very finely divided inorganic powders. Talc is not mentioned. It is described that, by the addition of the finely divided inorganic powders, the after-burning times at 1.6 mm according to UL 94 V, and hence the flameproofmg properties, are improved.<br>
The object of the present invention is to improve the flame resistance (reduction of the after-burning times and dripping tendency in the UL 94 V test) in the case of thin wall thicknesses, especially of 1.5 mm and below, while at the same time increasing the rigidity of the material, which is especially important in the case of thin-walled mouldings. Furthermore, the moulding compositions are to have good resistance to stress cracking, good hydrolytic stability, a low warping tendency, good flowability, dimensional stability under heat and strength and, during processing, negligible tool abrasion and negligible coating formation as a result of bleeding of the flameproofing agent during processing.<br>
It has now been found that impact-modified polycarbonate compositions which contain the particular talc described below have the desired properties. The profile of properties of the compositions according to the invention especially permits their use in the production of thin-walled mouldings, especially for applications which require reliable flame protection.<br><br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides polycarbonate compositions containing impact modifier, at least one phosphorus-containing flameproofing agent, and<br>
from 0.05 to 40 parts by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 30 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 20 parts by weight, based on the total composition, of a particular highly pure talc having an MgO content of from 28 to 35 wt.%, preferably from 30 to 33 wt.%, particularly preferably from 30.5 to 32 wt.%, and an Si02 content of from 55 to 65 wt.%, preferably from 58 to 64 wt.%, particularly preferably from 60 to 62.5 wt.%, in each case based on the talc.<br>
Especially preferred types of talc are further distmguished by an AI2O3 content of less than 5 wt.%, especially less than 1 wt.%, more especially less than 0.7 wt.%, based on the talc.<br>
Preference is given to polycarbonate compositions containing<br>
A)	from 40 to 98 parts by weight, preferably from 45 to 95 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 50 to 90 parts by weight, of at least one aromatic polycarbonate,<br>
B)	from 0.5 to 50 parts by weight, preferably from 1 to 35 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 1.5 to 25 parts by weight, of at least one graft polymer,<br>
C)	from 0.5 to 40 parts by weight, especially from 2 to 20 parts by weight, of at least one phosphorus-containing flameproofing agent,<br>
D)	from 0.05 to 40 parts by weight, especially from 0.5 to 30 parts by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 20 parts by weight, of a talc according to the above definition.<br><br><br>
The sum of the parts by weight of all the components (A to D and, optionally, further constituents) is 100.<br>
Very particularly preferred polycarbonate compositions are distinguished especially by the fact that, at wall thicknesses of less than or equal to 1.5 mm, preferably at wall thicknesses of 1.2 mm or less, they pass the UL 94V test with the rating V-0.<br>

The thermoplastic aromatic polycarbonates and polyester carbonates may be used alone or in any desired mixture.<br>
Component B<br>
Component B contains one or more graft polymers of<br>
B.l from 5 to 95 wt.%, preferably from 30 to 90 wt.%, of at least one vinyl monomer with<br>
B.2 from 95 to 5 wt.%, preferably from 70 to 10 wt.%, of one or more graft bases having glass transition temperatures 
The graft base B.2 generally has a mean particle size (d50 value) of from 0.05 to 10μm, preferably from 0.1 to 5 μm, particularly preferably from 0.2 to 1 urn.<br>
Monomers B.l are preferably mixtures of<br>
B.1.1 from 50 to 99 parts by weight of vinyl aromatic compounds and/or vinyl aromatic compounds substituted at the nucleus (such as, for example, styrene, a-methylstyrene, p-methylstyrene, p-chlorostyrene) and/or methacrylic acid (Ci-Cg)-alkyl esters (such as, for example, methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate), and<br>
B.1.2 from 1 to 50 parts by weight of vinyl cyanides (unsaturated nitriles, such as acrylonitrile and metbacrylonitrile) and/or (meth)acrylic acid (Ci-Cg)-aHcyl esters (such as, for example, methyl methacrylate, n-butyl acrylate, tert.-butyl acrylate) and/or derivatives (such as anhydrides and imides) of unsaturated carboxylic acids (for example maleic anhydride and N-phenyl-maleimide).<br><br><br>
Preferred monomers B.l.l are selected from at least one of the monomers styrene, a-methylstyrene and methyl methacrylate; preferred monomers B. 1.2 are selected from at least one of the monomers acrylonitrile, maleic anhydride and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Particularly preferred monomers are B. 1.1 styrene and B. 1.2 acrylonitrile.<br>
Suitable graft bases B.2 for the graft polymers B are, for example, diene rubbers, EP(D)M rubbers, that is to say those based on ethylene/propylene and optionally diene, acrylate, polyurethane, silicone, chloroprene and ethylene/vinyl acetate rubbers.<br>
Preferred graft bases B.2 are diene rubbers (for example based on butadiene, isoprene, etc.) or mixtures of diene rubbers or copolymers of diene rubbers or mixtures thereof with other copolymerisable monomers (for example according to B. 1.1 and B. i .2), with the proviso that the glass transition temperature of component B.2 is below 
Special preference is given to pure polybutadiene rubber.<br>
Particularly preferred polymers B are, for example, ABS polymers (emulsion, mass and suspension ABS), as are described, for example, in DE-OS 2 035 390 (= US-PS 3 644 574) or in DE-OS 2 248 242 (= GB-PS 1 409 275) or in Ullmann, Enzyklopadie der Technischen Chemie, Vol. 19 (1980), p. 280 ff. The gel content of the graft base B.2 is at least 30 wt.%, preferably at least 40 wt.% (measured in toluene).<br><br><br>
The graft copolymers B are prepared by free-radical polymerisation, for example by emulsion, suspension, solution or mass polymerisation, preferably by emulsion or mass polymerisation.<br>
Particularly suitable graft rubbers are also ABS polymers which are prepared by redox initiation using an initiator system of organic hydroperoxide and ascorbic acid according to US-P 4 937 285.<br>
Since it is known that the graft monomers are not necessarily grafted on to the graft base completely in the graft reaction, graft polymers B are also to be understood according to the invention as being products that are obtained by (co)polymerisation of the graft monomers in the presence of the graft base and that are also obtained during working up.<br>
Suitable acrylate rubbers according to B.2 for the polymers B are preferably polymers of acrylic acid alkyl esters, optionally with up to 40 wt.%, based on B.2, of other polymerisable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers. The preferred polymerisable acrylic acid esters include C1-C5-alkyl esters, for example methyl, ethyl, butyl, n-octyl and 2-ethylhexyl esters; haloalkyl esters, preferably halo-C1-C8-alkyl esters, such as chloroethyl acrylate, as well as mixtures of those monomers.<br>
For crosslinking, monomers having more than one polymerisable double bond can be copolymerised. Preferred examples of crosslinking monomers are esters of unsaturated monocarboxylic acids having from 3 to 8 carbon atoms and of unsaturated monohydric alcohols having from 3 to 12 carbon atoms, or of saturated polyols having from 2 to 4 OH groups and from 2 to 20 carbon atoms, such as, for example, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, allyl methacrylate; polyunsaturated heterocyclic compounds, such as, for example, trivinyl and triallyl cyanurate; polyfunctional vinyl compounds, such as di- and tri-vinylbenzenes; and also triallyl phosphate and diallyl phthalate.<br><br><br>
Preferred crosslinking monomers are allyl methacrylate, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, diallyl phthalate and heterocyclic compounds having at least three ethylemcally unsaturated groups.<br>
Particularly preferred crosslinking monomers are the cyclic monomers triallyl cyanurate, triallyl isocyanurate, triacryloylhexahydro-s-triazine, triallyl benzenes. The amount of crosslinking monomers is preferably from 0.02 to 5 wt.%, especially from 0.05 to 2 wt.%, based on the graft base B.2.<br>
In the case of cyclic crosslinking monomers having at least three ethylemcally unsaturated groups, it is advantageous to limit the amount to less than 1 wt.% of the graft base B.2.<br>
Preferred "other" polymerisable, ethylemcally unsaturated monomers which can optionally be used, in addition to the acrylic acid esters, for the preparation of the graft base B.2 are, for example, acrylonitrile, styrene, a-methyistyrene, acrylamides, vinyl C1-C6alkyl ethers, methyl methacrylate, butadiene. Preferred acrylate rubbers as graft base B.2 are emulsion polymers having a gel content of at least 60 wt.%.<br>
Other suitable graft bases according to B.2 are silicone rubbers having graft-active sites, as are described in DE-OS 3 704 657, DE-OS 3 704 655, DE-OS 3 631 540 andDE-OS3 631539.<br>
The gel content of the graft base B.2 is determined at 25°C in a suitable solvent (M. Hoffmann, H. Kromer, R, Kuhn, Polymeranalytik I und D, Georg Thieme-Verlag, Stuttgart 1977).<br>
The mean particle size d50 is the diameter above arid below which in each case 50 wt.% of the particles lie. It can be determined by means of ultracentrifuge<br><br>

Component D<br>
Talc is understood as being a naturally occurring or a synthetically prepared talc.<br>
Pure talc has the chemical composition 3 Mg0-4Si02-H20 and accordingly has an MgO content of 31.9 wt.%, an SiO2 content of 63.4 wt.% and a content of chemically bonded water of 4.8 wt.%.it is a silicate having a layered structure.<br>
Naturally occurring talc materials generally do not have the ideal composition mentioned above, since they are rendered impure by the partial replacement of the magnesium by other elements, by the partial replacement of silicon by, for example, aluminium, and/or by intergrowths with other minerals such as, for example, dolomite, magnesite and chlorite.<br>
The particular types of talc within the scope of the invention are distinguished by an especially high purity, characterised by an MgO content of from 28 to 35 wt.%, preferably from 30 to 33 wt.%, particularly preferably from 30.5 to 32 wt.%, and an Si02 content of from 55 to 65 wt.%, preferably from 58 to 64 wt.%, particularly preferably from 60 to 62.5 wt.%. Preferred types of talc are further distinguished by<br><br><br>
an A1203 content of less than 5 wt.%, particularly preferably less than 1 wt.%, especially less than 0.7 wt.%.<br>
Commercially available types of talc which correspond to that definition are, for example, Naintsch A3, A7, A10, A30 and Naintsch Prever M30 from Naintsch Mineralwerke GmbH (Graz, Austria), and the types Finntalc M05SL, M03 and M20SL which are marketed by Omya GmbH (Cologne).<br>
Types of talc which are not within the scope of the invention are, for example, Naintsch SE-Standard, Naintsch SE-Super, Naintsch SE-Micro and Naintsch ST 10, 15,20,30 and 60, all of which are marketed by Naintsch Mineralwerke GmbH.<br>
The use of the talc according to the invention in the form of finely ground types having a mean largest particle size d50 of 
The talc can be surface-treated, for example silanised, in order to ensure better compatibility with the polymer. With regard to the processing and preparation of the moulding compositions, the use of compacted talc is also advantageous.<br>

The compositions according to the invention may contain as anti-dripping agents preferably fluorinated polyolefins E.l in an amount of up to 3 parts by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 1 part by weight, based on the total composition.<br><br><br>
Fluorinated polyolefins are generally known (see, for example, EP-A 640 655). A commercially available product is, for example, Teflon® 30 N from DuPont.<br>
The fluorinated polyolefins may also be used in the form of a coagulated mixture of emulsions of the fluorinated polyolefins with emulsions of the graft polymers B) or with an emulsion of a copolymer preferably based on styrene/acrylonitrile, the fluorinated polyolefin in the form of an emulsion being mixed with an emulsion of the graft polymer or copolymer and subsequently coagulated.<br>
The fluormated polyolefins may also be used in the form of a pre-compound with the graft polymer B or with a copolymer preferably based on styrene/acrylonitrile. The fluorinated polyolefins are mixed in the form of a powder with a powder or granulate of the graft polymer or copolymer and are compounded in the melt generally at temperatures of from 208 to 330°C in conventional apparatuses such as internal kneaders, extruders or double-shaft screws.<br>
The fluorinated polyolefins may also be used in the form of a masterbatch, which is prepared by emulsion polymerisation of at least one monoethylenically unsaturated monomer in the presence of an aqueous dispersion of the fluorinated polyolefin. Preferred monomer components are styrene, acrylonitrile and mixtures thereof. The polymer is used in the form of a pourable powder after acid precipitation and subsequent drying.<br>
The coagulates, pre-compounds and masterbatches usually have solids contents of fluormated polyolefin of from 5 to.95 wt.%, preferably from 7 to 60 wt.%.<br>
The compositions according to the invention may also contain further polymers.<br>

The (copolymers E.2 are resin-like, thermoplastic and rubber-free.<br>
Particular preference is given to the copolymer of E.2.1 styrene and E.2.2 acrylonitrile.<br>
The (copolymers according to E.2 are known and can be prepared by free-radical polymerisation, especially by emulsion, suspension, solution or mass polymerisation. The (copolymers according to component E.2 preferably have molecular weights Mw (weight average, determined by light scattering or sedimentation) of from 15,000 to 200,000.<br><br><br>
Also suitable are polyalkylene terephthalates (E.3) such as are described in EP-A-841 187.<br>
Preference is given to polyalkylene terephthalates which have been prepared from terephthalic acid and/or reactive derivatives thereof (e.g. dialkyl esters thereof) and ethylene glycol and/or 1,4-butanediol, and mixtures of those polyalkylene terephthalates.<br>
The compositions according to the invention preferably contain vinyl (copolymers, polyalkylene terephthalates or mixtures thereof up to an amount of 30 wt.%, preferably up to 15 wt.%, based on the total composition.<br>

The mouldmg compositions according to the invention containing the above-mentioned components and, optionally, additives are prepared by mixing the respective constituents in a known manner and melt-compounding or melt-extruding them at temperatures of from 200°C to 300°C in conventional apparatuses such as internal kneaders, extruders and double-shaft screws.<br>
The individual constituents may be mixed in a known manner either in succession or simultaneously, either at approximately 20°C (room temperature) or at a higher temperature.<br>
Owing to their excellent flame resistance and their good other properties, such as, for example, ESC behaviour (resistance to stress cracking), rigidity, dimensional stability under heat, flowability and lack of warping, the thermoplastic moulding<br><br><br>
compositions according to the invention are suitable for the production of moulded bodies of any kind, especially of thin-walled parts having increased requirements as regards flame resistance.<br>
The moulded bodies can be produced, for example, by injection moulding or extrusion. Examples of moulded bodies which can be produced are: casing parts of any kind, for example for domestic appliances, such as juice extractors, coffee machines, mixers; for office equipment, such as monitors, (portable) computers, printers and copiers. Other possible fields of apphcation are covering plates and electrical installation channels for the construction sector as well as parts for the motor vehicle sector. The moulding compositions can also be used in the field of electrical engineering, for example for switches, sockets and circuit boards.<br>
The invention relates also to a process for the preparation of the composition, to the use of the composition in the production of moulded bodies, and to the moulded bodies themselves.<br><br>

Preparation and testing of the moulding compositions according to the invention<br>
Components A to E are mixed in a 3 litre kneader. The moulded bodies are produced on an Arburg 270E injection-moulding machine at 240°C.<br>
The stress cracking behaviour is tested on rods measuring 80 x 10x4 mm. The test medium used is a mixture of 60 vol.% toluene and 40 vol.% isopropanol. The test specimens are pre-expanded by means of a circular arc template (pre-extension from 1.2 to 2.4 %) and stored in the test medium at room temperature for 5 minutes.<br>
The stress cracking behaviour is assessed by means of the flexural elongation which at least is necessary for the rod to break within the 5-rhimite exposure time in the test medium.<br>
The flame resistance is determined according to UL94V on rods having a thickness of 1.2 mm.<br>
The tensile modulus is measured according to ISO 527/DIN 53 457.<br><br><br>
Table 1<br>
Composition and properties<br><br>
* Comparison test<br><br>
Continuation of Table 1<br><br>
n.b. = not broken<br><br>
It will be seen from Table 1 that by using highly pure types of talc (Examples 1 to 5), improved flame resistance at a wall thickness of 1.2 mm (reduced after-burning times as well as a reduced dripping tendency) and a higher modulus of elasticity are achieved than when other types of talc are used in the same concentration (Comparisons 1 and 2). Only with highly pure talc is a V-0 rating achieved in the UL94V test at a wall thickness of 1.2 mm. The moulding compositions are further distinguished by an unusually good resistance to stress cracking. The nature of the PTKE preparation used has only a negligible effect on those properties (Examples 2 and 3). The effect is found with various phosphorus-containing flameproofing agents.<br>
As the concentration of talc increases, the after-burning times are initially increasingly reduced within certain limits, which depend on the composition in question and on the nature of the flameproofing agent (Examples 3 and 6 to 8). The modulus of elasticity rises linearly with the talc content, an increase in the modulus of elasticity of up to 0.15 GPa per 1 wt.% of added talc being achieved in the case of highly pure types of talc, whereas markedly smaller increases in the modulus of elasticity are observed when other types of talc are used (Comparisons 1 and 2).<br>
Even with very low talc contents of, for example, 1 wt.% it is possible, in combination with different phosphorus-containing flameproofing agents, to achieve a V-0 rating in the UL94V test at a wall thickness of L2 mm, and a marked improvement in the ESC behaviour (Examples 7, 8, 12 and 13). Comparison of Example 12 with Comparison 3 or Example 13 with Comparison 4 shows the positive effect of the talc on the flame resistance (after-burning time and dripping tendency) and on the resistance to stress cracking and the rigidity of the moulding composition. By using low concentrations of talc, for example from 1 to 5 wt.%, it is possible to prepare moulding compositions which have excellent flame resistance and a balance between increased rigidity and high strength, as well as very good ESC behaviour.<br><br><br>
A V-0 rating in the UL94V test at a wall thickness of 1.2 mm is obtained, in combination with various phosphonis-containing flameproofing agents, also in the case of high talc contents of, for example, from 10 to 20 wt.% (for example, Examples 9 and 11). Those moulding compositions having a high talc content are distinguished by their excellent flame resistance and especially high rigidity, while at the same time being surprisingly high in strength.<br>
If C.l (bisphenol-A-based phosphate) is used as the phosphonis-containing flameproofing agent, an especially good ESC behaviour is obtained as compared with the resorcinol-based phosphate (C.2) especially in the case of low talc contents of, for example, less than or equal to 3 wt.% (Examples 7 and 8 and 12 and 13). However, even in the case of the resorcinol-based phosphate (C.2), an improvement in the ESC behaviour is achieved by the addition of talc (Examples 7 and 8).<br>
The described positive effect of the particular talc on the flame resistance is observed both when only one polycarbonate is used and when a mixture of several polycarbonates of different solution viscosities is used (Examples 7, 8,12 and 13).<br>
The effect is observed also when mass ABS (Example 14) or mixtures of mass and emulsion ABS (Example 15) are used as impact modifier.<br><br><br>
