				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR SENSORLESS POSITION CONTROL<br>
OF A PERMANENT MAGNET SYNCHRONOUS MOTOR (PMSM)<br>
DRIVE SYSTEM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to control systems and<br>
power inverter modules, and, more particularly, to control systems, methods<br>
and apparatus for control of a PMSM drive system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] An electric traction drive system typically includes a power<br>
inverter module (PIM) and an AC motor.<br>
[0003] Many common sensorless position control methods of a traction<br>
drive systems either rely on spatial variation of rotor saliency of a rotor of the<br>
drive system or Back EMF of the inherent saliency machine of the drive<br>
system. These methods are more suitable with Interior Permanent Magnet<br>
Synchronous Motor (IPMSM), Synchronous Reluctance Motor and Switched<br>
Reluctance Motor machine types which inherently have magnetically salient<br>
rotors.<br>
[0004] Other methods of detecting rotor angular position include high<br>
frequency signal injection and modified PWM test pulse excitation.<br>
[0005] In the high frequency signal injection method, a balanced high<br>
frequency test signal, such as a voltage or current signal, can be injected on a<br>
stator winding of an inherently salient machine and the resultant effect of the<br>
balanced high frequency test signal on stator current can be measured. The<br>
effect of the balanced high frequency test signal injection can be observed in a<br>
measured stator current which takes the form of amplitude modulation at two<br>
times the fundamental frequency rate. This effect is due to the spatial<br>
modulation of the magnetic saliency as the rotor rotates. This method works<br>
quite well when the machine under test has inherent saliency, such as an<br><br>
Interior Permanent Magnet type machine. However, Surface Mount<br>
Permanent Magnet (SMPM) machines have no saliency and therefore require<br>
a very high magnitude injection signal in order to retrieve the position<br>
information. Thus, due to additional losses and noise generated by such a high<br>
magnitude injection signal, this method is not suitable for SMPM type<br>
application.<br>
[0006] In the modified PWM test pulse excitation method, modified PWM<br>
test pulses can be used to excite the high frequency impedance of the machine.<br>
When PWM test pulses are injected, the current control is ignored for the test<br>
period. This can be a good method for an industrial drive. However, a<br>
traction machine has low inductance and not controlling current during test<br>
period may result in an uncontrolled condition. This technique retrieves the<br>
position information from sensed stator current which must be sampled<br>
immediately after injecting the test pulses. This increases number of times the<br>
stator current is being sampled.<br>
[0007] According to another method of rotor position estimation discussed<br>
in European patent # EP 0962045 Bl, the resultant effect of modified PWM<br>
test pulses on leakage inductances can be measured via a measured phase to<br>
neutral voltage of an induction machine. This technique utilizes the property<br>
of a squirrel cage type rotor construction in an induction machine. By<br>
injecting the PWM test pulses, the "mechanical" saliency induced due to the<br>
rotor bars of the induction machine can be utilized. A saliency image rotates as<br>
the rotor rotates and this information can be used to deduce rotor position<br>
information.<br>
[0008] However, magnetic saliency is not a feature of a Surface Mount<br>
Permanent Magnet Motor (SMPMM). Thus, position sensorless control for a<br>
SMPMM can be challenging.<br>
[0009] A high performance permanent magnet ("PM") machine drive<br>
system requires an absolute position sensor which is an expensive component.<br>
Moreover, the circuitry required to process its signals can also be expensive.<br>
It would be desirable to eliminate this position sensor. It would also be<br>
desirable to eliminate mechanical interface hardware, reduce cost and weight,<br><br>
reduce cost and weight and improve the reliability of an electric traction drive<br>
system. Other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention<br>
will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description and the<br>
appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and<br>
the foregoing technical field and background.<br>

[0030] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description. The word "exemplary" is<br>
used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance, or illustration." Any<br>
embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be<br>
construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments. All of the<br>
embodiments described in this Detailed Description are exemplary<br>
embodiments provided to enable persons skilled in the art to make or use the<br>
invention and not to limit the scope of the invention which is defined by the<br>
claims.<br>
Overview<br>
[0031] Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and<br>
apparatus that allow for generating of zero-sequence voltages based on voltage<br>
commands and a motor output signal.<br>
[0032] It has been observed that the PM (permanent magnet) in rotor and<br>
the stator electric circuit can cause a saturation effect of a stator core due to<br>
the magnetic flux. The saturation affects the inductance of three phase<br>
windings. For example, in an iron-based stator core, the more saturated<br>
winding has a lower inductance. Therefore if the inductance variation of the<br>
three phase winding is measured, stator flux information can be determined.<br>
The stator flux of the permanent magnet synchronous motor is represented in a<br>
stationary reference frame by equation (1), where are d-axis and q-<br>
axis stator flux linkage, respectively, pM is the stator flux linkage of the<br>
permanent magnet, are the d-axis and q-axis stator current, and is<br>
the rotor angle.<br><br><br>
[0033] If the stator current and inductances are known, the rotor-oriented<br>
component of the stator flux can be derived among the total stator flux, and<br>
then the rotor flux angle can be calculated.<br>
[0034] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a simple 2-pole SMPMM in a showing a<br>
configuration of stator windings a, b, c and a PM. FIG. 1 describes the<br>
relation between the stator inductance variation and the zero sequence voltage<br>
which is the sum of the phase to neutral voltages of phase A, B and C of the<br>
motor. For simplicity the 2 pole machine is used for the analysis, however, it<br>
should be appreciated that a similar analysis would apply to higher pole<br>
machines.<br>
[0035] The variation of the stator inductance in the motor depends on the<br>
flux distribution of the PM and the electromagnetic design magnetic design.<br><br>
[0036]	In equations (3)-(5), is the average stator inductance,<br>
a is the coefficient of stator inductance variance, and is a periodic<br>
function with period of 7t. The stator inductances of a SMPMM for example<br>
can be assumed as:<br><br><br>
[0037] To obtain stator inductance variance information, this embodiment<br>
utilizes the zero sequence voltage components. When the three inductances of<br>
phase A, B and C are equivalent, the zero sequence voltage component is zero.<br>
However, if the inductances are not equivalent, it has a value according to the<br>
configuration of the inverter switches. This condition may occur due to the<br>
main flux saturation. The main flux is composed of the stator and the rotor<br>
PM flux. Thus by observing the zero sequence voltage, the rotor position<br>
information can be deduced.<br>
Inverter Switching Configuration<br>
[0038] FIG. 2 is a diagram which illustrates switching vectors and<br>
switching status of switches of a 2-level 3-phase inverter having eight<br>
available switching vectors (Vo ...V7). The zero sequence voltage is<br>
dependent on both the inductance variance and the inverter configuration due<br>
to switching status. Therefore by investigating the zero sequence voltage<br>
profile at each switching status, the appropriate combination can be derived to<br>
produce unbalanced three phase inductances at every switching instance.<br>
[0039] FIGS. 3-8 are circuit diagrams which represent possible three phase<br>
stator w inding configurations of stator windings with respect to the switching<br>
vectors shown in FIG. 2.<br>
[0040] FIG. 3 is a circuit diagram m which represents a three phase stator<br>
winding configuration of stator windings with respect to the switching vector<br>
Vi shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 3, a voltage (Vdc) exists between node a and<br>
node be, an inductance (la) is coupled between node a and node n, an<br><br>
inductance (lb) is coupled between node n and node b, and , an inductance (lc)<br>
is coupled between node n and node c.<br>
[0041] FIG. 4 is a circuit diagram which represents a three phase stator<br>
winding configuration of stator windings with respect to the switching vector<br>
V2 shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 4, a voltage (Vdc) exists between node ab and<br>
node c, an inductance (la) is coupled between node a and node n, an inductance<br>
(lb) is coupled between node n and node b, and an inductance (lc) is coupled<br>
between node n and node c.<br>
[0042] FIG. 5 is a circuit diagram which represents a three phase stator<br>
winding configuration of stator windings with respect to the switching vector<br>
V3 shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 5, a voltage (Vdc) exists between node b and<br>
node ac, an inductance (lb) is coupled between node b and node n, an<br>
inductance (la) is coupled between node n and node a, and an inductance (lc) is<br>
coupled between node n and node c.<br>
[0043] FIG. 6 is a circuit diagram which represents a three phase stator<br>
winding configuration of stator windings with respect to the switching vector<br>
V4 shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 6, a voltage (Vdc) exists between node be and<br>
node a, an inductance (la) is coupled between node n and node a, an inductance<br>
(lb) is coupled between node n and node b, and an inductance (lc) is coupled<br>
between node n and node c.<br>
[0044] FIG. 7 is a circuit diagram which represents a three phase stator<br>
winding configuration of stator windings with respect to the switching vector<br>
V5 shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 7, a voltage (Vdc) exists between node c and<br>
node ab, an inductance (lc) is coupled between node c and node n, an<br>
inductance (la) is coupled between node n and node a, and an inductance (lb) is<br>
coupled between node n and node b.<br>
[0045] FIG. 8 is a circuit diagram which represents a three phase stator<br>
winding configuration of stator windings with respect to the switching vector<br>
V6 shown in FIG. 2. In FIG. 3, a voltage (Vdc) exists between node ac and<br>
node b. an inductance (la) is coupled between node a and node n, an<br>
inductance (lb) is coupled between node n and node b, and an inductance (lc) is<br>
coupled between node n and node c.<br><br><br>
[0048] When the stator phase inductances ( l°l, *,l c) are equivalent, the<br>
sum of equation (11) is zero. However, when the stator inductances are<br>
different due to the saturation effect, the sum of equation (11) will not be zero<br>
and will have the information regarding the inductance variation. Similarly,<br>
the zero sequence voltage due to each voltage vector V2 ...Vs can be<br>
calculated as shown in equations (12) -(16).<br><br><br><br>
three phase-to-neutral voltages is shown as a function ot rotor angle, lhese<br>
voltage waveforms are generated from equations (6) through (8) with 10%<br>
variation of the average inductances (i.e. ° =0.1* s0) and 300V DC link<br>
voltage. The voltage Vs" is the sum of the three phase-to-neutral voltages<br>
resulting due to the voltage vector Vi. The voltages and " are the<br>
sums of three phase-to-neutral voltages resulting from the voltage vectors V3<br>
and V5, respectively. FIG. 9 shows that the small change (i.e. 10%) in the<br>
stator inductance produces a strong voltage signal (±30V). The zero sequence<br>
voltage is directly related to the inductance variance, which is caused by the<br>
V V	V<br>
stator saturation. The zero sequence voltages ( A-s", B-s" and c-s") are<br>
spatially separated by 120° and are of twice the rotor fundamental frequency.<br>
[0051] FIG. 10 is a graph showing a trace of vector (Vsn) which<br>
represents zero sequence voltages (VA sn,VBm andFc m) transformed to d-<br>
and q-axis stationary reference frame with an Alpha component and a Beta<br>
component of the zero sequence voltages plotted in x-y coordinates. In FIG.<br>
10, these three signals are transformed to d-axis and q-axis stationary<br>
reference frame using the transformation as shown in equation (17). The<br><br>
Alpha and Beta component of the zero sequence voltages are plotted in x-y<br>
coordinate in figure 10. The traces periodically rotate along the circle with<br>
small distortion.<br><br>
[0052] FIG. 11 is a graph showing the phase of the vector (Vsn)<br>
represented by flux angle (9EstRaw) in FIG. 10. The flux angle (0EstRaw) is<br>
shown as a function of rotor angle. The flux angle (0EstRaw) is shown in<br>
equation (18).<br><br>
[0053] As shown in FIG. 11, the frequency is twice that of the rotor angle<br>
and the phase is synchronized with the rotor angle. The rotor angle can be<br>
derived using digital signal processing of the phase information. The result<br>
shows that the rotor angle can be estimated by measuring the three zero<br><br>
Implementation of Invention<br>
[0054] FIG. 12 is a block diagram of a control system which implements a<br>
sensorless algorithm using control hardware and an axial flux SMPMM.<br>
However, the same method is also valid for the general 3-phase synchronous<br>
motor, such as Brushless DC Motor (BLDC), Interior Permanent Magnet<br>
Synchronous Motor (IPMSM) and Reluctance Motors.<br>
[0055] The control system comprises a stator current converter 100, a<br>
motor 200, a voltage generator module 220, and an output module 240.<br><br>
[0056] In this implementation, the stator current converter 100 can receive<br>
a torque command (T*e) and generate three-phase sinusoidal voltage<br>
commands (Vap...Vcp). The motor 200 can receive the three-phase sinusoidal<br>

[0058] The output module 240 can receive sampled three-phase zero-<br>
sequence voltages (VA_sn ...VCsn) and generate the final estimated rotor<br>
position angle (6r_est).<br>
[0059] According to one possible non-limiting implementation,<br>

[0061] The torque-to-current mapping module (1) can receive the torque<br>
command (T*e) and generate the d-axis current command (Idse*) and the q-<br>
axis current command (Iqse*). The current-controller module (4) can receive<br>
the d-axis current error and the q-axis current error and generate the d-axis<br>
voltage command (Vdse*) and the q-axis voltage command (Vqse*), wherein<br><br>
the d-axis current error and the q-axis current error comprises a combination<br>
of the d-axis current command (Idse*) and the q-axis current command (Iqse*)<br>
and the synchronous reference frame currents (Iqse, Idse).<br>
[0062] The synchronous-to-stationary conversion module (5) can receive<br>
the d-axis voltage command (Vdse*) and the q-axis voltage command (Vqse*)<br>
and the final estimated rotor position angle (Grest) and generate the three-<br>
phase sinusoidal voltage commands (Va*...Vc*). The space-vector PWM<br>
module (6) can receive the three-phase sinusoidal voltage commands<br>
(Va*...Vc*) and generate switching vectors (Sa...Sc).<br>
[0063] The injection vector generator (10) can generate injection vectors<br>

(Vap...Vcp) which can be converted to resultant stator currents (Ias...Ics).<br>
[0064] The stationary-to-synchronous conversion module (9) can receive<br>
resultant stator currents (Ias...Ics) and (0r_Est) and generate the synchronous<br>
reference frame currents (Iqse, Idse).<br>
[0065] In one implementation, the motor 200 comprises a three-phase<br>
permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) (11) configured to receive the<br>
three-phase sinusoidal voltage commands (Vap...Vcp) and generate a motor<br>
output (Vn).<br>
[0066] In one implementation, the voltage generator module 220<br>
comprises a phase-to-neutral voltage generator (12), a summing junction (13),<br>
and a sampler module (14). The phase-to-neutral voltage generator (12) can<br>

The summing junction (13) can receive the machine phase voltages<br>
(Van...Vcn) and generate the zero-sequence voltage (Vsn). The sampler<br>
module (14) can receive the zero-sequence voltage (Vsn) and generate<br>
sampled three-phase zero-sequence voltages (VAsn ...VCsn).<br><br>
[0067] In one implementation, the output module 240 comprises a three-<br>
to-to converter module (15), an angle calculator module (16), an angle<br>
converter module (17), and an angle calibrator module (18). The three-to-to<br>
converter module (15) can receive the sampled three-phase zero-sequence<br>
voltages (VAsn ...VC_sn) and generate two-phase zero-sequence voltages<br>
(VAlphasn). The angle calculator module (16) can receive two-phase zero-<br>
sequence voltages (VAlpha_sn) and generate angle of the saturation induced<br>
saliency. The angle converter module (17) can receive angle of the saturation<br>
induced saliency and generate rotor position angle (OEstRaw).<br>
[0068] The angle calibrator module (18) can receive rotor position angle<br>
(GEstRaw) and generate the final estimated rotor position angle (0r_est).<br>
Operation of Control System<br>
[0069] The current mapping module (1) is coupled to summer junctions<br>
(2) and (3), which are coupled to a current controller module (4) and receive<br>
the output of the stationary-to-synchronous conversion module (9). Torque<br>
command (T*e) is passed to torque to current mapping module (1) which<br>
generates the d and q axes current commands Idse* and Iqse* respectively.<br>
These current commands are added to the feedback measured current Idse and<br>
Iqse via the summer junctions (2) and (3) respectively. The d and q-axes<br>
current error is fed to current controller module (4) which generates the d and<br>
q-axes voltage commands Vdse* and Vqse* respectively.<br>
[0070] The output voltage commands are processed through synchronous<br>
to stationary conversion module (5) to generate three phase sinusoidal voltage<br>
commands Va*, Vb* and Vc*. The synchronous-to-stationary conversion<br>
module (5) receives inputs from the current controller module (4) and the<br>
angle calibrator module (18), and generates outputs sent to the Space Vector<br>
PWM module (6). The Space Vector PWM module (6) uses the output of the<br>
synchronous-to-stationary conversion module (5) to generate inputs for the<br>
multiplexer module (7) which also receives inputs from the injection vector<br>
generator module (10).<br><br>
[0071] FIGS. 13-15 are a series of graphs showing synthesis of normal<br>
Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) waveform and injecting vectors. It should be<br>
appreciated that there are several different choices in the sequence of the<br>
injecting vectors and the position of injecting vectors. In this example, the<br>
injecting vectors (Sia, Sib and Sic) are positioned at the center of the zero<br>
vector (V7( 1,1,1)) in the SVPWM waveforms. The two complementary<br>
vectors (VI-V4, V3-V5 and V5-V2) are injected sequentially to minimize the<br>
deviation of motor currents.<br>
[0072] FIG. 13 is a graph showing injecting vectors (Sia, Sib and Sic) for<br>
zero sequence voltage measurement. These voltage commands are then<br>
converted to switching states (Sa, Sb and Sc) for phases A, B and C<br>
respectively via Space Vector PWM module (6). FIG. 14 is a graph showing a<br>
normal Space Vector PWM (SVPWM) waveform for current control with<br>
switching states (Sa, Sb and Sc) for phases A, B and C, respectively.<br>
[0073] Referring again to FIG. 12, the multiplexer module (7) generates<br>
inputs for the PWM inverter (8). The multiplexer module (7) modifies these<br>
switching vectors with injection vectors Sia, Sib and. Sic generated by module<br>
(10). The modified switching vectors Sa', Sb' and Sc' are then used to switch<br>
the IGBT switches in PWM inverter (8) to generate three phase sinusoidal<br>
voltage commands. FIG. 15 is a graph showing a synthesized PWM waveform<br>
with modified switching vectors (Sa', Sb' and Sc') used to switch IGBT<br>
switches in PWM inverter to generate three phase sinusoidal voltage<br>
commands.<br>
[0074] Referring again to FIG. 12, the output generated by the PWM<br>
inverter (8) is supplied to the 3-phase permanent magnet synchronous motor<br>
(11) to generate the commanded torque Te* and to the phase-neutral voltage<br>
calculator module (12). The resultant stator currents (las, lbs and Ics) are<br>
sensed, sampled and passed to the stationary-to-synchronous conversion<br>
module (9). The output of the stationary-to-synchronous conversion module<br>
(9) is synchronous reference frame currents (Iqse and Ids6) which are supplied<br>
to the summing junctions (2) and (3) to generate the current errors (Iqse* and<br>
Ids6*).<br><br>
[0075] Machine terminal phase voltages (Van, Vbn and Vcn) are<br>
measured with respect to the neutral point and supplied to the phase-neutral<br>
voltage calculator module (12). The phase-neutral voltage calculator module<br>
(12) receives the output of both the PWM inverter (8) and the 3-phase<br>
permanent magnet synchronous motor (11), and uses these to generate phase<br>
to neutral voltages (Van, Vbn, Vcn) which are provided to the summing junction<br>
(13).<br>
[0076] The summing junction (13) combines the input signals (Van, Vbn,<br>
Vcn) to generate a zero sequence voltage (Vsn). The zero sequence voltage<br>
(Vsn) is supplied to zero sequence voltage sampling module (14). The zero<br>
sequence voltage sampling module (14) samples the zero sequence voltages<br>
for each of the three phases to align the sample with the injected vector. The<br>
zero sequence voltage sampling module (14) samples the zero sequence<br>
voltage (Vsn) according to injecting sequence, and generates three-phase zero<br>
sequence voltages (VAsn, VB_Sn, Vc_sn), which are supplied to a three phase-<br>
to-two phase conversion module (15) for three phase to two phase conversion.<br>
[0077] The three phase-to-two phase conversion module (15) converts the<br>
three-phase zero sequence voltages (VA_Sn, Vssn, Vc_sn) to two-phase voltages<br>
(VAipha.sn, Vseta.sn), which are then passed through to the angle calculator<br>
module (16). The output of module (16) is the angle of the saturation induced<br>
saliency which is of the twice the fundamental frequency. The divider module<br>
(17) converts this signal to the rotor position angle by dividing with 2. The<br>
estimated raw rotor position is passed to an angle calibrator module (18) to<br>
calculate the final estimated rotor position angle 0r_Est.<br>
Experimental Results:<br>
[0078] The proposed sensorless algorithm of FIG. 12 was implemented<br>
and tested using a General Motors prototype traction control hardware which<br>
includes the motor controller and 50 kW axial flux wheel hub motor or<br>
SMPMM. The experimental results are shown in FIGS. 16-19.<br><br>
[0079] FIG. 16 is a graph showing three phase saturation induced (zero<br>
sequence voltage) signals at no load condition when no load torque is applied.<br>
In this example, Vdc=300V, 60 rpm, Width=9us, SampDelay=9uS, Te = 0,<br><br>
[50V/div]. The experimental results shown in FIG. 16 illustrate strong zero<br>
sequence signals which can be used to deduce the rotor position. Thus, robust<br>
rotor position estimation is possible.<br>
[0080] FIG. 17 is a graph showing three phase saturation induced (zero<br>
sequence voltage) signals at a 40% load condition when no load torque is<br>
applied. In this example, Vdc=300V, 60 rpm, Width=9us, SampDelay=9uS,<br>
Te = 200 Nm. Chi: Measured rotor cosition f2.5rad/sec/divl Ch2.3.4:<br><br>
illustrate that even under loaded condition the zero sequence signal strength is<br>
maintained. The test results under loaded condition exhibit additional<br>
harmonic contents which can be eliminated to estimate the second order<br>
harmonic (i.e., saturation induced saliency component) to estimate the rotor<br>
position.<br>
[0081] FIG. 18 is a graph showing measured and estimated rotor position<br>
angles with two phase saturation induced signals at no load condition when no<br>
load torque is applied. In this example, Vdc=300V, 60 rpm, Width=9us,<br>
SampDelay=9uS, Te = 0 Nm, Chi,2: Measured and estimated rotor position<br><br>
showing measured and estimated rotor position angles with two phase<br>
saturation induced signals at full load condition when 100% load torque is<br>
applied. In this example, Vdc=300V, 60 rpm, Width=9us, SampDelay=9uS,<br>
Te = 500 Nm, Chi,2: Measured and estimated rotor position [2.5rad/sec/div],<br>
Ch3,4: VMpha_, and Bttajm [50V/div]. The experimental results shown in<br>
FIGS. 18 and 19, show that under no load and full load conditions the<br>
estimated rotor position signal exhibits excellent performance.<br><br>
