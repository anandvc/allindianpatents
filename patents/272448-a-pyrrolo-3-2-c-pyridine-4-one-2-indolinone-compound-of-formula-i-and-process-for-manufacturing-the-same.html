				<td>Pyrrolo [3,2-c] pyridine-4-one 2-indolinone Protein Kinase Inhibitors<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a series of pyrrolofused six-membered heterocyclic compounds,especially novel 2-(2-oxoindoline-3-ylidene)methyl-6,7-dihydro -lH-Pyrrol[3,2-c]pyridine-4(5H)-one derivatives, methods for their preparation, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and therapeutic use thereof , particularly their pharmaceutical use as protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cellular signal transduction is a fundamental mechanism whereby extracellular stimuli are relayed to the interior of cells and subsequently regulate diverse cellular processes. These signals regulate a wide variety of physical responses in the cell including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and motility. The extracellular signals take the form of a diverse variety of soluble factors including growth factors as well as paracrine, autocrine and endocrine factors. By binding to specific transmembrane receptors, growth factor ligands communicate extracellular signals to the intracellular signalling pathways, thereby causing the individual cell to respond to extracellular signals. Many of these signal transduction processes utilize the reversible process of the phosphorylation of proteins involving specific protein kinases and phosphatases.<br>
Protein kinases (PKs) are enzymes that catalyze the phosphorylation of hydroxy groups on tyrosine, serine and threonine residues of proteins, whereas protein phosphatases hydrolyze phosphate moieties from phosphorylated protein substrates. The converse functions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases balance and regulate the flow of signals in signal transduction processes. The phosphorylation state of a protein can affect its conformation, enzymatic activity, and cellular location, is modified through the reciprocal actions of protein kinases and protein phosphatases. Phosphorylation is an important regulatory mechanism in the signal transduction process and aberrations in the process result in abnormal cell differentiation, transformation and growth. For example, it has been discovered that a cell may become cancerous by virtue of the transformation of a portion of its DNA into an<br>
oncogene. Several such oncogenes encode proteins which are receptors for growth factors, for example tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine kinases may also be mutated to constitutively active forms that result in the transformation of a variety of human cells. Alternatively, the overexpression of normal tyrosine kinase enzymes may also result in abnodal cell proliferation.<br>
There are two classes of Pks, the protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and the serine-threonine kinases (STKs). PTKs phosphorylate tyrosine residue on a protein. STKs phosphorylate serine or/and threonine on a protein. Tyrosine kinases can be of not only the receptor-type (having extracellular, transmembrane and intracellular domains) but the non-receptor type (being wholly intracellular). One of the prime aspects of PTK activity is their involvement with growth factor receptors which are cell-surface proteins. Growth factor receptors with PTK activity are known as receptor tyrosine kinases ("RTKs")- About 90 tyrosine kinases have been identified in the human genome, of which about 60 are of the receptor type and about 30 are of the non-receptor type. These can be categorized into 20 receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families according to the families of growth factors that they bind and into 10 non-receptor tyrosine kinase sub-families (Robinson et al, Oncogene. 2000, 19. 5548-5557). The classification includes the EOF family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EOF, TGFa, Neu and erbB receptors, the insulin family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the insulin and IGF1 receptors and insulin-related receptor (IRR) and the Class III family of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinases, for example the PDGFa and PDGFp receptors, the stem cell factor receptor tyrosine kinase SCF RTK (commonly known as c-Kit), the fins-related tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) receptor tyrosine kinase and the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R) tyrosine kinase, playing critical role in the control of cell growth and differentiation and are key mediators of cellular signals leading to the production of growth factors and cytokines (Schlessinger and Ullrich, Neuron 1992, 9, 383). A partial, non-limiting, list of such kinases includes Abl, ARaf, ATK, ATM, bcr-abl, Blk, BRaf, Brk, Btk, CDK1, CDK2, CDK3, CDK4, CDK5, CDK6, CDK7, CDK8, CDK9, CHK, AuroraA, AuroraB, AuroraC, cfims, c-fms, c-Kit, c-Met, cRafl, CSF1R, CSK, c-Src, EGFR, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, ERK, ERK1, ERK2, Fak, fes, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, Fgr, FLK-4, Fps, Frk, Fyn, GSK, gsk3a, gsk3b, Hck, Chk, Axl, Pim-1, Plh-1, IGF-1R, IKK, IKK1, IKK2, IKK3, INS-R, Integrin-linked kinase, Jak, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, JNK, JNK, Lck, Lyn, MEK, MEK1, MEK2, p38, PDGFR, PIK, PKB1, PKB2, PKB3, PKC, PKCa, PKCb,<br>

Protein kinases have also been implicated as targets in central nervous system disorders such as Alzheimer's (Mandelkow, E. M. et al. FEES Lett. 1992, 314, 315; Sengupta, A. et al. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997, 167,99), pain sensation (Yashpal, K. J. Neurosci. 1995, 15, 3263-72), inflammatoy disorders such as arthritis (Badger, J. Pharmn Exp. Ther. 1996, 279, 1453), psoriasis (Dvir, et al, J. Cell Biol. 1991, 113, 857), bone diseases such as osteoporosis (Tanaka et al, Nature, 1996, 383, 528). cancer (Hunter and Pines, Cell 1994, 79, 573), atherosclerosis (Hajjar and Pomerante, FASEB J. 1992, 6,2933), thrombosis (Salari, FEES 1990,263,104), metabolic disorders such as diabetes (Borthwick, A. C. et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995,210,738), blood vessel proliferative disorders such as angiogenesis (Strawn et al Cancer Res. 1996, 56, 3540; Jackson et al J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998, 284, 687), restenosis (Buchdunger et al, Proc, Nat. Acad. Sci USA 1991, 92, 2258), autoimmune diseases and transplant rejection (Bolen and Brugge, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 1997, 15, 371) and infection diseases such as viral (Littler, E. Nature 1992,358,160), and fungal infections (Lum, R. T. PCX Int Appl., WO 9805335 Al 980212).<br>
RTKs mediated signal transduction is initiated by extracellular interaction with a specific growth factor (ligand), followed by receptor dimerization, transient stimulation of the intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity and phosphorylation. Binding sites are thereby created for intracellular signal transduction molecules and lead to the formation of complexes with a spectrum of cytoplasmic signaling molecules that facilitate the appropriate cellular responses (e.g., cell division, metabolic homeostasis, and responses to the extracellular microenvironment).<br>
With respect to receptor tyrosine kinases, it has been shown also that tyrosine phosphorylation sites function as high-affinity binding sites for SH2 (src homology) domains of signaling molecules. Several intracellular substrate proteins that associate with receptor tyrosine kinases have been identified. They may be divided into two principal groups: (1) substrates which have a catalytic domain; and (2) substrates which lack such domain but serve as adapters and associate with catalytically active molecules. The specificity of the interactions between receptors or proteins and SH2 domains of their substrates is determined by the amino acid residues immediately surrounding the phosphorylated tyrosine residue. Differences in the binding affinities between SH2 domains and the amino acid sequences surrounding the phosphotyrosine residues on particular receptors are consistent with the observed differences in their<br>
substrate phosphorylation profiles. These observations suggest that the function of each receptor tyrosine kinase is determined not only by its pattern of expression and ligand availability but also by the array of downstream signal transduction pathways that are activated by a particular receptor. Thus, phosphorylation provides an important regulatory step which determines the selectivity of signaling pathways recruited by specific growth factor receptors, as well as differentiation factor receptors. Aberrant expression or mutations in the protein tyrosine kinases have been shown to lead to either uncontrolled cell proliferation (e.g. malignant tumor growth) or to defects in key developmental processes.<br>
It has been identified that such mutated and overexpressed forms of tyrosine kinases are present in a large proportion of common human cancers such as the leukaemia, breast cancer, prostate cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) including adenocarcinomas and squamous cell cancer of the lung, gastrointestinal cancer including colon, rectal and stomach cancer, bladder cancer, oesophageal cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer. As further human tumour tissues are tested, it is expected that the widespread prevalence and relevance of tyrosine kinases will be further established. For example, it has been shown that EGFR tyrosine kinase is mutated and/or overexpressed in several human cancers including in tumours of the lung, head and neck, gastrointestinal tract, breast, oesophagus, ovary, uterus, bladder and thyroid.<br>
One subfamily designated the "HER" or "Erb" RTKs, which include EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor), HER2, HER3 and HER4. These RTKs consist of an extracellular glycosylated ligand binding domain, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular cytoplasm catalytic domain that can phosphorylate tyrosine residues on proteins. The enzymatic activity of receptor tyrosine kinases can be stimulated by either overexpression, or by ligand-mediated dimerization. The formation of homodimers as well as heterodimers has been demonstrated for the HER receptor family. An example of homodimerization is the dimerization of HER1(EGF receptor) by one of the EGF family of ligands (which includes EGF, transforming growth factor alpha, betacellulin, heparin-binding EGF, and epiregulin). Heterodimerization among the four HER receptor kinases can be promoted by binding to members of the heregulin (also referred to neuregulin) family of ligands. Such heterodimerization as involving HER2 and HER3, or a HER3 and HER4 combination, results in a significant stimulation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor dimers even though one of the receptors (HER3) is enzymatically inert. The kinase activity of<br>
HER2 has been shown to be activated also by virtue of overexpression of the receptor alone in a variety of cell types. Activation of receptor homodimers and heterodimers results in phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on the receptors and on other intracellular proteins. This is followed by the activation of intracellular signaling pathways such as those involving the microtubule associated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and the phosphatidylinositol3-kinase (PI3 kinase). Activation of these pathways has been shown to lead to cell proliferation and the inhibition of apoptosis. Inhibition of HER kinase signaling has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and survival.<br>
Another RTK subfamily, consists of insulin receptor (IR), insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-1R) and insulin receptor related receptor (IRR). IR and IGF-1R interact with insulin, IGF-I and IGF-IT to form a heterotecramer of two entirely extracellular glycosylated a subunits and two P subunits which cross the cell membrane and which contain the tyrosine kinase domain.<br>
A third RTK subfamily is referred to as the platelet derived growth factor receptor ("PDGFR") group, which includes PDGFRa, PDGFRp, CSFIR, c-Kit and c-fms. These receptors consist of glycosylated extracellular domains composed of variable nllmbers of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain wherein the tyrosine kinase domain is interrupted by unrelated amino acid sequences.<br>
Platelet derived growth factor receptors such as PDGFRa and PDGFRP are also transmembrance tyrosine kinase receptors, Upon binding of the ligand, they form either homodimers (PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB) or heterodimers (PDGF-AB). Follow is the receptor dimerizes, its tyrosine kinase is activated. This leads to downstream signaling and thus may support tumor growth. Mutations in this gene allow for receptor activation independent of ligand binding and appear to be driving forces in oncogenesis. Some tumors can be characterized by mutated PDGFR as a gene markers for therapy such as GIST. An expression of PDGF, the growth factor that activates PDGFR, was observed hi a number of different tumor cell lines, inter alia in mamma, colon, ovarian, prostate carcinoma, sarcoma and glioblastomas cell lines. Among the tumors, brain tumors and prostate carcinoma (including adenocarcinomas and bone metastasis) have found special interest. Interesting data also exist regarding malign gliomes (anaplastic astrocytomas/glioblastomas).<br>
C-Kit is a tyrosine kinase receptor which belongs to the PDGF receptor family and becomes activated upon binding of its ligand SCF (stem-cell factor). The expression pattern of c-Kit has been studied e.g. in a panel of different primary solid<br>
tumors. A strong expression of c-Kit could be found inter alia in sarcoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), seminoma and carcinoids [Weber et al., J. Clin. Oncol. 22(148), 9642 (2004)]. GISTs are non-epithelial tumors, diagnostically separated from other common forms of bowel cancer. Many occur in the stomach, less in the small intestine and still less in the esophagus. Dissemination to the liver, omentum and peritoneal cavity can be observed. GISTS probably arise from Interstitial Cajal Cells (ICC) which normally form part of the autonomic nervous system of the intestine and take part in the control of motility. Most (50 to 80%) of GISTS arise due to c-Kit gene mutation. In the gut, a staining positive for c-Kit/CD117 is likely to be a GIST., Mutations of c-Kit can make c-Kit function independent of activation by SCF, leading to a high cell division rate and possibly genomic instability. Also in mast cell tumors aberrations of c-Kit could be observed, as well as in mastocytosis and associated myeloproliferative syndrome and Urticaria Pigmentosa. An expression and/or aberrations of c-Kit can also be found in acute myeloicanemia (AML) and malign lymphomas. A c-K.it expression can also be demonstrated in small cell bronchial carcinoma, seminomas, dysgerminomas, testicular intraepithelial neoplasias, melanomas, mamma carcinomas, neuroblastomas, Ewing sarcoma, some soft part sarcomas as well as papillary/follicular thyroid carcinoma (see Schutte et al., innovartis 3/200 l).Inherited mutations of the RET (rearranged during transfection) proto-oncogene are e.g. known to be tumorigenic in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) which may lead to pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma and parathyroid hyperplasia/adenoma (see Huang et al., Cancer Res. 60, 6223-6 (2000)). In patients with MEN 2, germ-line mutations of RET and sometimes duplication of a mutant RET allele in trisomy 10 or loss of the wild type RET allele are commonly identified and believed to be activating, i.e. causing ligand-independent dimerization of the receptor.<br>
Another group which, because of its similarity to the PDGFR subfamily, is sometimes subsumed into the later group is the fetus liver kinase ("Flk") receptor subfamily, This group is believed to be made up of kinase insert domain-receptor fetal liver kinase-1 (KDR/FLK-1, VEGFR2), Flk-lR, Flk-4 and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt-1),<br>
A further member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor .family is the fibroblast growth factor ("FGF") receptor subgroup. This group consists of four receptors, FGFR1-4, and seven ligands, FGF1-7. While not yet well defined, it<br>
appears that the receptors consist of a glycosylated extracellular domain containing a variable number of immunoglobin-like loops and an intracellular domain in which the tyrosine kinase sequence is interrupted by regions of unrelated amino acid sequences. Still another member of the tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor family is the vascular endothelial growth factor ("VEGF") receptor subgroup, VEGF is a diraeric glycoprotein similar to PDGF but has different biological functions and target cell specificity in vivo, In particular, VEGFRs are known to be involved in the control of the onset of angiogenesis. As especially solid tumors depend on good blood supply, inhibition of VEGFRs and thus angiogenesis is under clinical investigation hi the treatment.of such tumors, showing promising-results. VEGF is also a major player in leukemias and lymphomas and highly expressed in a variety of solid malignant tumors, correlating well with malignant disease progression. Examples of tumor diseases with VEGFR-2 (KDR) expression are lung carcinomas, breast carcinomas, Non Hodgkin's lymphomas, ovarian carcinoma, pancreatic cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma and melanoma. In addition to its angiogenic activity, the ligand of VEGFR, VEGF, may promote tumor growth by direct pro-survival effects in tumor cells. PDGF is also involved hi angiogenesis, the process of forming new blood vessels that is critical for continuing tumor growth. Normally, angiogenesis plays an important role in processes such as embryonic development, wound healing and several components of female reproductive function. However, undesirable or pathological angiogenesis has been associated with a number of disease states including diabetic retinopathy, psoriasis, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, atheroma, Kaposi's sarcoma and'haemangioma. Angiogenesis is stimulated via the promotion of the growth of endothelial cells. Several polypeptides with in vitro endothelial cell growth promoting activity have been identified including acidic and basic fibroblast growth factors (aFGF and bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). By virtue of the restricted expression of its receptors, the growth factor activity of VEGF, in contrast to that of aFGF and bFGF, is relatively specific towards endothelial cells. Recent evidence indicates that VEGF is an important stimulator of both normal and pathological angiogenesis and vascular permeability. This cytokine induces a vascular sprouting phenotype by inducing endothelial cell proliferation, protease expression and migration which subsequently leads to the formation of capillary tubes that promote the formation of the hyperpermeable, immature vascular network which is the characteristic of pathological angiogenesis. Accordingly, antagonism of the activity of VEGF is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of a number of disease<br>
states that are associated with angiogenesis and/or increased vascular permeability such as cancer, especially in inhibiting the development of tumors.<br>
FLT3 is a member of the type 111 receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family. FLT3 (fins-like tyrosine kinase) is also known as FLk-2 (fetal liver kinase 2). Aberrant expression of the FLT3 gene has inter alia been documented in both adult and childhood leukernias including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), AML with trilineage myelodysplasia (AML/TMDS), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), as well as MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia). Activating mutations of the FLT3 receptor have been found in about 35% of patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), and are ^associated with a poor prognosis. The most common mutation involves an in-frame duplication within the juxtamembrane domain, with an additional 5-10% of patients having a point mutation at asparagine 835. Both of these mutations are associated with constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of FLT3, and result in proliferation and viability signals in the absence of ligand. Patients expressing the mutant form of the receptor have been shown to have a decreased chance for cure. Thus, there is accumulating evidence for a role for hyperactivated (mutated) FLT3 kinase activity in human leukernias and myelodysplastic syndrome.<br>
The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (c-MET or HGFR) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been shown in many human cancers to be involved in oncogenesis, tumor progression with enhanced cell motility and invasion, as well as metastasis (see, e.g., Ma, P.C., Maulik, G., Christensen, J. &amp; Salgia, R. (2003b). Cancer Metastasis Rev, 22, 309-25; Maulik, G., Shrikhande, A., Kijima, T., Ma, P.C., Morrison, P.T. &amp; Salgia, R. (2002b). Cytokine Growth Factor Rev, 13, 41-59). c-MET (HGFR) can be activated through overexpression or mutations in various human cancers including small cell lung cancer (SCLC) (Ma, P.C., Kijima, T., Maulik, G., Fox, E.A., Sattler, M., Griffin, J.D., Johnson, B.E. &amp; Salgia, R. (2003a). Cancer Res, 63, 6272-6281).<br>
c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is encoded by the Met proto-oncogene and transduces the biological effects of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), which is also referred to as scatter factor (SF). Jiang et al, Crit. Rev. Oncol Hematol, 29: 209-248 (1999). c-MET and HGF are expressed in numerous tissues, although their expression is normally confined predominantly to cells of epithelial and mesenchyraal origin, respectively. c-MET and HGF are required for normal mammalian development and have been shown to be important in cell migration, cell proliferation and survival,<br>
morphogenic differentiation, and organization of 3-dimensional tubular structures (e.g., renal tubular cells, gland formation, etc.). In addition to its effects on epithelial cells, HGF/SF has been reported to be an angiogenic factor, and c-MET signaling in endothelial cells can induce many of the cellular responses necessary for angiogenesis (proliferation, motility, invasion).<br>
The c-MET receptor has been shown to be expressed in a number of human cancers. c-Met and its ligand, HGF, have also been shown to be co-expressed at elevated levels in a variety of human cancers (particularly sarcomas). However, because the receptor and ligand are usually expressed by different cell types, c-MET signaling is most commonly regulated by tumor-stroma (tumor-host) interactions. Furthermore, c-MET gene amplification, mutation, and rearrangement have been observed in a subset of human cancers. Families with gennline mutations that activate c-MET kinase are prone to multiple kidney tumors as well as tumors in other tissues. Numerous studies have correlated the expression of c-MET and/or HGF/SF with the state of disease progression of different types of cancer (including lung, colon, breast, prostate, liver, pancreas, brain, kidney, ovaries, stomach, skin, and bone cancers). Furthermore, the overexpression of c-MET or HGF have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis and disease outcome in a number of major human cancers including lung, liver, gastric, and breast. c-MET has also been directly implicated in cancers without a successful treatment regimen such as pancreatic cancer, glioma, and hepatocellular carcinoma.<br>
A more complete listing of the known RTK subfamilies is described in Plowman et al, DN&amp;P 7(6): 334-339 (1994) which is incorporated by reference, including any drawings, as if fully set forth herein.<br>
The non-receptor tyrosine kinases represent a collection of cellular enzymes which lack extracellular and transmembrane sequences. At present, over twenty-four individual non-receptor tyrosine kinases, comprising eleven subfamilies (Src, Frk, Btk, Csk, Abl, Zap70, Fes/Fps, Fak, Jak, Ack and LIMK) have been identified. At present, the Src subfamily of non-receptor tyrosine kinases are comprised of the largest number of PTKs and include Src, Yes, Fyn, Lyn, Lck, Blk, Hck, Fgr and Yrk. The Src subfamily of enzymes has been linked to oncogenesis. A more detailed discussion of non-receptor tyrosine kinases is provided in Bolen, 1993, Oncogen 8: 2025-2031, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The serine/threonine kinases, STKs, like the CTKs, are predominantly mtracellular although there are a few receptor kinases of the STK type. STKs are the<br>
most common of the cytosolic kinases; i.e., kinases that perform their function in that part of the cytoplasm other than the cytoplasmic organelles and cytoskelton. The cytosol is the region within the cell where much of the cell's intermediary metabolic and biosynthetic activity occurs; e.g., it is hi the cytosol that proteins are synthesized on ribosomes.<br>
A further characteristic of hyperproliferative diseases such as cancer is damage to the cellular pathways that control progress through the cell cycle which, in normal eukaryotic cells, involves an ordered cascade of protein phosphorylation. As for signal transduction mechanisms, several families of protein kinases appear to play critical roles in the cell cycle cascade. The most widely studied of these cell cycle regulators is the cyclin dependent kinase family (the CDKs). Activity of specific CDKs at specific times is essential both to initiate and. coordinate progress through the cell cycle. For example, the CDK4 protein appears to control entry into the cell cycle (the GO-GI-S transition) by phosphorylating the retinoblastoma gene product pRb which stimulates the release of the transcription factor E2F from pRb which, in turn, acts to increase the transcription of genes necessary for entry into S phase. The catalytic activity of CDK4 is stimulated by binding to a partner protein, Cyclin D. One of the first demonstrations of a direct link between cancer and the cell cycle was made with the observation that the Cyclin Dl gene was amplified and Cyclin D protein levels increased in many human tumours.<br>
More recently, protein kinases that are structurally distinct from the CDK. family have been identified which play critical roles hi regulating the cell cycle and which also appear to be important in oncogenesis. They include the human homologues of the Drosophila aurora and S. cerevisiae Ipl 1 proteins. The three human homologues of these genes Aurora-A, Aurora-B and Aurora-C encode cell cycle regulated serine-threonine protein kinases that show a peak of expression and kinase activity through G2 and mitosis. Several observations implicate the involvement of human aurora proteins hi cancer, especially Aurora-A and Aurora-B. Abrogation of Aurora-A expression and function by antisense oligonucleotide treatment of human tumour cell lines leads to cell cycle arrest and exerts; an anti-proliferative effect. Additionally, small molecule inhibitors of Aurora-A and Aurora-B have been demonstrated to have an anti-proliferative effect in human tumor cells.<br>
With regard to cancer, two of the major hypotheses advanced to explain the excessive cellular proliferation that drives tumor development relate to functions known to be PK regulated. That is, it has been suggested that malignant cell growth<br>
results from a breakdown in the mechanisms that control cell division and/or differentiation. It has been shown that the protein products of a number of proto-oncogenes are involved in the signal transduction pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation. These protein products of proto-oncogenes include the extracellular growth factors, transmembrane growth factor PTK receptors (RTKs), cytoplasmic PTKs (CTKs) and cytosolic STKs, discussed above. There is a need for small molecule compounds that may be readily synthesized and are potent inhibitors of one or more RTKs, CTKs or STKs that possess anti-tumor cell proliferative activity and as such are useful in treating or ameliorating RTKs, CTKs or STKs mediated, angiogenesis mediated or hyperproliferative disorder'<br>

Furthermore, one may administer the drug in a targeted drug delivery system, for example, in a liposome coated with tumor-specific antibody. The liposomes will be targeted to and taken up selectively by the tumor.<br>
Composition/Formulation<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may be manufactured by processes well known in the art, e.g., by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, lyophilizing processes or spray drying.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for use in the methods of the present invention may be prepared by any methods of pharmacy, but all methods include the step of bringing in association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In particular, pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention may be formulated in conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries which facilitate processing of the active compounds into preparations which can be used pharmaceutically. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen.<br>
Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, patches, syrups, elixirs, gels, powders, magmas, lozenges, ointments, creams, pastes, plasters, lotions, discs, suppositories, nasal or oral sprays, aerosols and the like.<br>
For injection, the compounds of the invention may be formulated in aqueous solutions, preferably hi physiologically compatible buffers such buffers with or without a low concentration of surfactant or cosolvent, or physiological saline buffer. For transmucosal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds can be formulated by combining the active compounds with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well known in the art. Such carriers enable the compounds of the invention to be formulated as tablets, pills,<br>
lozenges, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be made using a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding other suitable auxiliaries if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Useful excipients are, in particular, fillers such as sugars, including lactose, sucrose, mannitol, or sorbitol, cellulose preparations such as, for example, maize starch, wheat starch, rice starch and potato starch and other materials such as gelatin, gum tragacanth, methyl cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl- cellulose, sodium carboxyrnethylcellulose, and/or polyvinyl- pyrrolidone (PVP). If desired, disintegrating agents may be added, such as cross-linked polyvinyl pyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid. A salt such as sodium alginate may also be used.<br>
Dragee cores are provided with suitable coatings. For this purpose, concentrated sugar solutions may be used which may optionally contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, carbopol gel, polyethylene glycol, and/or titanium dioxide, lacquer solutions, and suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures. Dyestuffs or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings for identification or to characterize different combinations of active compound doses.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which can be used orally include push-fit capsules made of gelatin, as well as soft, sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticizer, such as glycerol or sorbital. The push-fit capsules can contain the active ingredients in admixture with a filler such as lactose, a binder such as starch, and/or a lubricant such<br>
as talc or magnesium stearate and, optionally, stabilizers. In soft-.capsules, the active<br>
compounds may be dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils,<br>
liquid paraffin, liquid polyethylene glycols, cremophor, capmul, medium or long chain mono- di- or triglycerides. Stabilizers may be added in these formulations, also.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray using a pressurized pack or a nebulizer and a suitable propellant, e.g., without limitation, dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetra- fluoroethane or carbon dioxide. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be controlled by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and cartridges of, for example, gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated for parenteral administration, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in<br>
unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating materials such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of a water soluble form, such as, without limitation, a salt, of the active compound. Additionally, suspensions of the active compounds may be prepared in a lipophilic vehicle. Suitable lipophilic vehicles include fatty oils such as sesame oil, synthetic fatty acid esters such as ethyl oleate and triglycerides, or materials such as liposomes. Aqueous injection suspensions may contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, sorbitol, or dextran. Optionally, the suspension may also contain suitable stabilizers and/or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds to allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile, pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, using, e.g., conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
In addition to the formulations described previously, the compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. A compound of this invention may be formulated for this route of administration with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for instance, in an emulsion with a pharmacologically acceptable oil), with ion exchange resins, or as a sparingly soluble derivative such as, without limitation, a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
A non-limiting example of a pharmaceutical carrier for the hydrophobic compounds of the invention is a cosolvent system comprising benzyl alcohol, a nonpolar surfactant, a water-miscible organic polymer and an aqueous phase such as the VPD co-solvent system. VPD is a solution of 3% w/v benzyl alcohol, 8% w/v of the nonpolar surfactant Polysorbate 80, and 65% w/v polyethylene glycol 300, made up to volume in absolute ethanol. The VPD co-solvent system (VPD:D5W) consists of VPD diluted 1 : 1 with a 5% dextrose in water solution. This co-solvent system dissolves hydrophobic compounds well, and itself produces low toxiciry upon systemic administration. Naturally, the proportions of such a co-solvent system may<br>
be varied considerably without destroying its solubility and toxicity characteristics. Furthermore, the identity of the co-solvent components may be varied: for example, other low-toxicity nonpolar surfactants may be used instead of Polysorbate 80, the fraction size of polyethylene glycol may be varied, other biocompatible polymers may replace polyethylene glycol, e.g., polyvinyl pyrrolidone, and other sugars or polysaccharides may substitute for dextrose.<br>
Alternatively, other delivery systems for hydrophobic pharmaceutical compounds may be employed. Liposomes and emulsions are well known examples of delivery vehicles or carriers for hydrophobic drugs. In addition, certain organic solvents such as dimethylsulfoxide also may be employed, although often at the cost of greater toxicity.<br>
Additionally, the compounds may be delivered using a sustained-release system, such as semipermeable matrices of solid hydrophobic polymers containing the therapeutic agent. Various sustained-release materials have been established and are well known by those skilled in the art. Sustained-release capsules may, depending on their chemical nature, release the compounds for a few weeks up to over 100 days. Depending on the chemical nature and the biological stability of the therapeutic reagent, additional strategies for protein stabilization may be employed.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions-herein also may comprise suitable solid or gel phase carriers or excipients. Examples of such carriers or excipients include, but are not limited to, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, various sugars, starches, cellulose derivatives, gelatin, and polymers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
Many of the PK modulating compounds of the invention may be provided as physiologically acceptable salts wherein the claimed compound may form the negatively or the positively charged species. Examples of salts in which the compound forms the positively charged moiety include, without limitation, quaternary ammonium (defined elsewhere herein), salts such as the hydrochloride, sulfate, carbonate, lactate, tartrate, maleate, succinate wherein the nitrogen atom of the quaternary ammonium group is a nitrogen of the selected compound of this invention, which has reacted with the appropriate acid. Salts in which a compound of this invention forms the negatively charged species include, without limitation, the sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts formed by the reaction of a carboxylic acid group in the compound with an appropriate base (e.g. sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), etc.)<br>
Dosage<br>
The amount of the active compound administered will be dependent on the subject being treated, the severity of the disorder or condition, the rate of administration, the disposition of the compound and the discretion of the prescribing physician. However, an effective dosage is typically in the range of about 0.001 to about 100 mg per kg body weight per day, preferably about 0.01 to about 35 mg/kg/day, in single or divided doses. For a 70 kg human, this would amount to about 0.07 to about 7000 tag/day, preferably about 0.7 to about 2500 mg/day. In some instances, dosage levels below the lower limit of the aforesaid range may be more than adequate, while in other cases still larger doses may be used without causing any harmful side effect, with such larger doses typically divided into several smaller doses for administration throughout the day.<br>

Biological Assays<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Cell Proliferation Inhibition VEGF-R2 Assay<br>
The following in vitro assay may be used to determine the level of activity and effect of different compounds of the present invention on the proliferation inhibition (cell toxic) of endothelium growth factor receptor (VEGFR) high expressing homo sapient cancer cell-HUVEC cell.<br>
The cellular assay described here measure the compounds of their anti-angiogenesis and proliferation inhibition activity and effect through VVEGFR on the cancer cells in vitro. The effect and activity is represented by the IC50 value that kills the cancer cell. The general procedures for the assay is as follows: The homo sapient cells highly express VVEGFR are chosen and seeded to 96-well cell culture plate at a suitable concentration (exp 5000 cells/ml medium). The cells then are cultured in carbon dioxide (CO2) incubator till when they confluence to about 85 %. Then, the cell culture medium is replaced by fresh one with tested compounds added in it at serial concentrations (general 6 to 7 concentrations). Then the cells are put back to the culture and cultured for continuous 72 hours. 72 hours later, the cell exposed to compounds and control cell are assayed for their proliferation using Sulforhodamine B (SRB) method. Compounds IC50 on tested cells are calculated by the data of inhibition rates of serial concentrations of the tested compounds.<br>

Protocol:<br>
The following protocol is used to assay the cell toxic activity of IC50 value of tested compounds of the invention on HUVEC cell:<br>
1.	Growing HUVEC cells in growth media (DMEM/F12, supplemented with 10 % FBS) in 100 mm corning culture plates till confluence at 37 "C, 5 % CO2.<br>
2.	Wash HUVEC cells in 100 mm plates with PBS, harvest cells by trypsinization and seeded cells to corning 96-well cell culture plates at concentration of 50000 cells/ml, leaving 6 wells/each plate empty as background.<br>
3.	Growing seeded 96-well plates at 37 °C, 5 % CO2, till 85 % confluence.<br>
4.	Prepare compounds stock solution, using DMSO solve candidate compounds to a concentration of 20 mM. Then use DMSO to dilute the stock solution to a serious concentration of tested compounds solution (namely, 2 mM, 1 mM, 0.2 mM, 20 uM, 2 uM, 0.2 uM).<br>
5.	Use cell culture medium (in this case, DMEM/F12 +10 % FBS) to dilute the compounds solution prepared above. Each DMSO serial concentration compound solution is diluted by 20 times with culture medium by adding 5 ul DMSO compound solution to 95 ul culture medium, then mix well by vortex. This promise that the DMSO concentration at that the HUVEC cell will exposed to will not surpass 0.5 %.<br>
6.	After HUVEC cell has attached to the dish bottom and confluence about 85 %,<br>
change the culture medium with fresh DMEM/F12 plus 10 % FBS. Each well added 180 µl medium, then add 20 ul medium solution of tested compounds prepared at step 5 to each well. For control group cell, add 20 ul culture medium containing 0.5 % pure DMSO. So, now HUVEC cells are exposed to each tested compound at a serial final concentration of 100 µM, 10 uM, 5 uM, 1 uM, 0.1 uM, 0.01 uM, and 0.001 uM. Each 96-well plate, we can test 3 compounds with a control cell group.<br>
7.	Put the culture plates back to incubator, culture for 72 hours at 37 °C, 5 % CO2.<br>
8.	72 hours later, remove cultures from incubator into sterile work area.<br>
9.	Prepare fixative (50 %-Trichloroacetic Acid-TCA) by adding reagent grade water to the TCA, fix the cells by gently layering 50 µl of cold TCA solution on top of the growth medium.<br>
10.	Incubate plates for 1 hour at 4 °C and then rinse with water several times to remove TCA, serum proteins, etc. Plates are air dried and stored until use. Bland background optical density is measured in wells incubated with growth medium without cells.<br>
11.	Use 10 % acetic acid solution to prepare 0.4 % Sulforhodamine B solution. Add 50 ul sulforhodamine B solution to each well of 96-well plates.<br>
12.	Allow cells to stain for 30 minutes.<br>
13.	Prepared the wash solutionof 10 % acetic acid. At the end of the staining period, the stain is removed and the cells rinsed quickly with 1 % acetic acid. Repeat until unincorporated dye is removed. Keep wash times to a minimum to reduce desorption of protein-bound dye. After being rinsed, the cultures are air dried until no moisture is visible.<br>
14.	The incorporated dye is then solubilized in a volume of Sulforhodamine B assay Solubilization solution (10 mM Tris) equal to the original volume of culture medium. Allow cultures to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature. Gentle stirring in a gyratory shaker to enhance mixing of the dye.<br>
15.	Spectrophotometrically measure absorbance at a wavelength of 565 nm using a plate reader (BMG). Measure the background absorbance of 96-well plates at 690 nm and subtract from the measurement at 565 nm.<br>
16.	Calculate the inhibition rate (IR) as follows: IR= 100*x (Absorbance of control cells-Absorbance of cells exposed to tested compounds at each concentration)/ Absorbance of control cells %. The IC50 value can be derived from the IRs of compounds at different concentration gradients.<br>

Protocol:<br>
The following protocol is used to assay the cell toxic activity of IC50 value of tested compounds of the invention onA431 cell:<br>
1.	Growing A431 cells in growth media (DMEM/Fl2, supplemented with 10 % FBS) in 100 mm corning culture plates till confluence at 37 °C, 5 % CO2.<br>
2.	Wash A431 cells in 100 mm plates with PBS, harvest cells by trypsinization and seeded cells to corning 96-well cell culture plates at concentration of 50000 cells/ml, leaving 6 wells/each plate empty as background.<br>
3.	Growing seeded 96-well plates at 37 'C, 5 % CO2, till 85 % confluence.<br>
4.	Prepare compounds stock solution, using DMSO solve candidate compounds to a concentration of 20 mM. Then use DMSO to dilute the stock solution to a serious concentration of tested compounds solution (namely, 2 mM, 1 mM, 0.2 mM, 20 µM, 2 µM, 0.2µM).<br>
5.	Use cell culture medium (in this case, DMEM/F12 +10 % FBS) to dilute the compounds solution prepared above. Each DMSO serial concentration compound solution is diluted by 20 times with culture medium by adding 5 ul DMSO compound solution to 95 ul culture medium, then mix well by vortex. This<br>
promise that the DMSO concentration at that the A431 cell will exposed to will not surpass 0.5 %.<br>
6.	After A431 cell has attached to the dish bottom and confluence about 85 %, change the culture medium with fresh DMEM/F12 plus 10 % FBS. Each well added 180 µl medium, then add 20 ul medium solution of tested compounds prepared at step 5 to each well. For control group cell, add 20 ul culture medium containing 0.5 % pure DMSO. So, now A431 cells are exposed to each tested compound at a serial final concentration of 100 µM, 10 µM, 5 µM, 1 µM, 0.1 µM, 0.01 µM, and 0.001 uM. Each 96-well plate, we can test 3 compounds with a control cell group.<br>
7.	Put the culture plates back to incubator, culture for 72 hours at 37 °C, 5 % CO2.<br>
8.	72 hours later, remove cultures from incubator into sterile work area.<br>
9.	Prepare fixative (50 % Trichloroacetic Acid-TCA) by adding reagent grade water to the TCA, fix the cells by gently layering 50 µl of cold TCA solution on top of the growth medium.<br>
10.	Incubate plates for 1 hour at 4 °C and then rinse with water several times to remove TCA, serum proteins, etc. Plates are air dried and stored until use. Bland background optical density is measured in wells incubated with growth medium without cells.<br>
11.	Use 10 % acetic acid solution to prepare 0.4 % Sulforhodamine B solution. Add 50 µl sulforhodamine B solution to each well of 96-well plates.<br>
12.	Allow cells to stain for 30 minutes.	<br>
13.	Prepared the wash solutionof 10 % acetic acid. At the end of the staining period, the stain is removed and the cells rinsed quickly with 1 % acetic acid. Repeat until unincorporated dye is removed. Keep wash times to a minimum to reduce desorption of protein-bound dye. After being rinsed, the cultures are air dried until no moisture is visible.<br>
14.	The incorporated dye is then solubilized in a volume of Sulforhodamine B assay Solubilization solution (10 mM Tris) equal to the original volume of culture medium. Allow cultures to stand for 5 minutes at room temperature. Gentle stirring in a gyratory shaker to enhance mixing of the dye.<br>
15.	Spectrophotometrically measure absorbance at a wavelength of 565 nm using a plate reader (BMG). Measure the background absorbance of 96-well plates at 690 nm and subtract from the measurement at 565 nm.<br>
16.	Calculate the inhibition rate (IR) as follows: IR= 100x (Absorbance of control<br>
cells-Absorbance of cells exposed to tested compounds at each concentration)/ Absorbance of control cells %. The IC50 value can be derived from the IRs of compounds at different concentration gradients.<br>
