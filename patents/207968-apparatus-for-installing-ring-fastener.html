This invention relates to an apparatus for installing ring fastener and the subject matter of this invention is divided out of co. pending application no.1455/MAS/95.<br>
In the co. pending application No.1455/MAS/95, there is described a ring fastner and method of manufacturing ring fastener.<br>
A ring fastener can be used, for example, to axially locate a stepped shaft in a bore. For this purpose wire rod retaining rings are known from prior art. With such wire rod retaining rings for shafts or bores respectively, which in a locating groove of the shaft or the bore, respectively, in a radially compressed or radially expanded condition, respectively, enable the installation of a corresponding machine part by an axial slide on or insertion operation respectively, this machine part can be retained axially located in a radially relieved condition and projecting into a catch slot. For this purpose, the ends of these wire rod retaining rings are bent to approx. 10% of the ring length in an inward direction for a shaft or in an outward direction, respectively, for a bore, in such a manner that the ends while holding the wire rod retaining ring essentially concentric to its groove, rest against the groove bottom.<br>
From prior *art it is also known that a lock ring made from spring wire which comprises inwardly angled ends. Such a lock ring is inserted in the expanded condition into a groove of a stop washer by sliding n so that its angled ends engage an axial recess of the stop washer. The so preassembled construction unit   of  the   stop   washer and   the   lock   ring   is   inserted   for   installation<br><br>
into a cylindrical housing, with the lock ring being radially contracted to such an extent by means of a clamping tool applied at the angled ends that it completely disappears in the groove of the stop washer during the insertion operation. After the axially locating the preassembled construction unit, the lock ring re-expands radially so that it rests partly in the groove of the stop washer and partly in a circumferential groove of the cylindrical housing and thus axially locates the stop washer in the desired manner.<br>
A detachable connection of two housing components is also enclosed by prior art where the outer circumference of a cylindrical shoulder of the one housing component has an annular groove and the wall of a cylindrical recess of the other housing component accommodating the shoulder has an annular groove which forms a radial extension of the first annular groove. An oval annular body is arranged in both annular grooves, which in the disassembled condition has a circular shape with a diameter between the bottom diameters of the two annuaiar grooves. In the installed condition the annular body is pressed into an oval shape by the two screws.<br><br>
o<br>
offset by 180 , with the wall of the recess having an enlarged diameter enclosing the shoulder with a generous clearance.  This detachable connection can absorb relatively high axial forces.  However, its manufacture is relatively expensive, because the screw threads for the two clamping screws must be machined and the clamping screws must be installed in their threads.<br>
Where higher requirements are to be met with respect to the absorption of axial forces and ease of installation, shaft lock rings punched from sheet metal are employed with holes provided in their ends for the application of a clamping tool.<br>
Generally, such shaft lock rings have a cross-section which varies along the circumference of the shaft lock ring. The cross-section in the area of the ends is approximately identical to that in the centre area. The consequence of this is that such lock rings assume an oval shape in the compressed condition.  This makes these rings unsuitable under very confined installation conditions.<br>
In cases where such a shaft lock ring has to be installed in or removed from, respectively, the narrow gap between a shouldered shaft and a cylindrical bore, difficulties will be encountered insofar as the conventional assembly tongs tend to slip off the holes of the shaft lock ring. The same applies to shaft lock rings made from wire with bent ring<br><br>
ends.     The   shaft lock ring often has to be   inserted   several centimeters deep   into the   annular gap between the   shouldered   shaft and   the cylindrical bore.     This complicates its handling considerably.   Finally,   the   shaft lock ring   seated in  the  circumferential  groove  has often engaged   the   circumferential groove  of  the  bore  to  such a depth  that the  holes for  tool  application or the  eyes  formed   in  the   angled  ends, respectively,   are  partly hidden by the  flanks of  the   annular groove.     The  consequence   is   that the   tool  can hardly or not at all  grasp  the   shaft lock ring.<br>
The   invention is  therefore based on  the  object to provide  a ring  fastener which  enables easy assembly and  disassembly.<br>
To  solve   this object,   a  ring fastener with an approximately, circular shape  in  its  rest condition  is provided,   compris-   j ing  two  spaced   ring  ends,   a  cross-section being essentially! constant over at least  150     of  its circumference,   and a   recess  in  the  area  of each  ring end,   which  opens  into  the inner circumference.<br>
This enables a  reliable  engagement of a clamping tool  in the   recesses provided   at  the   ring ends,   where   the   recesses may extend   so  far into the  ring area  that the  clamping  tool can be   inserted without problems.     The  cross-section being maintained  constant over wide   sections of  the   ring   fastener effectively prevents  the   ring ends  from  submerging  into  an<br><br>
annular  groove   to  a  depth where   a  clamping   tool  can no longer engage  the   recesses,<br>
A  particularly  surprising property of  the   ring  fastener according  to  the   invention  is   that  the   axial  forcess which can be  absorbed by  the   ring  fastener are  higher than  those of   similar  shaft lock  rings.<br>
Another unexpected  effect of   the   ring   fastener according   to the   invention is  that it essentially  retains  its circular shape  - with a  smaller diameter - during contraction of  the two  ring ends.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of  the   ring  fastener the  area  of the  essentially constant cross-section  has a   rectangular, square,   round,   or oval cross-section and   is  symmetrical  to the   ring ends.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of  the  ring  fastener the  area with  an essentially constant cross-section extends over up to  250°,   preferably over approx.   202°  of  the  circumference of  the   ring fastener.     This  enables a particularly easy assembly and  disassembly of   the   ring  fastener.<br>
In an embodiment of  the   ring  fastener,   one   recess each  is arranged  adjacent to both ends  of  the  area with  an essentially constant cross-section,   which opens  toward  the  outer circumference  of   the   ring   fastener.        This  enables  the   re-<br><br>
liable grasping of the ring fastener in a compressed condition after it has been brought into this condition by a clamp ing  too1.<br>
In  order  to  hold   the   ring  fastener  in  its  respective  compressed  condition as  reliably and  accurately as possible, it  is  advantageous that each of  the  recesses opening  toward the outer circumference  of the  ring  fastener  includes an angle   ranging  from approx.   5°   to   30°•<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of  the   ring fastener each of  the  recesses opening  toward  the  outer circumference of  the  ring  fastener comprises a bottom which  is offset eccentrically  in an  inward direction  relative  to the envelope of  the  ring  fastener and  has a convex,   preferably approx. semi-circular shape.     The eccentricity of  the  bottom can be defined  such  that a  circle with with a   smaller diameter than  that of  the  envelope  of the  ring  fastener is offset by approx.   1% to  10% of  the diameter of  the  envelope  of  the ring  fastener from  the  centre  of  the  envelope   of  the   ring fastener,   preferably toward  the  constant cross-section area.<br>
In  order to prevent jamming  or canting  of  the   ring   fastener during   installation,   flanks with  rounded   transitions are formed   to  the  bottom of  each  of   the   recesses  opening  toward the  outer circumference  of  the   ring   fastener.<br><br>
In  order  to  reliably  retain  the   ring   fastener  in  its  compressed  condition,   the   flank of each  of  the  recesses  opening  toward   the   outer circumference  of   the   ring  fastener being  closer to  the   respective   ring  end   is preferably deeper  than  the   flank being  at a  greater distance   from  the   respective   ring end.<br>
Each of   the  recesses opening  toward   the  outer circumference of   the   ring  fastener takes up  approx.   10% to  60% of  the ring  fastener cross-section.<br>
To enable  the compression of the  ring ends as far as possible   for a  conventient placement of   the   ring   fastener  in its  installation position,   the   ring  ends  in  the   rest condition of  the  ring  fastener are preferably spaced  from each other by an opening angle  of  5°   to  50°.<br>
To  facilitate  the engagement of  the  clamping  tool for a convenient disassambly also under confined conditions,   the recesses opening  toward  the   inner circumference  have  a convex,   semi-circular bottom with adjoining  straight flanks.<br>
In order to be able  to exert high clamping  forces to  the ring ends for compression or contraction of  the  ring fastener,   each of  the  recesses opening  toward  the  inner circumference  has  a centre  axis directed  away from  the centre  of  the   ring   fastener.<br><br>
The centre axis directed away from the centre of the ring fastener and the axis of symmetry of the ring fastener preferably include an angle of approx. 5° to 25°.  This allows ^high clamping forces and simultaneously a reliable engagement of clamping tongs or a clamping apparatus even under confined conditions.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to an apparatus for installing the above described ring fasteners.  This apparatus comprises a holding means for a ring fastener the ring ends of which are at least partly compressed, and two projections extending from the holding means, each of which engages one of the recesses opening toward the outer circumference of the ring fastener.<br>
This enables the above described ring fasteners to be simply and reliably installed even in a confined environment,<br>
The holding means is preferably formed by a sleeve, the face of which approximately corresponds to the circumferential configuration of the ring fastener.  The projections are arranged at this face.<br>
In an embodiment of the apparatus the holding means comprises at least one taper the cross-section of which has the shape of a circular section or a circular segment, and at which a sliding means is arranged.  This sliding means<br><br>
enables a ring fastener arranged at the apparatus to be brought into its installed final position.<br>
The holding means preferably comprises a first sliding means which in the area of the rings ends engages a ring fastener, and a second sliding means, which is arranged diametrically opposed to the first sliding means and which, in particular, can be actuated together with it.  This allows the easy and rapid installation also of ring fasteners to be installed deep in a bore (if required by means of an automatic handling machine comprising this apparatus).<br>
For the purpose of bringing a ring fastener by means of this apparatus into an annular groove arranged in the bore or behind a shoulder, each sliding means is movable in the longitudinal direction of the sleeve between a retracted position, in which it is set back relative to the holding means, and an advanced position, in which it extends beyond the projections.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the apparatus the sleeve is adapted for holding a component or an assembly to be secured by means of the ring fastener. If the sleeve accommodates the component or the assembly in a dimension-fitting manner, a rapid and reliable assembly can be achieved even with small tolerances.<br><br>
According   to  still  another aspect of  the   invention,   the method   for  installing  an above described   ring  fastener comprises   the   following   steps:<br>
Contracting  the   ring  ends,   so  that  the   ring   fastener  has  a reduced diameter;<br>
maintaining  the   ring  fastener at  its  reduced  diameter; inserting  the   ring   fastener  into an  opening  up  to a  groove or a   shoulder in the  opening;<br>
releasing the  ring  fastener  so  that its diameter increases again and  the  ring  fastener becomes  seated  in  the  groove  or contacts  the   shoulder.<br>
Preferably,<br>
the   step of contracting  the   ring ends  is effected by means of  the  recesses opening  toward  the  inner circumference,   and the   step of  retaining the   ring  fastener is effected by means of  the   recesses opening  toward  the  outer circumference,   with a projection each engaging  the   respective   recess.<br>
Finally,<br>
the   step  of  releasing  the   ring  fastener  is preferably effected by displacing the  ring  fastener,   so  that the   recesses clear the projections.<br>
Further preferable  embodiments,   development and  properties of  the   invention will  be described   in  the   following with reference   to  the  drawings,   in which:<br><br>

from above; and<br>
Fig. 5   shows a partial sectional view of a mechanic<br>
actuation means in which an assembly is installed by means of a ring fastener according to Fig. 1 using the apparatus according to Figs. 2 through 4.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a ring fastener punched from cold drawn and dry zinc-phosphated. spring steel according to the invention, which in its rest position has an approximately circular .configuration.  The ring fastener comprises two ring ends 11, 12 spaced from each other and has an essentially constant cross-section over an area B of approx. 202°. This area B is arranged symmetrically with respect to the ring ends 11, 12 so that the ring fastener is also symmetric with respect tc an axis of symmetry S of the ring fastener extending between the ring ends 11 and 12.<br>
In the area of each ring end 11, 12 a recess 13, 14 opening toward the inner circumference of the ring fastener is arranged. These recesses 13, 14 are used for clamping the<br><br>
ring  prior  to   its  assembly.     Adjacent  to  both  ends  of   the area  B  with  an essentially constant cross-section  a   recess 17/    18  opening   toward   the  outer circumference   of   the   ring fastener  is  arranged.     These   recesses   17,   18  include   an angular  range  a  of  approx.   21°.     The   recesses   17,   18  comprise   a  bottom  21,   22 which  is offset eccentrically  relative  to  the envelope  U of  the  ring  fastener,   which has a convex,   preferably approx.   semi-circular  shape.     Flanks   17a, 17b;   18a,   18b with  rounded  transitions   17c,   17c;   18c,   18d are   formed   to  the  bottom  21,   22 of each  of   the   recesses opening toward   the  outside.<br>
Due   to   the  eccentricity of  the  bottom  offset  in  an  inward direction by  a  distance  E   toward   the  area  B  along   the   axis of   symmetry  S,   the   flank   17a,   18a  of each  of  the   recesses opening  toward   the  outside  being located  nearer to  the respective   ring  end   11,   12  is deeper than  the   flank  17b, 18b being at a  greater distance   from  the   respective   ring end   11/   12.     The   recesses  17,   18 opening  toward   the  outside reduce   the  cross-section of the  ring  fastener in the  area of  the   flank  17b,   18b remote  from the   respective  ring end 11,   12 by  approx.   one   quarter,   and   in  the   area   of   the   flank 17a,   18a  nearer  to  the   respective   ring end   11,   12  by approx.   one  half.<br>
In  their rest condition,   the   ring ends   11,   12  are   spaced   by an opening  angle  b of  approx.   30°.<br><br>
The   recesses  13,   14   opening  toward  the   inner circumference comprise  a   semi-circular bottom  23,   25,   both   sides  of which extend   to  straight parallel   flanks  13a,   13b;   14a,   14b,   The recesses   13,   14   opening   toward   the   inside   reach   so   far  into the   cross-section of   the   ring   fastener  that  it  is  reduced to  approx.   20% to  40% at  its  thinnest point D  of   the   ring end   11,   12.   The   recesses   13,   14  opening   toward   the   inside are   so  oriented   that  their centre   axis M   is directed   away from the  centre  of   the   ring  fastener.   The  centre  axis of the   recesses   13,   14  and   the   axis  of   symmetry S  of   the   ring fastener include  an angle  c of approx.   15°.<br>
Figs.   2   through  4   show  an  apparatus   for assembling  a  previously described   ring  fastener.     This  apparatus comprises  a holding  means   30   for a   ring   fastener   (not  shown).     The   holding  means   30   is   formed  by  a   face   30a  of  a   tubular   sleeve 32,   with  the  face   30a  of  the   sleeve   32  having a   shape  which has  approximately  the  circumferential   shape  of  the   ring fastener,   i.e.   which  has  an essentially circular  shape.     At the   face   30a   two projections   33,    34   are   arranged,   the   shape of  which   is   so   selected   that,   with   the   ring ends pressed together,   they come   into  a   from-fitting engagement with   the recesses  opening   toward   the  outer circumference  of   the   ring fastener.   The  projections   33,   34  are   flush with  the   outside of   the   tubular  sleeve   32.<br>
The  holding  means   30  or  the   cylindrical   sleeve   32,   respectively,   comprises  two diametrically opposed   tapers   36,   37<br><br>
with the shape of a circular section (see Fig. 4) , both of which are arranged at right angles to an axis of symmetry V extending between the two projections 33 and 34.<br>
-In each taper 36, 37 with the shape of a circular section a sliding means 38, 39 is arranged, the dimensions of which are so selected that is does not protrude beyond the circumference of the sleeve 32.  The first sliding means 39 in the area of the ring ends between the projections 33, 34 acts on a ring fastener provided in the holding means 30. The second sliding means 38 acts on the continuous area of the ring fastener.  The two sliding means 38, 39 can be actuated together by means of an actuation means (not shown) in such a manner that the two sliding means 38, 39 are movable in parallel to a longitudinal axis W (see Fig. 2) of the sleeve 32 between a retracted position, in which the sliding means 38, 39 are set back relative to the holding means 30 or the face 30a, respectively, and an advanced position, in which the sliding means 38, 39 extend beyond the projections 33, 34 in an axial direction.<br>
The sleeve 32 comprises a hollow space 42 which is adapted for the dimension-fitting accomodation of a component to be secured by means of the ring fastener.<br>
The method according to the invention for securing a component or an assembly by means of the above described ring fastener will be described below with reference to Fig. 5.<br><br>
Fig.5 shows a part of an otherwise not interesting mechanic actuation means as known from prior art. A cylinder 50 contains spring cage 52 for a spring 54, with the spring cage 52 and the spring 54 being illustrated in a very shortened manner only. The spring 54 acts on an actuation rod 56 which penetrates the spring cage 52.<br>
For the installation of the spring cage 52 and the associated components in the cylinder 50, the spring cage 52 is preassembled with the other components to form an assembly. The ring fastener is contracted by means of clamping tongs, the fingers on which engage the recesses in the ring ends of the ring fastener, opening toward the inner circumference, and placed on to the holding means 30. Thereby the diameter of the ring fastener is reduced, but maintains its essentially circular shape. The projection 33, 34 at the face 30a of the sleeve 32 retain the reduced diameter of the ring fastener. Then the preassembled assembly with the spring cage is inserted into the hollow space 42 of the sleeve 32. The tool with the ring fastener and the assembly are then inserted into the cylinder 50 until the ring fastener 60 is level with a annular groove 62 formed into the inner wall of the cylinder 50. Then the two sliding means 38, 39 are moved from their retracted position into an advanced position. This causes the ring fastener to leave the holding means 30, and the recesses of   the   ring  fastener  opening toward   the    outside  to come clear of the<br><br>
projections   33,    34.     The   ring   fastener  snaps  back  to  its original   shape   with   the   larger diameter  and   engages   the annular  groove  62.   This   secures  the   spring  cage   52  cap-tively   in  the  cylinder   50.     Subsequently,   the   sleeve   32   is pulled   out of   the  cylinder  50.     This  completes   the   installation  operation.<br>
For disassembly,   the   ring  fastener  is  contracted  by means of  clamping   tongs,   the   fingers of  which engage   the   recesses opening  toward  the   inner circumference  of  the   ring  fastener,    so  that  its  diameter  is   reduced.      In  this  condition,   the ring   fastener can  be  pulled  out of  the   annular  groove   62   in the   axial  direction  of  the  cylinder  50.        This   releases   the assembly   so  that  it can  also  be   removed   from  the  cylinder 50.<br><br><br><br>

1)	A device for the installation of a ring fastener with a circular configuration in<br>
the rest condition, comprising two ring ends (11,22) spaced from each other,<br>
an essentially constant cross-section over at least 150° of its circumference,<br>
and in the area of each ring end (11,12) a recess (13, 14) opening toward its<br>
inner circumference, wherein the device comprises a holding means (30) for a<br>
ring fastener, the ring ends of which are at least partly compressed, and two<br>
projections (33, 34) protruding from the holding means, each of which<br>
engages one of the recesses opening toward the outer circumference of the<br>
ring fastener.<br>
2)	A device for the installation of a ring fastener according to claim 1, wherein the holding means (30) is formed by a sleeve (32) of the approximate circumferential configuration of the ring fastener, where at a fact (30a) the projections (33,34) are arranged.<br>
3)	A device for the installation of a ring fastener according to any of claims 1 to 2, wherein the holding means (30) comprises at least one taper (16, 17) the cross-section of which has the shape of a circular section or a circular segment, at which a sliding means (38,39) is arranged.<br><br>
4)	A device for the installation of a ring fastener according to claim 3, wherein the<br>
holding means (30) comprises a first sliding means (39) which in the area of the<br>
rings ends engages a ring fastener, and preferably a second sliding means (38),<br>
which is arranged diametrically opposed to the first sliding means (39) and which,<br>
in particular, can be actuated together with it.<br>
5)	A device for the installation of a ring fastener according to claim 3 to 4,<br>
wherein each sliding means (38,39) can be moved in the longitudinal direction of<br>
the sleeve (32) between a retracted position where it is set back relative to the<br>
holding means (30) and an advanced position where it protrudes beyond the<br>
projections (33,34).<br>
6)	A device for the installation of a ring fastener according to any of Claims 1<br>
through 3, wherein the sleeve (32) is adapted for the insertion of a component or<br>
