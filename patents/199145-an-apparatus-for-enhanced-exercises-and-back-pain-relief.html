The invention relates to an apparatus for exercises that relieve back pain and enchance strength and stretching in both lower and upper body.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In general, most occupations involve either sitting, standing, walking or even worse, canying weights while in motion. In these situations the lower part of the spine or lower back carries a person's upper body weight most of the time. All these activities add stress to the lower back constantly and hence most people suffer from lower back pain one time or another.<br>
This invention is a result of my personal experience. I have had lower back pain for the past several years. I have taken physical therapy and performed various exercises to relieve my back pain. All my attempts failed to produce satisfactory results because of their unsuitability for my back pain or due to inconvenience.<br>
By the end of the day I tend to lie down because of my back pain and thus impairing all other needed activity. I also tend to exercise less since it was not really helping me because of increased stress on my back while exercising. I   have  tried  various types of conventional<br><br>
treadmills and exercising bicycles at home, at work and fitness centers. However, all the equipment I tried failed to relieve my back pain effectively<br>
I wanted to shift my upper body weight to my hands while changing my walking posture, in order to relieve my back pain and to achieve effective upper-body exercises. However, the placement of any hand supports or their design failed to offer my intended purpose.<br>
Prior art related to reducing load on the spine or increasing upper body strength failed to effectively address the stated issues. U.S. Pat. No. 4,986,261 issued to lams et al, on Jan. 22, 1991, discloses an apparatus for walking in spine unloaded state.U.S. Pat. No. 5,704â€ž881 issued to Dudley on Jan. 6, 1999, discloses an apparatus for counterbalancing gravitational forces on the spine, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,110,117 issued to Fisher, et al. on IVIay 5, 1992, discloses a treadmill with pivoting handles for ami exercises. None of the patents discloses any means for relieving back pain or the means of achieving certain postures specified in my current invention for stretching and strengthening exercises.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
I experimented various walking postures on a treadmill while shifting my upper body weight on to my hands in order to relieve my back pain as well as exercising some portions of my body that were not otherwise exercised. The weight shifting was achieved by using a well supported horizontal hand bar running across the walking belt. The bar could be placed at different heights along the belt.<br>
Positioning the horizontal hand bar below my waist level while transferring my upper body weight to the bar caused my spine to bend fonvard, this has stretching effect on my spine. By transferring my upper body weight to the bar, using my hands caused reduction in axial loading of my spine. Walking under these conditions would give good massaging effect on my lower back, which would relieve my pain.<br>
The relative positioning of the hand bar with respect to the walking belt resulted in some postures, which provided additional stretching and strengthening effects on both my upper and lower body.<br><br>
All my experiments and together with my experience using the conventional exercising equipment resulted in my current invention.<br>
The apparatus primarily consists of:<br>
Two rigid vertical posts, each of which is positioned and locked along a rigid rail in a desired position. The rails are attached on the left and right sides of a treadmill belt frame. This fomns the primary assembly for the purpose of this description. Several individual attachments to the vertical posts, separately or in a suitable combination, would provide effective exercises.<br>
The first one is a rigid horizontal hand support bar of a suitable cross-section to provide proper grip and comfort while exerting body counter weight forces through hands. . The horizontal bar is perpendicular to the motion of the belt<br>
The above apparatus, thus, facilitates positioning of the hand bar anywhere along the length of the belt and at any height pemnitted by the vertical supports. The bar together with the supports is capable of supporting the entire weight of the user.<br>
Though several positions are possible to suit individual needs, we can consider the following four primary positions for the purpose of understanding its operation: 1. Front-middle position, 2. Front-lower position, 3. Middle-middle position, 4. Middle-upper position.<br>
In position 1, the hand bar is close to the front edge of the belt, and at a height between the waist and the knee of the user. The user places hands on the hand bar spreading at a comfortable position along the bar, then exerts downward pressure as needed to relieve weight on the lower back while walking at a desired speed. The body may be bent fonward slightly to stretch the spine. Quick relief of lower back can be realized in this operation, while exercising both upper and lower body muscles.<br>
In position 2, the hand bar is lowered to below the knee level of the user. In this position, the spine of the user becomes more horizontal and the axial forces due to body weight on the spine will be reduced significantly. The body weight will be shifted to both hands and legs more evenly, which stretches the spine, which also exercises ami and shoulder muscles.<br><br>
stretching legs as far back as possible while walking causes increased stretching in the hamstrings.<br>
In position 3, the hand bar is raised above the shoulder level, and the posts are moved closer to the middle of the treadmill. The user shifts the load from the lower back to the bar by applying downward force on the bar by pulling the bar down. Again, the user adjusts the load on the bar as needed for the best results.<br>
In position 4, the bar is raised up to the maximum level where the user stretches arms up almost fully. Higher positions provide stretching in the amis and the upper body, similar to chin-ups, while reducing load on the spine for comfortable walk. This will also help stretching in the spine. In this position the user is almost suspended from the hand bar to reduce weight on the spine as well as leg joints.<br>
The treadmill can be inclined forward or backward to achieve the results of strength and stretching exercises in various parts of the body. This facilitates both uphill and downhill walking while adjusting the forces against gravity using the hand support, which results in postures, and hence exercises, that are not provided by conventional treadmills. Inclinations may be steeper than what the conventional treadmills offer.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to facilitate natural movement of the arms through a pair of swinging ami attachments. These can be attached to the vertical supports typically at shoulder level. The ami of the attachment is pivotally attached to provide full circular motion as well as swings closer and away from the user as needed. Resistance and the freedom of the individual direction of rotation or swing can be adjusted as needed. In addition, the length of the arm can be adjusted to suit individual needs. Also, shock absorbing means provided will reduce shock while weight shifting. This attachment allows the user to swing hands more naturally while walking in different postures.<br>
It is an additional object of the present invention to provide an adjustable platfonn to serve various utility functions such as holder for a book, TV, display, and controls. The user will be able to position and orient these more ergonomically as needed. The controls may include wired or wireless apparatus to control functions of various visual, sensory and motion equipment.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to accommodate when one of user's legs is unable to function. An attachment to serve as a footrest can be positioned at a convenient height along one of the posts should the user find it necessary to rest one of the legs. Additional spring action will provide necessary cushioning effect while the other leg and the rest of the body is worl<ing out.></ing>
Another object of the invention is to provide an adjustable attachment for an air circulating equipment such as a fan or air conditioner to minimize perspiration and help prolonged workout. The attachment can be oriented and locked at a convenient height along the posts.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide for programmed functioning of all the attachments such as automatic and periodic movement of the hand bar as well as the vertical supports to be able to exercise more effectively for desired results. Various input parameters can be measured for monitoring and controlling the apparatus for safe and effective operations.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a cost-effective solution. The basic apparatus that permit most of the stated exercises can be build with only a small additional cost to an existing treadmill or bicycle as an attachment. It is also easy to manufacture and assemble the parts. The complete apparatus, which offer automatic and power driven movements of the parts, may be manufactured using the existing technology.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
(DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS)<br>
The preferred embodiments herein presented are chosen and described to explain the invention so that others skilled in the art might use its merits. They are not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise fomi disclosed.<br>
FIG. 1 shows one embodiment of the invention in a perspective view showing the apparatus with a hand bar, a hand swing, a utility platfomn, and a fan assembly. Vertical support posts 3, are locked in approximately a middle position along rails 1, attached to the left and the right sides of the walking belt 9, of a treadmill. Posts 3, can slide and lock in a position along rails 1, by means of rigid rail joints 2. Joints 2, may also contain a motor driven gear mechanism, pneumatic means, or cable means to move posts 3, along rails 1, and move any of the attachments vertically along posts 3. Rails 1, may further include cogs, a threaded drive shaft, or cable and pulleys to facilitate the movements.<br>
Hand bar 5 is at an upper level locked in position at the joints 4, attached to the vertical support posts 3. The hand bar may rotate about its axis, and the resistance of rotation may<br><br>
be selectively varied by elastic or frictional means. This rotation will provide additional exercise to the user's wrists and foreamns individually or in combination with other exercises.<br>
A pair of hand swings 11, which may be attached approximately at user's shoulder level to the posts 3 to facilitate natural ami movements while exercising. The hand swings are pivotally mounted to posts 3, by joints 12. The pivotal means provides rotation of the hand swings along two perpendicular axes. Resistance of rotation along the two axes may be independently and selectively varied by frictional or elastic means. In addition to providing ami exercises, the hand swings also facilitate selectively shifting of upper body weight to the hands by adjusting the vertical height of swing joints 12. Details of the hand swings are shown in FIG. 8 and FIG. 9.<br>
A fan assembly 15, is pivotally attached to the posts 3 at a desired height, by means of extensible support arms 14. The fan assembly 15, therefore, can be positioned and oriented to provide comfortable airflow to the user while wori<ing out.></ing>
Adjustable utility platfonn 8, is attached at a desired height along posts 3, using platfomn joints 6. Platfomn 8 is pivotally mounted to platform amis 7 and locked at a position along its length. This platfomn assembly provides comfortable height and orientation for the user. Each side of platform 8, may be used for supporting one or more of the components such as electronic controls, monitoring devices, a television, a book, and a computer. Platfomi 8, provides an ergonomic means for placement of such components.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the embodiment of FIG. 1 in a side elevation view. This shows rail 1, rail joint 2, post 3, hand bar joint 4, platfomn joint 6, platfonn support arm 7, utility platfomn 8, hand swings 11 in a rotated position, hand swing joint 12, fan assembly support arm 14, fan assembly 15, and fan assembly joint 16.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a perspective view of an embodiment consisting of hand and underamn supports 21 for both left and right hands. These supports provide means for selectively transferring upper body weight to posts 3 through underamns and forearms while perfomning exercises. Support joints 22, provide means of locking along posts 3 at a desired height. Posts 3 are positioned conveniently in the middle along the treadmill belt. Suitable shape and shock absorbing means may be provided to supports 21, in order to support underamns<br><br>
and hands comfortably. FIG. 3 also shows foot or leg resting means in the event the user is unable to use one of the lower limbs due to temporary or permanent inability.<br>
FIG. 4, FIG. 5, FIG. 6 and FIG. 7 show hand bar 5 in four different exemplary positions using joints 6 along posts 3, in order for the user to achieve different effects while exercising.<br>
FIG. 4 shows hand bar 5 in a front-middle position. Posts 3 are locked in a front position, and hand bar 5 is locked at a level which is below user's waist and above the knee. The user places hands on the hand bar spreading at a comfortable position along the bar, then exerts downward pressure as needed to relieve weight on the lower back while walking at a desired speed. The body may be bent forward slightly to stretch the spine. Quick relief of lower back can be realized in this operation, while exercising both upper and lower body muscles.<br>
FIG. 5 shows hand bar 5 in a front-lower position. Posts 3 are locked in a front position, and hand bar 5 is locked at a level which is below user's knee. In this position, the spine of the user becomes more horizontal and the axial forces due to body weight on the spine will be reduced significantly. The body weight will be shifted to both hands and legs more evenly, which stretches the spine, which also exercises arm and shoulder muscles. Stretching legs as far back as possible while walking causes increased stretching in the hamstrings.<br>
FIG. 6 shows hand bar 5 in a middle-middle position. Posts 3 are locked in a front position, and hand bar 5 is locked at a level which is above user's waist and below user's head level. The user shifts the load from the back to the bar by applying downward pressure on the bar by pulling the bar down. Again, the user adjusts the load on the bar as needed for the best results.<br>
FIG. 7 shows hand bar 5 in a middle-upper position. Posts 3 are locked in a front position, and hand bar 5 is locked at a level where the user's hands are almost fully stretched vertically up. IHigher positions provide stretching in the arms and the upper body, similar to chtn-ups, while reducing load on the spine for comfortable walk. This will also help stretching in the spine. In this position, the user is almost suspended from the hand bar to reduce weight on the spine as well as leg joints.<br>
FIG. 8 and FIG. 9 show the details of the hand swing 11, of FIG. 1. FIG. 8 is a side elevation view and FIG. 9 is a front elevation view. Knob 31, is a means for adjusting resistance in<br><br>
front and back swing movements. Knob 32, is a means for adjusting resistance in left and right swing movements. Knob 33 is a means for adjusting the length of the swing arm to suit the user's needs. Knob 34, provides a means for adjusting the shock absorbing resistance while swinging and transfemng upper body load to the handles 35, by adjusting the opposing force of an internal spring.<br>
FIG. 10 shows a perspective view of the frame of the apparatus, which includes a base with two side rails 1, rail joints 2, and vertical support posts 3. The frame along with the any suitable combination of the stated attachments could be used with an existing treadmill or an exercise bicycle for some or all of the exercises described above.<br><br><br>
