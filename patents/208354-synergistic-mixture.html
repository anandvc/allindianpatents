&amp;<br>
THE PATENTS RULES, 2003<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"MIXTURE, COMPRISING THE ACTIVE COMPOUNDS<br>
INDOXACARB"<br><br>
BAYER  AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT,   a   German   company   of  D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
From the order of the Hymenoptera, for example, Camponotus herculeanus, Lasius fuliginosus, Lasius niger, Lasius umbratus, Monomorium pharaonis, Paravespuia spp., Tetramorium caespitum.<br>
From the order of the Anoplura, for example, Pediculus humanus capitis, PedicuJus<br>
5	humanus corporis, Phthirus pubis.<br>
From the order of the Heteroptera, for example, Cimex hemipterus, Cimex lectularius, Rhodnius prolixus, Triatoma infestans.<br>
In the field of household insecticides, they are used alone or in combination with<br>
10	other  suitable  active compounds,  suh  as  phosphonic  acid  esters,  carbamates,<br>
pyrethroids, growth regulators or active compounds from other known classes of insecticides.<br>
They are used as aerosols, pressureless spray products, for example pump and<br>
1:&gt;	atomizer  sprays,  automatic  fogging  systems,  foggers,  foams,  gels,  evaporator<br>
products with evaporator tablets made of cellulose or polymer, liquid evaporators, gel and membrane evaporators, propeller-driven evaporators, energy-free, or passive, evaporation systems, moth papers, moth bags and moth gels, as granules or dusts, in baits for spreading or in bait stations. 20<br>
As already mentioned above, it is possible to treat all plants and their parts according<br>
to the invention. In a preferred embodiment, wild plant species and plant cultivars, or<br>
those obtained by conventional biological breeding methods, such as crossing or<br>
protoplast fusion, and parts thereof, are treated. In a further preferred embodiment,<br>
2,5	transgenic plants and plant cultivars obtained by genetic engineering, if appropriate<br>
in combination with conventional methods (Genetically Modified Organisms), and parts thereof are treated. The terms "parts", "parts of plants" and "plant parts" have been explained above.<br>
30	Particularly preferably,  plants  of the  plant  cultivars  which  are  in  each  case<br>
commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant<br><br><br>
43<br><br>
-<br>
cultivars are to be understood as meaning plants having certain properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conentional breeding, by mutagenesis or by recombinant DNA techniques. This can be varieties, bio- and genotypes<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, diet), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or a widening of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions which can be used<br>
1)0	according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low<br>
temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products are possible<br>
1|5	which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected.<br>
The transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are preferred and to be treated according to the invention include all plants which,  in  the  genetic  modification,  received  genetic  material   which  imparts<br>
2p	particularly advantageous useful traits to these plants. Examples of such traits are<br>
better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salt content, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or<br>
2j&gt;	processability  of the  harvested  products.  Further  and  particularly  emphasized<br>
examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds.  Examples  of transgenic  plants which may be mentioned are the<br>
3(j)	important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice), maize, soya beans, potatoes,<br>
cotton, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits<br><br><br>
and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton<br>
and oilseed rape. Traits that are particularly emphasized are the increased defence of<br>
the plants against insects by toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed by<br>
the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a),<br>
:i	CryIA(b), CryIA(c), CryllA, CrylUA, CrymB2, Cry9c Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF<br>
and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits that are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of the plants to fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors, and resistance genes and correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulphonylureas, glyphosate or phosphinotricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes in question which impart the desired traits can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be<br>
lj&gt;	mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato<br>
varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example maize, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example maize), StarLink® (for example maize), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucotn® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which  may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton<br>
2)0	varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup<br>
Ready® (tolerance to glyphosate, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinotricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulphonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in  a conventional  manner for herbicide<br>
2)5	tolerance) which may be mentioned include the varieties sold under the name<br>
Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these or still-to-be-developed genetic traits, which plants will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the active compound mixtures according to the invention.<br><br><br>

Formula for calculating the kill rate for a combination of two active compounds<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Colby, S.R., "Calculating Synergistic and Antagonistic Responses of Herbicide Combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20-22, 1967):<br>
If<br>
X        is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compound A at an application rate of m ppm,<br><br>
Y        is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when<br>
1J5	employing active compound B at an application rate of n ppm and<br>
E        is the kill rate, expressed as a percentage of the untreated control, when employing active compounds A and B at application rates of m and n ppm,<br>
23	then<br><br>
If the actual insecticidal kill rate exceeds the calculated value, the action of the<br>
combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present. In this case, the<br>
2|5	actually observed kill rate must exceed the value calculated using the above formula<br>
for the expected kill rate (E).<br><br><br><br>
Example A Phaedon larvae test<br>
Solvent:	7  parts by weight of dimethylformamide<br>
$	Emulsifier:	2  parts by weight of alkylaryl polyglycol ether<br>
To produce a suitable preparation of active compound, 1 part by weight of active compound is mixed with the stated amounts of solvent and emulsifier, and the concentrate is diluted with emulsifier-containing water to the desired concentration. 1|3<br>
Cabbage leaves (Brassica oleracea) are treated by being dipped into the preparation of active compound of the desired concentration and are populated with larvae of the mustard beetle (Phaedon cochleariae) while the leaves are still moist.<br>
l|5	After the desired period of time, the kill in % is determined. 100% means that all<br>
beetle larvae have been killed; 0% means that none of the beetle larvae have been killed. The kill rates determined are calculated using Colby's formula (see sheet 1).<br>

Formula for calculating the synergistic effect of a combination of two active compounds<br>
The expected action for a given combination of two active compounds can be calculated as follows (cf. Carpenter, C.S., "Mammalian Toxicity of 1-Naphthyl-7V-methylcarbamate [Sevin Insecticide]", Agricultural and Food Chemistry, Vol. 9, No. 1, pages 30-39, 1961):<br>
If<br>
Pa	is the percentage of active compound A in the mixture,<br>
Pb	is the percentage of active compound B in the mixture,<br><br>
15	LC50  or 95)a    is the concentration at which 50% (or 95%) of the animals treated<br>
with active compound A are killed and<br>
LC50 (  o r 95) b    is the concentration at which 50% (or 95%) of the animals treated<br>
with active compound B are killed,<br><br>
1<br>
then the expected LC  50 (or  95)  ( comb.) =			<br>
Pa	Pb<br><br>
If the calculated LC50 (or 95) is higher than the actual value and above the confidence interval, the action of the combination is superadditive, i.e. a synergistic effect is present.<br><br><br><br>
