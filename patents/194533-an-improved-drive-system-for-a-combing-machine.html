				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to an improved drive system for a combing machine. This invention particularly relates to an improved driving system for the drafting, coiler and can plate of a combing machine.<br>
Combing machines are very well known . A typical combing machine consists of rows of combing heads disposed along a longitudinal axis and with a drafting arrangement for receiving and drafting the sliver from the combing heads. Normally the drafting arrangement consists of drafting rollers which are arranged approximately horizontally and at right angles to the longitudinal axis or direction of row of the combing heads . A can plate is also provided for mounting a sliver can to receive the drafted sliver from the drafting arrangement as well as a funnel wheel for directing the drafted slivers from the drafting arrangement into the sliver can. Further the can plate and the funnel wheel are mounted in such a way to rotate about the vertical axis. An embodiment of such a device has been described in the German patent no OS 4119877<br>
The drive for such a combing machine has employed a main drive shaft which extents parallel to the longitudinal direction of the combing heads. In order to drive the various components of the delivery end such as drafting rollers, coiler and can plate, drive devices with several direction changes of 90 deg. each have been used.<br>
Such drive arrangements are relatively complex and expensive. It is complex because for driving the delivery end drive element, gear wheels arranged at an angle 90 degrees to the combing heads , which comprises for example ,several angular gears.<br>
Another relatively simple transmission system for driving the components of a combing machine has been disclosed in the US patent no 5,502,875 The combing machine disclosed in the US patent comprises a row of combing heads disposed along a longitudinal axis to deliver slivers therefrom ; a drafting arrangement for receiving and<br><br>
drafting slivers from the said combing heads, said drafting arrangement including a plurality of horizontal cylinders disposed transversely of said longitudinal axis ; a can plate for mounting a sliver can thereon to receive drafted sliver from said drafting arrangement, said can plate being rotatable about a vertical axis; a funnel wheel for directing drafted sliver from said drafting arrangement into a sliver can on said can plate ,said funnel wheel being rotatable about said vertical axis ; a main drive shaft extending parallel to said longitudinal axis; a drafting arrangement drive shaft parallel to and drivingly connected to said cylinders of said drafting arrangement; a vertical drive shaft parallel to said vertical axis and drivingly connected to said can plate and said funnel wheel; a first V drive drivingly connecting said main drive shaft to said drafting arrangement drive shaft; said V drive including a crossed tooth belt for transmitting a drive force from said main drive shaft to said drafting arrangement drive shaft ;, a transfer shaft parallel to and drivingly connected to said drafting arrangement drive shaft and a second V drive drivingly connecting the said transfer shaft to said vertical drive shaft , said second V drive including a crossed toothed belt for transmitting a drive force from said transfer shaft to said vertical shaft which drives the coiler and can plate. For details the patent may be referred to .<br>
It is stated in the US patent that the above construction of the combing machine has resulted in making the combing machine simple and inexpensive . In addition it has also been stated that the combing machine provides a transmission which is subject to relatively lesser backlash due to the usage of timing belt drive.<br>
In yet another type of a known combing machine, one bevel gear pair is incorporated for driving the drafting rollers of the drafting system through a spur gear train and another spur train from a drive shaft , drivingly connected to a worm and worm wheel transferring the drive to the coiler and the calendar rollers through a cordon shaft.<br>
In the above system the coiler is driven by epicyclic gear train, which imposed a limitation to the speed of the coiler. Such limitation of the speed of the coiler results in reduced production of the machine consequently effecting the efficiency of the machine .<br><br>
Further the system comprises more number of relatively heavier moving parts , creating more inertial load consequently requiring consumption of more power making the system un economical.<br>
In addition the drive being open the lubrication of the machine becomes difficult, resulting in wear and tear of the gears . Also such arrangement produces more noise.<br>
In yet another known combing machine, one bevel gear pair is incorporated for driving the rear rollers of the drafting system and another bevel gear and timing belt drive is provided through a gear train for driving the first roller of the drafting system and the drafting calendar rollers. The drive from the gear train is also taken via another timing belt to the input shaft of the gearbox, which is perpendicular to both drafting rollers and can plate axis.<br>
From the gearbox ,drive is taken thro bevel gear pair via a vertical shaft, arranged perpendicular to the drafting rollers and parallel to the axes of coiler and can plate, the coiler being driven by timing belt arrangement. Another drive shaft of the gearbox, which is parallel to the axes of coiler and can plate ,driven by worm and worm wheel of the gear box , drives the can plate through pulleys and belt.<br>
In this system the bevel gear at the input end requires not only frequent lubrication but also produces more noise. Therefore it is not possible to use this drive system in high speed combers. In addition since the drive being open causes difficulties in lubricating, resulting in wear and tear of gears, resulting in the maintenance of the machine very difficult.<br>
Due to the advancement of the technology and the availability of high speed and rapidly spinning machines it has become necessary that appropriate improvements have also to be made on various aspects of the machines especially in the driving system of the combing machine   Under the above said circumstances regular work is being conducted<br><br>
to find out better means of driving the components of the combing machine to make it simple efficient and cost effective .<br>
From the above survey of prior art it can be observed that developmental are being undertaken in the above mentioned direction<br>
Objectives of the invention:<br>
It is therefore the main objective of the present invention to provide an improved driving system for driving delivery end components such as drafting rollers, coiler and can plate of a combing machine.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved driving system for driving the delivery end components of a combing machine which is simple , efficient and cost effective.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved driving system<br>
for driving the delivery end   components of a combing machine which has minimum<br>
number of drives thereby reducing the manufacturing and maintenance costs.<br>
»<br>
The above objectives have been achieved according to the present invention by developing an improved drive system for coiler and can plate and combining the system with a known drive system used for driving the drafting rollers.<br>
