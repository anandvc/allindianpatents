TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Process for producing an aromatic carbonate<br>
Field of The Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing an aromatic carbonate. More particularly,<br>
the present invention is concerned with a process for<br>
producing an aromatic carbonate, which comprises:<br>
transesterifying a starting material selected from the<br>
group consisting of a dialkyl carbonate, an alkyl aryl<br>
carbonate and a mixture thereof with a reactant se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of an aromatic mono-<br>
hydroxy compound, an alkyl aryl carbonate and a mixture<br>
thereof, in the presence of a catalyst, to thereby ob-<br>
tain a high boiling point reaction mixture comprising a<br>
desired aromatic carbonate (a) and an aromatic carbon-<br>
ate ether (b), while withdrawing a low boiling point<br>
reaction mixture containing a low boiling point<br>
by-product; and separating the aromatic carbonate ether<br>
(b) from the high boiling point reaction mixture to<br>
thereby obtain a high purity aromatic carbonate. By<br>
the process of the present invention, it becomes possi-<br>
ble to produce a high purity aromatic carbonate which<br>
exhibits advantageously high reactivity when used as a<br>
raw material for a transesterification aromatic poly-<br><br>
carbonate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] An aromatic carbonate is useful as a raw mate-<br>
rial for, e.g., the production of an aromatic polycar-<br>
bonate (whose utility as engineering plastics has been<br>
increasing in recent years) without using poisonous<br>
phosgene. With respect to the method for the produc-<br>
tion of an aromatic carbonate, a method for producing<br>
an aromatic carbonate or an aromatic carbonate mixture<br>
is known, in which a dialkyl carbonate, an alkyl aryl<br>
carbonate or a mixture thereof is used as a starting<br>
material and an aromatic monohydroxy compound, an alkyl<br>
aryl carbonate or a mixture thereof is used as a reac-<br>
tant, and in which a transesterification reaction is<br>
performed between the starting material and the reac-<br>
tant, thereby producing an aromatic carbonate or an<br>
aromatic carbonate mixture which corresponds to the<br>
starting material and the reactant.<br>
[0003] However, since this type of transesterifica-<br>
tion is a reversible reaction in which, moreover, not<br>
only is the equilibrium biased toward the original sys-<br>
tem but the reaction rate is also low, the production<br>
of an aromatic carbonate by the above-mentioned method<br>
on a commercial scale is accompanied with great diffi-<br><br>
culties. To improve the above-mentioned method, sev-<br>
eral proposals have been made, most of which relate to<br>
the development of a catalyst for increasing the reac-<br>
tion rate. As a catalyst for use in the method for<br>
producing an alkyl aryl carbonate, a diaryl carbonate<br>
or a mixture thereof by reacting a dialkyl carbonate<br>
with an aromatic hydroxy compound, there have been pro-<br>
posed various metal-containing catalysts, which include<br>
for example, a Lewis acid, such as a transition metal<br>
halide, or compounds capable of forming a Lewis acid<br>
(see, for example, Patent Document 1), a tin compound,<br>
such as an organotin alkoxide or an organotin oxide<br>
(see, for example, Patent Document 2), salts and alkox-<br>
ides of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal, and<br>
lead compounds (see, for example, Patent Document 3),<br>
complexes of a metal, such as copper, iron or zirconium<br>
(see, for example, Patent Document 4), titanic acid es-<br>
ters (see, for example, Patent Document 5), a mixture<br>
of a Lewis acid and a protonic acid (see, for example,<br>
Patent Document 6), a compound of Sc, Mo, Mn, Bi, Te or<br>
the like (see, for example, Patent Document 7), and<br>
ferric acetate (see, for example, Patent Document 8).<br>
[0004] As a catalyst for use in the method for pro-<br>
ducing a diaryl carbonate by a same-species inter-<br>
molecular transesterification, wherein an alkyl aryl<br><br>
carbonate is disproportionated to a dialkyl carbonate<br>
and a diaryl carbonate, there have been proposed vari-<br>
ous catalysts, which include for example, a Lewis acid<br>
and a transition metal compound which is capable of<br>
forming a Lewis acid (see, for example, Patent Document<br>
9), a polymeric tin compound (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 10), a compound represented by the formula<br>
R-X(=0)OH (wherein X is selected from Sn and Ti, and R<br>
is selected from monovalent hydrocarbon groups) (see,<br>
for example, Patent Document 11), a mixture of a Lewis<br>
acid and a protonic acid (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 12), a lead catalyst (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 13), a titanium or zirconium compound (see,<br>
for example, Patent Document 14), a tin compound (see,<br>
for example, Patent Document 15), and a compound of Sc,<br>
Mo, Mn, Bi, Te or the like (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 7).<br>
[0005] Another attempt for improving the yield of<br>
aromatic carbonates in these reactions consists in dis-<br>
placing the equilibrium in the direction of the desired<br>
product formation as much as possible, by modifying the<br>
mode of the reaction process. For example, there have<br>
been proposed a method in which by-produced methanol is<br>
distilled off together with an azeotrope forming agent<br>
by azeotropic distillation in the reaction of a di-<br><br>
methyl carbonate with phenol (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 16), and a method in which by-produced metha-<br>
nol is removed by adsorbing the same onto a molecular<br>
sieve (see, for example, Patent Document 17).<br>
[0006] Further, a method is known in which an appara-<br>
tus comprising a reactor having provided on the top<br>
thereof a distillation column is employed in order to<br>
separate and distill off alcohols (by-produced in the<br>
course of the reaction) from a reaction mixture ob-<br>
tained in the reactor (see, for example, Patent Docu-<br>
ment 18) .<br>
[0007] As more preferred methods for producing an<br>
aromatic carbonate, the present inventors previously<br>
developed a method in which a dialkyl carbonate and an<br>
aromatic hydroxy compound are continuously fed to a<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column to effect a<br>
continuous transesterification reaction in the distil-<br>
lation column, while continuously withdrawing a low<br>
boiling point reaction mixture containing a by-produced<br>
alcohol from an upper portion of the distillation col-<br>
umn by distillation and continuously withdrawing a high<br>
boiling point reaction mixture containing a produced<br>
alkyl aryl carbonate from a lower portion of the dis-<br>
tillation column (see, for example, Patent Document 19),<br>
and a method in which an alkyl aryl carbonate is con-<br><br>
tinuously fed to a continuous multi-stage distillation<br>
column to effect a continuous transesterification reac-<br>
tion in the distillation column, while continuously<br>
withdrawing a low boiling point reaction mixture con-<br>
taining a by-produced dialkyl carbonate by distillation<br>
and continuously withdrawing a high boiling point reac-<br>
tion mixture containing a produced diaryl carbonate<br>
from a lower portion of the distillation column (see,<br>
for example, Patent Document 20). These methods for<br>
the first time realized efficient, continuous produc-<br>
tion of an aromatic carbonate. Thereafter, various<br>
methods for continuously producing an aromatic carbon-<br>
ate have further been developed, based on the<br>
above-mentioned methods developed by the present inven-<br>
tors. Examples of these methods include a method in<br>
which a catalytic transesterification reaction is per-<br>
formed in a column reactor (see, for example, Patent<br>
Document 21), a method which uses a plurality of reac-<br>
tors which are connected in series (see, for example,<br>
Patent Document 22), a method in which a bubble tower<br>
reactor is used (see, for example, Patent Document 23),<br>
and a method in which a vertically long reactor vessel<br>
is used (see, for example, Patent Document 24).<br>
[0008] Also, there have been proposed methods for de-<br>
creasing the amounts of impurities and/or by-products<br><br>
contained in an aromatic carbonate produced by any of<br>
the above-mentioned methods. For example, it is known<br>
that when an aromatic carbonate is produced by trans -<br>
esterification, high boiling point substances (each<br>
having a boiling point higher than that of the aromatic<br>
carbonate) are likely to be by-produced. For example,<br>
Patent Document 8/Patent Document 2 5 discloses that<br>
when diphenyl carbonate is produced by a transesterifi-<br>
cation of dimethyl carbonate with phenol, an impurity<br>
having a boiling point equal to or higher than the<br>
boiling point of the produced diphenyl carbonate is<br>
by-produced, and that the impurity is caused to enter<br>
the diphenyl carbonate and causes the discoloration of<br>
an ultimate product, such as an aromatic polycarbonate.<br>
This prior art document does not disclose an example of<br>
the impurity having a boiling point equal to or higher<br>
than the boiling point of the produced diphenyl carbon-<br>
ate; however, as an example of the impurity, there can<br>
be mentioned an aryloxycarbonyl-(hydroxy)-arene which<br>
is produced as an isomer of a diaryl carbonate by Fries<br>
rearrangement. More specifically, when diphenyl car-<br>
bonate is produced as the diaryl carbonate, phenyl<br>
salicylate can be mentioned as an example of the<br>
aryloxycarbonyl-(hydroxy)-arene. Phenyl salicylate is<br>
a high boiling point substance whose boiling point is<br><br>
4 to 5 °C higher than the boiling point of the diphenyl<br>
carbonate.<br>
[0009] In this case, when the transesterification is<br>
conducted for a long period of time, the above-mentioned<br>
high boiling point substance accumulates in the reaction<br>
system and the amount of the impurity mixed into the<br>
product, namely an aromatic carbonate, tends to increase,<br>
so that the purity of the ultimate aromatic carbonate is<br>
lowered. Further, as the amount of the high boiling<br>
point substance in the reaction mixture increases, the<br>
boiling point of the reaction mixture rises, which in<br>
turn necessitates the elevation of the temperature of<br>
the reaction mixture so as to separate the high boiling<br>
point substance. As a result, the by-production of the<br>
high boiling point substance is accelerated, thus ren-<br>
dering it difficult to produce a desired aromatic car-<br>
bonate stably for a prolonged period of time. As a<br>
measure for stably producing an aromatic carbonate for a<br>
prolonged period of time, there has been proposed a<br>
method in which a liquid reaction mixture containing a<br>
high boiling point substance and a metal-containing<br>
catalyst is withdrawn from the reaction system, followed<br>
by reacting the withdrawn reaction mixture with a spe-<br>
cific reactant for separating the reaction mixture into<br>
a component derived from the high boiling point sub-<br><br>
stance and a component derived from the metal-containing<br>
catalyst, thereby removing the high boiling substance<br>
from the reaction system (see, for example, Patent Docu-<br>
ment 26) .<br>
[0010] Further, impurities and/or by-products having<br>
boiling points lower than that of an aromatic carbonate<br>
are also known. Specifically, for example, Patent<br>
Document 2 7 proposes a method for separation of alkyl<br>
aromatic ethers (anisoles) from an aromatic carbonate.<br>
[0 011] However, heretofore, there has not been known<br>
any method which can be used for efficiently producing<br>
a high purity aromatic carbonate which exhibits advan-<br>
tageously high reactivity when used as a raw material<br>
for a transesterification aromatic polycarbonate, and,<br>
hence, it has been desired to develop such a method.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to Be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0013] An object of the present invention is to pro-<br><br>
vide a process for producing a high purity aromatic<br>
carbonate which exhibits advantageously high reactivity<br>
when used as a raw material for a transesterification<br>
aromatic polycarbonate.<br>
Means to Solve the Problems<br>
[0014] For solving the above-mentioned problems, the<br>
present inventors have made extensive and intensive<br>
studies. As a result, they have unexpectedly found<br>
that a specific aromatic carbonate ether is contained<br>
in an aromatic carbonate produced by a process compris-<br>
ing transesterifying a starting material selected from<br>
the group consisting of a dialkyl carbonate, an alkyl<br>
aryl carbonate and a mixture thereof with a reactant<br>
selected from the group consisting of an aromatic mono-<br>
hydroxy compound, an alkyl aryl carbonate and a mixture<br>
thereof, in the presence of a catalyst, to thereby ob-<br>
tain a high boiling point reaction mixture comprising a<br>
desired aromatic carbonate, while withdrawing a low<br>
boiling point reaction mixture containing a low boiling<br>
point by-product. Further, they have also found that,<br>
when an aromatic carbonate containing a large amount of<br>
the above-mentioned specific aromatic carbonate ether<br>
is used as a raw material for producing a transesteri-<br>
fication aromatic polycarbonate, the polymerization re-<br><br>
activity of the aromatic carbonate is lowered and the<br>
resultant aromatic polycarbonate is discolored, and<br>
that, by separating and removing the aromatic carbonate<br>
ether from the reaction system for producing an aro-<br>
matic carbonate to thereby reduce the aromatic carbon-<br>
ate ether content of an aromatic carbonate, it becomes<br>
possible to obtain an aromatic carbonate having a high<br>
transparency, which exhibits high polymerization reac-<br>
tivity when used as a raw material for an aromatic<br>
polycarbonate. The present invention has been com-<br>
pleted, based on these novel findings.<br>
[0015] The foregoing and other objects, features and<br>
advantages of the present invention will be apparent<br>
from the following detailed description taken in con-<br>
nection with the accompanying drawings, and the ap-<br>
pended claims.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
[0016] In the aromatic carbonate produced by the<br>
process of the present invention, the content of a spe-<br>
cific aromatic carbonate ether (which is a convention-<br>
ally unknown impurity and has a harmful influence on<br>
the reactivity of an aromatic carbonate) is reduced.<br>
The aromatic carbonate obtained by the process of the<br>
present invention has a high purity and exhibits high<br><br>
polymerization reactivity when used as a raw material<br>
for an aromatic polycarbonate, so that the aromatic<br>
carbonate is useful as a raw material for a trans -<br>

for producing an aromatic carbonate by transesterifying<br>
a starting material with a reactant in the presence of<br>
a catalyst, are represented by the following formulae<br>
(E1), (E2), (E3) and (E4):<br><br>
[0055]<br><br>
[0056] wherein R1, R2, R3, Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3 are as<br>
defined above, and wherein when R2 = R3 and<br>
Ar2 = Ar3 in formula (E4), the reaction is a<br>
same-species intermolecular transesterifica-<br>
tion reaction generally known as a dispropor-<br>
tionation reaction.<br>
[0057] When each of the reactions of formulae (E1),<br>
(E2), (E3) and (E4) is performed according to the proc-<br>
ess of the present invention, dialkyl carbonates or<br><br>

ally or in combination.<br>
[0058] When R2 = R3 and Ar2 = Ar3 in the transesterifi-<br>
cation reaction of formula (E4), a diaryl carbonate and<br>
a dialkyl carbonate can be obtained by a same-species<br>
intermolecular transesterification reaction of a single<br>

R1 = R2 = R3 and Ar1 = Ar2 = Ar3 in formulae (E1) and<br>

obtained from a dialkyl carbonate and an aromatic mono-<br>
hydroxy compound through an alkyl aryl carbonate as<br>
shown in formulae (E5) and (E6) shown below.<br>
[0059]<br><br><br>
[0060] The above-mentioned combination is an espe-<br>
cially preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0061] Recycling of the dialkyl carbonate by-produced<br>
in the reaction of formula (E6) as the starting mate-<br>
rial for the reaction of formula (E5) results in the<br>
formation of 1 mol of a diaryl carbonate and 2 mol of<br>
an aliphatic alcohol from 1 mol of a dialkyl carbonate<br>
and 2 mol of an aromatic monohydroxy compound. When<br>
R = CH3 and Ar = CSH5 in the above formula (E5) , di-<br>
phenyl carbonate, which is an important raw material<br>
for a polycarbonate and a polyisocyanate, can be read-<br>
ily obtained from dimethyl carbonate, which is the sim-<br>
plest form of a dialkyl carbonate, and phenol. This is<br>
especially important.<br>

[0065] These catalysts are effective even when they<br>
are reacted with an organic compound present in the re-<br>
action system, such as an aliphatic alcohol, an aromatic<br>
monohydroxy compound, an alkyl aryl carbonate, a diaryl<br>
carbonate or a dialkyl carbonate. Those which are ob-<br>
tained by heat-treating these catalysts together with a<br>
starting material, a reactant and/or a reaction product<br>
thereof prior to the use in the process of the present<br>
invention can also be used.<br>
[0066] It is preferred that the metal-containing cata-<br>
lyst has high solubility in the liquid phase of the re-<br><br>
action system. Preferred examples of metal-containing<br>
catalysts include Pb compounds, such as PbO, Pb(OH)2 and<br>
Pb(OPh)2; Ti compounds, such as TiCl4 and Ti(OPh)4; Sn<br>
compounds, such as SnCl4, Sn(OPh)4, Bu2SnO and<br>

Fe(OPh)3; and those products which are obtained by<br>
treating the above metal compounds with phenol or a<br>
liquid phase of the reaction system.<br>
[0067] The transesterification reaction performed in<br>
the process of the present invention is an equilibrium<br>
reaction. Therefore, in the process of the present in-<br>
vention, in order to displace the equilibrium of the<br>
transesterification reaction in the direction of the de-<br>
sired product formation, the transesterification reac-<br>
tion is performed, while withdrawing a low boiling point<br>
reaction mixture which contains a low boiling point<br>
by-product comprising an aliphatic alcohol, a dialkyl<br>
carbonate or a mixture thereof corresponding to the<br>
starting material and the reactant and represented by at<br>
least one formula selected from the group consisting of<br>
ROH and ROCOOR, wherein R is as defined above.<br>
[0068] There is no particular limitation with respect<br>
to the type of the reactor to be used in the process of<br>
the present invention, and various types of conven-<br>
tional reactors, such as a stirred tank reactor, a<br><br>
multi-stage stirred tank reactor and a multi-stage dis-<br>
tillation column, can be used. These types of reactors<br>
can be used individually or in combination, and may be<br>
used either in a batchwise process or a continuous<br>
process. From the viewpoint of efficiently displacing<br>
the equilibrium in the direction of the desired product<br>
formation, a multi-stage distillation column is pre-<br>
ferred, and a continuous process using a multi-stage<br>
distillation column is especially preferred. There is<br>
no particular limitation with respect to the<br>
multi-stage distillation column to be used in the pre-<br>
sent invention as long as it is a distillation column<br>
having a theoretical number of stages of distillation<br>
of two or more and which can be used for performing<br>
continuous distillation. Examples of such multi-stage<br>
distillation columns include plate type columns using a<br>
tray, such as a bubble-cap tray, a sieve tray, a valve<br>
tray and a counterflow tray, and packed type columns<br>
packed with various packings, such as a Raschig ring, a<br>
Lessing ring, a Pall ring, a Berl saddle, an Intalox<br>
saddle, a Dixon packing, a McMahon packing, a Heli pack,<br>
a Sulzer packing and a Mellapak. In the present inven-<br>
tion, any of the columns which are generally used as a<br>
multi-stage distillation column can be utilized. Fur-<br>
ther, a mixed type of plate column and packed column<br><br>
comprising both a plate portion and a portion packed<br>
with packings, can also be preferably used.<br>
[0069] In one preferred embodiment of the present in-<br>
vention, the starting material and the reactant are<br>
continuously fed to a continuous multi-stage distilla-<br>
tion column to perform a transesterification reaction<br>
between the starting material and the reactant in a<br>
liquid phase or a gas-liquid phase in the presence of a<br>
metal-containing catalyst as the catalyst, while con-<br>
tinuously withdrawing the high boiling point reaction<br>
mixture (containing the aromatic carbonate (a) and the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (b) produced by the trans-<br>
esterif ication reaction) in a liquid form from a lower<br>
portion of the distillation column and continuously<br>
withdrawing by distillation the low boiling point reac-<br>
tion mixture (containing the low boiling point<br>
by-product) in a gaseous form from an upper portion of<br>
the distillation column, thereby enabling the aromatic<br>
carbonate to be produced continuously. In this case,<br>
the aromatic carbonate ether (b) is separated from the<br>
high boiling point reaction mixture withdrawn from the<br>
distillation column.<br>
[0070] The amount of the catalyst used in the present<br>
invention varies depending on the type thereof, the<br>
types and weight ratio of the starting material and the<br><br>
reactant, the reaction conditions, such as the reaction<br>
temperature and the reaction pressure, and the like.<br>
Generally, the amount of the catalyst is in the range<br>
of from 0.0001 to 30 % by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the starting material and the reactant.<br>
[0071] The reaction time (or the residence time when<br>
the reaction is continuously conducted) for the trans -<br>
esterification reaction in the present invention is not<br>
specifically limited, but it is generally in the range<br>
of from 0.001 to 50 hours, preferably from 0.01 to 10<br>
hours, more preferably from 0.05 to 5 hours.<br>
[0072] The reaction temperature varies depending on<br>
the types of the starting material and reactant, but is<br>
generally in the range of from 50 to 350 °C, preferably<br>
from 100 to 280 °C. The reaction pressure varies de-<br>
pending on the types of the starting material and reac-<br>
tant and the reaction temperature, and it may be any of<br>
a reduced pressure, an atmospheric pressure and a su-<br>
peratmospheric pressure. However, the reaction pres-<br>
sure is generally in the range of from 0.1 to 2.0 x<br>
107 Pa.<br>
[0073] In the present invention, it is not necessary<br>
to use a reaction solvent. However, for the purpose of<br>
facilitating the reaction operation, an appropriate<br>
inert solvent, such as an ether, an aliphatic hydrocar-<br><br>
bon, an aromatic hydrocarbon or a halogenated aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon, may be used as a reaction solvent.<br>
[0074] The process of the present invention is char-<br>
acterized in that it comprises a step for separating an<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (b) represented by the follow-<br>
ing formula (7):<br>
R0R4OCOOAr	(7)<br>
wherein R and Ar are, respectively, se-<br>
lected from the group consisting of R1, R2<br>
and R3 and selected from the group consist-<br>
ing of Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3 in correspondence<br>
to the starting material and the reactant,<br>
and R4 is a divalent group -(CH2)m- (wherein<br>
m is an integer of from 2 to 4) which is<br>
unsubstituted or substituted with at least<br>
one substituent selected from the group<br>
consisting of an alkyl group having 1 to 10<br>
carbon atoms and an aryl group having 6 to<br>
10 carbon atoms.<br>
[0075] In conventional processes for producing an<br>
aromatic carbonate, the presence of the above-mentioned<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (b) has not been known.<br>
Therefore, needless to say, there has been no conven-<br><br>
tional knowledge about the influence of the aromatic<br>
carbonate ether (b) on the purity of an aromatic car-<br>
bonate and the transesterification reactivity of an<br>
aromatic carbonate.<br>
[0076] Illustrative examples of R4 in formula (7)<br>
include: -CH2CH2-, -CH (CH3) CH2-, -CH (CH3) CH (CH3) - ,<br>
-CHPhCH2-, -CH2CH2CH2-, -CH (CH3) CH2CH2-, -CH2CH (CH3) CH2-<br>
and -CH2CH2CH2CH2- .<br>
[0077] Specific examples of the above-mentioned aro-<br>
matic carbonate ethers (b) include: CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh,<br>
CH3CH2OCH2CH2OCOOPh, CH3OCH(CH3) CH2OCOOPh,<br>
CH3OCH2CH2CH2OCOOPh and CH3OCH2CH2CH2CH2OCOOPh.<br>
[0078] Conceivable reasons for the presence of the<br>
aromatic carbonate ethers (b) in the reaction system<br>
are as follows.<br>
(A)	An aromatic carbonate ether as an impurity is<br>
present in raw materials used for producing an aromatic<br>
carbonate by transesterification.<br>
(B)	A precursor of an aromatic carbonate ether, as<br>
an impurity, is present in raw materials used for pro-<br>
ducing an aromatic carbonate by transesterification, and<br>
the precursor is converted into an aromatic carbonate<br>
ether in the reaction system. For example, when a dial-<br>
kyl carbonate as a raw material contains, as an impurity,<br>
a compound represented by the following formula (8):<br><br>
ROR4OCOOR	(8)<br>
wherein R and R4 are as described above for<br>
formulae (5) and (7),<br>
it is considered that this compound is converted into<br>
an aromatic carbonate ether (b) by a reaction with an<br>
aromatic monohydroxy compound, an alkyl aryl carbonate<br>
or a diaryl carbonate.<br>
[0079] In the present invention, for the reason of<br>
item (B) above, it is preferred that the content of the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether precursor of formula (8) in<br>
the dialkyl carbonate used as a starting material is<br>
low. Specifically, the content of the precursor of<br>
formula (8) is preferably in the range of from 0.1 to<br>
1,000 ppm by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 300<br>
ppm by weight.<br>
[0080] In the present invention, the content of the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (b) of formula (7) as an impu-<br>
rity in the obtained high purity aromatic carbonate is<br>
generally 30 ppm by weight or less, preferably 10 ppm<br>
by weight or less, more preferably 3 ppm by weight or<br>
less, still more preferably 1 ppm by weight or less.<br>
[0081] In the present invention, the expression "the<br>
reaction system" indicates the inner portions of a re-<br><br>
actor, a separation-purification apparatus, a heater, a<br>
cooler, a conduit and the like which are used in a sys-<br>
tem for producing the aromatic carbonate.<br>
[0082] With respect to the method for separating the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (b) from the high boiling point<br>
reaction mixture, any methods can be employed as long as<br>
the aromatic carbonate ether (b) can be separated and<br>
removed from the reaction system. Examples of such<br>
separation methods include a gas phase-condensed phase<br>
separation method, such as a gas phase-liquid phase<br>
separation method, a gas phase-solid phase separation<br>
method or a gas phase-solid/liquid mixed phase separa-<br>
tion method; a solid phase-liquid phase separation<br>
method, such as sedimentation, centrifugation or<br>
filtration; distillation; extraction; and adsorption.<br>
Of these, distillation and adsorption are preferred, and<br>
the distillation is more preferred.<br>
[0083] As specific examples of the method for sepa-<br>
rating the aromatic carbonate ether (b) in the case<br>
where an aromatic carbonate is produced from dimethyl<br>
carbonate (DMC) as the dialkyl carbonate and phenol<br>
(PhOH) as the aromatic monohydroxy compound using two<br>
multi-stage distillation columns (first and second<br>
multi-stage distillation columns) which are connected<br>
in series, wherein the synthesis of methyl phenyl<br><br>
carbonate (MPC) is performed in the first multi-stage<br>
distillation column and the synthesis of diphenyl<br>
carbonate (DPC) is performed in the second multi-stage<br>
distillation column, there can be mentioned:<br>
method (i) in which, since the aromatic carbonate<br>
ether (b) has a boiling point close to that of DMC, a<br>
part of DMC (containing the aromatic carbonate ether<br>
(b)), which is formed in the DPC synthesis (in which<br>
DPC and DMC are produced by the disproportionation of<br>
MPC) and is recycled to the DPC synthesis, is withdrawn<br>
from the system,<br>
method (ii) in which the DMC which is recycled as<br>
mentioned above to the DPC synthesis is purified by<br>
distillation to thereby remove the aromatic carbonate<br>
ether (b) from the DMC prior to the recycling thereof<br>
to the DPC synthesis, and<br>
method (iii) in which fresh DMC as the starting<br>
material used in the MPC synthesis is purified by dis-<br>
tillation to thereby remove CH3OCH2CH2OCOOCH3 (an aro-<br>
matic carbonate ether precursor of formula (8)) from<br>
the fresh DMC.<br>
[0084] The above-mentioned separation methods can be<br>
employed individually, or at least two of such separa-<br>
tion methods can be simultaneously or stepwise employed.<br>
[0085] With respect to the temperature and pressure<br><br>
for the separation of the aromatic carbonate ether (b),<br>
the temperature and pressure can be appropriately de-<br>
termined, taking into consideration the boiling points<br>
of the aromatic carbonate ether (b) and other compo-<br>
nents (such as dimethyl carbonate) present in the reac-<br>
tion system.<br>
[0086] In one preferred embodiment of the present in-<br>
vention, a diaryl carbonate obtained by the process of<br>
the present invention is used for producing an aromatic<br>
polycarbonate by transesterification. When the diaryl<br>
carbonate obtained by the process of the present inven-<br>
tion is used for producing an aromatic polycarbonate by<br>
transesterification, it becomes possible to perform the<br>
polymerization reaction at a high polymerization rate.<br>
Further, a high quality aromatic polycarbonate which is<br>
colorless can be obtained by the transesterification of<br>
an aromatic dihydroxy compound with the diaryl carbon-<br>
ate obtained by the process of the present invention.<br>
[0087] With respect to the material of an apparatus<br>
used for producing the aromatic carbonate, there is no<br>
particular limitation. However, stainless steel, glass<br>
or the like is generally used as a material of at least<br>
the inner walls of the apparatus.<br>
[0088] Hereinbelow, the present invention will be de-<br><br>
scribed in more detail with reference to the following<br>
Examples and Comparative Examples, but they should not<br>
be construed as limiting the scope of the present in-<br>
vention.<br>
[0089] The metal concentration of a metal-containing<br>
catalyst was measured by means of an ICP (inductively<br>
coupled plasma emission spectral analyzer). The con-<br>
centration of an organic matter in a liquid was meas-<br>
ured by gas chromatography.<br>
[0090] The number average molecular weight of an aro-<br>
matic polycarbonate was measured by gel permeation<br>
chromatography (GPC) (solvent: tetrahydrofuran; column:<br>
polystyrene gE1), utilizing the molecular weight con-<br>
version calibration curve obtained with respect to the<br>
standard mono-disperse polystyrene samples, wherein the<br>
molecular weight conversion calibration curve is repre-<br>
sented by the following formula:<br>
MPC = 0.3591MPS1.0388<br>
wherein MPC represents the molecular weight of<br>
the aromatic polycarbonate and MPS represents<br>
the molecular weight of the standard polysty-<br>
rene .<br>
[0091] All of the concentrations are indicated by<br><br>
weight percentages.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0092] Preparation of Catalyst&gt;<br>
A mixture of 4 0 kg of phenol (PhOH) and 8 kg of<br>
lead monoxide was heated at 180 °C for 10 hours,<br>
thereby performing a reaction. After that period of<br>
time, water formed in the resultant reaction mixture<br>
was distilled off together with unreacted phenol to<br>
thereby obtain catalyst A.<br>
[0093] <production of aromatic carbonate><br>
Using catalyst A, production of diphenyl carbonate<br>
was performed using a system as shown in Fig. 1. Con-<br>
tinuous multi-stage distillation column 1 was comprised<br>
of a plate column having a height of 12 m and a diame-<br>
ter of 8 inches and equipped with 40 sieve trays. A<br>
mixture of dimethyl carbonate (which contained 58 ppm<br>
by weight of CH3OCH2CH2OCOOCH3, precursor of the aro-<br>
matic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) ) , phenol and<br>
methyl phenyl carbonate was continuously fed in a liq-<br>
uid form from conduit 3 through preheater 4 and conduit<br>
5 into continuous multi-stage distillation column 1 at<br>
a position of 0.5 m below top 2 thereof at a rate of<br>
31 kg/hr, and was allowed to flow down inside<br><br>
multi-stage distillation column 1, thereby performing a<br>
reaction. The formulation of the above-mentioned mix-<br>
ture was adjusted so that a liquid in conduit 5 was<br>
comprised of 49.9 % by weight of dimethyl carbonate<br>
(DMC), 44.7 % by weight of phenol (PhOH) and 4.9 % by<br>
weight of methyl phenyl carbonate (MPC), wherein the<br>
liquid in conduit 5 was comprised of a liquid in con-<br>
duit 19 (wherein the liquid in conduit 19 was recovered<br>
from evaporator 14), a liquid in conduit 129 (wherein<br>
the liquid in conduit 129 was recovered from continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 101) and the<br>
above-mentioned mixture fed from conduit 3. Dimethyl<br>
carbonate (which contained 58 ppm by weight of<br>
CH3OCH2CH2OCOOCH3, precursor of the aromatic carbonate<br>
ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh)) was fed from conduit 7 to<br>
evaporator 8, evaporated in evaporator 8, and fed in a<br>
gaseous form through conduit 9 to bottom 6 of continu-<br>
ous multi-stage distillation column 1 at a rate of<br>
55 kg/hr. Catalyst A was fed to continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 1 in such an amount that the Pb<br>
concentration of a reaction mixture in conduit 13 be-<br>
came 0.O42 % by weight, wherein the Pb concentration<br>
can be measured using a sample of the reaction mixture<br>
withdrawn through a sampling nozzle (not shown) pro-<br>
vided on conduit 13.<br><br>
[0094] Continuous multi-stage distillation column 1<br>
was operated under conditions wherein the temperature<br>
at the column bottom was 203 °C and the pressure at the<br>
column top was 7.4 x 105 Pa. Continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 1 was kept warm by means of a heat<br>
insulating material and a part of the column was heated<br>
by means of a heater (not shown). Gas distilled from<br>
column top 2 was led through conduit 10 into condenser<br>
11, in which the gas was condensed. The resultant con-<br>
densate was continuously withdrawn at a rate of<br>
55 kg/hr through conduit 12. On the other hand, a re-<br>
action mixture was continuously withdrawn from column<br>
bottom 6 at a rate of 31 kg/hr and led into evaporator<br>
14 through conduit 13. In evaporator 14, a gas and a<br>
concentrated liquid containing catalyst A and the like<br>
were formed. A part of the concentrated liquid was led<br>
into reboiler 17 through conduits 15 and 16 and recy-<br>
cled to evaporator 14 through conduit 18. The remain-<br>
der of the concentrate in evaporator 14 was recycled at<br>
a rate of 1 kg/hr to continuous multi-stage distilla-<br>
tion column 1 through conduits 15, 19 and 3. On the<br>
other hand, the gas formed in evaporator 14 was fed<br>
through conduits 21 and 105 into continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 101 at a position of 2.0 m below<br>
top 1O2 thereof, which column was comprised of a plate<br><br>
recycling of the condensate to continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 1 through conduit 129, fresh phe-<br>
nol was fed from conduit 3 so that the mixture in con-<br>
duit 5 maintained the above-mentioned formulation.<br>
[0096] A part of the reaction mixture at bottom 106<br>
of continuous multi-stage distillation column 101 was<br>
led into reboiler 131 through conduit 130, and recycled<br>
to column bottom 106 through conduit 132, and the re-<br>
mainder of the reaction mixture was led to evaporator<br>
114 through conduit 113 at a rate of 8.8 kg/hr. In<br>
evaporator 114, a gas and an evaporation-concentrated<br>
liquid containing the catalyst and high boiling point<br>
substances were formed. A part of the concentrated<br>
liquid was led into reboiler 117 through conduits 115<br>
and 116 and recycled to evaporator 114 through conduit<br>
118. The remainder of the concentrated liquid in<br>
evaporator 114 was recycled to continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 101 through conduits 115, 119 and<br>
105 at a rate of 2 kg/hr.<br>
[0097] The gas formed in evaporator 114 was fed<br>
through conduit 121 into continuous multi-stage distil-<br>
lation column 201 at a position of 2.0 m below top 2O2<br>
thereof, which column was comprised of a plate column<br>
having a height of 6 m and a diameter of 6 inches and<br>
provided with 20 sieve trays. In column 201, diphenyl<br><br>
column having a height of 6 m and a diameter of<br>
10 inches and provided with 20 sieve trays, thereby<br>
performing a reaction. The formulation of the mixture<br>
in conduit 105 was as follows: DMC: 4 3.1 % by weight;<br>
PhOH: 24.5 % by weight; MPC: 27.1 % by weight; and DPC<br>
(diphenyl carbonate): 4.5 % by weight (the mixture in<br>
conduit 105 was comprised of a gas introduced through<br>
conduit 21 and a liquid introduced from conduit 119,<br>
which was recycled from evaporator 114). Catalyst A<br>
was fed to column 101 in such an amount that the Pb<br>
concentration of the reaction mixture in conduit 113<br>
became 0.16 % by weight, wherein the Pb concentration<br>
can be measured using a sample withdrawn from a sam-<br>
pling nozzle (not shown) provided on conduit 113.<br>
[0095] Continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
101	was operated under conditions wherein the tempera-<br>
ture at the column bottom was 198 °C and the pressure<br>
at the column top was 3.7 x 1O4 Pa. Gas distilled from<br>
column top 1O2 was led through conduit 125 to con-<br>
denser 126, in which the gas was condensed. A part of<br>
the resultant condensate was recycled to column top<br>
1O2	through conduit 12 8, and the remainder of the con-<br>
densate was recycled to continuous multi-stage distil-<br>
lation column 1 through conduits 12 7 and 12 9, pre-<br>
heater 4 and conduit 5. After the start of the<br><br>
carbonate was separated from the gas. Continuous<br>
multi-stage distillation column 201 was operated under<br>
conditions wherein the temperature at the column bottom<br>
was 184 °C and the pressure at the column top was<br>
2 x 103 Pa. Gas distilled from top 2O2 of the column<br>
was led through conduit 225 to condenser 226, in which<br>
the gas was condensed. A part of the resultant conden-<br>
sate was recycled to top 2 O2 of the column through con-<br>
duit 22 8, another part of the condensate was recycled<br>
to continuous multi-stage distillation column 101<br>
through conduits 22 7 and 22 9, and the remainder of the<br>
condensate was withdrawn through nozzle 229A provided<br>
on conduit 22 9 at a rate of 0.0 5 kg/hr. A gas was<br>
withdrawn from continuous multi-stage distillation col-<br>
umn 201 through conduit 233 provided at a position of<br>
4 m below column top 2O2 and was led to condenser 234,<br>
in which the withdrawn gas was condensed. The resul-<br>
tant condensate was withdrawn at a rate of 6.7 kg/hr<br>
through conduit 23 5.<br>
[0098] When the operation reached a stationary state,<br>
various analyses were performed. As a result, it was<br>
found that the condensate withdrawn from nozzle 229A<br>
contained 9.2 % by weight of an aromatic carbonate<br>
ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh), and that the condensate with-<br>
drawn from conduit 235 contained 99.99 % by weight or<br><br>
more of diphenyl carbonate, wherein the concentration<br>
of the aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) in<br>
the condensate was 5 ppm by weight.<br>
[0099] [Comparative Example 1]<br>
Diphenyl carbonate was produced in substantially<br>
the same manner as in Example 1, except that the with-<br>
drawal of the condensate from nozzle 229A was not per-<br>
formed. When the operation reached a stationary state,<br>
various analyses were performed. As a result, it was<br>
found that the condensate withdrawn from conduit 235<br>
contained 99.90 % by weight to less than 99.99 % by<br>
weight of diphenyl carbonate, wherein the concentration<br>
of an aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) in the<br>
condensate was 68 ppm by weight. The results of Exam-<br>
ple 1 and this Comparative Example 1 show that the pu-<br>
rity of the diphenyl carbonate obtained is improved<br>
when, as in Example 1, a part of a column top reaction<br>
mixture containing an aromatic carbonate ether is with-<br>
drawn from continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
201.<br>
Example 2<br>
[0100] Diphenyl carbonate was produced in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 1, except that a<br><br>
system as shown in Fig. 2 was used instead of a system<br>
as shown in Fig. 1, and that the following step was<br>
further performed: the condensate withdrawn through<br>
conduit 22 9 (wherein the condensate was obtained by<br>
condensing the gas withdrawn from the column top of<br>
continuous multi-stage distillation column 201) was fed<br>
to continuous multi-stage distillation column 301 at a<br>
position of 0.8 m below the column top 3 O2 thereof,<br>
which column was comprised of a packed column type dis-<br>
tillation column having a height of 2 m and a diameter<br>
of 2 inches and having packed therein Dixon packings<br>
(3 mmc))) . An aromatic carbonate ether was withdrawn<br>
from the continuous multi-stage distillation column 301.<br>
Continuous multi-stage distillation column 301 was op-<br>
erated under conditions wherein the temperature at the<br>
column bottom was 2 O4 °C and the pressure at the column<br>
top was 1.5 x 1O2 Pa. Gas distilled from column top<br>
3 O2 of the column was led through conduit 32 5 to con-<br>
denser 32 6, in which the gas was condensed. A part of<br>
the resultant condensate was recycled to column top 3 O2<br>
of the column through conduit 32 8, and the remainder of<br>
the condensate was recycled to continuous multi-stage<br>
distillation column 101 from conduit 229C through con-<br>
duits 327 and 329 at a rate of 0.05 kg/hr. A gas was<br>
withdrawn from continuous multi-stage distillation col-<br><br>
umn 3 01 through conduit 333 provided at a position of<br>
1.2 m below column top 3O2 and was led to condenser 334,<br>
in which the withdrawn gas was condensed. The resul-<br>
tant condensate was withdrawn at a rate of 0.O2 9 kg/hr<br>
through conduit 335.<br>
[0101] A part of the reaction mixture at column bot-<br>
tom 306 of continuous multi-stage distillation column<br>
301 was led to reboiler 331 through conduit 33 0, and<br>
recycled to column bottom 306 through conduit 332, and<br>
the remainder of the reaction mixture was fed to con-<br>
tinuous multi-stage distillation column 201 through<br>
conduits 313 and 205 at a rate of 0.O21 kg/hr.<br>
[01O2] When the operation reached a stationary state,<br>
various analyses were performed. As a result, it was<br>
found that the liquid withdrawn from conduit 335 con-<br>
tained 16 % by weight of an aromatic carbonate ether<br>
(CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh), and that the condensate withdrawn<br>
from conduit 235 contained 99.99 % by weight or more of<br>
diphenyl carbonate, wherein the aromatic carbonate<br>
ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) was not detected.<br>
[0103] [Comparative Example 2]<br>
Diphenyl carbonate was produced in substantially<br>
the same manner as in Example 2, except that the with-<br>
drawal of the liquid from conduit 335 was not performed.<br><br>
When the operation reached a stationary state, various<br>
analyses were performed. As a result, it was found<br>
that the condensate withdrawn from conduit 23 5 con-<br>
tained 99.90 % by weight to less than 99.99 % by weight<br>
of diphenyl carbonate, wherein the concentration of an<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) in the con-<br>
densate was 61 ppm by weight. The results of Example 2<br>
and this Comparative Example 2 show that the purity of<br>
the diphenyl carbonate obtained is improved when, as in<br>
Example 2, the aromatic carbonate ether was withdrawn<br>
using continuous multi-stage distillation column 301.<br>
Example 3<br>
[01O4] Diphenyl carbonate was produced in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 2, except that the<br>
rate at which the condensate was withdrawn from conduit<br>
335 was changed to 0.O2 kg/hr. When the operation<br>
reached a stationary state, various analyses were per-<br>
formed. As a result, it was found that the condensate<br>
withdrawn from conduit 23 5 contained 9 9.99 % or more of<br>
diphenyl carbonate, wherein the concentration of the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) in the con-<br>
densate was 1 ppm by weight.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
[010 5] Diphenyl carbonate was produced in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 2, except that the<br>
rate at which the condensate was withdrawn from conduit<br>
335 was changed to 0.015 kg/hr. When the operation<br>
reached a stationary state, various analyses were per-<br>
formed. As a result, it was found that the condensate<br>
withdrawn from conduit 235 contained 99.99 % or more of<br>
diphenyl carbonate, wherein the concentration of the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) was 2.5 ppm<br>
by weight.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0106] 235 g of diphenyl carbonate obtained in Exam-<br>
ple 2 (wherein, in the diphenyl carbonate, the aromatic<br>
carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh) was not detected) and<br>
22 8 g of bisphenol A were placed in a vacuum reactor<br>
equipped with an agitator. The temperature of the re-<br>
sultant mixture was slowly elevated from 180 to 220 °C<br>
while stirring and purging the atmosphere of the reac-<br>
tor with nitrogen gas. Subsequently, the reactor was<br>
hermetically sealed, and a polymerization was effected<br>
under 8,000 Pa for 30 minutes while stirring at 100 rpm<br>
and, then, under 4,000 Pa for 90 minutes while stirring<br>
at 100 rpm. Thereafter, the temperature of the reactor<br><br>
was elevated to 270 °C, and a polymerization was ef-<br>
fected under 70 Pa for 1 hour, thereby obtaining an<br>
aromatic polycarbonate. The obtained aromatic polycar-<br>
bonate was colorless and transparent and, hence, had an<br>
excellent color. The aromatic polycarbonate had a num-<br>
ber average molecular weight of 11,500.<br>
[010 7] [Comparative Example 3]<br>
An aromatic polycarbonate was produced in substan-<br>
tially the same manner as in Example 5, except that the<br>
diphenyl carbonate (containing 67 ppm by weight of the<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh)) obtained in<br>
Comparative Example 2 was used. The obtained aromatic<br>
polycarbonate was discolored to assume a yellow color,<br>
and had a number average molecular weight of 7,500.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0108] An aromatic polycarbonate was produced in sub-<br>
stantially the same manner as in Example 5, except that<br>
the diphenyl carbonate (containing 1 ppm by weight of<br>
the aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh)) ob-<br>
tained in Example 3 was used. The obtained aromatic<br>
polycarbonate was colorless and transparent and, hence,<br>
had an excellent color. The aromatic polycarbonate had<br>
a number average molecular weight of 11,000.<br><br>
Example 7<br>
[010 9] An aromatic polycarbonate was produced in sub-<br>
stantially the same manner as in Example 5, except that<br>
the diphenyl carbonate (containing 2.5 ppm by weight of<br>
the aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh)) ob-<br>
tained in Example 4 was used. The obtained aromatic<br>
polycarbonate was colorless and transparent and, hence,<br>
had an excellent color. The aromatic polycarbonate had<br>
a number average molecular weight of 10,500.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0110] An aromatic polycarbonate was produced in sub-<br>
stantially the same manner as in Example 5, except that<br>
the diphenyl carbonate (containing 5 ppm by weight of<br>
the aromatic carbonate ether (CH3OCH2CH2OCOOPh)) ob-<br>
tained in Example 1 was used. The obtained aromatic<br>
polycarbonate was colorless and transparent and, hence,<br>
had an excellent color. The aromatic polycarbonate had<br>
a number average molecular weight of 9,500.<br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
[0111] In the aromatic carbonate produced by the<br>
process of the present invention, the content of an<br>
aromatic carbonate ether (which is a conventionally un-<br>
known impurity and has a harmful influence on the reac-<br>
tivity of an aromatic carbonate) is reduced. The aro-<br>
matic carbonate obtained by the process of the present<br>
invention has a high purity and exhibits high polymeri-<br>
zation reactivity when used as a raw material for a<br>
polycarbonate, so that the aromatic carbonate is useful<br>
as a raw material for a transesterification aromatic<br>
polycarbonate.<br><br>
