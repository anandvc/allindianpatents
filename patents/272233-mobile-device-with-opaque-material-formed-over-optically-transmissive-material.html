DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0043] Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or similar parts.<br>
[0044] First of all, specific examples of slide-type mobile devices will be . described, but such teachings apply equally to other types of mobile devices. Accordingly, the various teachings of the present disclosure may be implemented using, for example, slide-type, bar-type, folding-type, and swivel-type, mobile devices.<br>
[0045] Fig. 2 is a perspective view of slide-type mobile device 10 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Mobile device 10 includes first body 30 and second body 20. The first body is structured to define an enclosure to contain various electrical components necessary for the mobile device. In particular, first body 30 includes<br>
6<br>
<br>
cover 32, frame 34, and housing 31. The frame is sized to receive cover 32. Typically, opaque material is formed over a portion of the cover such that the opaque material is arranged to define an optically transmissive display portion 40. The display portion is located on the cover to cooperate with an underlying display.<br>
[0046] If desired, cover 32 may further include an integrated input portion. For instance, the cover may include a plurality of optically transmissive input regions 42. Similar to display portion 40, each of the input regions may be defined or bounded by portions of the opaque material formed over the cover.<br>
[0047] Speaker aperture 44 is shown formed on one end of cover 32, while microphone aperture 45 is shown formed in the wall of frame 34. These elements respectively cooperate with an underlying speaker and microphone (not shown in this figure).<br>
[0048] Second body 20 includes main key pad 22, which is designed to receive input from a user. The second body may also include a communication module (not shown) for transmitting and receiving signals, and a main printed circuit board (not shown) in which the communication module is mounted.<br>
[0049] FIG. 3 is an exploded perspective view of the first body of FIG. 2. This figure shows display 12 and touch pad 14, which may be positioned within first body 10. Coupling of cover 32 and frame 34 may be accomplished using, for example, adhesive 60. The adhesive may be positioned on mounting surface 52, which is shown located along an inner perimeter of the frame. Coupling of housing 31 and frame 34 may be accomplished using, for example, cooperating pins and pin receptacles.<br>
[0050] For instance, as shown in FIG. 3, several pin receptacles 55 are positioned on an interior region of housing 31. These pin receptacles cooperate with pins and pin receptacles located on the bottom side of frame 34 (not shown in this figure). After assembly,<br>
7<br>
<br>
display 12 is positioned relative to display portion 40, and touch pad 14 is positioned relative to a bottom side of input regions 42.<br>
[0051] Touch pad 14 may be implemented using conventional touch pad technologies which are capable of detecting user manipulation or other contact with an . associated one or more of input regions 42. During use, the touch pad generates signals which may be communicated to a printed circuit board, for example. Touch pad 14 may be positioned relative to the bottom side of cover 32 using known techniques (e.g., adhesive, tape, and the like). Suitable touch pads include, for example, pressure-sensitive touch pads, capacitance touch pads, and the like.<br>
[0052] Touch pad 14 may also include one or more strategically located light guides 15. As shown, each light guide 15 is associated with an individual input region 42 of the cover. As an example, the touch pad may be shaped to define an aperture which forms an individual light guide. In an embodiment, one or more light sources 16 may be positioned relative to the bottom side of touch pad 14. If desired, the light sources may be directly coupled to the touch pad. Light guides 15 are often implemented to permit light provided by light sources 16 to pass through touch pad 14, and consequently, optically transmissive input regions 42. If desired, optically transmissive material may be formed within some or all of the light guides. This feature enhances the structural integrity of the touch pad.<br>
[0053] Light sources 16 may be implemented using known devices and structures which can provide light at the wavelength of interest to one or more input regions 42. Typical light sources include light emitting diodes (LEDs) and vertical surface emitting lasers (VCSELs), among others.<br>
[0054] It is notable that light emitted by light sources 16 is not unnecessarily hindered by structures, which is common in conventional assemblies. More specifically, light emitted by light sources 16 reaches input regions 42 relatively unimpeded. This reduces<br>
8<br>
<br>
the number of needed light sources, which consequently reduces the power requirements of the assembly.<br>
[0055] Although possible, it is not necessary for each input region 42 to have an associated light source 16. In general, the number of light sources is fewer than the number of input regions. In some implementations, a single light source provides sufficient light to all input regions. Maximum light to the touch keys may be achieved by positioning each light source relatively close to an associated light guide 15.<br>
[0056] Frame 34 is shown having speaker aperture 50, which corresponds with aperture 44 of cover 32. Both apertures are arranged to cooperate with speaker 51.<br>
[0057] Fig. 4 is a perspective view of several components of first body 10 of FIG. 2, and FIG. 5 is a cross-sectional view of the first body taken along line 5-5 of FIG. 4. Note that housing 31 has been omitted from these figures for clarity.<br>
[0058] In accordance with an embodiment, cover 32 is shown being substantially planar, with display portion 40 and input regions 42 being integrally formed in the cover. Cover 32 may be formed from any suitably ridged material which is optically transmissive. Methyl methacrylate polymer is one example of material that may be used for the cover. In addition, frame 34 may be formed of a polycarbonate material which has high impact strength and heat resistance. Cover 32 is typically formed from a different material than that used for frame 34, but this is not a requirement.<br>
[0059] In an embodiment, cover 32 is formed from transparent material 36, and opaque material 38 is positioned on a surface of the transparent material. Input regions 42 and display portion 40 may be defined as areas of the cover which do not include the opaque material. Incident light will be transmitted by optically transmissive regions of the cover, and will not be transmitted by the portions of the cover which include the opaque material.<br>
9<br>
<br>
Various types, shapes, and numbers of touch keys may therefore be formed using this technique.<br>
[0060] If desired, opaque material 38 imay be coated on the surface of transparent member 36 as part of an in-mold injection process. In-mold injection can reduce the number of steps necessary to form cover 32, offering increased manufacturing efficiency and lower production costs. Each of the optically transmissive input regions may beishaped to define one or more of a character, a symbol, and a number, among others.<br>
[0061] If desired, one or more input regions 42 may be structured using a tactile element projecting from the cover. Each of these tactile elements may be individually associated with one of the input regions.<br>
[0062] Tactile elements enhance the user's ability to interact with the input regions. The tactile elements may be formed in a variety of different shapes (e. g., circular, triangular, rectagonal, polygonal, star-like, and the like), as needed or desired. The opaque material may be formed over the tactile elements, or such material can be omitted from these elements so that they remain optically transmissive.<br>
[0063] As an alternative to the use of adhesive 60 (or as a technique to enhance the effectiveness of the adhesive) coupling of cover 32 and frame 34 may be accomplished using cooperating pins and pin receptacles. For instance, cover 32 is shown having pins 56, which may be positioned around the perimeter of cover 32 in such a manner that they operatively couple with corresponding pin receptacles 58 of frame 34. Coupling of frame 34 to housing 31 may also be accomplished by cooperating pins and pin receptacles. For instance, pins may be used with pin receptacles 54 (frame 32) and pin receptacles 55 (housing 31).<br>
[0064] A body for a mobile device in accordance with an alternative embodiment of the present invention will be described in conjunction with FIGS. 6-9. In particular, FIG. 6<br>
10<br>
<br>
is an exploded perspective view of a first body, and FIG. 7 is a perspective view of the first body taken along line 7-7 of FtG. 6. FIG. 8 is an enlarged view of a portion of the first body shown in FIG. 7, and FIG. 9 is a cross-sectional view of the first body taken along line 7-7 of FIG. 6.<br>
[0065] As shown, first body 69 includes first housing 70 and second housing 71. The first housing may be formed from optically transmissive material (as previously described) and typically includes wall 80 which extends along a perimeter of the housing. Coupling structure 78 is shown located on an inner portion of this wall of the first housing. The coupling structure 78 may be used to couple the first and second housings. The coupling structure may be formed within first housing 70 using, for example, double injection molding techniques. Double injection is beneficial in this regard since it reduces processing steps, offering increased manufacturing efficiency and lower production costs.<br>
[0066] Wall 80 may be sized so that it extends past coupling structure 78. This permits the concealment of the coupling structure when the first and second housings 70, 71, are assembled. Typically, coupling structure 78 and first housing 70 are formed from different materials, but this is not a requirement.<br>
[0067] First housing 70 may be formed from optically transmissive material 36 onto which opaque material 38 has been introduced. Materials 36 and 38 may be implemented using any of the techniques previously described. As a result, optically transmissive input regions 42 and display region 40 may thus be formed. Coupling structure may be formed using, for example, polycarbonate material.<br>
[0068] Coupling of first and second housings 70, 71, may be accomplished using cooperating pins and pin receptacles. For instance, pin receptacles 79 are shown formed in coupling structure 78. Second housing 71 has corresponding pin receptacles 73 formed along<br>
11<br>
<br>
various locations of the interior perimeter. The first and second housings can thus be assembled using pins which cooperate with the various pin receptacles of these housings.<br>
[0069] FIG. 10 is a perspective view of a slide-type mobile device 89 in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 11 is a cross-sectional view taken along line 11-11 of FIG. 10. The embodiment of FIGS. 10 and 11 is similar in many respects to that which is depicted in FIGS. 2-5. One difference relates to the user interface implemented. In particular, cover 32 of mobile device 89 is shaped to define a plurality of openings 90. A corresponding plurality of keys 92 are individually associated with one of the plurality of openings of the cover. Each of the keys (e.g., push-type, wheel-type, and the like) is structured to individually generate signals responsive to user contact, such as by pressing or other manipulation. Alternatives include providing multiple keys for a single opening, and the use of only one opening sized to receive one or more keys. An advantage of these embodiments is that a separate key assembly (or assemblies) may be used in conjunction with cover 32.<br>
[0070] FIG. 12 is a perspective view of a housing assembly in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. FIG. 13 is a cross-sectional view of the housing assembly taken along line 13-13 of FIG. 12. The embodiment of FIGS. 12 and 13 is similar in many respects to that which is depicted in FIGS. 6-9. One difference relates to the user interface implemented.<br>
[0071] For instance, first housing 70 is shaped to define a plurality of openings 90. A corresponding plurality of keys 92 is associated with one of the plurality of openings of the cover. Each of the keys (e.g., push-type; wheel-type, and the like) is structured to individually generate signals responsive to user contact, such as by pressing or other manipulation. Alternatives include providing multiple keys for a single opening, and the use<br>
12<br>
<br>
of only one opening sized to receive one or more keys. Note that first housing 70 is typically configured with a suitable housing, such as second housing 71 (FIG. 6).<br>
[0072] FIG. 14 is a cross-sectional view of cover 150 in accordance with another alternative embodiment of the present invention. This example is similar is some respects to the cover depicted in FIG. 5. One difference is that coupling of cover 150 is facilitated by pin receptacles 162, which are located along a walled portion of the cover. These pin receptacles may be positioned around the perimeter of cover 150 in such a manner that they operatively couple, via pins, with corresponding pin receptacles located in a lower housing (e.g., second housing 71 of FIG. 6).<br>
[0073] Coupling of cover 150 is facilitated by pin receptacles 162, which are located along a walled portion of the cover. These pin receptacles may be positioned around the perimeter of cover 150 in such a manner that they operatively couple, via pins, with corresponding pin receptacles located in a lower housing (e.g., second housing 71 of FIG. 6). If desired, one or more input regions 42 may be structured as a tactile element projecting from the cover. Examples of such tactile elements are denoted as elements 160.<br>
[0074] FIG. 15 is a cross-sectional view of cover 170 in accordance with yet another alternative embodiment. This example is similar is some respects to the cover depicted in FIG. 14. One difference is that the input regions 42 of the cover of FIG. 14have been replaced with key buttons 92. For instance, cover 170 is shaped to define a plurality of openings 90. A corresponding plurality of keys 92 is associated with one of the plurality of openings of the cover. The keys and corresponding openings may be implemented using any of the techniques previously described.<br>
[0075] The foregoing embodiments and advantages are merely exemplary and are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The present teaching can be readily applied to other types of apparatuses and processes. The description of the present invention<br>
