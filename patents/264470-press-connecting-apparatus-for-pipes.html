				<td>[Technical Field]<br>
The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for press-connecting pipes, and more particularly, to a pipe press connection apparatus which has reduced parts in number and enhances space efficiency in a pipe-connecting process.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
In general, a press type pipe-connecting method using a pipe connector is performed so as to implement an easier connecting of pipes and so as to prevent a disengagement of a pipe or water leakage during a piping work.<br>
Figure 1 is a view illustrating a conventional pipe press connection apparatus. Figure 2 is a view illustrating a chain connection state of a pipe press connection apparatus of Figure 1.<br>
A conventional pipe press connection apparatus of Figures 1 and 2 is disclosed in the Korean Patent No. 10-0578450 (May 3, 2006). This apparatus has first and second fixing blocks 10 and 12, chain links 14, and circular blocks 16. Each chain link 14 is rotatably connected between the first and second fixing blocks 10 and 12. Each circular block 16 is engaged at an inner surface of each chain link 14 by means of an engaging member. The circular block 16 has circular grooves at its inner surface and is in contact with an outer surface of a pipe to be pressed.<br>
The conventional apparatus further has a connection link 15 for rotatably connecting the neighboring circular blocks 16, and a connection piece 13 for preventing an escape of the circular blocks 16.<br>
Such a conventional pipe press connection apparatus has several problems, as follows. Since the conventional apparatus is composed of many parts for press-connecting pipes, a process of producing and assembling such parts of the apparatus is so complicated. Furthermore, the parts of the conventional apparatus may be damaged or disassembled by a force applied in a pressing process.<br>
Figure 3 is a view illustrating a pressing tool connected with a pipe press connection apparatus of Figures 1 and 2 to apply a force for pressing a pipe.<br>
The pressing tool shown in Figure 3 drives the first and second fixing blocks 10 and 12 shown in Figure 1 so that the circular blocks 16 are pressed to or released from an outer surface of the pipe.<br>
The pressing tool includes a pair of first and second main blocks 20 and 21, which are rotatably connected with a fixing plate 24 by means of hinge pins 22 and 23. One ends of the main blocks 20 and 21 are connected with the first and second fixing blocks 10 and 12, respectively. The pressing tool also includes a cylinder (not shown) which allows the other ends of the main blocks 20 and 21 to come closer to each other or to come away from each other.<br>
An engaging hole 25 is formed at one end of the first main block 20 and is rotatably pin-connected with the connection hole 17 of the first fixing block 10 of Figure 1. Additionally, an engaging groove 26 is formed at one end of the second main block 21 and is engaged to or disengaged from the engaging pin 18 of the second fixing block 12.<br>
While the first fixing block 10 is fixedly connected with the first main block 20, the second fixing block 12 is detachably engaged with the second main block 21. When the cylinder rotatably drives the first and second main blocks 20 and 21, the first and second fixing blocks 10 and 12 come closer with each other. Therefore, the circular blocks 16 press the pipe, which is located within and contact with the circular blocks 16.<br>
As discussed heretofore, in the conventional pipe press connection apparatus, the connection hole 17 and the engaging pin 18 are respectively connected straight with the engaging hole 25 and the engaging groove 26 of the pressing tool. So the conventional pipe press connection apparatus allows a straight work only. If a working space is not enough to perform a straight work, it is impossible to carry out a pipe pressing work by using the conventional pipe press connection apparatus together with the pressing tool.<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pipe press connection apparatus that has reduced parts in number so as to decrease required steps in manufacture and assembly processes and to reduce a possibility of damages of parts.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a pipe press connection apparatus that allows a pipe pressing work even in a space not enough to perform a straight work and thereby enhances space efficiency in a pipe-connecting process.<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned and other objects, there is provided an apparatus for press-connecting pipes, the apparatus comprising a plurality of circular blocks, first and second reference blocks, a plurality of support blocks, and a plurality of chain links.<br>
The circular blocks are connected to each other by elastic couplers, forming a circular inner hole in which a pipe is inserted and located. Also the circular blocks are in contact with an outer surface of the pipe, and press the outer surface of the pipe when an external force is applied.<br>
The first and second reference blocks are in contact with an outer surface of at least one circular block, moving a little over the outer surface of the circular block by the external force while maintaining continuous contact. The reference blocks transfer the external force to the circular blocks, and each reference block has a first guide hole extended toward and overlapped with the circular blocks.<br>
The support blocks and the chain links are disposed over and in contact with the outer surface of the circular blocks. One of the support blocks is rotatably connected at one end to the first reference block and rotatably connected at the other end to one of the chain links. Another support block is rotatably connected at one end to the second reference block and rotatably connected at the other end to another chain link. The other support blocks are<br>
rotatably connected at both ends to the chain links. Each chain link has a second guide hole extended toward and overlapped with the circular blocks.<br>
In the apparatus of the invention, each of the first and second reference blocks may have a receptive groove formed on an outer surface thereof to receive an engaging end of a pressing tool that applies a force to the reference blocks. Each engaging end may have a male conical shape, and each receptive groove may have a female conical shape.<br>
In the apparatus of the invention, the elastic couplers may be springs inserted into and elastically connecting the adjacent circular blocks.<br>
In the apparatus of the invention, an inner surface of each circular block may have a rounded groove extended lengthwise and forming both protruded edges, which are substantially touched with the outer surface of the pipe.<br>
In the apparatus of the invention, each of the circular blocks may have pin holes and guide pins. The guide pins are located within the first and second guide holes and inserted into the pin holes.<br>
In the apparatus of the invention, each chain link may have connection holes, hinge pins, and fixing rings. Furthermore, each reference block and each support block may have connection holes corresponding to the connection holes of the chain links. Each connection hole of the chain link coincides with the connection hole of the reference block or the support block. Each hinge pin is inserted into the coinciding connection holes. The fixing rings are inserted onto circumferential grooves respectively formed near both ends of the hinge pin to prevent the escape of the hinge pin from the connection holes.<br>
The pipe press connection apparatus of the present invention is characterized by integrally organized but simply structured chain links and identically molded support blocks. Accordingly, the apparatus of the invention requires reduced parts in number and reduced steps in manufacture and assembly processes. Because of reduced number, the parts of the apparatus have also a reduced possibility of damages.<br>
In addition, the pipe press connection apparatus of the present invention<br>
is characterized by the conical shaped receptive groove allowing a non-straight or nonlinear engagement of the engaging ends of the pressing tool. Accordingly, the apparatus of the invention can be used for a free-directional pipe pressing work even in a space not enough to perform a straight work.<br>

[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers are given to the same elements. The detailed descriptions on the known function and construction, which may make the gist of the present invention unclear, will be omitted.<br>
Referring to Figures 4 to 9, a pipe press connection apparatus 100 according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes first and second reference blocks 110 and 120, circular blocks 160, support blocks 180, and chain links 190.<br>
The circular blocks 160 are connected to each other by elastic couplers (e.g., springs 168 in Figure 7), forming a circular inner hole 170. A pipe (not shown) is inserted and located in the inner hole 170 formed by the circular blocks 160, and an outer surface of the pipe is in contact with the circular blocks 160. When an external force is applied, the circular blocks 160 become much closer to each other through their sliding movements over the outer surface of the pipe and thereby press the pipe in the inner hole 170.<br>
The first and second reference blocks 110 and 120 are in contact with an outer surface of at least one circular block 160, and move a little over the outer surface of the circular block 160 by an external force while maintaining continuous contact. Each reference block 110 and 120 has a guide hole 140<br>
extended toward and overlapped with the circular blocks 160 so as to guide such a sliding movement and to maintain continuous contact without separation. The first and second reference blocks 110 and 120 transfer an external force (e.g., applied by a pressing tool 500 in Figure 12) to the circular blocks 160.<br>
The support blocks 180 and the chain links 190, together with the reference blocks 110 and 120, are disposed over and in contact with the outer surface of the circular blocks 160. One of the support blocks 180 is rotatably connected at one end to the first reference block 110 and rotatably connected at the other end to one of the chain links 190. Similarly, another support block 180 is rotatably connected at one end to the second reference block 120 and rotatably connected at the other end to another chain link 190. The other support blocks 180 are rotatably connected at both ends to the chain links 190.<br>
The support blocks 180 support left and right sliding movements of the circular blocks 160 by a force transferred from the first and second reference blocks 110 and 120. Like the guide hole 140 of the reference block 110 and 120, each chain link 190 has a guide hole 198 extended toward and overlapped with the circular blocks 160 to guide a sliding movement and to maintain continuous contact without separation.<br>
As discussed above and shown in Figure 7, the spring 168 is inserted into and elastically connects the adjacent circular blocks 160. The circular blocks 160 form the circular inner hole 170 into which a pipe to be pressed is inserted. An inner surface of each circular block 160 has a rounded groove 162 extended lengthwise and forming both protruded edges, which are substantially touched with the outer surface of the pipe.<br>
Each circular block 160 has pin holes 164 into which guide pins 166 are inserted. These guide pins 166 are located within the guide holes 140 and 198 formed respectively in the reference blocks 110 and 120 and the chain links 190. The guide pines 166 in the guide holes 140 and 198 prevent the reference blocks 110 and 120 and the chain links 190 from being separated from the circular blocks 160.<br>
As shown in Figures 4, 5, 6 and 9, each of the reference blocks 110 and 120 has a receptive groove 130 formed on an outer surface thereof. As shown in Figures 12 and 13, the receptive grooves 130 receive engaging ends 540 of the pressing tool 500 that applies a force to the reference blocks 110 and 120. Each engaging end 540 of the pressing tool 500 has a male conical shape, and each receptive groove 130 of the reference blocks 110 and 120 has a female conical shape. Therefore, the pressing tool 500 can be connected in a free direction with the reference blocks 110 and 120.<br>
Each chain link 190 has connection holes 196, hinge pins 194, and fixing rings 192. As shown in Figure 9 but not designated by reference numerals, each reference block 110 and 120 and each support block 180 have also connection holes corresponding to the connection holes 196 of the chain links 190. Each connection hole 196 of the chain link 190 coincides with the connection hole of the reference block 110 and 120 or the support block 180, and then the hinge pin 194 is inserted into the coinciding holes. Therefore, the chain links 190 are rotatably connected to the reference blocks 110 and 120 and the support blocks 180 as discussed above. The fixing rings 192 are inserted onto circumferential grooves respectively formed near both ends of the hinge pin 194, thereby preventing the escape of the hinge pin 194 from the connection holes.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, the pipe press connection apparatus of the present invention may further have a protection cover 150, which has a C-like shape and covers outer surfaces of the support blocks 180.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, all the support blocks 180 have the same shape formed in a single mold. Additionally, the connection piece 13, the chain link 14, and the connection link 15 of the conventional apparatus shown in Figure 2 are integrated into the chain link 190 of the invention.<br>
Therefore, the pipe press connection apparatus of the invention requires reduced parts in number and reduced steps in manufacture and assembly processes.<br>
The inner diameter of the apparatus is determined depending on the outer diameter of the pipe inserted into the circular inner hole 170.<br>
Figures 10 and 11 show a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to Figures 10 and 11, the apparatus of the second embodiment is different from that of the first embodiment in the configuration of the support blocks. That is, while the support block 180 of the first embodiment has a single-layered configuration, the support block 280 of the second embodiment has a multi-layered configuration.<br>
Figures 12 and 13 show two examples of a pipe press work in which a pressing tool is engaged with a pipe press connection apparatus of Figure 4. Specifically, Figure 12 shows a straight or linear engagement, and Figure 13 shows a non-straight or nonlinear engagement.<br>
As shown in Figures 12 and 13, the pressing tool 500 has first and second main blocks 510 and 520, each of which has the engaging end 540. The first and second main blocks 510 and 520 are coupled to each other through a connection plate 530. The engaging end 540 has a male conical shape.<br>
The engaging ends 540 of the pressing tool 500 are inserted into the receptive grooves 130 on the reference blocks 110 and 120 of the apparatus 100. Since the engaging end 540 and the receptive groove 130 have corresponding male and female conical shapes, the engaging end 540 can be freely rotated in the receptive groove 130. That is, the pressing tool 500 can change an engaging direction with the apparatus 100.<br>
An outer end, opposite to the engaging end 540, of each main block 510 and 520 has an inwardly rounded surface. A driving cylinder (not shown) is inserted between both outer ends of the main blocks 510 and 520, and then slides toward the connection plate 530 along the inwardly rounded surfaces of the outer ends. Therefore, a space between the outer ends of the main blocks 510 and 520 becomes wider, and the engaging ends 540 apply a force to the reference blocks 110 and 120 through the receptive grooves 130.<br>
As fully described heretofore, the pipe press connection apparatus 100<br>
according to the present invention is characterized by integrally organized but simply structured chain links 190 and identically molded support blocks 180. Accordingly, the apparatus of the invention requires reduced parts in number and reduced steps in manufacture and assembly processes. Because of reduced number, the parts of the apparatus have also a reduced possibility of damages.<br>
In addition, the pipe press connection apparatus 100 of the present invention is characterized by the conical shaped receptive groove 130 allowing a non-straight or nonlinear engagement of the engaging ends 540 of the pressing tool 500. Accordingly, the apparatus of the invention can be used for a free-directional pipe pressing work even in a space not enough to perform a straight work.<br>
As the present invention may be embodied in several forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof, it should also be understood that the above-described examples are not limited by any of the details of the foregoing description, unless otherwise specified, but rather should be construed broadly within its spirit and scope as defined in the appended claims, and therefore all changes and modifications that fall within the meets and bounds of the claims, or equivalences of such meets and bounds are therefore intended to be embraced by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
