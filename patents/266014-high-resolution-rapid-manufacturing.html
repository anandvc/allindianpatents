BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
		The present invention relates to the fabrication of three-<br>
dimensional objects from computer designs using additive process<br>
techniques. In particular, the present invention relates to the rapid<br>
manufacturing of three-dimensional objects using fused deposition<br>
modeling and jetting techniques.<br>
Rapid prototyping of three-dimensional objects from<br>
computer-generated designs is used to form parts for a variety of<br>
functions, such as aesthetic judgments, proofing a mathematical model,<br>
concept visualization, forming hard tooling, studying interference and<br>
space allocation, and testing functionality. Rapid prototyping techniques<br>
have also spread into rapid manufacturing markets, where copies of an<br>
object are quickly created, and each object exhibits physical properties<br>
comparable to objects made from hard tooling.<br>
Rapid manufacturing applications demand a high<br>
throughput, a good surface finish, and strengths, toughness, and<br>
chemical resistance equaling that of injection-molded parts. To achieve<br>
the desired functional qualities, it is desirable to build rapid manufactured<br>
objects out of thermoplastic materials, such as acrylonitrile butadiene<br>
styrene (ABS), polycarbonate, and polysulfone, all of which exhibit good<br>
physical properties.<br>
Fused deposition modeling is a popular rapid prototyping<br>
technique developed by Stratasys, Inc., Eden Prairie, MN, which builds<br>
three-dimensional objects from thermoplastics materials. Fused<br>
deposition modeling machines build three-dimensional objects by<br>
extruding flowable modeling material (e.g., thermoplastic materials)<br>
through a nozzle carried by an extrusion head, and depositing the<br><br>
2<br>
modeling material in a predetermined pattern onto a base. The modeling<br>
material is extruded in fluent strands, referred to as "roads". Typically, the<br>
object is formed in a layer-wise fashion by depositing a sequence of<br>
roads in an x-y plane, incrementing the position of the extrusion head<br>
along a z-axis (perpendicular to the x-y plane), and then repeating the<br>
process. Movement of the extrusion head with respect to the base is<br>
performed under computer control, in accordance with design data<br>
provided from a computer aided design (CAD) system. The extruded<br>
modeling material fuses to previously deposited modeling material, and<br>
solidifies upon a drop in temperature to form a three-dimensional object<br>
resembling the CAD model.<br>
Another technique for building objects from solidifiable<br>
materials is known as jetting, which deposits droplets of modeling<br>
material from nozzles of a jetting head, such as an inkjet printhead. After<br>
dispensing, the jetted material is solidified (e.g., cured by exposing the<br>
material to ultraviolet radiation).<br>
The surfaces of three-dimensional objects developed from<br>
layered manufacturing techniques of the current art (e.g., fused<br>
deposition modeling and jetting) are textured or striated due to their<br>
layered formation. Curved and angled surfaces generally have a "stair<br>
step" appearance, caused by layering of cross-sectional shapes which<br>
have square edge profiles. Although the stair-stepping does not effect<br>
the strength of the object, it does detract aesthetically. Generally, the<br>
stair-stepping effect is proportional to the layer thickness, and decreases<br>
as the layer thickness decreases.<br>
Current fused deposition modeling machines, such as<br>
systems commercially available from Stratasys, Inc., build three-<br>
dimensional objects having layer thicknesses ranging from about 180<br><br>
3<br>
micrometers (about 0.007 inches) to about 760 micrometers (about 0.030<br>
inches) and road widths ranging from about 125 micrometers (about<br>
0.005 inches) to about 1500 micrometers (about 0.060 inches).<br>
Thermoplastic materials flow through extrusion tips having inner<br>
diameters typically ranging from about 125 micrometers (about 0.005<br>
inches) to about 500 micrometers (about 0.020 inches), at dispensing<br>
rates designed to produce the desired layer thicknesses and road widths.<br>
The fused deposition modeling machines generally operate<br>
at voxel rates of about 500 hertz (Hz), extruding thermoplastic materials<br>
at a dispensing rate of about three cubic inches per hour. The resulting<br>
object resolution is generally about 130 micrometers (about 0.005<br>
inches), depending on the object geometry. The high viscosities of<br>
thermoplastic materials (e.g., about 500 Poise) and their low thermal<br>
conductivities (e.g., about 0.2 watts/meter-EC) generally constrains the<br>
extrusion of these plastics through a smaller extrusion tip (to produce<br>
thinner layers) while moving the extruder at a higher frequency (to<br>
decrease build time).<br>
Jetting techniques of the current art can eject small droplets<br>
of material at a voxel rate of about 2 kilohertz (kHz) to about 200 kHz.<br>
The thicknesses of jetted layers generally range from about 5<br>
micrometers (about 0.0002 inches) to about 150 micrometers (about<br>
0.006 inches), with a typical thickness before planarization of about 25<br>
micrometers (about 0.001 inches). Accordingly, the resulting object<br>
resolution is generally about 50 micrometers (about 0.002 inches),<br>
depending on the object geometry. However, known jettable materials do<br>
not have the desirable material properties of the extrudable thermoplastic<br>
materials. As such, jetted objects are generally less suitable for rapid<br>
manufacturing applications. There is a need for techniques that increase<br><br>
4<br>
the speed and resolution of building three-dimensional objects from<br>
materials that exhibit good physical properties, such as thermoplastic<br>
materials.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system that<br>
provide a high-resolution, rapidly manufactured, three-dimensional object<br>
by combining jetting techniques with the principles of fused deposition<br>
modeling. A first material is jetted to form a plurality of layers that define<br>
an increment of a support structure. The jetting allows the increment of<br>
the support structure to have a high-resolution interior surface.<br>
A second material is extruded to form a layer of the three-<br>
dimensional object, where the layer of the three-dimensional object<br>
substantially conforms to the high-resolution interior surface of the<br>
increment of the support structure. The jetting and the extrusion are<br>
repeated until the three-dimensional object and the support structure are<br>
formed. Accordingly, the support structure functions as a high-resolution<br>
mold that is filled concurrently with its construction. This allows three-<br>
dimensional objects to be formed from materials with good physical<br>
properties, at high deposition rates, and with high surface resolutions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIGS. 1 and 2 are respectively a side view and a front view<br>
of a three-dimensional modeling system 10, which is an apparatus for<br>
manufacturing three-dimensional objects pursuant to the present<br>
invention. The system 10 includes a build chamber 12, a controller 14, a<br>
CAD system 16, a material supply portion 18, and a circulation system<br>
20.<br>
The build chamber 12 includes chamber walls 22 and an<br>
interior portion 24 disposed within the chamber walls 22. The interior<br>
portion 24 is shown as a broken away portion in FIGS. 1 and 2. Within<br><br>
6<br>
the interior portion 24, the build chamber 12 also includes a jetting head<br>
26, a planarizer 28, an extrusion head 30, guide rails 32, a platform 34, a<br>
support structure 36, and a three-dimensional object 38. As discussed<br>
below, the jetting head 26 jets a support material onto the platform 34 to<br>
build the support structure 36 in increments. Interspersed with the jetting<br>
of the support structure 36, the extrusion head 30 extrudes a modeling<br>
material onto the platform 34 to build the object 38 within the support<br>
structure 36.<br>
The jetting head 26 and the planarizer 28 are coupled<br>
together as a single unit, and are supported by the guide rails 32, which<br>
extend along a y-axis within the build chamber 12. This allows the jetting<br>
head 26 and the planarizer 28 to move back-and-forth along the y-axis.<br>
The extrusion head 30 is supported by the guide rails 32 and by<br>
additional guide rails 40, where the additional guide rails 40 extend along<br>
an x-axis within the build chamber 12. The guide rails 32 and 40 allow<br>
the extrusion head 30 to move in any direction in a plane defined by the<br>
x-axis and the y-axis.<br>
The platform 34 provides a working surface for building the<br>
support structure 36 and the object 38, and is disposed below the jetting<br>
head 26, the planarizer 28, and the extrusion head 30 in a direction along<br>
a z-axis. The height of the platform 34 along the z-axis may be adjusted<br>
in a conventional manner to vary the distance between the platform 34<br>
and the jetting head 26, the planarizer 28, and the extrusion head 30.<br>
The material supply portion 18 includes a support material<br>
supply 42, a modeling material supply 44, a support material supply line<br>
46, a support material return line 48, and a modeling material supply line<br>
50. The support material supply 42 is connected to the jetting head 26 of<br>
the build chamber 12 with the support material supply line 46, which<br><br>
7<br>
allows support material stored in the support material supply 42 to be<br>
pumped to the jetting head 26. Support material left unused after building<br>
the support structure 36 may be transported back to the support material<br>
supply 42 via the support material return line 48. The modeling material<br>
supply 44 is connected to the extrusion head 30 of the build chamber 12<br>
with the modeling material supply line 50, which allows modeling material<br>
stored in the modeling material supply 44 to be transferred to the<br>
extrusion head 30.<br>
The circulation system 20 includes a vacuum 54, a cooling<br>
fan 56, a vacuum conduit 58, and a cooling conduit 60. The vacuum 54 is<br>
connected to the planarizer 28 of the build chamber 16 with the vacuum<br>
conduit 58. Similarly, the cooling fan 56 is connected to the extrusion<br>
head 30 of the build chamber 16 with the cooling conduit 60. The cooling<br>
fan 56 provides cool air to the extrusion head 30 to maintain the extrusion<br>
head 30 at a desired temperature.<br>
The jetting head 26 of the build chamber 12 includes an<br>
array of downward facing jets 62, which eject droplets of support material<br>
according to a predetermined pattern to build the support structure 36,<br>
layer-by-layer. In the present embodiment, the jets 62 span the entire<br>
work space in single array. In order to nullify the effects of a<br>
malfunctioning nozzle (e.g., a clogged or dead nozzle), the jetting head<br>
26 may shift along the x-axis to randomize the locations of the jets 62<br>
relative to the work space. This may be accomplished with the use of<br>
third set of guide rails (not shown) that extend along the x-axis, parallel to<br>
the guide rails 40 for the extrusion head 30. In alternative embodiments,<br>
the jets 62 may only span a portion of the work space, with the jetting<br>
head 26 making multiple passes in order to cover the entire work space at<br>
each incremental height along the z-axis (e.g., raster scan and interlaced<br><br>
8<br>
raster scan patterns). Additionally, the jets 62 may be offset at an angle<br>
from the x-axis to increase the resolution of each pass (e.g., a saber<br>
angle).<br>
The jetting head 26 may be a commercial inkjet printhead,<br>
such as trade designated GALAXY, NOVA, and SPECTRA<br>
printheads/jetting assemblies, all of which are commercially available<br>
from Spectra, Inc. Lebanon, NH. In one embodiment, the jetting head 26<br>
uses drop-on-demand technology. A typical jetting head of the current<br>
art, using drop-on-demand technology, reliably ejects droplets with about<br>
38 micrometer diameters at a rate of about three kHz per nozzle, and has<br>
a nozzle density of more than 300 nozzles per inch. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, the jetting head 26 uses continuous drop technology.<br>
Continuous drop technology generally provides a higher throughput, but<br>
the droplet size has more variability. In another alternative embodiment,<br>
the jetting head 26 may be customized and/or may have as few as one<br>
jet. For example, the jetting head 26 may move rapidly along the y-axis<br>
and electrostatically deflect droplets into position.<br>
In the jetting heads of the current art, the droplets ejected<br>
exhibit variable sizes, which results in a deposition rate uncertainty. To<br>
address this uncertainty, the jetting head 26 is calibrated to over-deposit<br>
the support material. The excess material may then be subsequently<br>
removed by the planarizer 28. The planarizer 28 may be any instrument<br>
suitable for planarizing the deposited layers. In the present embodiment,<br>
the planarizer 28 is a rotating cutter, which planarizes layers the support<br>
structure by physically cutting away the support material. Alternatively,<br>
the planarizer 28 may be solvent-assisted lapping planarizer, which<br>
incorporates a solvent-coated roller that dissolve portions of the support<br>
structure 36. This is particularly suitable for use with small features of the<br><br>
9<br>
support structure 36, which may otherwise be damaged by the shear<br>
forces induced by conventional planarizers. Another alternative for the<br>
planarizer 28 includes a smooth roller that is particularly suitable for use<br>
with certain materials of the support structure 36, as discussed below.<br>
The planarizer 28 desirably extends slightly below the jetting<br>
head 14. In this arrangement, the jetted support material is planarized<br>
when it builds up to a height along the z-axis equal to the height of the<br>
planarizer 28. This prevents the jets 62 from colliding with the jetted<br>
layers of the support structure 36. In alternative embodiments, the<br>
planarizer 28 may be de-coupled from the jetting head 26, allowing the<br>
planarizer 28 to be positionable at various heights along the z-axis. This<br>
provides control of the intervals at which the planarizer 28 acts upon the<br>
jetted support material.<br>
The support material removed by the planarizer 28 is<br>
withdrawn from the build chamber 16 through the vacuum conduit 58 by<br>
the vacuum 54. The vacuum 46 pulls material away from the build<br>
chamber 16 as the material is removed by the planarizer 28. The<br>
planarizer 28 and the vacuum 54 may be any suitable planarizer system<br>
for planarizing and removing excess support material. For example, in<br>
lieu of the vacuum 54, a negatively-charged static roller may be used to<br>
collect and remove the excess support material while the planarizer 28 is<br>
in use.<br>
The extrusion head 30 may be of any type that receives a<br>
thermoplastic material and dispenses the thermoplastic material in a<br>
molten state, such as an extrusion head for fuse deposition modeling.<br>
The extrusion head 30 includes an extrusion tip 64, which extrudes bulk<br>
layers of modeling material according to a predetermined pattern to build<br>
the object 38, layer-by-layer. In one embodiment of the present invention,<br><br>
10<br>
the extrusion tip 64 of the extrusion head 30 may include a large orifice,<br>
capable of extruding thicker bulk layers of modeling material than<br>
generally used with existing fuse deposition modeling systems.<br>
An example of a suitable thickness for the bulk layers of<br>
modeling material includes about 760 micrometers (0.03 inches). This is<br>
several times greater than used with current fuse deposition modeling<br>
systems. The terms "thickness" and "layer thickness" are defined herein<br>
as distances along the z-axis shown in FIGS 1 and 2. The large orifices<br>
of the extrusion tip 64 also allow the extrusion rates of the modeling<br>
material to be higher than the rates of existing fuse deposition modeling<br>
systems. An example of a suitable extrusion flow rate from the extrusion<br>
tip 64 includes at least about 1.6 liters/hour (about 100 inches3 /hour). In<br>
comparison, extrusion rates of existing fuse deposition modeling systems<br>
are about 0.05 liters/hours (about 3 inches3/hour).<br>
The jetting head 26, the planarizer 28, the extrusion head<br>
30, and the platform 34 of the build chamber 14 are each managed by the<br>
controller 14. The controller 14 may be any suitable computer system for<br>
receiving data from the CAD system 16 and directing deposition and<br>
planarization patterns for the support structure 36 and the object 38.<br>
The CAD system 16 provides a digital representation of the<br>
object 38 to the controller 14, from which the extrusion pattern for the<br>
extrusion head 30 is determined. The CAD system 16 also creates a<br>
digital representation of the support structure 36 from the digital<br>
representation of the object 38. In one embodiment, the CAD system 16<br>
first identifies data representing an exterior surface of the object 38. The<br>
CAD system 16 then creates the digital representation of the support<br>
structure 36 in which the support structure 36 has an interior surface with<br>
a geometry defined by the data representing the exterior surface of the<br><br>
11<br>
object 38. As such, the support structure 36 is designed as a matching<br>
mold for the object 38. The CAD system 16 provides the digital<br>
representation of the support structure 36 to the controller 14, from which<br>
the jetting pattern for the jetting head 26 is determined.<br>
As used herein, the term "exterior surface" of the object 38<br>
includes all surfaces of the object 38 that are exposed to external<br>
conditions, such as the geometric outside surface of the object 38,<br>
exposed hollow portions of the object 38, and exposed channels that<br>
extend within the object 38. As used herein, the term "interior surface" of<br>
the support structure 36 includes all surfaces of the support structure 36<br>
that geometrically correspond to the exterior surface of the object 38.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the controller 14 and the CAD<br>
system 16 may be a single system that provides the digital<br>
representations of the support structure 36 and the object 38, and<br>
manages the components of the system 10. Additionally, the digital<br>
representation of the support structure 36 may be created through a<br>
variety of data manipulation techniques.<br>
The interior region 24 of the build chamber 12 is desirably<br>
maintained at a temperature greater than the creep-relaxation<br>
temperature of the modeling material. Building the object 38 in an<br>
environment with a temperature higher than the creep-relaxation<br>
temperature of the modeling material, followed by a gradual cooling,<br>
relieves stresses imposed on the object 38. If the environment is too<br>
cool, the thermal gradient between the newly-extruded hot modeling<br>
material and the cooled pre-existing modeling material, together with the<br>
thermal expansion coefficient of the modeling material, generates a warp<br>
or curl. On the other hand, if the environment is too hot, the modeling<br>
material will not adequately solidify, and the object 38 will droop.<br><br>
12<br>
Examples of suitable temperatures for the interior region 24<br>
of the build chamber 16 range from about the solidification temperature of<br>
the modeling material to about the glass transition temperature of the<br>
modeling material. Examples of particularly suitable temperatures for the<br>
build chamber 16 range from about the creep-relaxation temperature of<br>
the modeling material to about the glass transition temperature of the<br>
modeling material.<br>
When the interior region 24 of the build chamber 16 is<br>
maintained at about the glass transition temperature of the modeling<br>
material, the modeling material slumps and substantially conforms to the<br>
interior surface of the support structure 36. As such, the support structure<br>
36 functions in a similar manner to a mold of an injection molding<br>
process. However, in contrast to the high pressures at which plastic are<br>
shot into an injection mold, the extruded roads of modeling material in the<br>
present invention will exert low pressures (primarily hydrostatic<br>
pressures) on the support structure 36. Therefore, the support structure<br>
36 is only required to exhibit moderate strengths to support the object 38.<br>
It is desirable to thermally isolate the jetting head 26 from<br>
the interior region 24 of the build chamber 16. Prolonged high<br>
temperatures may potentially degrade the support materials and/or the<br>
jetting head 26. Various means may be used to shield the jetting head<br>
26 from the heat. For example, the jetting head 26 may be cooled by<br>
pumping cool air with the a second cooling fan (not shown) that shares<br>
the vacuum conduit 58 with the vacuum 54. Other shielding techniques<br>
may be used, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, including a<br>
deformable baffle insulator, as is disclosed in Swanson et al., U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,722,872, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br><br>
13<br>
In order to accurately build the support structure 36 and the<br>
object 38, the controller 14 registers the relative positions between the<br>
jetting head 26 (in directions along the y-axis) and the extrusion head 30<br>
(in directions along the x-axis and the y-axis). Sensors may communicate<br>
with the controller 14 to perform registration on start-up, and to monitor<br>
registration of the jetting head 26 and the extrusion head 30 during a build<br>
process.<br>
When implementing the present invention, the planarizer 28<br>
is desirably positioned to avoid collisions with the object 38. Similarly, the<br>
extrusion tip 64 of the extrusion head 30 is desirably positioned to avoid<br>
collisions with the support structure 36. In one embodiment, the<br>
planarizer 28 planarizes the jetted support material to a height along the<br>
z-axis that is slightly below the position of the extrusion tip 64. This<br>
effectively prevents the extrusion tip 64 from colliding with the support<br>
structure 36 as the extrusion head 30 travels across the work space. In<br>
an alternative embodiment, collision may be avoided by lowering the<br>
platform 34 before the extrusion and raising it back up after the extrusion<br>
is completed.<br>
In addition to avoiding collision, registration is also important<br>
for building the support structure 36 and the object 38 with accurate<br>
geometries. In order to ensure that the layers of support material and<br>
modeling material are progressing at the same height along the z-axis.<br>
registration must be maintained between the planarizer 28 and the<br>
extrusion tip 64 of the extrusion head 30. As such, the system 10 of the<br>
present invention may include sensors to register and to maintain<br>
registration between the various components of the system 10 to avoid<br>
collisions, and to monitor the deposited materials.<br><br>
14<br>
FIG. 3 is an illustration of the layers of the support structure<br>
36 and the object 38 being monitored by a camera 76. The camera 76 is<br>
an optical ranging sensor that maintains registration during a build<br>
process by monitoring the relative heights of the support structure 36 and<br>
the object 38. The camera 76 senses the heights along the z-axis of the<br>
support structure 36 and the object 38. The camera 76 then compares<br>
the heights to determine if further jetting, extrusion, planarization, or other<br>
actions should be taken. Feedback from sensors, such as the camera<br>
76, may also be used to determine how many layers of support material<br>
are jetted. If the height of the support structure 36 is below a desired<br>
height, additional layers of support material may be jetted and planarized.<br>
Alternatively, if the height of the support structure exceeds a desired<br>
height, subsequent jetting of layers of support material may be halted.<br>
The system 10 allows the formation of the support structure<br>
36 and the object 38 pursuant to the present invention. Based on the<br>
digital representation of the support structure 36, the jetting head 26 jets<br>
support material to build the support structure 36. Similarly, based on the<br>
digital representation of the object 38, the extrusion head 30 extrudes<br>
modeling material to build the object 38. This build process allows the<br>
support structure 36 to function as a high resolution mold for the object<br>
38.<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a build process of the support<br>
structure 36 and the object 38 with the system 10 described in FIGS. 1<br>
and 2. FIG. 3 includes building steps 66a-66d, in which the support<br>
structure 36 and the object 38 are built on the platform 34, where the<br>
support structure 36 has an high-resolution interior surface 68. In step<br>
66a, the jet 64 deposits support material to form a jetted layer 70. This<br>
further increases the height of the support structure 36 along the z-axis.<br><br>
15<br>
In step 66b, the support material of the jetted layer 70 substantially<br>
solidifies, which may be performed in a variety of manners depending of<br>
the support material used. Steps 66a and 66b are then repeated to form<br>
N jetted layers of support material until a desired increment is reached,<br>
where the desired increment has a thickness in a direction along the z-<br>
axis. In one embodiment, N is an integer value of at least four (i.e., at<br>
least four jetted layers are deposited). In another embodiment, N is an<br>
integer value of at least ten (i.e., at least ten jetted layers are deposited).<br>
The "substantial solidifying" of the jetted layers (e.g.. the<br>
jetted layer 70) does not require that the support materials be completely<br>
solidified before the subsequent jetted layer is deposited. The present<br>
invention only requires that the layers of the support structure 58 are<br>
capable of supporting subsequently deposited layers of the support<br>
structure 58 and of supporting the object 56.<br>
As shown in step 66c, after the desired increment of the<br>
support structure 36 is reached, the planarizer 28 planarizes the<br>
deposited support material. The dislodged material is then removed form<br>
the build chamber 12 by the vacuum 54. In a typical jetting process of the<br>
current art, the planarizing step removes from about 5% to about 50% of<br>
a jetted layer's thickness, with a typical value of about 20%. Planarizing<br>
after multiple layers of support material are jetted provides the benefit that<br>
it is forgiving of small errors in the heights of the extruded layers of<br>
modeling material. This is because planarizing the jetted support material<br>
only after jetting several layers will generally avoid collision by the<br>
planarizer 26 with the previously extruded layers of modeling material.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the height of the planarizer 28<br>
may be set such that each layer of support material will be planarized<br>
after being jetted, and prior to jetting the subsequent layer of support<br><br>
16<br>
material. In this case, care must be taken to ensure that the height of the<br>
extruded layers of modeling material remains below the planarizer 28,<br>
such as by using sensors.<br>
As shown in step 66d, after planarization, the jetted layers<br>
are reduced to a support structure increment 72 having a thickness t.<br>
The extrusion head 30 then extrudes modeling material to fill the support<br>
structure 36 and build the object 56. Inside the extrusion head 30, the<br>
modeling material is heated to a flowable temperature (typically between<br>
about 180°C and about 300°C, depending on the modeling material being<br>
extruded). The incoming modeling material itself acts as a piston,<br>
creating a pumping action that forces the melted modeling material to<br>
extrude from the extrusion tip 64 of the extrusion head 30. The modeling<br>
material is extruded adjacent to the interior surface 68 of the support<br>
structure increment 72, to form a bulk layer 74 having a thickness t'. In<br>
one embodiment of the present invention, the layer thickness t' for each<br>
bulk layer of modeling material (e.g., the bulk layer 74) is approximately<br>
equal to the layer thickness t for the corresponding support structure<br>
increment (e.g., the support structure increment 72).<br>
Steps 66a-66d are then continued, building and filling the<br>
support structure 36, increment-by-increment, until the object 38 is<br>
complete. The support structure according to the present invention (e.g.,<br>
the support structure 36) may be immersive (i.e., fully surrounding the<br>
completed object 38), omitted from the top and bottom surfaces of the<br>
object 38, or omitted from the top surface of the object 38.<br>
FIG. 5 is an illustration of a support structure increment of<br>
the support structure 36 and the object 38, as described in FIG. 4. As<br>
shown, the support structure 36 is formed from twenty-four jetted layers<br>
36a-36x of support material, and includes the interior surface 68. The<br><br>
17<br>
object 38 is formed from three bulk layers 38a-38c of modeling material.<br>
The dotted lines illustrate the initial shape of the bulk layers 38a-38c upon<br>
extrusion. As discussed above, the interior region 24 of the build<br>
chamber 12 may be maintained at a temperature that causes the<br>
modeling material to slump and substantially conform to the interior<br>
surface 68 of the support structure 36. This allows the object 38 to be<br>
built with an exterior surface defined by the high resolution interior surface<br>
68 of the support structure 36. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 5, eight<br>
jetted layers (e.g., the jetted layers 38a-38h) are jetted per extruded bulk<br>
layer (e.g., the bulk layer 38a). As such, the surface resolution of the<br>
object 38 is increased eight-fold by imposing the jetted layer resolution on<br>
the extruded bulk layers 38a-38c.<br>
After the support structure 36 and the object 38 are built,<br>
they may be removed from the heated environment of the build chamber<br>
12 as a joined block. At this point, there may be thermal gradients in the<br>
block that can generate significant forces on the support structure 36 as<br>
the molding material solidifies. The cooling time required to prevent<br>
significant thermal gradients generally depends on the size of the object<br>
38. However, by the time the modeling material can generate significant<br>
force, the modeling material is generally rigid enough to retain its shape<br>
even if the support material cracks. Additionally, the use of support<br>
materials with high thermal conductivities may increase the uniform<br>
cooling of the object 38. Alternatively, after the support structure 36 and<br>
the object 38 are constructed, holes may be formed through the support<br>
structure 36 to allow coolant fluids to flow through. This may also<br>
increase the uniform cooling of the object 38.<br>
Upon completion, the support structure 36 may be removed<br>
in any manner that does not substantially damage the object 38.<br><br>
18<br>
Examples of suitable techniques for removing the support structure 36<br>
from the object 38 include physical removal (i.e., breaking the support<br>
structure 36 apart with applied force), dissolving at least a portion of the<br>
support structure in a solvent (discussed below), and combinations<br>
thereof. After the support structure 36 is removed, the object 38 is<br>
completed, and may undergo conventional post-building steps as<br>
individual needs may require.<br>
Examples of suitable modeling materials for use with the<br>
present invention include any material that is extrudable with a fused<br>
deposition modeling system. Examples of particularly suitable molding<br>
materials include thermoplastic materials, such as ABS, polycarbonate,<br>
polysulfone, and combinations thereof. The modeling material may be<br>
supplied from the modeling material supply 44 in the form of a flexible<br>
filament wound on a supply reel, or in the form of a solid rod, as disclosed<br>
in Crump, U.S. Patent No. 5,121,329, which is incorporated by reference<br>
in its entirety. Alternatively, the modeling material may be pumped in<br>
liquid form from a reservoir.<br>
The modeling materials may also be moisture sensitive. To<br>
protect the integrity of moisture-sensitive modeling materials, the<br>
modeling material supply 44 may be kept dry using an air tight filament<br>
loading and drying system, such as is disclosed in Swanson et al., U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,685,866, which is incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
Examples of suitable support materials for use with the<br>
present invention include any material that is jettable from an inkjet<br>
printhead and that exhibits sufficient strength to support the modeling<br>
material during the building process, such as solvent-dispersed materials,<br>
ultraviolet-curable materials, and combinations thereof. The support<br><br>
19<br>
materials also desirably solidify quickly with a good surface finish, have<br>
low deposition viscosities, are low cost, exhibit low environmental impact<br>
(e.g., are non-toxic materials), are capable of withstanding the extrusion<br>
temperatures of the modeling material for a short period of time, and are<br>
capable of withstanding the temperature of the build chamber 12 for<br>
extended periods of time.<br>
Examples of particularly suitable support materials include<br>
solvent-dispersed materials, such as a sucrose solution and a salt<br>
solution. Examples of suitable component concentration for sucrose<br>
solutions include about 73% by weight sucrose (C12H22O11) in water at<br>
about 90°C, and about 80% by weight sucrose in water at about 120°C.<br>
Each of these sucrose solutions exhibits a viscosity of about 18<br>
centipoises. After jetting, the water solvent volatilizes in interior region 24<br>
of the build chamber 16, which leaves the residual sucrose at the jetted<br>
locations to build the support structure 36. Salt solutions, such as a<br>
sodium chloride in water solution function in the same manner as sucrose<br>
solutions, and also exhibit high thermal conductivities (about five<br>
watts/meter-°C). This assists in the uniform cooling of the object 38.<br>
In addition to being environmentally friendly, sucrose<br>
solutions and salt solutions are also soluble in a variety of solvents. This<br>
allows the support structure 36 to be removed by exposure to solvents,<br>
such as water. For example, after the support structure 36 and the object<br>
38 are built, the support structure 36 may be removed by dissolving, at<br>
least a portion of, or all of the support structure 36 in water to expose the<br>
finished object 38. This may be performed with minimal operator<br>
attention and minimal damage to the geometry or strength of the object<br>
38.<br><br>
20<br>
When building the support structure 36 and the object 38, it<br>
is desirable to have low contact angles between the deposited materials.<br>
The low contact angles increase the extent that the modeling material<br>
conforms to the resolution of the support structure 36. However, low<br>
contact angles also increase the bonding of the support materials and the<br>
modeling materials at the interface between the support structure 36 and<br>
the object 38. Physical removal of the support structure 36 may damage<br>
the exterior surface of the object 38. As such, damage to the object 38<br>
may be avoided by dissolving at least a portion of the support structure 36<br>
in a solvent to remove the support structure 36.<br>
The solubility of solvent-dispersed materials, such as<br>
sucrose solutions and salt solutions, also allows the planarizer 28 to<br>
include smooth planarizers. In this embodiment, portions of the jetted<br>
solvent (e.g., water) remain non-volatilized with the sucrose/salt for<br>
periods of time after jetting. The non-volatilized solvent assists the<br>
planarizer 28 in removing the excess material of the support structure 36<br>
in a manner similar to solvent-assisted lapping planarizers, except that<br>
additional solvent is not required.<br>
As discussed above, the present invention allows three-<br>
dimensional objects to be formed from modeling materials that exhibit<br>
good physical properties, and which are deposited in bulk layers at rapid<br>
rates. The three-dimensional objects also exhibit high resolutions<br>
obtained from the jetted support structures, which enhance the aesthetic<br>
qualities of the three-dimensional objects. The present invention provides<br>
a throughput rate for modeling material of at least about 0.5 liters/hour<br>
(about 30 inches3 /hour), with an accuracy of about 51<br>
micrometers/micrometer(about 0.002 inches/inch), and a surface finish of<br>
about 30 micrometers (about 0.001 inches) root-mean-square.<br><br>
21<br>
As generally discussed above, it is necessary to build<br>
support structures (e.g., the support structure 36) when creating three-<br>
dimensional objects (e.g., the object 38) in a layer-wise fashion, to<br>
support portions of the objects under construction. In the discussions of<br>
FIGS. 1-5, the jetted layers of support material are sequentially deposited<br>
to form interior surfaces (e.g., the interior surface 68) with angles up to<br>
about 90 degrees. In these cases, each layer of support material is jetted<br>
into an underlying layer of support material or modeling material.<br>
However, some three-dimensional object geometries<br>
require that support structures have interior surfaces that project at<br>
angles substantially greater than 90 degrees. In these cases, portions of<br>
layers of support material are jetted into areas without underlying support.<br>
In such areas, particularly with interior surfaces having angles greater<br>
than about 30 degrees off vertical, the jetted support material itself<br>
requires additional support. These overhanging regions present a special<br>
case, where modified build approaches may be used to compensate for<br>
the lack of support at the overhanging regions.<br>
FIGS. 6A-6D are schematic representations of a three-<br>
dimensional object 100 and a support structure 102 under construction on<br>
a platform 103. As shown in FIG. 6A, the support structure 102 includes<br>
overhanging regions 104, which each have lateral portions that project<br>
over the object 100 at angles substantially greater than 90 degrees.<br>
These overhanging regions 104 require additional support. Figs. 6B and<br>
6C show the continued building and completion of the part 100 in the<br>
support structure 102. Fig. 6D shows the completed part 100, removed<br>
from the support structure 102.<br>
A number of approaches may be taken to support<br>
overhanging support structure regions, such as those required to build the<br><br>
22<br>
object 100. Examples of suitable approaches include an extruded thin-<br>
road wall approach, an extruded bulk-road wall approach, a chinking<br>
approach, a lost wax approach, a support stilts approach, and a<br>
thermoplastic ploughing approach. These approaches are described<br>
below in FIGS. 7-11 with reference to an increment i of the overhanging<br>
region 104.<br>
FIGS. 7-11 are illustrations depicting the approaches to<br>
taken support the overhanging region 104, and each include the object<br>
100 (with bulk layers 100a-100c) and the overhanging region 104 of the<br>
support structure 102, as shown in Fig. 6A.<br>
FIGS. 7 and 8 depict the extruded thin-road wall approach<br>
to support the overhanging region 104. As shown in FIG. 7, the extruded<br>
thin-road wall approach involves pre-extruding thin layers 106 of modeling<br>
material into the areas under the overhanging region 104 in the increment<br>
i. This forms supporting walls on the bulk layer 100c, which provides<br>
support to the overhanging region 104. The thin layers 106 may be<br>
deposited from a second extrusion tip, which may be carried either by a<br>
separate extrusion head or a second tip on the primary extrusion head<br>
30. Alternatively, the extrusion tip 64 of the primary extrusion head 30<br>
may include a size-adjustable orifice.<br>
In one embodiment, the modeling material may be<br>
deposited in M thin layers 106, where M is an integer greater than or<br>
equal to 2. The thickness of each of the thin layers 106 is about t/M, so<br>
that the thickness of the supporting walls (i.e., the increment i) is about<br>
equal to the thickness t' of the bulk layers 100a-100c. As shown in FIG.<br>
7, four thin layers 106 are extruded (i.e., M=4). When subsequent bulk<br>
layers of modeling material (not shown) are extruded to fill the increment<br><br>
23<br>
i, the thin layers 106 and the bulk layers of modeling material fuse<br>
together to form a unitary object 100.<br>
Applying the thin layers 106 on the bulk layer 100c provides<br>
a good surface finish in these regions where the modeling material is<br>
applied before the adjacent sidewalls of the support structure 102 are<br>
formed. Accordingly, the thin layers 106 are desirably applied in layers<br>
no thicker than about half the thickness of a bulk layers 100a-100c, in<br>
order to increase resolution. To match the surface finish of the rest of the<br>
part, the thicknesses of the thin layers 106 may be about equal to the<br>
thicknesses t of the support material layers.<br>
As shown in FIG. 8, the overhanging region 104 is formed in<br>
an increment / from support structure layers 104a-104h. The modeling<br>
material is extruded in thin layers 106a-106d. The thin layers 106a-106d<br>
form a supporting wall 108, which supports the support structure layers<br>
104a-104h as they are jetted. The bulk layer 100d is deposited adjacent<br>
the supporting wall 108 to fill the increment i. Because four thin layers<br>
106 (i.e., the thin layers 106a-106d) were extruded, the surface resolution<br>
of the object 100 at the increment i shown in FIGS. 7 and 8 will be four<br>
times greater than by extrusion of the bulk layer 104d alone.<br>
The extruded bulk-road wall approach is similar to the<br>
extruded thin-road wall approach, except that bulk layers of modeling<br>
material are pre-extruded into the areas under the overhanging region<br>
104 prior to forming the overhanging region 104. When subsequent bulk<br>
roads of modeling material are extruded to fill the support structure<br>
increment i, the various bulk roads of modeling material fuse together to<br>
form a unitary object 100. In contrast to the extruded thin-road wall<br>
approach, after removing the support structure 102 from the object 100<br>
formed by the extruded bulk-road approach, the pre-extruded areas of the<br><br>
24<br>
object 100 will exhibit rough surface finishes. These rough areas may be<br>
smoothed by a post-processing step, such as machining, ion milling,<br>
solvent lapping, smearing with a hot surface, grinding, abrasion, and<br>
vapor smoothing.<br>
In the extruded thin-road wall approach and the extruded<br>
bulk-road wall approach, caution must be taken to avoid collision of the<br>
planarizer (e.g., the planarizer 20) with the pre-extruded layers (e.g., the<br>
thin layers 106a-106d). Such collision can be avoided by timing the<br>
planarizing of the jetted support material so that support material is<br>
planarized only when it reaches a height along the z-axis that is greater<br>
than that of the pre-extruded layers. Allowing modeling material of the<br>
thin layers 106a-106d to cool sufficiently to support planarizing shear prior<br>
to dispensing overlaying jetted supports will further protect reliability of the<br>
object 100.<br>
In the case of extruded thin layers 106a-106d, collision may<br>
be avoided by interspersing the extrusion of the thin layers 106a-106d<br>
with the jetting of the support structure layers 104a-104h in a systematic<br>
fashion. First, one or more thin layers 106 may be extruded. Then,<br>
support structure layers 104 are jetted up to at least the height of the<br>
extruded thin layers 106. Planarizing is desirably not performed until the<br>
support structure layers 104 reach or exceed the height of the extruded<br>
thin layers 106. This prevents collisions between the planarizer with the<br>
thin layers 106. Additionally, collision between the extrusion tip (e.g., the<br>
extrusion tip 26) and support layers is prevented by planarizing the<br>
support material before extrusion of subsequent thin layers 106.<br>
Deposition of the thin layers 106, the support structure layers 104, and<br>
planarizing is continued until the support structure increment i is<br><br>
25<br>
completed. The bulk layer 100s of modeling material may then be<br>
deposited to fill the support structure increment;i.<br>
Table 1 provides an example of a sequence for depositing<br>
material to support the overhanging region 104 in the support structure<br>
increment /', with reference to FIG. 8.<br>

As shown in Table 1 and FIG. 8, for each bulk layer (e.g.,<br>
the bulk layer 100d), there are four thin layers 106 (i.e., M=A) and eight<br>
support structure layers 114 (i.e., N=8). As such, following the extrusion<br><br>
26<br>
of each thin layer 106, N/M support layers 104 are jetted, where N/M is<br>
two.<br>
FIG. 9 depicts the chinking approach to support the<br>
overhanging region 104. The chinking approach involves jetting layers<br>
110 of a second modeling material into the areas under the overhanging<br>
region 104 to form supporting walls. The second modeling material is<br>
desirably not removable with the support structure 102 (e.g., not water<br>
soluble), and desirably exhibits good adhesion to the extruded modeling<br>
material. Jetting of the second modeling material may be performed<br>
along with jetting of support material to build the corresponding<br>
overhanging region 104. When subsequent bulk layers of modeling<br>
material (not shown) are extruded to fill the support structure increment i,<br>
the extruded modeling material fuses to the jetted second modeling<br>
material, so that the jetted second modeling material forms a portion of<br>
the object 100.<br>
FIG. 10 depicts the lost wax approach to support the<br>
overhanging region 104. The lost wax approach involves jetting layers<br>
112 of an alternative material into the areas under the overhanging region<br>
104 to form supporting walls. The alternative material is desirably<br>
selected for to exhibit good melt properties (e.g., wax). When subsequent<br>
bulk layers of modeling material (not shown) are extruded to fill the<br>
support structure increment i, the heat of the modeling material melts the<br>
alternative material, and displaces it. The lost wax approach and the<br>
chinking approach may each be accomplished with a second jetting head,<br>
with its own material supply.<br>
FIG. 11 depicts the support stilts approach to support the<br>
overhanging region 104. The support stilts approach involves jetting<br>
support material to build stilts 114 as the support structure increment i is<br><br>
27<br>
formed. Modeling material is then extruded to fill the increment i, such<br>
that the stilts 126 become embedded in the part 100. Where the stilts<br>
114 join the region 104, the stilts 114 fan out to provide a contiguous<br>
downward facing sidewall. After removal of the support structure 102 from<br>
the completed object 100, pinholes or some embedded support material<br>
will remain on the upward faces of the object 100.<br>
The thermoplastic ploughing approach involves depositing<br>
bulk roads of modeling material in areas that would be occupied by the<br>
overhanging region 104, so that the modeling material fills its allotted<br>
volume plus some of the volume that should be occupied by the support<br>
structure 102. This can be done simultaneously with filling the support<br>
structure increment i. A hot finger may then displace the modeling<br>
