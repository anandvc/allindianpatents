The present invention relates to a device for gripping a unit load during handling of same, said device comprising an attachment portion for attaching the device to the unit load and a gripping portion for gripping a handling means.<br>
Standardized containers have long been used to great advantage for the transportation of goods. At their corners, these containers have facilities, referred to as container corners or twist blocks, that project beyond the sides of the container therebetween by a certain amount. Said container corners are designed in such a way that standardized holders can engage with and be locked into said container corners.<br>
Goods of large volume (referred to hereinafter as unit loads) cause substantial problems   during   handling   or   transportation   when   they   are   unsuitable   for<br><br>
containerized transport, for example on account of their dimensions and/or weight. Such unit loads can be steel towers or tower segments, for example, which must often be transported as supports for telecommunications facilities or wind turbines. Such sections are usually 11 - 25 metres in length, up to 4 metres in diameter and between 20 - 70 tonnes in weight. These figures may even be exceeded.<br>
In the following, the invention and the problems encountered in the prior art are described with reference to such steel tower segments. However, attention is expressly drawn to the fact that the invention is not confined to such applications and that it essentially relates to any kind of unit load.<br>
As is well known, steel tower sections present a series of handling and transportation tasks, beginning with manufacture and continuing through transportation to the construction site and to erection of the edifice.<br>
Both ends of the mostly circular cylindrical tower segments are usually fitted with flanges with which the separate sections are connected during erection. Said flanges are also used in most cases to attach the handling or transportation means to the section.<br>
Such means are rotary adapters, for example, by means of which the sections horizontally aligned along their longitudinal axis can be turned about their longitudinal axis, in order, for example, to perform paint finishing work at any part of the outer wall. These rotary adapaters are fastened with screws to the flanges.<br>
By this method, for example, feet are screwed onto the flanges to enable the section to be stored with a predetermined clearance from the ground. As soon as the feet are attached and the section has been laid down, the rotary adapters are removed. The feet are positioned in such a way that there is a certain probability that they still fit and do not have to be refitted when the section is later transported by truck.<br>
When the sections are smaller, they can be transported by truck on a low loader.<br><br>
However, a so-called boiler bridge is required in the case of larger sections. Such a boiler bridge comprises a traction unit with a low loader mounted thereto and a rear trailer, said low loader and trailer being connected to each other by spars and the gap between the two being adjustable within certain limits. When a section is transported using the boiler bridge, on the other hand, different feet must be screwed onto the section in order to hold it in a certain position on the spars of the boiler bridge.<br>
As soon as the section reaches the construction site, hoisting brackets are screw-fastened to the flange of the segment that is to be set upright for assembly. As soon as the section has been raised using the hoisting brackets, the feet are removed from the flange, and the section can be fitted into the tower.<br>
If part of the transportation route is by sea, the feet attached to the section can be welded to the deck of the ship. The feet have to be changed again if the section was transported to the port using a boiler bridge. Although welding the feet is both a simple and effective way of securing the section for transportation, it harbours the risk of the section being damaged when the cargo is discharged - especially when the feet are not separated from the deck of the ship, but simply screwed off the flanges of the section instead. What is more, the feet that are then missing or destroyed have to be replaced by new ones in order to transport the section by truck from the port to the construction site.<br>
As an alternative to welding the feet to the deck of the ship, the sections are secured by chains, for example, which are fed either through the holes in the section or around the outside of the section and then made fast. In order to hold the heavy section in a reliable way, the chains are tightly lashed. This can easily lead to deformations in the section, or damage to the coating, for example. If a boiler bridge is ready for use in the destination port, it is necessary to change the feet once again.<br>
Notorious devices are integral elements with two portions, one of which is for fastening the device to the unit load and the other for operation during handling (e.g. hoisting or laying down).<br><br>
In the devices described, the frequent, time-consuming and hence cost-intensive refittings for the various carrying, support and hoisting procedures during handling of the section in the manufacturing process and during transportation are severe disadvantages. Each device is essentially designed for one task only and for one function only.<br>
One transportation variant on land is a so-called transportation cross. The latter comprises a traction unit and a trailer. The linkage between the two vehicles is provided by the item to be transported - i.e. the tower section, for example. Holding devices that can be screwed to the flanges of the section are disposed on the traction unit and on the trailer.<br>
Assembly and disassembly of the section between the traction unit and the trailer takes a disadvantageous 2.5 to 3 hours in each case, during which time the section must be held by a crane. Use of both the crane and the personnel required is therefore blocked for a very long time.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to provide universally deployable handling means for unit loads, in particular for the production, transportation and assembly of such unit loads.<br>
This object is achieved by the invention with a device as set forth in claim 1, with a set of devices as set forth in claim 7, or with a transport vehicle pursuant to claim 21. Preferred embodiments of the invention are described in the subclaims.<br>
According to the invention, a gripping portion of a gripping device for a unit load is embodied in the form of a container corner, that is to say a standard container bracket. Given that such container corners are the standardized interfaces for hoisting and handling containers, and a substantial portion of all military and commercial logistics worldwide is effected with containers, all the relevant and requisite handling and transportation facilities are available wortdwide in order to handle and transport<br><br>
unit loads fitted with such appliances.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, an attachment portion of the gripping device pursuant to the invention has attachment facilities that are designed to match the unit loads to which the device is to be attached. If the unit load has attachment holes in a flange, for example, then the attachment portion may also have attachment facilities, e.g. in the form of through holes with identical spacing to those on the flange. It is therefore possible to attach the device securely to the unit load in a fast and uncomplicated manner.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the gripping device according to the invention has a indentation that is provided with plate-shaped elements. These are preferably arranged at right angles to each other (and preferably vertical to the the plate-shaped base member of the gripping device), such that the indentation is confined on two sides by said plate-shaped elements and is shaped as an indentation. To transport the unit load using a boiler bridge, the unit load can be supported on the spars of the boiler bridge by means of these indentations fitted with plates, in that the indentations conform to the shape of the - otherwise parallel - spars and cradle them. In the case of spars with lying rectangular cross-section, for example, the plates are oriented in such a way that one lies horizontally on one spar and the respective other plates lies across opposite sides of the spar for laterally securing the unit load.<br>
In a preferred configuration of the invention, the gripping portion is spaced at a distance from the attachment facilities, and in the attachment device area at least one additional attachment facility is provided to which additional cross-members, for example, can be attached within the boundaries of the unit load if the grip device according to the invention is accordingly fitted.<br>
Eyes can also be provided on the grip device according to the invention, to which tarpaulins, for example, can be attached in order to cover the unit load.<br>
According to the invention, an adapter for receiving a unit load is also provided, said<br><br>
adapter comprising a support to and/or in which connector elements are disposed that can be connected to the gripping portion of the appliances according to the invention, which take the form of container corners. This makes it possible, in the case of very heavy unit loads, to distribute the weight over a larger surface via a support, in that the support has a level supporting surface, for example.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the adapter has four connector elements that are disposed alongside each other on the support, preferably in the form of a straight beam, and of which at least two have a certain spacing between each other. If the spacing between said connector elements according to the invention is equal to that of a standardized container dimension, said two fixedly spaced connector elements permit the adapter to be attached in standardized holders, such as those found, for example, on container trucks or on the container decks of ships.<br>
The remaining connector elements may be set or even adjusted to a spacing that permit unit loads to be fastened, by means of gripping devices according to the invention, with a different spacing to that between the standardized holders. If the outer connector elements have the standard spacing, the inner connector elements can hold a unit load with gripping devices with a smaller spacing between them than the standard spacing. If the inner connector elements have a standard spacing between them, then the outer connector elements hold the unit load, which is fitted with devices that have a greater spacing between them than the standard spacing.<br>
Alternatively, all connector elements can have predefined spacings between them, such that the adapter matches certain unit loads, or unit loads with certain dimensions, and can be used immediately without adaptation being necessary.<br>
The invention also relates to a transport means with a towing vehicle and a trailer, wherein the towing vehicle and trailer are connected during transportation by the unit load, and the towing vehicle and trailer have devices at the ends facing each other for holding the unit load.<br><br>
The transport means is preferably so configured that the holding devices have certain connector elements, so-called container brackets, at which the unit load can be quickly and easily fastened to the transport means with the gripping devices according to the invention that are attached to the unit load.<br>
The transport means can have fixed, predefined spacings between the container brackets, or the holding devices can be adjustable in their height and/or their width. The container brackets are then attached to the adjustable portions of the holding devices. The holding devices are preferably adjusted by hydraulic means, in particular, such that they can be easily adjusted to the dimensions of the item to be transported. The transport vehicle for a unit load, comprising a towing vehicle and a trailer, preferably has matching connector elements at the ends of said towing vehicle and trailer that face each other. Said matching connecting elements are arranged relative to each other in such a way that the towing vehicle and the trailer can be directly connected to each other. Thus, if the transport vehicle is not loaded with a unit load (and hence there is no unit load to join the towing vehicle and the trailer), the towing vehicle and the trailer are connected by the connector elements according to the invention in such a way that the resultant entity can be driven. In this way, a drivable entity with the shortest possible length can advantageously be formed in accordance with the invention, said entity being easy to manoeuvre like a single vehicle on account of the substantially rigid link between the towing vehicle and the trailer - and not difficult to manoeuvre like the traction unit with the trailer connected by the tow-bar, as in the prior art.<br>
The connector elements can have spars oriented horizontally in the direction of travel, said spars being lying one above the other in order to connect the towing vehicle and the trailer, with preferably level flange surfaces that may, for example, be horizontal. To secure the connection, the connector elements may have bolts that engage with matching holes on the other side with clearance fit. Such connector elements with matching fit are preferred according to the invention, because they can be connected together in a particularly fast manner. Furthermore, an essentially rigid connection between the traction unit and the trailer can then be achieved preferably by means of<br><br>
clamping elements such as simple ratchet tighteners or bracing belts or threaded tension jacks attachable between the towing vehicle and the trailer, for example to lugs, and which can clamp the traction unit and the trailer to each other also in such a way that the interlocking connection in the example is secured against loosening.<br>

Fig. la shows, in a three-dimensional view, a first embodiment of a gripping appliance 10 according to the invention. Device 10 comprises an attachment portion 12 and a gripping portion 14 attached thereto. The attachment portion 12 has holes 20 as attachment facilities with which the gripping devices 10 can be fastened to the unit load 16 (not shown in this figure) in a certain position, preferably by screw connections.<br>
An essential feature here is the spatial orientation, in particular the distance 18 between the attachment facilities 20 and the gripping portion 14, in that this also results, for example, in the spacing between the unit load 16 (not shown in this figure) and a level base, when the unit load is set on the ground with a set of gripping devices 10 as feet.<br>
Because the invention with its advantages is also illustrated here in the description of the figures, for the example of a circular cylindrical section 16 of a steel tower with circular ring-shaped flanges at both ends thereof, the attachment facilities 20 (through holes) adapted to said flanges are arranged in a pattern with curved centre line. When the spacing between the holes is identical, the device (10) according to the invention can be fastened to a flange of the section 16.<br>
According to the invention, the gripping portion 14 is a so-called container corner-Said container corner is fixed to a support plate 15. Due to the fact that no element of<br><br>
the gripping device projects beyond the container corner, the gripping device can serve as a hoisting point for appropriate hoisting means such as container gantries or container spreaders, and as a foot for setting down the unit load.<br>
Owing to the possibility of using standardized fixing means for containers, it is no longer necessary to weld the feet to a ship's deck, for example. One can also dispense with lashing down the unit load with chains as a way of securing it during transportation by ship.<br>
Two plates 24 are attached in a indentation 22 in the attachment portion 12. Said plates are at an angle of a to each other and demarcate the sides of indentation 22. The plates each run vertically to the surface of attachment portion 12. In this way, the devices according to the invention can also be adapted as a set for setting the unit load 16 down on a boiler bridge and for cradling the support spars of the boiler bridge by conforming to their shape.<br>
Figs, lb - e show alternative embodiments of a gripping device 10. Here, the features described with reference to Fig. la are differently proportioned and positioned in relation to each other - e.g. by adapting to a differently dimensioned and/or configured transportation load (not shown). Fig. 1c is the side elevation view of Fig. 1b and Fig. 1e is the side elevation view of Fig. Id, whereby Figs, lb and Id each show a front view.<br>
Fig. 2 shows yet another embodiment of a device according to the invention. One significant difference to the device shown in Figure 1a consists in the fact that indentation 22 is not formed (as was already the case in Figs, lb - c). Furthermore, the portion between the attachment portion and the gripping portion is embodied in a shortened form. This embodiment cannot, therefore, be used as a foot for setting down the unit load on level ground, if, with the same fixing position of the gripping devices and the same diameter of the unit load, the outer contours of the unit load project beyond a conceived connection line between the gripping portions of two gripping devices. However, the device can easily be used as a hoisting point for the<br><br>
unit load if it is attached to an upper edge of the unit load.<br>
Devices 10 shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 each have an additional attachment facility 19 at or in their first portions 12. Said attachment facility is configured here as a through hole, and other fixtures, for example stiffening struts, can be attached hereto (cf. Fig. 4).<br>
Fig. 3 shows an adapter 30 according to the invention, comprising a total of four container corners as outer connector elements 34 and inner connector elements 35 mounted on a support 32. These outer and inner connector elements 34, 35 are in fixed positions on the support 32. The spacing 36 between the two outer container corners 34 is equal to the standard dimension of 2260 mm from centre to centre. The spacing between the two inner connector elements 35 is smaller. This means that unit loads onto which the gripping devices 10 according to the invention are attached with a smaller spacing than the standard 2260 mm due to the unit loads being of smaller dimensions can nevertheless be handled and transported by means of adapter 30 using standardized facilities for container handling and transportation.<br>
Alternatively, in the case of a longer support 32, the inner connector elements 35 can have the standard spacing of 2260 mm and the outer connector elements 34 can then receive unit loads that only permit gripping devices 10 of the invention to be fitted at points beyond this standard dimension.<br>
Fig. 4 shows one application of the devices 10 and an adapter 30 pursuant to the invention. The sections of a steel tower, shown as unit loads 16, are fitted with a set of gripping devices 10 and stacked one above the other. Due to their relatively 'small' diameter, it is not possible to fit devices 10 with a spacing of 2260 mm between the centres of the container corners 14 of devices 10. Devices 10 are attached with a smaller spacing between their centres.<br>
In order to enable the advantageous use of standardized facilities and transport means despite this smaller spacing, an adapter 30 is additionally provided under the lower<br><br>
section. Said adapter is fitted in such a way that the inner connector elements 35 have the same spacing as the devices/appliances 10 attached to the lower section. The outer connector elements 34 have the standard spacing and thus permit the use of existing facilities and transport means.<br>
In order to provide a secure mechanical connection between the container corners 14 of the set of gripping devices 10 attached to the lower section, on the one hand, and the adapter, on the other, and also between the container corners of the lower section and those of the upper section, standardized connector elements (not shown) are used such as those that are also used on conventional containers to connect their container corners directly with each other.<br>
In the lower section, between the additional, diagonally opposite attachment facilities 19 of the separate gripping devices 10, supports are attached that prevent the lower section from being deformed under the load of the upper section.<br>
Fig. 5 shows transport means according to the invention, comprising a towing vehicle 44, a low loader 45 and a trailer 42. Holding devices 40 for holding the unit load 16 during transportation are disposed on the facing ends of the low loader 45 and the trailer 42. A connection is thus formed via the unit load 16 between the low loader 45 and the trailer 42.<br>
For a trip without a transportation load, the low loader 45 and the trailer 42 are connected by a tow-bar 48 that engages with matching couplings on the low loader 45 and the trailer 42 (bottom of Fig. 5).<br>
On the right of Fig, 9, a horizontal support spar of the chassis of an alternative transport means comprising a towing vehicle 102 can be seen, and on the left of Fig. 9 a horizontal support spar of the chassis of an associated trailer 104 can be seen, said support spars ending respectively in holding devices 106, 108 for a unit load (not shown). At their lower end, holding devices 106, 108 have spars that project horizontally towards other and which face each other in the direction of travel. (110, 112) Spars 110, 112 are firstly used (like the container brackets 113 at the upper end<br><br>
of holding devices 106, 108) for attaching to a unit load (not shown) when the towing vehicle 102 and the trailer 104 are loaded with the unit load, and secondly, in the unloaded state as shown, for establishing a direct connection between the towing vehicle 102 and the trailer 104. Spars 110, 112 are each disposed as mutually corresponding connector elements in such a way to the holding devices 106 and 108 that they lie one above the other when directly connected, and are connected with horizontal flange surfaces 114 lying congruently one above the other.<br>
Spars 110, 112, which are congruent in shape and form a cooperating connecting structure, have on the one hand a bolt 116 on flange surface 114 of spar 110, said bolt engaging, in the connected position as shown, with a hole 116 in the flange surface 114 of spar 112. This connection 116 formed by conformity of shape is secured by two tensioning elements 118 that are stretched between eyes 120 on the holding devices 106, 108 in such a way that the towing vehicle 102 and the trailer 104 are rigidly clamped to each other.<br>
In Fig. 6, the holding device 40 in Fig. 5 can be seen more precisely in the form of a vertically disposed base frame that has two vertical stays 2 and two horizontal traverses 4. On either side of the lower traverse 4, extension arms 5 with hydraulic cylinders 8 can be telescopically withdrawn and extended in the direction of traverse 4 (horizontally and laterally thereto). In stay 2 there are stay extensions 3 that can similarly be withdrawn and extended with the aid of hydraulic cylinders 8 in the longitudinal direction of stays 2 (vertically upwards). On stay extensions 3 there is then a crossbeam 6, at the outer ends of which container brackets 7 - standardized facilities for rapid engagement with container corners - are attached. Additional container brackets 7 are located at the ends of the horizontally and laterally extendable extension arms 5. The position of said extension arms can be seen particularly well in Fig. 7.<br>
It is also clearly apparent from Fig. 7 that the outer portions of said extension arms 5 run at a right angle to the respective extension arm 5 in the direction of the respective holding device 40 facing the extension arm on the transport vehicle. The container<br><br>
brackets 7 are disposed on said angled portions of extension arms 5 in such a way, therefore, that operating the lower hydraulic cylinder 8 causes the lower container brackets 7 to be laterally displaced. By this means, the holding device 40 according to the invention can be adjusted to the width and/or to the spacing between the devices 10 and the unit load 16.<br>
The side elevation view in Fig. 8 also shows the holding device 40 on the low loader 45 and the trailer 42. It can easily be seen from this view that operating the upper hydraulic cylinder 8 causes an extension of the stays 3 and hence a change in the height of the upper container brackets 7 disposed on the crossbeam 6.<br>
The crossbeam 6 can also comprise a plurality of laterally adjacent container brackets 7, or may also enable telescopic adjustment in this direction such that, in addition to hydraulic (or pneumatic) adjustment of height, the horizontal lateral position of the upper container brackets can also be adapted to the transportation load.<br><br><br>
