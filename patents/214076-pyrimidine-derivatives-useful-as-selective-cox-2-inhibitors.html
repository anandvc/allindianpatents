				<td>PYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVES USEFUL AS SELECTIVE COX-2 INHIBITORS<br>
This invention relates to pyrimidine derivatives, to processes for their<br>
preparation, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to their use in<br>
medicine.<br>
The enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX) has recently been discovered to exist in two<br>
isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 corresponds to the originally identified<br>
constitutive enzyme while COX-2 is rapidly and readily inducible by a number of<br>
agents including mitogens, endotoxin, hormones, cytokines and growth factors.<br>
Prostaglandins generated by the action of COX have both physiological and<br>
pathological roles. It is generally believed that COX-1 is largely responsible for<br>
the important physiological functions such as maintenance of gastrointestinal<br>
integrity and renal blood flow. In contrast the inducible form, COX-2, is believed<br>
to be largely responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins where<br>
rapid induction of the enzyme occurs in response to such agents as<br>
inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors and cytpkines. A selective<br>
inhibitor of COX-2 would therefore have anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic and<br>
analgesic properties, without the potential side effects associated with inhibition<br>
of COX-1. We have now found a novel group of compounds which are both<br>
potent and selective inhibitors of COX-2.<br>
The invention thus provides the compounds of formula (I)<br>
in which:<br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of H, C1-6alkyl, C1-2alkyl substituted by<br>
one to five fluorine atoms, C3-6alkenyl, C3-6afkynyl, C3-10cycloalkylC0-6alkyl, C4-<br>
12bridged cycloalkyl, A(CR4R5)n and B(CR4R5)n;<br>
R2 is C1-2alkyl substituted by one to five fluorine atoms;<br>
R3 is selected from the group consisting of C1-6alkyl, NH2 and R7CONH;<br>
R4 and R5 are independently selected from H or C1-6alkyl;<br>
A is an unsubstituted 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl or an unsubstituted 6-<br>
membered aryl, or a 5- or 6-membered heteroaryl or a 6-membered aryl<br>
substituted by one or more R6;<br>
R6 is selected from the group consisting of halogen, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkyl<br>
substituted by one more fluorine atoms, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6alkoxy substituted by<br>
one or more F, NH2SO2 and C1-6alkylSO2;<br>
B is selected from the group consisting of<br>
defines the point of attachment of the ring;<br>
R7 is selected from the group consisting of H, C1-6alkyl, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6alkylOC1-<br>
6alkyl, phenyl, HO2CC1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylOCOC1-6alkyl, C1-6alkylOCO, H2NC1-<br>
6alkyl, C1-6alkylOCONHC1-6alkyl and C1-6alkylCONHC1-6alkyl; and<br>
n is 0 to 4.<br>
The term halogen is used to represent fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
The term "alkyl" as a group or part of a group means a straight or branched chain<br>
alkyl group, for example a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl or<br>
t-butyl group.<br>
The term 5-membered heteroaryl means a heteroaryl selected from the<br>
following:<br>
The term 6- membered heteroaryl means a heteroaryl selected from the<br>
following:<br>
The term 6-mernbered aryl means:<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention encompasses all isomers of the<br>
compounds ot formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives,<br>
including all geometric, tautomeric and optical forms, and mixtures thereof (e.g.<br>
racemic mixtures). In particular when the ring B lacks a plane of symmetry the<br>
compounds of formula (I) contain a chiral centre as indicated therein by the<br>
asterisk *. Furthermore, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that when<br>
R4 and R5 in formula (I) are different the corresponding compounds contain at<br>
least one chiral centre, by virtue of the asymmetric carbon atom defined thereby,<br>
and that such compounds exist in the form of a pair of optical isomers (i.e.<br>
enantiomers).<br>

In a more preferred aspect the invention provides the following compound:<br>
2-butoxy-4-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine.<br>
Since the compounds of the present invention, in particular compounds of<br>
formula (I), are intended for use in pharmaceutical compositions, it will be<br>
understood that they are each provided in substantially pure form, for example at<br>
least 50% pure, more suitably at least 75% pure and preferably at least 95%<br>
pure (% are on a wt/wt basis). Impure preparations of the compound of formula<br>
(I) may be used for preparing the more pure forms used in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions. Although the purity of intermediate compounds of the present<br>
invention is less critical, it will be readily understood that the substantially pure<br>
form is preferred as for the compounds of formula (I). Preferably, whenever<br>
possible, the compounds of the present invention are available in crystalline<br>
form.<br>
When some of the compounds of this invention are allowed to crystallise or are<br>
recrysallised from organic solvents, solvent of recrystallisation may be present in<br>
the crystalline product. This invention includes within its scope such solvates.<br>
Similarly, some of the compounds of this invention may be crystallised or<br>
recrystallised from solvents containing water. In such cases water of hydration<br>
may be formed. This invention includes within its scope stoichiometric hydrates<br>
as well as compounds containing variable amounts of water that may be<br>
produced by processes such as lyophilisation. In addition, different<br>
crystallisation conditions may lead to the formation of different polymorphic<br>
forms of crystalline products. This invention includes within its scope all the<br>
polymorphic forms of the compounds of formula (I).<br>
Compounds of the invention are potent and selective inhibitors of COX-2. This<br>
activity is illustrated by their ability to selectively inhibit COX-2 over COX-1.<br>
In view of their selective COX-2 inhibitory activity, the compounds of the present<br>
invention are of interest for use in human and veterinary medicine, particularly in<br>
the treatment of the pain (both chronic and acute), fever and inflammation of a<br>
variety of conditions and diseases mediated by selective inhibition of COX-2.<br>
Such conditions and diseases are well known in the art and include rheumatic<br>
fever; symptoms associated with influenza or other viral infections, such as the<br>
common cold; lower back and neck pain; headache; toothache; sprains and<br>
strains; myositis; sympathetically maintained pain; synovitis; arthritis, Including<br>
rheumatoid arthritis; degenerative joint diseases, including osteoarthritis; gout<br>
and ankylosing spondylitis; tendinitis; bursitis; skin related conditions, such as<br>
psoriasis, eczema, burns and dermatitis; injuries, such as sports injuries and<br>
those arising from surgical and dental procedures.<br>
The compounds of the invention are also useful for the treatment of neuropathic<br>
pain. Neuropathic pain syndromes can develop following neuronal injury and the<br>
resulting pain may persist for months or years, even after the original injury has<br>
healed. Neuronal injury may occur in the peripheral nerves, dorsal roots, spinal<br>
cord or certain regions in the brain. Neuropathic pain syndromes are<br>
traditionally classified according to the disease or event that precipitated them.<br>
Neuropathic pain syndromes include: diabetic neuropathy; sciatica; non-specific<br>
lower back pain; multiple sclerosis pain; fibromyalgia; HIV-related neuropathy;<br>
neuralgia, such as post-herpetic neuralgia and trigeminal neuralgia; and pain<br>
resulting from physical trauma, amputation, cancer, toxins or chronic<br>
inflammatory conditions. These conditions are difficult to treat and although<br>
several drugs are known to have limited efficacy, complete pain control is rarely<br>
achieved. The symptoms of neuropathic pain are incredibly heterogeneous and<br>
are often described as spontaneous shooting and lancinating pain, or ongoing,<br>
burning pain. In addition, there is pain associated with normally non-painful<br>
sensations such as "pins and needles" (paraesthesias and dysesthesias),<br>
increased sensitivity to touch (hyperesthesia), painful sensation following<br>
innocuous stimulation (dynamic, static or thermal allodynia), increased sensitivity<br>
to noxious stimuli (thermal, cold, mechanical hyperalgesia), continuing pain<br>
sensation after removal of the stimulation (hyperpathia) or an absence of or<br>
deficit in selective sensory pathways (hypoalgesia).<br>
The compounds of the invention are also useful for the treatment of other<br>
conditions mediated by selective inhibition of COX-2.<br>
For example, the compounds of the invention inhibit cellular and neoplastic<br>
transformation and metastatic tumour growth and hence are useful in the<br>
treatment of certain cancerous diseases, such as colonic cancer and prostate<br>
cancer. The compounds of the invention are also useful in reducing the number<br>
of adenomatous colorectal polyps and thus reduce the risk of developing colon<br>
cancer. The compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of<br>
cancer associated with overexpression of HER-2/neu, in particular breast<br>
cancer.<br>
Compounds of the invention also prevent neuronal injury by inhibiting the<br>
generation of neuronal free radicals (and hence oxidative stress) and therefore<br>
are of use in the treatment of stroke; epilepsy; and epileptic seizures (including<br>
grand mal, petit mal, myoclonic epilepsy and partial seizures).<br>
Compounds of the invention also inhibit prostanoid-induced smooth muscle<br>
contraction and hence are of use in the treatment of dysmenorrhoea and<br>
premature labour.<br>
Compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of liver disease,<br>
such as inflammatory liver disease, for example chronic viral hepatitis B, chronic<br>
viral hepatitis C, alcoholic liver injury, primary biliary cirrhosis, autoimmune<br>
hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and liver transplant rejection.<br>
Compounds of the invention inhibit inflammatory processes and therefore are of<br>
use in the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis and respiratory distress<br>
syndrome; gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease,<br>
Crohn"s disease, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome and ulcerative colitis; and the<br>
inflammation in such diseases as vascular disease, migraine, periarteritis<br>
nodosa, thyroiditis, aplastic anaemia, Hodgkin"s disease, sclerodoma, type I<br>
diabetes, myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, sorcoidosis, nephrotic syndrome,<br>
Bechet"s syndrome, polymyositis, gingivitis, conjunctivitis and myocardial<br>
ischemia.<br>
Compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of ophthalmic<br>
diseases such as retinitis, retinopathies, uveitis and of acute injury to the eye<br>
tissue.<br>
Compounds of the invention are also useful for the treatment of cognitive<br>
disorders such as dementia, particularly degenerative dementia (including senile<br>
dementia, Alzheimer"s disease, Pick"s disease, Huntington"s chorea, Parkinson"s<br>
disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease), and vascular dementia (including multi-<br>
infarct dementia), as well as dementia associated with intracranial space<br>
occupying lesions, trauma, infections and related conditions (including HIV<br>
infection), metabolism, toxins, anoxia and vitamin deficiency; and mild cognitive<br>
impairment associated with ageing, particularly Age Associated Memory<br>
Impairment.<br>
Compounds of the invention are also useful in the treatment of disorders<br>
ameliorated by a gastroprokinetic agent. Disorders ameliorated by<br>
gastroprokinetic agents include ileus, for example post-operative ileus and ileus<br>
during sepsis; gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD, or its synonym GERD);<br>
gastroparesis, such as diabetic gastroparesis; and other functional bowel<br>
disorders, such as non-ulcerative dyspepsia (NUD) and non-cardiac chest pain<br>
(NCCP).<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, we provide a compound of<br>
formula (I) for use in human or veterinary medicine.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, we provide a compound of<br>
formula (I) for use in the treatment of a condition which is mediated by COX-2.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, we provide a method of treating a<br>
human or animal subject suffering from a condition which is mediated by COX-2<br>
which comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I).<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, we provide a method of treating a<br>
human or animal subject suffering from an inflammatory disorder, which method<br>
comprises administering to said subject an effective amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I).<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, we provide the use of a compound<br>
of formula (I) for the manufacture of a therapeutic agent for the treatment of a<br>
condition which is mediated by COX-2.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, we provide the use of a compound<br>
of formula (I) for the manufacture of a therapeutic agent for the treatment of an<br>
inflammatory disorder.<br>
It is to be understood that reference to treatment includes both treatment of<br>
established symptoms and prophylactic treatment, unless explicitly stated<br>
otherwise.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds of the invention may advantageously<br>
be used in conjunction with one or more other therapeutic agents. Examples of<br>
suitable agents for adjunctive therapy include a 5HT1 agonist, such as a triptan<br>
(e.g. sumatriptan or naratriptan); an adenosine A1 agonist; an EP ligand; an<br>
NMDA modulator, such as a glycine antagonist; a sodium channel blocker (e.g.<br>
lamotrigine); a substance P antagonist (e.g. an NK1 antagonist); a cannabinoid;<br>
acetaminophen or phenacetin; a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; a leukotriene receptor<br>
antagonist; a DMARD (e.g. methotrexate); gabapentin and related compounds; a<br>
tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. amitryptilline); a neurone stabilising antiepileptic<br>
drug; a mono-aminergic uptake inhibitor (e.g. venlafaxine); a matrix<br>
metalloproteinase inhibitor; a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor, such as an<br>
iNOS or an nNOS inhibitor; an inhibitor of the release, or action, of tumour<br>
necrosis factor a; an antibody therapy, such as a monoclonal antibody therapy;<br>
an antiviral agent, such as a nucleoside inhibitor (e.g. lamivudine) or an immune<br>
system modulator (e.g. interferon); an opioid analgesic; a local anaesthetic; a<br>
stimulant, including caffeine; an H2-antagonist (e.g. ranitidine); a proton pump<br>
inhibitor (e.g. omeprazole); an antacid (e.g. aluminium or magnesium hydroxide;<br>
an antiflatulent (e.g. simethicone); a decongestant (e.g. phenylephrine,<br>
phenylpropanolamine, pseudoephedrine, oxymetazoline, epinephrine,<br>
naphazoline, xylometazoline, propylhexedrine, or levo-desoxyephedrine); an<br>
antitussive (e.g. codeine, hydrocodone, carmiphen, carbetapentane, or<br>
dextramethorphan); a diuretic; or a sedating or non-sedating antihistamine. It is<br>
to be understood that the present invention covers the use of a compound of<br>
formula (I) in combination with one or more other therapeutic agents.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are conveniently administered in the form of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions. Thus, in another aspect of the invention, we<br>
provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I)<br>
adapted for use in human or veterinary medicine. Such compositions may<br>
conveniently be presented for use in conventional manner in admixture with one<br>
or more physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) may be formulated for administration in any<br>
suitable manner. They may, for example, be formulated for topical<br>
administration or administration by inhalation or, more preferably, for oral,<br>
transdermal or parenteral administration. The pharmaceutical composition may<br>
be in a form such that it can effect controlled release of the compounds of<br>
formula (I).<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may take the form of, for<br>
example, tablets (including sub-lingual tablets), capsules, powders, solutions,<br>
syrups or suspensions prepared by conventional means with acceptable<br>
excipients.<br>
For transdermal administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be given in<br>
the form of a transdermal patch, such as a transdermal iontophoretic patch.<br>
For parenteral administration, the pharmaceutical composition may be given as<br>
an injection or a continuous infusion (e.g. intravenously, intravascularly or<br>
subcutaneously). The compositions may take such forms as suspensions,<br>
solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles and may contain formulatory<br>
agents such as suspending, stabilising and/or dispersing agents. For<br>
administration by injection these may take the form of a unit dose presentation or<br>
as a multidose presentation preferably with an added preservative.<br>
Alternatively for parenteral administration the active ingredient may be in powder<br>
form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated as a depot preparation.<br>
Such long acting formulations may be administered by implantation (for example<br>
subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for<br>
example, the compounds of the invention may be formulated with suitable<br>
polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an<br>
acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for<br>
example, as a sparingly soluble salt.<br>
As stated above, the compounds of the invention may also be used in<br>
combination with other therapeutic agents. The invention thus provides, in a<br>
further aspect, a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) together with<br>
a further therapeutic agent.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in<br>
the form of a pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations<br>
comprising a combination as defined above together with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier or excipient comprise a further aspect of the invention. The<br>
individual components of such combinations may be administered either<br>
sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical<br>
formulations.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is used in combination with a second<br>
therapeutic agent active against the same disease state the dose of each<br>
compound may differ from that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate<br>
doses will be readily appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
A proposed daily dosage of a compound of formula (I) for the treatment of man<br>
is 0.01mg/kg to 500mg/kg, such as 0.05mg/kg to 100mg/kg, e.g. 0.1mg/kg to<br>
50mg/kg, which may be conveniently administered in 1 to 4 doses. The precise<br>
dose employed will depend on the age and condition of the patient and on the<br>
route of administration. Thus, for example, a daily dose of 0.25mg/kg to<br>
10mg/kg may be suitable for systemic administration.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by any method known in the art for<br>
the preparation of compounds of analogous structure.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a process which comprises:<br>
reacting an alcohol R1OH of formula (II) or a protected derivative thereof with a<br>
compound of formula (III)<br>
and thereafter and if necessary,<br>
interconverting a compound of formula (I) into another compound of formula (I);<br>
and/or<br>
deprotecting a protected derivative of compound of formula (I).<br>
The overall synthesis of a compound of formula (I) is shown in Scheme 1 below<br>
in which, R1 and R2 are as defined in formula (I) above unless otherwise stated,<br>
R3 is C1-6alkyl; THF is tetrahydrofuran; MTBE is methyl t-butyl ether; and alkyl is<br>
a straight or branched chain alkyl group, for example a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, i-<br>
propyl, n-butyl, s-butyl or t-butyl group.<br>
Referring to Scheme 1, the preparation of compounds of formula (I) may<br>
conveniently be achieved by the treatment of compounds of formula (III) with an<br>
alcohol of formula (II) in the presence of sodium hydride. The reaction is<br>
conveniently carried out in a solvent such as THF and at between ambient<br>
temperature and reflux.<br>
Conveniently the oxidation shown in Scheme 1 is effected using a<br>
monopersulfate compound, such as potassium peroxymonosulfate (known as<br>
Oxone™) and the reaction is carried out in a solvent, such as an aqueous<br>
alcohol, (e.g. aqueous methanol), and at between -78°C and ambient<br>
temperature.<br>
Alternatively, the oxidation shown in Scheme 1 may be effected using hydrogen<br>
peroxide in the presence of catalytic sodium tungstate dihydrate. The reaction<br>
may be carried out in a solvent such as acetic acid and at between ambient<br>
temperature and reflux (e.g. 50°C).<br>
Referring to Scheme 1, the cyclisation of diones of formula (VI) to give the<br>
corresponding pyrimidines of formula (IV) is conveniently carried out employing<br>
a thioronium salt such as a 2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea sulfate and under reflux.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that certain of the procedures<br>
described in Scheme 1 for the preparation of compounds of formula (I) or<br>
intermediates thereto may not be applicable to some of the possible<br>
substituents.<br>
It will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art that it may be necessary<br>
or desirable to carry out the transformations described in Scheme 1 in a different<br>
order from that described, or to modify one or more of the transformations, to<br>
provide the desired compound of formula (I).<br>
In one variation of Scheme 1, compounds of formula (III) wherein R3 is C1-6alkyl<br>
or NH2 may be prepared by oxidising a compound of formula (IV)A;<br>
under oxidation conditions described hereinabove. Compounds of formula (1V)A<br>
may be prepared according to the general procedures of Scheme 1 by<br>
employing sulphonyl derivatives in place of the corresponding sulfide<br>
compounds of formulae (VI) and (VII).<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that compounds of formula (I)<br>
may be prepared by interconversion, utilising other compounds of formula (I) as<br>
precursors. Suitable interconversions, such as alkylations, are well known to<br>
those skilled in the art and are described in many standard organic chemistry<br>
texts, such as "Advanced Organic Chemistry" by Jerry March, fourth edition<br>
(Wiley, 1992), incorporated herein by reference. For example, compounds of<br>
formula (I) wherein R1 is C1-6alkyl, C1-2alkyl substituted by one to five fluorine<br>
atoms, C3-6alkenyl, C3-6alkynyl, C3-10cycloalkylC0-6alkyl, C4-12bridged cycloalkane,<br>
A(CR4R5)n (with the proviso that n is not zero) and B(CR4R5)n may be prepared<br>
by alkylating the corresponding compound of formula (I) wherein R1 is H.<br>
Acylation of compounds of formula (I) wherein R3 is NH2, to provide compounds<br>
of formula (I) wherein R3 is R7CONH, may be carried out by conventional means,<br>
for example by employing conventional acylating agents such as those<br>
described in "Advanced Organic Chemistry", pp 417-424, incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art it may be necessary or desirable<br>
at any stage in the synthesis of compounds of formula (I) to protect one or more<br>
sensitive groups in the molecule so as to prevent undesirable side reactions.<br>
The protecting groups used in the preparation of compounds of formula (I) may<br>
be used in conventional manner. See, for example, those described in<br>
"Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by Theodora W Green and Peter G M<br>
Wuts, second edition, (John Wiley and Sons, 1991), incorporated herein by<br>
reference, which also describes methods for the removal of such groups.<br>
Alcohols of formula (II) are either known compounds or may be prepared by<br>
literature methods, such as those described in "Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations: a guide to functional group preparations" by Richard Larock<br>
(VCH, 1989), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Thioronium salts of formula (V) are either known compounds or may be<br>
prepared by literature methods, such as those described in A H Owens et al,<br>
Eur J Med Chem, 1988, 23(3), 295-300, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Acetophenones of formula (VII) are either known compounds or may be<br>
prepared by conventional chemistry.<br>
Certain intermediates described above are novel compounds, and it is to be<br>
understood that all novel intermediates herein form further aspects of the<br>
present invention. Compounds of formulae (III) and (IV) are key intermediates<br>
and represent a particular aspect of the present invention.<br>
Solvates (e.g. hydrates) of a compound of the invention may be formed during<br>
the work-up procedure of one of the aforementioned process steps.<br>

2-Butoxy-4-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine<br>
Sodium methoxide (6.6kg of a 30%w/w solution in methanol) was added over at<br>
least 30min to a solution of 4-(methylthio)acetophenone (5.0kg) and methyl<br>
trifluoroacetate (4.25kg) in tert-butylmethylether (40L) at 40±3°C. The solution<br>
was heated at 40±3°C for at least 3h. Acetic acid (55L) was added, followed by<br>
S-methyl 2-thiopseudourea sulfate (5.45kg) and the mixture concentrated to ca.<br>
45L. The mixture was heated at about 110°C for at least a further 8h (overnight)<br>
then acetic acid (20L) was added before cooling to 50±3°C. A solution of<br>
sodium tungstate dihydrate (0.2kg) in water (2.5L) was added, followed by<br>
hydrogen peroxide (20.7kg of 30%w/v solution), which was added over at least<br>
3h, maintaining the temp at ca. 50°. The mixture is heated at ca. 50°C for at<br>
least 12h before cooling to 20±3°C. A solution of sodium sulphite (3.45kg) in<br>
water (28L) was then added over at least 30min whilst maintaining the<br>

A suspension of 2-(methylsulfonyl)-4-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine (525g) in n-butanol (5.25L) was treated with<br>
potassium carbonate (210g) at 20±5°C. The mixture was heated to 50±5°C<br>
overnight until the reaction was complete by HPLC. Acetic acid (1.57L) was<br>
added dropwise, to control any gas evolution, keeping the temperature at<br>
50±5°C. Water (3.67L) was then added over 30min keeping the temperature at<br>
50±5°C to allow full crystallisation to occur. The slurry was then cooled to 20-<br>
25°C and aged for at least 1 hour. The resulting product was then filtered under<br>
vacuum and washed with a mixture of n-butanol (787mL), acetic acid (236mL),<br>
and water (551 mL) followed by water (2x1.57L). The product was then dried at<br>

Biological Data<br>
Celt Based Assay<br>
Inhibitory activity against human COX-1 and COX-2 was assessed in COS cells<br>
which had been stably transfected with cDNA for human COX-1 and human<br>
COX-2. 24 Hours prior to experiment, COS cells were transferred from the<br>
175cm2 flasks in which they were grown, onto 24-well cell culture plates using<br>
the following procedure. The incubation medium (Dulbecco"s modified eagles<br>
medium (DMEM) supplemented with heat-inactivated foetal calf serum (10%v/v),<br>
penicillin (100 lU/ml), streptomycin (100µg/ml) and geneticin (600µg/ml)) was<br>
removed from a flask of confluent cells (1 flask at confluency contains<br>
approximately 1x107 cells). 5ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was added<br>
to the flask to wash the cells. Having discarded the PBS, cells were then<br>
incubated with 5ml trypsin for 5 minutes in an incubator (37°). The flask was<br>
then removed from the incubator and 5ml of fresh incubation medium was<br>
added. The contents of the flask was transferred to a 250ml sterile container<br>
and the volume of incubation medium subsequently made up to 100ml. 1ml cell<br>
suspension was pipetted into each well of 4x24-well cell culture plates. The<br>
plates were then placed in an incubator (37°C, 95% air/5% CO2) overnight. If<br>
more than 1 flask of cells were required, the cells from the individual flasks were<br>
combined before being dispensed into the 24-well plates.<br>
Following the overnight incubation, the incubation medium was completely<br>
removed from the 24-well cell culture plates and replaced with 250ml fresh<br>
DMEM (37°C). The test compounds were made up to 250x the required test<br>
concentration in DMSO and were added to the wells in a volume of 1µl. Plates<br>
were then mixed gently by swirling and then placed in an incubator for 1 hour<br>
(37°C, 95% air/5% CO2). Following the incubation period, 10µl of arachidonic<br>
acid (75µM) was added to each well to give a final arachidonic acid<br>
concentration of 30µM. Plates were then incubated for a further 10 minutes,<br>
after which the incubation medium was removed from each well of the plates<br>
and stored at -20°C, prior to determination of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels<br>
using enzyme immunoassay. The inhibitory potency of the test compound was<br>
expressed as an IC50 value, which is defined as the concentration of the<br>
compound required to inhibit the PGE2 release from the cells by 50%. The<br>
selectivity ratio of inhibition of COX-1 versus COX-2 was calculated by<br>
comparing respective IC50 values.<br>
The following IC50 values for inhibition of COX-2 and COX-1 were obtained from<br>
the cell based assay for compounds of the invention:<br>
Microsomal Assay<br>
Inhibitory activity against microsomal h-COX2 was assessed against a<br>
microsomal preparation from baculovirus infected SF9 ceils. An aliquot of<br>
microsomal preparation was thawed slowly on ice and a 1/40,000 dilution<br>
prepared from it into the assay buffer (sterile water, degassed with argon<br>
containing 100mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10mM EDTA (pH7.4), 1mM phenol, 1mM<br>
reduced glutathione, 20mg/ml gelatin and 0.001mM Hematin). Once diluted the<br>
enzyme solution was then sonicated for 5 seconds (Branson sonicator, setting 4,<br>
1cm tip) to ensure a homogeneous suspension. 155µl enzyme solution was<br>
then added to each well of a 96-welI microtitre plate containing either 5µl test<br>
compound (40x required test concentration) or 5µl DMSO for controls. Plates<br>
were then mixed and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. Following the<br>
incubation period, 40µl of 0.5µM arachidonic acid was added to each well to give<br>
a final concentration of 0.1µM. Plates were then mixed and incubated for<br>
exactly 10 minutes (room temperature) prior to addition of 25µl 1M HCI<br>
(hydrochloric acid) to each well to stop the reaction. 25µl of 1M NaOH (sodium<br>
hydroxide) was then added to each well to neutralise the solution prior to<br>
determination of PGE2 levels by enzyme immunoassay (EIA).<br>
The following IC50 values for inhibition of COX-2 and COX-1 were obtained from<br>
the microsomal assay for compounds of the invention:<br>
