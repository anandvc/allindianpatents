This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application no. 60/926,661, filed April 27, 2007, U.S. provisional application no. 60/930,036, filed May 11, 2007, U.S. provisional application no. 60/937,003, filed June 21, 2007, and U.S. provisional application no. 60/962,409, filed July 27, 2007, the disclosure of each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to compounds of formula I, and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, compositions comprising an effective amount of a compound of formula I and methods for treating or preventing a condition such as pain, UI, an ulcer, IBD, and IBS, comprising administering to an animal in need thereof an effective amount of a compound of formula I.<br>
2.	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Pain is the most common symptom for which patients seek medical advice and treatment. Pain can be acute or chronic. While acute pain is usually self-limited, chronic pain persists for 3 months or longer and can lead to significant changes in a patient’s personality, lifestyle, functional ability and overall quality of life (K.M. Foley, Pain, in Cecil Textbook of Medicine 100-107 (J.C. Bennett and F. Plum eds., 20th ed. 1996)).<br>
Moreover, chronic pain can be classified as either nociceptive or neuropathic. Nociceptive pain includes tissue injury-induced pain and inflammatory pain such as that associated with arthritis. Neuropathic pain is caused by damage to the peripheral or central nervous system and is maintained by aberrant somatosensory processing. There is a large body of evidence relating activity at vanilloid receptors (V. Di Marzo et al, Current Opinion in Neurobiology 12:372-379 (2002)) to pain processing.<br>
Nociceptive pain has been traditionally managed by administering non-opioid analgesics, such as acetylsalicylic acid, choline magnesium trisalicylate, acetaminophen,<br>
ibuprofen, fenoprofen, diflusinal, and naproxen; or opioid analgesics, including morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, levorphanol, fentanyl, oxycodone, and oxymorphone. Id. In addition to the above-listed treatments, neuropathic pain, which can be difficult to treat, has also been treated with anti-epileptics (e.g., gabapentin, carbamazepine, valproic acid, topiramate, phenytoin), NMDA antagonists (e.g., ketamine, dextromethorphan), topical lidocaine (for post-herpetic neuralgia), and tricyclic antidepressants (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline and amitriptyline).<br>
UI is uncontrollable urination, generally caused by bladder-detrusor-muscle instability. UI affects people of all ages and levels of physical health, both in health care settings and in the community at large. Physiologic bladder contraction results in large part from acetylcholine-induced stimulation of post-ganglionic muscarinic-receptor sites on bladder smooth muscle. Treatments for UI include the administration of drugs having bladder-relaxant properties, which help to control bladder-detrusor-muscle overactivity.<br>
None of the existing commercial drug treatments for UI has achieved complete success in all classes of UI patients, nor has treatment occurred without significant adverse side effects.<br>
Treatment of ulcers typically involves reducing or inhibiting the aggressive factors. For example, antacids such as aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, sodium bicarbonate, and calcium bicarbonate can be used to neutralize stomach acids. Antacids, however, can cause alkalosis, leading to nausea, headache, and weakness. Antacids can also interfere with the absorption of other drugs into the blood stream and cause diarrhea.<br>
H2 antagonists, such as cimetidine, ranitidine, famotidine, and nizatidine, are also used to treat ulcers. H2 antagonists promote ulcer healing by reducing gastric acid and digestive-enzyme secretion elicited by histamine and other H2 agonists in the stomach and duodenum. H2 antagonists, however, can cause breast enlargement and impotence in men, mental changes (especially in the elderly), headache, dizziness, nausea, myalgia, diarrhea, rash, and fever.<br>
H*, K+ - ATPase inhibitors such as omeprazole and lansoprazole are also used to treat ulcers, H*, K+ - ATPase inhibitors inhibit the production of enzymes used by the stomach to secrete acid. Side effects associated with H*, K+ - ATPase inhibitors include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal colic, headache, dizziness, somnolence, skin rashes, and transient elevations of plasma activities of aminotransferases.<br>
Inflammatory-bowel disease (“IBD”) is a chronic disorder in which the bowel becomes inflamed, often causing recurring abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The two types of IBD are Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis.<br>
Crohn’s disease, which can include regional enteritis, granulomatous ileitis, and ileocolitis, is a chronic inflammation of the intestinal wall. Crohn’s disease occurs equally in both sexes and is more common in Jews of eastern-European ancestry. Most cases of Crohn’s disease begin before age 30 and the majority start between the ages of 14 and 24. The disease typically affects the full thickness of the intestinal wall. Generally the disease affects the lowest portion of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine, but can occur in any part of the digestive tract.<br>
Cramps and diarrhea, side effects associated with Crohn’s disease, can be relieved by anticholinergic drugs, diphenoxylate, loperamide, deodorized opium tincture, or codeine.<br>
When Crohn’s disease causes the intestine to be obstructed or when abscesses or fistulas do not heal, surgery can be necessary to remove diseased sections of the intestine. Surgery, however, does not cure the disease, and inflammation tends to recur where the intestine is rejoined. In almost half of the cases a second operation is needed. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 528-530 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>
Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease in which the large intestine becomes inflamed and ulcerated, leading to episodes of bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and fever. Ulcerative colitis usually begins between ages 15 and 30; however, a small group of people have their first attack between ages 50 and 70. Unlike Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis never affects the small intestine and does not affect the full thickness of the intestine. The disease usually begins in the rectum and the sigmoid colon and eventually spreads partially or completely throughout the large intestine. The cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown.<br>
Treatment of ulcerative colitis is directed to controlling inflammation, reducing symptoms, and replacing lost fluids and nutrients. Anticholinergic drugs and low doses of diphenoxylate or loperamide are administered for treating mild diarrhea. For more intense diarrhea higher doses of diphenoxylate or loperamide, or deodorized opium tincture or codeine are administered.<br>
Irritable-bowel syndrome (“IBS”) is a disorder of motility of the entire gastrointestinal tract, causing abdominal pain, constipation, and/or diarrhea. IBS affects three-times more women than men. In IBS, stimuli such as stress, diet, drugs,<br>
hormones, or irritants can cause the gastrointestinal tract to contract abnormally. During an episode of IBS, contractions of the gastrointestinal tract become stronger and more frequent, resulting in the rapid transit of food and feces through the small intestine, often leading to diarrhea. Cramps result from the strong contractions of the large intestine and increased sensitivity of pain receptors in the large intestine.<br>
Treatment of IBS typically involves modification of an IBS-patient’s diet. Often it is recommended that an IBS patient avoid beans, cabbage, sorbitol, and fructose. A low-fat, high-fiber diet can also help some IBS patients. Regular physical activity can also help keep the gastrointestinal tract functioning properly. Drugs such as propantheline that slow the function of the gastrointestinal tract are generally not effective for treating IBS. Antidiarrheal drugs, such as diphenoxylate and loperamide, help with diarrhea. The Merck Manual of Medical Information 525-526 (R. Berkow ed., 1997).<br>

4.	BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES<br>
Fig 1. 96-well plate with different agonist solutions (Agonist Plate). Seven different sulfuric acid solutions, or agonist solutions, with different sulfuric acid (H2SO4) concentrations (of from 15.0 mM to 18 mM as indicated) were used for the pH assay as indicated. For the wells in row A, measuring buffer alone was used. The final<br>
concentration of sulfuric acid in the wells for each row, after a 1:4 dilution of the agonist solution, is also indicated in each row in parenthesis.<br>
Fig 2. pH dependent Ca2+responses in TRPV1/CHO cells. Ca2+influx into TRPV1/CHO cells as measured by Fura-2 AM fluorescence is indicated by the graph within each rectangular field. The graph presents the fluorescence intensity over time starting from the addition of agonist solution. Each rectangular field presents one experiment performed in one well of a 96-well plate. Each row presents six experiments performed at the same final sulfuric acid concentration; the final sulfuric acid concentration is indicated at the left. Actual pH values were measured after the experiment and are indicated above the graph. No antagonists were added to the cell culture. Final sulfuric acid concentrations of 3.2 and 3.3 mM produced an appropriate Ca2+ response and were selected for subsequent assays. These final sulfuric acid concentrations can be obtained by 1:4 dilutions of agonist solution with sulfuric acid concentrations of 16.0 mM or 16.5 mM, respectively (see Fig. 1).<br>
Fig 3. (A) A 96-well plate with two different sulfuric acid concentrations. Wells in columns 1 to 6 had one final sulfuric acid concentration; wells in columns 7 to 12 had a different final sulfuric acid concentration. The final sulfuric acid concentration was reached by 1:4 dilution of two different agonist solutions with sulfuric acid concentrations of X mM and (X + 0.5) mM, respectively. In the experiment described in Section 2 of Protocol 2, X was determined to be 16 mM. (B) A 96-well plate with different test compound, or antagonist, concentrations indicated in nM. Only one kind of test compound was applied per 96-well plate. Since two different sulfuric acid concentrations were used (columns 1-6 vs. columns 7-12), seven wells were tested for each combination of test compound concentration and agonist solution (e.g., wells Al, Bl, C1, El, Fl, Gl, and HI were tested for test compound concentration 0.977 nM and agonist solution with sulfuric acid solution X mM). The wells in row D did not include an antagonist in order to measure the maximal Ca2+ response.<br>

Aqueous solubility of compounds is often a desirable feature. For example, aqueous solubility of a compound permits that compound to be more easily formulated into a vAr1ety of dosage forms that may be administered to an animal. When a compound is not fully soluble in the blood, it may precipitate in the blood, and the animal’s exposure to the drug will accordingly not correspond to the administered dose. Aqueous solubility increases the likelihood that a compound will not precipitate in an animal’s blood, and increases the ability to predict exposure at the taR8et sight of the compound.<br>
Compounds of formula I are highly soluble in aqueous solution. For example, at either pH 6.8 or pH 1.2, compound 200 isinsoluble in aqueous solution, i.e., has an aqueous solubility 50 and &gt;50, respectively. Additionally, the aqueous solubility at either pH 6.8 or pH 1.2 of each of compounds of formula IG6, H6, J2, and Zl is &gt;50 uM. The following compounds are aqueous insoluble at pH 6.8: 203,207,200, and 208. The following compounds have very low aqueous solubility at pH 6.8: 209,210,211,212, 213,214, and 215 have aqueous solubility, in uM, of 1.0, 0.4, 0.4, 1.9, 0.8, 1.8, and 0.6,<br>
respectively. The aqueous solubility, in uM, at pH 1.2 of compounds 209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214 and 215 is 9.3, 2.0,1.3,10.3, 39.6, &gt;50 and 9.6, respectively. In contrast, the aqueous solubility at pH 6.8, in uM, of compounds of formula I Nl, Fl, C1, Y3, and U3 is 28.0, 22.6,15.7, 17.4, and 26.4, respectively .At pH 1.2, compounds of formula I Nl, Fl, C1, Y3 and U3 all have an aqueous solubility of &gt;50 uM. The aqueous solubility, at either pH 6.8 or pH 1.2, is &gt;50 uM for each of the following compounds of formula I: HI, N6, Zl, SI, E2, and Ul.<br>
5.2      COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA II<br>
Preferred compounds of formula I are compounds of formula II:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, where the dashed line, W, X, An, Ar2, R3, R4, R20, and m are as defined above for compounds of formula I, wherein Q is<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
Z, is -OH, -SH, -N(R20)2, -CH2-OH, -CH2-SH, or -CH2-N(R20)2; Z2 is -H, -CH3, or -CH2-OR7; each Z3 is independently -H or -CH3; and J is -OH, -SH, or -N(R20)2.<br>
In addition to being highly soluble in aqueous solution, compounds of formula II are preferred because side effects are less severe (e.g., attenuation or removal of central<br>
nervous system side effects) in animals administered a compound of formula II. For example, muscle relaxation is attenuated or absent in animals administered a compound of formula n. Sedation is attenuated or absent in animals administered a compound of formula n. Ataxia is attenuated or absent in animals administered a compound of formula n. Flat body posture is attenuated or absent in animals administered a compound of formula n. Tremor is attenuated or absent in animals administered a compound of formula n. When a compound induces less severe side effects, the therapeutic index, which is the difference between an effective dose and a dose that causes adverse effects, is increased. Therapeutic index is a measure of the safety of a compound when administered to an animal. The greater the therapeutic index, the safer the compound.<br>
Compounds of formula II also have excellent pharmacokinetic properties. Specifically, the plasma level of a compound of formula II in an animal is dose proportionate. Therefore, the amount of compound in the plasma of an animal can be more readily controlled according to the dose of the compound administered to the animal. Moreover, for a given dose administered, the animal plasma concentration is greater and is achieved more rapidly for a compound of formula n. For example, compound 200 achieves its maximum plasma concentration 3.1 h after administration. In contrast, compound of formula II Zl achieves its maximum plasma concentration 2.5 h after administration and that maximum plasma concentration is 2.5 times greater than the maximum for compound 200. Additionally, compound of formula IIR6 achieves its maximum plasma concentration 1.85 h after administration and that maximum plasma concentration is 5.3 times greater than the maximum for compound 200. For each of compounds of formula II Zl and R6, the plasma concentration up to 24 h is consistently greater for each when compared with compound 200.<br>
Compound R6 has the following structure:<br>
(STRUCTURE REMOVED)<br>
Compounds of formula II are also preferred because they have a high therapeutic index. Therapeutic index is the difference between the amount of a compound that is effective for treating a Condition and the amount of that same compound that induces adverse effects.<br>

In one embodiment, a compound of formula II is a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative of a compound of formula n.<br>

One skilled in the art will recognize that, e.g., acid addition salts of a compound of formula I can be prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate acid via a vAr1ety of known methods.<br>
Compounds of formula I encompass all solvates of compounds of formula I. “Solvates” are known in the art and are considered to be a combination, physical association and/or solvation of a compound of formula I with a solvent molecule, e.g., a disolvate, monosolvate or hemisolvate when the ratio of the solvent molecule to the molecule of the compound of formula I is 2:1, 1:1 or 1:2, respectively. This physical association involves varying degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydrogen<br>
bonding. In certain instances, the solvate can be isolated, for example when one or more solvent molecules are incorporated into the crystal lattice of a crystalline solid. Thus, “solvate,” as used herein, encompasses both solution-phase and isolatable solvates. A compound of formula I of the invention may be present as a solvated form with a pharmaceutically acceptable solvent, such as water, methanol, ethanol, and the like, and it is intended that the invention include both solvated and unsolvated compound of formula I forms. As “hydrate” relates to a particular subgroup of solvates, i.e., where the solvent molecule is water, hydrates are included within the solvates of the invention. Preparation of solvates is known in the art. For example, M. Caira et al, J. Pharmaceut. Set, 93(3):601-611 (2004), describes the preparation of solvates of fluconazole with ethyl acetate and with water. Similar preparations of solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates, and the like are described by E.C. van Tonder et al, AAPS Pharm. Sci. Tech., 5(1), article 12 (2004), and A.L. Bingham et al, Chem. Commun., 603-604 (2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving the compound of formula I in a desired amount of the desired solvent (oR8anic, water or mixtures thereof) at temperatures above about 20°C to about 25°C, cooling the solution at a rate sufficient to form crystals, and isolating the crystals by known methods, e.g., filtration. Analytical techniques, for example, infrared spectroscopy, can be used to show the presence of the solvent in a crystal of the solvate.<br>
The invention disclosed herein is also meant to encompass all prodrugs of the compounds of the invention. “Prodrugs” are known in the art and, while not necessAr1ly possessing any pharmaceutical activity as such, are considered to be any covalently bonded carrier(s) that releases the active parent drug in vivo. In general, such prodrugs will be a functional derivative of a compound of formula I, II and/or EH which is readily convertible in vivo, e.g., by being metabolized, into the required compound of formula I, II and/or HI. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described in, for example, Design of Prodrugs, H. Bundgaard ed., Elsevier (1985); “Drug and Enzyme TaR8eting, Part A,” K. Widder et al. eds., Vol. 112 in Methods in Enzymology, Academic Press (1985); Bundgaard, “Design and Application of Prodrugs,” Chapter 5 (pp. 113-191) in A Textbook of Drug Design and Development, P. Krogsgaard-Larsen and H. Bundgaard eds., Harwood Academic Publishers (1991); Bundgaard et al, Adv. Drug Delivery Revs. 8:1-38 (1992); Bundgaard et al, J. Pharmaceut. Sci. 77:285 (1988); and Kakeya et al, Chem. Pharm Bull. 32:692 (1984).<br>
In addition, one or more hydrogen, carbon or other atoms of a compound of formula I can be replaced by an isotope of the hydrogen, carbon or other atoms. Compounds of formula I include all radiolabeled forms of compounds of formula I. Such a “radiolabeled,” “radiolabeled form”, and the like of a compound of formula I, each of which is encompassed by the invention, is useful as a research and/or diagnostic tool in metabolism pharmacokinetic studies and in binding assays. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into a compound of formula I of the invention include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous, sulfur, fluorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 180,170,31P, 32P, 35S, 18F, and 36C1, respectively. Radiolabeled compounds of the invention can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, tritiated compounds of formula I can be prepared by introducing tritium into the particular compound of Formula I, for example, by catalytic dehalogenation with tritium. This method may include reacting a suitably halogen-substituted precursor of a compound of Formula I with tritium gas in the presence of a suitable catalyst, for example, Pd/C, in the presence or absence of a base. Other suitable methods for prepAr1ng tritiated compounds can be found in Filer, Isotopes in the Physical and Biomedical Sciences, Vol. 1, Labeled Compounds (Part A), Chapter 6 (1987). 14C-labeled compounds can be prepared by employing starting materials having a 14C carbon.<br>
A compound of formula I can contain one or more asymmetric centers and may thus give rise to enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms. Compounds of formula I encompass all such possible forms as well as their racemic and resolved forms or any mixture thereof. When a compound of formula I contains an olefinic double bond or other center of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended to include all “geometric isomers,” e.g., both E and Z geometric isomers. All “tautomers,” e.g., ketone-enol, amide-imidic acid, lactam-lactim, enamine-imine, amine-imine, and enamine-enimine tautomers, are intended to be encompassed by the invention as well.<br>

Moreover, the same technique can be used when Arr is another pyridyl ring, pyrimidinyl, pyraZ1nyl or pyridaZ1nyl.<br>

At the completion of the reaction, the mixture is concentrated under reduced pressure to about 500 mL, diluted with 2L of water, and extracted three times with ethyl acetate (1L for each extraction). The oR8anic portions are combined, dried (Na2S4), and concentrated under reduced pressure under mild<br>
heating to provide a residue. The residue is added to 500 mL of methylene chloride and applied to the top of column packed with 2 kg silica eluted with a 0% to 10% gradient of ethyl acetate in hexane to provide 24.<br>
Vinyl groups are highly versatile, because they are a synthetic handle that can be further modified. It is well known in synthetic oR8anic chemistry that olefin hydrolysis yields a benzylic hydroxyl group, hydroboration gives a primary hydroxyl group, ozonolysis gives an aldehyde or ketone, oxidation gives a carboxylic acid, olefin metathesis extends the chain, and dihydroxylation gives a 1,2-diol. Many additional olefin functionalization techniques are available to those skilled in oR8anic synthesis. Once functionalized, the group can undeR8o further transformations. Exemplified in scheme 1.14 is the vinyl group of 21 undeR8oing an asymmetric dihydroxylation.<br>

5.7	THERAPEUTIC/PROPHYLACTIC ADMINISTRATION AND COMPOSITIONS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Due to their activity, compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, are advantageously useful in veterinary and human medicine. As described above, compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, are useful for treating or preventing a Condition.<br>
When administered to an animal, compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, are typically administered as a component of a composition that comprises a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. The present compositions, which comprise a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can be administered orally. Compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can also be administered by any other convenient route, for example, by infusion or bolus injection, by absorption through epithelial or mucocutaneous linings {e.g., oral, rectal, and intestinal mucosa, etc.) and can be administered together with another therapeutically active agent. Administration can be systemic or local. VaR10us delivery systems are known, e.g., encapsulation in liposomes, microparticles, microcapsules, capsules, etc., and can be used to administer the compound of fonnula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.<br>
Methods of administration include, but are not limited to, intradermal, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intravenous, subcutaneous, intranasal, epidural, oral, sublingual, intracerebral, intravaginal, transdermal, rectal, by inhalation, or topical, particularly to the ears, nose, eyes, or skin. The mode of administration is left to the discretion of the practitioner. In most instances, administration will result in the release of compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, into the bloodstream.<br>
In specific embodiments, it can be desirable to administer the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, locally. This can be achieved, for example, and not by way of limitation, by local infusion during suR8ery, topical application, e.g., in conjunction with a wound dressing Ar2er suR8ery, by injection, by means of a catheter, by means of a suppository or enema, or by means of an implant, said implant being of a porous, non-porous, or gelatinous material, including membranes, such as sialastic membranes, or fibers.<br>
In certain embodiments, it can be desirable to introduce the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, into the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract by any suitable route, including intraventricular, intrathecal, and epidural injection, and enema. Intraventricular injection can be facilitated by an intraventricular catheter, for example, attached to a reservoir, such as an Ommaya reservoir.<br>
Pulmonary administration can also be employed, e.g., by use of an inhaler or nebulizer, and formulation with an aerosoliZ1ng agent, or via perfusion in a fluorocarbon or synthetic pulmonary surfactant. In certain embodiments, the compounds of formula I can be formulated as a suppository, with traditional binders and excipients such as triglycerides.<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can be delivered in a vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (199O) and Treat et al, Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer 317-327 and 353-365 (1989)).<br>
In yet another embodiment, the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can be delivered in a controlled-release system or sustained-release system (see, e.g., Goodson, in Medical Applications of Controlled Release, supra, vol. 2, pp. 115-138 (1984)). Other controlled- or sustained-release systems discussed in the review by Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (199O) can be used. In one embodiment, a pump can be used (Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (199O); Sefton, CRC Crit. Ref. Biomed. Eng. 14:201 (1987); Buchwald et al, SuR8ery 88:507 (198O); and Saudek et al, N. Engl. J. Med. 321:574 (1989)). In another embodiment, polymeric materials can be used (see Medical Applications of Controlled Release (Langer and Wise eds., 1974); Controlled Drug Bioavailability, Drug Product Design and Performance (Smolen and Ball eds., 1984); Ranger and Peppas, J. Macromol. Sci. Rev. Macromol. Chem. 23:61 (1983); Levy et al, Science 228:190 (1985); During et al,<br>
Ann. Neurol. 25:351 (1989); and Howard et al, J. NeurosuR8. 71:105 (1989)). In yet another embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release system can be placed in proximity of a taR8et of the compounds of formula I, e.g., the spinal column, brain, or gastrointestinal tract, thus requiring only a fraction of the systemic dose.<br>
The present compositions can optionally comprise a suitable amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient so as to provide the form for proper administration to the animal.<br>
Such pharmaceutical excipients can be liquids, such as water and oils, including those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, such as peanut oil, soybean oil, mineral oil, sesame oil and the like. The pharmaceutical excipients can be saline, gum acacia, gelatin, starch paste, talc, keratin, colloidal silica, urea and the like. In addition, auxiliary, stabiliZ1ng, thickening, lubricating, and coloring agents can be used. In one embodiment, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are sterile when administered to an animal. Water is a particularly useful excipient when the compound of formula I is administered intravenously. Saline solutions and aqueous dextrose and glycerol solutions can also be employed as liquid excipients, particularly for injectable solutions. Suitable pharmaceutical excipients also include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose, gelatin, malt, R1ce, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate, talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol and the like. The present compositions, if desired, can also contain minor amounts of wetting or emulsifying agents, or can contain pH buffering agents.<br>
The present compositions can take the form of solutions, suspensions, emulsion, tablets, pills, pellets, multiparticulates, capsules, capsules containing liquids, powders, multiparticulates, sustained-release formulations, suppositories, emulsions, aerosols, sprays, suspensions, or any other form suitable for use. In one embodiment, the composition is in the form of a capsule (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,698,155). Other examples of suitable pharmaceutical excipients are described in Remington’s Pharmaceutical Sciences 1447-1676 (Alfonso R. Gennaro ed., 19th ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In one embodiment, the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, are formulated in accordance with routine procedures as a composition adapted for oral administration to human beings. Compositions for oral delivery can be in the form of tablets, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, granules, powders, emulsions, capsules, syrups, or elixirs, for example. Orally administered<br>
compositions can contain one or more agents, for example, sweetening agents such as fructose, aspartame or sacchAr1n; flavoring agents such as peppermint, oil of winteR8reen, or cherry; coloring agents; and preserving agents, to provide a pharmaceutically palatable preparation. Moreover, where in tablet or pill form, the compositions can be coated to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract thereby providing a sustained action over an extended peR10d of time. Selectively permeable membranes surrounding an osmotically active driving compound are also suitable for orally administered compositions. In these latter platforms, fluid from the environment surrounding the capsule is imbibed by the driving compound, which swells to displace the agent or agent composition through an aperture. These delivery platforms can provide an essentially zero order delivery profile as opposed to the spiked profiles of immediate release formulations. A time-delay material such as glycerol monostearate or glycerol stearate can also be used. Oral compositions can include standard excipients such as mannitol, lactose, starch, magnesium stearate, sodium sacchAr1n, cellulose, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, the excipients are of pharmaceutical grade.<br>
The compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can be administered by controlled-release or sustained-release means or by delivery devices that are known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Examples include, but are not limited to, those described in U.S. Patent Nos.: 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 4,008,719; 5,674,533; 5,059,595; 5,591,767; 5,120,548; 5,073,543; 5,639,476; 5,354,556; and 5,733,566, each of which is incorporated herein by reference. Such dosage forms can be used to provide controlled- or sustained-release of one or more active ingredients using, for example, hydropropylmethyl cellulose, ethylcellulose, other polymer matrices, gels, permeable membranes, osmotic systems, multilayer coatings, microparticles, liposomes, microspheres, or a combination thereof to provide the desired release profile in varying proportions. Suitable controlled- or sustained-release formulations known to those of ordinary skill in the art, including those described herein, can be readily selected for use with the active ingredients of the invention. The invention thus encompasses single unit dosage forms suitable for oral administration such as, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, gelcaps, and caplets that are adapted for controlled- or sustained-release.<br>
Controlled- or sustained-release pharmaceutical compositions can have a common goal of improving drug therapy over that achieved by their non-controlled or<br>
non-sustained release counterparts. In one embodiment, a controlled- or sustained-release composition comprises a minimal amount of a compound of formula I to cure or control the condition in a minimum amount of time. Advantages of controlled- or sustained-release compositions include extended activity of the drug, reduced dosage frequency, and increased patient compliance. In addition, controlled- or sustained-release compositions can favorably affect the time of onset of action or other characteristics, such as blood levels of the compound of formula I, and can thus reduce the occurrence of adverse side effects.<br>
Controlled- or sustained-release compositions can be designed to immediately release an amount of a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, that promptly produces the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect, and gradually and continually release other amounts of the compound of formula I to maintain this level of therapeutic or prophylactic effect over an extended peR10d of time. To maintain a constant level of the compound of formula I in the body, the compound of formula I can be released from the dosage form at a rate that will replace the amount of compound of formula I being metabolized and excreted from the body. Controlled- or sustained-release of an active ingredient can be stimulated by vaR10us conditions, including but not limited to, changes in pH, changes in temperature, concentration or availability of enzymes, concentration or availability of water, or other physiological conditions or compounds.<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, can be formulated for intravenous administration. Typically, compositions for intravenous administration comprise sterile isotonic aqueous buffer. Where necessary, the compositions can also include a solubiliZ1ng agent. Compositions for intravenous administration can optionally include a local anaesthetic such as lignocaine to lessen pain at the site of the injection. Generally, the ingredients are supplied either separately or mixed together in unit dosage form, for example, as a dry lyophilized powder or water free concentrate in a hermetically sealed container such as an ampoule or sachette indicating the quantity of active agent. Where the compounds of formula I are to be administered by infusion, they can be dispensed, for example, with an infusion bottle containing sterile pharmaceutical grade water or saline. Where the compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, are administered by injection, an ampoule of sterile water for injection or saline can be provided so that the ingredients can be mixed pR10r to administration.<br>
The amount of the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, that is effective in the treatment or prevention of a Condition can be determined by standard clinical techniques. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays can optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage ranges. The precise dose to be employed will also depend on the route of administration, and the seR10usness of the Condition and can be decided according to the judgment of a practitioner and/or each animal’s circumstances. Suitable effective dosage amounts, however, will typically range from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 2500 mg/kg of body weight, although they are typically about 100 mg/kg of body weight or less. In one embodiment, the effective dosage amount ranges from about 0.01 mg/kg of body weight to about 100 mg/kg of body weight of a compound of formula I; in another embodiment, about 0.02 mg/kg of body weight to about 50 mg/kg of body weight; and in another embodiment, about 0.025 mg/kg of body weight to about 20 mg/kg of body weight.<br>
In one embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 24 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 12 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 8 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 6 h until the Condition is abated. In another embodiment, an effective dosage amount is administered about every 4h until the Condition is abated.<br>
The effective dosage amounts described herein refer to total amounts administered; that is, if more than one compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, is administered, the effective dosage amounts correspond to the total amount administered.<br>
Where a cell capable of expressing TRPV1 is contacted with a compound of formula I in vitro, the amount effective for inhibiting the TRPV1 receptor function in a cell will typically range from about 0.01 ug/L to about 5 mg/L; in one embodiment, from about 0.01 ug/L to about 2.5 mg/L; in another embodiment, from about 0.01 ug/L to about 0.5 mg/L; and in another embodiment, from about 0.01 ug/L to about 0.25 mg/L, of a solution or suspension of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. In one embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension comprising the compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, is from about 0.01 uL to about lmL. In another embodiment, the volume of solution or suspension is about 200 uL.<br>
The compounds of formula I, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable derivative thereof, can be assayed in vitro or in vivo for the desired therapeutic or prophylactic activity pR10r to use in humans. Animal model systems can be used to demonstrate safety and efficacy.<br>
The present methods for treating or preventing a Condition in an animal in need thereof can further comprise administering to the animal being administered a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, another therapeutic agent. In one embodiment, the other therapeutic agent is administered in an effective amount.<br>
The present methods for inhibiting TRPV1 function in a cell capable of expressing TRPV1 can further comprise contacting the cell with an effective amount of another therapeutic agent.<br>
Effective amounts of the other therapeutic agents are known in the art. However, it is within the skilled artisan’s purview to determine the other therapeutic agent’s optimal effective-amount range. In one embodiment of the invention, where another therapeutic agent is administered to an animal, the effective amount of the compound of formula I is less than its effective amount would be where the other therapeutic agent is not administered. In this case, without being bound by theory, it is believed that the compounds of formula I and the other therapeutic agent act syneR8istically to treat or prevent a Condition.<br>
The other therapeutic agent can be, but is not limited to, an opioid agonist, a non-opioid analgesic, a non-steroid anti-inflammatory agent, an antimigraine agent, a Cox-II inhibitor, an antiemetic, a P-adreneR8ic blocker, an anticonvulsant, an antidepressant, a Ca2+-channel blocker, an anticancer agent, an agent for treating or preventing UI, an agent for treating or preventing an ulcer, an agent for treating or preventing IBD, an agent for treating or preventing IBS, an agent for treating addictive disorder, an agent for treating Parkinson’s disease and parkinsonism, an agent for treating anxiety, an agent for treating epilepsy, an agent for treating a stroke, an agent for treating a seizure, an agent for treating a pruritic condition, an agent for treating psychosis, an agent for treating Huntington’s chorea, an agent for treating ALS, an agent for treating a cognitive disorder, an agent for treating a migraine, an agent for treating vomiting, an agent for treating dyskinesia, or an agent for treating depression, and mixtures thereof.<br>

6.2	EXAMPLE 11: IN VIVO ASSAYS FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF PAIN<br>
Test Animals: Each experiment uses rats weighing between 200-260 g at the start of the experiment. The rats are group-housed and have free access to food and water at all times, except pR10r to oral administration of a compound of formula I when food is removed for 16 hours before dosing. A control group acts as a compAr1son to rats treated with a compound of formula I. The control group is administered the carrier for the compound of formula I. The volume of carrier administered to the control group is the same as the volume of carrier and compound of formula I administered to the test group.<br>
Acute Pain: To assess the actions of the compounds of formula I on the treatment or prevention of acute pain the rat tail flick test can be used. Rats are gently restrained by hand and the tail exposed to a focused beam of radiant heat at a point 5 cm from the tip using a tail flick unit (Model 7360, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy). Tail flick latencies are as defined as the interval between the onset of the thermal stimulus and the flick of the tail. Animals not responding within 20 seconds are removed from the tail flick unit and assigned a withdrawal latency of 20 seconds. Tail flick latencies are measured immediately before (pre-treatment) and 1,3, and 5 hours following administration of a compound of formula I. Data are expressed as tail flick latency(s) and the percentage of the maximal possible effect (% MPE), i.e., 20 seconds, is calculated as follows:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
The rat tail flick test is described in F.E. D’Amour et al, “A Method for Determining Loss of Pain Sensation,” J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther. 72:74-79 (1941).<br>
Acute pain can also be assessed by measuring the animal’s response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the paw withdrawal threshold (“PWT”), as described below.<br>
Inflammatory Pain: To assess the actions of the compounds of formula I on the treatment or prevention of inflammatory pain the Freund’s complete adjuvant (“FCA”) model of inflammatory pain is used. FCA-induced inflammation of the rat hind paw is associated with the development of persistent inflammatory mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia and provides reliable prediction of the anti-hyperalgesic action of clinically useful analgesic drugs (L. Bartho et al, “Involvement of Capsaicin-sensitive Neurones in Hyperalgesia and Enhanced Opioid Antinociception in Inflammation,” Naunyn-SchmiedebeR8’s Archives of Pharmacol 342:666-670 (199O)). The left hind paw of each animal is administered a 50 uL intraplantar injection of 50% FCA. 24 hour post injection, the animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining the PWT, or to noxious thermal stimuli by determining the PWL, as described below. Rats are then administered a single injection of 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg/Kg of either a compound of formula I; 30 mg/Kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. Responses to noxious mechanical or thermal stimuli are then determined 1, 3,5 and 24 hours post administration. Percentage reversal of hyperalgesia for each animal is defined as:<br>

Assessments of the actions of the compounds of formula IE that were tested revealed these compounds were surprisingly efficaC10us, e.g., compounds of formula III significantly reduced FCA-induced thermal hyperalgesia, with ED50 values of from about 0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg and maximum % reversal values of from about 50% to about 100%. For example, for compound D2 the ED50 value for reversal of thermal hyperalgesia was 0.95 mg/kg at 3 hours Ar2er administration and 1.63 mg/kg at 5 hours<br>
Ar2er administration of D2. Additionally, the maximum % reversal of thermal hyperalgesia was 78.7% at 5 hours Ar2er administration of D2.<br>
Neuropathic Pain: To assess the actions of the compounds of formula I for the treatment or prevention of neuropathic pain either the Seltzer model or the Chung model can be used.<br>
In the Seltzer model, the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce neuropathic hyperalgesia in rats (Z. Seltzer et al, “A Novel Behavioral Model of Neuropathic Pain Disorders Produced in Rats by Partial Sciatic Nerve Injury,” Pain 43:205-218 (199O)). Partial ligation of the left sciatic nerve is performed under isoflurane/02 inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of anaesthesia, the left thigh of the rat is shaved and the sciatic nerve exposed at high thigh level through a small incision and is carefully cleared of surrounding connective tissues at a site near the trocanther just distal to the point at which the posteR10r biceps semitendinosus nerve branches off of the common sciatic nerve. A 7-0 silk suture is inserted into the nerve with a 3/8 curved, reversed-cutting mini-needle and tightly ligated so that the dorsal 1/3 to Vi of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The wound is closed with a single muscle suture (4-0 nylon (Vicryl)) and vetbond tissue glue. Following suR8ery, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder. Sham-treated rats undeR8o an identical suR8ical procedure except that the sciatic nerve is not manipulated. Following suR8ery, animals are weighed and placed on a warm pad until they recover from anaesthesia. Animals are then returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animal is assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, pR10r to suR8ery (baseline), then immediately pR10r to and 1,3, and 5 hours Ar2er drug administration for rear paw of the animal. Percentage reversal of neuropathic hyperalgesia is defined as:<br>
(FORMULA REMOVED)<br>
In the Chung model, the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain is used to produce mechanical hyperalgesia, thermal hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in rats. SuR8ery is performed under isoflurane/02 inhalation anaesthesia. Following induction of<br>
anaesthesia a 3 cm incision is made and the left paraspinal muscles are separated from the spinous process at the L4 - S2 levels. The U transverse process is carefully removed with a pair of small rongeurs to identify visually the L4 - L6 spinal nerves. The left L5 (or L5 and Le) spinal nerve(s) is isolated and tightly ligated with silk thread. A complete hemostasis is confirmed and the wound is sutured using non-absorbable sutures, such as nylon sutures or stainless steel staples. Sham-treated rats undeR8o an identical suR8ical procedure except that the spinal nerve(s) is not manipulated. Following suR8ery animals are weighed, administered a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of saline or ringers lactate, the wound area is dusted with antibiotic powder and they are kept on a warm pad until they recover from the anaesthesia. Animals are then be returned to their home cages until behavioral testing begins. The animals are assessed for response to noxious mechanical stimuli by determining PWT, as described below, pR10r to suR8ery (baseline), then immediately pR10r to and 1, 3, and 5 hours Ar2er being administered a compound of formula I for the left rear paw of the animal. The animal can also be assessed for response to noxious thermal stimuli or for tactile allodynia, as described below. The Chung model for neuropathic pain is described in S.H. Kim, “An Experimental Model for Peripheral Neuropathy Produced by Segmental Spinal Nerve Ligation in the Rat,” /tan 5O(3):355-363 (1992).<br>
Response to Mechanical Stimuli as an Assessment of Mechanical Hyperalgesia: The paw pressure assay can be used to assess mechanical hyperalgesia. For this assay, hind paw withdrawal thresholds (PWT) to a noxious mechanical stimulus are determined using an analgesymeter (Model 7200, commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) as described in C. Stein, “Unilateral Inflammation of the Hindpaw in Rats as a Model of Prolonged Noxious Stimulation: Alterations in Behavior and Nociceptive Thresholds,” Pharmacol. Biochem. and Behavior 3J.:451-455 (1988). The maximum weight that can be applied to the hind paw is set at 250 g and the end point is taken as complete withdrawal of the paw. PWT is determined once for each rat at each time point and only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested.<br>
Response to Thermal Stimuli as an Assessment of Thermal Hyperalgesia: The<br>
plantar test can be used to assess thermal hyperalgesia. For this test, hind paw withdrawal latencies (PWL) to a noxious thermal stimulus are determined using a plantar test apparatus (commercially available from Ugo Basile of Italy) following the<br>
technique described by K. HaR8reaves et ah, “A New and Sensitive Method for Measuring Thermal Nociception in Cutaneous Hyperalgesia,” Pain 32(l):77-88 (1988). The maximum exposure time is set at 32 seconds to avoid tissue damage and any directed paw withdrawal from the heat source is taken as the end point. Three latencies are determined at each time point and averaged. Only the affected (ipsilateral) paw is tested.<br>
Assessment of Tactile Allodvnia: To assess tactile allodynia, rats are placed in clear, Plexiglas compartments with a wire mesh floor and allowed to habituate for a peR10d of at least 15 minutes. Ar2er habituation, a series of von Frey monofilaments are presented to the plantar surface of the left (operated) foot of each rat. The series of von Frey monofilaments consists of six monofilaments of increasing diameter, with the smallest diameter fiber presented first. Five trials are conducted with each filament with each trial separated by approximately 2 minutes. Each presentation lasts for a peR10d of 4-8 seconds or until a nociceptive withdrawal behavior is observed. Flinching, paw withdrawal or licking of the paw are considered nociceptive behavioral responses.<br>
Capsaicin-induced Eye Wipe Test: To assess the effect of compounds of formula I on TRPVl receptor-mediated pain, the capsaicin-induced eye wipe test is used (N.R. Gavva et al., “AMG 9810 [(£)-3-(4-f-Butylphenyl)-iV-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[fe][l,4]dioxin-6-yl)acrylamide], a Novel Vanilloid Receptor 1 (TRPVl) Antagonist with Antihyperalgesic Properties”, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 313:474-484 (2005)). The eye wipe test is a reliable high-throughput test of the effect of TRPVl antagonists. Rats are given a single injection of 1, 3,10 or 30 mg/kg of either a compound of formula I; 30 mg/kg of a control selected from Celebrex, indomethacin or naproxen; or carrier. At 1, 3 or 5 hours Ar2er drug administration, 3 /iL of a 100 uM capsaicin solution (in 10% EtOH/PBS) is instilled in one eye of each animal with a pipette. The number of forelimb movements (touching or wiping of the capsaicin-treated eye) are counted during a 2 minute peR10d following instillation of capsaicin into the eye.<br>
Assessments of the actions of the compounds of formula III revealed these compounds were surprisingly efficaC10us, e.g., compounds of formula III dose-dependently reduced the number of capsaicin-induced eye wipes by from about 25% to about 100% Ar2er their administration relative to the pre-administration eye wipe value.<br>
For example, for compound Nl the number of eye wipes decreased to 1 to 3 Ar2er the administration of Nl relative to the pre-administration eye wipe value of 24. Specifically, the eye wipe value was 3 at 1 hour Ar2er the administration of Nl (87.5% decrease), 1 at 3 hours Ar2er the administration (96% decrease), and 2 at 5 hours Ar2er the administration of Nl (92% decrease).<br>
6.3      EXAMPLE 12; BINDING OF COMPOUNDS OF FORMULA I TO TRPV1<br>
Methods for assaying compounds capable of inhibiting TRPV1 are known in the art, for example, those methods disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,239,267 to Duckworth et al; U.S. Patent No. 6,406,908 to Mc Intyre et al; or U.S. Patent No. 6,335,180 to Julius et al. The results of these assays will demonstrate that compounds of formula I bind to and modulate the activity of TRPV1.<br>
PROTOCOL 1<br>
Human TRPV1 Clonine:<br>
Human spinal cord RNA (commercially available from Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) is used. Reverse transcription is conducted on 1.0 ug total RNA using Thermoscript Reverse Transcriptase (commercially available from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and oligo dT primers as detailed in its product description. Reverse transcription reactions are incubated at 55°C for 1 h, heat-inactivated at 85°C for 5 min, and RNase H-treated at 37°C for 20 min.<br>
Human TRPV1 cDNA sequence is obtained by compAr1son of the human genomic sequence, pR10r to annotation, to the published rat sequence. Intron sequences are removed and flanking exonic sequences are joined to generate the hypothetical human cDNA. Primers flanking the coding region of human TRPV1 are designed as follows: forward primer, GAAGATCTTCGCTGGTTGCACACTGGGCCACA (SEQ ID No: 1); and reverse primer, GAAGATCTTCGGGGACAGTGACGGTTGGATGT (SEQ ID No: 2).<br>
Using these primers, PCR of TRPV1 is performed on one tenth of the Reverse transcription reaction mixture using Expand Long Template Polymerase and Expand Buffer 2 in a final volume of 50 fiL according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Roche<br>
Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Ar2er denaturation at 94°C for 2 min PCR amplification is performed for 25 cycles at 94°C for 15 sec, 58°C for 30 sec, and 68°C for 3 min followed by a final incubation at 72°C for 7 min to complete the amplification. The PCR product of about 2.8 kb is gel-isolated using a 1.0% agarose, Tris-Acetate gel containing 1.6 ug/mL of crystal violet and purified with a S.N.A.P. UV-Free Gel Purification Kit (commercially available from Invitrogen). The TRPV1 PCR product is cloned into the pIND/V5-His-TOPO vector (commercially available from Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to result in the TRPVl-pIND construct. DNA preparations, restriction enzyme digestions, and preliminary DNA sequencing are performed according to standard protocols. Full-length sequencing confirms the identity of the human TRPV1.<br>
Generation of Inducible Cell Lines:<br>
Unless noted otherwise, cell culture reagents are purchased from Life Technologies of Rockville, MD. HEK293-EcR cells expressing the ecdysone receptor (commercially available from Invitrogen) are cultured in Growth Medium (Dulbecco’s Modified Eagles Medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (commercially available from HYCLONE, Logan, UT), lx penicillin/streptomycin, lx glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 400 ug/mL Zeocin (commercially available from Invitrogen)). The TRPVl-pIND constructs are transfected into the HEK293-EcR cell line using Fugene transfection reagent (commercially available from Roche Applied Sciences, Basel, Switzerland). Ar2er 48 h, cells are transferred to Selection Medium (Growth Medium containing 300 ug/mL G418 (commercially available from Invitrogen)). Approximately 3 weeks later individual Zeocin/G418 resistant colonies are isolated and expanded. To identify functional clones, multiple colonies are plated into 96-well plates and expression is induced for 48 h using Selection Medium supplemented with 5 uM ponasterone A (“PonA”) (commercially available from Invitrogen). On the day of assay, cells are loaded with Fluo-4 (a calcium-sensitive dye that is commercially available from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and CAP-mediated calcium influx is measured using a Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (“FLIPR”) as described below. Functional clones are re-assayed, expanded, and cryopreserved.<br>
pH-Based Assay:<br>
Two days pR10r to performing this assay, cells are seeded on poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well clear-bottom black plates (commercially available from Becton-Dickinson) at 75,000 cells/well in growth media containing 5 uM PonA (commercially available from Invitrogen) to induce expression of TRPV1. On the day of the assay, the plates are washed with 0.2 mL lx Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (commercially available from Life Technologies) containing 1.6 mM CaCb and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (“wash buffer”), and loaded using 0.1 mL of wash buffer containing Fluo-4 (3 uM final concentration, commercially available from Molecular Probes). Ar2er 1 h, the cells are washed twice with 0.2 mL wash buffer and resuspended in 0.05 mL lx Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (commercially available from Life Technologies) containing 3.5 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM Citrate, pH 7.4 (“assay buffer”). Plates are then transferred to a FLIPR for assay. The test compound is diluted in assay buffer, and 50 uL of the resultant solution is added to the cell plates and the solution is monitored for two minutes. The final concentration of the test compound is adjusted to range from about 50 picoM to about 3 uM. Agonist buffer (wash buffer titrated with IN HC1 to provide a solution having a pH of 5.5 when mixed 1:1 with assay buffer) (0.1 mL) is then added to each well, and the plates are incubated for 1 additional minute. Data are collected over the entire time course and analyzed using Excel and Graph Pad Prism to determine the IC50.<br>
Capsaicin-Based Assay:<br>
Two days pR10r to performing this assay, cells are seeded in poly-D-lysine-coated 96-well clear-bottom black plates (50,000 cells/well) in growth media containing 5 uM PonA (commercially available from Invitrogen) to induce expression of TRPV1. On the day of the assay, the plates are washed with 0.2 mL lx Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (commercially available from Life Technologies) containing 1 mM CaCb and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and cells are loaded using 0.1 mL of wash buffer containing Fluo-4 (3 uM final). Ar2er one hour, the cells are washed twice with 0.2 mL of wash buffer and resuspended in 0.1 mL of wash buffer. The plates are transferred to a FLIPR for assay. 50 [iL of test compound diluted with assay buffer (lx Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution containing 1 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) are added to the cell plates and incubated for 2 min. The final concentration of the compound is adjusted to range from about 50 picoM to about 3 uM. Human TRPV1 is activated by the addition of 50 fiL of<br>
capsaicin (400 nM), and the plates are incubated for an additional 3 min. Data is collected over the entire time course and analyzed using Excel and GraphPad Prism to determine the IC50.<br>
PROTOCOL 2<br>
For Protocol 2, a Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line (CHO) that has been engineered to constitutively express human recombinant TRPV1 was used (TRPV1/CHO cells). The TRPV1/CHO cell line was generated as described below.<br>
Human TRPV1 Cloning:<br>
A cDNA for the human TRPV1 receptor (hTRPVl) was amplified by PCR (KOD-Plus DNA polymerase, T0Y0B0, Japan) from a human brain cDNA library (BioChain) using primers designed surrounding the complete hTRPVl open reading frame (forward 5’-GGATCCAGCAAGGATGAAGAAATGG (SEQ ID NO:3), and reverse 5’-TGTCTGCGTGACGTCCTCACTTCT (SEQ ID NO:4)). The resulting PCR products were purified from agarose gels using Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare Bioscience) and were subcloned into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen). The cloned cDNA was fully sequenced using a fluorescent dye-terminator reagent (BigDye Terminator ver3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems) and ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems). The pCR-Blunt vector containing the hTRPVl cDNA was subjected to restriction digestion with EcoRl. The restriction fragment was subcloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1(-) (Invitrogen) and named pcDNA3.1(-)-hVRl plasmid. The sequence of the cDNA encoding TRPV1 is available at GenBank accession number AJ277028.<br>
Generation of the TRPV1/CHO Cell Line:<br>
CHO-K1 cells were maintained in growth medium consisting of cc-MEM, 10% FBS (Hyclone), and 100 IU/mL of penicillin - 100 ug/mL of streptomycin mixed solution (Nacalai Tesque, Japan) at 37°C in an environment of humidified 95% air and 5% C02. The cells were transfected with the pcDNA3.1(-)-hVRl plasmid using FuGENE6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. 24 hr Ar2er transfection, neomycin-resistant cells were selected using 1 mg/mL G418 (Nacalai Tesque). Ar2er 2 weeks, individual colonies were picked, expanded, and screened for the expression of<br>
hTRPVl in the capsaicin-induced Ca + influx assay (see below) with a FLIPR (Molecular Devices). A clone with the laR8est Ca2+ response to capsaicin was selected and re-cloned by the same procedure. The cells expressing hTRPVl were cultured in the growth medium supplemented with 1 mg/mL G418. Approximately 1 month later, stable expression of functional TRPV1 receptors in the selected cell line was confirmed by validating Ca2+ responses with or without capsazepine (Sigma, at 1 nM-10 uM) in capsaicin assay.<br>
Capsaicin-induced Ca2* Influx Assay For Cell Selection:<br>
The following assay was performed to identify cells with hTRPVl expression. CHO-K1 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(-)-hVRl plasmid were seeded in 384-well black-wall clear-bottom plates (Corning) and cultivated in growth medium (see above) for 1 day. On the day of experiment, culture medium was exchanged to assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KC1, 0.9 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2, 5.6 mM D-glucose, 2.5 mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 4 fjM Fluo-3-AM (Dojin, Japan). Ar2er the incubation at 37°C for 1 hr, each well was washed 3 times with assay buffer using an EMBLA 384 plate washer (Molecular Devices) and refilled with assay buffer. The plates were incubated at a temperature of about 25°C for 10 min. Subsequently, the plates were inserted into a FLIPR, and 1.5 \iM capsaicin (Sigma) solution prepared in assay buffer was added to each well (final concentration was 500 nM). Cellular responses were monitored for 5 min.<br>

2.	Thawing the cells<br>
TRPV1/CHO cells were frozen in Cellbanker™ (Juji-Field INC, Japan, CAT: BLC-1) and stored at -80°C. Optimized cryopreservation solution containing dimethyl sulphoxide and FBS was used.<br>
Vials containing the TRPV1/CHO cells were stored at -80°C. Ar2er removal from -80°C, the vial was immediately transferred to a 37°C water bath to thaw for ca. 1-2 minutes. Once completely thawed, the contents of the vial (1 mL/vial) was transferred to a sterile 15 mL test tube and 9 mL warm culture media were slowly added. The test tube was subsequently centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 4 min at a temperature of about 25°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 10 mL of culture media. The cell suspension was transferred to a sterile 75 cm2 plastic flask and incubated at humidified 5% C02/95% air at 37°C. To monitor viability, the cells were visually inspected and/or counted, beginning at approximately 1 hr Ar2er incubation.<br>
3.	Passaging the Cells<br>
The cells in a flask were close to confluence at the time of passaging. Cell culture media were removed from the culture flask and 10 mL of sterile PBS(-) added and the flask gently shaken. The PBS was removed from the flask and 2 mL of trypsin/EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin with EDTA-4Na; Gibco, CAT: 25300-054) was added and the flask gently shaken. The flask was incubated at 37°C for about 2 min. 8 mL cell culture media were subsequently added to the flask and the flask shaken to ensure that all cells were in solution. The cell suspension was then transferred to a sterile 15 mL or 50 mL plastic tube, centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 4 min at a temperature of about 25°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in ca. 5 mL of culture media. The cell count was measured using the Burker-Turk hemocytometer.<br>
The cells were seeded into a sterile 75 cm2 plastic flask in ca. 0.8 x 105 cells/mL for 72 hr and incubated in humidified 5% C02/95% air at 37°C.<br>
4.	FreeZ1ng the cells<br>
The procedure up to the measurement of the cell count was the same as in the section Passaging the Cells above. Subsequently, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 4 min at a temperature of about 25°C. The supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in Cellbanker™ solution to get a final concentration of from 5 x<br>
105 to 5 x 106 cells/mL. The cell suspension was transferred into appropriately labeled 1 mL cryovials and then placed into the -80°C freezer.<br>
pH’Based Assay:<br>
The following assay was conducted to determine the concentration of sulfuric acid that would give rise to a pH that induces a Ca2+ response optimal to test compounds for their effect on TRPV1.<br>
1.	Cells<br>
TRPV1/CHO cells were seeded in the 96-well clear-bottom black-wall plate (Nunc) at densities of 1-2 x 104 cells/well and grown in 100 /JLL of culture medium (alpha-MEM supplemented with 10 % FBS, 20 mM HEPES, 1 mg/mL geneticin and 1 % antibiotic-antimycotic mixed stock solution) for 1-2 days before the experiment.<br>
2.	Determination ofpH Sensitivity and Agonist Dose<br>
2.1.	Aeonist Solution<br>
Different agonist solutions with sulfuric acid concentrations of from 15 mM to 18 mM (see Figure 1) were prepared by diluting 1M sulfuric acid with measuring buffer. The different sulfuric acid concentrations in the agonist solutions were selected such that a 1:4 dilution would result in a final sulfuric acid concentration of between 3.0 mM to 3.6 mM, respectively, as indicated in Figure 1.<br>
2.2.	Assay<br>
pH dependent Ca2+ responses in TRPV1/CHO cells cultured in a 96-well plate are shown in Figure 2. In particular, Ca2+ influx into TRPV1/CHO cells in response to low pH as measured by Fura-2 AM fluorescence is indicated in Figure 2. The cells were stimulated using 3.0 mM (well number B1-6), 3.1 mM(Cl-6), 3.2 mM(Dl-6), 3.3 mM (El-6), 3.4 mM (Fl-6), 3.5 mM (Gl-6), or 3.6 mM (Hl-6) H2SO4 or pH 7.2 measuring buffer without H2SO4 (Al-6) (Figure 2).<br>
(1)	Culture medium was removed using an 8-channel-pipette (Rainin, USA) from the 96-well plate and the wells were refilled with 100 /iL of loading buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KC1, 0.8 mM MgCl2,1.8 mM CaCl2, 13.8 mM D-glucose, 2.5mM probenecid, pH 7.4) containing 5 /iM Fura-2 AM (Dojin, Japan).<br>
(2)	The 96-well plate was incubated at 37°C for 45 min.<br>
(3)	The loading buffer was removed from each well. The cells were subsequently washed twice with 150 JJLL of measuring buffer (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM<br>
NaCl, 5.4 mM KC1, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5.0 mM CaCl2,13.8 mM D-glucose, 0.1 % BSA, pH 7.4) (no probenecid). The wells were then refilled with 80 /xL of measuring buffer.<br>
(4)	Ar2er an incubation at 4°C for 15 min, the 96-well plate was transferred to FDSS-3000 (Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan).<br>
(5)	The Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm and at 380 nm, respectively, at a rate of 0.5 Hz for a total of 240 seconds. Ar2er 16 time points (32 sec) of baseline detection, 20 fiL of agonist solution was added to each well. The final volume was 100 /iL/well.<br>
(6)	Fluorescence intensity ratio refers to the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm over the fluorescence intensity at 380 nm at a particular time point. The baseline was set as the average of the fluorescent intensity ratios for the first 16 time points before the addition of agonist solution. The maximum response was the highest fluorescent intensity ratio during the 60 time points following addition of agonist solution.<br>
(7)	Maximal signal ratios from each well were calculated as output data using the FDSS-3000 analysis program. Data were analyzed using Excel (Microsoft) and XLfit (idbs) software.<br>
2.3.	pH Determination<br>
Ar2er the observation of Ca2+ responses, the buffer of each lane (50 jiL/well, 8-20 wells/plate) was collected well by well and the pH values were measured using a portable pH meter (Shindengen, Japan).<br>
As shown in Figure 2, the Ca2+ responses in lanes D and E were intermediate and therefore optimal for testing the effects of compounds on the TRPV1 calcium channel. The final sulfuric acid concentrations in the wells of these lanes were 3.2 mM and 3.3 mM, respectively. These final sulfuric acid concentrations were obtained using agonist solutions with 16.0 mM and 16.5 mM sulfuric acid concentrations, respectively (lanes D and E in Figure 1). The pH obtained using these sulfuric acid concentrations wasca. 5.0-5.1.<br>
Thus, agonist solutions with 16.0 mM and 16.5 mM sulfuric acid concentrations, respectively, (lanes D and E in Figure 1) were selected for the experiments described below in section 3.<br>
3.	pH Assay 3.1. Agonist<br>
Two different agonist solutions with different H2SO4 concentrations were used for the pH assay (Figure 3A). For one half of a 96-well plate one agonist solution was<br>
used, for the other half the other agonist solution. The agonist solutions were obtained by diluting sulfuric acid (H2SO4, IM) with measuring buffer. The concentrations for the two agonist solutions were determined as described above in Section 2 of Protocol 2. The sulfuric acid concentrations between the two agonist solutions differed by 0.5 mM. In the experiment described in Section 2 of Protocol 2, the sulfuric acid concentrations in the agonist solutions were determined to be 16 mM and 16.5 mM, respectively. Ar2er 1:4 dilution of the agonist solutions, the final sulfuric acid concentration was 3.2 mM and 3.3 mM, respectively. The resulting pH value for the pH assay was 5.0 to 5.1.<br>
3.2.	Test Compounds<br>
Test compounds were dissolved in DMSO to yield 1 mM stock solutions. The stock solutions were further diluted using DMSO in 1:3 serial dilution steps with 6 points (1000 fiM, 250 /*M, 62.5 fiM, 15.625 /JM, 3.9062 (M and 0.977 pM). The thereby-obtained solutions were further diluted in measuring buffer (1:10O) as lOx stock serial dilutions with a DMSO concentration of 1%. 10 uL of a lOx stock was added into each well at step 3.3.(4) of Protocol 2. Thus, the final concentrations of antagonists ranged from 1000-0.977 nM containing 0.1% DMSO (Figure 3B).<br>
3.3.	Assay<br>
Steps (1) and (2) of this Assay were the same as steps 2.2.(1) and 2.2.(2) of Protocol 2, respectively.<br>
(3)	The cells were washed twice with 150 pL of measuring buffer (mentioned in 2.2.(3) of Protocol 2, no probenecid). The wells were subsequently refilled with 70 /iL of measuring buffer.<br>
(4)	Either 10 fiL of measuring buffer or 10 /JL of lOx stock serial dilution of test compound (described in 3.2. above) were applied to each well. Usually, only one test compound was tested per 96-well plate. The number of replicates per 96-well plate for a particular antagonist at a particular concentration was 7x2 since two different sulfuric acid concentrations were used per 96-well plate (N = 7 x 2)(Figure 3).<br>
Step (5) was the same as 2.2.(4) above.<br>
(6)	Fura-2 fluorescent intensity was monitored as described in 2.2.(5) above. Ar2er 16 time points of baseline detection, 20 [xL of agonist solution (measuring buffer titrated with H2SO4 to yield pH 5.0 - 5.1 when mixed 1:4 with the measuring buffer containing test compound) was added to each well (final volume 100 ^L/well).<br>
Steps (7) and (8) were as described in 2.2.(6) and 2.2.(7) above, respectively.<br>
3.4.	pH check<br>
(1)	The pH values of the buffer in the wells of Al -► HI and A7 -► H7 (longitudinally; Figure 3) were measured one by one using a portable pH meter.<br>
(2)	When a well was confirmed as pH 5.0 or 5.1, the next five wells to its right were checked one Ar2er another.<br>
(3)	For IC50 calculation, only the data from wells with pH values of 5.0-5.1 were used.<br>
The number of wells tested for their pH vAr1ed among plates (about 16-60 wells/plate). The number depended on the results of 3.4.(1) above and the Ca2+ responses.<br>
Cavsaicin-Based Assay:<br>
One day pR10r to assay, TRPV1/CHO cells were seeded in 96-well clear-bottom black plates (20,000 cells/well) in growth media. On the day of the experiment, the cells were washed with 0.2 mL lx Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies) containing 1.6 mM CaCl2 and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4 (“wash buffer”). Subsequently, the cells were loaded by incubation in 0.1 mL of wash buffer containing Fluo-4 at 3 ^M final concentration. Ar2er 1 hour, the cells were washed twice with 0.2 mL wash buffer and resuspended in 0.1 mL wash buffer. The plates were then transferred to a Fluorescence Imaging Plate Reader (Molecular Devices). Fluorescence intensity was monitored for 15 seconds to establish a baseline. Subsequently, test compounds diluted in assay buffer (lx Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution containing 1 mM CaCb and 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 1% DMSO were added to the cell plate and fluorescence was monitored for 2 minutes. The final concentration of the compound was adjusted to range from 100 jJVI to 1.5625 \JM. If the test compound was an especially potent antagonist, the final concentration of the compound was adjusted to range from 10 ^M to 1.5625 nM. Human TRPV1 was then activated by the addition of 50 uL capsaicin (100 nM final concentration) and plates incubated for an additional 3 min.
