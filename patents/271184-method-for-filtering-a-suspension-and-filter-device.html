METHOD FOR FILTERING A SUSPENSION AND FILTER DEVICE<br>
The invention relates, on the one hand, to a method for filtering a suspension which<br>
is initially inducted through a filling shoe into a filter chamber on a cake side of a filter<br>
cloth, permeates the filter cloth to a filtrate side of the filter cloth, and flows from the<br>
filter chamber on the filtrate side in a filtered state as a filtrate, while a solid content<br>
of the suspension is deposited on the filter cloth as a filter cake, wherein the filter<br>
chamber in a closed state of a filter device is configured between a filter plate and a<br>
counter plate, and the filling shoe is anchored.in the filter plate, and clamps the filter<br>
cloth with the filter plate in a sealing manner in the closed state, and wherein the<br>
filter device is subsequently opened, so that the filter plate and the counter plate<br>
have an offset and the filter cake is removed. Furthermore the invention relates to a<br>
filter device comprising at least one filter chamber, which is configured between a<br>
filter plate and a counter plate when the filter device is closed, into which filter<br>
chamber a suspension can be inducted on a cake side of a filter cloth through at<br>
least one filling shoe anchored in the filter plate and clamping the filter cloth with the<br>
filter plate in a sealing manner, and the suspension can permeate the filter cloth to<br>
the filtrate side thereof, wherein a solid content of the suspension can be deposited<br>
on the filter cloth as a filter cake, and the filter plate and the counter plate are at an<br>
offset from each other when the filter device is open, and the filter cake can be<br>
removed from the at least one filter chamber.<br>
Such filter devices with a plurality of filter plates as plate stacks and filter chambers,<br>
which are respectively configured between a filter plate and a second filter plate (as<br>
a counter plate), lying in parallel on the first filter plate or standing adjacent to it, are<br>
generally known e.g. from DE 199 56 617 A1. In the filter chambers, substantially in<br>
the respective separation plane between the filter plate and the associated counter<br>
plate, one or two filter cloths and a rubber elastic membrane are disposed depending<br>
on the configuration of the filter device. Subsequently, only the filter cloth is<br>
designated as filter cloth, which is clamped tight between a filter plate and a filling<br>
shoe anchored in the filter plate in a closed state of the filter device.<br>
During filtering operation of the known filter devices, the filter chambers are supplied<br>
through the filling shoes with a pressurized suspension, which is to be filtered, and<br><br>
the suspension is pressed through the filter cloths. Thus, the solid content of the<br>
suspension is deposited on the filter cloth as a filter cake. The filtered suspension<br>
from which the solid content is purged flows out from the filter chambers as a filtrate<br>
below the filter cloth substantially without pressure.<br>
After the filtration is completed, washing and pressing the filter cake, the filter<br>
chambers are opened one after the other by moving the respective filter plate and<br>
the associated counter plate away from one another to form an offset distance. In<br>
the open state, the filter cake is either removed respectively self-acting or with<br>
mechanical devices after the filtration is completed. When the filtering properties of<br>
the filter cloths are not sufficient anymore, the filling shoes inserted into the filter<br>
plates respectively through respective recesses of the filter cloths are manually<br>
disassembled, the filter cloths are removed from the filter chambers for removing the<br>
filter cake, the filter cake is removed from the filter cloths, and the filter cloths are<br>
cleaned or replaced as required and mounted again in the filter plates for reuse with<br>
the filter shoes.<br>
Besides the substantial manual complexity of mounting and dismounting the filter<br>
cloths, and the filling shoes anchored through clamping in the filter plates, which<br>
hinders a partial automation of the process cycle, also the service life of the filter<br>
cloths in the known filter devices is very limited. Through the high pressure loading,<br>
and depending on the method, occasional substantial temperature loading, the filter<br>
cloths extend during operation, so that the recesses provided for the filling shoes<br>
with respective seal rings do not coincide with the geometry of the filter plates after<br>
few process cycles. During filtering operation, these recesses either are not<br>
disposed exactly over the anchoring locations of the filling shoes or the filter cloth<br>
develops wrinkles between the anchoring locations. Both lead to respective<br>
leakages at the particular locations of the known filter devices, and otherwise lead to<br>
increased mechanical loading and early failure of the filter cloths.<br>
DE 103 03 817 A1 discloses such a method in which the filling shoe is pressed out<br>
by its own weight and by the weight of the membrane, when the filter device is<br>
opened.<br><br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is the object of the invention to assure the movability of the filter cloth and to<br>
simplify detaching the filter cloth.<br>
Solution<br>
Based on the known method, it is proposed according to the invention that the filling<br>
shoe automatically lifts off from the filter plate, when the filter device is opened,<br>
which liftoff releases the clamping of the filter cloth. Thus, the method according to<br>
the invention avoids the manual complexity of mounting and dismounting the filling<br>
shoes respectively for inserting and removing the filter cloth. The method according<br>
to the invention furthermore facilitates a movability of the filter cloth relative to the<br>
filter plate.<br>
Preferably, the filling shoe is lifted off from the filter plate through a spring force when<br>
opening the filter device, and during the closing process, the counter plate guides the<br>
filling shoe onto the filter plate against the spring force. Using a spring element<br>
provides a particularly simple option to implement the automatic liftoff of the filling<br>
shoe. Alternatively, the filling shoe can also lift off automatically through gravity a<br>
magnetic force or it can be lifted off from the filter plate through a mechanical drive or<br>
a fluid dynamic drive<br>
Based on the known filter devices, it is proposed according to the invention that the<br>
at least one filling shoe is movably anchored in the filter plate, and the filling shoe is<br>
automatically lifted off from the filter plate, and the clamping of the filter cloth is<br>
removed, when the filter device is opened. The filter device according to the<br>
invention facilitates performing one of the described methods and is characterized by<br>
the advantages recited therein.<br>
In a particularly preferred manner, the at least one filling shoe of a filter device<br>
according to the invention is anchored in the filter plate and pivotable about an axis<br>
parallel to the filter cloth. Thus, the clamping portion of the filling shoe, which clamps<br>
the filter cloth with the filter plate in a closed state of the filtering device, can be lifted<br><br>
off from the filter plate during opening, while the anchoring portion anchored in the<br>
filter plate remains substantially at the same location of the filter plate.<br>
Tilting the filling shoe can be implemented e.g. through support bushings and pins<br>
disposed in the axle, or also without specific support elements through a particular<br>
wedging in a receiver portion of the filter plate. Alternatively, the filling shoe can be<br>
anchored as a whole, so that it is movable perpendicular to the filter cloth.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of a filter device according to the invention, the at<br>
least one filling shoe is anchored in the filter plate outside a rectangular area covered<br>
by the filter cloth. The outer rim of the surface covered by the filter cloth in which the<br>
filter cloth is clamped between the filter plates and seals the filter chamber is<br>
designated as sealing surface. At the filter device according to the invention, the<br>
area covered by the filter cloth and thus also the seal face has a rectangular shape.<br>
The filling shoe anchored outside of this surface permeates the surface, so that it<br>
only becomes a pass-through element and therefore does not require specific<br>
recesses or special sealing installations in the filter cloth. The filter device according<br>
to the invention then facilitates using filter cloth by the meter without specific<br>
recesses for the filling shoes. On one side, the costs for the filter cloth are<br>
significantly reduced, on the other side, the problems described for the known filter<br>
devices through extension of the filter cloth are effectively avoided during operation.<br>
Embodiment<br>
The invention is subsequently described with reference to an embodiment, wherein<br>
FIG. 1	shows a filter plate of a filter device according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 2	shows a filling shoe of the filter device according to the invention;<br>
FIG. 3	shows a detail of a sectional view of the filter device according to the<br>
invention; and<br><br>
FIG. 4	shows another sectional view of the filter device according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The filter plate 1 made of PP shown in FIG. 1, which is part of a filter device<br>
according to the invention, which is not shown in more detail, has a substantially<br>
square basic shape, two load bearing extension pieces 2, 3 and two extension<br>
pieces 4, 5, which are non-load bearing and attached to this basic shape. A filtrate<br>
channel 6 respectively runs through the extension pieces 2, 3, 4, 5. Furthermore, a<br>
suspension channel respectively runs through the extension piece 2 on the top left<br>
and through the extension piece 4 on the bottom right, and a pressure medium<br>
channel 8 extends through the extension piece 3 on the top right. The filtrate<br>
channels 6, the suspension channels 7 and the pressure medium channel 8<br>
respectively extend transversal to the filter plate 1 through the filter device.<br>
The filter plate 1 comprises a chamber side 9 and a membrane side 10 placed<br>
opposite thereto, respectively configured with a lens shaped recess 11, which is<br>
illustrated in FIGS. 3 and 4. At the chamber side 9, two filling shoes 12 made of PP<br>
are anchored, which are disposed laterally at the recess 11 and diagonally opposed,<br>
through which filling shoes the suspension can be inducted into the filter device from<br>
the respectively associated suspension channel 7.<br>
As illustrated in FIG. 2, each filling shoe 12 comprises a suspension bore hole 13. In<br>
an anchoring portion 14, the filling shoe 12 comprises a support axis 16 defined by<br>
two support pinions 15. Opposite to the anchoring portion 14, the filling shoe 12<br>
comprises a clamping portion 18 provided with a seal element 17 made of rubber,<br>
wherein six inlet channels lead to said clamping portion starting at the suspension<br>
bore hole 13.<br>
In assembled state, the suspension bore hole 13 of the filling shoe 12 forms a<br>
section of the associated suspension channel 7 of the filter plate 1 as illustrated in<br>
FIG. 3. The support pinions 15 engage support bushings of the filter plate 1, which<br>
are not shown, so that the filling shoe 12 is anchored in the filter plate 1, and<br>
supported thereon pivotable about the support axis 16. With respect to the filter<br><br>
plate 1 and the counter plate, not shown in FIG. 3, the suspension bore hole 13 of<br>
the filling shoe 12 is sealed through circular annular seal elements 20.<br>
During operation of the filter device according to the invention, a so-called<br>
membrane filter press with vertically oriented filter plates 1, the filter plates 1 are<br>
compressed in a steel frame of a press frame, which is not shown, to form a plate<br>
pack 21, which is shown in a detail in FIG. 4. In the plate pack 21, the recesses 11<br>
of the adjacent filter plates 1 form respective filter chambers 22, wherein a respective<br>
filter plate 1 with its chamber side 9 is combined with the membrane side 10 of an<br>
additional filter plate 1 as a counter plate. In the separation plane between the filter<br>
plate 1 and the counter plate, one membrane 23 made from rubber and two filter<br>
cloths 24 are disposed respectively in the filter chamber 22.<br>
In order to assemble the filter device, the filter plates 1 are supported at the frame<br>
through the upper extension pieces 2, 3. The extension piece 4 at the bottom right is<br>
only bolted to the filter plates 1 after they are hung into the support frame. The other<br>
extension pieces 2, 3, 5 are integrally formed at the filter plates 1. When closing the<br>
filter chambers 22, the filter cloth 24 disposed between the filter chamber 22 and the<br>
clamping portion 18 of the filling shoe 12 is clamped there between.<br>
During filtering operation of the filter device, a suspension with a solid content is<br>
inducted through the filling shoes 12 respectively between the adjacent cake sides of<br>
the filter cloths 24 and into the filter chambers 22. During filtration, the suspension<br>
initially permeates the filter cloths 24 towards their filtrate sides and flows as a<br>
cleaned filtrate substantially without pressure from the filter chambers 22 into outlets,<br>
which are not shown. Thus, the solid content of the suspension is deposited on the<br>
cake sides of the filter cloths 24 as a filter cake, which is not shown.<br>
In order to remove the filter cake, the filter chambers 22 of the filter device are<br>
opened one after the other, so that they comprise a distance 25, through which the<br>
filter cake can be removed. When opening the filter chamber 22, the seal element<br>
between the filter plate 1 and the filling shoe 12, acting as a spring element, prevents<br>
an upward tilting of the filling shoe 12. The clamping of the filter cloth 24 is thus<br><br>
automatically removed and it can be removed easily, in particular without<br>
disassembling the filling shoe 12.<br><br>
