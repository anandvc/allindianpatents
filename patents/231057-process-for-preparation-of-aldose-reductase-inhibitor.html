				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF AN ALDOSE REDUCTASE INHIBITOR<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel aldose reductase inhibitor. More particularly, the present invention relates to a novel aldose reductase inhibitor of formula 1 derived from cultures of Aspergillus niger CFR 1046 and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof.<br><br>
Background of the invention<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Diabetes mellitus and its disabling complications which include blindness, renal failure, limb amputation, myocardial infarction affect millions of people (Schumacher, M.P. Diabetes 44 (1995)1355-1361). In the absence of or in cases of insufficient insulin, glucose accumulates in the blood of diabetics. Certain cells such as those in the peripheral nerves, the lens of the eye, or parts of the kidneys, however, do not need insulin to get glucose. As a result, maximum damage such as blindness, neuropathy and kidney damage occurs in such sites in diabetics. Nerve damage in diabetes is largely caused by loss of the insulating myelin sheath around nerves, which in turn causes message transmission to be erratic and painful, or non-existent. The reason this occurs is that when glucose enters these cells, it is converted into sorbitol by the enzyme aldose reductase (Aldilol:NADP't 1-oxidoredutase, EC 1.1.1.21) which catalyses the NADPH-linked reduction of a broad group of aldoses to respective alduronic acids (Wilson K.W., Boren K.M. and Gahbay K.H., Science 257 (1992) 3). Sorbitol is then slowly converted into fructose by sorbilol dehydrogenase. Neither sorbitol nor fructose can cross the membrothe and leave the cell easily, thereby causing damage as they accumulate. The resulting changes include changes in osmotic pressures, alterations in redox state of pyridine nucleotides (increased NADH/NAD ratio) and depleted intracellular levels of myoinositol (Larson ER, Lipinski CA and Sarges RMed Res Revs 8 (1988) 159-186).<br>
Since diabetics have larger than normal amounts of glucose in the blood, the damage can lead to the above-mentioned problems. Certain substances present naturally in foods, block aldose reductase and prevent cell damage. Vitamin C, Alpha Lipoic Acid, Licorice, and<br><br>
various citrus or other antioxidants, e.g. quercetin, are aldose reductase inhibitors (Kim H.Y and Oh J.H., Biosci. Biotech. Biochem 63 (1999) 184-188). Inhibitors against these enzymes<br>
thus have a potential application in both the food and medical sector.<br>
Traditionally in Japan, some kampo medicines (traditional oriental herbal prescriptions) have long been used for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy (Aida, K.,Tawata, M.,Shindo, H ,Onaya, T.,Sasaki, H.,Yamaguchi, T.,Chin, M.,Mitsuhashi. Planta Med, 56 (1990) 254-258). The authors investigated the components of (jlycyrrhizae radix, a constituent of some kampo medicines, and isolated six compounds (GUs 9-17). Among these, GU-17, identified as isoliquiritigenin, had the most potent aldose reductase inhibiting activity.<br>
Isoliquiritigenin inhibited rat lens aldose reductase with an ICsp of 3.2 x 10(-7) M using DL-glycerafdehyde as a substrate. It inhibited sorbitol accumulation in human red<br>
blood cells in vitro, with an ICso of 2.0 x 10(-6) M Isoliquiritigenin, when administered via an intragastric tube to diabetic rats, suppressed sorbitol accumulation in the red blood cells, the sciatic nerve, and the lens as effectively as ONO-2235. These results suggest that isoliquiritigenin may be effective in preventing diabetic complications.<br>
Among the natural compounds, flavonoid compounds such as quercetin, quercetrin, naringinin and hesperidin are reported to be useful and potent aldose reductase inhibitors (Aida, K., Tawata, M., Shindo, H., Onaya, T, Sasaki, H., Yamaguchi, T., Chin, M , Mitsuhashi. Planta Med, 56 (1990) 254-258).<br>
The presently known chemically synthesized aldose reductase inhibitors are Tolrestat, a chemically synthesised inhibitor with an IC50 of 3.5 X 10-8 M; and Sorbinil (Hollis HD, Johnson JL and Werbel LM. JMetiChem. 27 (1984) 255-256).<br>
Some inhibitors obtained through the fermentation route are Thiazocins obtained from the fermented broth of Aclhiosynnema sp (Ozasa T, Yoneda T, Hirasawa M, Suzuki K, Tanaka K, Kadota S and Iwanami M. J Antibiot 44 (1991) 768-773), Thermorubrin and 2-hydroxy acetic acid from Thermoactinomyces sp U FA 8 (Hayashi K, Dombou M, Sekiya M, Nakajima H ./ of Antibiot. 48 (1995) 1345 - 1346), Salfredins from Cntcibulum sps (Matsumoto K, Nagashima K, Kamigauchi T, JofAntibiot. 48 (1995) 439-446) and YUA001 from Corynebacterium sp (Bahn Y, Park J, Bai D, Takase S, Yu J,,/ of Antibiot. 51 (1998) 902-907) which has anIC50of 1.8 mM against pig kidney aldose reductase.<br>
The search is constantly on for new sources of aldose reductase inhibitors from natural sources that are inexpensive and show bettei activity.<br><br>

It is an object of the invention to locate and identify new natural srces for aldose reducatase inhibitors that are more economical and show better activity.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide new aldose reductase inhibitors that show improved actuivity and are obtained from natural sources.<br>

The inoculated flasks were incubated for 8 days at 30°C.<br>
Isolation and Purification<br>
Fermented broth (3 L) was treated with ethyl acetate (2 liter) for two hours followed by cheesecloth filtration to remove the biomass and the organic extract was separated from the broth by a separating funnel. This organic extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford a crude solid (0.42 gm). The residue was re-suspended in chloroform and dry coated on 0.5 gins silica gel. This was loaded on a 5 gm (60-120 mesh) silica gel column (25 X 1 cm;) packed in hexane. The compound was eluted as a deep yellow band in chloroform:ethylacetate (9:1) fraction. Solvent was evaporated in vacuo to obtain 25 mgs of amorphous red powder, designated as Compound 1. Physico-chemical properties<br>
Compund 1, is an amorphous red powder and is soluble in methanol, ethyl acetate,<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide, diethyl ether, sodium bicarbonate solution, sodium carbonate solution<br>

a Carbon-13 assignments are interchangeable.<br>
The physico-chemical data are summarized in Table 2. The UV spectra of this substance had an absorption maxima at pH 3.8 are 232, 265, 310 and at pH 9.0 are 226, 286, 355. The 1R spectrum (Fig 1) of compound 1 shows typical absorption bands at 3437, 2995, 2912 and 1660 cm"1. The 'H-NMR spectral data (Fig 2) of this compound and the UC-NMR spectral data (Table 3 and Fig 2) and the Mass fragmentation Spectra (Fig 3) of the compound are given Structure determination<br>
The spectral characteristics and other properties of the compound isolated are shown in Table 2 and Table 3 above. The compound exhibits UV absorption at 232 nm, 265 nm and 310 nm at pH 3.8. However at pH 9.0, while the λ1IJX at 232 nm showed a hypochromic shift to 226 nm both the 265 nm peak and 310 nm peak showed a bathochromic shift to 286 nm and 355 nm respectively. This indicates that there are ionizable phenolic groups on aromatic<br><br>
rings. The broad IR absorption at 3437 Cm-1 indicaies -OH stretching frequencies. The peak at 2995 Cm-1, 2912 Cm-1 indicate aromatic C-H stretching. A broad ketonic absorption bond in IR spectrum at 1660 Cm-1 indicating probabK hydrogen bonded keto group. Another conformation of stretching was obtained from iwo dimensional heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence transfer spectra (2DHMQCT) An aliphatic group corresponding to six carbons were observed at 0.8 ( CH3) and 0.8, 1.0, 1 2 and 1.5 (5 -CH2) ppm. The -CH2 at 1.0 ppm might have come from -CH2 group of hexyl moiety being subjected to ring current effect of the aromatic group present. Three separate single signals were seen at 6.0, 6.5 and 6.95 ppm, indicating aromatic protons. The corresponding 13C signals are as follows;<br>
29.9 (-CH-0, 31.5 (-CH2), 39.9 to 40.9 (-CH2), 111.1 (Ar-H), 108.9 (Ar-H), 108.2 (Ar-H), 190.8 (CO), 181.7 (CO), 164.4 (CAT OH). 163.6 (CAr- OH), 160.9 (CAr- O). EIMS analysis showed a parent peak at 205 (M+) other fragment peaks like 178 (M-CO), 150 (-CO), 108 and 81 clearly indicating aromatic group (if the molecule. However, parent ion peak was distinctly missing. Biased on EIMS and 2DHMQCT analysis the proposed structure is given below:<br><br>
