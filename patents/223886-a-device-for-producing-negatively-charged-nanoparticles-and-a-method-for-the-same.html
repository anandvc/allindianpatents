				<td>A DEVICE FOR PRODUCING NEGATIVELY CHARGED<br>
NANOPARTICLES AND A METHOD FOR THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device and method for producing<br>
nanoparticles, specifically to a device and method for producing novel<br>
negatively charged nanoparticles by combining two particles and electric<br>
charges in bioclimatology and physics, which are unrelated with each other,<br>
to be used in fields of medicine, home appliance, aseptic engineering,<br>
freshness preservation engineering, bioengineering, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In bioclimatology, the state of air environmental condition is called by<br>
scientific workers as the aerosol state. Molecule cluster, liquid and solid<br>
particles dispersed in air as aerosols are mostly nanoparticles.<br>
Nanoparticles exhibit small-scale effect, surface and interfacial effect<br>
and quantum-scale effect, and have large specific surface area and big<br>
number of atoms on the surface. Surface effect and interfacial effect are<br>
intensified with decreasing particle size. The big specific surface area and the<br>
big number of atoms on the surface increase the activity of the nanoparticle<br>
greatly. Due to the small-scale effect and surface effect, nanoparticles of<br>
different size also cause variation of surface electron spin conformation and<br>
electron energy spectra distribution. Quantum-scale effect of nanoparticles<br>
results in discrete energy level. The interval between energy levels changes<br>
with the changes of the nanoparticle sizes. Nanoparticles in aerosol are<br>
composed of different particles with different sizes. Because of the above-<br>
mentioned properties, nanoparticles greatly enhanced the ability to combine<br>
with electrons of different energy levels to form a very wide energy band of<br>
electron affinity.<br>
The problem is what kind of electron-emitting electrode can be used to<br>
achieve a strong enough electric field with narrowing potential barrier on the<br>
electrode surface. Due to the tunnel effect in quantum mechanics, electrons<br>
will penetrate and escape from the tunnel as field electron emission. How to<br>
increase the emission current density is a problem under research.<br>
In the 1960s, electrically charged aerosol centers were established in<br>
Texas and other states in the US. By ejecting pressurized gas the atomized<br>
physiological saline and electrons were emitted at the same time in the same<br>
direction at an electric potential of 26 kV-60 kV on an ejector to form<br>
electrically charged aerosol. Such aerosol was used to cure respiratory<br>
disease. It was effective in curing bronchitis and asthma, infection of the<br>
upper respiratory tract, emphysema, laryngitis, and pharyngitis. Besides the<br>
ejector, auxiliary equipments of gas pump, and liquid transport system were<br>
required. Atomized saline particles were mostly not nanoparticles. Even<br>
under the action of 26 kV-60 kV electric field, electrically charged aerosol<br>
could only travel a distance of about 1.8 m and disappeared beyond that<br>
distance. Such electrically charged aerosol was not able to directly participate<br>
in the electric metabolism at the tissue-cell-molecule level, so the biological<br>
effect and sterilizing effect were less promising.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to adopt an electron<br>
supermicroemitter at a micron-level or sub micron-level to provide very high<br>
emitter current density. When the electrode surface has a strong enough<br>
electric field, the potential barrier of electrode will narrow and electrons on<br>
the electrode will penetrate and escape from the tunnel because of tunnel<br>
effect in quantum mechanics to form field emission electrons, which can<br>
provide a very high emission current density.<br>
The present invention is to combine the physical characteristics of<br>
nanoparticles and the tunnel effect in quantum mechanics. When the<br>
electrons 'e' emitted by the electron emitting electrode collide with the<br>
particles in aerosol, the electrons can adjust the energy and adhere to the<br>
nanoparticles 'Nm' with a broad energy band of electron affinity to form new<br>
negatively charged nanoparticles 'N"m', that is to realize: e+Nm? Nm.<br>
Generally, there exist a few particles with different electric charges in<br>
air. Particles with and without electric charge can attract with each other and<br>
coalesce, resulting in combination of opposite charges and fall-off in large<br>
particles with the electric charge disappearing upon contact with ground. The<br>
negatively charged nanoparticles produced by the present invention appear in<br>
a large amount in a certain scope with same electric charges repelling each<br>
other. Scientists of bioclimatology and physics all think that such state of<br>
system is more stable.<br>
Such novel particles produced by using the physical characteristics and<br>
tunnel effect in quantum mechanics of nanoparticles inevitably leads to<br>
exclusively negatively charged nanoparticles without the presence of any<br>
other compounds or impurities.<br>
AMENDED SHEET (ARTCLE 34)<br>
The device for producing negatively charged nanoparticles of the<br>
present invention comprises a power supply, a casing, a controller and an<br>
electrode with only one potential, that is, an electron supermicroemitter,<br>
wherein, the power supply connects with the electron supermicroemitter and<br>
the controller respectively, and the potential of the electron<br>
supermicroemitter to the ground is controlled in the range of-2 kV to - 29kV.<br>
The said electron supermicroemitters are those with an electrode of an<br>
emitting body having a dimension at a micron level or sub-micron level. The<br>
material for preparing the said electron supermicroemitter of the present<br>
invention is platinum, gold, rhenium, iridium, tungsten or carbon fiber or<br>
their combination, or alloys with platinum, gold, rhenium, iridium and/or<br>
tungsten as the main components. The shape of the electrode could be any<br>
one or combination of the shapes selected from the group consisting of disk,<br>
cylinder, saw teeth, needle, sharp-ended, sphere, spheroid, arc, ring, bar, etc.<br>
The electron supermicroemitter could be a single electrode or multiple<br>
electrodes. The dimension of the electron supermicroemitter is 
The method for producing negatively charged nanoparticles according to the<br>
present invention is as follows. The negatively charged nanoparticles<br>
producing device constructed by connecting the power supply with the<br>
electron supermicroemitter and the controller respectively is used. The<br>
potential of the nanoparticles in air and the electron supermicroemitter to the<br>
ground, under the action of the power supply and the controller, are<br>
controlled in the range of - 2 kV to - 29 kV. Electrons emitted by tunnel<br>
effect combines with the nanoparticles to produce new negatively charged<br>
nanoparticles. The electric potential range is determined by the material,<br>
shape, and dimension of the electrode and the different application equipment<br>
as used.<br>
Field emission by tunnel effect generates electrons V of high electric<br>
current density, which upon colliding with particles in aerosol, can adjust the<br>
energy (for example, electrons of high energy can lose its energy or reduce its<br>
energy on collision) and adhere on nanoparticles 'Nm' of different sizes with<br>
a broad energy band (The nanoparticles in air consist of various molecule<br>
clusters—either in the solid state, liquid state or gaseous state—and<br>
nanoparticles of different sizes (10-7-10-9 m).). The reaction is as follows:<br>
e + Nm ?Nm<br>
Negatively charged nanoparticles are thereby produced. Under the<br>
action of electric field at any potential in the range of —2 kV to —29 kV, these<br>
particles can rapidly diffuse outward to cover a certain area.<br>
The said electron supermicroemitter can be made according to one of<br>
the following methods:<br>
a) Platinum, gold, or carbon fiber filament is fixed on a glass carriage by<br>
a soldering method. The leading-out end is made by bonding platinum, gold,<br>
or carbon fiber to copper wire with conducting glue (such as a conducting<br>
glue made of silver powder and epoxy resin). Platinum wire can be connected<br>
to the conductor with indium melted at a low temperature.<br>
b) Platinum, gold, rhenium, tungsten, iridium or carbon fiber filament is<br>
bonded and sealed in a carriage made of insulators made of quartz, glass, PE,<br>
PTFE (plastics), polyester fiber, silicon nitride, alumina (porcelain) with<br>
epoxy resin adhesive. The leading-out end is made by bonding platinum, gold,<br>
rhenium, tungsten, iridium or carbon fiber filament to copper wire with<br>
conducting glue (such as a conducting glue made of silver powder and epoxy<br>
resin). Fixation of the leading-end and the conductor can follow the same<br>
procedures as mentioned in method "a".<br>
c) Platinum, gold, rhenium, tungsten, iridium or carbon fiber filament is<br>
arranged on the surface of an insulator in such shapes as bar, ring, arc, etc. It<br>
is then fixed and bonded with adhesive, such as epoxy resin. Fixation of the<br>
insulator, the leading-out end and the conductor can follow the same<br>
procedures as mentioned in methods "a" and "b".<br>
d) Rhenium, tungsten or its corresponding alloy are made into electrodes<br>
of various shapes by electrolytic corrosion, such as the sharp-ended shape,<br>
needle shape, saw teeth shape, etc. In regard to the electrolytic corrosion, it<br>
has been taught in various common textbooks or literatures. The electrode<br>
made hereby is fixed on an insulator carriage with epoxy resin or riveted on<br>
an insulator carriage. According to the method of fixation, the insulator can<br>
be quartz, glass, PE, PTFE (plastics), silicon nitride, alumina (porcelain),<br>
polyester composite plate, etc. The leading-out end can be bonded to the<br>
conductor with conducting glue, or the leading-out wire and the electrode can<br>
be fixed on an insulator at the same time by mechanical means. The<br>
connection is illustrated by the following two examples. There are options for<br>
fixing and leading-out of the saw-teeth shaped electrode. One is the use of an<br>
epoxy resin and conducting glue. Saw teeth electrode is bonded with an<br>
epoxy resin to the insulator located underneath with one side of electrode<br>
connected to leading-out wire with conducting glue. The other is mechanical<br>
means. According to the mechanical means, saw teeth electrode is fastened<br>
with rivets on an insulator by clamps on both sides and the leading-out wire<br>
is riveted with a clamp on one side of the electrode.<br>
The sharp-ended and needle electrode can also use the above options<br>
except for some specific structure. For example, fixing clamp is not required<br>
for the needle electrode. A pin sleeve or rivet sleeve is used to fasten the<br>
electrode and lead wire directly on the insulator.<br>
e) Photoetching can be used to make electron supermicroemitter.<br>
According to this method, a uniform metallic film is coated on an insulator<br>
plate by spraying or sputtering. The metal film can be made of platinum, gold,<br>
iridium, etc. A photosensitive polymer film of polyimide is coated on the<br>
metallic film, and photoetching is carried out to form an electrode with a<br>
required shape. The matrix material of the electrode can be Si/SiO2, quartz,<br>
glass, silicon nitride, etc. Leading-out wire is made by bonding the electrode<br>
to copper wire with conducting glue.<br>
The sizes of the negatively charged nanoparticles are smaller than those<br>
of red blood cells in blood and ordinary bacteria, and are a fraction of the<br>
latter or even much smaller. Such nanoparticles can enter human body<br>
through respiration and skin mucous membrane into the lung and blood<br>
circulation and release electric charge. The equilibrium state of electric<br>
charges on cell wall can be improved to form bio-electricity having direct<br>
biological effect on physiological condition, tissue cells and metabolism of<br>
human body.<br>
Negatively charged nanoparticles in human body can directly participate<br>
in electro-metabolism at tissue-cell-molecule level, promoting transform of<br>
bio-electricity, adjusting electric potential equilibrium of organism, and<br>
improving natural physiological condition and biochemical environment of<br>
human body. The non-specific and broad-spectrum medical effect is achieved<br>
through the adjusting function of nerve-humor.<br>
Negatively charged nanoparticles with apparent biological effect have<br>
apparent conditioning opsonic function on neural system, cardio-vascular<br>
system, respiratory system, urinary system and digestive system and have<br>
curative effect on many diseases. Clinical application of the negatively<br>
charged nanoparticles has caught wide attention.<br>
Experimental studies demonstrate that, due to the quantum mechanics<br>
characteristics, the negatively charged nanoparticles can rapidly cover a<br>
certain scope and strongly inhibit the growth of and eradicate such harmful<br>
bacteria and viruses as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, syphilis spirochete,<br>
staphylococcus, bacillus coli, mycosis, Monilia, etc.<br>
It is well known that research and application of bioelectricity have been<br>
developing continuously. Clinical application of electroencephalogram<br>
(EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electrogastrogram (EGG) has saved the<br>
lives of countless people. Just like the clinical application of physical medical<br>
diagnosis equipment, the computerized tomography (CT), brightness type<br>
ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, nuclear magnetic resonance apparatus, and<br>
positive electron tomography have opened a new era for the uninterrupted<br>
development of clinical diagnosis. Bioelectricity of negatively charged<br>
nanoparticles will create many new techniques and new equipment,<br>
especially in clinical treatment.<br>
Therefore, bioelectricity of negatively charged nanoparticles can be<br>
widely used in physical medical equipment, home appliance, bioengineering,<br>
freshness preservation engineering, aseptic engineering and environmental<br>
condition improvements.<br>
