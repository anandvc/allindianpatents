CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Serial No. 11/651,102, filed January 5, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF ART The present invention relates generally to searching data and, more particularly, but not exclusively to grouping search results into clusters that are ordered according to search relevance.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Tremendous changes have been occurring in the Intemet that influence our everyday lives. For example, in today's society, mobile computing devices are becoming increasingly more common. Many mobile computing devices, such as personal digital assistants, cellular phones, and the like, may be employed to communicate voice messages, emails, text messages, and so forth, as well as to search for information over the Intemet. It is not uncommon to see a person on a bus, train, or even a boat, to be using their mobile devices to search for merchants, restaurants, music, businesses, or the like.<br>
However, performing a search query for user relevant information still remains cumbrous. Often, the user might have to perform several search queries to obtain relevant search results. Irrelevant search results mean that the user is less likely to fmd when they are looking for, which in turn may translate into lost opportunities for merchants, or other businesses, to prosper from the user. Therefore, many businesses are searching for new ways to make search results more relevant to the user. One technique is to group search results that match submitted search terms. Some search systems provide predefined groups of data types for search results, such as web pages, images, videos, local results, shopping related results, jobs, news, advertisements, and the like. The groups are typically arranged in the same order and each group typically includes only one data type.<br>
 <br>
Another technique is to determine groups based on textual similarity of the search results. However, textually similar groups generally do not take into account any information about the searcher. Consequently, the groups that are determined by textual similarity may not be the most relevant groups to the searcher. Similarly, a ranking of textually similar groups may not be in an order that is most relevant to the searcher. Current grouping systems also generally provide only brief summary information and links to the search results. A returned search results page generally does not include any substantive content without links based on the search terms. Thus, it is with respect to these considerations and others that the present invention has been made.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Non-limiting and non-exhaustive embodiments of the present invention are described with reference to the following drawings. In the drawings, like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures unless otherwise specified.<br>

As illustrated in FIGURE 3, server device 300 also can communicate with the Intemet, or some other communications network, via network interface unit 310, which is constructed for use with various communication protocols including the TCP/IP protocol. Network interface unit 310 is sometimes known as a transceiver, transceiving device, or network interface card (NIC).<br>
The mass memory as described above illustrates another type of computer-readable media, namely computer storage media. Computer storage media may include volatile, nonvolatile, removable, and non-removable media implemented in any method or technology for storage of information, such as computer readable instructions, data structures, program modules, or other data. Examples of computer storage media include RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disks (DVD) or other optical storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to store the desired information and which can be accessed by a computing device.<br>
The mass memory also stores program code and data. One or more applications 350 are loaded into mass memory and run on operating system 320. Examples of application programs may include transcoders, schedulers, calendars, database programs, word processing programs, HTTP programs, customizable user interface programs, IPSec appUcations, encryption programs, security programs, VPN programs, SMS message servers, IM message servers, email servers, account management and so forth. A search module 352 and/or a search clustering module 354 may also be included as an application program within applications 350 or as a separate application.<br>
 <br>
Search module 352 is configured to receive search terms from client devices, determine other search parameters, perform searches of data sources, provide search resuhs, and perform other search related operations. Search clustering module 354 may be part of, or separate from search module 352. Search clustering module 354 is configured to organize search results into groups and rank the groups of results. Search module 352 and/or search clustering module 354 may employ a process substantially similar to that described below.<br>
Generalized Operation<br>
The operation of certain aspects of the invention will now be described with respect to FIGURES 4-8. FIGURE 4 is an illustration of a search results display 400 on a mobile device. The entire search results may be scrolled through a display of limited area. In addition to search results, content can be displayed among the search results. Content may include information related to a submitted search term 401, such as content 402. Alternatively, or in addition, content may include location information 404, an advertisement, or other information. Generally, content information is formatted to appear similar to search resuUs, although content may be formatted in any other way.<br>
A first cluster element 406 indicates a first cluster of search results. The cluster element may be selected to toggle between an expanded view of search results and a closed view of only the cluster element. The cluster element may also comprise a search result itself The first cluster of search results is displayed near the top of resuUs display 400. The first cluster generally includes search results that are most relevant to the submitted search term. A cluster includes search results of one or more particular data types, such as local listing information, news articles, web page links, images, shopping information, other suggested searches, and the like. For example, first cluster element 406 indicates a cluster of local listing information for coffee stores identified by the search term and within a predefined radius of a mobile device location. In this example, local listing information was determined to be the most relevant cluster of information based on a number of factors, such as the search term, information determined from aggregate analysis of click streams (selections made by numerous users) after entering the search term, prior behaviors of the user in during the search term, location of the mobile device, and/or other information. This particular search term 401 is associated with the concept of retail stores and with the concept of a company. However, the concept of retail stores<br>
 <br>
is likely to have a higher relevance to more users than the concept of a company. Thus, the cluster of local listing information is ranked as the first cluster.<br>
The search results of a cluster can also include content indicating a data type or other information. For instance, a symbol 408 can indicate a tj'pe of information provided in the search result. In addition, or alternatively, a logo or other content may be placed on one or more search results, such as based on a paid placement. A selectable expansion control element 409 can be used to display additional results in a cluster.<br>
A second ranked cluster is displayed after the first ranked cluster. In this example, a second rank cluster element 410 identifies a cluster that includes multiple data types of search results. This sample cluster includes a web site search result 410, a stock quote search result 412, and a link to specialized company profile information 414. This cluster illustrates a cluster type that is defined to include multiple specific data types. Alternatively, a cluster type can be generated with multiple data types that may be determined based on search criteria and/or other information. As shown by the second ranked cluster, customized cluster types can be defined to include multiple data types of search results and/or content.<br>
Other cluster types may include a single data type of search results, such as the first rank cluster, third-ranked cluster 412, and fourth ranked 414. In those cases, the cluster type may be equivalent to the date type. Lower rank clusters may also be displayed with fewer search results, or with only space a cluster selection element. For example, low ranked clusters 416 are displayed with only cluster selection elements that require the user to select a cluster selection element to expand the view of corresponding search results. Thus, the relevance of clusters can be indicated by location, size, and other attributes.<br>
The search term used in FIGURE 4 is generally a topical search term that is related to relatively intuitive concepts. Some search terms are not so intuitive. FIGURE 5 shows one example of a search results page 500 for a search term 501 that is less intuitively related to concepts for which a user would likely want search results. The search term "today," by itself, may not immediately suggest certain data types of search results that a user probably desires. This search term may indicate a concept of a newspaper title, a morning television show, or other unrelated concept. In this case, contextual information, such as the location of the mobile device, may provide a better indication of the user's intent. Thus, context information may be<br>
 <br>
given more weight to determine which data sources to search and how to rank clusters of search resuhs. If the mobile device is in New York City, and the user enters the search term "today," the user is likely to be searching for information relevant to daily life in the city.<br>
Such information may include content related to this city on the current day. For example, date content 504 may provide the current date and enable the user to access a calendar. Similarly, whether or information 506 may display current and forecasts weather conditions in the city. One or more advertisements 502 may also be included. Each ofthese content items may be obtained from a specialized data source or fi-om an individual data source in the same manner that clusters of search results, are obtained. This content cluster, or each content item, can also be ranked relative to other clusters as if the content cluster or content item were just another cluster among the plurality of clusters of search results. In this case, the content information may be considered the first ranked cluster. A traffic alerts cluster 508 would be considered the second ranked cluster. Similarly, local news cluster 510 would be the third ranked cluster, sports cluster 514 would be the fourth ranked cluster, and so on. The clusters of search results may not have data types that are intuitively associated with the search term, but contextual data can be used to obtain and rank clusters of relevant search results.<br>
FIGURE 6 illustrates a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of an overall process 600 for searching data and ranking clusters of search results and/or content. The process may be performed by a server, a combination of servers, a standalone computing device, and/or other configurations of software modules and/or computing devices. To simplify the discussion, the following embodiment is described in terms of a single server in communication with a single mobile client device. At an operation 602, a human administrator may predefined certain concepts, cluster types, data types, concept processing rules, context rules, relevance scoring rules, and/or other information that may be used to determine data sources, rank search results, rank clusters of search results, add content, determine user preferences, determine user behaviors, and/or perform other operations. Alternatively, or in addition, automated analyses can be performed to determine one or more of the above information types, operational rules, and/or other data. For example, clicked stream analysis can be performed on aggregated data to determine multipliers and/or other factors that may be used in determining the resources and/or ranking information. In another embodiment, no such preprocessing is performed.<br>
 <br>
At an operation 604, the server receives one or more search terms from the mobile device. To simplify the discussion, a single search term will be assumed. Iterative processing and/or other logic can be used in alternate embodiments. The server may also receive, or obtain, context data at an operation 606. For example, the server may check a user's current location, the current application running on the mobile device, the mobile device profile data, online profile data for preferences, behaviors, past purchases, social networking relationships, and/or other user-specific data. Similarly, the server may obtain or calculate aggregated data from click stream analyses and/or other statistical analyses. The contextual information can be used to adjust default weighting multipliers prior to and/or during search processing. In another embodiment, no contextual data is received or determined. Some additional examples of contexts may include, but are not limited to:<br>
*	web page or screen of the client device used to submit the search term<br>
*	tracked behavior of a user (e.g. purchase history, number of searches)<br>
*	user-specific data (e.g. demographic data such as gender)<br>
*	time of day at the time of query<br>
*	time zone of the uSer<br>
*	search query characteristics (e.g. language, length of query, media type)<br>
*	data plan of the device or user<br>
*	device capabilities or characteristics (e.g. screen size)<br>
*	user expressed preferences (e.g. don't render images)<br>
*	proximity (e.g. to other devices or other users)<br>
*	direction of the device (e.g. device is facing north)<br>
*	movement of the device (e.g. device is going north, device is moving at lOmph)<br>
*	tracked behavior or other context of users related to user initiating search;<br>
*	social network (e.g. user A's friends search for sports, so sports are more relevant for user A)<br>
*	network characteristics (e.g. speed)<br>
*	content ovmed by the user or on a device used by the user, which can be, but does not have to be the same as the mobile device (e.g. user has a document on their PC relevant to a search done on the mobile device)<br>
At a decision operation 608, the server determines whether any known concepts are identified from the submitted search term. The server may perform a lookup operation for concepts associated with the search term, or may perform other interpretations, such as natural language processing, to determine concepts. Concepts generally identify categories of information related to the search term. For example, the search term "Chicago" is related to the<br>
 <br>
concept of a city and the concept of a play. As another example, the search term "Chicago pizza" is related to the concept of a style of pizza and the concept of food in the city of Chicago.<br>
Each concept may be associated with one or more particular data sources. For instance, play or movie schedules for local theaters may be in specific data sources that would not normally be searched unless it is determined that the user intends the search term to be associated with a play or movie. Other examples of concept-specific data sources may include, but are not limited to:<br>
<br>
web	stock quote data	part inventory data<br>
wap	dates/personals	photos<br>
image	dictionary	plane schedules<br>
photos	email	podcasts<br>
video	entertainment	printed materials<br>
local listings	encyclopedia	products<br>
news	events	ringtones<br>
weather	ferry schedules	RSS<br>
multimedia	finance	screensavers<br>
address books	flight status	shopping<br>
astrology	games	sports<br>
audio	inventory	thesaurus<br>
books	job	time<br>
bus schedules	landmarks	timezones<br>
celebrities	lottery	train schedules<br>
cities	movie show times	translations<br>
classifieds	movie theaters	traffic<br>
consumables	movies	TV showtimes<br>
countries	music	wallpapers<br>
currency	people	venues<br>
Each concept-specific data source may include a single data type of data, such as all stock quote data. Alternatively, a concept-specific data source may actually comprise multiple data sources with the same or differing data types. If the server identifies any concepts fi'om the search term, the server searches corresponding concept-specific data sources at an operation 610. More details on one embodiment of the concept-specific search process are provided below with regard to the description of FIGURE 7. The search results fi-om each concept-specific data source comprises a cluster of search results. The cluster type of a cluster may be the same as the data type or a custom cluster type of multiple data types.<br>
 <br>
After searching concept-specific data sources, or if no concepts were identified, the server determines whether any context data was submitted or is available, at a decision operation 612. If context data is available, the server looks up or determines associations between the context data and context-specific data sources. The server searches the associated context-specific data sources at an operation 614. The search results fi-om each context-specific data source comprises another cluster of search results. As above, a context-specific data source may include a single data type of data, such as all restaurant listings within a certain radius of the mobile device's current location. Alternatively, a context-specific data source may comprise multiple data sources with the same or differing data types. Accordingly, the cluster type of a cluster may be the same as the data type or a custom cluster type of multiple data types.<br>
After searching context-specific data sources, or if no context data was available, the server search is nonspecific data sources at an operation 616. Nonspecific data sources may comprise data that will always be searched, such as web page indices, news data, images, shopping data, and the like. At an operation 618, the server orders the results in each cluster of search results obtained fi-om each data source. The search results within a cluster are generally rank based on relevance of the search results to the search term. A number of techniques may be used to rank the search results within a cluster. Weighting factors, rules, and/or other processing may utilize aggregate click stream data, users specific click stream data, user behavior information, and/or other information. In some cases, special clusters are populated with search results fi-om multiple data sources and rank, at an operation 620.<br>
At an operation 622, the server determines a score for each cluster as a whole. The server may determine a cluster score with relevance scores of the search results within the cluster. For example, the server may determine a weighted average based on a cumulative score of the relevance scores and based on a predefined, or dynamically determined, factor. Each cluster score may be modified an operation 624, based on concepts and or context data. Further detail regarding this operation is described below with regard to FIGURE 8. All of the clusters are then arranged in an order at an operation 626, based on the cluster scores.<br>
In this example embodiment, a search results web page is generated with the ordered clusters, such as those web pages illustrated in FIGURES 4 and 5. Additional content, such as non-cluster advertising, logos, and/or other content may be added to the search results web page<br>
 <br>
at an operation 628. The search results web page is then returned to the mobile device for display.<br>
Further detail is now provided regarding operation 610. FIGURE 7 illustrates a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of a process 700 for determining and searching concept-specific data sources. At a decision operation 702, the server determines whether or multiple concepts were identified fi-om the search term. If only a single concept was identified, the server searches the corresponding concept-specific data source at an operation 712. If multiple concepts were identified, the server determines a score for each concept at an operation 704. As with the cluster score, a concept score can be determined based on relevance of the concept to the search term and/or based on aggregate analyses.<br>
And a decision operation 706, the server checks whether or any context data was received or determined. If context data is available, the server applies context-specific multipliers to the concept scores. The muhipliers may be predefined or dynamically determined to indicate a relevance of each concept to each context.<br>
After modifying the concept scores, or if no context data is available, the server determines the most relevant concept, at an operation 710. The server may select a single most relevant concept or may rank the concepts. At an operation 712, the server searches one or more concept specific data sources associated with the most relevant concept. Alternatively, the server may search concept-specific data sources for each of the ranked concepts. To simplify the discussion, this example embodiment chooses the most relevant concept and searches a single corresponding concept-specific data source. The search results comprise a concept-specific cluster.<br>
Further detail is now provided regarding operation 610 of FIGURE 6. FIGURE 8 illustrates a logical flow diagram generally showing one embodiment of a process 800 for modifying cluster scores. At a decision operation 802, the server checks whether any concepts were identified fi-om the search term. If a concept was identified, the server applies a multipUer, at an operation 804, to the cluster score of a corresponding cluster that is associated with the concept.<br>
 <br>
After applying a concept multiplier, or if no concepts were identified, the server checks whether or any context data is available, at a decision operation 806. If context data is available, the server applies one or more context-specific multipliers to the concept scores. The modified concept scores are then returned for subsequent ordering of the clusters.<br>
