				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to data communications. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to dynamically adjusting data packet transmission rates and size.<br>
Background<br>
[0002]	Computers, mobile telephones, mobile telephone cameras and video<br>
capture devices, personal data assistants, electronic game related products and various video technologies (e.g., DVD's and high definition VCRs) have advanced significantly over the last few years to provide for capture and presentation of increasingly higher resolution still, video, video-on-demand, and graphics images. Combining such visual images with high quality audio data, such as CD type sound reproduction, DVD?, and other devices having associated audio signal outputs, creates a more realistic, content rich, or true multimedia experience for an end user. In addition, highly mobile, high quality sound systems and music transport mechanisms, such as MP3 players, have been developed for audio only presentations to users.<br>
[0003]	The explosion of high quality data presentation drove the need to<br>
establish specialized interfaces that could transfer data at high data rates, such that data quality was not degraded or impaired. One such interface is a Mobile Display Digital Interface (MDDI), used, for example, to exchange high speed data between the lower and upper clamshells of a cellular telephone that has a camera. MDDI is a cost-effective, low power consumption, transfer mechanism that enables very-high-speed data transfer over a short-range communication link between a host and a client.  MDDI requires a minimum <br>
of just four wires plus power for bi-directional data transfer that with present<br>
technology can deliver a maximum bandwidth of up to 3.2 Gbits per second.<br>
|0004]	While MDD1 and other data interfaces can be used to efficiently<br>
provide high speed data rates across interfaces, there are increasing needs to optimize performance and more effectively use digital transmission links, such as an MDDI link. Specifically, there is a need to dynamically adjust bandwidth allocation within an MDDI link to adjust for changing latency requirements that depend on the particular operating mode of a device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	The present invention provides systems and methods for adaptive<br>
digital data transmission rate control. A digital data transmission system for adaptively transferring packets over a transmission link includes a client device having a bandwidth control module and a host device coupled to the client device over the transmission link. The host device includes one or more bandwidth control registers and a packet builder. The bandwidth control module determines a packet speed and/or size for packets transmitted from the host device to the client device over the transmission link. Requested packet speed and/or size are stored within bandwidth control registers.<br>
[0006]	The invention also provides a method for adjusting the transmission<br>
rate of packets over a transmisoion link that couples a client device and a host device within an electronic device. The method includes determining a change of state within the electronic device. Based on the change of state, the client device determines a desired transmission rate and/or packet size. Once a desired transmission rate and/or packet size is determined, the client device transmits the desired transmission rate and/or packet size to the host device. Upon receipt of the desired rate and/or packet size, the host device stores the transmission rate within a register in the host device. When the host device sends a packet to the client device, the host device accesses the register<br>
containing the transmission rate and/or packet size and transmits packets with a rate and/or size in accordance with the contents of the register.<br>
[0007]	In one embodiment the transmission link is an MDDI link. The<br>
invention, however, is not limited to MDDI links, and can be used with digital transmission links in which an electronic device changes states, such that dynamically controlling transmission rates and packet sizes to adaptively improve latency will improve overall system performance.<br>

well as the structure and operation of the various embodiments of the invention are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>

However, it should be appreciated that such descriptions are merely for convenience and that such actions in fact result from computing devices, processors, controllers, or other devices executing the firmware, software, routines, instructions, etc.<br>
[00021]	FIG. 1 is a diagram of a digital data device interface 100 coupled to a<br>
digital device 150 and a peripheral device 180. Digital device 150 can include, but is not limited to, a cellular telephone, a personal data assistant, a smart phone or a personal computer. In general digital device 150 can include a digital device that serve as a processing unit for digital instructions and the processing of digital presentation data. Digital device 150 includes a system controller 160 and a link controller 170.<br>
[00022]	Peripheral device 180 can include, but is not limited to, a camera, a bar<br>
code reader, an image scanner, an audio device, and a sensor. In general peripheral 180 can include audio, video or image capture and display devices in which digital presentation data is exchanged between a peripheral and a processing unit. Peripheral 180 includes control blocks 190. When peripheral 180 is a camera, for example, control blocks 190 can include, but are not limited to lens control, flash or white LED control and shutter control. Digital presentation data can include digital data representing audio, image and multimedia data.<br>
[00023]	Digital data interface device 100 transfers digital presentation data at a<br>
high rate over a communication link 105. In one example, an MDDI communication link can be used which supports bi-directional data transfer with a maximum bandwidth of 3.2 Gbits per second. Other high rates of data transfer that are higher or lower than this example rate can be supported depending on the communications link. Digital data interface device 100 includes a message interpreter module 110, a content module 120, a control module 130 and a link controller 140.<br>
[00024]	Link controller 140, which is located within digital data interface 100,<br>
and link controller 170, which is located within digital device 150 establish<br>
communication link 105. Link controller 140 and link controller 170 may be MDDI link controllers.<br>
[00025]	The Video Electronics Standards Association ("VESA") MDDI<br>
Standard, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes the requirements of a high-speed digital packet interface that lets portable devices transport digital images from small portable devices to larger external displays. MDDI applies a miniature connector system and thin flexible cable ideal for linking portable computing, communications and entertainment devices to emerging products such as wearable micro displays. It also includes information on how to simplify connections between host processors and a display device, in order to reduce the cost and increase the reliability of these connections. Link controllers 140 and 170 establish communication path 105 based on the VESA MDDI Standard.<br>
[00026]	U.S. Patent No. 6,760,772, entitled Generating and Implementing a<br>
Communication Protocol and Interface for High Data Rate Signal Transfer, issued to Zou et al. on July 6, 2004 ('772 Patent") describes a data interface for transferring digital data between a host and a client over a communication path using packet structures linked together to form a communication protocol for presentation data. Embodiments of the invention taught in the '772 Patent are directed to an MDDI interface. The signal protocol is used by link controllers, such as link controllers 140 and 170, configured to generate, transmit, and receive packets forming the communications protocol, and to form digital data into one or more types of data packets, with at least one residing in the host device and being coupled to the client through a communications path, such as communications path 105.<br>
[00027]	The interface provides a cost-effective, low power, bi-directional,<br>
high-speed data transfer mechanism over a short-range "serial" type data link, which lends itself to implementation with miniature connectors and thin flexible cables. An embodiment of link controllers 140 and 170 establishes communication path 105 based on the teachings of the '772 Patent. The '772 Patent is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
 [00028]	Furthermore, the host includes one of several types of devices that can<br>
benefit from using the present invention. For example, a host could be a portable computer in the form of a handheld, laptop, or similar mobile computing device, such as is depicted in as digital device 150. It could also be a Personal Data Assistant (PDA), a paging device, or one of many wireless telephones or modems. Alternatively, a host device could be a portable entertainment or presentation device such as a portable DVD or CD player, or a game playing device.<br>
[00029]	Furthermore, the host can reside as a host device or control element in<br>
a variety of other widely used or planned commercial products for which a high speed communication link is desired with a client. For example, a host could be used to transfer data at high rates from a video recording device to a storage based client for improved response, or to a high resolution larger screen for presentations. An appliance such as a refrigerator that incorporates an onboard inventory or computing system and/or Bluetooth connections to other household devices, can have improved display capabilities when operating in an internet or Bluetooth connected mode, or have reduced wiring needs for in-the-door displays (a client) and keypads or scanners (client) while the electronic computer or control systems (host) reside elsewhere in the cabinet. In general, those skilled in the art will appreciate the wide variety of modern electronic devices and appliances that may benefit from the use of this interface, as well as the ability to retrofit older devices with higher data rate transport of information utilizing limited numbers of conductors available in either newly added or existing connectors or cables.<br>
[00030]	At the same time, a client could comprise a variety of devices useful<br>
for presenting information to an end user, or presenting information from a user to the host. For example, a micro-display incorporated in goggles or glasses, a projection device built into a hat or helmet, a small screen or even holographic element built into a vehicle, such as in a window or windshield, or various speaker, headphone, or sound systems for presenting high quality sound or music. Other presentation devices include projectors or projection<br>
devices used to present information for meetings, or for movies and television images. Another example would be the use of touch pads or sensitive devices, voice recognition input devices, security scanners, and so forth that may be called upon to transfer a significant amount of information from a device or system user with little actual "input" other than touch or sound from the user. In addition, docking stations for computers and car kits or desk-top kits and holders for wireless telephones may act as interface devices to end users or to other devices and equipment, and employ either clients (output or input devices such as mice) or hosts to assist in the transfer of data, especially where high speed networks are involved.<br>
[00031]	However, those skilled in the art will readily recognize that the present<br>
invention is not limited to these devices, there being many other devices on the market, and proposed for use, that are intended to provide end users with high quality images and sound, either in terms of storage and transport or in terms of presentation at playback. The present invention is useful in increasing the data throughput between various elements or devices to accommodate the high data rates needed for realizing the desired user experience.<br>
(00032]	The inventive MDDI and communication signal protocol may be used<br>
to simplify the interconnect between a host processor, controller, or circuit component (for example), and a display within a device or device housing or structure (referred to as an internal mode) in order to reduce the cost or complexity and associated power and control requirements or constraints of these connections, and to improve reliability, not just for connection to or for external elements, devices, or equipment (referred to as an external mode).<br>
|00033]	Wireless communication devices each have or comprise apparatus such<br>
as, but not limited to, a wireless handset or telephone, a cellular telephone, a data transceiver, or a paging or position determination receiver, and can be hand-held, or portable as in vehicle mounted (including cars, trucks, boats, trains, and planes), as desired. However, while wireless communication devices are generally viewed as being mobile, it is also understood that the teachings of the invention are applicable to "fixed" units in some<br>
configurations. In addition, the teachings of the invention are applicable to wireless devices such as one or more data modules or modems which may be used to transfer data and/or voice traffic, and may communicate with other devices using cables or other known wireless links or connections, for example, to transfer information, commands, or audio signals. In addition, commands might be used to cause modems or modules to work in a predetermined coordinated or associated manner to transfer information over multiple communication channels. Wireless communication devices are also sometimes referred to as user terminals, mobile stations, mobile units, subscriber units, mobile radios or radiotelephones, wireless units, or simply as 'users' and 'mobiles' in some communication systems, depending on preference.<br>
[00034]	In the context of wireless devices, the present invention can be used<br>
with wireless devices that uses a variety of industry standards, such as, but not limited to cellular Analog Advanced Mobile Phone System (AMPS), and the following digital cellular systems: Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) spread spectrum systems; Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems; and newer hybrid digital communication systems using both TDMA and CDMA technologies. A CDMA cellular system is described in the Telecommunications Industry Association/Electronic Industries Association (TIA/EIA) Standard IS-95. Combined AMPS &amp; CDMA systems are described in TIA/EIA Standard IS-98. Other communications systems are described in the International Mobile Telecommunications System 2000/Universal Mobile Telecommunications System or IMT-2000/UM standards, covering what are commonly referred to as wideband CDMA (WCDMA), cdma2000 (such as cdma2000 Ix-rxtt cdma2000 Ix, 3x, or MC standards, for example) or TD-SCDMA. Satellite based communication systems also utilize these or similar known standards.<br>
[00035]	In other embodiments, link controllers 140 and 170 can both be a USB<br>
link controller or they both can include a combination of controllers, such as for example, an MDDI link controller and another type of link controller, such<br>
as, for example, a USB link controller. Alternatively, link controllers 140 and 170 can include a combination of controllers, such as an MDDI link controller and a single link for exchanging acknowledgement messages between digital data interface device 100 and digital device 150. Link controllers 140 and 170 additionally can support other types of interfaces, such as an Ethernet or RS~ 232 serial port interface. Additional interfaces can be supported as will be known by individuals skilled in the relevant arts based on the teachings herein.<br>
[00036]	Within digital data interface device 100, message interpreter module<br>
110 receives commands from and generates response messages through communication link 105 to system controller 160, interprets the command messages, and routes the information content of the commands to an appropriate module within digital data interface device 100.<br>
[00037]	Content module 120 receives data from peripheral device 180, stores<br>
the data and transfers the data to system controller 160 through communication link 105.<br>
[00038]	Control module 130 receives information from message interpreter<br>
130, and routes information to control blocks 190 of peripheral device 180. Control module 130 can also receive information from control blocks 190 and routes the information to the message interpreter module 110.<br>
[00039]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a cellular telephone 200 having upper and<br>
lower clamshell sections that uses an MDDI interface to provide high speed data communications between components located in the upper and lower clamshells. The following discussion related to cellular telephone 200 provides an illustrative example that further shows the utility of digital data interface device 100 and provides additional details related to its implementation and use. Based on the discussions herein, use of a digital data interface device 100 with other devices, for example, a personal digital assistant and other types of mobile phones, will be apparent and are within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
[00040]	Referring to FIG. 2, a lower clamshell section 202 of cellular telephone<br>
200 includes a Mobile Station Modem (MSM) baseband chip 204. MSM 204<br>
ls a digital baseband controller. The invention is not limited to use with MSM baseband chip 504. In other embodiments, MSM baseband chip 504 could be another type of baseband processor, programmable digital signal processors (DSPs), or controllers. An upper clamshell section 214 of cellular telephone 200 includes a Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) module 216 and a camera module 218. Both lower clamshell section 202 and upper clamshell section 214 are typically encased in plastic or other protective material, as is typically used with cellular phones, for example. Hinges 250 and 252 mechanically connect lower clamshell 202 to upper clamshell 214. Flexible coupling 254 provides electrical coupling between lower clamshell 202 and upper clamshell 214.<br>
[00041J	MDDI link 210 connects camera module 218 to MSM 204. hi an<br>
embodiment, a MDDI link controller is provided for each of camera module 218 and MSM 204. Within cellular telephone 200, for example, an MDDI Host 222 is integrated into interface system 230 which is coupled to camera module 212, while an MDDI Client 206 resides on the MSM side of the MDDI link 210. hi an embodiment, the MDDI host is the master controller of the MDDI link.<br>
[00042]	In cellular telephone 200, pixel data from camera module 218 are<br>
received and formatted into MDDI packets by interface system 230 using MDDI Host 222 before being transmitted onto MDDI link 210. MDDI client 206 receives the MDDI packets and re-converts them into pixel data of the same format as generated by camera module 218. The pixel data are then sent to an appropriate block in MSM 204 for processing.<br>
[00043]	Similarly, MDDI link 212 connects LCD module 216 to MSM 204.<br>
MDDI link 212 interconnects an MDDI Host 208, integrated into MSM 204, and an MDDI Client 220 integrated into interface system 232 which is coupled to LCD module 216. Display data generated by a graphics controller of MSM 204 are received and formatted into MDDI packets by MDDI Host 208 before being transmitted onto MDDI link 212. MDDI client 220 receives the MDDI<br>
packets and re-converts them into display data and processes the display data through interface system 232 for use by LCD module 216.<br>
[00044]	Interface systems 230 and 232 represent different embodiments of<br>
digital data device interface 100. In the case of interface system 230, digital data device interface 100 elements will be implemented to support data transfer of camera images and camera control functions for a camera. In the case of interface system 232, digital data device interface 100 elements will be implemented to support data display to an LCD and control functions for the LCD. Interface system 230 is further explained to illustrate an embodiment of digital data device interface 100 when used in a cellular telephone with a camera, such as cellular telephone 200 with camera module 218.<br>
[00045]	The relationship between the devices in FIG. 1 and cellular telephone<br>
200 is as follows. Digital data device interface 100 is represented by interface system 230. Link controller 140 is represented by MDDI Host 222. Peripheral 180 is represented by camera module 218. System controller 160 is represented by MSM 204 and link controller 170 is represented by MDDI client 206.<br>
100046]	FIG. 3 is a diagram of upper clamshell 214 and provides further details<br>
related to interface system 230 to highlight the example embodiment of digital data device interface 100 as used within a cellular telephone with a camera. Interface system 230 includes MDDI host 222, camera message interpreter 302, camera video interface 304, I2C master 303, motor control 308 and flash/white LED timer 310. The I2C bus is a commonly used control bus that provides a communication link between circuits. The I2C bus was developed by Philips Electronics N.V. in the 1980s.<br>
[00047]	Recall that interface system 230 corresponds to digital data device<br>
interface 100. The components of interface system 230 correspond to the components of digital data device interface 100 in the following manner. Camera message interpreter 302 corresponds to message interpreter module 100. Camera video interface 304 corresponds to content module 120.<br>
Collectively, I2C master 303, motor control 308 and flash/white LED timer 310 correspond to control module 130.<br>
[00048]	Camera message interpreter 302 receives commands and generates<br>
response messages through MDDI host 222 to MSM 204. Camera message interpreter 302 interprets the messages and routes the information content to the appropriate block within interface system 230, which can be referred to as an MDDI camera interface device. Camera video interface 304 receives image data from camera 320, stores the image data, and transfers the image data to MDDI host 222. Collectively, I2C master 306, motor control 308 and flash/white LED tinier 310 form a camera control block, hi this case I2C master 306 provide controls for managing camera 320, motor control 308 provides controls for managing lens 322 (e.g., lens zoom functions), and flash/white LED timer 310 provides controls for managing flash/white LED 324 (e.g., flash brightness and duration.)<br>
[00049]	FIG. 4 is a diagiam of MDDI Host 222. MDDI Host 222 includes<br>
microprocessor interface 410, command processor 420, registers 430, Direct Memory Access (DMA) interface 440, MDDI packet builder 450, data handshake module 460 and data pad 470. Microprocessor interface 410 interfaces with a bus to a host processor that controls MDDI host 222. The host processor uses microprocessor interface 410 to set registers, read registers and issue commands to MDDI host 222. Microprocessor interface 410 looks at address values and passes the data off to the appropriate module within MDDI host 222, including the passing of writes to command processor 420 and reads and writes to registers values within registers 430.<br>
[00050]	Command processor 420 processes commands received from the host<br>
processor. The commands include powering down MDDI link 210, powering MDDI link 210 up, resetting MDDI host 222, and generating certain types of data packets.<br>
100051]	Registers 430 store registers for the transmission of data across MDDI<br>
link 210. The registers within registers 430 control the behavior of MDDI link 222, as well as the configuration of MDDI host 222.<br>
 [00052]	DMA interface 440 provides burst requests to external memory to<br>
receive information from interface system 230 to buffer data for MDDI packet builder 450. DMA interface 440 parses data of link list node headers and adjusts pointers to read the actual packet data. DMA interface 440 presents the information about the n^xt data packet to send out to MDDI packet builder 450.<br>
[00053]	MDDI packet builder 450 makes decisions about what packet to send<br>
next as well as building the physical packets that will need to go over MDDI link 222. The packets are built from internal registers, counters, and data retrieved by DMA interface 440. When data is to be output over MDDI link 222, output data can be generated from several sources. The first source of packets are control type packets that are generated internally to MDDI packet builder 450. Example packets include sub-frame header packets, fill packets and link shutdown packets. Another source of packets is through DMA interface 440. Thsse packets include packets passed via linked lists. In other embodiments video data, when the peripherals include a video camera, can be passed directly to MDDI packet builder 450. Regardless of the source of the packets, all packets are processed through a CRC generator system that resides within MDDI packet builder 450.<br>
[00054]	Data handshake module 460 manages the physical MDDI link 210.<br>
This is accomplished with a state machine that is responsible for the handshaking process, data output, round trip delay measurements and reverse data. Data handshake module 460 receives data from MDDI packet builder 450 and pass the data out to data pad 470, which shifts the data out onto MDDI hnk 222.<br>
J00055]	Digital data interface 100 constructs packets having digital data<br>
interface device message format as shown in FIG. 5. Digital data interface device message format 500 can be used, for example, to format messages that exchange information and commands between digital data interface device 100 and digital device 150. Message format 500 includes a transaction identifier field 510, a count field 520, a command identification field 530, a<br>
status field 540, and a data field 550. In one example, transaction identifier field 510, count field 520, command identification field 530, and status field 540 are each one byte. Data field 550 is an optional field that may or may not be present. When present data field 550 is either four or eight bytes. In other examples the field sizes can be other lengths, depending on specific messaging needs. The field size uses an 8-bit format for each byte. In other examples, the bit format can include other formats, such as, for example, a 4-bit or 16-bit format.<br>
[00056]	Using the above message formats, command and response messages<br>
can be formatted. There are two types of command messages: a write command and a read command. A write command is a message to execute a command, and a read command is a message to read information from one or more registers. There are three types .of response messages: a write acknowledgment, a read response and an unsolicited message. A write acknowledgment is a response message indicating a successful register access. A read response message contains information that was read from one or more registers. In some instances a read response message can contain status indicators or signals that were not stored in a register. An unsolicited message is generated by, for example, digital data interface device 100 without a request by system controller 160.<br>
[00057]	When communications link 105 is an MDDI link, digital data device<br>
interface messages can be encapsulated within MDDI register access packets. Register access packets are defined within the VESA MDDI standard. When encapsulated within register access packets, the messages are referred to as reversed encapsulated messages.<br>
[00058]	FIG. 6 shows a register access packet format 600. Register access<br>
packet format 600 includes a packet length field 610, a packet type field 620, a client ID field 630, a read/write flag field 640, a register address field 650, a parameter cyclic redundancy check ("CRC") field 660, a register data list field 670 and a register data CRC field 680. With the exception of register address field 650 and register data list field 670, each field is two bytes. Register<br>
address field 650 is four bytes. The register data list field 670 is fourteen bytes. A digital data device interface message conforming to digital data device interface message format 500 can be encapsulated in register data list field 670. The specific uses of the other fields are not germane to the present invention, and are described more fully in the VESA MDDI standard.<br>
[00059)	In general, digital data interface device 100 receives commands from<br>
system controller 160 through MDDI reverse encapsulation packets. The command IDs are embedded in the packet and decoded by message interpreter module 110. The content of the commands is then sent to the appropriate block within digital data interface device 100. Similarly, message interpreter module 110 is also responsible for constructing the response messages to the system controller 160. These messages are either a response to a specific command of system controller 160, such as for example, image data that is to be sent, or an unsolicited message generated by digital data interface device 100 or peripheral device 180.<br>
[00060]	The use of an MDDI message to encapsulate a digital d^ta device<br>
interface message is intended to provide an example of how digital data device interface messages can be encapsulated in other existing message types, and is not intended to limit the invention. Based on the teachings herein, individuals skilled in the relevant arts will be able to determine how to encapsulate digital data interface device messages into other types of messages.<br>
[00061]	In certain situations it is desirable to dynamically adjust the bandwidth<br>
of link 105 from link controller 140 to link controller 170. For example, it may be desirable to adjust the rate of traffic on communications link 105 to minimize latency of control messages from digital device 150 to digital interface device 100, when there is less need to transfer image information from peripheral 180 to digital device 150.<br>
[00062]	For example, when peripheral 180 is a camera and digital device 150 is<br>
MSM 204 as illustrated in FIG. 2 there can be at least three states for the MSM 204, including image preview mode, image capture mode and a hibernation mode, hi image preview mode, a user of cellular phone 200 is<br><br>
previewing an image being photographed. During image preview mode, MDDI host 222 sends fewer pixels from camera module 218 to MSM 204 than when in image capture mode. MSM 204 only needs a subset of pixels in image preview mode to be able to make determinations related to hov, to adjust the auto focus, light balance, exposure and the like.<br>
[00063J	Because the system needs to make very quick adjustments and send the<br>
adjustments back to camera module 218, a short latency time is needed for sending control messages that impact focus, light balance and exposure times, for example. One way to improve latency is for MDDI Host 222 to send fewer pixels, thereby freeing up bandwidth to send control signals from MDDI client 206 to MDDI host 222. The present invention can provide instructions to send fewer pixels. However, in addition, the present invention allows digital data device 150 to dynamically allocate forward and reverse bandwidth across communication link 105 to provide shortened latency periods for commands or data messages in which ensuring a low latency is most important for a particular mode of operation.<br>
[00064]	FIG. 7 illustrates the control blocks for dynamically adapting the<br>
bandwidth across communications link 210. FIG. 7 highlights MDDI client 206 coupled to MDDI host 222 over MDDI link 210. MDDI client 206 includes MDDI packet builder 730 and bandwidth control module 740. Additionally, although not shown in FIG. 7 for ease of illustration, MDDI client 206 will include the same elements as shown in FIG. 4 for MDDI host 222.<br>
[00065]	Bandwidth control module 740 determines the current state of<br>
operation of a device. For example, bandwidth control module 740 determines whether device 200 is in image preview mode, image capture mode or hibernation mode. Based on the determination of the mode, bandwidth control module 740 provides instructions to MDDI packet builder 740 to transmit a packet speed and/or packet size request to the MDDI Host 222.<br><br>
 [00066]	In FIG. 7, only MDDI packet builder 450 and registers 430 are shown<br>
within MDDI host 222 for ease of illustration. Registers 430 include bandwidth registers 710 and 720, which are used to control the data rate for reverse encapsulation data packets and the size of reverse encapsulation data packets that are to be sent from MDDI host 222 to MDDI client 206, respectively. When MDDI host 222 receives a packet speed or packet size request from MDDI client 206, MDDI host 222 stores the packet speed information in bandwidth register 710 and the packet size in bandwidth register 720. MDDI packet builder 460 uses the information stored in bandwidth registers 710 and 720 to determine the size and speed of packets sent to MDDI client 206.<br>
[00067]	FIG. 8 provides a flowchart of method 800 for adjusting the<br>
transmission rate of packets over a transmission link that couples a client device to a host device within an electronic device. Method 800 begins in step 810. In step 810, a change in the state of the electronic device is determined. For example, MDDI Client 206 determines that the state of the device has changed from image capture mode to image preview mode.<br>
[00068]	In step 820, a desired transmission rate is determined. For example,<br>
bandwidth control module 740 can determine the packet speed for packets to be sent from MDDI host 222 to MDDI client 206 over MDDI link 210. The determination of the packet rates and sizes can be based on the system's understanding of the latency requirements for commands within a particular state of the electronic device. Alternatively, a desiied packet size can be determined or a desired packet size and desired transmission rate can be determined.<br>
[00069]	In step 830 the desired transmission rate is transmitted from a client<br>
device to a host device. For example, MDDI client 206 transmits the desired transmission rate to MDDI host 222. Alternatively, MDDI client 206 can transmit a desired transmission rate and/or desired packet size.<br>
[00070]	In step 840, the desired transmission rate is stored. For example,<br>
MDDI host 222 stores the desired transmission rate in bandwidth register 710.<br>
 [00071]	In step 850, the desired transmission rate is accessed. For example,<br>
MDDI packet builder 460 accesses the contents of bandwidth register 710 to determine a desired transmission rate. Alternatively, MDDI packet builder 460 can access the contents of bandwidth register 710 and/or 720 to access a desired transmission rate and packet size.<br>
[00072]	In step 860, data packets are transmitted with the desired transmission<br>
rate. For example, MDDI host 222 transmits reverse encapsulation data packets over MDDI link 210 to MDDI client 206 using the transmission rate obtained from bandwidth register 710. Alternatively, the data packets transmitted can use the transmission rate obtained from bandwidth register 710 and/or can be sized based on the desired packet size contained in bandwidth register 720. In step 870, method 800 ends.<br>
