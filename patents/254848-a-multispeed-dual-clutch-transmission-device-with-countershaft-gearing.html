MULTI-SPEED DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION WITH<br>
COUNTERSHAFT GEARING<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application No. 60/878,318, filed on January 3, 2007. The disclosure of the above<br>
application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present disclosure relates to transmissions, and more<br>
particularly to a multiple speed transmission having a dual clutch assembly and a<br>
countershaft.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a<br>
combination of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve<br>
"power-on" or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the<br>
other, with the synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to<br>
actually making the dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow<br>
from the engine need not be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept<br>
typically uses countershaft gears with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to<br>
achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly, the total number of gears required in<br>
this typical design is two times the number of forward speeds, plus three for reverse.<br>
1<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000449-PTT-DLT<br>
This necessitates a large number of required gear pairs, especially in transmissions<br>
that have a relatively large number of forward speed ratios.<br>
[0004] The addition of clutches, brakes, and gear sets to achieve these<br>
gear ratios and torque ranges may result in inefficient or undesirable transmission<br>
weights and sizes. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a transmission having<br>
improved packaging while providing desirable gear ratios and torque ranges.<br>

DESCRIPTION<br>
[0027] Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer<br>
to like components, in FIG. 1 a multi-speed transmission 10 is depicted. The<br>
transmission 10 includes an input member 12 and an output member 14. In the<br>
present embodiment, the input member 12 and the output member 14 are shafts,<br>
however it should be appreciated that the input and output members 12, 14 may be<br>
components other than shafts. The input shaft 12 is continuously connected with a<br>
torque converter 16 or other starting device. An engine (not shown) is connected to<br>
and provides a driving torque to the torque converter 16. The output shaft 14 is<br>
continuously connected with a final drive unit 18. The final drive unit 18 includes a<br>
final drive unit output shaft 19 that is transverse to input member 12. The<br>
transmission 10 includes a countershaft gearing arrangement 20 that includes<br>
interconnecting shafts, a countershaft, radially aligned or co-planar intermeshing<br>
gear sets and selectively engageable synchronizers as will be described herein. For<br>
example, the countershaft gearing arrangement 20 includes a first interconnecting<br>
shaft 22 and a second interconnecting shaft 24, which is a sleeve shaft concentric<br>
with the first interconnecting shaft 22. The countershaft gearing arrangement 20<br>
further includes a countershaft 26. The countershaft 26 is both spaced from and<br>
parallel with the input shaft 12, the output shaft 14 and the interconnecting shafts 22,<br>
24.<br>
[0028] The first and second interconnecting shafts 22, 24, countershaft<br>
26 and output shaft 14 are supported by a first, second and third support structure or<br>
wall 23, 25, 27 formed in the housing of transmission 10. As conventionally known,<br>
the walls 23, 25, 27 are fitted with bearings 29 for rotatably supporting the first and<br>
7<br><br>

disposed adjacent wall 23 and wall 27 is disposed adjacent wall 25.<br>
[0029] A dual clutch 30 is connected between input shaft 12 and first and<br>
second interconnecting shafts 22, 24 and is located adjacent output shaft 19. The<br>
dual clutch 30 includes a clutch housing 32 connected for common rotation with<br>
input shaft 12. Further, clutch 30 has a first and a second clutch elements or hubs 34<br>
and 36. Clutch elements 34 and 36 together with housing 32 are configured to form<br>
a friction clutch, as well known in the art as a dual clutch. More specifically, clutch<br>
elements 34, 36 and clutch housing 32 have friction plates mounted thereon that<br>
interact to form a friction clutch. Further, clutch element 34 is connected for<br>
common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22 and clutch element 36 is<br>
connected for common rotation with second interconnecting shaft 24. Thus,<br>
selective engagement of clutch element 34 with clutch housing 32 connects the input<br>
shaft 12 for common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22 and selective<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 with clutch housing 32 connects the input shaft 12<br>
for common rotation with second interconnecting shaft 24.<br>
[0030] The countershaft gearing arrangement 20 also includes co-planar,<br>

Attorney Docket No. P000449-PTT-DLT<br>
[0035] Gear set 90 includes co-planar, intermeshing gear 92 and gear 94.<br>
Gear 92 is connected for common rotation with first interconnecting shaft 22. Gear<br>
92 intermeshes with gear 94. Gear 94 is selectively connectable for common<br>
rotation with countershaft 26. As shown in FIG. 1, gear set 90 is disposed adjacent<br>
gear set 80 and provides a second gear ratio.<br>
[0036] Gear set 100 includes co-planar, intermeshing gear 102 and gear<br>

110 is disposed adjacent gear set 100 and wall 27 and provides a fourth gear ratio.<br>
[0038] The transmission 10 further includes a plurality of selectively<br>
engagable synchronizers 111, 113, 115, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124. Synchronizers<br>
111/113, 115/116, 118/120 and 122/124 are a left and right side of synchronizer<br>
assemblies, sharing a common synchronizer hub and sleeve. Synchronizer 111 is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 42 with second interconnecting shaft 24 for<br>
common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 113 is selectively engagable to connect<br>
gear 52 with second interconnecting shaft 24 for common rotation therewith.<br>
Synchronizer 115 is selectively engagable to connect gear 64 with countershaft 26<br>
for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 116 is selectively engagable to<br>
10<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000449-PTT-DLT<br>
connect gear 74 with countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer<br>
118 is selectively engagable to connect gear 84 with countershaft 26 for common<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 120 is selectively engagable to connect gear 94<br>
with countershaft 26 for common rotation therewith. Synchronizer 122 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect gear 102 with first interconnecting shaft 22 for common<br>
rotation therewith. Synchronizer 124 is selectively engagable to connect gear 112<br>
with first interconnecting shaft 22 for common rotation therewith.<br>
[0039] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the<br>
input shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and one<br>
reverse torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is<br>
attained by engagement of dual clutch 30 and one of the clutch elements 34, 36 and<br>
one or more of the synchronizers 111, 113, 115, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124. Those<br>
skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with<br>
each torque ratio.<br>
[0040] To establish the reverse torque ratio clutch element 34 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 118 are engaged. By the engagement of clutch element<br>
34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 through clutch<br>
housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the first interconnecting shaft 22 through gear 82 to idler gear 86. Idler gear 86<br>
transfers the torque to gear 84. Upon engagement of synchronizer 118, gear 84<br>
transfers torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 54.<br>
Gear 54 transfers torque to gear 56, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft<br>
14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
11<br><br>
Attorney Docket No. P000449-PTT-DLT<br>
[0041] A first forward torque ratio (1st gear) is achieved by engaging<br>
clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 116. By the engagement of<br>
clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shall 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the second interconnecting shaft 24. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the second interconnecting shaft 24 to gear 72. Gear 72 transfers<br>
the torque to gear 74. Upon engagement of synchronizer 116, gear 74 transfers<br>
torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 54. Gear 54<br>
transfers torque to gear 56, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14.<br>
Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0042] A subsequent forward torque ratio (2nd gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 120. By the<br>
engagement of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the first interconnecting shaft 22.<br>
Further, torque is transferred from the first interconnecting shaft 22 to gear 92.<br>
Gear 92 transfers the torque to gear 94. Upon engagement of synchronizer 120, gear<br>
94 transfers torque to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear<br>
54. Gear 54 transfers torque to gear 56, which in turn transfers the torque to output<br>
shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0043] A subsequent torque ratio (3rd gear) is established by<br>

contemplates that transfer gears can be driven of off the 1st, 2nd, 6th, and 7th gear<br>
sets based on the desired gear ratios and available packaging envelope in the<br>
transmission case. Finally, an overall transmission length reduction is achieved by,<br>

achievable through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 200.<br>
Moreover, the present invention advantageously provides the transfer gear 286<br>
driven by transfer gear 284. Gear 284 has dual functions: first, it is a driving<br>
transfer gear, and second it is a driven gear (pinion) in the gear set 280. This<br>
arrangement provides flexibility to achieve desired gears ratios and gears steps,<br>

reduction is achieved by, firstly, placing the transfer gears in one plane (two gears<br>
only) and, secondly, providing the reverse idler gear as a single gear (resulting in a<br>
one plane design).<br>
