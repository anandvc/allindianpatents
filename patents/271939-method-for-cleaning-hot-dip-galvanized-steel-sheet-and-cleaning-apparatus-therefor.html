METHOD FOR CLEANING HOT DIP GALVANIZED STEEL SHEET AND CLEANING<br>
APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus<br>
for cleaning a steel sheet which was prepared by hot dip<br>
galvanizing on a strip-shaped steel sheet, and by applying<br>
alloying and temper rolling, further by applying surface<br>
oxidation using an acidic solution, (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"the hot dip galvanized steel sheet").<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
On applying hot dip galvanization to a strip-shaped steel<br>
sheet, the steel sheet which was treated by pickling for descaling,<br>
followed by rolling in a rolling mill to a specified thickness<br>
is annealed in an annealing furnace, and further is transferred<br>
to a molten zinc bath. Figure 3 illustrates the process of common<br>
hot dip galvanizing line on and after the molten zinc bath. The<br>
steel sheet travels in the arrow "a" direction.<br>
For applying hot dip galvanization to a steel sheet la,<br>
the steel sheet la is immersed in a molten zinc bath 2, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3.  Zinc in molten state is held in the molten<br>
zinc bath 2, (hereinafter referred to as "the zinc bath").<br>
During the travel of the steel sheet la in the zinc bath, zinc<br>
adheres to both surfaces of the steel sheet la.<br>
Then, the steel sheet la is sent from the molten zinc bath<br><br>
2 to an alloying furnace 3, where the steel sheet la is subjected<br>
to alloying treatment. The alloying treatment is a heat<br>
treatment to enhance the alloying reaction between the steel base<br>
material of the steel sheet la and the zinc adhered to the steel<br>
sheet la, thus forming a zinc-plating layer having excellent<br>
adhesion.<br>
The steel sheet la after leaving the alloying furnace 3<br>
is cooled in before an interim looper 4 while being adjusted in<br>
the tension thereon, and is further sent to a temper rolling mill<br>
5 to undergo temper rolling (what is called the "skin pass").<br>
The temper rolling is a rolling to apply a light reduction of<br>
about 0.6 to about 3% of reduction in thickness to deform only<br>
in the vicinity of the surface of steel sheet la, thereby<br>
adjusting the surface properties (such as surface roughness) of<br>
the steel sheet la. The reduction in thickness is defined by<br>
the value derived from eq.(1):<br>
Reduction in thickness (%) = 100 x (t1 - t2)/t1<br>
 (1)<br>
where, t1 is the thickness before temper rolling (mm), and t2<br>
is the thickness after temper rolling (mm).<br>
Then, the steel sheet la is fed from the temper rolling<br>
mill 5 to a surface oxidation apparatus 6 to receive surface<br>
oxidation treatment. The surface oxidation treatment is given<br>
to bring both surfaces of the steel sheet la into contact with<br>
an acidic solution, thus to form an oxide film on the surface<br>
of the plating layer. The steel sheet which was treated by the<br><br>
surface oxidation is hereinafter referred to as "the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet lb".<br>
With thus covering the plating layer with the oxide film,<br>
the sliding property of the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb<br>
on working (for example on press-forming) into products having<br>
varieties of shapes is improved. Since, however, the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet lb which is processed from the surface<br>
oxidation apparatus 6 has acidic solution adhered thereto, both<br>
surfaces of the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb are cleaned<br>
in a rinse tank 7 by washing off the acidic solution, and the<br>
hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb is further dried in a drier<br>
8.<br>
The cleaned hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb enters an<br>
outlet looper 9, where the tension thereon is adjusted, and enters<br>
an oiler 10, where a rust-preventive is applied onto the surfaces<br>
thereof, followed by coiling the hot dip galvanized steel sheet<br>
lb by a coiler 11.<br>
As of the conventional hot dip galvanizing line described<br>
above, Figure 4 shows a part-enlarged view ranging from the<br>
surface oxidation apparatus 6 to the rinse tank 7 .  The hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet travels in the arrow "a" direction.<br>
The surface oxidation apparatus 6 brings the surface of<br>
the hot dip galvanizing on the steel sheet la into contact with<br>
the acidic solution. As shown in Fig. 4, for example, acidic<br>
solution spray nozzles 12 to spray the acidic solution 13 are<br>
arranged therein.<br>
The hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb on which the acidic<br>
solution was sprayed in the surface oxidation apparatus 6 is sent<br><br>
to the rinse tank 7.  To assure a period of time necessary to<br>
form the oxide film on the surface of the plating layer at a<br>
sufficient thickness, the distance between the surface oxidation<br>
apparatus 6 and the rinse tank 7 is determined to a specific length.<br>
For example, by controlling the traveling period of time between<br>
the surface oxidation apparatus 6 and the rinse tank 7, the<br>
thickness of the oxide film can reach to 10 nm (nanometer) or<br>
larger.  Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 2002-256448 and<br>
2003-306781 disclose that the covering a plating layer with an<br>
oxide film having 10 nm or larger thickness improves the sliding<br>
property of hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb, thus preventing<br>
damages and peeling of plating layer on working (press-forming<br>
and the like) into products having varieties of shapes.<br>
The rinse tank 7 arranges nozzles therein to spray a<br>
cleaning water 14.  By spraying the cleaning water 14 to the hot<br>
dip galvanized steel sheet lb, the acidic solution adhered to<br>
the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb is removed.  Sole spraying<br>
of the cleaning water 14 is, however, difficult to completely<br>
wash off the acidic solution adhered to the hot dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet lb. Although investigations about the issue are<br>
given including addition of chemicals to the cleaning water 14,<br>
there are left improvement issues in terms of composition and<br>
adding amount of chemicals.<br>
Remained acidic solution on the surface of the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet lb leads to corrosion of the plating layer<br>
by acid, which results in not only the deterioration of appearance<br>
but also the damages and peeling of plating layer, thereby<br>
decreasing the product yield.<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to solve the above<br>
problems and to provide a cleaning method and a cleaning apparatus<br>
to efficiently and fully wash off the acidic solution adhered<br>
to the surface of a hot dip galvanized steel sheet which was<br>
treated by surface oxidation.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for cleaning hot<br>
dip galvanized steel sheet by steps of bringing a strip-shaped<br>
hot dip galvanized steel sheet, treated by surface oxidation in<br>
advance, into contact with a cleaning liquid for 1 second or more,<br>
and then bringing the hot dip galvanized steel sheet into contact<br>

while utilizing the diluted cleaning liquid by recirculating<br>
thereof. In addition, it is more preferable that the contact<br>
of the diluted cleaning liquid is given at a position after a<br>
position of beginning the contact with the cleaning liquid and<br>
at a position before a position of beginning the contact with<br>
the pure water.<br><br>
For any of the above cleaning methods, the cleaning liquid<br>
preferably contains P, and specifically the P concentration in<br>
the cleaning liquid is preferably in a range from 4 to 70 ppm<br>
by mass.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a cross sectional view of an example<br>
of the cleaning apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible that the tank<br>
where the cleaning liquid is sprayed and the tank where the pure<br><br>
water is sprayed are separately installed to conduct cleaning<br>
of a hot dip galvanized steel sheet. The embodiment described<br>
herein adopts an example of illustration in Fig. 1, where the<br>
spray of cleaning liquid and the spray of pure water are given<br>
in a single tank, (hereinafter referred to as "the cleaning tank") .<br>
The hot dip galvanized steel sheet 1b travels in the arrow "a"<br>
direction.<br>
The hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb prepared by hot dip<br>
galvanizing on a strip-shaped steel sheet la, by applying<br>
treatment of alloying and temper rolling, followed by surface<br>
oxidation using an acidic solution is sent to a cleaning tank<br>
15. The cleaning tank 15 has cleaning liquid spray nozzles 16<br>
and pure water spray nozzles 17. The pure water nozzles 17 are<br>
located at a position where the hot dip galvanized steel sheet<br>
travels 1 second or more after being sprayed with the cleaning<br>
liquid. The cleaning liquid spray nozzles 16 spray a cleaning<br>
liquid 18 having cleaning function to both surfaces of the hot<br>
dip galvanized steel sheet lb, and the pure water spray nozzles<br>
17 spray pure water to both surfaces of the hot dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet lb. The pure water in the present invention is<br>
distilled water, ion-exchanged water, industrial clean water,<br>
and the like, which are free from P.<br>
The cleaning tank 15 preferably has an inverting roller<br>
20 which inverts the travel direction of the hot dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet lb. The inverting roller 20 inverts the traveling<br>
direction of the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb, (in the<br>
direction from bottom to top in the cleaning tank 15) , after the<br>
cleaning liquid 18 is sprayed to the hot dip galvanized steel<br><br>
sheet 1b traveling from top to bottom of the cleaning tank 15,<br>
thereby allowing the cleaning liquid 18 at the lowermost position,<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "the inverting bottom end") , to drip<br>
from the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb. Accordingly, the<br>
hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb keeps contact with the cleaning<br>
liquid 18 during a traveling period of from the spray of the<br>
cleaning liquid 18 to the dripping.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferable that<br>
the center axes of the opposing cleaning liquid spray nozzles<br>
16, (hereinafter referred to as "the cleaning liquid spray<br>
position"), are aligned, and that the inverting roller 20 is<br>
located at-a position assuring 1 second or more of the time for<br>
traveling the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb from the cleaning<br>
liquid spray position to the inverting bottom end, thereby<br>
ensuring 1 second or longer time of contacting the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet lb with the cleaning liquid 18.  If the<br>
contact time is 1 second or more, the cleaning effect of the<br>
cleaning liquid 18 is fully attained.<br>
It is preferable that the period of time for the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet lb to travel from the cleaning liquid spray<br>
position to the inverting bottom end, (or the time contacting<br>
with the cleaning liquid 18) , is 10 seconds or less. If the above<br>
time becomes excessively large, a long cleaning tank 15 is<br>
required, and the cleaning liquid 18 dries on the surface of the<br>
hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb to deposit the cleaning liquid<br>
ingredients, which deteriorates the appearance of the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet lb.<br>
By limiting the time of contacting the hot dip galvanized<br><br>
steel sheet 1b with the cleaning liquid 18 to 1 second or more,<br>
preferably from 1.5 to 8 seconds, the concentration of the<br>
cleaning liquid 18 can be decreased, and the acidic solution<br>
adhered to the hot dip galvanized steel sheet 1b can be washed<br>
off.<br>
The kind of the cleaning liquid 18 is not specifically<br>
limited if only it has the cleaning performance.  It is, however,<br>
preferable that the cleaning liquid 18 contains an alkaline<br>
ingredient to neutralize and wash off the acidic solution adhered<br>
to the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb, and specifically<br>
preferred cleaning liquid 18 is the one containing P.  For the<br>
cleaning liquid 18 containing P, a preferable concentration of<br>
P in the cleaning liquid 18 is from 4 to 70 ppm by mass.  If the<br>
P concentration is 4 ppm by mass or more, the acidic solution<br>
adhered to the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb can be fully<br>
washed off.  The P concentration of 70 ppm by mass or less<br>
considerably reduces the remaining amount of the cleaning liquid<br>
ingredients even after the pure water spray 19 described later,<br>
and the appearance of the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb is<br>
not deteriorated.<br>
After the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb is brought<br>
into contact with the cleaning liquid 18, and further drips the<br>
cleaning liquid 18 therefrom at the inverting bottom end, the<br>
hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb is brought into contact with<br>
the pure water 19 to remove the remained cleaning liquid 18.<br>
According to the present invention, although the center<br>
axes of the opposing pure water spray nozzles 17, (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "the pure water spray position"), are aligned,<br><br>
the period of time for traveling the hot dip galvanized steel<br>
sheet 1b from the inverting bottom end to the pure water spray<br>
position is not specifically limited. It is, however,<br>
preferable that the position of the pure water spray is determined<br>
considering that the pure water 18 is sprayed before the cleaning<br>
liquid 18 remained on the hot dip galvanized steel sheet 1b is<br>
dried.<br>
The cleaning liquid 18 and the pure water 19, sprayed to<br>
the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb in the cleaning tank 15<br>
drop onto the bottom of the cleaning tank 15, which are then<br>
successively discharged to enter a separately installed tank,<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "the circulation tank"). That is,<br>
the cleaning liquid 18 and the pure water 19 are not held in the<br>
cleaning tank 15 but are held in the circulation tank as a mixture<br>
of cleaning liquid 18 diluted by pure water 19, (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "the diluted cleaning liquid"). If the diluted<br>
cleaning liquid is subjected to wastewater treatment to remove<br>
toxic substances before discharging, the environment is not<br>
polluted.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors of the present invention<br>
derived a finding that, on washing off the acidic solution adhered<br>
to the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb, the reuse of the diluted<br>
cleaning solution improves the cleaning effect. An example of<br>
the cleaning apparatus is illustrated in Fig. 2. The hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet travels in the arrow "a" direction.<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, as an example, the diluted<br>
cleaning liquid 22 held in the circulation tank 21 is recirculated<br>
by a pump 24 or the like, and is further sprayed on both surfaces<br><br>
of the hot dip galvanized steel sheet 1b at an interim position<br>
 between the position for initiating the contact with the cleaning<br>
liquid and the position for initiating the contact with the pure<br>
water, thus increases the cleaning effect. That is, adding to<br>
the cleaning liquid ingredients existing in the cleaning liquid<br>
18, the low concentration cleaning liquid ingredients existing<br>
in the diluted cleaning liquid 22 are utilized to wash off the<br>
acidic solution adhered to the hot dip galvanized steel sheet<br>
1b. At the cleaning step, the diluted cleaning liquid spray<br>
nozzles 23 spraying the diluted cleaning liquid 22 are arranged<br>
to align their center axes at their opposing positions,<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "the diluted cleaning liquid spray<br>
position").<br>
The diluted cleaning liquid spray position is preferably<br>
located between the position for spraying the cleaning liquid<br>
and the position for spraying the pure water, and specifically<br>
preferable position is between the reverting bottom end and the<br>
pure water spray position because the spray of the diluted<br>
cleaning liquid 22 after dripping the cleaning liquid 18<br>
effectively performs the cleaning effect of the cleaning liquid<br>
ingredients.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb was prepared by<br>
installing the cleaning tank 15 shown in Fig. 1 instead of the<br>
rinse tank 7 in the hot dip galvanization line shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The inverting roller 20 in the cleaning tank 15 was located so<br>
as the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb to take 2.5 seconds of<br><br>
travel from the cleaning liquid spray position to the inverting<br>
bottom end.  The cleaning liquid 18 contained P at a P<br>
concentration of 14 ppm by mass, an injection pressure of 0.15<br>
MPa, and a flow rate of 5 m3/hr.  The pure water 19 was industrial<br>
clean water which was sprayed at a position so as the hot dip<br>
galvanized steel sheet 1b to take 2.5 seconds of travel from the<br>
inverting bottom end to the pure water spray position at an<br>
injection pressure of 0.15 MPa and a flow rate of 10 m3/hr.  The<br>
example was named the Example 1 of the Invention.<br>
The hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb was prepared by<br>
installing the cleaning tank 15 shown in Fig. 2 instead of the<br>
rinse tank 7 in the hot dip galvanization line shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The positions of the inverting roller 20, the cleaning liquid<br>
spray nozzles 16, and the pure water spray nozzles 17 in the<br>
cleaning tank 15, and the conditions for spraying the cleaning<br>
liquid and the pure water were the same to those in the Example<br>
1, so that their descriptions are not given.  The diluted<br>
cleaning liquid 22 was sprayed so as the hot dip galvanized steel<br>
sheet lb to take 2 .1 second of travel from the inverting bottom<br>
end to the diluted cleaning liquid spray position at an injection<br>
pressure of 0.20 MPa and a flow rate of 20 m3/hr.  The example<br>
was named the Example 2 of the Invention.<br>
Conventionally the hot dip galvanized steel sheet lb was<br>
manufactured by using the rinse tank 7 in the hot dip galvanizing<br>
line given in Fig. 3. The rinse tank 7 used industrial clean<br>
water as the cleaning water 14 at an injection pressure of 0.10<br>
MPa and a flow rate of 10 m3/hr. The example was named the<br>
Conventional Example.<br><br>
For each of the Examples 1 and 2 of the Invention and the<br>
Conventional Example, the cleaned state on the hot dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet 1b was determined. The water-wetting rate<br>
calculated from eq.(2) was adopted as an index of the cleaned<br>
state. Higher value of water-wetting rate (%) indicates better<br>
cleaning result.<br>
Water-wetting rate (%) = [Water-wetting surface area<br>
(mm2) ]/[Sample surface area (mm2)] (2)<br>
The water-wetting rate is defined by the following. A<br>
rust preventive (Nox-Rust 550KH, manufactured by Nihon<br>
Parkerizing Co. , Ltd. ) was applied onto a sample, after cleaning,<br>
at a rate of 1900 mg/m2.  The sample was then immersed in a<br>
degreasing liquid (FC-E2011, manufactured by Nihon Parkerizing<br>
Co. , Ltd. ) for 2 minutes.  Further the sample was cleaned by pure<br>
water.  Then, the area rate of the water-wetted portion was<br>
determined by visual observation, which area rate is adopted as<br>
the water-wetting rate.<br>
The observation gave the water-wetting rate of 80% for<br>
the Example 1 of the Invention, 85% for the Example 2 of the<br>
Invention, while giving 70% for the Conventional Example.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present invention allows efficiently and fully<br>
washing off the acidic solution adhered to the surface of the<br>
hot dip galvanized steel sheet after treating by the surface<br>
oxidation, thus the present invention contributes to the<br>
