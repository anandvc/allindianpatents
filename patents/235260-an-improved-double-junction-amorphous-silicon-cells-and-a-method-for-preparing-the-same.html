				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is related to double junction solar photovoltaic cells involving p and n-type layers of amorphous and microcrystaliine hydrogenated silicon and its alloys This invention relates to the use of p-type amorphous and ultra thin n-type microcrystaliine silicon oxide films. This invention also relates to enhancement of short circuit current density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (r\) of the double junction amorphous silicon photovoltaic cells incorporating said thin films, wide band gap semiconductor alloy materials.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A conventional double junction photovoltaic cell includes a front contact such as tin oxide disposed on the substrate followed by two p-i-n junction stacked one above the other, one acts as top cell and another as bottom cell, and a back contact made of, for example, a metal such as aluminum which serves as back reflector of light and as well as collection electrode, In an amorphous silicon alloy p-i-n/p-i-n structured photovoltaic cell, the intrinsic layer is the photovoltaically active layer That is the intrinsic layer is one in which light is absorbed to create carriers that are collected to produce the photo-generated current in the cell. Some of the incident light is absorbed by the n and p-type layers but generates carriers of shorter lifetime and recombines before they can be collected. Hence, absorption in the doped layers does not contribute to the photo-generated current Therefore minimization of absorption in the doped layers enhances the short circuit current and also the fill factor of p-i-n photovoltaic cells In a double junction cell the unabsorbed light by the intrinsic layer of the top cell passes into the bottom cell and absorbed by the bottom intrinsic layer<br><br>
The p-layer of the top cell absorbs the shorter wave length part (390-450 nm) of the visible spectrum. The absorption loss in the p-layer can therefore be adjusted by using wide band gap p-layer.<br>
The i-layer of the top cell that comprises a-Si-H having a thickness ~700Å, for example, has an optical band gap of 1.7 eV and an absorption coefficient which is such that not all the incident light is absorbed in one pass through the thickness of the i-layer.<br>
Thus, the long wavelength light makes passes through the n-layer of the top cell to the bottom cell. Usually ~300Å thick, highly conducting and having low activation energy n-layer have been used. In addition the absorption of this layer should be less for which the optical gap of n-layer should be wide.<br>
The i-layer of the bottom cell is adjusted in order to match the currents of the top and bottom cells.<br>
Details of Prior Art:<br>
The performance including conversion efficiency of double junction a-Si solar cells depends on the quality of the materials, individual thickness of each layer and their interfaces. The conventional double junction a-Si solar cell is shown in figure 1 (a) together with the thickness of each layer. The problems of some of the layers shown in figure 1(a) are given below.<br>
a.	p-a-SiC:H layer: This layer has wide band gap, low electrical conductivity and relative high<br>
activation energy. The a-Si solar cell fabricated with it has good blue response but the fill<br>
factor is lowered by lower electrical conductivity.<br>
b.	n-µc-Si:H layer: This is used at the tunnel junction for improving tunneling and reducing<br>
resistance. The problem is that the minimum thickness required is ~300 Å. This reduces the<br>
intensity of light getting into the bottom cell. The tunneling is also deteriorates.<br>
Objects of the Invention:<br>
The present invention is intended to enhance the short circuit current and the conversion efficiency of a double junction amorphous silicon photo-voltaic cell.<br>
More particularly, the object of this invention is to provide improved double junction amorphous silicon photo-voltaic cell having wide band gap amorphous silicon alloy p-layers to minimize absorption of incident radiation at the window layers and ultra thin highly conducting silicon micro-crystalline n-layer at the tunnel junction to minimize the absorption of radiation while making passes through the n-layer to the bottom cell.<br>
Further, the object is to provide photo-voltaic cells where the ultra thin wide band gap, highly conducting silicon micro-crystalline alloy n-layer has also been used to minimize the optical absorption and hence to increase the short circuit current.<br>

Importantly, the doped hydrogenated micro-crystalline silicon oxide layer (~150Å) is deposited on a layer of undoped hydrogenated micro-crystalline silicon film having thickness ~3oÅ.<br>
It is to be noted that, the opto-electronic properties of the above mentioned material at the required level of thickness i.e. ~180Å for fabrication of the n-layer at the tunnel junction and as the n-layer of the bottom cell, are as follows:<br>
(n-µc-Si:H + seed): Optical gap = 2.00 eV; photo-conductivity = 2.57 Scm-1; activation energy = 0.015 eV;<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
(a) Ultra thin microcrystalline n-layer<br>
Figure 1 © shows one embodiment of the present invention wherein a ultra thin highly conducting n-type microcrystalline layer is formed on the intrinsic layer of the top cell and a wide gap ultra thin highly conducting n-type microcrystalline alloy layer :s formed on the intrinsic layer of the bottom celt The sample has been prepared in one chamber of a multichamber RF-PECVD system (13.56 MHz) with base vacuum -l0-9 Torr. The layer has been deposited by che decomposition of silane (SiR4) gas by using hydrogen (H2) as the diluent and phosphine (PH3) as the dopant. Carbon dioxide (C02) is added to the source gas mixture for providing oxygen, which act as the band gap-widening element The, "Mm has been deposited at a relatively low substrate temperature (200°C) and at a low rf-power density 14 mW/cm2. The chamber pressure was kept fixed at 1.0 Torr.<br>
The thickness of the n-layer was reduced from 300Å (conventional) to 180Å by<br>
using seeding technique with acceptable optoelectronic properties In this technique the doped hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon layer (-150Å) is deposited on a layer of undoped hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon film having thickness ~30Å. In the same way the doped hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon oxidelayer (-150Å) is deposited on<br>
a layer of undoped hydrogenated microcrystalline silicon film having thickness ~30Å.<br>
The optoelectronic properties of the above mentioned material at the required level of<br>
thickness i.e. ~ 180A for fabrication of the n-layer at the tunnel junction and as the n-<br>
layer of the bottom cell, are as follows:<br>
(n-µc-Si:H + seed): Optical gap= 2.00 eV; photoconductivity = 2.57 Scm-1; activation<br>
energy = 0.015 eV;<br>
(n-µc-SiO:H + seed): Optical gap= 2.14 eV; photoconductivity = 1.45 Scm-1; activation<br>
energy = 0.017 eV;<br>
(a) Fabrication of double junction photovoltaic cell<br>
Figure 1© represents the schematic diagram of the present invention. TCO coated glass was taken as a substrate for fabricating the p-l-n structured photovoltaic cell. P-type layer acts as the window layer for the solar spectrum incident on the photovoltaic cell. Wide band gap window layer allows more light to enter into the active layer. In the present invention we have used wide band gap (2.00 eV) p-type amorphous silicon carbide alloy material as the window layer of the top cell and oxide alloy material for the bottom cell. We have introduced an undoped amorphous silicon carbide alloy sandwiched between the window and active layer at the top cell and an undoped amorphous silicon oxide alloy sandwiched between the window and active layer at the bottom cell. These layers acts as the buffer layers for compensating the mismatch in band gap between the wide band gap window and relatively lower band gap intrinsic layer (1.70 eV). The intrinsic layer is highly photosensitive (photo gain ~ 106) and acts as the active layer in which light is absorbed to create carriers that are collected to produce the photo-generated current in the cell. The ultra thin n-layers, discussed earlier, has been deposited on the intrinsic layers.<br>
From the Quantum Efficiency measurement it is observed that the blue and the red response is better due to the use of wide band gap p-type hydrogenated silicon carbide at the top cell and wide band gap p-type hydrogenated silicon oxide film at the bottom cell, respectively. Also the short circuit current improved due to the use of ultra thin (~18nm) n-type microcrystalline hydrogenated silicon at the tunnel junction and ultra thin (~19nm) n-type microcrystalline hydrogenated silicon oxide film as the last layer bottom cell. Below we compare the PV parameters of the present invention (Figure 1©) with the conventional cell structures (Figure l(a)). Figure l(b) has been fabricated having the structure identical to Figure l(a) employing p-a-SiO:H as the window layers instead of p-a-SiC:H films in order to judge the feasibility of the p-a-SiO:H film as the window layers.<br>
The PV parameters of the present invention along with the comparative results of that of the conventional one have been given in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that short circuit current density (Jsc) and conversion efficiency (Η|) of the double junction<br>
have been improved in the present invention compared to that of the conventional one. The ultra thin, highly conducting n-µc-Si:H film deposited by seeding technique favors the long wavelength light making passes through the n-layer more to the bottom cell in the present invention giving rise to the increase in the short circuit current of the photovoltaic cell.<br>
