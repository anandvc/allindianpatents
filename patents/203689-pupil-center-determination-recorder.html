COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
PUPIL CENTER DETERMINATION RECORDER<br>
HOSHINO, RYUICHI of 10-34, TAJIMA 2-CHOME, IKUNO-KU, OSAKA-SHI, OSAKA 544-0011, JAPAN , JAPANESE national<br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br>
PUPIL CENTER DETERMINATION RECORDER<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to a pupil center determination recorder to make agree the optical center of a lens with the pupil center of a spectacled user in making the glasses.<br>
Disclosure of the Prior Art<br>
The major components of glasses are a frame and lenses. A frame is mainly selected in view of its fashionability, while lenses are selected in accordance with user"eyesight. The most important thing in making glasses is to make the optical center of each lens agree with user"s pupil center. The deviation of the optical center form the pupil center exhibits no performance even if the lenses meet the eyesight, resulting in shoulder stiffness or systemic fatigue, in the worst case, pathologic conditions including heterotopias.<br>
The biggest facjtor of the deviation of the optical center from the pupil center in glasses is that the optical center of each lens is adjusted to an average position of the pupil center in spite of the fact that each user has a different face shape, namely the position of the pupil center varies according to users.<br>
As stated in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 8-4781 (No.4781/96)â€ž a device to make the optical center agree with the pupil center has been already proposed. It is designed<br><br><br>
to decide the center of the pupils in a frame by inputting the image of a user wearing the frame for deciding the coordinate of the pupil center.<br>
In this method, however, the measurer determines the<br>
5  coordinates of the pupil center as the pupil center of the user<br>
(subject). Accordingly, in many cases, the position deviates<br>
from the position considered to be the true pupil center by the<br>
subject.<br>
The true pupil center regarded by the subject means the<br>
10 pupil centers of the both eyes when the subject looks at a distant view 2-3 meters away from him and the same marks shown in front of 1?oth eyes are overlapped each other. Thus, the position regarded as the pupil center by the measurer is named an objective pupil center, while the position regarded as, the pupil center by the<br>
15 subject is named a subjective pupil center. Explanation of them are made in the following:<br>
Since about 5-6 mm deviation often exists between the objective pupil center and the subjective pupil center, it is not possible to make glasses on the basis of the subjective pupil<br>
20  center by the method stated in above mentioned official gazette.<br>
Summary of the Invention This invention has been originated from the viewpoint of<br>
the above circumstances.<br>
25       An object of the invention is to provide a pupil center<br><br>
3<br>
determination recorder, which verifies the pupil center by consideration of the objective pupil center and the subjective pupil center to make the pupil center agree with the optical center of lenses. 5 A pupil center determination recorder of the present invention can accomplish the  above objects.<br>
The recorder is comprised a guide main body to be attached<br>
to a frame of glasses worn by a subject, a pair of adjusters<br>
movably attached to the guide main body, and pointers respectively<br>
10  attached to the pair of adjusters, wherein the pointer has a<br>
first marking section for marking the right pupil center and<br>
\ the left pupils center of the subject measured by a measurer<br>
on dummy lenses attached to the frame of the glasses worn by<br>
the subject, a second marking section for displaying identical<br>
15 marks in front of the subject"s right and left pupils and a third marking section for moving the adjusters so as to superimpose the identical marks each other and for marking the right pupil center and the left pupil center on the dummy lenses at a position where the marks appear to be superimposed. The first, .the second,<br>
20 and the third marking sections can move on the same circumference and be fixed at the same position.<br>
According to the invention, it is desirable that the center of the mark shown by the second marking section is transparent one with ring shape.<br>
2,5	The marking by the third marking section is carried out<br><br>
4<br>
by sticking a seal with the same mark as that shown by the second marking section to each dummy lenses.<br>
The invention is designed as described above and therefore exerts the following effects. 5 The third marking section marks the subjective pupil center on each dummy lens simply by verifying the objective pupil center in the first marking section, and by verifying the subjective pupil center in the second marking section. The result determines the pupil center after considering the objective pupil<br>
10 center and the subjective pupil center. The use of the recorder prevents problems, including shoulder stiffness, systemic fatigue, caused by disagreement between the optical center and the pupil center observed in conventional lenses. Easy adjustment of glasses having disagreement between the optical center and<br>
15 the pupil center is possible, which contributes to elimination of the above problems.<br>
The center part of the mark exhibited by the second marking section is of a transparent ring-shape, accordingly easy verification for the subjective pupil center is allowed.<br>
20 The marking done by the third marking section readily allows repeated marking by sticking the seal having the same mark as that exhibited by the second marking section to each dummy lens, verifying the pupil center more exactly.<br>
Other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the<br>
25  invention will become more apparent from, the following detailed<br><br>

The recorder for verifying the pupil center embodying the present invention comprises a guide main body 100 attached to the frame 900 of glasses worn by a subject P1 to be inspected, a pair of adjusters 200 movably attached to the guide main body<br>
10 100, and pointers 300 attached to the pair of adjusters 200. The pointer 300 has a first marking section 340A for marking the respective pupil centers (the objective pupil qenter El) of right and left pupils E of the subject PI observed by an observer P2 on dummy lenses 920 attached to the frame 900 of the subject"s<br>
15 glasses, a second marking section 340B showing the same mark 342B in front of the right and left pupils E of the subject PI, and a third marking section 340C for moving the adjuster 200 to superimpose the same marks 342B and for carrying out marking exhibiting the respective pupil centers (subjective pupil center<br>
20 E2) of the right and left pupils E on the associated dummy lenses 920. The first, the second, and the third marking section 340A, 340B 340C respectively, move on the same circumference to fix at the same position.<br>
The guide main body 100 has a pair of clamp sections 110<br>
25  to be attached to the frame 900 of the glasses. Each clamp section<br><br>
8<br>
110 has been designed to vertically hold a rim 910 of a frame<br>
900.<br>
Each clamp section 110 has a clamp side shaft 111 having<br>
a stationary part 111A at its lower end and a clamp side shaft 5  fixing section 112 for fixing the clamp section 110 to the rim<br>
910 with the clamp side shaft 111 penetrating through the clamp<br>
side shaft fixing section 112. Each camp side shaft fixing section<br>
112 has a blocked clamp side mobile part 112A having an opened<br>
through hole 112a into which the clamp side shaft 111 penetrates 10  and a screw section 112b screwed in the clamp side mobile part<br>
112A with its extremity reaching the through hole 112a. The clamp<br>
side mobile part 112A at its lower end had a downward upper side<br>
claw section 112c<br>
The stationary part 11,1 A has an upward lower side clamp 15  claw section 111c at its upper end. The stationary part 111A<br>
is provided with a screw part 111b for moving the lower side<br>
claw section 111c.<br>
The frame rim 910 and also the frame 900 are fixed to each<br>
lens by grasping the rim 910 with both claw section 111c and 20  112c, by moving the clamp side mobile part 112A along the clamp<br>
side shaft 111, and then by fixing the clamp side shaft 111 through<br>
the use of the screw section 112b.<br>
A pair of aright and a left clamp section 110 are connected<br>
to each other through a main shaft 120. h  rack 121 is formed 25  on the top surface of the main shaft 120(See FIG. 3). The rack<br><br>
9<br>
121 is used for moving the adjusters 200 in the right and the left directions.<br>
In this way the guide main body 100 is roughly composed of a pair of clamp sections 110 and the main shaft 120 f or connecting the pair of clamp sections 110 to each other like a gate shape.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, each adjuster 200 has a blocked adjuster side mobile part 210 having a horisontally penetrated horizontal though hole 211 and a vertically penetrated vertical through hole 212, a horizontal pinion section 220 rotationally movably attached to the adjuster side snobile part 210 with Its tooth section being exposed to the horizontal through hole 211, a vertical pinion section 230 with its tooth section being exposed to the vertical through hole 212 and an adjuster side shaft 240 inserted in the vertical through hole ,212.<br>
The man shaft 120 is penetrated through horizontal through hole 211 of the adjuster side mobile pax-t 210 to engage the tooth<br>
section of the horizontal pinion section 220 with the rack 121<br>
of the main shaft 120. Rotationally moving the horizontal pinion section 220 moves the adjuster side mobile part 210 in the transverse direction, the right and the left directions, along the main shaft 120.<br>
A rack 241 is formed on the adjuster side shaft 240. The rack 241 is engaged with the tooth section of the vert.ica3. pinion section 230. The rotationally moving the vertical pinion section 230 moves the adjuster side shaft 240 in the vertical direction<br><br>
10<br>
upward and downward.<br>
Each pointer 300 has a generally ring-shaped frame section<br>
310	provided on the adjuster side shaft 240 at its extremity,<br>
a hub section 320 rotationally movably engaged with the interior<br>
5 of the frame section 310, outwardly projecting three arms 330A, 330B, 330C provided on the hub section 320 and outwardly projected with the hub section 320 being engaged with the frame section 310, and a first marking section 340A, a Second marking section 340B and a third marking section 340C provided on the arm sections 10  330A, 330B, 333C at their extremities, respectively.<br>
An interior of the frame section 310 has small balls<br>
311	inwardly elastically energized by internal springs<br>
respectively. Three recesses (not shown in a drawing) are formed at 45 degree-intervals in the outer periphery of each arm section<br>
15 330A-, 330B-, 330C-free side of the hub section 320. Engaging the small balls 311 with recesses, respectively anchors the rotationally moving position of the hub section 320 in the frame section 310.<br>
The hub section 320 has portions protruded from the frame<br>
20 section 310 even if the hub section 320 is engaged with the frame section 310. The three arm sections 330A, 330B, 330C are protruded and formed at 45 degree-intervals at the portions. The three arm sections 330A, 330B, 330C are equal in length. The hub section 320 is provided with a knob 321 held with a hand in rotationally<br>
25  moving the hub section 320.<br><br>
11<br>
Of the three arm sections 330A, 330B, 330C, the uppermost arm section 330A at its extremity is provided with the first<br>
J	â– <br>
parking section 340. The first marking section 340A xs of a ring<br>
shape having an opening 341A, of such a size that an measurer<br>
5  P2 may verify the pupil center (objective pupil center El) of<br>
each pupil E of the subject PI.<br>
Of the three arm sections 330A, 330B, 330C, the central<br>
arm section 330B at its extremity is provided with the section<br>
marking section 340B. The second marking section 340B is of a<br>
10  generally ring shape and has an opening 341B with the same size<br>
as that of the first marking section 340A. The opening 341B is<br>
\	.        â–     _<br>
provided with a mark 342B having a transparent center and an<br>
orange ring-like periphery.<br>
Of the three arm sections. 330A, 330B, 330C, the lowermost<br>
15 arm section 330C at its extremity is provided with the third marking section 340C. As shown in FIG. 5, the third marking section 340C has a seal 342C having the same pattern, namely a transparent center and an orange periphery, as those of the mark 342B. The seal 342C has a printed crisscross reticule 342D serving as a<br>
20  guide to verify the subjective pupil center E2.<br>
As mentioned above, the three arm sections, 330A, 330B, 330C are equal in length and are formed at 45-degree intervals like the three recesses in the frame section 310. Thus, rotationally moving the hub section 320 results in movement on<br>
25  the same circumference and fixing at the same position.<br><br>
12<br>
Now, explanation is made to work for verifying the pupil center by the use of the recorder having the above configuration. Firstly, the frame 900 of the glasses selected by the subject PI is attached to the guide main body 100 of the recorder. 5 Namely, the frame 900 is clamped by the use of the clamp section 110. Upwardly and downwardly holding the rim 910 of the frame 900 with the aid of the upper side claw section 112c and the lower side claw section 111c of the clamp section 110 fixes the frame 900 to the guide main body 100. Each dummy lens 920 is<br>
10  previously attached to the rims 910 of the frame 900.<br>
Secondary, as shown FIG. 9, the subject PI wears the frame 900 on which the recorder is anchored through the guide main 3ody 100. It is important to wear the frame 900 at the same position as that used for ordinary spectacle application.<br>
15 As shown in FIG.6, rotationally moving the hub section 320 of the pointer 300 provides horizontality to the arm section 330A having the first marking section 340A. As shown in FIG. 10(A), horizontally vertically adjusting thee adjuster 200 in four directions makes the first marking section 340A observed<br>
20 from the measurer P2 side agree with the pupil center El (objective pupil center) of each pupil E. Marking M in white ink is applied to each dummy lens 910 through the opening 341A of the first marking section 340A. The marking M is applied to the right and the left pupils.<br>
25        Finally as shown in FIG.7, rotationally moving the hub<br><br>
13<br>
section 320 of the pointer 300 provided horizontality to the arm section 330B having the second marking section 340B. The first marking section 340A and the second marking section 340B are designed to move on the same circumference, being fixed at 5 the same position. This makes the opening 34IB of the second marking section 340A agree with the opening 341A of the first marking section 340A in their positions. Consequently, the opening 341B of the second marking section 340B agrees with the marking in white ink. 10 The subject PI looks at a distant view, 2-3 meters or longer in this state. Agreeing the objective pupil center El with the<br>
"t<br>
subjective pupil center E2 must naturally superimpose the marks 342B provided to apair of secondmarking section 340B respectively. The absence of the superimposed marks 342B encourages the two<br>
15 adjusters 200 horizontally vertically move in four directions for superimposition of the marks 342B. The position where the marks 342B are superimposed is the subjective pupil center E2. (See FIG. 19(B)).<br>
The adjuster section 200 is fixed at the position where<br>
20 marks 342 are superimposed. In this state, the second marking section 340B is replaced with the third marking section340C. (See FIG. 8). As shown in FIG. 10(C), seal 342C provided on the third marking section 340C is stuck to the right and the left dummy lenses 920 respectively. The seal 342C-stuck position is<br>
25  the subjective pupil center E2.<br><br>
14<br>
Measurement is applied to a coordinate (the coordinate of the subjective pupil center E2) at the rim 910 of the frame 900 at the transparent center of the seal 342C stuck to each dummy lens 920. The measurement accepts conventional charts. 5 The resulting coordinate data is fed to lens -finishing equipment. The lens is finished in such a manner that the finished lens may have the optical center made agree with the coordinate. The optical center of the lens in such a way surely agrees with the subjective pupil center E2 of the subject PI. 10 ] The embodiment mentioned above is applied to the frame of the lens. Application is also possible to a contact lens and to measurement for a squint.<br>
A bifocal lens has and optical center for a distant view and, an optical center for a near view. The use of the recorder 15  permit easy agreement of both optical centers and the respective pupil centers.<br>
Explanation is made on the application of the recorder to an automatic refract meter AR.<br>
The automatic refract meter AR automatically detects the 20 refractive index and the objective pupil center of each pupil E of the subject PI by Irradiating each pupil E of the subject PI with an infrared beam and then by detecting its reflection. The automatic refract meter AR has a stand ARl on which the jaw of the subject PI is placed, a moving mechanism (not shown in 25  a drawing) for horizontally and vertically moving the stand ARl<br><br>
15<br>
in four directions, an irradiation section (not shown in a drawing) for irradiating each pupil E of the subject P1 with the infrared beam, an arithmetic section (not shown in a drawing) for computing the refractive index of each pupil E with the aid of the infrared 5 beam reflected from each pupil E, an image pick-up section AR2 for picking up the image of the pupil E of the subject PI, with the jaw of the subject PI placed on the stand AR1 and a display section (not shown in a drawing), including a CRT for displaying each pupil E imaged by means of the image pick-up section AR2.<br>
10 The recorder is installed on the automatic refract meter AR. As shown in FIG.11, the seal 342C has been designed to be stuck to each dummy lens 920 attached to the fame 990 of the user"s glasses. The casing of the automatic refract meter AR at its upper part has a rod section 800" capable of advancing/<br>
15 retreating to/from each dummy lens 920, a seal sticking section 810 provided at the extremity of the arm section 800, and a seal 342C attached to the seal sticking section 810.<br>
When the objective pupil center El is verified by means of the automatic refract meter AR, the stand AR1 is then fixed<br>
20 to the jaw of the subject PI. The rod section 800 is pressed against the subject PI. Finally, the seal 342C attached to the seal sticking section 810 is stuck to a dummy lens 920. The above are applied to the right and the left pupils E.<br>
In this state, the jaw of the subject PI is removed from<br>
25  the stand AR1. Verification is made to assure that the seals<br><br>
16<br>
342C stuck to the right and the left dummy lenses 920 are superimposed. When the result is positive, each objective pupil center El agrees with each subjective pupil center E2. The measurement for measuring the coordinate (the coordinate of the 5 subjective pupil center E2) in the rim 910 of the frame 900 at the center thereof in the transparent seal 342C area is available by the user of a conventional chart. The resulting coordinate data is fed to the lens-finishing equipment to finish each lens in such a manner that the optical center of the finished lens<br>
10  may agree with the coordinate.<br>
The negative result means disagreement between the objective pupil center El and the subjective pupil center E2. Where, the adjuster 200 is moved in the right and the left direction to make tho subjective pupil contor E2 agree with the objective<br>
15 pupil center El. The work after verifying the agreement of the subjective pupil center E2 is the same as the work mentioned above.<br>
The application of the recorder to the automatic refract meter AR enables exact and prompt agreement of the objective<br>
20 pupil center El and the subjective pupil center E2. The same is true for the verification of the subjective pupil center E2.<br><br>
