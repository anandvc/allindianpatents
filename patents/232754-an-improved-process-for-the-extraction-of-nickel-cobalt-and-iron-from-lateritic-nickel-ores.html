				<td>An improved process for the extraction of nickel, cobalt and iron from laterite nickel ores.<br>
Lateritic nickel ore contains primarily nickel, cobalt iron and chromium. The present invention will separate the iron, nickel and cobalt components in directly usable forms.<br>
Iron will be available as iron (III) sulphate as solution or hydroxide/oxide form Ferric sulphate may be used as a starting material for making electrolytic iron powder, ferrites and several other value added iron compounds, namely, ferric oxalate, ferric stearate etc.<br>
Nickel will be obtained as hydroxides. This may conveniently be used for making either nickel metal or nickel sulfate.<br>
Cobalt will be obtained as cobalt (III) hydroxides. This may conveniently be used for making cobalt metal or cobalt sulfate.<br>
The first commercial process for the extraction of nickel from lateritic nickel ore was commissioned by the Freeport Sulfur Company. They had access to a huge reserve of iateritic nickel ore containing 
Though initial exploits of Freeport Sulfur did not succeed to the extent it was desired to be, they same up with a better process in 1957. lateritic nickel ore containing nickel 
Moa Bay Process has several advantages but the primary constraint is that it is an energy intensive process. Moa Bay project in Cuba was abandoned in 1959 even before the plant was actually operative.<br>
Falconbridge process is relatively recent where lateritic nickel ore is directly used for making ferro-nickel through reduction roasting followed by electric furnace smelting.<br>
Falcon bridge process enjoys certain advantages in its concept as well as regarding the direct relevance of its end product. However, the process is energy intensive.<br>
Given below are some of the important processes for the extraction of nickel from lateritic ores. However most of them have not yet been commercially exploited. In patent No.<br><br>
US4125588, 1977 a method has been given for the recovery of nickel and magnesia from laterites using low temperature sulfation.<br>
In patent No. US 41959865. 1978, a process has been described for the selective reduction of nickel lateritic ores for the extraction of non-ferrous metals.<br>
In patent No. US4301125, 1977, a method has been given for the extraction of Ni from pre-reduced lateritic ores with aqueous sulfuric aid in the presence of peroxidants.<br>
In Patent No. US4311520, a process has been given for the recovery of nickel, cobalt and manganese from their oxides and silicates.<br>
In Patent No. GB 2086872A, 181, acid leaching of lateritic nickel ores have been described.<br>
Acid leaching of nickel from serpentinic laterite ores have been described in patent no. US4410498. 1980.<br>
A method of liberating nickel and cobalt from laterites using high presence acid leaching has been given in patent Nos. US4541994, 1983 and US4541868, 1983, US4548794 1983.<br>
Existing processes are generally energy intensive processes.<br>
Existing processes generate huge quantity of residues and wastes which are not environment friendly and cause serious disposal problems.<br>
Existing processes are not operator friendly and involves toxic reagents like hydrogen sulfide, carbon monoxide etc.<br>
Lateritic nickel ores, especially those of Indian origin, are by nature lean ores. Available processes mostly deal with ores in which nickel content is more than 1%. India has a huge reserve of lateritic nickel ores. But unfortunately, the average nickel concentration in that lies between 0.4-0.6%. Presently, there is no available method to process nickel ores of such a low grade.<br>
Therefore R&amp;D efforts have been made to develop an improved process for the extraction of nickel, cobalt and iron from lateritic nickel ores.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the extraction of nickel, cobalt and iron separately from the lateritic nickel ore.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the extraction of nickel, cobalt and iron from lateritic nickel ore containing nickel 0.1% and above.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the extraction of nickel, cobalt and iron from lateritic nickel ore in an eco friendly way, thereby reducing environment pollution and operational hazards.<br><br>
The metal components of the raw ore are taken in the solution by atmospheric acid leaching using mineral acids and traces of organic acids, lateritic nickel ores are basically oxides of iron where Ni is embedded in the Goethite structure. Under reducing conditions, the dissolution is better through prior to that opening of the matrix is necessary HNO3 and H2SO4 helps in opening up the matrix. Presence of H2S04 causes sulfation and supplies energy for that by reacting with water.<br>
The leach liquor contains sulfate, chloride and nitrate solutions of nickel, iron, cobalt an dother soluble metals, Iron is separated as hydroxide at pH 2.7 using suitable precipitants. Nickel and cobalt remain in the solution. The reactions that take place are,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
To the solution containing nickel and cobalt, a strong oxidising is an PH of the solution is raised in the range of 3-4. The solution is allowed to settle for some time after which the PH of the solution is slowly lowered below 0.7 by drop wise addition of an oxidising acid. The solution is further allowed to settle for some time and the PH of the solution is again raised to 3 by the addition of an appropriate neutralising agent. Co(II) is oxidised to CO(III) and precipitated as Co(III) hydroxide. A part of the nickel along sets oxidised to its higher oxidation states and converted to their hydroxides oxide out they are brought back to the solution by the addition of oxidising acid. Co(III) hydroxide is filtered and separated. The solution contains only nickel. The reactions that take place are<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
To the nickel solution, Na2C03 is added followed by a few pellets of NaOH till the PH is in the range of 8-10 Nickel hydroxide is precipitated out. The reactions that take place are .<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides improved process for the extraction of nickel, cobalt and iron from the lateritic nickel ores which comprises:<br>
(a)        leaching lateritic nickel are with mineral acid and traces of organic acid followed by filtration;<br><br>
(b)	heating the filtrate obtained in step (a) to boiling, adding neutralizing agent to the boiling<br>
filtrate to separate iron as precipitate;<br>
(c)	adding strong oxidizing agent to the filtrate obtained in step (b) to raise the pH of the<br>
filtrate in the range of 3 to 4, adding oxidizing acids to lower the pH below 0.7, followed<br>
by addition of neutralizing agent to the mixture to raise the pH in the range of 2.7 - 3,<br>
filtering the resultant mixture to separate cobalt as precipitate;<br>
(d)	adding neutralizing agent to the filtrate obtained in step (c) till the pH is in the range of 8<br>
to 10 followed by filtration to obtain nickel as precipitate.<br>
