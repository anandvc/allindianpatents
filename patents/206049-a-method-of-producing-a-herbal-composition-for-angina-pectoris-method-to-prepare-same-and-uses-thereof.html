GRANTED<br>
26/5/2005<br><br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of International | Patent Application No. PCT/USOl/49396, filed December 18, 2001 which claims benefit of U.S. Serial No. 60/258,0.57, filed 22 December 2000, the content of which are incorporated here into this application.<br>
Throughout this application, various publications are referenced and the disclosures of these publications are hereby incorporated by reference into this application in order to more fully describe the state of the art as known to the skilled therein as of the date of the invention described and claimed herein.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chronic stable angina pectoris is due to transit myocardial ischemia. Aspirin, nitrates, beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, and calcium channel blocking drugs used alone or in combination with one another are the commonly used drugs for angina pectoris.<br>
Aspirin as an antithrombotic agent is a symptomatic treatment for chronic stable angina pectoris.  <br>
Nitrates are used to treat , an anginal episode and can be successfully used in prophylaxis by patients with predictable symptoms. With all nitrates, troublesome headache can prevent their use in certain susceptible individuals.<br>
Beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs, although established as a cornerstone in the treatment of angina, are specifically contraindicated in patients with obstructive airways diseases and severe ventricular dysfunction, and relatively contraindicated in diabetes and in those with peripheral vascular disease, bradycardia or heart block.<br>
Calcium antagonists are certainly effective in angina, achieving<br>
2<br><br><br>
their effects by smooth muscle relaxation in the coronary arteries and peripheral circulation, increasing myocardial supply and reducing myocardial work.<br>
Although there is progress in drug combination therapy in angina, which most patients begin treatment with nitrates and a beta-adrenoceptor blocking drug or a calcium antagonist, there is a need of drug for chronic stable angina pectoris which is very effective, can be taken for a long period of time and has very low toxicity.<br>
In view of the problems of relating to the above mentioned drugs, notable efforts have been made to apply herbal Medicine as an alternative to the standard treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris . Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has contributed much in this respect.<br>
US Pat. No. 5288485 and 5433957 refer to an extract from hypericum erectum thunb  for curing or preventing diseases caused by disorder<br>
in blood circulation such as angina pectoris.<br>
US Pat. Mo. 577 64 63 refers to an oral pharmaceutical composition containing petals of borage or extract of borage petals for the prevention and treatment of stress which is associated with circulatory heart, diseases including angina.<br>
In addition to hypericum erectum  thunb  and borage petals,  many<br>
other herbal plants have also been used to treat angina. One such<br>
plant is Vaieriana officinalis latifolia.   Yang GY et al (1994)<br>
Reported that 82 patients with angina pectoris had been treated<br>
with Valeriana  officinalis latifolia,   among whom ST-T ischemic<br>
changes appeared on ECG in 50 cases before treatment. Its total<br>
effective rate for simple angina (without detectable ischemic<br>
findings) was 87 . 80%; the angina with ischemic findings, 88.00%.<br>
In   a-dditionr    it »as   discovered    that    Valeriana-   officinalis<br>
latifolia   could lower plasma lipids as well. No toxic actions<br>
to liver, kidney, and hemopoietic tissue, have been found. (1)<br>
3<br><br>
Wu Y (1990) reported that in a setting of 267 patients with angina pectoris, 93.3% of the patients treated with xintongkang capsule was effective.<br>
Another herbal preparation called Shenshao tongguanpian was used in treating angina pectoris. In 1990, Hu JX et al. Reported that the Shenshao tongguan plan is composed chiefly of saponin from the stem and leaves of Ginseng and Radix Paeoniae Alba, etc. The total effective rate for treating angina pectoris was 94.71%. And the ECG improvement rate was 63.38%. In addition, laboratory examination also revealed that Shenshao tongguan plan could promote the left ventricular output, lower the blood viscosity and inhibit the aggregation of blood platelet. Both acute and chronic toxicity tests showed that Shenshao tongguan plan has no toxicity or side effects.<br>
Kuo-guan granule is another herbal preparation for angina pectoris. Li Y et al. (1990) reported that the changes of the plasma zinc, copper and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase were measured by atomic absorption spectrometry and DTNB color development in 31 patients suffering from coronary heart disease with angina pectoris before and after taking Kuo-Guan granule for one month. The results indicated that the plasma zinc and erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase were lower and copper was higher in the patients than the normal control group before treatment (P 
Saponin of Tribulus terrestris was another herbal composition for treating angina pectoris.<br>
Fufang Danshen Pian is a folk prescription of Dan Shen Tablet which indicate for treating chronic stable angina pectoris due<br>
4<br><br>
to coronary artery ischemia and has been officially listed in the editions of Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1977 and applied to clinical use for decades.<br>
Fufang Danshen Pian contains multiple active extracts of botanical including Danshen (Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae), and Sanchi (Radix Notoginseng) . Both of the botanical were first documented in Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing (Shen-nong's HerbaLPharmacopoeia) completed in 200. Fufang Danshen Pian also contains synthetic bomeol, a version of a natural borneol (Bingpian) . Natural bomeol was first documented in Tang Ben Cao (Herbal Pharmacopoeia of the Tang Dynasty) compiled around 659,<br>
Li Cheng-zhu et al (1979) reported in (Acta Acad Med Prim Shanghai) on an experimental study of thrombotic inhibition effect of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae.  Effects on in vitro thrombosis, functions of platelet and coagulation, fibrinolysis were observed in rabbits. After injection of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae,  3 links were found to play an important role in inhibition of in vitro thrombosis: (1) inhibition of platelet function; (2) inhibition of coagulation function; and (3) promote fibrinolysis. Of which, the former two mechanisms function more intensely. The results conform to those in the treatment of thrombotic diseases, especially arterial thrombotic diseases.<br>
Chiang WT et al (1982) reported in (Acta Acad Med Prim Shanghai) the effects of "Danshensu" and other two water-soluble components of salvia miltiorrhiza on dog ischemic myocardium and isolated pig coronary artery. The effect of 3 new water-soluble components i.e. Danshensu (DS-182, D( + )-3,4-"dihydroxyphenyl lactic acid) , protocathu-aldehyde (PCAD) and an impure diterpene acid (DS-187) isolated from Salvia mil tiorrhiza Bunge, were compared with those of dipyridamole. Results revealed (1) in mice, DS-182 gave significant protection against hypoxia, whereas PCAD was ineffective; (2) DS-182 could nullify the pituitrin-induced electrocardiographic  ischemic  ST-T  elevation but  had no<br>
5<br><br>
influence on the reduced heart rate. DS-187, PCAD and dipyridamole only showed incomplete protection; (3) in the acutely infarcted dog model prepared by ligation of the anterior descending branch of the left coronary artery, the benefits achieved by intravenous injection of DS-182 proved superior to DS-187 and PCAD in respect to the left ventricular function, left ventricular peak systolic pressure(LVPSP) and left ventricular end diastolic pressure(LVEDP). PCAD, on the contrary, produced adverse effects on LVPSP and LVEDP. Intravenously administered dipyridamole, though it did not change LVEDP, suppressed LVPSP significantly with marked hypotensive effect. All these components of Salvia and dipyridamole significantly reduced the ultimate myocardial infarct size (N-BT assessment); Ds-182 was most effective, dipyridamole and DS-187 the next, while PCAD the least; (4) in the isolated perfused pig coronary artery preparation, DS-182 significantly reduced the resistance of the coronary vessel, whereas either DS-187, PCAD or sodium Tanshinone II-A sulfonate (DS-201), another component of Salvia, increased it. The constrictory action of morphine and propranolol on the isolated coronary artery preparation was antagonized by the prior administration of DS-182. All of these suggested that Danshensu might be the main active principle of Salvia miltiorrhiz'a in treating ischemic heart disease and that its concomitant use with propranolol or morphine would be beneficial.<br>
Li Cheng-zhu et al (1983) reported in (Chin J Integr Med) the<br>
anti-coagulation effect of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae. Danshensu is<br>
a water-soluble monomer extracted from Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae.<br>
It is also the main ingredient of commercially sold Injection Radix<br>
Silviae Miltiorrhizae.     The present study proved that Danshensu<br>
inhibits thrombosis in vitro, aggregation of platelet (induced by<br>
ADP),and internal and external coagulation systems; diminishes the<br>
number of platelets and promotes the degradation of fibrin or fibrinogen.<br>
The effects peaked 30 minutes after a single injection of 20 mg/kg in<br>
rabbits, lasted for 1 hour, and recovered gradually. 4.5 hours after<br>
injection, all recovered to normal but thrombosis test in vitro.<br>

Chen Zhanghua (1987) reported in Acta Acad Med Prim Shanghai on effects of "Danshensu" on experimental microcirculatory disturbances and plasm lactic acid concentrations. Natural Danshensu is a water soluble monomer extracted from Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae(RSM). Microcirculatory disturbances in rabbits were induced by intravenous injection of high molecular weight dextran. Natural Danshensu(dosage 4-6mg/kg) markedly increased the number of capillary vessels in the bulbar conjunctiva, and also decreased the concentration of plasm lactic acid in the rabbits. Mesenteric microcirculatory disorders were produced by local noradrenaline (4 g) drip in mice. Natural Danshensu dilated the arteries and accelerated the speed of blood flow, thus eliminating microcirculatory blood stasis. In our experiments, effects of synthetic Danshensu were observed concomitantly. The results showed that there was no significant difference between natural and synthetic Danshensu, in relieving microcirculatory disturbances.<br>
Sun Xi-ming et al (1991) reported a new pharmacological action of an extract of Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) . The paper reports that an extract of Danshen {Salvia miltiorrhiza) which contains the sodium salts of D( + ) - (3, 4-dihydroxy phenyl) lactic acid-was found to possess a new pharmacological action of decreasing the biosynthesis of cholesterol in cells and anti-lipoprotein oxidation, by cell cultural studies. When compared with the control, its electrophoretic migration rate was markedly lowered and MDA content and cytotoxicity decreased obviously. These results indicated that salts of D(+)-(3,4-dihydroxy phenyl) lactic acid may be effective in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis.<br>
Zheng Ruo-xuan et al (1992) reported in (Chin J Integr Med) the preservation effect of  Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae on myocardial ischemia induced by coronary ligation in mice. Obvious preservation effect on acute myocardial ischemia in mice by<br>
7<br><br>
coronary ligation could be obtained after i.p. water-extract of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae (5 g crude drug/kg). S-T segment elevation on ECG due to myocardial ischemia in the treatment group was much lower, ischemic size of the left ventricle was smaller and the survival rate was higher when compared with the control.<br>
Wu Yao-zhong et al (1995) reported in (Acta Nanjing Univ Trad Chin Mater Med) on effects of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae in promoting blood circulation by removing blood stasis. Pharmacological research of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae is common. However, rheological studies on Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae by assessing PGI2, ET, and TXA2 produced by platelet are seldom. Influence of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae on thrombosis, changes of PT, KPTT, FG, ESR and HCT, and aggregation of platelet in rabbits are evaluated in the present study. Conclusions are that Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae reduces the synthesis of TXA2 and decreases the effects of enhancement of platelet aggregation and thrombosis.<br>
Shi Lin et al (1990) reported in (Acta Pharmcol Sin) on the effects of total saponins of Panax Notoginseng on increasing PGI2 in carotid artery and decreasing TXA2 in blood platelet. Total saponins of Panax notoginseng (PNS) were given orally 100 mg/(kg day) to rabbit for 8 wk. Aortic atherosclerotic plaque formation was restrained as compared that of to the control group. Radioimmunoassay was used to investigate the effects of PNS on the contents of prostacyclin in carotid artery and thromboxane A2 in rats' blood platelet. Oral administration of PNS 25, 50, 100 mg/(kg day) for 10 days caused an increase of prostacyclin in carotid artery and a decrease of thromboxane A2 in blood platelet as compared with the control group. These results showed that the anti-atherosclerotic action of PNS may be a result of the correction of the imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane A2.<br>
Li Xing et al (1990) reported in (Acta Pharmacol Sin) the<br>
8<br><br>
Protective effects of Panax Notoginseng saponin on experimental myocardial injury induced by ischemia and reperfusion in rats. Effects of total saponin of Panax Notoginseng (PNS) and purified ginsenoids Rbl and Rg1 from PNS on myocardial injury induced by cardiac ischemia and. reperfusion were studied using rat hearts in situ and in vitro. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, PNS pretreatment (100 and 200 mg/kg) provided significant reduction in myocardial infarcted size after left descending coronary artery ligation (40 min) and reperfusion (120 min) in comparison with the control. PNS 12 . 5 and 25 mg/L, Rbl 10 mg/L and Rg1 10 mg/L significantly decreased cardiac CPK release, attenuated myocardial Ca++ accumulation, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) production and prevented reduction of superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in comparison with the control in perfused isolated rat hearts with global ischemia (40 min) and reperfusion (15 min). The results showed that PNS, Rbi and Rgl prevented cardiac ischemia and the action was considered to be related to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation.<br>
Huang Cong et al (1991) reported in (Chin Bull Pharmacol)the effects of Panax Notoginseng Saponin on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in conscious rabbits. The effects of Panax Notoginseng saponin (PNGS) on myocardial ischemia and reperfusion injury in conscious rabbits were studied with observation of changes in electrocardiogram (ECG), the activities of creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LD) and the size of ischemic area. PNGS at the dose of 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced the size of myocardial ischemic area. These results suggested that PNGS have the protective effects on myocardial ischemia • and reperfusion injury.<br>
Mo Qi-xian et al (1987) reported in (Propriet Trad Chin Med Res) the dynamics of 3H-Borneol. In order to highlight the mechanism of inducing resuscitation of Borneol aromaticity, dynamics of 3H-Borneol were conducted by intraveneous injection and oral<br>
9<br><br>
administration . The results revealed that the half-life time was 2.8 min after a single intraveneous injection of 3H-Borneol. It suggested that the drug distributed rapidly to the relevent organs and tissues after administration and produced prompt effect. In vivo distribution concentrated on organs and tissues which are abundant in blood flow  such as heart, lung, liver, kidney and brain, etc. This provided clinical application certain theoratical basis . Since the diminishing half-life time was 5.3 hours after oral administration of the drug, this suggested that oral Borneol could not lead to accumulation, but poor bioavailability. Further studies should be taken to discusse the relationship with drug dose and dosage form.<br>
Chen Tie-feng et al (1990) reported in (Acta Pharmacol Sin)  the enhancement of absorption of tetramethylpyrazine by synthetic borneol. Sprague-Dawley rats were given ig tetramethylpyrazine phosphate (TMP) 5 mg/kg with or without previous borneol 5 mg/kg. The plasm TMP concentrations were analysed by GC method, and the data were treated by NONLIN program. The Cmax were 931 and 562 ng/ml, respectively, (p
Xu Wei et al (1995) reported in (Pharmacol Chin Med Clin) the effect of menthol and borneol on the distribution of sulfadiazine sodium and Evan's blue in the rat and mouse brain. Menthol (1.5 g/kg, ig) and Borneol  (1.5 g/kg) prolonged the sulfadiazine sodium distribution half-life t1/2 in rats. The above dosage of menthol and borneol given orally al'so increased the concentration of sulfadiazine sodium in the rat brain. Menthol (ig 0.5g/kg for 3 days) and borneol (ig 0.5 g/kg for 3 days) promoted the concentration of Evan's blue in the mouse brain, but the value of concentration was significantly lower than that of the mice suffering from the ischemia-reperfusion injury. The results suggested that the menthol and borneol could enhanced the sulfadiazine sodium transfer in brain-blood barrier with no<br>

damage to brain-blood barier.<br>
In the United States, coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is the commonest cause of cardiovascular disability and death.<br>
Atherosclerosis is an arterial disorder characterized by yellowish plaques of cholesterol, lipids, and cellular debris in the inner layers of the walls of large and medium-size arteries. The condition begins as a fatty streak and gradually builds to a fibrous plaque or atheromatous lesion. The blood'vessel walls become thick, fibrotic, and calcified. The artery lumen narrows.<br>
Many atherosclerotic plaques remain stable or progress gradually. Others may rupture resulting in hemorrhage, platelet activation, and thus intravascular thrombosis. Coronary thrombosis causes partial or complete vessel occlusion, impairs blood flow, thus leads to unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Alternately, the ruptured plaques may become restabilized, often more severe stenosis.<br>
Exercise and mental stresses increase myocardial oxygen demand. Under normal physiological condition, increased myocardial oxygen demand is met by the arterioles dilating thus increasing blood flow. In the presence of atherosclerosis, the arterioles may dilate maximally to meet basic demand. Such dilated arterioles may be unable to meet the increased myocardial oxygen demand. When oxygen demand exceeds oxygen supply, the ischemia of myocardium occurs. Alternately, severe vessel occlusions may limit blood flow thus cause myocardial ischemia. Clinical manifestations of transient myocardial ischemia is angina pectoris which is a paroxysmal thoracic pain, frequently spread to the arms, particularly to the left arm, with or without accompanied by a feeling of suffocating and impending death.<br>
Angina pectoris is subdivided in to two: stable and unstable. Stable angina pectoris is caused by the increased myocardial oxygen demand in most cases. Stable angina thus attacks in the<br>
11<br><br>
predictable frequency and duration upon provocation which increases myocardial oxygen requirements such as exercise, mental stress, etc. In contrast, unstable angina pectoris attacks without provocation and usually caused by decreased oxygen supply to myocardium. Plaque disruption, platelet plugging, and coronary thrombosis decrease oxygen supply to myocardium.<br>
Angina pectoris is treated with various drugs, surgical procedure, coronary artery bypass graft, balloon-angioplasty, stent placement, etc. Therapy for stable angina pectoris is primarily to minimize myocardial oxygen demand as well as a preventive measure. Therapy for the acute syndrome unstable angina pectoris is primarily to inhibit platelet activation and thrombolysis.<br>
Current therapeutic agents for chronic stable angina pectoris are nitroglycerine, other nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and beta-adrenergic receptor blockers . These drugs, administered alone or in combination with other drugs, alleviate or prevent rather than cure angina.<br>
When angina attacks, nitroglycerine is administered sublingually to alleviate symptoms. Nitroglycerine is also applied to prevent anginal attacks caused by exertion and stress. Nitrates are applied to prevent angina attacks. Nitroglycerine and nitrates mediate their effect primarily by relaxing vascular smooth muscle, reducing myocardial activity, and thus reducing myocardial oxygen demand. The side effects are throbbing headache, dizziness, weakness, orthostatic hypotension, tachycardia, etc.<br>
Beta-adrenergic receptor . blockers such as propranolol are applied to prevent angina pectoris by reducing myocardial oxygen requirements during exertion and stress. The major contraindications are bronchospastic disease, bradyarrhythmias, and overt heart failure. In individuals with asthma and other forms of airway obstruction, beta-blockers may worsen their condition.<br>
12<br><br>
Calcium antagonists are applied to prevent angina pectoris by reducing the oxygen demand of myocardium. Myocardium is dependent on calcium influx for normal functions. By inhibiting calcium influx, calcium antagonists may relax smooth muscle of the blood vessel, decrease myocardium activity, reduce oxygen demand by myocardium, and thus prevent angina pectoris. Calcium antagonists have adverse side effects. The mild side effects are flushing, edema, dizziness, nausea, etc. Excessive inhibition of calcium influx to myocardium may cause severe side effects such as cardiac arrest, bradycardia, artrioventricular block, congestive heart failure, etc. Combined with beta-adrenergic drugs, the side effects of calcium antagonists are often augmented.<br>
In China, Panax Notoginseng and Radix Salviae Miltorrhizae have been used for treating cardiovascular disease since 200 AD (Shen-nong's Herbal Pharmacopoeia). Panax Notoginseng has been used for treating angina pectoris. Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae has been used for promoting blood circulation and dispersing blood stasis. Numerous preclinical and clinical studies demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Panax Notoginseng and Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae.<br>
Traditional Chinese medicine is the mixture of several herbs requiring decoction. A modified form of Chinese medicine for treating coronary heart disease is Dan Shen tablet. Dan Shen tablet is a large unctuous ball, often as large as 1 cM in diameter. Dan Shen tablets are made of the extract of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae, powder of Panax Notoginseng and synthetic borneol, have been listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1977, and have been used to treat cardiovascular disease for decades.<br>
The disclosed Danshen pill (DSP), or called cardiotonic pill is a new generation Chinese medicine for coronary heart diseases. Chinese medicine consists of various herbs which vary from prescription to prescription in regard to the type of herbs as<br>
13<br><br>
well as the proportion of herbs. To control the quality, DSP is manufactured with the standarized formula. The therapeutic components of DSP are the water-soluble extracts of Radix Salviae Miltiorrhizae 10-30 % and sometimes, approximately 20 %, the water-soluble extracts of Panax Notoginseng (2-6 %) , and borneol (1-3 %). Furthermore, to alleviate angina quickly, DSP been manufactured as a small pill which can be dissolved immediately upon sublingual administration, delivered to myocardium quickly, and thus alleviate angina fast.<br>
DSP has been proven to be nontoxic and effective for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease caused by coronary artery ischemia in preclinical and clinical studies. Furthermore, the superior efficacy of DSP to Dan Shen tablets for treating coronary arterial disease has been demonstrated in preclinical as well as in clinical studies.<br>
DSP has been listed in the Supplement Edition of Chinese Pharmacopoeia since 1998, approved by the Chinese Ministry of Health, marketed as a drug in China since 1993, and used by more than five million people.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS<br>
First Series of Experiments Manufacturing of Dan Shen Pill (DSP)<br>
DSP is a small pill, approximately 25 mg, of which therapeutic components comprise water-soluble extracts of Notoginseng, water soluble extracts of Salviae, and synthetic borneol.<br>
For manufacturing DSP, Notoginseng and Salviae are extracted separately with hot water in circulating systems and filtered. The filtrates are condensed under decompressed conditions, filtered and precipitated. The concentrates are refined using resin columns and concentrated under decompressed conditions. The refined water-soluble extracts thus obtained were mixed with synthetic Borneol and pharmaceutical carriers. The mixture is made to a small pill using a special dropping machine.  The quality of DSP is controlled by standarizing the quantity as well as the proportion of its major therapeutic components Saponon, phenolic acid such as  Danshensu and Borneol.  Thin-layer chromatography,  high  performance  liquid  chromatography, fingerprinting and other analytical techniques are used to identify and quantitate therapeutic components in DSP.<br>

CLINICAL STUDIES OF DSP<br>
Angina pectoris is evaluated by the history of angina, serum lipid level, electrocardiography (ECG), exercise ECG, scintiographic assessment of ischemia, coronary angiography, etc. Assessing therapeutic efficacy using these end points, DSP has been shown to be effective for treating angina pectoris.<br>
DSP is effective for angina pectoris.<br>
157 patients with coronary heart disease were treated with 10 DSPs per t.i.d., oral administration for 4 weeks. Assessing the frequency, intensity and duration of angina, oppressed feeling in chest and palpitation, the symptoms were disappeared or remitted in 95.3% patients.<br>
DSP is more efficient than Dan Shen tablets in alleviating angina. Dan Shen tablet is another Chinese medicament for treating angina pectoris currently used in China. The efficacy of DSP and Dan Shen tablet was compared. Coronary heart disease patients were randomly divided into two groups. 107 patients were treated with DSP and 50 patients were treated with Dan Shen Tablet. Comparing the frequency of angina attacks and the consumption of nitrates, DSP was more effective than Dan Shen Tablets for treating angina pectoris. See Table 5 below.<br>

Having proven that DSP is more effective than Dan Shen tablets, the efficacy of DSP was compared with various drugs which are currently used for treating chronic stable angina pectoris in the US.<br>
Comparison of DSP and nitroglycerine<br>
Nitroglycerine is the frequently used to relieve angina. The efficacy of DSP and nitroglycerine relieving angina was compared. At the onset of angina, patients were treated with either DSP or nitroglycerine, and the time required to alleviate angina was compared. Both DSP and nitroglycerine alleviate angina in all patients within 15 minutes . The efficacy of DSP was slightly lower than nitroglycerine. See Table 6 below.<br>

Comparison of the efficacy of DSP with the nitrate isosorbide dinitrate<br>
Having proven that DSP alleviate angina as efficiently as nitroglycerin, it was examined whether DSP can prevent angina. The efficacy of DSP and the nitrate isosorbide dinitrate was compared. Isosorbide dinitrate is a long-acting nitrate frequently used for preventing chronic stable angina pectoris in the US. Patients were treated with either DSP three times per day orally 10 pills per treatment or Isosorbide dinitrate three times per day orally 10 mg per treatment. Cardiac function and Electrocardiogram was examined.<br>
Cardiac function.<br>
The efficacy of DSP and nitrates on cardiac function was evaluated by measuring cardiac output per stroke (CO) , stroke volume per minute (SV), eject blood fraction (EF), fraction of shortened rate of left ventricular short axis (FS). DSP improves cardiac function more efficiently than nitrates. See Table 8 below.<br>

DSP lowers plasma cholesterol level<br>
Increased plasma cholesterol has been implicated in the initiation of atherosclerosis. To prevent the formation of new atherosclerotic lesions, the decrease of plasma cholesterol either by modifying diets or drugs was recommended. It was examined whether DSP decreases plasma cholesterol. DSP lowered the cholesterol level by 0.3 mmol/L, which is statistically significant at the P value 0.05. See Table 12 below.<br>

Cardiotonic Pill's Effect on LPO and SOD in the Blood Serum of Patients Suffering from Coronary Heart Disease<br>
The method; In the treatment group, 24 patients, in accordance<br>
with China Reference Diagnosis Standards for Coronary Heart<br>
Disease amended in 1979, are administered with Cardiotonic Pill,<br>
10 pills/time, and 3 times/day. In the normal group, 20 healthy<br>
54<br><br>
people do not receive any medical treatment.<br>
The results: The level of LPO of the patients suffering from coronary heart disease is clearly higher than that of the healthy people, while the content of SOD is'clearly lower (p

The conclusion: Chronic ischemia of cardiac muscle's of patients suffering from coronary heart disease and tissue anoxia lead to the reduction of the activity of SOD, especially that of extra cellular SOD, and the increase of oxygen free radicals, which causes the elevation of LPO and consumption of SOD further. After the patients are treated with Cardiotonic Pill, the level of LPO decreases evidently, while the content of the SOD increases obviously. This proves that Cardiotonic Pill has a strong action of clearance oil oxygen free radicals, which is also one of the mechanisms to treat coronary heart disease.<br>
The Effect of Cardiotonic Pill on the Activities of LPO and Antioxidases in Treatment of Pulmonary Heart Disease<br>
The method: The subjects: 48 patients suffering from pulmonary heart disease are randomly divided into 3 groups. In the normal group, 16 patients are treated with a complex of therapies, such as anti-inflamatory therapy, antiasthma, oxygen inhalation, and so on. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, 14 patients are treated with Cardiotonic Pill, 10 pills/time, and 3 times/day. In the<br>
55<br><br>
Gantangzhi group, 18 patients are treated with the intravenous<br>
drip	200mg of Gantangzhi dissolved in 250ml of 5% glucose<br>
injection, 1 time/day, and 10 days/period.<br>
The results: After treatment with Cardiotonic Pill, the value of GSH-Px goes up, the value of LPO goes down, and, therefore, GSH-Px/LPO goes up. In comparison with the normal treatment group, there is a significant difference. See Table 14 below.<br>

The conclusion: Cardiotonic Pill has the function of antioxidation, and can lighten the lipid peroxidation reaction and raise the ability of antioxidation of human body.<br>
Treatment with Cardiotonic Pill for Essential Hypertension<br>
The method: (1) The choice of patients: Select those patients suffering from Phase I or II essential hypertension, but without secondary  hypertension  or  cardiac,  hepatic  and  renal<br>
insufficiencies.<br>
(2) The administration: Stop the patients from taking any western<br>
and traditional Chinese medicines (except for hypotensors) for<br>
two weeks, and then, in the third week, measure their blood<br>
pressures and blood rheologyical indices and take down their<br>
clinical manifestations. The double blind method is adopted. In<br>
56<br><br>
the Cardiotonic Pill group, the subjects take orally Cardiotonic Pill, 10 pills/time, and 3 times/day. In Compound Danshen Tablet group, the subjects take orally Compound Danshen Tablet, 5 tablets/time, and 3 times/day. The subjects in the control group take placebos, and the period of treatment is six weeks.<br>
The results: (1) Effect on the viscosity of whole blood. After treatment, the viscosities of whole blood of patients in both the Cardiotonic Pill group and the Compound Danshen Tablet group drop remarkably, but the curves of the viscosities of whole blood in the Cardiotonic Pill group at any shear rates go down more sharply than those in the Compound Danshen Tablet group.

The conclusion: The rheological property of erythrocytes of patients suffering from essential hypertension is clearly abnormal. The deformation of erythrocytes debases clearly, while the aggregation rises distinctly. The experiment shows that Cardiotonic Pill has the functions of markedly reducing the viscosity of whole blood and the index of and the area of aggregation of erythrocytes, and greatly raising the ability of deformation of erythrocytes. Cardiotonic Pill can also lower the blood pressure and improve clinical symptoms of the patients. And thus, Cardiotonic Pill is of great benefit to preventing or postponing the occurrence of essential hypertension   and cardio-cerebral syndrome.<br>
Toxicity<br>
DSP is safe and nontoxic. In China, over 5 million patients have been treated with DSP without severe side effects. Mild side effects, headache or dizziness, have been reported in a minor portion of patients.<br>
Summary of clinical studies<br>
DSP is a new generation Chinese medicine for treating coronary heart disease. Clinical studies demonstrate that DSP alleviates as well as prevent angina by improving cardiac function, reducing<br>
59<br><br>
myocardial ischemia, inhibiting platelet activation thus reducing blood stasis, and decreasing plasma cholesterol. The therapeutic efficacy of DSP was superior to another form of Chinese medicament Dan Shen tablets . DSP is as efficient as drugs used in the USA. DSP is aleviate angina as efficiently as nitroglycerine, prevents angina as efficiently as the long-acting nitrate isosorbid dirtitrate, and inhibits platelet aggregation as effectively as aspirin. DSP is nontoxic: over 5 million people have been treated without noticeable side effects in most cases.<br>
PRECLINICAL STUDIES<br>
Preclinical studies reveal the mechanism by which DSP prevent<br>
as well as alleviate angina.<br>
DSP alleviate angina by increasing blood flow. Wistar rats; approximately 260 g, were anesthetized by urethane, opened the chest, excise the heart, perfused in the Langendorff mode at 37°C.   And constant coronary perfusion pressure of 65 cm H2O.<br>
After stabilized the heart rate, various amounts of DSP or Danshen tablet were applied each time through lateral branch of aorta cannula. Subsequently, the coronary flow and the heart rate were measured. DSP increased coronary flow, in a wide dosage. Danshen tablet, on the other hand, increased coronary flow at a narrow dosage. See Table 19 below.<br>
60<br><br><br>
The effect of DSP and Danshen tablets on heart rate was examined. Neither DSP nor Danshen tablet changes heart rate. See Table 20 below.<br>

Cardiotonic Pill's Action of Clearance on Oxygen Free Radicals<br>
The study of Cardiotonic Pill's action of clearance on oxygen free radicals is carried out by using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and spin trapping, with superoxide anions and hydroxy radicals produced by using the xanthine- xanthine oxidase system and the H2O2-Fe2+ system respectively.<br>
The method: (1) Production of hydroxy radicals. Set up a test model according to the Fenton Principle. Mix up H2O2, ferrisulphas and DMPO (5, 5-dimethyl-pyrroline-l-oxide), and then carry out r.he EPR testing. The resulting signals serve as the control. Add<br>

Cardiotonic Pill in the treatment group.<br>
(2) Production of superoxide anions. Set up a test model based on the xanthine- xanthine oxidase reaction. Mix up xanthine, Dietrylene triamine Pentacetic acid, DMPO and xanthine oxidase, and then carry out the EPR testing. The resulting signals serve as the control. Add Cardiotonic Pill in the treatment group.<br>
Ten samples for each of the four groups are tested, and the results are expressed in terms of the average. T-test is applied in the statistical analysis.<br>
The Results: (1) Cardiotonic Pill's action of clearance on hydroxy radicals produced by the H202-Fe2+ system. An adduct DMPO-OH will be generated when a hydroxy radical is captured by a DMPO. The peak value of the adducts in the control group is 11.8±0.6 relative units, while that in the Cardiotonic Pill group is 4.1 ± 0.5 relative units. There is a significant difference between them (p
(2) Cardiotonic Pill's action of clearance on superoxide anions produced by the xanthine- xanthine oxidase system. An adduct DMPO-OOH will be generated when a superoxide anion is captured by a DMPO. The peak value of the adducts in the control group is 10.6±0.67 relative units, while the spectral signals in the Cardiotonic Pill group disappear completely. In comparison with the control group, there is a significant difference (p
The above experiments show that Cardiotonic Pill has an effective action of clearance on superoxide anions produced by the xanthine- xanthine oxidase system and hydroxy radicals produced<br>
by the H202-Fe2+ system.<br>
Cardiotonic Pill's Effect on Free Radicals of Cerebral Ischemia Reinfusion Injury Tissue of Rats<br>
65<br><br>
The method: Take 30 SD rats, and randomly divide them into 3 groups, which are the feigned operation group (An operatibn is performed, but the blood vessels and nerves are not ligated), the cerebral ischemia reinfusion model group and the Cardiotonic Pill group (4g/kg). After the 3-day continuous intraperitoneal (Ip) administration, and two hours after the administration on the third day, the rats are anaesthetized with the 20% Ethylurethanm and their conducting arteries in both sides of their necks and vagus nerves are separated and ligated. After a 30-minute reinfusion, cut off their heads and get their brains. Take about 500mg of cortical tissues of their left-brains and hippocampus tissues in both sides', and put them into the liquid nitrogen for homogenization. After they are made into a homogenate with freezing physiological saline, centrifugate the homogenate. Take the supernatant and determine the activities of CAT and SOD and the contents of MAD and GSH.<br>
The results: See Table 29. (1) Cardiotonic Pill's effect on the activity of CAT and the content GSH of brain tissues. The activities of CAT of brain cortex and hippocampus tissues and the content of GSH of the brain cortex in the cerebral ischemia reinfusion model group are much lower than those in the feigned operation group. Both the activity of CAT of hippocampus tissues and the content of GSH of the brain cortex in the Cardiotonic Pill group are significantly greater than those in the model group.<br><br>

(2) Cardiotonic Pill's effect on the activity of SOD and the content MDA of brain tissues. The activity of SOD of brain tissues in the model group is significantly lower than that in the feigned operation group, while the content of MDA is significantly higher. The activities of SOD of.brain cortex and hippocampus tissues in the Cardiotonic Pill group increase significantly, while the content of MDA decreases significantly.<br>
The conclusion: After cerebral ischemia reinfusion, the content of MDA in the brain tissues increases, while the content of GSH decreases. The activities of CAT and SOD, two important enzymes for clearing oxygen free radicals in the tissues, decrease significantly, which shows that during the course of cerebral ischemia reinfusion, a great lot of oxygen free radicals occur due to the failure of the function of the free radical clearance system. This leads to the lipid peroxidation, and then leads to the brain injury. Cardiotonic Pill can decrease the contents of MDA in the brain cortex and hippocampus tissues of reinfused rats and increase the content of GSH and the activities of CAT and SOD greatly, which shows that Cardiotonic Pill has the functions of markedly restraining the reactions of oxygen free radicals, controlling the lipid peroxidation and protecting damaged brain cells caused by ischemia reinfusion.<br>
The Antioxidation of Cardiotonic Pill in Chronic Hepatic Injury<br>
The method: The CCL4-high-fat-low-protein induced mild chronic hepatic injury model of the Wister rat is adopted. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, perfuse Cardiotonic Pill into the rats' stomachs at the dose of 4g/kg, while in the normal and the model groups, perfuse the same amount of physiological saline. The activity of SOD is determined by using the xanthine oxidase method, while the content of the MDA is determined by using the improved thiobarbituric acid method.<br>
The results: See Table 30. Comparing the model group with the normal group, the activity of SOD degrades, while that of MDA increases. In the Cardiotonic Pill group, however, the activity of SOD increases,<br>
67<br><br>
while that of MDA degrades, making the Cardiotonic Pill group go back<br>
to the normal.<br>

 <br>
The conclusion: MDA is a major degradation product of the lipid peroxidation. MDA can badly damage the structure of the cell membrane, and then hepatic cells. SOD is a scavenger of super-oxide anion free radicals, and it can restrain the lipid peroxidation caused by free radicals. Cardiotonic Pill can significantly increase the activity of SOD and decrease the content of MDA, which will degrade the level of the lipid peroxidation and lighten the hepatic injury.<br>
DSP is not mutagenic<br>
It was examined whether DSP is mutagenic in the Ames assay. DSP<br>
was not mutagenic. See Table 31 below.<br><br>

Production of  crude drugs<br>
1. Dan shen<br>
(1)	Quality control<br>
Crude drug Dan Shen was sampled from production arias throughout China. Chemical analysis was conducted on those samples from different bases for their chief components. The results showed that the quality of Dan Shen from an aria named Shangluo was the best of all and it proved that the climate of Shangluo is most suitable for the growth of Dan Shen. The active ingredients of Dan Shen such as tanshinone and salvianic acid A. were approved the best in quantity.<br>
(2)	Topography<br>
Shangluo is geographically located at the East Longitude 108°34'20"-111°1'25" and North Altitude 33°2'30' '- 34°24'40" with an average sea level of 900 meters. The region is an area with low and median high mountains and is free of pollutions. The unpolluted clean air circumstance makes it ideal for the growth of drug plants.<br>
(3)	Climate<br>
It is warm and semi-humid in climate, typical for the mountainous areas of transitional zone from the subtropics to the temperate. Affected by the South-eastern monsoons, it has obvious divisions for seasons and a great amount of rain. The precipitation of rainfall of the year in this area is estimated at 733.9-899 mm. The sunshine period is around 1874.1-2185 hours a year, with an annual sun irridiance of 119.57-124.36 kilocalories/cm2. The temperature varies from 18 °C ~ 40.8 °C. A frost-free period lasts<br>
69<br><br>
198-218 days of the year.<br>
(4)	Soil<br>
80% of the soil in Shangluo is arenaceous, most of the arable land comprises of neutral and alkalescent soil with a pH value of 6 . 5-8 . Within 0-20 cm of the tillage layer, the soil nutrients consist of the following: 1.36% organic matter; 0.085% nitrogen; 18 ppm fast-effective phosphor; 136 ppm fast-effective potassium; and 60 ppm alkaline-hydrolyzed nitrogen. Heavy metals and other toxic matters contained in the soil do not exceed the agricultural standards set by the country. The region is rich in plants and animals.  Local farmers use organic fertilizers.<br>
(5)	Heavy Metals:<br>
The eight metals, including Lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic, etc. , the pesticide residues, air and water all meet the country<br>
environment standards.<br>
(6)	Standardization<br>
The planting and plowing of Dan Shen follow the standard of Good Agriculture Practice (GAP). Technological know-how relevant to the growing of Dan Shen is compiled into a booklets and distributed among the Dan Shen growers in the base. During the planting seasons, technicians are sent to the fields to give growers training on the spot and offer technical support, so as to standardize the planting of Dan Shen on a large plantation-like scale.<br>
(7)	The Shangluo production base had bred and cultivated 20<br>
different breeds of Dan Shen. Different Dan Shens were observed<br>
and compared in their growth situations, yield, appearance and<br>
chemical components for three years. The best breeds in quality<br>
chosen for large-scale plantation.<br>
(8)	Tissue cultivation and clone technology are adopted in the<br>
Dan Shen cultivation to accelerate the procedure and shorten the<br>
circle of growth.<br>
70 <br><br>
(9)	After a 30-day period of test-tube planting, an enlarged<br>
reproduction procedure is taken. It lasts 40 days before the root<br>
period. The root period will takes another 10 days that is- for<br>
the plants to generate and enrich their roots. The rate of<br>
rooting usually reaches 90% or above. The plant can then be<br>
transferred to the nursery, where advanced spray irrigation<br>
device and conditions are controlled-by computer technology. The<br>
plants can be transplanted to the outside field after a month<br>
cultivation in the nursery.<br>
(10)	According to the experts, the cultivated Dan Shen from our<br>
product base are not only in high quality but also productive<br>
for their productive roots (50% more in root weight than those<br>
from other areas), and high chemical composition (70% higher in<br>
active drug ingredients than samples from other places) .<br>
2. Natural Borneol<br>
(1)	Growth Conditions<br>
The growth areas of natural Borneol are Xinhuang county of Hunan province, China, a region with mid-height hills at a sea level of 300-600m. 60% of the area is covered by forest. The land consists of yellow and red sand soil with pH 5-6. No air or water pollutions are found within the region.<br>
(2)	Biological Characteristics of the tree<br>
Extremely strong growth capability, it grows in brushwood field, 300-4 00 trees per mu (equal to 666. 7 m2) ; Parts above branch leaves are collected; net gain is 1000 kg per mu.<br>
(3)	Reproduction and transplant<br>
Use grafting and cuttage technology for reproduction.  The Plant grows in the nursery garden during the first year and is transplanted to the filed in the spring of the second year. The filed need to be fertilized and scarified periodically.<br>

Immerse the sample into the solution and keep it for 24 hours, take it out and cut it into half and place one-half into a cilture disk. Use the prepared 0.1% TTC to dye the sample for 30 minutes. The vitality of the seeds can be determined by the color of the seeds<br>
(16)	Inspection of Pests<br>
i. Observe the seed with human eyes while placing 500-1000 sample pellets on a white sheet of paper or glass. If unusual spots or pests appear on the surface of the sample, the contamination can be decided. Contaminated samples should be taken apart and be identified for its level of contamination.<br>
ii. Cutting and Inspect: use a scalpel to cut and open 2 sample sets each contain 100 seeds.  Calculate the<br>
74<br><br>
number of contaminated seeds to determine the level of contamination.<br>
iii. Smell to inspect samples: place them in hand and detect them by nose for any moldy odor. Or simply leave sample in a cup containing heated, water (60-70 °C), and covered for 2-3 minutes, pour out the water and smell the seeds. The seeds should send forth a delicate fragrance, if not, it is probably contaminated.<br>

(8)	Soil Preparation<br>
Soil plotting should be repeated for 3 times before planting, and soil be exposed under sunlight, it helps to exterminate bacteria substance in the soil.<br>
(9)	Handle with Soil<br>
For prevention of root damage, 75-100g of lime is used each square meter before transplanting.<br>
(10)	Construction and management of Shade<br>
The shade is 1.8m above ground with a 2m deep trench below the ground. Sunlight penetration is best at 8-10% if in area of no more than 1600 m above sea level, or 10-15% if it is more than 1600 m. The ground should be flat; deep layer of the earth should be lose; while the surface level of the earth should be rigid. Planting season is best at the end of December to the end of January.<br>
77<br><br>
Before planting, the seeds should be immersed in 58% metalaxylic zinc (500-800x) or 1.5% antimycin (200ppm) for 30-50 minutes and dip out to let dry. This is to protect the plant from diseases (Coated seeds do not have to undergo the above procedures). Density of planting is to be 4 x 5 cm or 5 x 5 cm, with 100-200 thousand seeds per mu of land. Use special tools to create a shallow gutter and use machine or hands to seed and plant. Seeds are covered with fine soil completely.<br>
After all, fertilizing, watering and weeding tasks are performed. Weeds should be eliminated all the time. If the shade is broken, it should be repaired immediately and ensured the correct penetration of sunlight. Natural fertilizers including poultry waste, stove dust, and bone dust (human waste should not apply).<br>

Second Series of Experiments<br>
This invention involves a medication which can prevent and cure coronary heart disease with angina pectoris, the methods of manufacture and other usages of the medication. The medication, Dan Shen Pill (DSP) , is made from a variety of Chinese herbs using a series of standardized procedures.<br>
DSP is an improvement on Dan Shen Tablet (DST) (recorded in Pharmacopoeia of the People' s Republic of China in Edition, 1977, 1985, 1995, and 2000), but there are significant differences between DSP and DST: proportions in their formulas, manufacturing techniques and their clinical results.<br>
The number of patients with cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases increases along with higher living standards (better supply of foods), the worldwide aging problem, and young adult's involvement. It has become the second most-common diseases worldwide threatening the health of human beings. Angina pectoris is caused by insufficient blood and oxygen supply to the heart. The main clinical symptom is chest pain. It is caused by atherosclerosis or spasms of coronary artery in about 90% of the angina pectoris patients.<br>
The major treatments for angina pectoris are vessel dilation, lowering of blood viscosity, anti-aggregation of platelets and anti-coagulation. The'traditional medicines used are nitrates, beta-adrenoceptor blocking drugs and calcium-channel blocking drugs. However, all these drugs have many side effects which make them unsuitable for long-term use. For example, patients experience a swelling sensation in their heads, faster heartbeat and even coma after taking glyceryl trinitrate.<br>
Although there are many Chinese herbal medicines used for treating angina pectoris, fewer people use them nowadays. DST<br>
86<br><br>
or capsules are being sold in the market, but their manufacturing techniques are old, the efficacy is low and there are no quality standards, DST is taken orally and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, where it is absorbed into blood vessels after processing in the liver. The bioavailability is low, and the absorption speed is low, which is not suitable for the emergency treatment of patients with angina pectoris.<br>
In order to compensate for the inadequacy of the above technology, the drug disclosed in this invention was developed to provide high efficacy for the prevention and cure of cqronary heart disease with angina pectoris.<br>
The other aims of this invention are to provide other medical uses in addition to the prevention and cure of coronary heart disease, the proportion of herb composition and the method of<br>
manufacturing this drug.<br>
This drug is prescribed according to traditional Chinese medical theory and modern pharmaceutical research. Chinese medical theories state that chest pains are caused by blood stagnation in the arteries, lack of blood supply and blood nourishment to the heart. After pharmaceutical experimentation and clinical observation, Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae is used as the main ingredient. Panax Notoginseng and borneol are the co-ingredients which eliminate blood stagnation, thereby preventing and curing coronary heart disease with angina pectoris. The above ingredients are grouped and mixed with other inactive ingredients to make DSP.<br>
DSP can prevent and cure coronary heart disease with angina pectoris by the following mechanisms:<br>
Increase by the blood flow to the ischemic area: dilating the coronary artery, increasing blood flow to the coronary artery, and activating peripheral circulation to improve blood supply<br>
87<br><br>
to the ischemic area.<br>
Removing of free radicals: removing free radicals released by<br>
hypoxia and ischemia, reducing damage to myocardial muscles and<br>
increasing myocardial ATP content to protect myocardial muscles.<br>
Preventing the aggregation of platelets: controlling the release<br>
of platelet factors,  preventing platelet aggregation and<br>
increasing the PGI2/TXA2 ratio to prevent coagulation and<br>
thrombosis.<br>
Lowering of blood cholesterol: controlling the biosynthesis of<br>
cholesterol and lowering the synthesis of TG and LDL.<br>
Xin, Zhiqiang, et al. (1996) reported in the Chinese Journal of Integrated and Western Medicine on the effects of Radix Siliviae Miltiorrhizae on 24 patients with coronary heart disease and observed the changes in their LPO and SOD contents before and after treatment. Having compared these 2 4 patients with 20 healthy people, it was found that patients with coronary heart disease had a higher LPO content than normal healthy people and a lower SOD content. After undergoing treatment, patients' LPO level dropped significantly, while SOD level rose. Conclusions are that Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae can lower LPO, increase SOD activity, decrease platelet aggregation, improve myocardial ischemia, and protect the myocardial membrane.<br>
Chang, yingzi, et al. (1991) reported in the Chinese Journal of Pathology and Physiology on anexperiment in which FeS04 /Ascorbic was introduced to monitor the damaging effects of oxygen-free radicals on rod-shaped H+-ATPase of rat myocardial muscles. The results showed that FeS04/Ascorbic can lower the hydrolysis ability of the rod-shaped H+-ATPase. Moreover, Danshensu has an obvious protective function: It can prevent the decrease of the hydrolysis ability of rod-shaped H+-ATPase and shows a concentration-dependent relationship and saturation effect.<br>
Zheng, Ruoxuan, et al. (1992) reported in the Chinese Journal of Integrated and Western Medicine on an experiement in which<br>
88<br><br>
water extracted Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae (5g raw medicine/ kg) , was injected into rats. The water extraction prevents acute myocardial ischemia caused by blockage of the coronary artery. The, increased ECG section ST caused by myocardial ischemia after treatment was much lower than that in the control group. The area of left ventricular ischemia is minimized and the animal' s chance of survival is increased.<br>
Han, Chang, et al. (1991) reported in the Journal of Chinese Pathology and Physiology on an experiment in which the rabbits are anesthetized, chests opened, coronary artery tied to create an acute myocardial ischemia model, and then tested the change in local blood flow and myocardial lipid peroxidation content, an ECG was conducted while the animal was observed. DSP was injected as a protective agent. The results showed that myocardial lipid peroxidation content increases along with a longer duration of ischemia. When the heart is reperfused with blood for 30 minutes after a 60 minute ischemia, the lipid peroxidation content still increases continually, which is obviously higher than that of a 60-mins control group, but similar to that of a 90-mins control group. The blood flow of local tissue in the ischemia area recovered 53.2% after reperfusion, while in the DSP-protected group, the ischemia area decreased 56% after reperfusion (P
Jiang, Wende, et al. (1982) reported in Journal of Shanghai- the First Medicine College on an experiment which compared DSP, DS-781, PCAD and persantin using four different tests. Results: extraction of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae can significantly lengthen the toleration time, for hypoxia and protect ischemic EC change in mice. It can also prevent the lowering of LVPSP and rising of LVEDP. In contrast, PCAD lowers LVPSP and raises LVEDP more obviously. Vein injection to the persantin group can lower LVPSP but has no effect on LVEDP. The minimization of the area of  myocardio  infarction  by  Radix  Silviae  Miltiorrhizae<br>
89<br><br>
extraction is the most significant.<br>
Wu, Huaizhu, et al. (1994) reported in the Chinese Journal of Bloodology that the active principle of Radix Silviae Miltiorrhizae can suppress ADP or collagen-induced platelet ATP release and release relative aggregation. Inhibition shows a volume-effect relationship. 0.01-0.08 mmol/L764-3 can prolong the lag period in which arachidonic acid guides the activation of blood platelets . When concentration is increased to 0 . 08mmol/L, coagulation of blood platelets and the release of ATP can be fully controlled. Aequorin-loaded platelet suspension analysis discovered that 764-3 can obviously inhibit the increase in plasma Ca++ concentration and inhibit Ca++ internal reflux and the activity of internal Ca++. 764-3 can significantly inhibit the production of AA-induced platelet TXB2. Conclusions: 764-3 may suppress the metabolism of AA blood platelets.<br>
Sun, Ximing reported in Chinese Traditional and Herbal Drugs that research is being conducted on the pharmaceutical effects of Danshensu using the cell model. It has been discovered that Danshensu can lower the biosynthesis of cholesterol and obviously lower migration ratio of electrophoresis. The MDA content in oxidized lipoproteins decrease and the toxicity of oxidized lipoprotein is also reduced. It shows that Danshensu can prevent atherosclerosis.<br>
Shi, Lin analyzed in the China Journal of Pharmacology (1990) the effects of PNS on the synthesis of PGI2 on the arterial wall and on platelet TXA2 content in mice by using radioimmunoassay. Results were ig PNS 25, 50, lOOmg/kg for 10 days continuously. Arterial PGI2 decreased, showing that there may be a relationship between the inbalance of PGI-TXA2, increased arterial PGI2. and the anti-AS functions of PNS.<br>
Hu, Yuejuan (1992) reported in the China Journal of Chinese<br>
Masteria Medica that coarse extraction of Panax Notoginseng i.p.<br>
can enhance mice's hypoxia tolerance, improve blood circulation<br>
90<br><br>
and slow heart rate. It can counteract noradrenaline contraction of the main artery and relieve the spasms in the smooth muscles of the intestine. Mice stomach-reperfused with SCC powder suspension exhibit shortened bleeding and coagulation times. The above pharmaceutical reactivity .of SCC is the same as Panax Notoginseng.<br>
Xu, Qing (1993) reported in the China Journal of Chinese Maeteria Medica on an experiment using Panax Notoginseng leaves gross saponin 200mg/kg, 100 mg/kg to perfuse two kinds of high-fat animals: rats and quail, for 7 days. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels of the animals were greatly lowered.<br>
Sun, Jianjun, etal. (1994) reported in the Journal of Traditional and Herbal Drugs that the condition of patients with angina pectoris did not improve satisfactorily with traditional Chinese medicine, which typically removes blood stasis and promotes blood flow, with nitrate, or with ■ Propranolol, and other medicine. However, after taking Panax Notoginseng together with those medications, or Panax Notoginseng alone, 10 out of 11 patients showed satisfactory progress after a one-month treatment.<br>
Jiang, Wende (1979) reported in Acta Pharmaceutica Sinica that using a 0.5g/tablet of borneol to infuse the stomach of anesthetized dogs with acute myocardial infarction caused by blockage of the coronary artery can slow heartbeat and reduce the difference between the oxygen content in the arteries and the veins. It can also lengthen hypoxia tolerance time in mice.<br>

The following is a description of the animal experiments and clinical research explaining the effects of DSP.<br>
D3P Animal Experiment Research<br>
1. The effects of myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, blood flow on related coronary arteries, myocardial oxygen consumption, and blood biochemical standards of anesthetized<br>
dogs .<br>
93<br><br>
The effects of DSP on dogs with myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction were observed. Based on changes in myocardial oxygen consumption and biochemical standards, its pharmaceutical effects on curing coronary heart disease were investigated.<br>
1.1	Experimental groups. (1) Blank control group, normal saline 3ml/kg; (2) DSP group, 2g natural drug/kg; (3) positive control .group, Ditiazem, 5mg/kg. All the above samples are diluted with normal saline to the same volume of 3ml/kg and were given to the patient through the duodenum.<br>
1.2	Experimental method. The dogs are anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium. Chests were opened and coronary arterioles and the central part of the dorsal lower branch separated and tied to create an acute myocardial ischemia model. ECGs were recorded and the level of myocardial ischemia (increased section ST, ST) and area of myocardial ischemia (the total increased decimal places in section ST) were calculated. The oxygen content in the coronary artery was recorded. Blood serum creatine kinase (CK) , lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ET, TXB2 and 6-Keto-PGFl were<br>
measured. The oxygen content of the aorta and coronary vein, and blood flow volume in the coronary arteries were measured to calculate myocardial oxygen consumption. Blood oxygen content in the coronary vein was measured to calculate myocardial oxygen content (myocardial oxygen content= (blood oxygen content in arteries-blood oxygen content in coronary veins) x blood flow volume in coronary artery/ 100).<br>
The hearts were removed 180 mins after treatment and weighed, cut into slices, and colored with N-BT. The infarction area of each slice (N-BT-uncolorized area) and non-infarction area (N-BT colorized area) were measured. The percentage occupied by the infarction area in the ventricles was calculated and the whole heart was weighted.<br>
The significance of the experimental results was tested by the t-testing method.<br>
94<br><br>
Results<br>
1.	Effects and area of myocardial ischemia of dogs. When compared with the control group, DSP can significantly reduce the scope and area of myocardial ischemia. See Tables 1.1 and 1.2.<br>
2.	Effects on the scope of myocardial infarction of dogs. When compared with the control group, DSP can significantly reduce the area of infarction. See Table 1.3.<br>
3.	Effects on venous blood oxygen content in dogs with myocardial ischemia. When compared with the control group, DSP can increase coronary venous blood oxygen content. See Table .1.4.<br>
4.	Effects on blood flow standards in dogs with myocardial ischemia. When compared with the control group, DSP can suppress the rise of CK and LDH which are caused by myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction, release ET and TXB2, and raise 6-Keto-PGF content. See Tables 1.5, 1.6, 1.7. Conclusions<br>
DSP can significantly improve myocardial ischemia and myocardial infarction, raise the blood oxygen level of venous sinuses, inhibit the release of CK and LDH caused by damage to cardiac muscles, lower the activity of blood serum CK and LDH, suppress the activity of blood vessel substances, ET and TXB2, and raise the 6-Keto-PGFl/TXB2 ratio.<br>

2. The protection of myocardial ischemical reperfusion injury from hypoxia in rats<br>
This research stresses the effects of Dan Shen Pill in myocardial ischemical reperfusion injury from hypoxia in rats, especially on the apoptosis of myocardial cells.<br>
1.	Animal models. Wistars are male rats. They were given anesthesia, and their chests were opened while they continued breathing. The coronary artery was tied at the conical area between the left atrium and the pulmonary artery.<br>
2.	Methods. The rats were assigned to 5 random groups: a) Sham-operated control. Perfuse the normal saline to the stomach, 1ml/ day, 4 days in total, b) Myocardial ischemia reperfusion (M-IR) . The same reperfusion method as above, c) Dissolve the compound Dan Shen Pill I (DSPI) 150ml/kg/day in 1ml of normal saline. Infuse the stomach (the same method as above) . d) Dan Shen Pill II (DSPII), 300ml/kg/day.<br>
The other specifications are the same as those used with DSP I . e) Dan Shen Pill (DSPIII), 4 5 Oml/kg/day. Theother specifications are the same as those used with DSPI.<br>
Testing Standard:<br>
2.1	Testing of myocardial infarction area. The left coronary artery was retied before the rat died. The auricles were removed after priming with 1% of Evan's Blue and bleached with PBS. They were kept in ice for 1h. After removing the unnecessary cells, they were colored in 1% TTC for 30min(37°C) . The myocardial hypoxia emergency area (Uncolored Evan's blue Area) and infarction area (Uncolored TTC Area) were calculated by weighing,<br>
2.2	Testing and Analysis of in-situ labeling of myocardial apoptotic cells. 3 slices of flesh were taken from 3 different parts of each of the hearts. The 3'-OH end of DNA in the nuclei of the myocardial apoptotic cells was labeled with nicked-end TdT ■ isomerase by TdT-mediate flourescein-duTP nick-end labeling, TUNEL. 5 different views were chosen. 300 positive cells inside the myocardial cells in each view were counted. The average positive cell count percentage was<br>
106<br><br>
used as the apoptotic index, AI.<br>
Results<br>
Change in myocardial infarction area. Myocardial infarction did not occur after 7 hrs of sham operation. Myocardial hypoxia occurred for 1 hr and myocardial infarction occurred sharply after reperfusing for 6 hrs. DSP can reduce the M-IR area and increase the effects with increasing dosage. Myocardial infarction area was minimized as shown in the following Table 2.1.<br>
Table 2.1 Changes of myocardial infarction area'in different<br>
groups	<br><br>
Notes:   Comparison with M-IR group,   *P
3.2 Change in myocardial apoptotic cells. Comparatively large amounts of DSP can sharply reduce the number of M-IR apoptotic cells, and AI  drops with increasing dosage of DSP,   as  shown in Table 2.2.<br>

Conclusion<br>
This research proves that DSP could sharply minimize the myocardial infarction area in the M-IR group of rats . This further shows that DSP can do a good job of protecting the myocardial cells of the M-IR group.<br>
3. Propagation of myocardial hypoxia in mice and effects of Fas/FasL proteins under deoxygenation and deoxygenation/re-oxygenation conditions<br>
Fas gene is an apoptosis-stimulating gene. Its expressed protein product, Fas antigen, is a cell membrane protein. Recently, it was discovered, in experiments on propagation of myocardial hypoxia, that there is a close relationship between the expressed mRNA of Fas gene and myocardial apoptosis. FasL is the ligand of Fas. It is on the surface of transmembrane proteins, which is homologous to the TNF. It can bind to the receptor Fas on the surface of the cell and give out the death signal.<br>
1.	Method. The myocardial cells of newborn mice were propagated<br>
normally. Hypoxia and deoxygenation/re-oxygenation testing was<br>
carried out after 24 hrs of propagation. The change in Fas/FasL<br>
protein expression level was then tested by the secondary immune<br>
system.<br>
2.	Results<br>
1. Change in Fas/FasL protein expression in the group with hypoxia for 4.5hrs, group with hypoxia for 30 mins, and group with re-oxygenation for 4hrs . The Fas/FasL protein expressions of both groups increased sharply compared with the control one. Protein expression of the Fas/FasL of DSP-protected group dropped more dramatically than the unprotected one, as shown in Table 3.1.<br>
2 . Change in Fas/FasL protein expression in the group with hypoxia for 10.5hrs, group with hypoxia for 30 mins, and group with re-oxygenation for lOhrs. The Fas/FasL protein expressions of both groups increased sharply compared with the control. The<br>
108<br><br>
protein expression of the Fas/FasL of the DSP-protected group dropped more dramatically than the unprotected one, as shown in Table 3.2.<br>
3 . There is more likely an increasing trend to the Fas/FasL protein expression in the group with hypoxia for 10.5hrs than in the group with hypoxia for 4 .5 hrs, but there is no major difference between them.<br>
4.	There was no major difference between the group with<br>
re-oxygenation for lO.Shrs and the group with re-oxygenation for<br>
4.5 hours.<br>
5.	There was a correlation in the protein expression of Fas/FasL.<br>
The above results show DSP can reduce apoptosis by interfering with Fas/FasL expression, protecting the cells from damage by hypoxia and deoxygenation/re-oxygenation.<br>

4.  Effects on lipidemia and atherosclerosis in rabbits<br>
1 .  Method<br>
1.1	Experimental groups. (1) Normal control group(8 rabbits): normal feeding; (2) High-fats group: High-fats feeding. All were fed for 4 weeks . Weight and lipoprotein in the blood were measured. The high-fats group was divided into 4 sub-groups (12 rabbits in each sub-group). 1. High-fats control group, 2. High-dosage of DSP group (4g dosage/kg/day), 3. Low-dosage DSP group (2g dosage/kg/day), and 4. Simvastatin group (lmg/kg/day). All are given distilled water except those with special prescriptions and ends after 12 weeks testing.<br>
1.2	Experimental Methods and Standards. (1) Examination of Aortic Lesion. Drugs were given to the animals for 8 weeks, and then the animals were killed. The aortas were removed and the unnecessary membranes and fats discarded. The aortas were cut open along the mid line. One-fifth of the aorta was removed for lipid examination. The remaining part was colored by Sudan III and used to calculate the spotting plate area and the total area of the aorta. The percentage of the lesion part was calculated, and a grading was given. The aorta was positionally cut to make<br>
110<br><br>
paraffin slices. It was colored by HE. The average thickness of the interior membrane spot plates was measured by microscopic parameter. (2) Examination of coronary artery lesion. The lower 0.4cm of the coronary artery colpus and 0.8cm of the apex cordis were transected to make 3 small plates. Sudan III colorization was carried out. The number of blood vessels with spot plates in the coronary artery and the lesion percentage (lesion percentage = the number of blood vessels with lesion / the total number of blood vessels in each transect X100%) were observed, calculated and graded according to the blocking of the blood vessels with spot plates. The average points were calculated by accumulation .<br>
Results<br>
(1) Effects on lipoprotein in blood serum of rabbits. The testing showed that the markings are lower than that of the high-fats group 2, 4, 8 weeks after taking DSP, as shown in Table 4.1.<br>
'-) Aorta AS area. It was observed that the interior membrane of the aorta was smooth and shiny without AS spot plates or streaks. The aortic lesion area percentage of the group with DSP protection was obviously smaller than that of the high-fats group (P

can damage the structure of the cell membrane so seriously that heart and liver tissues are damaged. SOD has an effective action of clearance on superoxide anions. It can regulate the oxidation reaction controlled by free radicals. DSP can increase SOD activity, decrease MDA content, lower the oxidation standard, and reduce the level of damage to the organs. 6. Effects on cardiac arrhythmia caused by exogenous free radicals<br>
Langendorff perfusion device was used to pour ferrous sulfate (0.25mmol/L)/citrate (l.Ommol/L) into the Wistar rat's artificial heart. The model of free radicals causing heart rhythm irregularity was replicated to observe the effects of DSP.<br>

7. Clinical applications for acute pancreatitis in rats<br>
This experiment uses the acute pancreatitis model with multi-organ malfunction in rats to show the change in the blood plasma endothelins and the clinical applications of DSP.<br>
1.	Experimental groups<br>
Classical reverse bile duct vaccination was used to create the<br>
acute pancreatitis model. The animal used was a Wistar Rat.<br>
(1) Normal control group (Control group) : The bile duct was not tied. The abdomen was cut open and immediately closed after the pancreas was removed. Normal saline(5ml/kg) was injected subcutaneously 30 mins before the operation and 2 hrs after operation. Animals were killed 12 hrs after operation.<br>
(2 )  Saline treatment group (Saline group) : Normal saline (5ml/kg) was injected subsutaneously 30 mins before the model was created and 2 hrs after creation. Animals were killed 12 hrs after the model was created.<br>
(3) DSP treatment group (DSP group): DSP (400mg/kg) • was reperfused into the stomach 30 mins before the model was created and 2 hrs after creation. Animals were killed 12 hrs after the model was created.<br>
2.	Results<br>

Conclusion<br>
The increasing of cAMP inhibits the activity of phosphoesterase and epoxidase, and reduces the production of prostaglandin peroxide. It can also activate protease to phosphoesterize the membrane protein, alter the effects of membrane protein composition on platelet aggregation, and control platelet aggregation to prevent thrombosis. DSP can increase blood platelet concentration and plasma camp content in order to prevent thrombosis.<br>
9. Effects of DSP on blood vessels and nerve lesion in diabetic rats<br>
Method. 38 3D rats are divided into normal control group, model group and DSP group, at random. The diabetic rat model is made by abdominally injecting STZ60mg/kg. DSP (0.25/kg.d-1) was mixed into the normal feeding of the DSP group. The model group and normal control group were given normal feedings. The experiment<br>
122<br><br>
lasted for 6 months. Total cholesterol (TC), High density Lipoprotein-c (HDL-c), and Low-density lipoprotein-c (LDL-c) were measured using U.S. Berer testing. Triglycerides (TG) used acetylacetone colorimetry. The Plasma Nitrogen Monoxide(NO)was measured by Fluorescence Spectrophotometry, and Propandiol (MDA) was measured by TBA colorimetry. (GSH-PX) used the DTNB method. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) , plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAD, DD, FDP were tested by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Insulin Radioimmunoassay and Glycated Hemoglobin (HbAic) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Contraves low share 30 was used to test blood flow (made in Switzerland).<br>
Results. After 6 months, the protein content of the 24-hr DSP group was much lower (45% lower) than that of the model group (P0.05), as shown in Table 9.1. The PAI, DD and FDP of the model group and DSP group were much higher than that of the normal control group (P0.05) .<br>
Conclusion. DSP cannot thoroughly protect blood vessels and nerves or prevent the occurrence of blood vessel and nerve lesion in diabetic rats, but it can relieve or reduce its occurrence in the 6 months-diabetic rat, especially in terms of protein in the urine and lesion of blood capillaries of the kidneys and retina. This may be related to the function of DSP, which can increase thrombolysis.<br>

In conclusion, DSP can increase blood flow to the coronary artery;<br>
relax the smooth muscles in blood vessels; activate peripheral<br>
circulation; raise venous oxygen content; significantly improve<br>
acute myocardial infarction; reduce apoptosis by interfering<br>
with Fas/FasL, protein expression to protect the cells from damage<br>

by hypoxia and deoxygenation/re-oxygenation; improve circulation; and protect myocardial tissue. It can also prevent cardiac arrhythmia and platelete aggregation; activate thrombolysis; reduce blood viscosity; adjust lipoprotein levels; prevent atherosclerosis; increase tolerence to hypoxia; prevent oxidation of fats; remove harmful free radicals; reduce ET content in blood plasma; and improve the liver, kidney and pancreas function to prevent the occurrence of blood vessel and nerve lesion.<br>
Clinical Research on Dan Shen Pill<br>
1. Treatment of coronary heart disease with DSP<br>
(1) Ordinary treatment of coronary heart disease with DSP After DSP came onto the market in China, a large-scale clinical research project was conducted in China. Although different prescriptions were used in different research projects,. all conclusions are written according to "Method of DSP clinic study."All clinical and experimental markers were standardized. A simplified summary of the results is shown below in Table 1-1.<br><br>
125<br>

Note: The numbers inside the [] represent the pain-killing function<br>
and improvement in ECG results.<br>
Comparison with normal control group,  *p
(1)	Numbers in the ( ) in order of appearance are: sample number, angina improvement after treatment and percentage improvement in ECG after treatment.<br>
(2)	The standard markers were cardiac output (CO) , stroke volume (SV) , Ejection fractin(EF),(FS), (3 platelet microglobulin, Thromboxane p2, Holter Test for ST-T changing times, etc.<br>
(3)	The standard markers were Heart Ratio(HR), systolic pressure (SBP), (Product), diastolic pressure (DBP) , output (SV) per pulse, cardiac output (CO), cardiac Index(CI), ejection fration(EF), angina onset frequency, and dosage of glyceryl trinitrate.<br>
(4)	This was a cross companion test, so there is no statistical difference between the medicine in the angina group and in the ECG group.<br>
According to Table 1-1, the effects of DSP on the treatment of coronary heart disease are much better than that of DSS,<br>
126<br><br>
statistically. The treatment is basically similar to that of Isordil and there is no significant difference between them statistically.  DSP is a pure Chinese medicine.  It works efficiently  in  small  dosages..  It  is  convenient,  safe, easily-absorbed, and has no side effects.<br>
(2) Pain-killing effects of DSP on coronary heart disease compared with glyceryl trinitrate. The pain-killing function of DSP  for coronary heart  disease is  discussed.<br>
1.	Example. 132 patients with coronary heart diseases were selected. They were divided into 2 random groups, 102 patients in the treatment group and 30 patients in the control group. They were classified according to Chinese Medical Method into: 42 patients in the Qizhi Xueyu treatment group, 24 patients in the Tanshi Bizhu treatment group, 7 patients in the Yangxu Hanning treatment group, 29 patients in the Qiyin Liangxu and Xueyu treatment group; andU, 7, 2, and 10 patients, respectively, were assigned to the control groups.<br>
2.	Method. An ECG was conducted once before the pain begins. Patients in the treatment group took 10 DSP during the pain, while those in the control group took 0.5mg glyceryl trinitrate. The time it took for the pain to end was recorded and used as a reference. An ECG was conducted again 30 mins after treatment and compared it with the one taken before.<br>
3.	Standard. Three pain-killing standards were established: obvious effectiveness - pain ended 3 minutes after treatment; effectiveness- pain ended 3~8 minutes after treatment; and Failure-pain ended 8 hrs or more after treatment.<br>
Results<br>
(1) Speedy Painkilling. The obvious effectiveness of the treatment group was 4.0.20%, and the total efficacy was 88.28%. The obvious effectiveness of the control group was 53.33%, and total efficacy was 93,. 33%. There was no significant difference between the two groups (p&gt;0.05) . These two groups have a similar<br>

Conclusion<br>
The above experiment shows that the effects of DSP treatment on<br>
for coronary heart disease is similar to that of glyceryl<br>
trinitrate. The results of both ECGs are similar 30 mins after<br>
treatment, and the Chinese classification of coronary heart<br>
disease does not affect the efficacy of DSP.<br>
(3)  Effects of DSP on the onset of coronary heart disease, heart<br>
pain frequency and volume of glyceryl trinitrate used.<br>
1.	Sample selection. Samples were selected according to WHO clinical standards. Patients must have exhibited least exertion-related angina pectoris for 3 months. Onset frequency was more than 5 times a week with positive results in exercise tests and pain relieved by rest or oral glyceryl trinitrate. The total number in the sample was 64.<br>
2.	Method of research. The research was divided into two periods at random using the double-blind method. The first period (cleansing period)lasted 2 weeks. All medications except for glyceryl trinitrate were stopped. The second period lasted 8 weeks, and 10-15 DSP were given to one group, 3 times p,&amp;$. week, while 10-15mg of Isordil was given to another group, 3 tinv^s a week.<br>
3.	Results. Onset frequency of the DSP-protected group decreased from 1.93 + 3.10 to 0.48 + 1.33 with a statistical error of P

The results show that DSP can reduce onset frequency and volume of glyceryl trinitrate used. The level and duration of pain improved after a certain period of treatment, and the onset frequency also decreased. This explains why DSP can improve blood flow to the heart in addition to relieving pain.<br>

By comparing DSP and well-known pain medication Isordil, DSP's<br>
clinical treatment effects and toxic side effects are discussed.<br>
1.   Objects and Methods<br>
1.1 Sample. The total number of patients with steady angina pectoris was 109. They all  qualified under WHO Standard Cardiac function Category I ~ II , 1979. They were divided into two groups at random: 57 in the treatment group and 52 in the Isordil group (control group).<br>

Conclusion<br>
Long-term DSP treatment is more efficient and yields better ECG results than Isordil treatment. The results are stable, and there is no antibiotic resistance. Isordil can efficiently lower blood pressure, leading to the activation of endogenous nerve and body fluid system and an increase in blood volume. In addition, Isordil works on sulfur radicals inside the capillary wall, but it would consume sulfur radicals in the long term and reduce treatment effects. DSP is a multi-level, multi-subjected and multi-method medicine which improve cardiac muscle, increases blood volume by blocking the chronic calcium route; stabilizes the myocardial membrane; removes free radials; regulates myocardial cells metabolism; improves blood platelets aggregation; and lowers cholesterol and blood viscosity. Therefore, long-term DSP treatment gives significant treatment effects. (7)  Treatment of unstable-type angina<br>
Clinical research on the effects o.f DSP on unstable-type angina. 1.   Subjects and Methods<br>
1.2	Sample: 65 patients with unstable-type angina were divided<br>
into two groups at random: 34 in the treatment' group, which<br>
includes 22 males and 12 females; 31 in the control group<br>
which includes 20 males and 11 females.<br>
1.3	Method. Two groups of patients were injected normally with<br>
30ml of DSP, Qd, 80mg oral aspirin, Qd. Patients in the<br>
treatment group were given DSP, 10 tablets/day, 3 times/day;<br>
Isordil was given to those in the control group, lOmg/time,<br>
3 times/day. The medication lasted for 20 days. No coronary<br>
artery-dilating and fat-lowering drugs were given. If pain<br>
worsened, glyceryl trinitrate was given.<br>

by cardiac muscles, improve blood flow in coronary arteries, rebalance oxygen demand-to-oxygen supply ratio in cardiac muscles.<br>
The effects of DSP on treatment of exertion-type of angina on 60 additional patients.<br>
1.	Sample selection. 60 patients in total, including 42 males and 18 females, aged 32-75, with an average age of 52.2, and positive results in the Plane Exercise Test were selected.<br>
2.	Method of medication. DSP was given, under lingua, 10 tablets/ medication, 3 times /day. The medication lasted for 6 weeks.<br>
3.	Results. Refer to the 1.997 CHD Angina Standard.<br><br>
(1)	Efficacy. No occurrence of angina, 21 patients with increased physical tolerance (35%), 15 patients with negative results in the Plane Exercise Test  (25%) .<br>
(2)	Improvement. 29 patients with a two-thirds decrease in the frequency of onset of pain or shortening of the duration of pain (48.3%), 28 patients with suspicious positive results in the Plane Exercise Test (46.5%).<br>
(3)	Failure. 10 patients had no change in onset frequency and duration (16.7%) . 17 patients had positive results in the<br>
Plane Exercise Test (28.3%) .<br>
Conclusion<br>
DSP can efficiently relieve pain and increase blood flow to the cardiac muscle. DSP can also reduce oxygen consumption, improve blood flow to the coronary artery, rebalance oxygen demand and oxygen supply, and prevent atherosclerosis. It is the ideal medicine for the prevention or treatment of coronary heart disease, angina and atherosclerosis.<br>
(8)  Research on senior group angina<br>
Both DSP and Nifedipine can treat angina caused by coronary heart<br>
disease, but the latter has side effects which are not suitable<br>
  139<br><br>
for long-term use. In order to choose suitable drugs for patients with a need for long-term treatment of coronary heart disease, a comparative analysis of DSP and Nifedipine in the treatment of angina caused by coronary heart disease was carried out.<br>
1.	Materials and Methods<br>
1.1	Subjects. 50 senior patients with coronary heart disease were divided into two groups: 30 in the DSP group (Treatment group) , 20 in the Nifedipine group (Control gro.up) . Patients in both groups did not have significant differences in terms of sex, age, medication, and Chinese medical classification, but a comparison of the differences is worthwhile.<br>
1.2	Method. DSP was given to the Treatment group, 10-15 tablets/medication, 3 times/day; Nifedipine was given to the Control group, 10~15mg / medication, 3 times/day. Medications were taken for 30 days. Patients in both groups used Yongbaoling spray under their tongues during acute onset of symptoms . Other medications with no obvious effects were used during the treatment process.<br>
1.3	Types of tests. Onset frequency, duration, number of times Yongbaoling was sprayed each day, 12-lead ECG, blood pressure, heartbeat, normal blood urea, liver and kidneys function, and lipoproteins in blood and blood viscosity both before and after treatment.<br>
1.4	Statistical analysis. The results were measured by t statistic testing, calculated by x2 statistic testing.<br>
2.	Confirmation of results. Onset frequency and duration with<br>
a decrease of 80% or more was regarded as obvious efficacy.<br>
A decrease of 50% or more was regarded as efficacy. A decrease<br>
of 50% or less was regarded as a failure. Changes in NST<br>
and EST before and after treatment were used to observe ECG<br>
improvement. NST represented the low-pressure 12-lead<br>
numbers in section ST; EST represented the sum of all low<br>
pressure numbers in section ST of 12-lead.<br>

3.3	Side-effects: 3 patients in the Nifedipine group felt<br>
pain, 2 had swollen ankles, 1 had slow heartbeat. There was no<br>
damage to liver and kidney function, adverse gastrointestinal<br>
reaction or cardiac arrhythmia in the treatment group.<br>
Conclusion<br>
DSP is made for angina. It activates blood circulation and relieves pain efficiently. Its effects are long lasting, require only a small dosage and have no side effects. Nifedipine is a short-term-effective calcium antagonist with a short half-life<br>
141<br><br>
and functional time, so angina may occur during medication. It also has many side effects. Many reports state that long-term treatment with Nifedipine is harmful to coronary arteries. DSP can prevent decreased blood flow to the cardiac muscles and the development of atherosclerosis.<br>
(9) Effects on non-symptomatic M-IR<br>
1.	Clinical sample. 52 patients were in the treatment group, which included 39 patients with coronary heart disease, and 4 patients with M-IR, and 9 patients with positive results on the exercise test. There were 38 males and 14 females. 52 patients were in the control group, which included 43 patients with coronary heart disease, 6 patients with M-IR, and 3 patients with positive results on the exercise test. There were 34 males and 18 females (Both groups followed the WHO M-IR-Related Heart Disease and Standard established in 1979).<br>
2.	Method of treatment. DSP was given to the treatment group, 10 tablots/medication, 3 times/day. Nifedipine was given to the control group, 10 mg/medication, 3 times/day. Both medications iasted for 4 weeks, and all medications related to the treatment of M-IR were stopped.<br>
3.	Result standard. Efficient: Change of ECG ST-T was close to normal; Better: Decreased section ST rose 0.5mm or more, transverse wave T changed to vertical ones, inverted wave changed 25% or more, conducting resistance was improved; Failure: There was no difference in ECGs before and after treatment.<br>
Results<br>
(1) Efficacy in both the DSP group and the Nifedipine control group increased as treatment progressed, as shown in Table 1-16. There was a significant difference between the groups (P

Conclusion<br>
The treatment effects of DSP on cardiac arrhythmia caused by coronary heart disease are significant. It is also helpful to those patients without heart disease. Its functions are: a) Calcification. DSP can reduce intracellular calcium concentration and prevent calcium overloading better than verapamil. B) Stabilizing the cell membrane. DSP can protect cardiac muscle and regulate heart rhythm, c) Removal of free radicals. D) Speeding up energy production and utilization. There is no relationship between chronic irregularity of heart rhythm and the addition of resistance and lack of energy supply.<br>
(2) Long-term effects on irregularity of heart rhythm caused by myocarditis and cardiac functions<br>
1.	Clinical samples. 120 patients with myocarditis were selected according to Whole Country Myocarditis Conference Standards, 1995. Patients took their own regular medication for one month and then were randomly divided into two groups with 60 patients per group. The DSP group (Treatment group) included 33 males and 27 females. The Di'ao Xinxuekang group (Control group) included 31 males and 29 females.<br>
2.	Method of treatment. DSP was given to the Treatment group, 10 tablets/medication, 3 times/day orally. Di'ao Xinxuekang Jiaonang was given to the Control group(made by the pharmaceutical factory of Chengdu Bio-tech Research Institute, Chinese Science Institute ) , 200mg/medication, 3 times/day orally. Both medications lasted 2-6 months.<br>
Results<br>
(1) Symptoms of both groups. There was significant improvement in palpitation, sense of suffocation, and difficulty breathing in both groups after treatment. The total clinical efficiencies of the treatment group and the control were 93% and 73%, respectively, as shown in Table 2-3.<br>

DSP and Di'ao Xinxuekang can both improve cardiac arrhythmia caused by myocarditis and heart malfunction, but DSP does a better job than Di'ao Xinxuekang. DSP can improve blood flow to the cardiac muscles, section ST and T wave in ECGs. In additoin, DSP can also reduce platelet aggregation, and platelet viscosity. The results show that patients who take DSP in the long term enjoy relief from symptoms and low reoccurrence of myocarditis.<br>
3 . Reverse function of DSP on Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (LVH)<br>
This experiment explored the reverse function of DSP on LVH. 1. Subject and Method<br>
1.1	Sample selection. All patients were selected from clinics<br>
and hospitals and do not have high blood pressure, coronary heart<br>
disease, myocardial disease, diabetes, or other heart diseases.<br>
LVH was confirmed by ultrasonic ECG. The patients were divided<br>
into two groups at random: 34 patients in the treatment group,<br>
including 21 males and 13 females; 20 patients in the control<br>
group, including 12 males and 8 females. There was no difference<br>
in age, sex, and medication in the two groups.<br>
1.2	Method. DSP was given to the treatment group, 10<br>
tablets/medication, 3 times/day. 50mg Meiduoxin'an was given to<br>
the control group, 3 times/day. Each medication lasted 6-12<br>
months. Other blood vessel medications were stopped during<br>
treatment. For comparison, the two groups were checked and<br>
results logged before and after treatment.<br>
1.3	Types of measurements and standards. The heart ultrasound<br>
was checked by color doppler. The dilated Left Ventricular<br>
Interior Diameter (LVID) was measured. Interventricular septum<br>
thickness (IVST) and Left Ventricular Posterior Wall Thickness<br>
(LVPWT) were measured and calculated : Left Ventricular Mass (LVM)<br>

The above experiment shows that DSP prevents damage caused by free radicals, prevents atherosclerosis, improves blood circulation, decreases blood viscosity and exterior blood vessel resistance, and regulates compliance of cardiac muscles to<br>
reverse LVH.<br>
4 .   DSP treatment for high blood pressure<br>
(1) Effects on structure and functions of heart in patients with high blood pressure and coronary heart disease<br>
1.	Subject, 140 patients with high blood pressure and coronary heart disease for 4-15 years were selected. The ratio of males to females is 5:1.<br>
2.	Method. No angina- and blood pressure-lowering medications were taken 1 week before treatment. A placebo was taken 3 times /day for 1 week, followed by 10 DSP tablets, 3 times/day. Each medication was taken for 8 weeks.<br>
3.	Standards. Static ECG, blood pressure, heartbeat, clinical symptoms and other undesirable responses; the levels of: Epinephrine (E) , Non-Epinephrine (NE) , Atrial Natriuretic Factor (ANF), endothelins (ET), Nitrogen Monoxide (NO); the structure and functions of the Left Ventricle (Left Ventricular Dilated diameter, LVDd, Interventricular space, IVS, left ventricular posterior wall, PWT, and Left Ventricular Mass Index LVMI).<br>
4 .   Standards of measurement. The structure and function of the<br>
151<br><br>
left ventricle was measured by colored ultrasonic doppler, and the LDVd, IVS and PWT were found. LVMI was calculated according to the equation: LVMI= {1.04 [LDVd+ IVS+ PWT]3- 13.6} 2/ surface area, male &gt; 125g/m2 , female &gt; 110g/m2 are regarded as LVH. According to the Teichholz equation and the frequency of blood flow in the aorta, cardiac output (CO) and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated, and A peak velocity (DAV) , E peak velocity (DEV) and A/E ratio were measured according to the greatest blood flow through the biscupid valve. The above results were taken from the average value of 3 trials.<br>
5.   Statistics: Results are in terms of X±s. Using matching t statistic testing before and after treatment.<br>

3, Treatment of hyperlipidemia<br>
(1) Treatment of hyperlipidema<br>
Research into the treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis with DSP in comparison to low-dosage aspirin. 1.   Subject and Method<br>
1.1	Sample. 53 patients were divided into 2 groups, at random:<br>
25 patients in Treatment group (DSP group), and 28 patients in<br>
Control group (aspirin group).<br>
1.2	Method: DSP was given to the treatment group, 10 tablets/ day, 3 times/day. The medication lasted for 6 months . 50mg enteric aspirin was given to the Control group, 1 time/day orally.<br>
1.3	Standard. a) Measurement of IMT ( Arterial tunica intima-tunica media) . The horizontal and vertical transactions<br>
■r<br>
of the whole-length aorta, carotis communis, exterior artery, and subclavial artery were checked 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. The thickest part of the IMT was measured and recorded. b) Blood flow included whole blood high-viscosity (hHb), whole blood low-viscosity (hLb), plasma viscosity (hP), Aggregation Index of Red blood cells (AIR) etc. c) Measurement of blood lipoprotein included Total blood Cholesterol (TC) and Triglycerides (TG). D) Statistical treatment by matching t statistic testing.<br>

Symptoms disappeared if the medication was taken after meals. 1 patient suffered from a swollen head. The symptoms disappeared after continuous treatment.<br>
Conclusion<br>
DSP is safe and effective for senior patients with coronary heart<br>
disease with angina and high blood viscosity.<br>
6. Treatment for Hyperviscosity Syndrome (HS)<br>
Hyperviscosity Syndrome (HS) is a pathobiological concept, a syndrome caused by one or more blood viscosity factor(s). It can lead to lack of blood supply, hypoxia, blocking, etc. in the heart, brain and kidneys. DSP offers the best results in HS treatment.<br>
There were 41 patients in this experiment, including 23 males and 18 females, aged 39-68. The average age was 50.7. The primary disease in this group was II-phase hypertentive disease. 22 patients had hypertentive disease and hypertentive nephrosis, 9 had cerebral infraction, 13 had coronary heart disease; 19 patients had nephrotic syndrome. DSP was given, 10 tablets/medication, 3 times/day and the medication lasted for 4 weeks, t statistic testing was used for comparison before and after treatment.<br>
158<br><br>
Results<br>
After the normal 28 days of medication, HS symptoms such as nausea, lack of energy, breathholding, anxiety, etc. related to coronary heart disease, cerebral infraction, and kidney disease disappeared gradually. Blood pressure was lowered, and blood circulation improved. TC, TG, Apo-B dropped, and HDLC and Apo-Al rose. All levels of hemorheology markers dropped. Renal Blood flow increased, and renal function improved. Urine protein decreased, and cardiac improved. See Tables 6-1, 6-2, 6-3.<br>

Effects on blood serum troponin in patients with AMI<br>
1.	Subject. 56 patients with AMI, including 34 males and 22<br>
females, aged 40-70 were selected. Patients were divided in a<br>
1:1 ratio into two groups: 28 patients each in the treatment group<br>
and the control group. The Control group consisted of 40 healthy<br>
people tested at random, including 23 males and 17 females, aged<br>
42-73.<br>
2.	Method of medication. Treatment group: DSP was given, 10<br>
tablets, 3 times/day, for 2 weeks; Control group: Western medical<br>
treatment was used (i.e. absolute bed rest, oxygen intake,<br>
maintaining of the stool in a soft and smooth state) . The Control<br>
group also took lOmg Isordil orally, 3 times/d; 75mg enteric<br>
aspirin, 1 tirne/d, 12.5mg Kaibotong, 2 times/d, 5mg glyceryl<br>
Trinitrate + polarization solution, mild titration, 1 time/d.<br>
3.	Observation method. 2ml of blood was collected from the<br>
inferior vena cava of each patient 6 hrs, 12 hrs, 1 day, 3 days,<br>
5 days, 7 days, 9 days, 11 days, and 13 days after patients entered<br>
the hospital. The blood was tested by one-step sandwich enzyme<br>
immunoassay.<br>
Results<br>
(1)	The blood serum TnT concentration in a normal person should be evenly distributed, and the normal value should be 0.26+ 0.14ug/L. Those with values higher than 0.38ug/L were regarded as significantly increased.<br>
(2)	Results of blood serum TnT concentration in both groups at<br>
different onset times are shown in Table 7-1. TnT concentrations<br>
in the two groups were evenly distributed. The serum TnT in the<br>
160<br><br>
treatment group rose 3-6 hrs after onset, and reached its peak on the 47th day, maintained a high level for 9 days, then returned to normal on the 11th day. Serum TnT concentration in the Control group rose 4-6 hrs after onset, reached its peak on the 48th day, and maintained a high level for 10 days. It returned to normal on the 12th day.<br>

Conclusion: DSP can improve blood circulation by dilating coronary arteries, saving cardiac muscle, minimizing the infarction area, and protecting myocardial cells . Therefore, DSP<br>
161<br><br>
can protect cardiac muscles in the early stages of AMI. It is a convenient medication with no side effects, which is recommended in the clinical field.<br>
8. Effects on treatment of cerebral infarction<br>
Treatment of cerebral infarction<br>
All cases are confirmed by CT brain scan. Patients'were divided into random groups at a 2:1 ratio. The 102 patients in Group A were given DSP, 10 tablets/medication, once per 6 hrs through the nose and given additional treatments according to their level of illness. These additional treatments included dehydrating agents, anti-infectants, substances to maintain water and electrolyte balance, acupuncture, moxibustion, chirapsia, etc.). Group B received the same treatment except DSP. The medication lasted for 4 weeks in both groups.<br>
Treatment standards. Marks were given according to the level of neurologic impairment and according to clinical efficacy standards.<br>

9. Effects on blood micro-circulation<br>
Patients with coronary heart disease have a disorder of hemorheology not only in their systemic circulations, but also in different levels of micro-circulation. Recently, most patients with coronary heart disease have lower than half the normal renewal rate by micro-circulation standards. It shows that patients with coronary heart diseases also getmicro-circulation disorders . Nail wall or bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation are used as observation start points for examining total body micro-circulation.<br>
(1)	Effects on Nail wall micro-circulation. See Table 3-6.<br>
(2)	Effects on bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation Effects of DSP on patients with coronary heart disease, bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation and thrombo-elasticity chart.<br>
The effects of DSP on patients with coronary heart disease bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation and thrombo-elasticity chart by compared with Suxiao Jiuxin Wan are discussed.<br>
1. Sample. 120 patients are selected who have coronary heart disease and complain primarily of a congested feeling in their chests, who experience onset coronary heart disease-angina twice or more per week. They are divided into groups at random: a) 30 patients in the low-dosage DSP group, b) 30 patients in the medium-dosage DSP group, c) 30 patients in the high-dosage DSP group, d) 30 patients in the Suxiao Jiuxin Wan control group.<br>
163<br><br>
2.	Method. DSP and Suxiao Jiuxin Wan were taken orally.  The dosages are taken in the following order; 5 tablets/time, 10 tablets/time, 15 tablets/time, 10 tablets/time in the control group. No other unrelated medications are taken within 2 hrs after treatment. The bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation and thrombo-elasticity charts are checked after 2 hrs, then rechecked for changes in different standards of bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation at 10, 20, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 mins post treatment. Patients are checked for changes in thrombo-elasticity after 240 mins.<br>
3.	Standards: (1) testing of bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation: Using a multifunctional microscope, the state of bulbar conjunctiva micro-circulation of the temporal left eye is magnified 50 times and observed. Sharp blood flow is chosen, blood capillaries and veins are recorded. The diameter and blood flow velocity of blood capillaries and veins by the PC processing system of microcirculation image (MCMP) . Blood flow in capillary vessels is calculated, [blood flow volume= n X (diameter of blood vessel/2)2 X blood flow velocity]. All values used before treatment in both groups were counted as 100%.<br>
(2) Testing of thrombo-elasticity. Using the thrombo-elasticity chart, physical changes in platelet aggregation and their dissolving process are observed. The main standards were reaction time(r), aggregation time(k),the maximum amplitude of thrombo-elasticity chart (ma), and thrombolic cutting-velocity rate(G),<br>

11. Adjustment of vegetative nerve<br>
Adjustment of vegetative nerve<br>
in patients with Qizhi Xueyu-type coronary heart disease with<br>
angina.<br>
This test uses "Wenger-Chongzhongchongxiong" vegetative nerve balance factor analysis to test the heart rate variation (HRV), that is, the fluctuation in the average heartbeat over a certain period of time or over a long time period in the R-R period. Data, including effects on the sympathetic and para-sympathetic nerves can be calculated, to reflect the regulatory function of the vegetative nervous system.<br>
169<br><br>
1.	Sample selection: Patients must have had Qizhi Xueyu-type coronary heart disease with angina. Patients were divided into two groups at random. Treatment group: DSP was given, 10 tablets/medication, 3 times/day. Control group: Isordil was given, lOmg per dosage, 3 times/day. Each medication lasted for 1 month.<br>
2.	Standard. (1) The Vascular Nerve Balance Index was recorded before and after treatment as (y): . using the "Wenger-Chongzhongchongxiong", vegetative nerve balance factor analysis. y=0±0.56 is normal. When y&gt;+0.56 is abnormal, it shows that the function of the sympathetic nerve increases. When y
(2) Change in heartbeat before and after treatment (HRV) . 24 hrs continuous testing is done to check the ECG change. The standard deviation (SDNN) in the R-R period in 24 hrs is found. SDNN is used to represent the change in heartbeat.<br>
Results<br>
After DSP treatment, the percentage of y&gt;+0.56 dropped significantly (P+0.56 (P&gt;0.05). See Table 11-1. After DSP treatment, SDNN in R-R increased significantly (P0.05). See Table 11-2. A decrease in HRV means the sympathetic nerve is excited. It is directly proportional to the symptoms in coronary heart disease and the possibility of sudden death and irregularity of heartbeat. DSP can control over-excitement of the para-sympathetic nerve and regulate the balance in the vegetative nerve.<br>

13. The effectiveness of DSP therapy in diabetes and related complications<br>
(I)   DSP therapy improves diabetic disease in the elderly<br>
40 diabetic patients were included in the clinical trial. Their diagnoses met with the diabetic diagnosis standard setup by WHO in 1985. 21 of the patients were male, aged 70.2 + 8.4; 19 of them were female, aged 66.8+5.6. All had suffered from diabetes for 3-25 years with an average of 16.8 + 6 .4.25 patients also suffered from cardiovascular disease, 18 had cerebrovascular disease, 8 had nephrosis, 12 had neuropathy, 15 had eye disease, and 6 had other complications.<br>
Patients took DSP orally, twice per day, 10 tablets each time for 3 months. During the trial, their physical conditions were monitored by colligation monitoring meter for nail wall microcirculation, produced by Shanghai Laser Research Center.<br>
176<br><br>
The trial result reveal that after 3 months of taking DSP, the 40 patients' nail wall microcirculation test indexes had varying degrees of improvement. Their collective cumulative values decreased. Among the patients, those originally with serious abnormalities now had medium abnormality; those originally with medium abnormality had slight abnormalities. The differences before and after treatment were obvious. The differences are listed in the Tables 13-1 and 13-2:<br>

The cause of retinal vein occlusion is still not very clear. Hypertention, hyperlipidemia, and arteriosclerosis are usually considered as likely causes of retinal vein occlusion. Doctor of traditional Chinese medicine believes that it is caused by stagnant blood flow. DSP can activate blood circulation and relieve congestion, improve microcirculation, relieve hydropsy, and encourage blood absorption. In so doing, it can improve eyesight. DSP can also be used to heal different kinds of optical fundus vascular diseases that are generally termed as Xueyuzheng, such as central retinal artery occlusion, hypertensive retinal arteriosclerosis, diatetic retinal lesion, central plasm optic neuropathy, central permeation optic neuropathy, ischemic optic neuropathy, optic neuritis, atrophy of the optic nerve, etc.<br>

(5)   Treatment of damaged lateral malleolus joint There were 53 males and 34 females in this experiment, ages 14-60. All cases were selected according to external injury and typical clinical symptoms after x-ray photography to eliminate cases of broken bone.<br>
Treatment method: 30 tablets of ground DSP with 30ml of 75% ethanol were mixed to a solution for external use. It was applied to the injured area 3 times a day with normal medication for 5 days.<br>
Results<br>
After DSP treatment, patients felt symptoms disappear and joint and ligament function recover. There were no obvious pressure pain spots. 42 patients recovered after 1 treatment, 37 patients recovered after 2 treatments, and 8 patients recovered after 3 treatements.<br>
DSP can eliminate swelling and stagnant blood, and can kill pain. Among their active ingredient borneol can increase its absorption through the skin and maintain concentrations of the drugs at the application site, so it can efficiently and quickly treat damage of the lateral malleolus joint. It is helpful in treating broken bones, bone death and proliferation of bone.<br>
(5) Prevention ancj treatment of plateau hypoxia Plateau hypoxia can lead to capillary circulation disorder, causing blood perfusing insufficiency. Plateau hypoxia also leads to high blood viscosity, increased red blood cell quantity and red blood cell aggregation, enhanced red blood cell rigidity, increased platelet aggregation, and change in pH value. All the above : ,v.-v.ors a;: feet blood viscosity and the radius of capillaries. Platelet aggregation can increase resistance in capillaries, leading to blockage. When blood viscosity increases, the racnus of capillaries also increases and leads to increased resistance and congestion. There are common properties in the blood flow of people with plateau hypoxia: "concentration"<br>
194<br><br>
(increased red blood cell pressure) , "viscosity" (increased whole blood viscosity), "aggregation" (increased aggregation of red blood cells) . All the above are different at different sea levels and durations. Forementioned pharmaphysiologic and clinical research show that DSP can lower hematocrit, blood sedimentation and blood viscosity, so it is helpful in preventing and treating plateau hypoxia.<br>
