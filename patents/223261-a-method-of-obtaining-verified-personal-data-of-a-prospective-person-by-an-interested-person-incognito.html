A METHOD OF OBTAINING VERIFIED PERSONAL DATA OF A PROSPECTIVE PERSON, WITH THE CONSENT OF THE PROSPECTIVE PERSON BY AN INTERESTED PERSON INCOGNITO, THROUGH A NETWORK SYSTEM HAVING A DATABASE CONTAINING PROFILES OF PROSPECTIVE PERSONS.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of obtaining verified personal data of a prospective person, with the consent of the prospective person by an interested person incognito, through a network system having a database containing profiles of prospective persons.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many matrimonial portals are available online over the internet. The organizations that provide this service maintain a database containing information about the potential brides and grooms, registered with them. This information pertaining to the members is maintained in the form of profiles created for each one of them. Member profile contains some basic personal information such as the members name, age, sex<br><br>
religion etc. The profiles are open to public viewing and can be accessed with the help of a simple query combination, based on the interest of the person searching the database. In order to access the services provided by the matrimonial portal, an interested person has to register first. Once registered, he or she is allowed to access the services. If the interested person comes across the profile of a prospective person having requisite profile then he or she can initiate contact with that particular person having the interesting profile. The drawback of this approach is that there is no way of knowing whether the information that is given in the profiles is true or not. The interested person will not be able to verify whether the prospective person whom he or she is trying to contact is genuine or not. In order to overcome this drawback, the present invention discloses a method of obtaining verified personal data of a prospective person, with the consent of the prospective person by an interested person incognito through a network having a database containing profiles of prospective persons.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method by which an interested person can obtain verified personal data pertaining to a particular prospective bride or groom. The data that is verified corresponds to a predetermined format prescribed by the organization running<br><br>
the matrimonial portal. The interested person, after identifying the profile of a prospective person, can make a request without revealing his or her identity to the portal to verify certain prescribed personal data pertaining to that particular person. If permission is given by the prospective person to verify his or her personal data, then the prospective person has to fill in a prescribed form with the prescribed personal details and submit it to the portal. The information disclosed in the form will be verified either by the portal or an authorized verification agency. The verification report is then sent to the interested person. This entire process takes place without revealing the identity of the interested person to any body.<br>
Thus the invention provides a method of obtaining verified personal data of a prospective person, with the consent of the prospective person by an interested person incognito, through a network having a database containing profiles of prospective persons, comprising the steps of:<br>
i)        accessing the database by the interested person,<br>
ii) searching for the profile of a prospective person having required profile from the database,<br>
iii)      selecting a prospective person with the required profile,<br>
iv) making a request to network system administrating means for verifying the prescribed personal data of the selected prospective person.<br><br>
v)       requesting permission to verify the said prescribed personal data from the<br>
selected prospective person, vi)      getting acceptance from the selected prospective person to verify the<br>
prescribed    personal data of the said selected prospective person and<br>
obtaining the prescribed personal data from the said prospective person for<br>
verification, vii)     verifying the said prescribed personal data of the selected prospective<br>
person, and viii)    providing the verified personal data to the interested person.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the method, to obtain required verified personal data of a prospective person with the consent of the prospective person through a network system having a database containing profiles of prospective persons, by an interested person incognito according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a preferred embodiment of the method shown in figure 1.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the service provided by online matrimonial portals, there is no provision of obtaining required verified personal information of a prospective person by an interested person, persons being members of the matrimonial portal. The objective of the present invention is to provide a method of verifying prescribed personal data of a prospective person, by an interested person incognito, with the consent of the prospective person to verify his or her personal data.<br>
The interested person can browse through the various profiles of prospective persons registered with the matrimonial portal provided in the database, by using a simple query combination provided in the system. Once he or she selects a profile that appeals to him or her, the interested person makes a request incognito to network system administrating means provided in the network system to verify some prescribed personal data relating to the selected prospective person along with a predetermined fee and choose the details pertaining to that particular prospective person which requires verification. This selection is done from a prescribed list, provided by the network system administrating means. For example such a prescribed list may be:<br>
1.	name<br>
2.	age<br><br>
3.	sex<br>
4.	occupation<br>
5.	marital status<br>
6.	annual income<br>
7.	health<br>
8.	blood group<br>
9.	family details<br>
The interested person, chooses the personal details that he or she requires and submits the request to the network system administrating means. The identity of the interested person is not revealed.<br>
On receiving the request from the interested person, the network system administrating means informs the selected prospective person that a request has been made to verify his personal data by an interested person. The identity of the interested person is not revealed to the prospective person. The network system administrating means then requests permission from the selected prospective person to verify the prescribed personal data of the said selected prospective person. If the said selected prospective person agrees to the request, he or she may fill in a prescribed form provided<br><br>
in the system giving his or her personal details prescribed therein as required by the interested person. The data submitted along with this form is then verified. The verification may be carried out by an authorized verification agency. This verification may be done by various known means such as phone calls, exclusive interviews, documentary evidence. The results of this verification procedure is prepared in the form of a report and provided to the interested person, who made the request through the network system administrating means. It may also be given to the said selected prospective person. Only the interested person and the particular prospective person will have access to the verified report. In this way, the interested person can be sure that the information given in the report is true and genuine and he or she can then decide whether to proceed to initiate contact or not, with the said selected prospective person.<br>
On the other hand, if the prospective person denies permission to verify the prescribed personal data required, the network system administrating means then informs the interested person who made the request that his or her request was not accepted by the selected prospective person.<br>
The fee paid by the interested person, at the time of making the request, is then refunded.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION WITH REFERENCE TO THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a flowchart depicting the various steps used in a method of obtaining verified personal data of a prospective person, with the consent of the prospective person by an interested person incognito, through a network system having a database containing profiles of prospective persons.<br>
Figure 2 depicts a preferred scheme according to the said method. Initially the already registered interested person, performs the step of accessing the database maintained by the matrimonial portal. The database contains profiles of different prospective persons registered with the same portal. The interested person then searches through the various profiles, for a profile of a suitable prospective person, according to his or her liking. Once the interested person selects such a profile that seems to satisfy him or her, he or she performs the step of making a request to the network system administrating means verify certain required personal data pertaining to that particular prospective person. The interested person is then required to indicate the personal details of that prospective person that should be verified. This is done by performing the step of choosing the required details from a predetermined list, prescribed by the network system administrating means. The interested person may also be required to make a payment of<br><br>
prescribed fee at the time of submitting the request to the network system administrating means. This entire process takes place without reveahng the identity of the interested person.<br>
Once this request is received by the network system administrating means, the said network system administrating means performs the step of getting permission from the selected prospective person, to verify his or her required personal data. The prospective person is given the option of accepting the request for permission to verify the said required personal data or denying the permission.<br>
If the prospective person agrees to the request made to have his or her personal data verified, then he or she is required to perform the step of filling up a prescribed form containing the prescribed personal details as required by the interested person. This information is submitted back to the network system administrating means. The personal details as given by the prospective person may be verified by an authorized verification agency. The result of the verification process is prepared in the form of a report. This report having the verified prescribed personal details of the prospective person can be accessed only by the interested person and the particular prospective person. In this way, the interested person can obtain true and verified personal data pertaining to the prospective person selected by him or her.<br><br>
On the other hand, if the prospective person denies permission to verify his or her required personal details, then the network system administrating means informs the interested person that his or her request is denied and refund any fee paid at the time of making the request to the interested person.<br><br><br><br><br>
