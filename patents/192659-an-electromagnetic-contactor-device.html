The present invention concerns an electromagnetic contactor device comprising an enclosure formed by a base unit and a housing unit assembled together and accommodating the power poles and a solenoid including a coil the body of which has power supply terminals on one side.<br>
In  some prior  art  contactors  the  power  supply terminals of the coil are disposed on one side only, either the input side or the output side.<br>
The terminals of the coil are usually on the input side of the contactor; in a combination of electrical devices such as a contactor and a thermal overload relay, for example, in which the relay is preferably on the output side of the contactor, the user cannot group the terminals of the coil of the contactor and the terminals of the thermal overload relay together on the same side to facilitate checking them. Consequently, the user has no choice with regard to the disposition of the wiring of the coil.<br>
When a contactor is combined with a circuit-breaker and the respective terminals are coincident in order to interconnect them, the devices form a unit and if the terminals of the coil are on the side facing the circuit-breaker they become inaccessible.<br>
At present the user has no choice with regard to the position of the power supply terminals of the coil at the time of installing the contactor.<br>
A three-pole contactor has on its input and output sides three pole terminals on the exterior of the contactor body and which are regularly spaced across the width of the transverse walls of the body. The two terminals of the coil are positioned so that they are accessible for wiring them, either in the spaces between the terminals or outside the two areas at the ends.<br>
A four-pole contactor has one more terminal than a<br><br>
three-pole contactor on both its input and its output sides, with the result that the terminals are offset relative to the areas of a three-pole contactor. It is therefore impossible to use a coil identical to that of a three-pole contactor since the terminals would not coincide with the available spaces outside the terminals and would therefore be inaccessible for wiring them.<br>
Each type of contactor therefore requires two different coils which is disadvantageous from the economic point of view.<br>
Consequently, an object of the present invention is to provide a contactor switch device having a coil with power supply terminals that can be either on the input side or on the output side of the contactor and with a disposition of the terminals providing easy access to the latter regardless of the type of contactor.<br>
The present invention concerns a contactor in which the enclosure provides between the base unit and the housing unit a housing adapted to receive the power supply terminals, characterised in that the enclosure has symmetrically disposed relative to the first housing a second housing also formed between the base unit and the housing unit and having substantially the same cross-section as the first housing so that it can receive the side of the coil provided with terminals after the coil is turned around, the housing opposite that receiving the terminals being closed-off.<br>
This feature enables the coil to be mounted either way around so that the power supply terminals are either on the input side or on the output side of the contactor.<br>
The coil body advantageously has two additional power supply terminals on the same side as said power supply terminals and each of which is electrically connected to one of the other two terminals.<br>
The spacing of the terminals is determined so that<br><br>
one of the two pairs of terminals is accessible when the contactor has three-pole terminals and the second pair of terminals is accessible when the contactor has four-pole terminals.<br>
The provision of two pairs of terminals and the spacing between them provide access to at least two of them for wiring them, whether the contactor is a three-pole contactor or a four-pole contactor. This feature enables the manufacture of a single type of coil.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an electromagnetic contactor device comprising an enclosure formed by a base unit and a housing unit assembled together and accommodating power poles and a solenoid having a coil the body of which has power supply terminals on one side, said enclosure providing between the base unit and the housing unit a first housing adapted to receive the power supply terminals, characterized in that the enclosure has symmetncally disposed relative to the first housing a second housing also formed between the base unit and the housing unit and having substantially the same cross-section as the first housing for receiving the side of the coil provided with terminals after the coil is turned around, the housing opposite that receiving the terminals being closed off.<br>

The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to embodiments given by way of example and shown in the accompanying drawings, in which;<br>
-	figure 1 is a perspective view of a three-pole contactor of the invention;<br>
-	figure 2 is an exploded perspective view of the base unit of the contactor including the solenoid;<br>
-	figure 3 is a side view of the coil former associated with a terminal cover;<br>
-	figure 4 shows the combination of a three-pole contactor and a circuit-breaker;<br>
-	figure 5 shows the combination of a three-pole contactor, a circuit-breaker and a thermal overload relay;<br>
-	figure 6 is a front view of a three-pole contactor;<br>
-	figure 7 is a front view of a four-pole contactor.<br>
The contactor device 1 shown in figure 1 includes an enclosure 10 formed by a base unit 2, a housing unit 3 assembled to the base unit and a cover 4 mounting on top of the housing unit and defining transverse walls 11 and longitudinal walls 11a.<br>
The housing unit 3 accommodates power poles each adapted to make or break the current on one line of the contactor.  Each pole is of the double contact type and<br><br><br>
incorporates two fixed contacts that cooperate with two mobile contacts on a contact bridge carried by a contact carrier. The fixed contacts are connected to straight terminals 30 projecting out of the contactor body through openings in the transverse walls 11.<br>
The base unit 2 has a back plate 20 for fixing the device to a rail. The base unit accommodates a tripping assembly including an actuator solenoid that can be seen in figure 2. The actuator solenoid comprises an E-shaped core 50 forming the fixed magnetic circuit, a coil 51 around the central branch 50a of the magnetic circuit and connected to a power supply and an E-shaped mobile armature 52 forming the mobile magnetic circuit and mechanically coupled to the contact carrier.<br>
The coil 51 of the solenoid includes a coil former that forms a coil body 53 onto the exterior of which the coil wire is wound. An opening 53a in the centre of the coil body enables the coil to be fitted over the central branch 50a of the E-shaped fixed magnetic circuit. The coil body carries two parallel conductors 54a, 54b each carrying respective electrically interconnected power supply terminals Ai, Al ' and A2, A2 ' at one end. The other ends of the two conductors are connected to respective ends of the coil wire to energies the coil.<br>
The housing 60 for the coil in the base unit 2 is symmetrical.<br>
A first housing 12 and a second housing- 13 with substantially the same cross-section are provided between the base unit and the housing unit, projecting relative to the transverse walls 11 of the contactor enclosure. They are adapted to receive the coil former and in particular the conductors 54a and 54b carrying the terminals. The symmetrical configuration of the two housings 12 and 13 and of the housing 60 enables the coil to be  turned 180°  about  the axis  XX'  so that  the<br><br>
terminals are either on the input side in the housing 12 or on the output side in the housing 13.<br>
Each of the housings 12 and 13 has an opening 14 at the top, a longitudinal wall 15 and transverse walls 16 at the sides. Partition walls 17 are provided in each housing to form individual chambers 18 for the power supply terminals. Openings 19 in the longitudinal wall ( 15 give access to the individual chambers 18 to enable insertion of conductor wires into the terminals.<br>
A terminal cover 61 is fitted over the various terminals and closes the opening 14 and partly closes the openings 19 of the housing 12 or 13 receiving the terminals so that only the screws of the terminals Al, A2, Al' and A2 ' are accessible to the user for insertion of conductor wires.<br>
The terminal cover 61 is attached to a bracket 55 which is removable attached to the coil former by fixtures 56. The sides of the bracket 55 bear against the partition walls 17 of the chambers 18. It has lugs 611 on the bottom the edges of which clip over the conductors 54a, 54b to retain the conductors mechanically.<br>
A removable solid cover 62 closes off the opening 14 and the openings 19 of the housing 12 or 13 opposite that receiving the terminals in order to bar access to the coil. This cover 62 is fitted over the opening 14 when the contactor enclosure is closed. As an alternative, in the same way as for the cover 61, a bracket removably attached to the coil former can be used to carry the cover 62.<br>
Figure 4 shows the combination of the contactor 1 and a three-pole circuit breaker 7. The terminals of the contactor and the circuit-breaker are connected together and "Cooperate so that the two devices form a unit. This device therefore prevents access to the coil terminals if<br><br>
these are on the side facing the circuit-breaker. It is then possible to turn the coil around so that the terminals are on the side opposite the circuit-breaker and are therefore accessible, as the figure shows.<br>
Figure 5 shows the figure 4 combination with a thermal overload relay 8 added to it. The relay is on the output side of the contactor with a connection unit 9 providing the electrical connection between the terminals 30 of the contactor and the pins of the thermal protection relay. The connection unit is not in contact with the contactor and there is therefore sufficient space for access to the coil terminals.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show a chree-pole contactor and a four-pole contactor, respectively. The respective pairs of terminals Al, A2 and Al ' , A2 ' provide electrical connection of the coil with two possible positions of the terminals.<br>
For the three-pole contactor the terminals accessible in the spaces between the three terminals are the terminals Al and A2.<br>
For . the four-pole contactor the terminals accessible in the spaces between the terminals are the terminals Al ' and A2 ' , the other terminals being partly concealed by the terminals.<br><br><br>
