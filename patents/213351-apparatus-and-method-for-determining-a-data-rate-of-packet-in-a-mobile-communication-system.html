DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described herein below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail since they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
The present invention relates to a forward link of a mobile communication system capable of supporting a multimedia service including a voice service and a data service using a Ix bandwidth. A transmitter, channels and a receiver for supporting the voice service are identical in structure to a transmitter, channels and a receiver of the existing Ix system. Here, the "Ix bandwidth" refers to a 1.25MHz frequency bandwidth used in an existing IS-95 synchronous system, and the "Ix system" refers to a system supporting the Ix bandwidth. The data service can be classified into a circuit mode operation and a packet mode operation according to its circuit connection type. The data service includes various video services such as a video conference service, and an Internet service. The data service operating in the circuit mode uses the intact structure of the transmitter, channels, and receiver of the existing Ix system. Thus, reference will be made to the structure of the transmitter, channels and receiver for the packet data service.<br>
Table 1 illustrates the channels required for the forward link packet data service in the mobile communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Referring to Table 1, the channels for the forward link packet data service according to an embodiment of the present invention are classified into a data traffic channel and a data traffic MAC (Medium Access Control) channel. The data traffic channel is comprised of a pilot channel, a preamble subchannel and a data traffic subchannel. The data traffic MAC channel is comprised of a QoS (Quality of Service) matching indication channel, a Walsh space indication subchannel and a reverse activity indication subchannel. The pilot channel is multiplexed with the preamble subchannel and the data traffic subchannel before transmission. A pilot symbol provided over the pilot channel is utilized as an amplitude reference value for sync demodulation and can also be utilized as an auxiliary means of increasing accuracy of CIR measurement for data rate control. The preamble channel is multiplexed with the pilot channel and the data traffic subchannel before transmission, and is used to designate a mobile station (MS) corresponding to the data packet transmitted by a base station (BS). The data traffic subchannel is multiplexed with the pilot channel and the preamble subchannel to actually transmit a payload. The QoS matching indication channel uses a QoS matching technique to guarantee different QoS for respective data services, and is used to transmit QoS matching-related information. The QoS matching indication channel becomes an I-channel component of the data traffic MAC channel. The Walsh space indication subchannel is used to transmit Walsh space information of the base station, which can be allocated to the data traffic subchannel through dynamic Walsh allocation. The Walsh space indication subchannel is multiplexed with the reverse activity indication subchannel to become a Q-channel component of the data traffic MAC channel. The reverse activity indication subchannel is a broadcast channel for controlling a traffic load<br><br>
of a reverse link, and is multiplexed with the Walsh space indication subchannel to become the Q-channel component of the data traffic MAC channel.<br>
In addition to the channels Listed in Table 1, a channel for the forward link packet data service according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a common power control channel (CPCCH) for controlling transmission power of a physical channel for the data service operating in the circuit mode in the reverse link.<br>
FIG. 1A illustrates a structure of a forward link data traffic channel for a packet data service according to an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. IB illustrates a structure of a forward link data traffic MAC channel for a packet data service according to an embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGs. 1A and IB, a minimum transmission unit of a physical channel for the packet data service is a 1,536-chip slot having a 1.25msec duration.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1A, one slot of the data traffic channel (DTCH) is divided into two half slots, each comprised of 768 chips. A leading 128-chip period of each half slot is allocated to the pilot channel (PICH) for inserting a pilot symbol. In each half slot, the remaining 640 chips, except for the part allocated to the PICH, are allocated to the data traffic subchannel (DTSCH) for a payload. hi the case of an idle slot where no payload exists, the DTSCH is gated-off thereby to reduce interference to a service connected in the circuit mode and a signal from an adjacent base station.<br>
Referring to FIG. IB, the data traffic MAC channel (DTMACCH) is comprised of a first channel (in-phase (I) channel) and a second channel (quadrature-phase (Q) channel). The first channel is used as the QoS (Quality of Service) matching indication channel (QMICH), while the second channel is used as the Walsh space indication subchannel (WSISCH) and the reverse activity indication subchannel (RAISCH). In each slot, the WSISCH and the RAISCH have a 1,280-chip period and a 256-chip period, respectively. The WSISCH and the RAISCH are multiplexed to each other, thus becoming the second channel of the DTMACCH.<br>
Meanwhile, the preamble subchannel (PSCH) not shown in FIGs. 1A and IB is multiplexed with the PICH and the DTSCH, and then transmitted over<br><br>
the DTCH. Since the PSCH is used to designate a mobile station corresponding to a data packet transmitted by a base station, it should exist in a leading part of a first slot of the DTCH for transmitting a physical layer packet. A preamble symbol may have a value of '0'.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a structure of a forward link transmitter for a data traffic channel according to an embodiment of the present invention. The forward link data traffic channel transmitter transmits a preamble subchannel (PSCH) signal, a data traffic subchannel (DTSCH) signal and a pilot channel (PICH) signal by time division multiplexing (TDM).<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, an input preamble symbol having a value '0' is mapped to a value '+1' by a signal point mapper 201. The output symbol of the signal point mapper 201 is spread with a specific 64-ary biorthogonal Walsh code (or sequence) corresponding to a unique user MAC ID (Identification, or index) by a Walsh spreader 202. The Walsh spreader 202 outputs a first-channel (I-channel) sequence and a second-channel (Q-channel) sequence. The output sequences of the Walsh spreader 202 are subject to sequence repetition according to a data rate (or transmission rate) in a sequence repeater 203. The sequence repeater 203 can repeat the output sequences of the Walsh spreader 202 as many as a maximum of 16 times according to the data rate. Therefore, the PSCH included in one slot of the DTCH can last (continue) for anywhere in the range from 64 chips up to a maximum of 1,024 chips according to the data rate. The I and Q sequences output from the sequence repeater 203 are provided to a time division multiplexer (TDM) 230 where they are multiplexed with PICH and DTSCH.<br>
A scrambler 211 scrambles a channel-coded bit sequence, and the output sequence of the scrambler 211 is interleaved by a channel interleaver 212. The size of the channel interleaver 212 depends on the size of the physical layer packet. The output sequence of the channel interleaver 212 is mapped to M-ary symbols by an M-ary symbol modulator 213. The M-ary symbol modulator 213 serves as a QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Modulation) modulator, a 8-PSK (8-ary Phase Shift Keying) or a 16-QAM (16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) modulator according to the data rate, and the modulation mode may be changed in a unit of a physical layer packet having a variable data rate. The I and Q sequences of the M-ary symbols output from the M-ary symbol modulator 213 are subject to sequence repetition/symbol puncturing according to the data<br><br><br><br>
