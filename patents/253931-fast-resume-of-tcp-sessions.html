BACKGROUND ART<br>
In the field of data communication for wireless networks, TCP is used as a connection<br>
oriented protocol that fragments and reassembles a byte stream into discrete messages or<br>
packets. Furthermore, IP-protocols are used in the next lower layer for delivering IP-<br>
packets, e.g. by packet routing.<br>
The TCP service is obtained by having both a host (hereinafter also called SERVER) and a<br>
client (hereinafter also called mobile station or MS) create end points called sockets. Each<br>
socket has a number (address) comprising an IP address of the host and a 16-bit number<br>
local to that host, called a port.<br>
To obtain TCP service a connection must be established between a socket on the<br>
SERVER, and a socket on the MS. A socket may be used for multiple connections at the<br>
same time. Every byte on a TCP connection has its own 32-bit sequence number used both<br><br>
for acknowledgements and for a window mechanism, which use a separate 32-bit header<br>
field.<br>
The sending and receiving TCP entities exchange data in the form of segments. A segment<br>
consists of a fixed 20-byte header (plus an optional part) followed by zero or more data<br>
bytes. The TCP software decides how the segments should be. It can accumulate data from<br>
several writes into one segment or split data from one write over multiple segments. Two<br>
limits restrict the segment size. Firstly, each segment, including the TCP header, must fit<br>
in the maximum of 65535 byte IP payload. Secondly, each network has a maximum<br>
transfer unit MTU, and each segment must fit in the MTU.<br>
In the field of wireless communication there is a certain router in the interface between a<br>
land line bound network and the wireless network, The wireless network may comprise<br>
MS:s in the form of mobile telephones for mobile telephone services, or mobile telephones<br>
or computers for data communication. The wireless network may be in the form of the so<br>
called 2G or 2.5G standard for the use of, for example, GSM or EDGE. The wireless<br>
network may also be in the form of the so called 3G standard (the Iu interface) for the use<br>
of, for example, WCDMA.<br>
In the present GPRS standard the router is labelled SGSN, which is a node in a GPRS<br>
infrastructure that is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile<br>
stations within its service area. Its tasks include packet routing and transfer, mobility<br>
management (attach/detach and location management), logical link management, and<br>
authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location<br>
information and user profiles of all GPRS users registered with this SGSN as of June<br>
2001.<br>
The basic protocol used by TCP entities uses a sliding window protocol. When a sender<br>
transmits a segment, it also starts a timer. When the segment arrives at the destination, the<br>
receiving TCP entity sends back a segment (with data if any exists, otherwise without<br>
data) bearing an acknowledgement number equal to the next sequence number it expects<br>
to receive. If the timer goes off before the acknowledgement is received, the sender<br>
retransmits the segment again.<br><br>
The TCP protocol considers all lost packets as congestion in the network. This means that<br>
packets lost due to other reasons, for example momentarily lost connection between the<br>
MS and the router, are treated as congestion. Retransmission of packets is based on long<br>
time-outs if no active TCP acknowledgements (ACK) are received. This means that the<br>
active acknowledgements are necessary to get fast resumes of TCP sessions.<br>
In a TCP based system a duplicate ACK is used to signal that a segment (for example<br>
segment 1) has not been received by the MS and what segment is expected. The duplicate<br>
ACK is generated in the MS when a subsequent segment (for example segment 2) is<br>
received by the MS. Furthermore, three duplicate ACKSs signal that there still is a flow of<br>
information since three duplicate ACKs give the information that three subsequent<br>
segments (segments 2-4) are received by the MS before the lost segment (segment 1).<br>
When three duplicate ACKs have been received, this is a signal that a fast retransmission<br>
shall be made.<br>
In a computer network comprising a wireless radio network the MSs connected to the<br>
network may move between different cells. In a GPRS based system, each cell or a<br>
number of cells are operated by the SGSN.<br>
When a MS moves within the cell or between cells during a call a handover is made<br>
between the MS and the SGSN. For example, the BSC connects traffic channels between<br>
the BTS and the SGSN, employing a pool of voice coders that can be connected to the<br>
switch in the BSC. The BSC also performs the required switching during a call in<br>
progress, as the mobile moves from one cell to another within a BSC service area.<br>
Ordinarily, an SGSN must continuously keep track of (or be able to find out) which<br>
section of its own service area a called mobile is in. It must also be capable of switching to<br>
another SGSN whenever a mobile moves to a cell in another SGSN service area during an<br>
ongoing call.<br><br>
In GPRS the link is temporarily down when the MS is outside radio coverage, or when<br>
handover is in progress, for example when a cell change is done, or when an SGSN<br>
change is done. When the link is temporarily down, a packet (segment) may be lost.<br>
A previously known method to get fast resumes after a radio outage (connection failure<br>
between the MS and the SGSN) comprises the step of storing the latest TCP packet sent<br>
towards the MS (downlink) in the SGSN for the purpose of retransmission when contact<br>
between the MS and the radio link (SGSN) has been re-established. This means that the<br>
MS, upon reception of the resent TCP packet, will send another TCP ACK for the same<br>
packet which in turn means that the TCP sender (SERVER) receives a duplicate ACK.<br>
The TCP protocol handles the duplicate ACK as an indication that a TCP packet is lost<br>
since the same packet is acknowledged if a later packet but not the next frame is received.<br>
This method will be explained further in connection to figure 2.<br>
The drawback with the above described system is that an entire IP frame needs to be<br>
stored for every session. There is no way of knowing if a specific session is going to be<br>
stalled due to link outage. Since a TCP frame can be up to 1500B long, the amount of data<br>
stored per MS then becomes a bottleneck for the SGSN.<br>
Another disadvantage is that one RTT (Round Trip Time) is performed before TCP<br>
session is resumed.<br>
The current implementation in the SGSN is based on queuing of packets. All packets that<br>
are not possible to send are stored until they can be sent. This means that resent packets<br>
are queued at the back end of this queue, wherein the TCP algorithm risks to time out and<br>
to do retransmissions while waiting for the previously queued packets to be sent.<br>
When performing ISRAU (Inter System Routing Area Update), the SGSN is changed. For<br>
this scenario the current standard proposes that queued packets are forwarded to the new<br>
SGSN, but there still remains the problem with TCP timeout to get TCP retransmission.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for an improved communication system comprising a wireless<br>
network and a land line based network, which enables a better method for handling the<br><br>
problem occurring when an MS looses contact with the router, for example the SGSN,<br>
during a short time period, for example during a handover.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The invention intends to remedy the above described problems.<br>
The invention refers to a method and an arrangement according to the appended claims.<br>
The method refers to a router in the form of an anchor point arranged to store the<br>
necessary information about the last TCP ACK that was sent from the MS. When the link<br>
over the air interface is available again and the TCP session shall be restarted, the stored<br>
TCP ACK is recreated and transmitted back to the SERVER by the router. This will<br>
trigger a fast retransmit algorithm in the TCP SERVER and thereby the session is<br>
restarted. According to the present TCP standard, the TCP ACK shall be transmitted three<br>
times back to the SERVER in order to activate the fast retransmit algorithm and thus a fast<br>
recovery of the TCP session. According to the invention, the router thus transmits the<br>
stored TCP ACK three times in order to activate the fast retransmit.<br>
The main benefit of the invention lies in that it requires a minimum of data to be stored per<br>
TCP session. Less than 40B per session is needed compared to the previously known<br>
method where 1500B is stored per session. These 40B can be reduced further by only<br>
storing delta information like done in the TCP/IP header compression, for example VJ-HC<br>
or ROHC. Both the schemes store the same kind of information that is needed for TCP<br>
ACK:s to be able to reconstruct compressed packets from the air interface. The relevant<br>
information in a TCP ACK is source and destination IP addresses, source and destination<br>
TCP port, the negotiated TCP window size and the sequence number as well as the<br>
acknowledged serial number. This is a total of 22B, but may be further reduced, for<br>
example, by reusing the IP address stored for the current PDP-context that normally is the<br>
same as the MS IP address.<br><br>
Data structures for TCP/IP header compression can be reused for also storing TCP ACK<br>
information, which means that the actual memory footprint can be very limited if<br>
combined with TCP/IP header compression.<br>
Another advantage is that an entire round trip time period RTT towards the MS is gained<br>
from the router. The previously known method initiates the retransmission from a TCP<br>
sender towards a MS by the SGSN resending a stored packet to the MS that, upon<br>
receipt of the resent packet, sends a duplicate TCP ACK to the TCP payload sender.<br>
This means that the long delay air interface (compared to the delay towards a fixed<br>
network server) is used twice delaying the actual retransmission from the TCP<br>
transmitter. By storing and sending the duplicate ACK directly from the SGSN towards<br>
the TCP transmitter, the RTT of the radio interface is gained.<br>
Yet another benefit is that by not sending stored TCP packets (that might be dropped or<br>
might be duplicates of each other) over the radio interface, those resources can be used<br>
for other packets giving better radio utilization.<br>
The inventive method is especially advantageous when handling outages in a handover<br>
procedure.<br>
There is a plurality of handover scenarios which below will be explained further in<br>
connection to the appended drawings.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the router is a SGSN or a GGSN in a GPRS based<br>
system. In another embodiment the router is a home agent or a GGSN in a W-LAN<br>
system.<br>

drawings, where;<br><br>

EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows a TCP/IP based network in a GPRS standard according to<br>
prior art. The network comprises a landline based network and a first and a second<br>
wireless radio network. The land line based network comprises a host in the form of a<br>
SERVER and a GGSN and a SGSN. The first radio network comprises a BSC, a BTS and<br>
an MS. The first radio network is based on GSM or EDGE and uses an SGSN in the form<br>
of SGSN-G. The second radio network comprises an RNC, a Node B and a client in the<br>
form of an MS. The second radio network is based on WCDMA and uses an SGSN in the<br>
form of SGSN-W. The interface between the GGSN and the SGSN is called Gn and the<br>
interface between the MS and the BTS in the first radio network is called Um and the<br>
interface between the MS and the Node-B in the second radio network is called Uv. The<br>
interface between the GGSN and the SERVER is called Gi.<br>
The GGSN refers to a gateway GPRS support node acting as an interface between the<br>
GPRS backbone network and the external packet data networks (radio network and the IP<br>
network). It converts the GPRS packets coming from the SGSN into the appropriate<br>
packet data protocol (PDP) format (e.g. IP) and sends them out on the corresponding<br>
packet data network. In the other direction, PDP addresses of incoming data packets are<br>
converted to the GSM address of the destination user. The readdressed packets are sent to<br>
the responsible SGSN. For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the<br>
user and his or her profile in its location register. The GGSN also performs authentication<br>
and charging functions towards external systems, whereas SGSN performs GSM<br>
authentication.<br><br>
The function of the SGSN is as a router in the interface between the wireless network and<br>
the land line based network and has been explained above.<br>
WCDMA technology is used for UTRAN air interface. UMTS WCDMA is a Direct<br>
Sequence CDMA system where user data is multiplied with quasi-random bits derived<br>
from WCDMA Spreading codes. In UMTS, in addition to channelisation, Codes are used<br>
for synchronisation and scrambling. WCDMA has two basic modes of operation:<br>
Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) and Time Division Duplex (TDD).<br>
The functions of the Node-B are:<br>
•	Air interface Transmission / Reception<br>
•	Modulation / Demodulation<br>
•	CDMA Physical Channel coding<br>
•	Micro Diversity<br>
•	Error Handing<br>
•	Closed loop power control<br>
The functions of the RNC are:<br>
•	Radio Resource Control<br>
•	Admission Control<br>
•	Channel Allocation<br>
•	Power Control Settings<br>
•	Handover Control<br>
•	Macro Diversity<br>
•	Ciphering<br>
•	Segmentation / Reassembly<br>
•	Broadcast Signalling<br>
•	Open Loop Power Control<br><br>
EDGE (Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution) is a 3G technology that delivers<br>
broadband-like data speeds to mobile devices. It allows consumers to connect to the<br>
Internet and send and receive data, including digital images, web pages and photographs,<br>
three times faster than possible with an ordinary GSM/GPRS network.<br>
The invention refers essentially to the, so called, general packet radio system (GPRS). The<br>
GPRS of today has an MTU of 1500B (1500 Bytes). The GPRS is implemented as a<br>
virtual link between the MS and the GGSN with 1500 MTU at both ends. Between the<br>
SGSN and the GGSN the link is realised as a tunnel over a GTP protocol that adds 40B-<br>
48B depending on GTP version. GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is the protocol used<br>
between SGSN and GGSN to tunnel various data protocols through the GPRS backbone.<br>
In addition to supporting GTPvO for 2.5G (GPRS), this feature allows the GGSN to be<br>
UMTS R99 compliant with respect to the GTP protocol (called GTPvl per the 3GPP<br>
R99/UMTS standards specification).<br>
Concentration is performed in the air interface between the MS and the BSC or RNC,<br>
because the number of traffic channels is limited. The BSC or RNC connects traffic<br>
channels between the BTS or Node-B and the corresponding SGSN-G or SGSN-W,<br>
employing a pool of voice coders that can be connected to the switch in the BSC or RNC.<br>
The BSC or RNC also performs the required switching during a call in progress, as the<br>
mobile moves from one cell to another within a BSC service area.<br>
Figure 1 shows the MS in four different positions each position being in a different cell<br>
C1-C4, this is indicated in the figure as an index to the MS. For example, MS,cl refers to<br>
the MS being in cell 1. In figure 1 C1 and C2 are governed/managed/controlled by<br>
SGSN1-G via two BCS/BTS, and C3 is managed by SGSN2-G via one BSC/BTS, and C4<br>
is managed by SGSN-W via one RNC/Node-B. When the MS moves between the<br>
different cells C1-C4 different types of handover occurs.<br>
When the MS moves within the cell C1, C2, C3 or C4, there is an intra-cell handover, i.e.<br>
a RAU, due to a new channel being selected in the actual cell due to, for example,<br>
interference or other disturbance on the channel being used by the MS. In the case of<br>
GSM, the resultant re-switching only involves one BSC/BTS and the SGSN1-G.<br><br>
When the MS moves from C1 to C2 there is an intra-SGSN1-G handover, i.e. a RAU: A<br>
new channel is selected in cell C2 managed by another BSC/BTS but by the same SGSN1-<br>
G. In the case of GSM, the resultant re-switching involves two BSCs and one SGSN.<br>
When the MS moves from C2 to C3 there is an inter-SGSN handover, .i.e. an ISC or<br>
ISRAU, between SGSN1-G and SGSN2-G: A new channel is selected in cell C3 managed<br>
by SGSN2-G in the same mobile network. The resultant reswitching involves several<br>
SGSNs.<br>
When the MS moves from C3 to C4 there is an inter-system handover.i.e. an ISC or<br>
ISRAU, between SGSN1-G and SGSN-W: A new channel is selected in C4 which is<br>
managed by another mobile network than the network managing C3. In figure 1, the<br>
mobile network managing C3 is a GSM based system comprising an SGSN-G, a BSC and<br>
a BTS. The mobile network managing C4 is a WCDMA based system comprising a<br>
SGSN-W, an RNC and a Node-B. The two mobile networks have intra communication<br>
enabling the MS to communicate with the SERVER.<br>
The RNC is more capable of performing certain tasks than the BSC. The RNC is more<br>
capable than the BSC since the RNC is capable of LLC encryption, header compression,<br>
payload compression, etc. In a GSM-GPRS system, this is done in the SGSN.<br>
Another inter-system handover .i.e. an ISC or ISRAU, scenario occurs when the MS<br>
moves from C3 to C4, and a new channel is selected in a cell managed by another mobile<br>
network than the network the MS and the SERVER mainly belongs to. The two mobile<br>
networks have intra communication enabling the MS to communicate with the SERVER.<br>
Figure 2 schematically shows a flow chart for retransmission according to prior art. The<br>
same denotations in figure 1 and 2 refer to the same object. A TCP/IP connection has been<br>
established and the SERVER sends a segment SEG1 comprising the necessary headers<br>
and a payload of information. The SEG1 is transmitted to an SGSN1 and stored in a<br>
memory MEM1 in the SGSN1. The SGSN1 refers to the SGSN1-G in figure 1, but may be<br>
another SGSN, for example an SGSN-W. The SGSN1 then forwards the SEG1 at the time<br><br>
of t1, hence the denotation SEG1,t1, to an MS,c2, i.e. an MS in a second cell C2. When<br>
the MS,c2 has received the SEG1.tl, the MS,c2 sends an acknowledgement ACK,SEGl,tl<br>
to the SGSN1. The ACK,SEGl,tl is then forwarded by the SGSN1 to the SERVER.<br>
Below follows two scenarios in case of loss of contact between the MS and the SGSN1.<br>
Scenario 1:<br>
The SGSN1 continuously gets information from a suitable part of the system wheter there<br>
is radio contact between MS,c2 and the BTS/BSC, and thus ultimately a TCP/IP<br>
connection between the SERVER and the MS via the SGSN1 and the GGSN. Such<br>
suitable part may for example be the BSC or the RNC. The information may contain<br>
information on which type of handover that has occurred, for example RAU, ISRAU, ISC,<br>
and may contin a request from a second involvled party that a handover shall be made, or<br>
that an inter cell resume shall be made, etc. In figure 2 this is depicted by a check for<br>
contact CON at CON,t1+, where tl+ is a point in time after tl but before a later point of<br>
time t2. In figure 2, there is no (N as in no) contact at the time of tl+. In scenario 1, the<br>
MS has moved from C2 to C3. The cell C3 is managed by SGSN2 which refers to the<br>
SGSN2-G in figure 1, but may be another SGSN, for example an SGSN-W. In figure 2,<br>
there is contact (Y as in yes) between MS,c3 and SGSN2 at tl+. This information is<br>
transmitted from the SGSN2 to the SGSN1 to trigger an algorithm where the SGSN1<br>
forwards the SEG1 from MEM1 to a memory MEM2 in the SGSN2. The SGSN2<br>
transmits the SEG1 to the MS,c3 at the time of t2, hence the denotation SEGl,t2. When<br>
the MS,c3 has received the SEGl,t2, the MS,c3 sends an acknowledgement ACK,SEGl,t2<br>
to the SGSN2. The ACK,SEGl,t2 is then forwarded by the SGSN2 to the SERVER.<br>
Scenario 2:<br>
The SGSN1 continuously gets the above described information whether if there is radio<br>
contact or not. In figure 2 this is depicted by a check for contact CON at CON,tl+, where<br>
tl+ is a point in time after tl but before a later point of time t2. In figure 2, there is no (N<br>
as in no) contact at the time of tl+. In scenario 2 the MS has not moved to C3 so there is<br>
no contact between the MS and the SGSN2. However, at the point in time t2, the MS,c2<br>
has resumed contact (Y as in yes) with the SGSN1. The SGSN1 then transmits the SEG1<br><br>
from MEM1 at t2, hence the denotation SEGl,t2, to the MS,c2. When the MS,c2 has<br>
received the SEGl,t2, the MS,c2 sends an acknowledgement ACK,SEGl,t2 to the SGSN1.<br>
The ACK,SEGl,t2 is then forwarded by the SGSN1 to the SERVER.<br>
In both the above scenarios, the SERVER has received two identical acknowledgements at<br>
two different points in time t1 and t2. The SERVER has then received a double<br>
acknowledgement which according to the present TCP standard gives information that a<br>
segment is lost.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a flow chart for retransmission according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. The same denotations in figure 1, 2 and 3 refer to the same<br>
object. A TCP/IP connection has been established and the SERVER sends a segment<br>
SEG1 comprising the necessary headers and a payload of information. The SEG1 is<br>
transmitted to an SGSN1 and is then forwarded by the SGSN1 to the MSl,c2. The SGSN1<br>
refers to the SGSN1-G in figure 1, but may be another SGSN, for example an SGSN-W.<br>
The SGSN1 then forwards the SEG1 at the time of tl, hence the denotation SEGl,tl, to an<br>
MS,c2, i.e. an MS in the second cell C2. When the MS,c2 has received the SEGl,tl, the<br>
MS,c2 sends an acknowledgement ACK,SEGl,tl to the SGSN1. The ACK,SEGl,tl is<br>
then forwarded by the SGSN1 to the SERVER. The information in the ACK,SEG1 is also<br>
stored in a memory MEM1 in the SGSN1.<br>
Below follows two scenarios in case of loss of contact between the MS and the SGSN1.<br>
Scenario 1:<br>
The SGSN1 continuously gets information from a suitable part of the system whether<br>
there is radio contact between MS,c2 and the BTS/BSC, and thus ultimately a TCP/IP<br>
connection between the SERVER and the MS via the SGSN1 and the GGSN. Such<br>
suitable part may for example be the BSC or the RNC. The information may contain<br>
information on which type of handover that has occurred, for example RAU, ISRAU, ISC,<br>
and may contin a request from a second involved party that a handover shall be made, or<br>
that an inter cell resume shall be made, etc. In figure 3 this is depicted by a check for<br>
contact CON at CON,tl+, where tl+ is a point in time after tl but before a later point of<br><br>
time t2. In figure 2, there is no (N as in no) contact at the time of tl+. In scenario 1, the<br>
MS has moved from C2 to C3. The cell C3 is managed by SGSN2 which refers to the<br>
SGSN2-G in figure 1, but may be another SGSN, for example an SGSN-W. In figure 2,<br>
there is contact (Y as in yes) between MS,c3 and SGSN2 at tl+. This information is<br>
transmitted from the SGSN2 to the SGSN1 to trigger an algorithm where the SGSN1<br>
forwards the ACK,SEG1 from MEM1 to a memory MEM2 in the SGSN2. The<br>
ACK,SEGl,t2 is then forwarded by the SGSN2 to the SERVER.<br>
However, according to the present TCP standard, the ACK,SEG1 shall be transmitted<br>
three times back to the SERVER in order to activate the fast retransmit algorithm and thus<br>
a fast recovery of the TCP session. According to the invention, the router thus transmits<br>
the ACK,SEG1 three times in order to activate the fast retransmit. In the embodiment<br>
according to figure 3, SGSN1 may transmit the ACK,SEG1 to the SERVER via the<br>
GGSN, based on the information that contact has been established between the SGSN2<br>
and the GGSN, as long as the GTP-tunnel is intact between the SGSN1 and the GGSN.<br>
When the GTP-tunnel has been established between the SGSN2 and the GGSN, the<br>
SGSN2 takes over and transmits the rest of the ACK,SEG1.<br>
Scenario 2:<br>
The SGSN1 gets the above described information whether if there is radio contact or not.<br>
In figure 3 this is depicted by a check for contact CON at CON,t1+, where tl+ is a point<br>
in time after t1 but before a later point of time t2. In figure 2, there is no (N as in no)<br>
contact at the time of t1+. In scenario 2 the MS has not moved to C3 so there is no contact<br>
between the MS and the SGSN2. However, at the point in time t2, the MS,c2 has resumed<br>
contact (Y as in yes) with the SGSN1. The SGSN1 then transmits the ACK,SEG1 from<br>
MEM1 at t2, hence the denotation ACK,SEGl,t2, to the SERVER. Furthermore, not<br>
shown in figure 3, the SGSN1 transmits another two duplicate ACKS, i.e. ACK,SEG1 is<br>
transmitted three times to the SERVER at three different points in time, t2, t3 and t4.<br>
In both the above scenarios, the SERVER has received four identical acknowledgements<br>
at four different points in time The SERVER has then received enough duplicate<br><br>
acknowledgments in order to trigger the fast resume algorithm according to the TCP/IP<br>
standard.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, for cell updates and RAU, the SGSN<br>
retransmits the last TCP ACK, i.e. ACK,SEG1 towards the GGSN to provoke TCP<br>
retransmission from the Gi. All downlink packets, except the last, queued in the SGSN<br>
shall be dropped. During payload initiated paging of a mobile, queued packets shall not be<br>
dropped since these packets are solving another problem and no TCP performance gains<br>
would therefore be achieved by dropping the packets.<br>
In an ISRAU scenario the interface Gn between a plurality of SGSN:s is used for<br>
forwarding new packets from the GGSN, but queued packets should be dropped. One<br>
reason for doing this is that packets that are received after the new SGSN (In figure 3,<br>
SGSN2), via the GGSN, has contacted the old SGSN (In figure 3, SGSN1) can be<br>
considered as new/fresh and can thus increase the TCP performance. Another reason is<br>
that when the new SGSN contacts the GGSN in order to move the GTP tunnel, the old<br>
SGSN can send the latest TCP ACK, i.e. ACK,SEG1, towards the SERVER. This would<br>
make the TCP come into retransmission mode and increase the TCP recovery. The old<br>
SGSN will then forward these packets to the GGSN until the GTP tunnel has moved from<br>
the old SGSN to the new SGSN. After the GTP tunnel has moved, the old SGSN may<br>
forward subsequent segments, received by the old SGSN, to the new SGSN.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above embodiments, but may be varied within the scope<br>
of the claims. For example, the invention is not limited to the use of an SGSN, but may<br>
use any router in the form of a mobility node in the system. Such mobility node may be<br>
the GGSN, or the RNC, or the home agent in a wireless local area network WLAN.<br><br>
