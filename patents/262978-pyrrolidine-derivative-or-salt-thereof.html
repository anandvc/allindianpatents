				<td>Description Pyrrolidine Derivative or Salt Thereof<br>
Technical Field [0001]<br>
This invention relates to medicines, particularly a therapeutic agent for diseases in which calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) is concerned, such as hyperparathyroidism. Backgrod of the Invention [0002]<br>
Extracellular Ca2+ concentration takes a very important role in various living body functions including maintenance of life.   Thus, serum Ca2+  concentration is strictly controlled within a very narrow range by many regulatory mechanisms.<br>
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a polypeptide hormone produced in and secreted from the parathyroid glands and mainly regulates serum Ca2+  concentration.    This PTH increases serum Ca2+ concentration by accelerating bone resorption and accelerating reabsorption of calcium in renal trouble.   Increase of the serum Ca2+  concentration inhibits secretion of PTH, but on the contrary, decrease of the Ca2+  concentration accelerates secretion of PTH, so that it is considered that the serum Ca2+  concentration is controlled, in a sense, by a negative feedback mechanism. [0003]<br>
Included in the hyperparathyroidism in which excessive secretion of PTH continuously occurs are primary hyperparathyroidism considered to be due to adenoma, hyperplasia, cancer which arises in the parathyroid gland itself and secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by chronic kidney disease and the like.<br>
It has been reported that many patients with chronic kidney disease were simultaneously suffering from secondary hyperparathyroidism.    Secondary hyperparathyroidism is one of the causative diseases of renal osteodystrophy including ectopic calcification, and considered to be a cause of the reduction of QOL of patients with chronic kidney disease due to bone fracture, bone pain and the like and of the death of patients with chronic kidney disease caused by a cardiovascular disease considered to be due<br><br>
to calcification in the cardiovascular system.    Thus, the secondary hyperparathyroidism is a big problem in the clinical field, too.<br>
In the secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by chronic kidney disease, excessive secretion of PTH is occured from the reduction of serum Ca2+  concentration caused by the lowering of phosphorus excretion in the kidney and the reduction of active vitamin D.   It is considered that this excessive secretion of PTH is continued and exacerbated due to further reduction of renal function, parathyroid hyperplasia, resistance of the PTH target organ and the like. [0004]<br>
At present, vitamin D replacement therapy is mainly carried out as an internal therapy for the secondary hyperparathyroidism.   However, since vitamin D preparations increase the serum Ca2+concentration, they have an administration limit, so that it is not the state of being able to carry out sufficient treatment.   Based on the above, concern has been directed toward the development of a secondary hyperparathyroidism treating agent which has high efficacy and does not increase serum Ca2+ concentration.<br>
Calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) has been cloned initially as a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which can sense extracellular Ca2+in the bovine parathyroid (Non-patent Reference 1).    CaSR has a function to change intracellular Ca2+  concentration by sensing extracellular Ca2+  concentration, and thereby to regulate production of molecules related to Ca2+  metabolism regulation, typified by PTH.    As a fact to support this, many reports have been published stating that activation mutation or inactivation mutation of human CaSR is a cause of familial hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia.    In addition, reduction of sensitivity of the parathyroid gland for Ca2+has been observed in both primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism. [0005]<br>
It is considered that an agonistic regulatory agent of CaSR reduces PTH without increasing serum Ca2+  concentration, by increasing Ca2+  sensitivity through its direct action upon CaSR of the parathyroid gland.   Recently, it has been reported that an agonistic regulatory agent of CaSR, cinacalcet, has an activity to inhibit PTH secretion by increasing Ca2+sensitivity of CaSR through its direct action upon CaSR of the parathyroid gland (Nonpatent References 2 and 3).    Cinacalcet is expected as a new hyperparath5n-oidism treating<br><br>
agent which may be used jointly with a vitamin D preparation as an already known therapeutic means, a Ca2+-containing phosphate binder which has been used for the purpose of treating hyperphosphatemia and the like. [0006]<br>
However, it has been reported that cinacalcet has a strong activity to inhibit CYP2D6 which is one of the subtypes of cytochrome p450 (CYP).    This CYP2D6 also has an important role in the metabolism of various drugs used in the clinical field.    Since cinacalcet inhibits CYP2D6, there is a danger of causing drug-drug interaction (DDI) by changing pharmacokinetics of a drug through the delay of metabolism of a drug metabolized by CYP2D6 (Non-patent Reference 4).   Based on the above, concern has been directed toward the development of a strong CaSR regulatory agent fi-ee from CYP2D6 inhibitory activity. [0007]<br>
It is considered that mRNA of CaSR is expressed in various tissues including the kidney and parathyroid gland, in addition to the parathyroid gland which is a main PTH secreting tissue and takes various physiological roles-<br>
It is expected that an agent which regulates CaSR antagonistically or agonistically (CaSR regulator) could become a therapeutic agent of various diseases including bone disease and diseases of upper and lower digestive organs (Non-patent References 5 and 6), diabetes mellitus (Non-patent References 7 and 8), hypo-/hyper-function of pituitary (Nonpatent Reference 9) and the like, in addition to the aforementioned hyperparathyroidism. [0008]<br>

Effects of the Invention [0015]<br>
The excellent CaSR agonistic activity of the compoxmd (I) or the invention was confirmed by the following tests. Test 1. Human calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) agonistic activity test<br>
1)	Preparation of human CaSR expression vector<br>
A DNA fragment coding for human CaSR was cloned in the standard method. Illustratively, using 203 to 2387 of NM_000388 as a DNA fragment D4, and 2210 to 3633 as a DNA fragment B2, they were amplified using a human kidney cDNA (mfd. by Invitrogen) as the template and using a DNA polymerase (a registered trade name: Pyrobest, mfd. by Takara Bio), and respectively cloned into a pCR2.1 vector using a pCR2.1 -Topo vector (mfd. by Invitrogen).   Next, DNA fragments prepared by digesting pCR2.1-D4 with Spel andXbal were inserted into the same sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) vector.    Successively, the Augments prepared by digesting pCR2.1-B2 with Sad and^al were inserted into the Sad and^al sites of previously prepared pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-D4(SpeI-XbaI), thereby obtaining a human CaSR expression vector pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+)-hCaSR in which human CaSR open reading frame (ORF) was contained in the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) vector.<br>
2)	Preparation of human CaSR expression cell<br>
The human CaSR expression vector was transferred into HEK 293 cell using a transfection reagent (registered trademark: FuGene 6, mfd. by Roche Diagnostics).    After the gene transfer, this was cultured in DMEM (mfd. by Invitrogen) medium containing 40 |Lig/ml Zeocin (registered trademark) (mfd. by Invitrogen) and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37*^C for 2 weeks in the presence of 5% COi, thereby obtaining Zeocin-resistant clones. An human CaSR stably expressing HEK 293 clone was obtained from these clones by<br>
"54-<br>
selection using the responsiveness to extracellular Ca2+  as the index.<br>
3)	Hiraian CaSR agonistic activity test<br>
The HEK 293 cell stably expressing human CaSR was inoculated into a poly-D-lysine-coated black clear bottom 96 well plate (mfd. by BD Bioscience).    Hanks' balanced<br><br>
salt solution (HBSS) (Ca2+(-), Mg^^ (-), mfd. by Invitrogen) containing 20 mM HEPES (2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-l-pipera2dnyl]ethanesulfonic acid) buffer (pH 7.4), 2.5 mM probenecid (mfd. by Sigma) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin was prepared as a washing buffer.    After the inoculation and subsequent overnight culturing, the mediimi was discarded, the washing buffer supplemented with 1 mM CaCh and 10 ^.M Fluo-3 AM (trade name, mfd by DOJINDO) was added thereto in 100 |xl per well portions, and then the incubation was carried out at 37°C for 1 hoxir in the presence of 5% CO2.    This was washed twice with 200 III of the washing buffer, replaced by 100 )il of the washing buffer supplemented Avith 0.5 mM CaCl2 and allowed to stand still for 10 minutes, and then the responsiveness to each compound to be evaluated was detected using a plate reader for fluorometry image analysis use (registered trademark: FLIPR, mfd. by Molecular Devices).    ]n this connection, the compound to be evaluated was used by optionally diluting with the washing buffer supplemented with 0.5 mM Ca2+.<br>
The human CaSR agonistic activity strength of each compound to be evaluated was calculated by defining the solvent group as 0% and the 2 mM Ca2+  in final concentration group as 100%, and the compound concentration showing 50% activity (EC50) was calculated from a concentration-activity curve by the method of least squares.<br>
As a result, it was revealed that the compoimds of the invention have strong himian CaSR agonistic activity.   Activity strengths of typical compounds of the invention are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
[0017]<br>
Test 2. Measurement of rat plasma calcium concentration and plasma PTH concentration<br>
The compounds of the invention were administered to rats, and their influences upon the plasma calcium concentration and plasma PTH concentration were examined. The test was carried out by single oral administration of the compoimds 5 or 6 normal male rats.<br>
As a vehicle group, an MC solution prepared by adding 0.5% methyl celliilose (MC) solution or ethanol to a final concentration of 5% was administered at a dose of 5 ml/kg. As the comparative control, cinacalcet was dissolved in the MC solution and administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg.   Each of the compounds of the invention was dissolved or suspended the MC solution, or dissolved in ethanol and then diluted with the MC solution as occasion demands, and administered at a dose of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg.<br>
Blood samples were collected from the orbital venous plexus under ether anesthesia before the administration and 2 hours, 4 hours, or 8 hours in some cases, after the administration, and the plasma calcium concentration w£is measured using Calcium E-Test Wako (mfd. by Wako Pure Chemical Industries), and the plasma PTH concentration using<br><br>
Rat Intact PTH ELISA Kit (mfd. by Immutopics) or Rat Bioactive Intact PTH ELISA Kit (mfd. by Immutopics).<br>
As a result, it was able to confirai that the compounds of the invention have the action to reduce plasma calcium and plasma PTH levels by the in vivo test.    Results of typical compoxmds of the invention are shown in Table 2. [0018]<br><br>
[0019]<br>
Test 3. Human CYP2D6 inhibition test<br>
Inhibitory activity evaluation for CYP2D6 was carried out by measuring it in accordance, roughly, with a reference ("Drug Metabolism and Disposition", 2001, vol. 29, p. 1196-1200).<br>
Final concentrations of the reagents in the enzyme reaction solution were respectively ser to CYP2D6 = 7.5 pmol/ml (mfd. by BD Gentest, Cat. No.: 456217), reduced type nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) regeneration system (0.0081 mM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+), 0.41 mM glucose-6-phosphate, 0.41 mM MgCl2, 0.41 mM/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), and a fluorescence substrate AMMC = 1.5 ^iM, 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4).    Each compound was made into a 50% acetonitrile solution and added to the enzyme reaction solution (acetonitrile final concentration 2.5%).    The enzyme reaction was carried out at 37°C for 30 minutes, the reaction was stopped using a stopping liquid (0.1 M tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris-base):acetonitrile = 20:80), and then fluorescence intensity was measured.    The concentration showing 50% inhibition (IC50) was calculated<br><br>
from the thus obtained fluorescence intensity, by defining the enzyme activity at the time of no compound addition as 100%.<br>
As a result, it was revealed that the compounds of the invention have weak human CYP2D6 inhibitory activity.   CYP2D6 inhibitory strengths of typical compoimds of the invention are shown in Table 3. [0020]<br><br>

In addition, pharmacologically acceptable prodrugs are also included in the invention.    The pharmacologically acceptable prodrug is a compoimd of the invention having a group which may be converted into NH2, OH, CO2H or the like by solvolysis or under a physiological condition.   Examples of the group capable of forming a prodrug include those which are described in "Progress in Medicine", Life Science Medica, 1985, vol. 5, p. 2157 - 2161 and "lyakuhin no Kaihatsu (Development of Medicines) (vol. 7) Bunshi Sekkei (Molecular Design)", Hirokawa Shoten, 1990, p. 163 - 198. [0035]<br>
The compoimds of the invention sometimes form acid addition salts or salts with bases depending on the kind of substituent groups.    Such salts are pharmacologically acceptable salts, and their illustrative examples include acid addition salts with inorganic acids (e.g., hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid,<br><br>

In addition, the invention also includes various hydrates and solvates of the compoimds (I) and salts thereof and their polymorphic substances. [0036] (Production methods)<br>
The compounds (I) of the invention and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof may be produced by applying various known synthetic methods making use of their basic nuclei or their characteristics based on tlie kind of substituent groups.    In that case, depending o the kind of functional group, it is sometimes effective in view of production techniques to protect said functional group with an appropriate protecting group or replace it by a group which may be easily converted into said functional group, during the steps of from starting materials to intermediates. Examples of such a functional group include amino group, hydroxyl group, carboxyl group and the like, and as their protecting groups, the protecting groups described for example in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", edited by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, (USA), 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1999, may be exemplified, which may be optionally selected and used in response to the reaction conditions.   By such a method, the desired compound may be obtained by introducing said protecting group to carry out the reaction, and then removing the protecting group or converting it into a desired group as occjision demands.    In addition, prodrugs of the compoxmds (I) of the invention may be p^roduced by introducing a specified group during the steps of from starting materials to intermediates, similar to the aforementioned protecting groups, or by carrying out the reaction using the obtained compoimds (I) of the invention. The reaction may be carried out by employing general esterification, amidation, carbamate formation, dehydration and the like methods conventionally known by those skilled in the art.<br><br><br>
[0038] First step:<br>
This step is a step for obtaining a compound (III) by reducing a compound (II).   As the reducing reaction of this step, a reducing reaction generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.    For example, this may be carried out from under cooling to imder heat reflux in a solvent inert to the reaction, such as aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene, toluene, xylene and the like), ethers (e.g., diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane and the like), halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., dichloiromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform and the like), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA), N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, alcohols (e.g., methanol, ethanol and the like), water and the like, using equimolar to excess amount of a reducing agent such as lithium aliuninum hydride, sodixmi borohydride, lithium borohydride or the like. [0039] Second step:<br>
This step is a step for obtaining a compound (IV) by oxidizing the compoimd (III). As the oxidation reaction of this step, an oxidation reaction generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.    For example, the methods described in "Jikken Kagaku Koza (Experimental Chemistry Course) (4th edition)", vol. 23 (1992) (Maruzen), edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, and the like may be employed.    Preferably, this may be carried<br><br>
out by the Swem oxidation which is a method in which treatments with equimolar to excess amounts of DMSO and oxalyl chloride and subsequent triethylamine are carried out under cooling in a reaction-inert solvent such as the aforementioned ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons and the like. [0040] Third step:<br>
This step is a step for obtaining the compound (I) of the invention by carrying out reductive alkylation of a compound (V) with the compoimd (TV).   As the reductive alkylation reaction of this step, a reductive alkylation reaction generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.   For example, the methods described in "Jikken Kagaku Koza (Experimental Chemistry Course) (4th edition)", vol. 20 (1992) (Maruzen), edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, and the like may be cited.    It is desirable to carry out the reaction imder cooling, room temperature or heat reflux without solvent or in a reaction-inert solvent such as the aforementioned halogenated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, esters (e.g., ethyl acetate and the like), ethers, alcohols, acetic acid and the like, using a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride or a reducing agent-carrying polystyrene resin, such as MP- triacetoxyborohydride (mfd. by Argonaut Technologies, USA), or the like.    Depending on the compoxmd, it is sometimes advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid such as a mineral acid (e.g., sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid or the like) or an organic acid (e.g., formic acid, acetic acid or the Une), or titaniirai(rV) chloride, tetraisopropyl orthotitanate or the like Lewis acid.    In addition, the reductive alkylation can also be carried out at room temperature to heat reflux under ordinary pressure or pressurization in an atmosphere of hydrogen, in a reaction-inert solvent such as the aforementioned aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, DMF, DMA, NMP, acetonitrile, acetic acid and the like, for example using palladium/carbon, Raney nickel, platinimi or the like as the catalyst. Depending on the compound, it is sometimes advantageous in advancing the reaction smoothly to carry out the reaction in the presence of an acid (preferably, hydrochloric acid, acetic acid or the like).   In some cases, it is desirable to use an isocyanate-carrying polystyrene resin, such as PS-isocyanate (mfd. by Argonaut Technologies, USA) or the like, in order to remove excess amine after completion of the reaction.    In addition, depending<br><br>
on the compound, a reduction reaction may be carried out after isolation of the imine as the<br>
reaction intermediate.<br>
[0041]<br>
(Production method 2)<br><br>
[0042] First step:<br>
This step is a method for obtaining a compound (VII) by an amidation reaction of a compound (VI) with the compound (V).   The amidation reaction of this step may be carried out by allowing the carboxylic acid compound (VI) or a reactive derivative thereof to react with the amine compound (V).    Examples of said reactive derivative include an acid halide (acid chloride, acid bromide or the like), an acid anhydride (mixed acid anhydride obtained by the reaction with ethyl chlorocarbonate, benzyl chlorocarbonate, phenyl chlorocarbonate, p-toluenesulfonic acid, isovaleric acid or the like, or a symmetric acid anhydride), an active ester (an ester which may be prepared using phenol which may be substituted with electron attractive group (e.g., nitro group, fluorine atom or the like), l-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HONSu) or the like), a reactive derivative which may be prepared using carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), a lower alkyl ester, an acid azide and the like. These reactive derivatives may be produced by standard methods.<br>
The reaction may be carried out using equimolar of the carboxylic acid compound (VI) or a reactive derivative thereof and the amine compound (V), or one of them in excess amount, imder cooling to heating in an inert solvent such as aromatic hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, DMF, DMA, NMP, ethyl acetate, acetonitrile or the like. Depending on the kind of reactive derivatives, it is sometimes advantageous in advancing the reaction smoothly to carry out the reaction in the presence of a base (preferably, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine or the like).    Pyridine can also serve as the solvent.<br><br>
When a free carboxylic acid is used, it is desirable to use a condensing agent (N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-ethylcarbodiimide (WSC), l,r-carbonylbisimidazole (CDI), N,N'-disuccinimidyl carbonate, Bop reagent (mfd. by Aldrich, USA), 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU), 2-(lH-benzotriazol-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU), diphenylphosphoric acid azide (DPPA), phosphorus oxychloride, phosphorus trichloride, triphenylphosphine/N-bromosuccinimide or the like, or a condensing agent-carrying polystyrene resin such as PS-carbodiimide (mfd. by Argonaut Technologies, USA) or PL-DCC resin (mfd. by Polymer Laboratories, UK),<br>
Depending on the kind of reaction, it is sometimes advantageous for the acceleration of the reaction to further use an additive agent (e.g., HONSu, HOBt or the like).   Also, in some cases, it is desirable to use an isocyanate-carrying polystyrene resin, such as PS-isocyanate (mfd. by Argonaut Technologies, USA) or the like, in order to remove excess amine after completion of the reaction.    In addition, it is desirable in some cases to use a quaternary ammonium salt-carrying polystyrene resin, such as MP-carbonate (mfd. by Argonaut Technologies, USA) or the like, in order to remove excess carboxylic acid, the aforementioned additive agent and the like after completion of the reaction. [0043] Second step:<br>
This step is a step for obtaining the compoimd (I) of the invention by reducing the compoimd (VII).   As the reduction reaction of this step, an reduction reaction generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.    For example, the methods described in "Jikken Kagaku Koza (Experimental Chemistry Course) (4th edition)", vol. 20, p. 282 (1992) (Maruzen), edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, and the like may be employed. It is desirable to carry out the reaction at from cooling to heat reflux in a solvent inert to the reaction, such as the aforementioned ethers, aromatic hydrocarbons or the like, using equimolar to excess amount of a borane-dimethyl sulfoxide complex or lithium aluminum hydride as the reducing agent.<br><br>
(Production method 3)<br>
(In the formula, Lv represents a leaving group, and R*^^ a protecting group, the same shall apply hereinafter.) [0045] First step:<br>
This step is a step for obtaining a compound (VIII) by converting the compound (III) with a leaving group.    The leaving group represented by Lv may be any leaving group which is generally used in the nucleophilic substitution reaction, and halogen (e.g., chloro, bromo or the like); sulfonyloxy (e.g., methanesulfonyloxy, p-toluenesulfonyloxy, trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy or the like); sulfonyl (e.g., lower alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl or the like); and the like may be suitably used.<br>
For example, as the halogenation reaction, a halogenation reaction generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.    For example, the methods described in "Jikken Kagaku Koza (Experimental Chemistry Course) (4th edition)", vol. 19 (1992) (Maruzen), edited by The Chemical Society of Japan, and the like may be employed.    For example, N-bromosuccinimide may be used as the halogenation agent in the presence of 2,2'-azobisisobutyronitrile or benzoyl peroxide.    The reaction may be carried out at from cooling to heat reflux in a reaction-inert solvent such as the aforementioned aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, alcohols, DMF, DMA, NMP, DMSO, acetonitrile, pyridine, water or the like.<br><br>

For example, as the sulfonic acid esterification, the sulfonic acid esterification conditions described in the aforementioned "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" may be employed.   In addition, this may be obtained by carrying out the reaction under standard conditions for forming trifluoromethane sulfonic acid ester (e.g., at a temperature of from cooling to room temperature, preferably about 0°C , with trifluoromethane sulfonic acid anhydride in a halogenation solvent in the presence of a base such as 2,6-lutidine, N,N-(diisopropyl)ethylamine (DIEA) or the like). [0046] Second step:<br>
This step is a step for obtaining a compound (X) by alkylating the compound (III) with an amine compound (DC) protected with R'^    The protecting group represented by R0^ may be any protecting group which is generally used in the nucleophilic substitution reaction, and carbonyl (e.g., trifluoroacetyl or the like); oxycarbonyl (e.g., t-butylcarboxyl, benzylcarboxyl or the like); sulfonyl (e.g., methanesulfonyl, p-toluenesulfonyl, trifluoromethanesulfonyl, p-nitrophenylsulfonyl, 2,4-dinitrosulfonyl or the like) and the like may be suitably used.    The protected amine compound (DC) may be produced by the methods generally used by those skilled in the art for protecting amino group.    For example, this may be produced by the carboxamidation, carbamation or sulfonamidation method described in the aforementioned "Protective Cjroups in Organic Synthesis".    In addition, the compoimd (DC) in which R'^ is trifluoromethanesulfonyl may be produced imder the trifluoromethane sulfonamidation condition generally used by those skilled in the art.   For example, this may be produced at a temperature of from cooling to room temperature, preferably about 0°C , using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid anhydride in a halogenation solvent in the presence of a base such as 2,6-lutidine, N,N-(diisopropyl)ethylamine (DIEA) or the like.<br>
As the alkylation reaction of this step, the alkylation generally used by those skilled in the art may be employed.   For example, this may be carried out at from room temperature to heat reflux without solvent or in a reaction-inert solvent such as the aforementioned aromatic hydrocarbons, esters, ethers, halogenated hydrocarbons, ketones (e.g., acetone, methyl ethyl ketone and the like), DMF, DMA, NMP, DMSO, acetonitrile or the like, or in a solvent such as alcohols or the like.    Depending on the compound, it is<br><br>
