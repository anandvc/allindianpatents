COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"PROCESS   FOR   PREPARING   A   SUBSTITUTED   IMIDAZOPYRIDINE COMPOUND"<br>
ASTRAZENECA   AB,   a   Swedish   company,   of  S-151   85   Sodertalje, SWEDEN,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
The  present invention relates  to  process  for  preparing  a  substituted imidazopyridine compound.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of a substituted imidazopyridine compound, more specifically a new process for the preparation of a 2,3-dimethylimidazo[l,2-a]pyridine substituted in the 6-position by a carboxamido or a carboxyalkyl group. In further aspects, the present invention also relates to new intermediates used in the process.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART .<br>
The present invention relates to a new process suitable for large-scale preparation of a substituted imidazopyridine compound of formula (1),<br><br><br>
NH2<br>
wherein R is a C1-C6 alkoxy or NH2 group, comprising the step of reacting a compound of the formula (2)<br><br><br>
(2)<br>
1 wherein R is a C1-C6 alkoxy or NH2 group, with a 3-halo-2-butanone compound in<br>
cyclohexanone.<br><br>
A similar reaction is described in EP 33094, EP 204 285, EP 228 006, EP 308 917, and WO 99/55706 wherein a substituted amine-pyridine compound of the general formula (X)<br><br>
substituents<br>
^NH2<br>
(X)<br><br><br>
o<br>
is reacted with a compound of formula  Y        CH<br><br>
wherein X is i.a. H, CH3 or an ester group, such as COOCH3 or COOC2H5,<br>
Y is i.a. CH3) CH2CH3, and<br>
Z is a leaving group, such as halogen, mesyl or tosyl, to give a compound of the general structure<br><br>
wherein X and Y are as described above.<br>
The reaction is carried out in an inert solvent, such as acetone, alcohols, benzene, N,N-dimethylformamide, tetrahydrofurane, chloroform, or diethyl ether, preferably at elevated temperature, and optionally in the presence of an inorganic or organic base.<br><br>
The reaction is characterized by long reaction times, e.g. 16 to 84 hours, high reaction temperatures and relatively low yields, e.g. 22% to 55%. The reaction is thereby not suitable for large-scale preparation of substituted imidazopyridine compounds.<br>
We have surprisingly found that if the process of the present invention is carried out as described herein the reaction time can be shortened, the reaction temperature can be lowered and the yield is increased.<br>
OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION<br>
wherein R is a C1-C6 alkoxy or NH2 group, comprising the step of reacting a compound<br><br>
In a first embodiment of the present invention a compound of the formula (2)<br>
The present invention provides a new process for large-scale preparation of substituted imidazopyridine compound of formula (1)<br><br><br><br>
wherein R is a Ci-Cg alkoxy group, is reacted with a 3-halo-2-butanone compound in cyclohexanone to give a compound of the formula (1)<br><br>
(D<br>
wherein R is a Ci-Cg alkoxy group.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention a compound of the formula (2)<br><br>
(2)<br>
wherein R is a NH2 group, is reacted with a 3-halo-2-butanone compound in cyclohexanone to give a compound of the formula (1)<br><br><br><br>
wherein R is NH2 group.<br>
The process of the present invention is perfonned by solving or suspending a compound of formula (2)<br><br>
O<br>
wherein R is a C1-C6 alkoxy or NH2 group, in cyclotexanone and adding a 3-halo-2-<br>
butanone compound, heat the reaction for a few hours and thereafter isolate a compound of formula (1)<br><br>
wherein R is a C1-C6 alkoxy or NH2 group, in high yields.<br><br>
The amount of cyclohexanone is not crucial for carrying out the present invention, and can therefore in practical circumstances be adjusted according to needs and equipment used. It is also possible to mix cyclohexanone with inert solvents, such as ethers. Example of suitable inert solvents comprises, but is not limited, to tetrahydrofuran (THF). The amount of inert solvent can be up to around 50%, by volume, without causing a decrease in yield.<br>
The amount of 3-halo-2-butanone compound is not critical for carrying out the present invention. It is for practical and economical reasons preferred to add 1.1 to 5 molar equivalents, preferably 1.1 to 2 equivalents. Example of suitable 3-halo-2-butanone compounds comprises, but is not limited, 3-bromo-2-butanone and 3-chloro-2-butanone, of which the latter is preferred.<br>
Reaction temperatures and reaction times can be varied to meet the actual need. It is preferred to have a reaction temperature from 80°C to 100°C. This reaction temperature gives a complete reaction within a few hours, e.g. 1 to 4 hours. Conversion is usually above 95% and the isolated yield is usually above 70%.<br>
The starting material to be used in the present invention can be prepared as. disclosed in WO 99/55706 or alternatively as is described below in Scheme 1.<br><br>
Step i<br>
Compound (3) in Scheme 1 is treated with thionyl chloride, or any equivalent reagent, at elevated temperature in an appropriate solvent for a few hours to give the corresponding chloride compound. The reaction is performed using around 1 to 5 equivalents thionyl<br><br>
chloride, preferably 1 to 2.5 equivalents, in toluene at approximately 100°C for 2 to 8 hours. The corresponding chloride compound is thereafter treated with 2 to 25 equivalents ammonia, preferably 3 to 12 equivalents, in the same solvent as above at approximately ambient temperature to give compound (4).<br>
Step ii<br>
Compound (4) in Scheme 1 is hydrogenated in an aqueous alcoholic solution using a catalyst to give compound (5). Example of suitable catalyst comprises, but is not limited, to palladium, ruthenium or mixtures thereof. Pd-Ru/C paste is the preferred catalyst. Examples of alcohols comprises, but is not limited to, methanol, ethanol and propanol, of which methanol is preferred.<br>
The substituted imidazopyridine compound of formula (I),<br><br>
wherein R is a Cj-Cg alkoxy or NH2 group, prepared according to the present invention<br>
can thereafter be used to prepare certain substituted imidazopyridine derivatives that are particularly effective as inhibitors of the gastrointestinal H+, K+-ATPase and thereby as inhibitors of gastric acid secretion.<br>
Compounds of the Formula (1) can be reacted with a compound of the Formula (6)<br><br><br>
(6)<br>
wherein R3 is H, C1-C6 alkyl, hydroxylated C1-C6 alkyl or halogen; R is H, C1-C6 alkyl, hydroxylated C1-C6 alkyl or halogen; R  is H, or halogen; and Y is a leaving group, such as a halide, tosyl or mesyl group, to give a compound of Formula (7).<br><br>
(7)<br>
wherein R1, R3, R4, and R5 are as defined above. It is convenient to conduct this reaction hi an inert solvent, e.g. acetone, acetonitrile, dimethoxyethane, methanol, ethanol or dimethylfonnamide with or without a base. The base is e.g. an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, an alkali metal carbonate, such as potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate; or an organic amine, such as triethylamine.<br>
Compounds of the Formula (7) wherein R5 is C1-C6 alkoxy can thereafter be further reacted with an amino compound of the general Formula (8)<br><br><br>
wherein R6 and R7 are the same or different and chosen from a group consisting of H, C1-C6 alkyl, hydroxylated C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy-substituted C1-C6 alkyl, hydroxylated C1-C6 alkoxy-substituted C1-C6 alkyl, aryl, to give the corresponding amide compound.<br>
R6 and R7 may together with the nitrogen atom to which they are attached, form a saturated or unsaturated ring optionally containing one or more further heteroatoms thereby forming e.g. morpholine, piperazine, pyrrolidine, or piperidine.<br>
The reaction can be carried out by heating the reactants in the neat amino compound or dissolved in an inert solvent under standard conditions.<br>
Alternatively can compounds of the Formula (7)<br><br>
wherein R3, R4, and R5 are as defined above and R]is an NH2 group, be hydrolyzed under standard conditions to the corresponding carboxylic acid compounds of Formula (9)<br><br><br>
(9)<br>
wherein R3, R4, and R5 are as defined above.<br>
Compounds of the Formula (9) can thereafter be reacted with amino compounds of Formula (8)<br><br>
fi	7<br>
wherein R and R are as defined above, in the presence of a coupling reagent to give the<br>
corresponding amide compound. The reaction can be carried out in an inert solvent under standard conditions.<br>

The suspension was heated to about 100°C. Some solvent was distilled off and then THF (35 L) was added and the distillation was continued. The procedure of adding THF and distilling it off was repeated until complete conversion. To the suspension ethanol (140L) was added and the suspension was heated to reflux. To obtain a clear solution additional ethanol (13L) was added. The hot solution was filtered and then cooled. The white solid was filtered off, washed with ethanol and dried to yield the product as a white powder. (8271 g).<br>
2. PREPARATION OF STARTING MATERIALS<br>
Example 2,1<br>
Synthesis of 6-amino-5-nitro-nicotinamide<br>
100 g of 6-hydroxy-5-nitro-nicotinic acid (0.54 mol; HPLC &gt; 98% area) was suspended in<br>
toluene (750 mL). DMF (1 mL, 0.013 mol, 0.024 equiv.) was added and the mixture was<br>
heated to 110 °C (inner temperature). Thionylchloride (99 mL, 2.5 equiv.) was added over<br>
120 min. Heating was continued for 4h at 110°C. The reaction mixture was concentrated to<br>
half the volume (400 mL of solvent were distilled off), and toluene (400 mL) was added.<br><br>
This procedure was repeated once again (410 mL of loluene were distilled off and fresh toluene (410 mL) was added again). The solution was then cooled to 20°C and slowly added to aqueous ammonia (25%, 440 mL, 12 equiv.) over 40 min. Precipitation started immediately. During the addition the temperature was maintained below 15°C. After the addition had been completed the reaction mixture was allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirring was continued for 16h. The solid was filtered off, washed with water (500 mL), ethanol (250 mL), TBME (250 mL) and dried (50-10 mbar, 40°C bath temperature, 16 h) to yield 91.3 g of the title compound (0.501 mol, 87%).<br>
