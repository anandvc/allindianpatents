				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the production of dry aqueous extract of vijaysar heartwood (Petrocarpus marsupium).<br>
The present invention particularly relates to an economic process for the preparation of stable dry powder from aqueous extract of heartwood of Bijasar (Pterocarpus marsupium) by standardised extraction, concentration and spray drying techniques using minimum quantity of water and optimizing heat load and time of extraction of the said process.<br>
Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb. (N.O. Leguminoseae) the Indian Kino tree, indigenously known as Vijaysar, Bija, Bijasar, Pitasal, Piyasal etc. is a large deciduous tree of central and South India and Srilanka, extending northwards as far as the hills of Bihar, Binda and Kumaon Terai. The tree yields the gum kina and its wood contains a dye soluble in water, having a blue flourescence.<br>
It was a popular belief that watery extract of the wood is cure for diabetes. Some medical practitioners maintain that the sugar content of the urine is reduced by drinking water from vessels of vijaysar. Vessels made of vijaysar have a popular reputation for transferring to their contents anti diabetic qualities (Trotter - The common commercial Timber of India and their uses, 156, 1944).<br>
Ojha, K.N et. al. [Ojha, K.N., Pabrai, Paramjit R. and Venkatachalam, K., Indian J. Pharmacology II, 188 (1949)] have reported that aqueous extract of Pterocarpus marsupium Roxb. given orally is effective in lowering blood sugar in rabbits as well as in diabetic patient, without any toxic symptoms.<br>
Seshadri (Seshadri, T.R. Phytochemistry 11, 881 (1972)) has reported Pterocarpus marsupium to be rich source of Polyphenolic<br>
compounds. Various researchers have isolated a number of compounds from extracts of Pterocarpus marsupium. Some of them are as follows: Stilbene, pterostilbene (Mathew, J., Subba Rao, A.V., and Subba Rao, N.V., Current Sci., 46, 337 (1997)); the sesquiterpene alcohols, (3-eudesmol, triterpene alcohol, erythrodiol-3-monoacetate [Adinarayana, D., Syamadunder, K.V., Phytochemistry, 21, 1083 (1982)]; catechin, epicatechin [Chakravarthy, B.K., Gupta, S., Gambir, S.S., and Gode, K.D., Life Sci, 29, 2043 (1981)]; the flavonoids, pseudobaptigenin liquiritigenin, garbanzol, 5-deoxykaempferol, chalcone, isoliquiritigenin, dihydrochalcone.pterosuprin and aromatic aldehyde, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde [Adinarayana, D., Syamasunder, K.V., Seliqmann, O., and Wagner, H, Z. Naturforsch 37C, 145 (1982)]; the isoflavonoid glycol, marsupol (4,4' dihydroxy-L-methylthydro benzoin) [ Subba Rao, A.V., and Mathew, J., Phytochemistry, 21, 1837 (1982)]; pterocarpols A and B [Bhargava, P.N. Proc. Ind. Acad. Sci. 24, 496 (1946)] and other phenolic compounds from extract of heart wood of P. marsupium (Maurya, R., Ray, A.B., J. of Natural Product Vol.-4 179-181 (1984).<br>
The process for production of aqueous extract of vijaysar (Pterocarpus marsupium) known for centuries is still being used commercially.(Caraka Samhita of Agnivesa, 194 A.D.)<br>
This process involves cutting of vijaysar heartwood, slicing the same and crushing it to 25-50 mm length with 5-10 mm width/height. The crushed wooden pieces are put in the open pan type steam extractor and 16 times water is added to these wooden chips. The mixture is heated by steam in the jacket or by direct fire and concentrated, until the volume of the mixture is reduced to % of its original volume. The concentrated mixture is filtered in ordinary filters and the filtrate is further concentrated in electrically heated vessels until, bone dry product is obtained. The total dry, water<br>
soluble extract obtained is around 8% of the crushed mass of the wood. And it takes around 72 hours for a batch of 100 kg of crushed wood to produce 8 kg of the product.<br>
Dry aqueous extract of vijaysar obtained from the above cited method, is only product known in Ayurveda. The time of extraction is very long and yield of the product thus obtained is low. The steam/electricity consumption is also very high.<br>
Further following disadvantages have been observed in the process described in the prior art.<br>
1.	The process involves boiling wood and water in the ratio of 1:16<br>
and then concentrating the same to % of its original volume,<br>
making the process energy intensive with lot of wastage of<br>
steam/vapour in open pan.<br>
2.	Drying/further concentration step in electrically heated vessels<br>
is also energy intensive and the drying is not uniform. The final<br>
texture of the product is also dark brown.<br>
3.	Some  of the bioactive constituents are  likely to  be  lost or<br>
damaged with some loss of bioactiviety as a net result.<br>
Whereas, in the present invention authors have used novel, extraction with refluxing, vacuum concentration, and spray drying method, thereby reducing time of processing to 18 hours and consequent reduction in steam consumption and increasing the yield from 8% to 10.5%.<br>
The novelty of this invention resides in the use carrying out only two extractions of 5 hour each of the crushed heart wood with water, using wood:water ratio of 1:5 only, in each<br>
  extraction.  The extraction system  is fully closed with reflux<br>
condenser.<br>
There has been no improvement in the process described in the<br>
literature ever since.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a faster<br>
and an economic process for the production of dried aqueous<br>
extract of vijaysar heartwood.<br>
The another objective is to concentrate the extract under vacuum, filtering and spray drying the material into a uniform powder.<br>
Yet another objective is to get powder having uniform hue and is stable at ambient temperature. Still another objective is to make the process cost effective and easy to operate, while retaining the original bioactivity.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for the production of dry aqueous extract of pterocarpus marsupium heartwood, consisting of the following steps:<br>
a)	crushing of the pterocarpus marsupium (vijaysar) heart wood<br>
into wood chips,<br>
b)	extracting the wood chips twice successively with water under<br>
refluxing conditions in the minimum ratio of 1:5, for a period of<br>
about 5 hours each in a closed extractor with reflux condenser,<br>
c)	filtering each water extract.,<br>
d)	concentrating the filtrate in wiped film evaporator under<br>
vacuum at temperature ranging from 35°C- 65°C under reduced<br>
pressure ranging from 40-200 mg of Hg,<br>
e)	drying the concentrate by spray drying method to obtain the<br>
aqueous extract in powder form and standardizing the product<br>
by HPLC profile .<br>
The total processing time for 5 kg batch is 11 hours and that for 100kg batch is 18 hours.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the extraction may be carried in closed extractor with reflux condensers having wood to water ratio of 1:5 and time of each extraction as five hours.<br>
In another embodiment the concentration of the filtrate may be carried out in vacuum operated wiped film evaporator.<br>
In yet another embodiment the spray drying may be carried out in a spray dryer at chamber temperature of 160-170°C. The present invention provides an improved and economic process for the production of aqueous extract of vijaysar heartwood, which comprises of crushing the heart wood in chips, followed by two water extractions of wood chips in water in the ratio of 1:5 under re fluxing condition for 5 hours each, concentration of the filtrate from extraction in vacuum operated, wiped film evaporator and spray drying the concentrate to get dry powder of extract.<br>
The process of the preparation of dry powder of aqueous extract of vijaysar heart wood (Pterocarpus marsupium) is described in detail as given below which is provided by way of examples for illustrations only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Experiment-1 ( 5 kg scale )<br>
5 kgs of crushed vijaysar heartwood is mixed with 25 litres of water in an extractor fitted with reflux condenser. The mixture is brought to the boiling temperature and refluxed for 5 hours. After this the water extract is (drained and filtered and sent to wiped film evaporator for concentration under vacuum. In the mean time 25 litres of fresh water are added to the already extracted vijaysar heartwood chips. The contents are once again boiled and refluxed for 5 hours. After draining and filtration the filtrate is taken to wiped film evaporator for vacuum concentration. In vacuum evaporator, concentration of filtrate is carried out at around 35°C and 40 mm of Hg (reduced pressure).<br>
The total volume of filtrate from two water extractions is about 45 litres as 5 litres is hold-up in the crushed wood. This 45 litres contains about 0.5 kg ( i.e.about 1%) of water solubles. The concentration of this lean mixture is increased to about 25-30% i.e. out of 45 litres, approximately 43 litres of water are evaporated. The final 25% concentrate is dried in spray dryer to obtain dry powder of extract of vijaysar heartwood. The yield of the final dry product is 0.50 kgs.<br>

The total volume of filtrate from two water extractions is about 45 litres as 5 litres is hold-up in the crushed wood. This 45 litres contains about 0.5 kg (i.e.about 1%) of water solubles. The concentration of this lean mixture is increased to about 25-i.e. out of 45 litres, about 43 litres of water are evaporated. The final 25% concentrate is dried in spray dryer to obtain dry powder of extract of vijaysar heartwood. The yield of the final dry product is 0.51 kgs.<br>
Time cycle      -       Extraction   -	10 hours<br>

Spray drying	15 minutes<br>
                                         Total                                11 hours<br>
Experiment - 4 (100 kg scale)<br>
100 kg of crushed heartwood of vijaysar is taken in the extractor fitted with reflux condenser. 500 litres of water are thereafter added to it and extractor is bolted. The mixture is boiled and refluxing carried out for 5 hours. After 5 hour of extraction, the mixture is filtered and sent for vacuum concentration in wiped film evaporator. In the meantime 500 litres of water are once again added to the already extracted material and the mixture again boiled under refluxing conditions for 5 more hours.<br>
The extract from the extractor is again filtered and sent for vacuum concentration in wiped film evaporator at 50°C and 100 mm of Hg (reduced pressure).<br>
The total volume of the filtrate from two water extractions is about 900 litres and hold up is 1:1 i.e. about 100 litres. The filtrate contains about 1% solids as water solubles. The concentration of these water solubles is increased to 25% i.e. about 860 litres of the water is evaporated, leaving concentrated mixture of about 40 litres. The remaining concentrate is spray dried to yield dry powder of aqueous extract of vijaysar. The yield of the final dry product is 10.55 kgs. Time cycle -<br>
Extraction	=10 hours<br>
Concentration @ 3 litre/minute       =  5 hours<br>
Spray drying @ 10 lit./Hr.	=   3 hours<br>
Total =   18 hours<br>
Experiment - 5  (100 kg scale)<br>
100 kg of crushed heartwood of vijaysar is taken in the extractor fitted with reflux condenser. Thereafter 600 litres of water are added to it and extractor is bolted. The mixture is boiled and refluxing carried out for 5 hours. After 5 hour of extraction, the mixture is filtered and sent for vacuum concentration in wiped film evaporator. In the meantime 600 litres of water are once again added to the already extracted material and similarly the mixture is again boiled under refluxing conditions for 5 more hours.<br>
The second extract from the extractor is filtered and sent for vacuum concentration in wiped film evaporator at 65°C and 200 mm of Hg (reduced pressure).<br>
The total volume of the filtrate from two water extractions is about 1100 litres and hold up is 1:1 i.e. about 100 litres. The filtrate contains about 1% solids as water solubles. The concentration of<br>
these water solubles is increased to 25% i.e. about   1060 litres of the<br>
water is evaporated, leaving concentrated mixture of about 40 litres.<br>
The remaining concentrate is spray dried to yield    dry powder of<br>
aqueous extract of vijaysar. The yield of the final dry product is 10.50<br>
kgs.<br>
Time cycle -<br>
Extraction	=10 hours<br>
Concentration @ 3 litre/minute       =   6 hours<br>
Spray drying @ 10 lit./Hr.	=   3 hours<br>
Total =   19 hours<br>
The wood to water ratio of 1:5 and Extraction time of 5 hours were obtained after optimizing these two parameters on  both 5 kg and 100 kg. scale with respect to total quantity of dry extract obtained. ADVANTAGES OF OUR PROCESS<br>
1.	The total time of Extraction, concentration under vacuum and<br>
spray drying for 100 kg batch is 18 hours only.<br>
2.	For two Extractions, wood to water ratio of only 1:10 is used.<br>
And there is practically no steam wastage, as all the processes<br>
are carried out under closed conditions.<br>
3.	There is a lot of energy saving in this process.<br>
4.	Concentration under vacuum saves time and energy costs.<br>
5.	Spray drying makes final product uniform with pleasing brown<br>
colour. It also saves time and therefore the cost.<br>
6.	The   Quality   and   bioactivity   of  the   final   dry   product   as<br>
determined by HPLC is at par with     that obtained by the<br>
conventional process. (,TABLE - I to 4,   Figure- I &amp; II.)<br>
