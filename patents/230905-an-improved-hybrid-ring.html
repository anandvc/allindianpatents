				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to an improved hybrid ring.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
3 dB matched hybrid rings function as 'in-phase' and 'out-of-phase' power 'dividers' and 'combiners'. Such known hybrid rings find extensive applications, such as, in balanced mixers and monopulse comparators. At microwave frequencies, they are generally made in planar transmission lines such as microstrip, slotline or coplanar lines which makes them easier for integration with other microwave integrated circuit components. But, when required for operation in the millimeter wave frequency range, the hybrid rings fabricated in such lanar transmission lines tend to be excessively lossy.<br>
An alternative transmission medium, which is well suited for the realization of components at millimeter wave frequencies, as known in the prior art, is the quasi-planar  finline.  The  drawback  of  such  known  hybrid<br><br>
rings of the prior art in quasi-planar finline is their extremely small size, which makes them extremely difficult to fabricate, particularly by the economical industrial process, hence, limiting their applications in the desired frequency region.<br>
Yet another alternative is a variety of passive and active millimeter wave components which have been realized in finline configurations, but the availability of hybrid rings in finline, particularly in bilateral finlirie is very limited.<br>
The hybrid rings in finline configurations matching 3 dB power division, have advantages of low loss and amenability for integration at millimeter wave frequencies, over other known such hybrid rings in other such known configurations.<br>
However, known such hybrid rings in finlines for application at millimeter wave frequencies have the disadvantage of exceptionally small size. The drawback of such known hybrid rings of exceptionally small size is that, their fabrication is extremely difficult owing to their small size, and yet another drawback of such known hybrid rings is their cost of fabrication, which is extremely high.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION;<br>
An object of the present invention is to propose an improved hybrid ring, particularly of an improved hybrid ring for use at millimeter or lower range of millimeter.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose an improved 3 dB matched hybrid ring in finline, particularly of an improved 3 dB matched hybrid ring in bilateral finline.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose an improved 3 dB hybrid ring in finline, particlarly of an improved 3 dB hybrid ring in bilateral finline for operation at higher frequency range, particularly of an improved 3 dB hybrid ring in bilateral finline for operation at millimeter wave frequency range and of the casing for the same.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an improved hybrid ring for Ka-band frequency having small yet convenient size and casing<br><br>
thereof, which in turn are easy to fabricate on industrial scale, and yet giving an optimized performance even at higher frequencies, particularly at lower range of millimeter wave frequencies.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved hybrid ring characterised in that a ring structure, provided with four ports (arms) radial to the outer circumferences of the ring and a casing comprising of an upper block and lower block wherein the ring is metallized on its inner and outer circumference.<br>

The upper and lower blocks, as disclosed herein below, have multiface structures, with a minimum of four faces, one face for each of the four ports and preferably of seven faces to minimize the size. According to the preferred embodiment of this invention three faces, the faces without any port, are of smaller width and another four faces, the faces with one port, are of larger width. The faces with larger width are of approximately twice the width of the faces with smaller width.<br>
Yet according to this invention the upper and the lower blocks have<br>
V<br>
flat outer surfaces and grooved inner surfaces. The outer flat surfaces are<br><br>
identical and inner grooved surfaces, facing each other when the device is assembled, are made to accommodate the proposed hybrid ring. The upper and lower blocks are provided with threaded holes, preferably the upper block is provided with the non-threaded and the lower is essentially provided with the threaded holes for accommodating the assembly screws, and also for connecting waveguide flanges and non-threaded grooves to accommodate the alignment pins.

DESCRIPTION WITH REF. ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION j<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the hybrid ring (1) mainly comprises of ring structure (2), which in-tum comprises of a central hole (3), and outer circumference (4) and inner circumference (5). The outer circumference (4) and inner circumference (5) are metallised. The metallisation extends towards opposite ends 6 and 7 respectively upto certain width 8. Radial to the outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2), there are four arms named as port (9,10,11,12), extending away from the outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2). Each port (9,10,11,12) comprises of outer end (13), the end away from outer circumference (4); and an inner end (14), the end towards the outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2) and two parallel and opposite sides 15 and 16. Each port (9,10,1 1 &amp; 12) is also metallised and metallisation extends from the opposite sides (15 &amp; 16) towards the ends 17 and 18 respectively upto the certain width (19). The metallisation of each port leaves non-metallised part (20) in the centre arid metallised part (21) on the two opposite ends of each port (9,10,11 &amp; 12). The non-metallised part (20) of each port (9,10,11 or 12) continues with the non-metallised part (22) of the ring structure (2). The metallised part (21) of each port continues with metallised part (23) of outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2). Therefore, the metallisation (23) of the outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2) discontinues at the joining point (24) of inner end (14) of each port (9,10,11 and 12) and outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2). However, the metallisation at the inner circumference (5) of the ring structure (2) forms the continuous ring<br><br>
(25). The port (9,10,11 or 12) at its outer end (13) or at cross section A-A' looks as shown in figure 1b. The non-metallised part (20) of the port (9,10,11 or 12) has certain width 26 and thickness 27 and opposite ends 15 and 16. The metallised part (21) is seen only towards opposite ends 15 and 16, and it (21) comprises of certain width 19 and thickness 28.<br>
Figure 1a shows the hybrid ring (1) comprising of ring structure (2) and four ports (9,10,11 &amp; 12) according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, wherein the opposite sides 15 and 16, and inner ends 17 and 18 of metallised part (21) are parallel to each other as shown in figure 1c, which in-tum shows the enlarged view of one of the ports (9,10,11 and 12) of the hybrid ring (1) of figure 1a.<br>
According to the most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the hybrid ring (1) may comprise of ring structure (2) and four ports (9,10,11 and 12), where in the opposite sides 15 and 16 are parallel to each other and the inner ends 17 and 18 of the metallised part (21) are tapered towards inner end (14) of the port (9,10,11 or 12). According to this preferred embodiment the metallised part (21) and non-metallised part (20) of the port (9,10,11 &amp; 12) have opposite tapers (Figure-Id, and figure 1e, which shows the enlarged view of one of the ports (9,10,11 and 12) of the hybrid ring (1) of figure 1d). The metallised part (21) has increasing taper towards inner end (14) and non-metallised part (20) has increasing tapper towards outer end (13) of the port (9,10,11,12).<br><br>
According to the most preferred embodiment of the present invention, the width (8) of the metallised parts 23 and 25 of the ring structure (2) is essentially same, but essentially higher than the width 19 of the two opposite metallised parts 21 of the ports (9,10,11 or 12).<br>
Yet according to the most preferred embodiment of this invention the angles between ports 9 and 10,10 and 11, and 12 and 9 are same and are essentially higher than the angle between the ports 11 and 12. The angles between ports 9 and 10, 10 and 11, and 12 and 9 are essentially equal to 5 λ4 or higher than 5 λ/4 by integral multiples ofλ and the angle between ports 11 and 12 is essentially equal to 3 λ/4 or higher than 3 λ/4 by integral multiples of λ. Therefore, the outer circumference (4) of the ring structure (2) between ports 9 and 10,10 and 11, and 12 and 9 is equal to each other and essentially higher than that of the outer circumference (2) between ports 11 and 12. The mean circumference of the ring structure (2) is equal to 9 λ/2 or higher than 9 λ/2 by integral multiples of λ . The ports as described herein above and below may be referred as input/output ports.<br>
The cross section in the ring region as well as in the tapered section is in the bilateral finline configuration. The tapered finline transitions (figure 1d and 1e) serve to match the port impedances at the location of the slot ring (24) to the standard rectangular wave guide at the input/output ports.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, the hybrid ring pattern is etched from both sides of the fully metallised surfaces of the substrate. The metal is etched from the regions 20, 22 and 24. The hybrid ring (1) is cut<br><br>
by punching or manually accordingly resulting in desired hybrid ring (1) as described herein above.<br>

The means (31) as referred herein are holes, preferably the threaded holes, and there are at least three such means (31). The top end of such means is provided with countersink (32) to hold screw's head and body part with threaded hole (33) to hold screw's thread. The upper block (29) has multiface structure with minimum four faces, and maximum faces upto any number and most preferably seven faces. Three such faces (34, 37 and 39) have same but smaller width, and other four faces (35, 36, 38 and 40) also have same, but larger width. The faces (35, 36, 38 and 40) having same, but larger width are approximately twice the width of the faces (34, 37 and 39) having same but smaller width.<br>
The lower (inner) surface (41) of the upper block (29) is provided with at least two non-threaded means (42) to hold the alignment pins. Two such means (42) are provided on each face, 35, 36, 38 and 40 with higher width. Each such face 35, 36, 38 and 40 with larger width is essentially also provided with essentially one channel (43), having two parallel and opposite faces 44 and 45, and extending towards the centre (46) of the upper block<br><br>
(29). These four channels (43) converge into a ring channel (47) having outer circumference (48) and inner circumference (49), and the centre (46) of this ring channel (47) forms a solid pole (50). The channels (43) are of uniform width (51) and depth (44,45), and form the transition region when assembled, in the manner as described herein below, with the hybrid ring (1) described herein above, and lower block (54) as described here in below. The contours of faces 44 and 45, shown as lines in figures 3a and 3b, align with inner metallised edges 17 and 18 of the metallised part (21) of the ports 9,10, 11 and 12 through out of their length from end 13 to the end 14 (Figure 1a), or only towards the end 13 (Figure-Id).<br>
The face (35, 36, 38 and 40), with larger width, is provided with at least two threaded holes (52) to accommodate the waveguide flange (Figure-2b or Figure-3b), and the face (34,37 &amp; 39) with smaller width (Figure-2c or Figure-3c) is not provided by such means (42 and 52). The upper block (29) has certain thickness (53) [Figure-2b or Figure-3b] and is made of metal such as brass or aluminium, preferably silver coated on the inner surface to improve conductivity.<br>
Figures 4 and 5a respectively, show the top views of upper (outer) surface and lower (inner) surface of the lower block (54) of casing of the proposed hybrid ring (1). The lower block (54) comprises of upper (outer) surface (55) and lower (inner) surface (57). The upper (outer) surface (55) is provided with at least three such means (56) to accommodate the assembly screws. The lower block (54) is also of multiface structure with<br><br>

The lower (inner) surface (57) of lower block (54) is also provided with at least two non-threaded means (58) to accommodate the alignment pins on four faces 35, 36, 38 and 40. In between these two means (58), each of these four faces, 35, 36, 38 and 40 are essentially provided with essentially one channel (59) having two parallel and opposite faces 60 and 61 (Figures-5a and 5b). These channels (59) extend towards the centre (62) of the block (54) and converge into a ring channel (63), having outer circumference (64) and inner circumference (65) and a solid pole (66) at the centre (62). The channels (59) are provided with horizontal flat grooves (67) having faces 68 and 60 on one face, and 69 and 61 on the opposite face of channel (59) [Figure-5b]. The grooves (67) continue on the outer circumference (64) of the ring channel (63) and have two faces, 64 and 70. Similar to these grooves (67), the horizontal and flat groove (71) is provided on the entire circumference (65) of the ring channel (63) and solid pole (66). The groove (71) has two faces 65 and 72 and certain width (73) and depth (74). The channels (59) are of uniform width (75) and uniform depth (60,61) and form the transition region, when assembled with the hybrid ring (1) and upper block (29), as described here in above. The faces 35, 36, 38 and 40 of lower block (54) are also provided with at least two threaded holes (76) to accommodate the waveguide flanges.
