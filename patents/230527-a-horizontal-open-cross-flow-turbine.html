				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates t.o a horizontal open-cross flow turbine useful as a multi purpose power unit, utilising the inherent energy available in water streams in hills in situations   where- sufficient head and water flow he available to develop 3 KW—10 K.W power. Based on the turbine technology1 a new design with low cost fabrication technology has, been<br>
developed to enable develop both mechanical and electrical power from water streams for multi-purpose applications in hills.<br>
The idea of converting potential energy of water into mechanical energy has been known to mankind for centuries. In the earlier days this potential was converted by passing flowing water through wooden wheels known as water mills. These water mills are still in use for grinding purposes. However, these mills are basically single purpose devices i.e. they can only grind wheat, but cannot, for example, dehusk paddy make flattened rice or "Chewra", expel oil or generate electricity. The traditional water mills also have extremely low output and do not provide enough economic surplus to the mill owners. Keeping this in view, a simple but efficient multi-purpose machine of low cost and long life has been developed for use at such water mill sites where hydro potential in the water streams be of the order of 3-10 kW.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a simple machine to produce mechanical and electrical power using the hydro potential available in almost every water stream in hills. The invention is the first of its type, which is capable of producing utp 10 kW of mechanical power for driving agro-proceessing machines directly and for generating electricity if connected with an alternator. Yet another<br>
objective of the present invention is to provide a machine of low cost and long life which is very compact, whose parts and installation parameters are easy to understand by the existing watennill owner and which require very less maintenance in the long run.<br>
In order to have a simple and economically viable machine, a horizontal open cross flow turbine has been developed. The runner of the turbine is successfully cast in iron, which is a unique task, as everywhere else in the world the runners of cross flow turbine are fabricated, not cast. The casting process makes the runner stronger and very economic in comparison to fabrication. It also requires fewer skills at the level of a village workshop, thus making transfer of technology easier. The nozzle with valve is fabricated from MS sheet. In order to reduce the cost of the machine, the turbine is installed without a casing (the conventional cover) as the casing in this type of turbine does not impact upon the efficiency of die turbine. A casing is required only to protect the splashing of water over the turbine and mainly over the bearings, Otherwise bearings will have to be protected from water by providing seals which are expensive. To avoid this additional cost of seals, the layout of the system is designed in such a manner that the runner is over¬hung with the shaft mounted on the bearings. Both bearings are at one side of tii e runner and in-side the wall of the building. The runner along<br>
with the nozzle is installed outside the building so that the water splashes remain outside and not over the bearings and hence bearings are protected from water.<br>
The working of the device is that Water from penstock strikes the runner through nozzle in the from of a jet with the result that die runner rotates, moving in turn the driving pulley fitted at the other end of the shaft. The mechanical power developed by the device can be used to drive a single agro -processing machine directly or more than one machine simultaneously through a counter shaft. Electricity can also be generated if the generator/alternator is connected as one of the end use machine with the system.<br>
The device of the present invention has been depicted in the mechanical drawings accompanying these specifications as below:<br>

The present invention thus comprises of a runner (1) its design based on a conventional cross flow turbine's design but uniquely cast in<br>
iron in single piece. The runner (1) is of 200 mm width and 300 mm in<br><br>
	diameter having 24 blades (10).  Hubs (9) are provided on both side of<br><br>
	the runner for fitting to the shaft with key way (11).   The shaft (2) is<br><br>
                   1 machined from 50 mm stock having the length between the plummer<br><br><br>
blocks (5) at the full diameter. The bearings (6) are 'push fit' on a to a step. The shaft (20) attached with the runner (1) mounted on the base plate (7) through bearing (6) with plummer blocks (5) The nozzle (13) is fitted over the runner (1) and connected to the penstock with flanges (16) through adapter (15). The control valve is integrated into the nozzle and is used to control the flow based on  the power requirement. This assembly is mounted on a base plate (7) and base plate is fixed on a foundation with the help of foundation bolts through holes (12).<br>
UTILITY<br>
The invention is the first of its type, which has the following important and useful characteristics:<br>
(i) This is a multipurpose power unit capable of producing power upto 10.0 kW for driving a number of agro-processing machines directly and for providing electricity, if connected with an alternator.<br>
(ii) The machine is very compact and its parts are easy to carry. It is easy to explain its working to the local people. Also very less maintenance is required.<br>
(iii) The layout of the machine is of the 'overhung' type, which allows the wet components to be kept out side the mill's building, with the bearings inside. Hence cost of the casing and sealing is saved.<br>
(iv) The main component of die machine is the 'runner' where in order to save the cost and increase life, the runner is cast in a 'single piece' which is a unique task, not practiced anywhere anywhere in the world.<br>
(v) The installation of die machine is very easy and can be done very fast.<br>
(vi) The machine is very lighter in comparison to the conventional trubine and can,, therefore, be easily transported to difficult site.<br>
(vii) The visible splashing, that the device produces, makes it a very educative and entertaining sight for local people which the<br>
Conventional devices with their sealed "Black box" lay outs cannot, achieve.<br>
Accordinq to the present invention, a horizontal open cross flow turbine comprises a runner,, casted -from iron having a shaft attached to the runner mounted on the base plate characterized in that bearings, are provided in the base pi ate with plumber blocks through which shaft is attached to the runner, the shaft is provided with nozzle, filled over the runner and connecter to the penstock with flange through adapter.<br>
