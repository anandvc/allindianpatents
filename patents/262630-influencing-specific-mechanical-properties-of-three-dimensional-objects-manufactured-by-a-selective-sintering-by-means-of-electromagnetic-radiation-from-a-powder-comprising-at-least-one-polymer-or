				<td>Influencing specific mechanical properties of three-dimensional objects manufactured<br>
by a selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation from a powder<br>
comprising at least one polymer or copolymer<br>
The present invention .elates to a process for manufacturing a three-dimensional object<br>
from a powder by selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation of the powder,<br>
wherein the powder comprises at least one polymer material and wherein the manufactured<br>
three-dimensional object has an advantageously decreased crystallinity compared to<br>
conventional selective entering by means of electromagnetic radiation. Furthermore, the<br>
present invention relat :s to a three-dimensional object obtained by said process, an<br>
apparatus for said process and a use of a preselected polymer powder in said process.<br>
As known from DE 44 10 046, a process for manufacturing a three-dimensional object by a<br>
selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation may be carried out layer-wise<br>
with a source for electromagnetic radiation. In such a process, three-dimensional objects are<br>
manufactured in a layer-wise manner by applying layers of a powder and bonding them to<br>
each other by a selective solidification of the powders at positions in the layers<br>
corresponding to cross-sections of the objects.<br>
Fig. 1 shows as an example of a laser sintering device by means of which a process for a<br>
layer-wise manufacturing of a three-dimensional object may be performed. As is apparent<br>
from Fig. 1, the device comprises a container 1. This container is open to the top and is<br>
limited at the bottom by a support 4 for supporting an object 3 to be formed. By the upper<br>
edge 2 of the container (or by its sidewalls) a work plane 6 is defined. The object is located<br>
on the top side of the support 4 and is formed from a plurality of layers of a building<br><br>
material in powder form that can be solidified by means of electromagnetic radiation,<br>
wherein the layers are in parallel to the top side of the support 4. The support may be<br>
moved in a vertical direction, i.e. in parallel to the sidewall of the container 1, via a height<br>
adjustment device. Thereby the position of the support 4 relative to the work plane 6 can be<br>
adjusted.<br>
Above the container 1, or rather the work plane 6, an application device 10 is provided for<br>
applying the powder material 11 to be solidified onto the support surface 5 or a previously<br>
solidified layer. Also, an irradiation device in the form of a laser 7, which emits a directed<br>
light beam 8, is arranged above the work plane 6. This light beam 8 is directed as deflected<br>
beam 8' towards the work plane 6 by a deflection device 9 such as a rotating mirror. A<br>
control unit 40 allows to control the support 4, the application device 10 and the deflection<br>
device 9. The items 1 to 6, 10 and 11 are located within a machine frame 100.<br>
When the three-dimensional object 3 is manufactured, the powder material 11 is applied<br>
layer-wise onto the support 4 or a previously solidified layer and is solidified at the<br>
positions of each powder layer that correspond to the object by means of the laser beam 8'.<br>
After each selective solidification of a layer the support is lowered by the thickness of the<br>
powder layer to be subsequently applied.<br>
Many modifications of processes and devices for manufacturing a three-dimensional object<br>
by a selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation compared to the system<br>
described above exist and can be used. For example, instead of using a laser and/or a light<br>
beam, other systems to selectively deliver electromagnetic radiation could be used, such as,<br>
e.g., mask exposure systems or the like.<br>
However, in previous processes for selective sintering by means of electromagnetic<br>
radiation of polymer powders, insufficient attention was paid to mechanical properties of<br>
the manufactured objects.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to provide an improvement of a process for<br>
manufacturing a three-dimensional object by selective sintering by means of<br><br>
electromagnetic radiation of polymer powders, which leads to improved mechanical<br>
properties of the manufactured objects.<br>
According to the present invention, it has been surprisingly found that when observing that<br>
the manufactured three-dimensional objects have a specific range of crystallinity, a marked<br>
improvement of certain, very advantageous mechanical properties including, but not limited<br>
to high stiffness, high compression strength, high impact strength, high maximal tensile-<br>
and bending strength as well as high elongation at break and high heat deflection<br>
temperature are obtained, while on the other hand opposing or trade-off properties such as<br>
good chemical resistance and low post shrinkage by post crystallisation are well balanced.<br>
Furthermore, it has been surprisingly found that particular process conditions, especially<br>
regarding the cooling period after sintering, and particular selection criteria concerning<br>
preselected polymer materials, respectively alone or in combination, contribute to<br>
significant enhancements of the aforementioned mechanical properties and balancing<br>
characteristics. Moreover, a markedly improved combination of both controlled<br>
crystallinity and low porosity in the manufactured three-dimensional object can be<br>
achieved, which provides for a further improvement of the above mentioned properties. The<br>
advantages of the invention are particularly feasible when polyaryletherketone polymer or a<br>
polyaryletherketone copolymer, or when a polyamide polymer or a polyamide copolymer is<br>
appropriately used as a polymer material of the polymer powder. Furthermore, the<br>
advantages of the invention are also feasible for composites, wherein the crystallinity value<br>
relates to the polymer matrix of the composite. Such' composites comprise one or more<br>
filler(s) and/or additive(s) besides a matrix of the respective polymer, copolymer or blend.<br>
As a preferred alternative to classical polymer processing technologies involving pressure<br>
processing of polymers, like e.g. injection molding, the process according to the present<br>
invention can be carried out layer-wise in an additive process, wherein successive layers of<br>
the object to be formed from solidifiable powder material are subsequently solidified by the<br>
electromagnetic radiation at positions corresponding to the cross-section of the object.<br>

Fig. 1	shows a laser sintering device for a layer-wise manufacturing of a three-<br>
dimensional object.<br>
In order to improve a process for manufacturing a three-dimensional object from a powder<br>
by selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation of the powder comprising at<br>
least one polymer or copolymer, extensive test series were carried out by the inventors to<br><br>
find critical factors that are particularly suited to manufacture three-dimensional objects<br>
having improved mechanical properties.<br>
Thereby it was found that certain mechanical properties of the three-dimensional object<br>
manufactured-by selective. sintering of polymer powder materials are -significantly<br>
improved when limiting the crystallinity of the manufactured object, and in particular when<br>
adjusting the obtained crystallinity within a specific range. Surprisingly, this resulted in a<br>
marked improvement of certain, very advantageous mechanical properties including, but<br>
not limited to high stiffness, high compression strength, high impact strength, high maximal<br>
tensile- and bending strength as well as high elongation at break and high heat deflection<br>
temperature, while on the other hand trade-off properties such as good chemical resistance<br>
and low post shrinkage by post crystallisation are well balanced. Furthermore, a decrease of<br>
the porosity of the manufactured object became feasible, which additionally contributes to<br>
the improvement of the mechanical properties of the manufactured object.<br>
Objects manufactured by selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation of a<br>
powder comprising at least one polymer, typically have crystallinity values substantially<br>
higher than objects manufactured by classical polymer processing technologies like e.g.<br>
injection molding. That is, in a process for manufacturing a three-dimensional object from a<br>
powder by selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation of the powder<br>
comprising at least one polymer, for example of a type as it is illustrated in Fig. 1,<br>
crystallinity values in the manufactured object tend to become predominant without the<br>
crystallinity adjustment according to the present invention. Specifically, in the layer-wise<br>
building process, a high powder bed temperature lying at about 1-50°C, preferably 1-30°C,<br>
even more preferably 1-20°C and most preferably 1-10°C below the melting point Tm of the<br>
polymer is generally used. The object is typically exposed to relatively high processing<br>
temperatures for a substantial period of time and still passes a usually very long cooling<br>
period. To prevent or minimize curling of the part during the building process, the<br>
processing temperature should be kept close to the melting point of the polymer powder in<br>
order to provide for a good connection between succesive layers and minimizes the<br>
formation of pores due to an inadequately melting of the powder particles. Consequently,<br>
the temperature of the powder bed is kept during the whole building process above the<br>
crystallization temperature Tc of the polymer. The generated object itself may be exposed<br><br>
for a long time to temperatures above Tc. At the end of the building process, when all<br>
heating sources of the sintering machine are switched off, the cooling through Tc of the<br>
object starts due to natural heat loss to the environment. Because of the low heat<br>
conductivity of the polymer powder and the large powder bed, this may take hours to days,<br>
depending on the polymer powder used and the processing conditions, i.e. without<br>
predefining a proper cooling rate - which would further amplify crystallization of the<br>
polymer object, eventually during the cooling process. Without proper control, even post-<br>
crystallization of the laser sintered polymer object may occur. As a consequence, relatively<br>
high and partly extremely high crystallinities are obtained in the manufactured object<br>
without properly observing crystallinity characteristics according to the present invention.<br>
In turn, without properly limiting crystallinity, relevant mechanical properties of the object<br>
may be worsened.<br>
On the other hand, in the selective sintering process according to the present invention, the<br>
crystallinity in the manufactured object may be beneficially adjusted still high enough to<br>
also provide for positive influences on high chemical resistance, low post shrinkage at<br>
temperatures above Tg or high stiffness of the manufactured object. Thus, an excellent<br>
balance of properties can be achieved by the present invention.<br>
When the crystallinity of the object manufactured from polymer powder materials is<br>
properly limited and preferably adjusted within a particular range, a marked improvement<br>
of certain, very advantageous mechanical properties like tensile strength, Young's modulus<br>
and elongation at break can be attained. 1) Preselecting an appropriate type of polymer<br>
material, 2) tailoring of the structural characteristics and/or modifications of the polymer<br>
comprised in the preselected powder, and/or 3) paying attention to a predefined and/or<br>
controlled cooling step after completion of the sintering process of the object are<br>
particularly effective and preferred means to limit and adjust the crystallinity values of the<br>
manufactured object.<br>
Thus, according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, a predefined and/or<br>
controlled cooling step after completion of the object after the sintering is preferably<br>
applied to the object. The predefined and/or controlled cooling step may be realized by<br>
predefined slow cooling, possibly slower than native (passive) cooling, or by active cooling<br><br>
in order to provide fast cooling. As the conditions of the predefined and/or controlled<br>
cooling step mainly depend on the type and specification of the polymer, copolymer or<br>
polymer blend used, useful settings for said cooling step can be experimentally tested with<br>
the proviso that the final crystallinity is preferably 80% or less, preferably 50% or less,<br>
especially 5-70%, more preferably 15-50.% and particularly. 15-35%.<br>
As for example, illustrated when using PAEK materials as representative examples and<br>
seeking to prevent curling, PEEK (polyetheretherketone) rather need a well defined low<br>
cooling rate after the sintering/building process of the object, while other PAEK materials<br>
like PEK (polyetherketone) are preferably cooled down with a fast cooling rate after the<br>
sintering/building process. Preferred cooling rates for PAEKs after the sintering/building<br>
process are: When the manufactured object is cooled from the processing temperature<br>
which is preferably at a temperature being 1-10°C lower than the melting point of the<br>
powder, to Tg of the used PAEK, the cooling rate is preferably 0.01-10°C/min and more<br>
preferably between 0.1-5°C/min and most preferably between l-5°C/min, in order to<br>
minimize and ensure low post-crystallization and low curling of the parts. For example,<br>
preselecting PEK powder and appropriately applying a cooling rate of e.g. 0.3°C/min, a low<br>
crystallinity of e.g. 36% is attained, which provides improved mechanical properties like a<br>
tensile strength of 79 MPa (see Example 5). Further limiting crystallinity down to 31%, for<br>
example by applying a faster cooling rate of e.g. more than 0.3°C/min provides a<br>
surprisingly further improved tensile strength of 88 MPa (Example 6).<br>
However, the cooling rate after completion of the object may also affect the curling and<br>
thus the dimensional stability of the object. It has been surprisingly found that the cooling<br>
rate can be predefined such that the three-dimensional object has not only a specific range<br>
of crystallinity and thereby provides the above mentioned advantageous mechanical<br>
properties, but also a high dimensional stability, that is, it does not curl.<br>
As for example illustratively demonstrated by using PAEK polymers, it was found that a<br>
PEEK powder, rather needs a relatively slow cooling rate, e.g. about 0.1-0.3°C/min,<br>
compared to a PEK powder in order to attain both low crystallinity and high dimensional<br>
stability (avoiding curling) (cf. Examples 2 and 3). At a higher cooling rate, this material<br>
would tend to curling phenomena .<br><br>
In the following, some significant structural characteristics or modifications of a polymer or<br>
copolymer material, which are appropriate for a preselection to be subjected to a selective<br>
sintering process by electromagnetic radiation, are exemplarily described for PAEK<br>
polymers and copolymers. It will become apparent for the person skilled in the art that the<br>
below described structural characteristics or modifications likewise apply to other kinds of<br>
polymers.<br>
Particularly suitable alternative polymer materials other than PEAK polymers and<br>
copolymers include, but are not limited to polyamides, polyesters, polyethers, polyolefines,<br>
polystyrenes, polyphenylensulfides, polyvinylidenfluorides, polyphenylenoxides,<br>
polyimides, and copolymers thereof. Suitable polyamide polymers or copolymers may be<br>
selected from the group consisting of polyamide 6, polyamide 66, polyamide 11, polyamide<br>
12, polyamide 612, polyamide 610, polyamide1010, polyamidel212 and copolymers<br>
comprising at least one of the aforementioned polymers, and polyamide elastomers such as<br>
polyether block amide, e.g. PEBAX®-based materials. Suitable polyester polymers or<br>
copolymers may be selelected from the group consisting of polyalkylentherephthalates (e.g.<br>
PET, PBT) and their copolymers with 1,4-cyclohexanedimethylol. Suitable polyolefine<br>
polymers or copolymers may be selected from the group consisting of polyethylene and<br>
polypropylen. Suitable polystyrene polymers or copolymers may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of syndiotactic- and isotactic polystyrene.<br>
Assuming a given molecular weight of a selected polymer such as PAEK as a reference, it<br>
was found by the inventors that already a relatively slight increase in molecular weight of<br>
the polymer comprised in the powder readily leads to a surprisingly marked decrease of the<br>
crystallinity in the manufactured object, which in turn transforms into a significant<br>
improvement of certain, very advantageous mechanical properties of the manufactured<br>
object. For example, preselecting a PEEK polymer material having a relatively higher<br>
molecular weight of typically Mn=32,000 and Mw=99,000 rather than having a molecular<br>
weight of typically Mn=23,000 and Mw=68,000 assists in lowering crystallinity of the<br>
manufactured object to below 50% (see, e.g. Examples 1 and 2 showing a lowering from<br>
52% to 45%). While an increase in molecular weight might lower the density and thus<br>
increase porosity, it substantially contributes to increasing the tensile strength and<br><br>
elongation at break (see, e.g. Examples 1 and 2 showing a considerable increase in tensile<br>
strength from 44 MPa to 71 MPa and an increase in elongation at break from -1% to -2%).<br>
However, above a specific molecular weight, a saturation effect occurs. No considerable<br>
decrease of crystallinity and increase of mechanical properties is possible anymore (cf.<br>
Example 3). Therefore, the molecular-weight Mn is preferably adjusted to at least 9,000,<br>
preferably 10,000 to 100,000, more preferably 15,000 to 50,000 and most preferably 20,000<br>
to 35,000 or Mw is preferably adjusted to 20,000 to 500,000, preferably 40,000 to 200,000<br>
and more preferably 50,000 to 125,000.<br>
Analogous explanations as stated above for the molecular weight also apply for the melt<br>
viscosity of the polymer or copolymer. The melt viscosity correlates with the molecular<br>
weight of the polymer or copolymer as follows: the higher the molecular weight of a<br>
polymer or copolymer, the higher is also its melt viscosity. Therefore, for PAEK polymers<br>
or copolymers, melt viscosities in a range of 0.05 - 1.0 kN*s/m , more preferably 0.15 -<br>
0.6 kN*s/m2 and particularly 0.2-0.45 kN*s/m2 are preferred.<br>
The formula shown below shows a general structure for PAEK or PAES polymers and<br>
copolymers that are preferred to built up laser sintered objects, wherein structural<br>
peculiarities will be further described below to obtain desirably low crystallinities:<br><br>
Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3 independently from each other denote unsubstituted or substituted,<br>
monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, wherein optional substituents may be<br>
selected from:<br>
Rf1, Rf2, Rf3 = denote independently from each other C1 to C6 straight chain or branched<br>
chain or cyclic alkyl and alkoxy groups, and aryl groups, preferably Me, i-Pr, t-Bu, Ph,<br>
wherein each Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3 may have one or more Rf1, Rf2, Rf3 substituent(s)<br>
respectively<br><br>
X = 0 and/or S<br>
Y = CO and/or SO2<br>
Z = SO2, CO, O and/or S<br>
a is a low integer which is more than 0, preferably lower than 12, more preferably 1 to 6<br>
and particularly 1 to 3<br>
b is a low integer which is more than 0, preferably lower than 12, more preferably 1 to 6<br>
and particularly 1 to 3<br>
c is 0 or a low integer, preferably lower than 12, more preferably 1 to 6 and particularly 1<br>
to 3<br>
n denotes the degree of polymerisation<br>
In the above general formula, the indices a, b and c denote the number of the respective<br>
units in squared brackets in the repeating unit of the polymer or the repeating units of the<br>
copolymer respectively, wherein one or more unit(s) of the same kind, e.g. the unit indexed<br>
with a, may be located between units of a different kind, e.g. the unit indexed with b and/or<br>
c. The location of the respective units within the repeating unit may be derived from the<br>
abbreviation of the PAEK derivative.<br>
For example, for PEK, the repeating unit comprises Ar1 being unsubstituted phenylene, X<br>
being O and a = 1, Ar2 being unsubstituted phenylene, Y being CO and b =1 and c = 0.<br>
Thus, PEK has a structure of the following formula<br><br>
, wherein n denotes the degree of polymerisation. As another example, for PEEK, the<br>
repeating unit comprises An being unsubstituted phenylene, X being 0 and a = 2, Ar2<br>
being unsubstituted phenylene, Y being CO and b =1 and c = 0. Concerning the location of<br>
the respective ester and ketone units, the abbreviation PEEK indicates that two ester (E)<br>
units are followed by one ketone (K) unit, thus PEEK has a structure of the following<br>
formula<br><br><br>
, wherein n denotes the degree of polymerisation. As a further example, for PEKEKK, the<br>
repeating unit comprises Ar1 being unsubstituted phenylene, X being O and a = 2, Ar1<br>
being unsubstituted phenylene, Y being CO and b =3 and c = 0. Concerning the location of<br>
the respective ester and ketone units, the abbreviation PEKEKK indicates that one ester (E)<br>
unit is followed by one ketone (K) unit, then one ether unit follows which is followed by 2<br>
ketone units, thus PEKEKK has a structure of the following formula<br><br>
, wherein n denotes the degree of polymerisation.<br>
For PAEK polymers and copolymers, the degree of polymerisation n is preferably 10 to<br>
1.000, more preferably 20 to 500 and particularly 40 to 250.<br>
The larger the required space of the aromatic hydrocarbon group Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3, the more<br>
the aromatic hydrocarbon group behaves like a rigid rod segment and the lower is the final<br>
crystallinity of the manufactured object. Hence, it is preferred that the aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon groups Ar1, Ar2 and Ar3 are respectively and independently selected from the<br>
group consisting of 1,4-phenylene, 4,4'-biphenylene, 4,4'-isopropylidendiphenylene, 4,4'-<br>
diphenylsulfone, 1,4-, 1,5- and 2,6-naphthalene, 4,4'-terphenylene and alpha-di(4-<br>
phenylene)phtalide.<br>
Side chains Rf1, Rf2, Rf3 at the aromatic hydrocarbons in the backbone chain affect the<br>
mobility of the polymer chains in the melt and thus preferably allow to beneficially<br>
influence, hence lower the final crystallinity of the manufactured object.<br>
Moreover, the ratio between the amount of keto groups Y and the amount of ether- or<br>
thioether groups X is preferably 1:4 to 4:1. Within this ratio range, the crystallinity can be<br><br>
considerably lowered. For example, when comparing the use of PEK (ratio 1:1) and PEEK<br>
(ratio 2:1) having similar typical molecular weights (cf. examples 1 and 4). PEK is<br>
preferred over PEEK in terms of achieving lower crystallinity. On the other hand, a<br>
similarly controlled crystallinity can be achieved also when using PEEK by making use of<br>
other compensation control; e.g. by using PEEK of correspondingly higher molecular<br>
weight, or by appropriately predefining cooling after sintering at a high cooling rate.<br>
A further possibility for tailoring the polymer to achieve the desirably limited final<br>
crystallinity of the manufactured object after the selective sintering process is to use an<br>
appropriate copolymer. For PAEKs, a copolymer with polyarylethersulfone (PAES) is<br>
preferable, in particular a polyaryletherketone(PAEK)/polyarylethersulfone(PAES)-<br>
diblock-copolymer or PAEK/PAES/PAEK-triblock-copolymer, more particular a<br>
polyetherketone(PEK)/poIyethersulfone(PES)-diblock-copolymer or PEK/PES/PEK-<br>
triblock-copolymer. It was found that the higher the amount of the polyarylethersulfone-<br>
component, the lower the crystallinity of the manufactured object. Thus, in particular, the<br>
ratio of the amount of sulfone groups Z to the amount of keto groups Y is preferably<br>
between 50:50 and 10:90. Within this ratio range, a glass transition temperature (Tg) and a<br>
melting point (Tm) of the polymer material can be adjusted which are suitable for<br>
processing the polymer in an apparatus for manufacturing a three-dimensional object by a<br>
selective sintering by means of electromagnetic radiation. In order to provide suitable<br>
processing temperatures for the selective sintering process, said PEK/PES-copolymers<br>
preferably have a Tg higher than 180°C and a melting temperature Tm of 300 to 430°C.<br>
It was further found that the end groups of the backbone chain of the polymer or copolymer<br>
may act as a crystallisation seed during the crystallisation. Therefore, the end groups of the<br>
polymer or copolymer may be derivatised in order to interfere with crystallisation, and thus<br>
to limit the crystallinity of the manufactured object.<br>
The end groups may also be chosen such that they lead to an elongation of the poiymei- or<br>
copolymer chain by a chemical reaction, preferably at temperatures above Tm of the<br>
polymer, between the end group, e.g. by polycondensation, elektrophilic or nucleophilic<br>
aromatic substitution, coupling reactions or the like. This results in a decrease of the<br>
crystallinity of the manufactured object due to an increased molecular mass<br><br>
The end groups of the backbone chain of the polymer or copolymer depend on the kinds of<br>
monomers used for synthesis and on the kind of polymerisation. In the following, two<br>
different kinds of PAEK synthesis schemes resulting in different kinds of PAEKs with<br>
different end groups are shown.<br>
PAEKs can be normally synthesized in two ways, namely by electrophilic aromatic<br>
substitution (Friedel-Crafts-Acylation) or nucleophilic aromatic substitution. For example,<br>
in the nucleophilic synthesis of a PAEK, a 1,4-bishydroxy-benzene is polymerized with an<br>
4,4' dihalogenated benzophenone component:<br>
xHO-Ph-OH + (y+1) Hal-Ph-CO-Ph-Hal → Hal-Ph-CO-Ph-[0-Ph-O]x[Ph-CO-Ph]y-Hal<br>
, wherein Hal is F, Cl, Br and x and y denote the number of monomers incorporated in the<br>
polymer.<br>
As a result , the PAEK backbone chain, in the above example PEEK may be terminated<br>
with a residual halogen group after the polymerization, most suitably with fluorine,<br>
optionally alternatively with chlorine or bromine, at none or one end (not shown) or at both<br>
ends (shown) of the backbone chain. The same applies for the synthesis of PAEK or<br>
polyethersulfone (PAES) copolymers, wherein the dihalogenated ketone unit may be<br>
substituted partly by a dihalogenated aromatic sulfone. The aromatic bishydroxy-<br>
component may likewise be partly or fully substituted by a bisthiol component.<br>
For example, the halogen substituted ends of the polymer may be derivatized by a<br>
termination reaction with phenol:<br>
2Ph-OH + Hal-Ph-CO-Ph-[O-Ph-O]x[Ph-CO-Ph]y-Hal →<br>
Ph-O-Ph-CO-Ph-[O-Ph-O]x[Ph-CO-Ph]y-O-Ph<br>
Preferably, Hal in the formulae above is F.<br>
In the case of synthesis of PAEK polymers or copolymers by electrophilic aromatic<br>
substitution reaction, diacylaromates, e.g. aromatic diacids or preferably aromatic diacid<br>
chlorides or aromatic diacid anhydrides, are polymerized with a bisaromatic ether or<br><br>
thioether component. For example, for PEKK, this may result in PEKK polymers or<br>
copolymers with phenyl groups at none or one end (not shown) or both ends (shown) of the<br>
backbone chain:<br>
x RAOC-Ph-CORA + (y+1) PhrO-Ph → Ph-O-Ph-[OC-Ph-CO]x[Ph-O-Ph]y-H -<br>
, wherein RA is Cl or -OH and x and y denote the number of monomers incorporated in the<br>
polymer.<br>
Alternatively, a synthesis by a single monomer route using, for example, an aromatic<br>
mono-acid chloride may be applied.<br>
For example, the phenyl groups at the ends of the polymer may be derivatized by a<br>
termination reaction with benzoic acid chloride:<br>
2Ph-COCl + Ph-O-Ph-[OC-Ph-CO]x[Ph-O-Ph]y-H →<br>
Ph-CO-Ph-O-Ph-[OC-Ph-CO]x[Ph-O-Ph]y-OC-Ph<br>
Irrespective if a nucleophilic or aromatic substitution reaction is chosen, to slow down<br>
crystallization of the polymer, the end groups may be preferably substituted, e.g. such that a<br>
PAEK polymer has the following formula:<br>
RT-U-[PAEK]- U-RT<br>
, wherein U is a linking moiety, for example NH, O, CO, CO-O-, SO, a single bond, -<br>
(CH2)k wherein k is 1-6, or the like; and the left hand and right hand structural moieties RT<br>
may be the same or different structural groups, usually the structural moieties RT are the<br>
same. Preferably, RT is selected from the group of unsubstituted or substituted aliphatic or<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon residues. U may be formed by direct reaction with the ends of the<br>
polymer or copolymer, for example a monofunctional hydroxy compound may form 0 as<br>
U, or it may be introduced as a substituent of the termination reagent, e.g. HO-Ph-COO-<br>
tert-butyl may form COO as U.<br><br>
Furthermore, if it is necessary to increase the crystallization rate in order to adjust the<br>
crystallinity of the manufactured three-dimensional object appropriately, the<br>
polyaryletherketones with a halogenated end group can be terminated with ionic end groups<br>
like e.g. phenate salts like NaOPhSO3Na or NaOPhCOPhOPhS03Na. Subsequent<br>
acidification of the phenate salts with e.g. HC1 leads to -SO3H end groups that show a<br>
slightly reduced nucleation effect.<br>
The polymer or copolymer may be blended with an alloying component in a blend, wherein<br>
a blend of at least two different polymers or copolymers is used. It is preferred that in such<br>
a blend, at least one component of the blend reduces the final crystallinity of the<br>
manufactured object.<br>
Similar structural characteristics or modifications explained for PAEK can likewise be<br>
applied to alternative polymer or copolymer materials mentioned above.<br>
Furthermore, the powder may be a composite powder which comprises one or more filler(s)<br>
and/or additive(s) besides a matrix of the respective polymer, copolymer or blend. Fillers<br>
may be used to further improve the mechanical properties of the manufactured object. For<br>
example, fillers such as fibers, including but not limited to carbon fibers, glass fibers,<br>
Kevlar fibers, carbon nano fibers, or fillers having a low aspect ratio (glass beads,<br>
aluminum grit, etc.) or mineral fillers such as titane dioxide may be incorporated in the<br>
powder comprising at least one polymer or copolymer. Furthermore, process additives<br>
which improve the proccesability of the powder, e.g. free flowing agents such as the ones<br>
from the Aerosil series (e.g. Aerosil R974, Aerosil 200), or other functional additives, like<br>
heat stabilizers, oxidation stabilizers, color pigments (carbon black, graphite, etc.)) may be<br>
used.<br>
From the findings of the present invention it can be inferred generally that the following<br>
structural characteristics or modifications of polymers or copolymers favour limited<br>
crystallinity characteristics and thus are particularly preferred when a preselection of<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The crystallinity of the manufactured object can be determined by various methods that are<br>
well known to the person skilled in the art. The crystallinity can be determined based on<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) according to DIN 53765 which is used as a<br>
reference method according to the present invention. With the value of a theoretically 100%<br>
crystalline polymer which can be found in scientific publications, e.g. 130J/g for PEEK and<br>
160J/g for PEK (P C Dawson and D J Blundell, Polymer 1980,21, 577-578) it is possible to<br>
calculate the final crystallinity by the following formula:<br><br><br>
In case of objects manufactured from composite powders, i.e. a powder comprising one or<br>
more filler(s) or additive(s) besides of a polymer, a copolymer or a blend of polymers, the<br>
crystallinity value relates to the polymer matrix of the composite which can also be<br>
calculated as defined above.<br>
The crystallinity can also be determined by Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS)<br>
measurement. The procedure is well known by the person skilled in the art.<br>
As a reference method for the present invention, crystallinity was determined in the<br>
following Examples based on DSC measurements performed on a Mettler-Toledo DSC 823<br>
according to DIN 53765. The DSC sample was prepared from the middle of an ASTM<br>
D638 tensile bar that was built in x,y direction at least 5 cm from the edge of the<br>
exchangable frame on the laser sinter machine. Crystallinity was then determined by using<br>
the above shown formula.<br>
The density was measured according to ISO 1183 on a Kern 770-60 balance with a Satorius<br>
Density Determination Set YDK 01.<br>
Porosity is then calculated by the following formula:<br><br><br>
The density values for theoretically 100% crystalline PEEK (d100%=1-40 g/cmJ) and PEK<br>
(d100%=1-43 g/cmJ), as well as amorphous PEEK (d0%=1.265 g/cm3) and PEK (d00%o=1.272<br>
g/cm3) are well known in literature (P C Dawson and D J Blundell, Polymer 1980,21. 577-<br>
578)<br>
If the theoretical density values for the polymer is not known, the porosity can also be<br>
determined by micro-computerthomographie. A useful device is e.g. the U-CT40 supplied<br>
by SCANCO Medical AG, Briittisellen, Switzerland. The procedure is well known by the<br>
person skilled in the art.<br>
In the Examples, melt viscosity are determined according to US-Patent 2006/0251878 Al<br>
in a capillary viscosimeter with a wolfram-carbid nozzle at 400°C and a shear rate of 1000<br>
s-1.<br>
