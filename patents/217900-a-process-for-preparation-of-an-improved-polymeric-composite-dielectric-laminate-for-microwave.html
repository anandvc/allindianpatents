FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved polymeric dielectric composite laminate for applications such as microwave and a process for preparation thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A variety of polymeric composite materials are presently available for use as laminate for microwave electronic applications. Prevalent amongst these materials are composite systems based on fluoropolymers and specially polytclralluorocthylcne (PTFE). The microwave properties of PTFE are first realised in early 1950's. PTFE microwave laminates are made according to use/application. Addition of reinforcing materials into PTFE is intended to improve dimcnsonal stability, load-bearing capacity and to reduce the shrinkage, cold flow, wear properties etc. Glass and Ceramic reinforced PTFE laminates are most important for microwave applications.<br>
Laminates based on PTFE ceramic composite are designed for dimensional stability, low thermal expansion and low shrinkage. However, these PTFE ceramic composites, already known to the prior art, suffer from following disadvantages.<br>
Main disadvantage of such known PTFE ceramic composites is that these composites have high dielectric constant and as such they are suitable only for electronic and microwave circuit applications requiring high dielectric constant<br>
Another disadvantage of such known PTFE ceramic composites is that these composites have high dissipation factor.<br>
Another type of laminates Glass based microwave laminates are aimed for high reliability stripline and microstrip circuit applications. These glass based microwave laminates are again of basically three types.<br>
The first type of glass based composite laminate comprises of PTFE impregnated woven glass cloth. Such types of materials are known since early 1950's. Woven glass cloth reinforcement provides the dimensional stability of the laminate material. However, this also suffers from following disadvantages.<br>
Main disadvantage of such materials is that the dielectric constant of such materials varies according to thickness and PTFE constant.<br>
Another disadvantage of such materials is that these materials have poor flexibility and bending properties.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of such materials is that these materials have higher co¬efficient of thermal expansion in Z-axis as compared to the X-axis and Y-axis and as such these materials are unsuitable for many demanding microwave applications.<br><br>
The second type of glass based composite laminate comprises alternate layers of unreinforced PTFE and PTFE impregnated woven glass cot. This type of material offers low dielectric constant, low dissipation factor and better dimensional stability. However, because of presence of virgin PTFE layers, this laminate system suffers from poor foil adhesion and delimitation problems.<br>
The third type of composite laminate comprises homogeneous dielectric layer of random microfiber glass reinforced PTFE to make laminate with superior electrical performance. However, it also suffers from the disadvantage that it undergoes high dimensional change when subjected to processing.<br>

According to present invention, preparation of HILFON PTFE based polymeric composite dielectric laminate substrate comprises of following steps.<br>
(i) Preparation of PTFE powder<br>
Ultra fine white PTFE is derived from grinding of 1III FLON PTFE granular fibers. These granular fibers are made from suspension polymerisation of tetrafluoroethylene monomer.<br>
(ii) Blending of PTFE powder<br>
Initially, HIFON PTFE powder is taken into a clean mixer and is blended at around 18 °C till all the lumps are broken. Blending is clone to avoid the lump formation in the powder.<br>
(Hi) Mixing of Glass Powder<br>
In the next step, glass powder is added into the blended H1FLON PTFE Powder. Blending and mixing are carried out at 18 °C till the colour of the mix becomes white and homogeneous.<br>
(iv) Mixing of Molybdenum disulfide powder<br>
Molybdenum disulfide (MoSi) powder is added into the glass PTFE mixture. Blending and mixing are carried out at around 18 °C till the resultant composite powder mixture is homogeneous and has gray colour.<br>
(v) Compaction of composite laminate<br>
Finally, the PTFE composite, prepared in above manner, is distributed evenly into a square shaped stainless steel mould and is compacted at a pressure about 8 Kg/cm<br><br>
under a hydraulic press to remove entrapped air inside the powder. Next, the pressure is raised to about 350 Kg/cm 2<br>
(vi) Treatment of composite laminate substrate<br>
This compacted sheet is placed carefully into a programmable sintering oven. In the sintering oven, the temperature is raised up to 375 °C. Sintering is continued at this higher temperature (375 °C) for about 2 hours and is slowly cooled to room temperature.<br>
(vii) Preparation of composite laminate sheet<br>
The sintered sheet is again inserted in between two stainless steel (SS) plates of a hot hydraulic press and heated at temperature 300 °C. At this temperature, the composite sheet is compacted at a pressure 200 kg/cm2 and is decompressed slowly. The hot pressed sheet is cooled slowly to room temperature and taken out from the stainless steel plates. The edges of the laminate substrate sheet are trimmed by using a sharp knife.<br>
The process of the present invention will now be illustrated by specific working examples. It is to be understood that the working examples provided herein are by way of illustration and are not intended to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the invention.<br>
WORKING EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
About 74.73 gin of HIFLON PTFE powder is taken into a clean mixer and is blended at around 18°C. To this about 24.91 gm of glass powder is added and mixing is carried out at about l5 °C till the colour of the mixture becomes uniformly white. Next, about 0.36 m of molybdenum disulfide powder is added arid again blending is carried out at around 18 °C to produce a gray colour homogeneous mixture. The weight of the composite powder is 100 gm. The said composite mixture is distributed evenly into a square shaped stainless steel mould with a size of about 203 mm x 203 mm x 50 mm . The powder is compacted under hydraulic press at room temperature at a pressure of 8 kg/cm2 to remove the entrapped air and again at a final pressure of 300 kg/cm2 and is then decompressed. The compacted sheet is placed into a sintering oven. In the oven, the sheet is heated at around 375°C for about 2 hours and is slowly cooled to room temperature.<br>
Next, the sintered PTFE composite sheet is inserted in between two stainless steel plates of a hot hydraulic press each having the size of about 203 mm x 203 mm x 20 mm, and temperature is raised up to 300 °C. At 300 °C the composite substrate sheet is compressed at a pressure of 200 kg/cm2 and then the pressure is released. The compacted sheet is allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. After cooling, the sheet is removed<br>
from the SS plate and all the edges of laminate substrate sheet are trimmed by using a sharp knife to desired dimension (200 mm x 200 mm x 0.8 mm). The composite dielectric laminate substrate sheet is gray colour with smooth surface finish. Final weight of the sheet is 70 gm.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
5231.10 gm (74.73% by wt) of HIFLON PTFF powder is taken into a clean mixture and is blended at 18 C. To this 1743.7 gm (24.91 % by wt) of glass powder is added and mixing is carried out at 18 °C till the colour of the mixture becomes uniformly white. To this mix, 25.20 gm (0.36% by wt) of molybdenum disulfide powder is added and again mixing is carried out at the same temperature (18 °C) to produce a gray colour homogeneous mixture. The weight of the composite powder is 7000 gm.<br>
PTFE composite mix is distributed evenly into a cylindrical mould (inner dia 150 mm) assembled with a central mandrel (dia 50 mm). The powder is compacted under hydraulic press at room temperature at a pressure of 8 kg/cm to remove the entrapped air and again at a final pressure of 350 kg/cm2. Next, it is decompressed slowly. The compacted PTFE bush is taken out from the mould carefully.<br>
The compacted PTFE bush is placed into a sintering oven and heated at a temperature is 375 °C for 4 hours and then it is cooled to room temperature and is taken out from the oven. The sintered PTFE based composite bush of size 147.5 mm (outer dia) x 49.2 mm (inner dia) x 206 mm (height) is skived in the form of continuous sheet of thickness 1.2 mm and width 206 mm using a special type of skiving lathe machine. Above skived sheet is cut into pieces of length 206 mm and width 206 mm and sintered once again at 375 °C for one hour and cooled to room temperature.<br>
Next, the re-sintered PTFE composite sheet piece is inserted in between two SS plates (each 203 mm length x 203 mm width x 20 mm height) of hot hydraulic press and temperature is raised to 300 °C. At 300 C the composite substrate sheet is compressed at a pressure of 200 kg/cm2 and then the pressure is released. The compacted sheet is then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature. After cooling, the sheet is removed from the SS plate and then all the edges of laminate substrate sheet are trimmed by using a sharp knife to desired dimensions (Length 200 mm x width 200 mm w x thickness 0.8 mm). The finally prepared composite dielectric laminate substrate sheet is of gray colour having smooth surface finish.<br>
