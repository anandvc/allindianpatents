MESSAGE-BASED EXPENSE APPLICATION<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]    The present invention generally relates to expense reports and more particularly to<br>
apparatus and methods for processing expense reports in response to messages received<br>
through a messaging channel.<br>
[0002]    When an employee of a company incurs an expense that is reimbursable, the<br>
employee typically fills out an expense report. A user may typically incur expenses when<br>
traveling. During a trip, a user will have to keep track of any expenses that are incurred.<br>
When the user returns from the trip, the user may use his/her records in order to fill out an<br>
expense report. An expense application may be used where the employee can interact with<br>
the application that has been installed on a computing device in order to fill out an expense<br>
report for reimbursement.<br>
[0003]    The above process includes many disadvantages. For example, the expense<br>
application that is used is typically installed on a corporation's computer network. Thus, a<br>
user needs to access the corporate network using a computer to use the expense application.<br>
In some cases, access to the network is not available while traveling and thus a user cannot<br>
fill out an expense report using the expense application.<br>
[0004]    Also, when a user is traveling, it may be burdensome to keep track of all the<br>
expenses that are incurred. This is especially true if a user travels often or is on a long<br>
business trip. Additionally, when many expenses are incurred, there is a chance that a user<br>
may lose records of the expenses or forget to record that an expense was incurred.<br>
Accordingly, a user may not be properly reimbursed for incurred expenses.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]    The present invention generally relates to an expense application capable of<br>
processing messages in order to update an expense report.<br>
[0006]    In one embodiment, a method for managing an expense report for an expense report<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019]    Fig. 1 depicts a system 100 for managing an expense report according to one<br>
embodiment of the present invention. In one embodiment, system 100 includes one or more<br>
messaging devices 102, a messaging server 104, and one or more applications 106.<br>
[0020]    Messaging devices 102 include any devices that can send messages through<br>
messaging channels. A messaging channel is a channel in which messages of a certain<br>
format or protocol may be sent. For example, the messaging formats may be short message<br>
service (SMS), multimedia service (MMS), voice, email, instant message (IM), facsimile, etc.<br>
In one example, SMS messages may be sent through an SMS messaging channel. Also,<br>
MMS messages may be sent through an MMS messaging channel. Each messaging channel<br>
may require a different protocol or format in order to send the messages through the channel.<br>
[0021]    Messaging devices 102 may include cellular phones, personal digital assistants<br>
(PDAs), personal computers, workstations, fax machines, plain old telephone service (POTS)<br>
telephones, etc. Messaging devices 102 are configured to send messages through messaging<br>
channels. For example, an SMS device sends messages through an SMS channel. Also, a<br>
messaging device 102 may be configured to send messages through multiple messaging<br>
channels. For example, a cellular phone may be configured to send SMS and MMS messages<br>
through SMS and MMS messaging channels.<br>
[0022]    Messaging server 104 is configured to receive messages from messaging devices<br>
102. In one embodiment, messaging server 104 can process messages that are received from<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
multiple messaging channels. For example, messaging server 104 may process messages in<br>
the following formats: SMS, MMS, voice, email, IM, fax, SOAP, etc. A person of skill in the<br>
art will appreciate other messaging formats that can be processed by messaging server 104.<br>
[0023]    Messaging server 104 is also configured to send messages received from messaging<br>
devices 102 to application 106. Messaging server 104 may identify the application first. For<br>
example, the application may be identified based on an address to whom the message was<br>
sent or an address from which the message was sent. Messages received from messaging<br>
devices 102 may include expense information. The expense information may be information<br>
that should be used to update an expense report (e.g. add an expense item, delete or change an<br>
expense item). For example, a user may send a message to messaging server 104 that<br>
indicates that an expense report should be updated with certain expense information.<br>
Messaging server 104 is configured to determine an expense application 106. Once the<br>
application 106 is determined, the message is sent with the expense information to<br>
application 106.<br>
[0024]    In one embodiment, messaging server 104 and messaging devices 102 may engage<br>
in a conversation. For example, multiple messages may be sent back and forth among<br>
messaging devices 102, messaging server 104, and application 106. The messages may be<br>
used to determine an action to perform (such as updating an expense report). For example, a<br>
user may send a first message from a messaging device to messaging server 104 indicating an<br>
expense report to update. Messaging server 104 may then send a message asking what type<br>
of expense was incurred. Also, messaging server 104 may contact application 106, which<br>
then may send a message asking for any additional information that is needed from<br>
messaging devices 102 (e.g., distance travel for a mileage expense or rental agreement<br>
number for a rental car expense). This process may continue until information needed by<br>
application 106 is determined. The amount of iteration may vary significantly depending on<br>
the channel and the amount of information that can be provided per message. For example,<br>
in a MMS, email, and voice, all the information may be provided and dialog is needed only if<br>
the information is incorrect or not understandable; but via SMS it may be chunked into<br>
smaller data entries in multiple messages.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
[0025]   Embodiments of messaging server 104 are described in more detail in U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 10/687,219, entitled "Actionable Messaging," filed on October 15,2003,<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference in full for all purposes.<br>
[0026]    One or more applications 106 may include any expense applications. Application<br>
106 is configured to receive a message from messaging devices 102 and, in response,<br>
configured to update an expense report. For example, application 106 may use the expense<br>
information in order to determine if an expense report should be updated. Then, entry<br>
information is determined from the expense information and an entry is updated with the<br>
entry information in the determined expense report.<br>
[0027]    Accordingly, application 106 is configured to perform actions in response to<br>
messages from messaging devices ] 02. A user may send messages using messaging devices<br>
102 to application 106. Application 106 is then configured to update an expense report with<br>
information in the message. Accordingly, a user may update an expense report at any time.<br>
For example, when a user incurs an expense while traveling, the user can send a message,<br>
such as an SMS message, through a messaging channel from a cellular phone to application<br>
106. Application 106 can then update a user's expense report based on the information sent<br>
in the message. Thus, an expense report can be updated without having a user directly access<br>
the application. In one embodiment, directly access is having a user open the application and<br>
update the expense report using the opened application.<br>
[0028]    Fig. 2 depicts a simplified flowchart 200 of a method for processing messages for an<br>
expense application according to one embodiment of the present invention. In step 202,<br>
messaging server 104 receives a message.with expense information from a messaging device<br>
102. The message may be received through any messaging channel mentioned above. In one<br>
embodiment, a user may be mobile. For example, a user may be mobile in that direct access<br>
to application 106 installed on a computing device may not be possible. Accordingly, a user<br>
may use a messaging device 102 to generate a message to send to application 106.<br>
[0029]    The generated message may include expense information. The expense information<br>
may describe the expense incurred. For example, expense information may be an expense<br>
identifier (e.g., a business trip), a category identifier (e.g., food), an amount, and any other<br>
information required to update an expense report.<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
[0030J    A message may be free form in that a user may not need any forms that are required<br>
by application 106 to fill out an expense report. For example, a user may generate an email<br>
or SMS message that includes the above information. Identifiers may be used to indicate<br>
what the information is. For example, an expense identifier may be sent with information<br>
indicating that it is an expense identifier. Also, the messages may be sent in a certain form,<br>
where an expense identifier, category identifier, and amount may be specified. An example<br>
of a message that may be sent includes:<br><cat>Toll5GBP<date>20030204</date>
&gt;<com>London Bridge</com>.<br>
The message above indicates an expense category of Toll for an amount of 5 GBP on the date<br>
of 20030204 at the London bridge. In another embodiment, using voice, the message can be<br>
free form such that the message is appropriately understood / interpreted by a dialog manager<br>
(e.g., a user or voice response system).<br>
[0031]    In one embodiment, authentication of the user may be performed. For example, a<br>
password may be verified. Also, a password challenge, phone ID (mobile station integrated<br>
service digital network (MISDN), phone number EMEI, or other identification may be<br>
required.<br>
[0032]    In step 204, messaging server 104 determines an expense application that is<br>
applicable for the message. Messaging server 104 may determine the expense application<br>
106 based on the message sent. For example, a user that sent the message may use a certain<br>
application 106 that is associated with the user. Messaging server 104 may determine that the<br>
user uses the certain application 106 using a user ID, such as an email address or phone<br>
number, for the user. Also, the message may specify which expense application 106 to use.<br>
For example, the identifier for the expense application may be included in the message.<br>
Additionally, messaging server 104 may be configured to only send messages to a single<br>
application 106. Thus, any expense messages received by messaging server 104 may be<br>
forwarded to the single application 106.<br>
[0033]    In step 206, messaging server 104 sends the expense information to the expense<br>
application 106 determined in step 204. In one embodiment, the message may be forwarded<br>
to application 106. In another embodiment, the applicable expense information may be<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
parsed from the message and sent to application 106 in a certain format. For example,<br>
different messaging devices 102 may send messages in different formats. The expense<br>
information may then be parsed out of the messages and formatted in a certain format that<br>
application 106 may recognize. For example, application 106 may be configured to respond<br>
to a command in a certain format. Messaging server 104 may be configured to generate a<br>
command in a certain format based on expense information received in messages sent in<br>
different formats.<br>
[0034]    Fig. 3 depicts of simplified flowchart 300 of a method for processing a message<br>
received from messaging devices 102 using an expense report application 106 according to<br>
one embodiment of the present invention. In step 302, a message is received with expense<br>
information. In one embodiment, the message is received from messaging server 104. In<br>
another embodiment, the message may be received directly from messaging devices 102.<br>
[0035]    In step 304, an identifier for an expense report is determined. For example, the<br>
message may be for a certain expense report. An expense report identifier may be<br>
determined from the expense information that indicates which expense report to access.<br>
Also, a user identifier may be used to determine the expense report. For example, a user may<br>
have a default expense report associated with an identifier, such as the user's username, phone<br>
number, email address, etc. The expense report associated with the identifier that sent the<br>
message may then be determined.<br>
[0036]    In step 306, application 106 determines entry information for the expense report.<br>
For example, the message received may include information that should be used to update an<br>
expense report. For example, an expense identifier, category identifier, and amount may be<br>
specified in the message. That information is determined from the message.<br>
[0037]    Also, expenses may be also be compiled in a single "repository" for the user and the<br>
user can then pick which expenses to group in a report or when to commit the expenses to an<br>
expense report. This may be done using messaging.<br>
[0038]    In step 308, application 106 updates the expense report with the entry information.<br>
For example, application 106 may create a new entry in an active expense report with the<br>
entry information. If the entry information indicated that a travel expense report with a<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PC1YUS2005/042442<br>
category of food should be entered with the amount of $33.00, that entry is added to the<br>
travel expense report.<br>
[0039]    Although the above method is described as updating an existing expense report for a<br>
user, it will be recognized that application 106 may update an expense report by creating a<br>
new expense report for the user. For example, if an existing expense report is not found, a<br>
new expense report may be created and entry information in the new expense report is<br>
updated with the entry information.<br>
(0040]    Accordingly, application 106 is configured to receive a message through a<br>
messaging channel and update an expense report with entry information determined from the<br>
message. Thus, users may send messages while they are remotely located from a device that<br>
can directly access application 106. When a user is mobile, certain messaging channels may<br>
be easily accessible. For example, sending an SMS message to application 106 may be more<br>
convenient than finding computer that includes access to application 106. Accordingly,<br>
messaging channels that are easily accessed while a user is mobile may be used in order to<br>
update an expense report.<br>
[0041]    In addition to updating expense reports with entry information, system 100 may also<br>
enable other features to be performed with application 106. For example, the user may send a<br>
message to messaging devices 102 that requests an action from application 106. For<br>
example, a user may check or review an expense report by having the expense report sent to<br>
him/her, etc. Also, if an expense report is sent to a messaging device 102, a user can then<br>
complete any missing information, also to select what items to apply (add) to a report from a<br>
list of entered expense items, edit the expense report, and then send the report back to<br>
application 106.<br>
[0042]    Also, a user may submit an expense report for approval using messaging devices<br>
102. A user may send a message requesting that application 106 submit the expense report<br>
for approval. Accordingly, a user may submit an expense report while the user is still on<br>
vacation or traveling, or anywhere where the user is remotely located from a device that<br>
allows direct access application 106.<br>
[0043]    Fig. 4 depicts a simplified flowchart 400 of a method for submitting an expense<br>
report for approval using messaging according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
In one embodiment, the steps described herein may all be performed using messaging<br>
through any messaging channels.<br>
[0044]    In step 402, application 106 receives a command to submit an expense report for<br>
approval. The command may be received from messaging devices 102 through a messaging<br>
channel. For example, an SMS message may be sent indicating that a certain expense report<br>
should be submitted for approval.<br>
(0045)    In step 404, application 106 generates a completed expense report. For example, all<br>
entries in the expense report are used to generate a final expense report.<br>
[0046]    In step 406, the expense report is sent to the user for a final approval. For example,<br>
a user may need to authorize that the expense report should be submitted for approval. In one<br>
example, a digital signature may be added to the expense report. Also, a user may want to<br>
review the expense report to determine if any information is missing or needs to be edited. In<br>
one embodiment, this step may be omitted if a user does not need to provide a final approval.<br>
[0047]    In step 408, an approval is received from a user to submit the generated expense<br>
report. For example, a user may use messaging devices 102 to send a message through a<br>
messaging channel to application 106 indicating that the expense report should be submitted<br>
for approval. The approval may be received in a message that includes a digital signature<br>
from the user. Also, a message that just indicates that the expense report should be submitted<br>
may be sent. For example, a text message may be sent that says "expense report X approved<br>
for submission".<br>
[0048]    In step 410, application 106 submits the expense report for approval. For example,<br>
an expense report may need to be approved by a manager of the user. An expense report may<br>
be then sent to the manager. For example, the report may be sent through email, messaging,<br>
or any other electronic methods to the manager. Also, a message may be sent to the manager<br>
indicating that the manager should access the report and provide an approval.<br>
[0049]    In step 412, an approval for the expense report is received. For example, a manager<br>
may send a message through a messaging device 102 that indicates the expense report is<br>
approved. Also, a manager may access application 106 and indicate that the expense report is<br>
approved (or rejection) by answering the message. Similarly, the manager can use messaging<br>
to ask for more details for an expense.<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
[0050]    In step 414, application 106 sends a request for reimbursement for the expense<br>
report. For example, a message may be sent to an entity responsible for reimbursement, such<br>
as an accounting department. Any requirements that are needed in order to have an expense<br>
report reimbursed may be adhered to. For example, all the necessary signatures or approvals<br>
may be included on the expense report. A digital signature from the user who submitted the<br>
expense report and digital signatures for the approval may be included on the expense report<br>
sent to the reimbursement entity by application 106.<br>
[0051]    The user associated with the expense report may then be reimbursed. For example,<br>
the accounting department may have a check for reimbursement sent to the user or have<br>
money directly deposited in the user's bank account. In some cases, receipts may have to be<br>
later submitted or any other requirements that are needed for reimbursement that cannot be<br>
done by messaging may have to be performed by the user. If legally acceptable, the receipts<br>
may also be faxed, printed, scanned, or photographed and sent via e-mail, fax, MMS, etc.<br>
[0052]    Accordingly, a user may use messaging devices 102 in order to have an expense<br>
report submitted for approval and reimbursement. For example, a user may, while traveling,<br>
decide that an expense report should be submitted. In one example, a user may be traveling<br>
from city to city and when the user departs one city, the user may want to submit an expense<br>
report for that city. Accordingly, when the user returns from traveling, a reimbursement<br>
check for that part of the trip may have already been generated. Conventionally, a user would<br>
have to wait until returning from traveling in order to access application 106 and submit the<br>
expense report. However, using embodiments of the present invention, a user may use<br>
messaging channels in order to have an expense report submitted for approval and for<br>
reimbursement.<br>
[0053]    An example using embodiments of the present invention will now be described. A<br>
user may be traveling and incur an expense, such as a taxi fare. The user may use a<br>
messaging device to send an SMS message (or any other message) through a messaging<br>
channel to application 106. The SMS message may include an expense report (e.g., Seoul,<br>
May 2004), an expense category (taxi), an expense amount ($5,000 YUAN), and a remark<br>
(hotel cab fare to meeting).<br>
[0054]    Messaging server 104 receives the SMS message and determines an application 106<br>
in which to send the message. Application 106 would then receive the message and<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/060254	PCT/US2005/042442<br>
determine the expense report, i.e., a May 2004 Seoul expense report. Entry information such<br>
as expense category, expense amount, and remarks are then determined from the message.<br>
An entry is then added to the May 2004 Seoul expense report of a taxi expense of $5,000<br>
KWONs with the remark that the expense was a hotel cab fare to a meeting.<br>
[0055]    If needed, multiple SMS messages may be sent. For example, messaging server 104<br>
or application 106 may engage in a conversation in which information for the expense report<br>
may be determined. For example, application 106 may ask what the date the expense was<br>
incurred on, etc. A user may answer the question by sending another message to application<br>
106.<br>
[0056]    Accordingly, a user may have an expense report updated immediately after<br>
incurring the expense. Also, a user may send a message at the end of a day detailing all the<br>
expenses that were incurred during the day. This may be done by sending messages using<br>
any messaging channels.<br>
[0057]    Embodiments of the present invention provide many advantages. For example, a<br>
user does not have to wait until returning from a trip to file an expense report. Rather, a user<br>
while traveling may use messaging channels that are easily accessible to send messages to an<br>
application 106. The application 106 is then configured to update an expense report based on<br>
the message. Thus, a convenient way of entering information in expense applications is<br>
provided. Users while being mobile may have access to messaging devices, such as SMS<br>
devices, MMS devices, etc., more so than a device that is configured to directly access<br>
application 106. Accordingly, messages may be sent that are interpreted by application 106<br>
in order to update an expense report. Thus, an easy method of compiling an expense report is<br>
provided and may be used by a user while being mobile.<br>
