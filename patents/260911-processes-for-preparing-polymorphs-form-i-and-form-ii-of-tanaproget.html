				<td>POLYMORPH FORM II OF TANAPROGET<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A novel tanaproget polymorph Form II and compositions containing the same<br>
are provided as described herein.<br>
Intracellular receptors (IR) form a class of structurally related gene regulators<br>
known as "ligand dependent transcription factors". The steroid receptor family is a<br>
subset of the IR family, including progesterone receptor (PR), estrogen receptor<br>
(ER), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), and mineralocorticoid<br>
receptor (MR).<br>
The natural hormone, or ligand, for the PR is the steroid progesterone, but<br>
synthetic compounds, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate or levonorgestrel, have<br>
been made which also serve as ligands. Once a ligand is present in the fluid<br>
surrounding a cell, it passes through the membrane via passive diffusion, and binds to<br>
the IR to create a receptor/ligand complex. This complex binds to specific gene<br>
promoters present in the cell's DNA. Once bound to the DNA the complex<br>
modulates die production of mRNA and protein encoded by that gene.<br>
A compound that binds to an IR and mimics the action of the natural hormone<br>
is termed an agonist, whilst a compound which inhibits the effect of the hormone is<br>
an antagonist.<br>
PR agonists (natural and synthetic) are known to play an important role in the<br>
health of women. PR agonists are used in birth control compositions, typically in the<br>
presence of an ER agonist, alternatively they may be used in conjunction with a PR<br>
antagonist. ER agonists are used to treat the symptoms of menopause, but have been<br>
associated with a proliferative effect on the uterus which can lead to an increased risk<br>
of uterine cancers. Co-administration of a PR agonist reduces/ablates that risk.<br>
Tanaproget, 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1 -benzoxazin-6-yl)-1H-<br>
pyrrole-2-carbonitrile, is a progesterone receptor modulator and is effective in<br>
contraception, hormone replacement therapy, and treating carcinomas and<br>
adenocarcinomas, dysfunctional bleeding, uterine leiomyomata, endometriosis, and<br>
polycystic ovary syndrome.<br><br>
What is needed in the art are alternate forms of tanaproget.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A novel polymorph of tanaproget, denoted herein as Form II, is described.<br>
Form II differs from Form I in the structure of the crystal lattice of tanaproget Form I<br>
and in its chemical properties.<br>
As used herein, "tanaproget" or "Form I" refers to tanaproget, i.e., 5-(4,4-<br>
dimethyl-2-thioxo-1,4-dihydro-2H-3,1 -benzoxazin-6-yl)-1 -methyl- lH-pyrrole-2-<br>
carbonitrile, regardless of particle size or purity. Tanaproget can be purified<br>
according to the procedure set forth in US Patent Application Publication No. US<br>
2005-0272702 Al, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, tanaproget Form I is purified by recrystallization.<br>
Desirably, the tanaproget is recrystallized from acetone and water. More desirably,<br>
the tanaproget is dissolved in acetone, the acetone solution heated, water added to the<br>
heated acetone solution, and the acetone/water solution cooled to provide purified<br>
tanaproget. This purification specifically includes dissolving crude tanaproget in<br>
acetone and heating the solution to about 45 to about 51 Â°C. After circulating the<br>
heated solution through a carbon filter for at least about 4 hours, the filtered solution<br>
was concentrated using procedures known to those of skill in the art. After adding<br>
water to the concentrated solution, desirably at a rate which does not cool the<br>
refluxirig acetone solution, the acetone/water solution is cooled to about -6 to about<br>
0Â°C. Desirably, the acetone/water solution is cooled at a rate of less than about 0.5<br>
Â°C/rninute. After holding the batch at the reduced temperature for at least about 3<br>
hours, the precipitated, purified tanaproget is collected using filtration. The collected<br>
solid is washed with a water/acetone mixture, desirably washing the solid twice with<br>
a 1:1 water/acetone mixture. The washed purified tanaproget is then dried at less<br>
than 35 Â°C for about 4 hours. Further drying at less than about 50 Â°C is performed to<br>
remove residual acetone/water as measured by spectroscopic methods.<br>
"Tanaproget" or "Form I" also refers to both non-micronized and micronized<br>
forms of the same. Micronization of tanaproget is typically accomplished under<br>
nitrogen and conventional micronizing techniques, for example with a Trost or jet<br>
mill, applied to non-micronized tanaproget. One method of preparation of non-<br>
micronized tanaproget is described in US Patent No. 6,436,929 and another is<br>
3<br><br>
generally described in US Patent Application Publication No. US-2005-0272702-A1,<br>
which are hereby incorporated by reference. Desirably, the non-micronized<br>
tanaproget is prepared as described in US Patent Application Publication No. US-<br>
2005-0272702-A1. However, the novel polymorph Form II is not limited to the<br>
method by which the non-micronized tanaproget is produced.<br>
Micronized tanaproget prepared or used typically has a particle size of less<br>
than about 20 (im, and desirably less than about 15 jjnn. Desirably, 90% of the<br>
particles are less than or equal to about 20 tm and 50% are less than or equal to about<br>
15 JMTI, and more desirably less than about 10 (im, as determined by the Malvern<br>
method, which is readily understood by one of skill in the art. More desirably, most<br>
of the particles are less than or equal to about 10 fim.<br>
A.	Spectroscopic Identification of Form II<br>
Tanaproget Form I has a differential scanning calorimetry thermogram which<br>
includes an endotherm peak of about 230Â°C. Further, the X-ray diffraction (XRD)<br>
pattern contains peaks at 20 of about 6.6Â°, 10.3Â°, 14.4Â°, 19.8Â°, 23.8Â°, 26.3Â°, and<br>
29.1Â°.<br>
The XRD pattern of tanaproget polymorph Form II differs from the XRD<br>
pattern of Form I and includes peaks at 20 of about 6.0Â°, 8.3Â°, 12.0Â°, 21.4Â°, and<br>
23.4Â°. See, Figure 1. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermogram of<br>
Form II also differs from the DSC thermogram of Form I and has a Tonset of about<br>
219Â°C. See, Figure 2.<br>
B.	Preparing the Form II Tanaproget Polymorph<br>
The Form II tanaproget polymorph is typically prepared by recrystallizrng<br>
non-micronized or micronized tanaproget Form I from selected solvent systems.<br>
Preferred solvent systems for use in preparing Form II include, without limitation,<br>
the methylene chloride and pentane solvent system; the acetonitrile and water solvent<br>
system; and the methanol and water solvent system.<br>
4<br><br>
(i) The Methylene Chloride/Pentane Solvent System<br>
In one embodiment, Form II is prepared using the methylene<br>
chloride/pentane solvent system. In this process, Form I is dissolved in methylene<br>
chloride and optionally warmed to temperatures of about reflux temperatures. The<br>
methylene chloride solution is then optionally concentrated and pentane is added.<br>
The pentane can be layered onto the methylene chloride solution and mixed therein<br>
or mixed directly into the methylene chloride solution. The methylene<br>
chloride/pentane solution is thereby cooled, desirably to about 20Â°C. By doing so,<br>
tanaproget polymorph Form II precipitates from the methylene chloride/pentane<br>
solution and is collected using techniques known in the art. The collected Form II<br>
can then be dried using techniques known in the art and include the use of reduced<br>
pressures and elevated temperatures, among other techniques.<br>
(ii) The Acetonitrile/Water Solvent System<br>
In another embodiment, Form II is prepared using the<br>
acetonitrile/water solvent system. In this process, Form I is dissolved in acetonitrile,<br>
optionally warmed to temperatures of about reflux temperatures. The acetonitrile<br>
solution is then optionally concentrated and water is added. The water can be layered<br>
onto the acetonitrile solution and mixed therein or mixed directly into the acetonitrile<br>
solution. The acetonitrile/water solution is thereby cooled, desirably to room<br>
temperature or below. By doing so, tanaproget polymorph Form II precipitates from<br>
the acetonitrile/water solution and is collected using techniques known in the art.<br>
The collected Form II can then be dried using techniques known in the art and<br>
include the use of reduced pressures and elevated temperatures, among other<br>
techniques.<br>
(iii) The Methanol/Water Solvent System<br>
In a further embodiment, Form II is prepared using the<br>
methanol/water solvent system, hi this process, Form I is dissolved in methanol,<br>
optionally warmed to temperatures of about reflux temperatures. The methanol<br>
solution is then optionally concentrated and water is added. The water can be layered<br>
5<br><br>
onto the methanol solution and mixed therein or mixed directly into the methanol<br>
solution. The methanol/water solution is thereby cooled, desirably to room<br>
temperature or below. By doing so. tanaproget polymorph Form II precipitates from<br>
the methanol/water solution and is collected using techniques known in the art. The<br>
collected Form II can then be dried using techniques known in the art and include the<br>
use of reduced pressures and elevated temperatures, among other techniques.<br>
C.	Micronized Tanaproget Form II<br>
Tanaproget Form II can be micronized under nitrogen and conventional<br>
micronizing techniques, for example with a Trost or jet mill, as discussed above for<br>
micronized tanaproget Form I.<br>
Micronized tanaproget Form II typically has a median particle size of less<br>
than about 20 /mi, desirably less than about 15 /im, and more desirably less than<br>
about 10 /Am. Specifically, 90% of the particles are less than or equal to about 20 /xm<br>
and 50% are less than or equal to about 15 iim as determined by the Malvern method,<br>
which is readily understood by one of skill in the art.<br>
In one embodiment, micronized 5-(4,4-dimethyl-2-thioxo-l,4-dihydro-2H-<br>
3,l-benzoxazin-6-yl)-l-methyl-lH-pyrrole-2-carbonitrile Form II having a particle<br>
size less than about 20 jura is provided.<br>
D.	Compositions Containing the Form II Tanaproget Polymorph<br>
Also provided are compositions, desirably pharmaceutical compositions,<br>
containing tanaproget polymorph Form II alone or in combination with Form I. The<br>
compositions typically contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, but can also<br>
contain other suitable components. Typically, the additional components are inert<br>
and do not interfere with the function of the required components of the<br>
compositions. The compositions can thereby further include other adjuvants, syrups,<br>
elixirs, diluents, binders, lubricants, surfactants, granulating agents, disintegrating<br>
agents, emollients, metal chelators, pH adjustors, surfactants, fillers, disintegrants,<br>
and combinations thereof, among others.<br>

including edetic acid, malic acid, or fumaric acid. In one embodiment, the metal<br>
chelator is edetic acid.<br>
7<br><br>
pH adjusters can also be utilized to adjust the pH of a solution containing<br>
tanaproget to about 4 to about 6. In one embodiment, the pH of a solution containing<br>
tanaproget is adjusted to a pH of about 4,6. pH adjusters can include physiologically<br>
acceptable agents including citric acid, ascorbic acid, fumaric acid, or malic acid, and<br>
salts thereof. In one embodiment, the pH adjuster is citric acid.<br>
Additional fillers that can be used in the composition include mannitol,<br>
calcium phosphate, pregelatinized starch, or sucrose.<br>
E. Methods of Using the Form II Tanaproget Polymorph<br>
Further provided are methods of delivering tanaproget polymorph Form II to<br>
a patient, where the method includes administering Form II.<br>
The dosage requirements of Form II may vary based on the severity of the<br>
symptoms presented and the particular subject being treated. Treatment can be<br>
initiated with small dosages less than the optimum dose of Form II. Thereafter the<br>
dosage is increased until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached.<br>
Precise dosages will be determined by the administering physician based on<br>
experience with the individual subject treated. In general, Form II is most desirably<br>
administered at a concentration that will generally afford effective results without<br>
causing any unacceptable harmful or deleterious side effects. For example, an<br>
effective amount of Form II is generally, e.g., about 0.05 mg to about 1 mg, about<br>
0.05 mg to about 0.3 mg, about 0.05 mg, about 0.075 mg, about 0.1 mg, about 0.15<br>
mg, about 0.2 mg, or about 0.3 mg.<br>
Form II is therefore useful in contraception and hormone replacement<br>
therapy. Form II is also useful in contraception and the treatment and/or prevention<br>
of uterine myometrial fibroids, benign prostatic hypertrophy, benign and malignant<br>
neoplastic disease, dysfunctional bleeding, uterine leiomyomata, endometriosis,<br>
polycystic ovary syndrome, and carcinomas and adenocarcinomas of the pituitary,<br>
endometrium, kidney, ovary, breast, colon, and prostate and other hormone-<br>
dependent tumors. Additional uses of Form H include stimulation of food intake.<br>
Tanaproget polymorph Form II can be formulated in any form suitable for the<br>
desired route of delivery using a pharmaceutically effective amount of Form II. For<br>
8<br><br>
example, Form II can be delivered by a route such as oral, dermal, transdermal,<br>
intrabronchial, intranasal, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, parenteral,<br>
intraperitoneal, intranasal, vaÂ°inal, rectal, sublingual, intracranial, epidural,<br>
intratracheal, or by sustained release. Desirably, delivery is oral.<br>
For example, Form II may be formulated for administration orally in such<br>
forms as tablets, capsules, microcapsules, dispersible powders, granules, or<br>
suspensions containing, for example, from about 0.05 to 5% of suspending agent,<br>
syrups containing, for example, from about 10 to 50% of sugar, and elixirs<br>
containing, for example, from about 20 to 50% ethanol, and the like. The preferred<br>
pharmaceutical compositions from the standpoint of ease of preparation and<br>
administration are solid compositions, particularly tablets and hard-filled or liquid-<br>
filled capsules.<br>
Form H may also be administered parenterally or mtraperitoneally. Solutions<br>
or suspensions of Form II can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant<br>
such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid,<br>
polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of<br>
storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of<br>
microorganisms. Typically, such sterile injectable solutions or suspensions contain<br>
from about 0.05 to 5% suspending agent in an isotonic medium. Such<br>
pharmaceutical preparations may contain, for example, from about 25 to about 90%<br>
of the active ingredient in combination with the carrier, more usually between about<br>
5% and 60% by weight.<br>
In another embodiment, Form II is delivered intravenously, intramuscularly,<br>
subcutaneously, parenterally and intraperitoneally in the form of sterile injectable<br>
solutions, suspensions, dispersions, and powders which are fluid to the extent that<br>
easy syringe ability exits. Such injectable compositions are sterile, stable under<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage, and free of the contaminating action of<br>
microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.<br>
The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example,<br>
water, ethanol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), oils,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Desirably the liquid carrier is water. In one embodiment, the<br>
9<br><br>
oil is vegetable oil. Optionally, the liquid carrier contains a suspending agent. In<br>
another embodiment, the liquid carrier is an isotonic medium and contains 0.05 to<br>
about 5% suspending agent.<br>
In a further embodiment, Form II is delivered rectally in the form of a<br>
conventional suppository.<br>
In another embodiment, Form II is delivered vaginally in the form of a<br>
conventional suppository, cream, gel, ring, or coated intrauterine device (IUD).<br>
In yet another embodiment, Form II is delivered intranasally or<br>
intrabronchially in the form of an aerosol.<br>
In a further embodiment, Form II is delivered transdermally or by sustained<br>
release through the use of a transdermal patch containing Form II and an optional<br>
carrier that is inert to Form n, is nontoxic to the skin, and allows for delivery of Form.<br>
II for systemic absorption into the blood stream. Such a carrier can be a cream,<br>
ointment, paste, gel, or occlusive device. The creams and ointments can be viscous<br>
liquid or semisolid emulsions. Pastes include absorptive powders dispersed in<br>
petroleum or hydrophilic petroleum. Further, a variety of occlusive devices can be<br>
utilized to release Form II into the blood stream and include semi-permeable<br>
membranes covering a reservoir contain the active reagents, or a matrix containing<br>
the reactive reagents.<br>
The use of sustained delivery devices can be desirable, in order to avoid the<br>
necessity for the patient to take medications on a daily basis. The term "sustained<br>
delivery" is used herein to refer to delaying the release of an active agent, i.e.,<br>
tanaproget polymorph Form n, until after placement in a delivery environment,<br>
followed by a sustained release of the agent at a later time. A number of sustained<br>
delivery devices are known in the art and include hydrogels (US Patent Nos.<br>
5,266,325; 4,959,217; 5,292,515), osmotic pumps (US Patent Nos. 4,295,987 and<br>
5,273,752 and European Patent No. 314,206, among others); hydrophobic membrane<br>
materials, such as ethylenemethacrylate (EMA) and ethylenevinylacetate (EVA);<br>
bioresorbable polymer systems (International Patent Publication No. WO 98/44964<br>
and US Patent Nos. 5,756,127 and 5,854,388); and other bioresorbable implant<br>
devices composed of, for example, polyesters, polyanhydrides, or lactic acid/glycolic<br>
10<br><br>
acid copolymers (US Patent No. 5,817,343). For use in such sustained delivery<br>
devices, Form II can be formulated as described herein. See, US Patent Nos.<br>
3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; and 4,008,719.<br>

G. Process for Converting Form II Tanaproget Polymorph to Form I<br>
Also provided are processes for preparing tanaproget Form I from tanaproget<br>
polymorph Form II Typically, Form II is converted to Form I via crystallization<br>
from a solvent system or directly from Form II without the use of a solvent.<br>
In one embodiment, Form II is converted to Form I by combining Form II<br>
with acetone and water, desirably a 1:1 ratio of acetone to water. Form II is mixed<br>
with the acetone/water solution for a time that is sufficient to convert Form II to<br>
Form I. Typically, conversion of Form II to Form I occurs as Form II dissolves and<br>
Form I is recrystallized. The conversion can readily be monitored using XRD and<br>
DSC and, specifically, by monitoring the presence of the Form II XRD peaks and<br>
DSC endotherms. Complete conversion is noted by an absence of Form II XRD<br>
peaks and DSC endotherms.<br>
Form I can precipitate from the acetone/water solvent in about 1,2,3,4, 5,6,<br>
or 6 days. Typically, Form I precipitates from the acetone/water solution, after about<br>
1 week, and is collected using techniques known to those of skill in the art.<br>
However, conversion to Form I can be complete in less than 1 week or even less than<br>
1 day depending on the conditions utilized during the conversion and any<br>
environmental factors present at the time of conversion.<br>
14<br><br>
In another embodiment, tanaproget polymorph Form II is converted to<br>
tanaproget Form I without the use of a solvent. Typically, Form II is first heated to<br>
its melting point, typically to about 219 to about 229Â°C5 more desirably about 219 to<br>
about 216Â°C. Heating can be accomplished using a variety of techniques including,<br>
without limitation, hot stage microscopy. Once the Form II has melted, the liquid<br>
sample is typically maintained at about 219Â°C to about 229Â°C to promote<br>
crystallization of the Form I tanaproget polymorph. Form I is then collected using<br>
techniques known to those of skill in the art.<br>
If crystallization to Form I does not occur between 219Â°C and 229Â°C within<br>
an acceptable period of time, the sample is slowly cooled below 219Â°C until<br>
crystallization does occur.<br>
The following examples are provided to illustrate the invention and do not<br>
limit the scope thereof. One skilled in the art will appreciate that although specific<br>
reagents and conditions are outlined in the following examples, modifications can be<br>
made which are meant to be encompassed by the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of Tanaproget Form il Poiymorph from Tanaproget<br>
Form I Using Methylene Chloride/Pentane<br>
Tanaproget Form I polymorph (6.8 g) was dissolved in methylene chloride<br>
(100 rnL) at 29Â°C. After cooling the solution to 20Â°C, pentane (150 mL) was added<br>
dropwise to the solution to give a suspension. The suspension was then filtered and<br>
the filter cake dried to give Tanaproget Form II polymorph (6.1 g).<br>
Example 2 - Preparation of Tanaproget Form II Polymorph from Tanaproget<br>
Form I Using Acetonitrile/Water<br>
Tanaproget Form I polymorph (73.9 mg) was dissolved in acetonitrile (2 mL)<br>
at 55Â°C. Water (about 1 mL) was then added dropwise to the acetonitrile solution.<br>
The suspension was maintained at room temperature overnight and then at 4Â°C for 2<br>
15<br><br>
days. The sample was centrifuged and crystallized Tanaproget Form II polymorph<br>
(about 15 mg) was recovered and air dried.<br>
Example 3 - Preparation of Tanaproget Form I Polymorph from Tanaproget<br>
Form II<br>
Tanaproget polymorph Form H (117.5mg) was weighed into a 4 mL<br>
scintillation vial. Water (1 mL) and acetone (1 mL) were added and the slurry stirred<br>
for 5 days at room temperature. The sample was then centrifuged and the recovered<br>
solid was dried under vacuum for 2 days at room temperature to give Tanaproget<br>
Polymorph Form I. XRD and DSC analysis indicated a complete conversion to Form<br>
I.<br>
Example 4 - Preparation of Tanaproget Form II Polymorph from Tanaproget<br>
Form I Using Methanol/Water<br>
Tanaproget Form I polymorph is dissolved in methanol. Water is then added<br>
dropwise to the methanol solution. The suspension is maintained at room<br>
temperature overnight and then at reduced temperatures 4Â°C for 2 days. The sample<br>
is centrifuged and crystallized Tanaproget Form II polymorph is recovered and air<br>
dried.<br>
Example 5 - Preparation of Tanaproget Form II Polymorph from Tanaproget<br>
Form I Using Heat<br>
A sample of the Form II tanaproget polymorph is heated to a temperature of<br>
about 219Â°C and about 229Â°C heat until the entire sample is melted. Once a liquid<br>
forms, the temperature is maintained between about 219Â°C and about 229Â°C and<br>
crystallization to Form I tanaproget polymorph occurs. The sample is optionally<br>
cooled to below 219 Â°C to further crystallize the Form I tanaproget polymorph.<br>
