				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a particulate textile treatment auxiliary composition that is capable of imparting a fabric-softness benefit to a textile. The composition comprises anionic surfactant, clay and silicone. The composition is particularly suitable as an auxiliary in the laundering of fabrics.<br>
The present invention also relates to a process for preparing a composition for the laundering and treatment of fabric. The composition is typically a laundry detergent composition.<br>
Background<br>
Laundry detergent compositions that both clean and soften fabric during a laundering process are known and have been developed and sold by laundry detergent manufacturers for many years. Typically, these laundry detergent compositions comprise components that are capable of providing a fabric-softening benefit to the laundered fabric; these fabric-softening components include clays and silicones.<br>
The incorporation of clay into laundry detergent compositions to impart a fabric-softening benefit to the laundered fabric is described in the following references. A granular, built laundry detergent composition comprising a smectite clay that is capable of both cleaning and softening a fabric during a laundering process is described in US 4,062,647 (Storm, T. D., and Nirschl, J. P.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company). A heavy duty fabric-softening detergent comprising bentonite clay agglomerates is described in GB 2 138 037 (Allen, E., Coutureau, M, and Dillarstone, A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company). Laundry detergent compositions containing fabric-softening clays of between 150 and 2,000 microns in size are described in US 4,885,101 (Tai, H. T.; Lever Brothers Company).<br>
The fabric-softening performance of clay-containing laundry detergent compositions is improved by the incorporation of a flocculating aid to the clay-containing laundry <br>
detergent composition. For example, a detergent composition comprising a smectite type clay and a polymeric clay-flocculating agent is described in EP 0 299 575 (Racmdonck, H., and Busch, A.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company).<br>
The use of siliconcs to provide a fabric-softening benefit to laundered fabric during a laundering process is also known. US 4,585,563 (Busch, A., and Kosmas, S.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) describes that specific organo-functional polydialkylsiloxanes can advantageously be incorporated in granular detergents to provide remarkable benefits inclusive of through-thc-wash softening and further textile handling improvements. US 5,277,968 (Canivenc, E.; Rhone-Poulenc Chcmie) describes a process for the conditioning of textile substrates to allegedly impart a pleasant feel and good hydrophobiaty thereto, comprising treating such textile substances with an effective conditioning amount of a specific polydiorganosiloxane.<br>
Detergent Manufacturers have attempted to incorporate both clay and silicone in the same laundry detergent composition. For example, siliconates were incorporated in clay-containing compositions to allegedly improve their dispensing performance. US 4, 419, 250 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes agglomerated bentonite particles that comprise a salt of a lower alkyl siliconic acid and/or a polymerization producl(s) thereof. US 4, 421, 657 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes a paniculate heavy-duty laundering and textile-softening composition comprising bentonite clay and a siliconate. US 4, 482,477 (Allen, E., Dillarstone, R., and Reul, J. A.; Colgate-Palmolive Company) describes a paniculate built synthetic organic detergent composition which includes a dispensing assisting proportion of a siliconate and preferably bentonite as a fabric-softening agent. In another example, EP 0 163 352 (York, D. W.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company) describes the incorporation of silicone into a clay-containing laundry detergent composition in an attempt to control the excessive suds that are generated by the clay-containing laundry detergent composition during the laundering process. EP 0 381 487 (Biggin, I. S., and Cartwright, P. S.; BP Chemicals Limited) describes an aqueous based liquid detergent formulation comprising clay that is pre-treated with a barrier material such as a polysiloxane.<br><br>
Detergent manufacturers have also attempted to incorporate a silicone, clay and a flocculant in a laundry detergent composition. For example, a fabric treatment composition comprising substituted polysiloxanes, softening clay and a clay flocculant is described in WO92/07927 (Martclcur, C. A. A. V. J., and Convents, A. C.; The Procter &amp; Gamble Company).<br>
More recently, fabric care compositions comprising an organophilic clay and functionalised oil are described in US 6,656, 901 B2 (Moorfield, D.. and Whilton, N.; Unilever Home &amp; Personal Care USA division of Conopco, Inc.). WO02/092748 (Instone, T. el al; Unilever PLC) describes a granular composition comprising an intimate blend of a non-ionic surfactant and a water-insoluble liquid, which may a silicone, and a granular carrier material, which may be a clay. WO03/055966 (Cocardo, D. M., el al; Hindustain Lever Limited) describes a fabric care composition comprising a solid carrier, which may be a clay, and an anti-wrinkle agent, which may be a silicone.<br>
However, particles that comprise silicone and clay are very soft and have a poor flowability profile. There is a need to improve the strength of particles that comprise both clay and silicone in order to improve their flowability profile whilst not unduly affecting their fabric-softening performance.<br>
Summary<br>
The present invention overcomes the above mentioned problem by providing a process for preparing a textile treatment auxiliary composition in paniculate form, wherein the auxiliary composition comprises anionic surfactant, clay and silicone, and wherein the process comprises the steps of: (i) contacting the silicone with water and a first anionic surfactant, to form an aqueous silicone mixture in emulsified form; and (ii) contacting the aqueous silicone mixture with the clay, a second anionic surfactant and optionally additional water to form a mixture of clay and silicone; (iii) further mixing the mixture of clay and silicone; and (iv) optionally drying and/or cooling the mixture formed in step (iii).<br>
The composition can be used per sc in the treatment of textiles or can be used as an auxiliary in a laundry detergent or additive product. Accordingly, the textile treatment auxiliary composition is sometimes referred to herein as "the auxiliary composition".<br><br>
Description<br>
Process for preparing the textile treatment auxiliary composition.<br>
The process for preparing the auxiliary composition comprises the steps of: (i) contacting a silicone with water and a first anionic surfactant, to form an aqueous silicone mixture in emulsified form; (ii) contacting the aqueous silicone mixture with a clay, a second anionic surfactant and optionally additional water to form a mixture of clay and silicone; (iii) further mixing the mixture of clay and silicone; and (iv) optionally drying and/or cooling the mixture formed in step (iii) to form an auxiliary composition.<br>
Preferably step (i) is carried out in a mixer suitable for forming aqueous silicone emulsions. Step (i) may be carried out under very low shear conditions for example in a mixer having a very low tip-speed. Step (i) is typically carried out at ambient temperature and pressure, although the silicone may be subjected to a temperature in the range of from 10°C to 50°C, or even up to 60°C. Bubbles may form during step (i). If this bubble formation phenomenon docs occur during step (i), then typically the bubbles arc removed by the application of a vacuum. The silicone and first surfactant are typically dosed into step (i) simultaneously, typically the first surfactant is pre-mixed with the water and is in the form of an aqueous paste when it is dosed into step (i).<br>
Preferably step (ii) is carried out in a mixer having a tip speed in the range of from 10ms-1 to 50ms-1, preferably from 25ms-1 (o 40ms-1. Suitable mixers for carrying out step (ii) include high-speed mixers such as CB Loedige     mixers, Schugi     mixers, Littleford™ mixers, Drais™ mixers and lab scale mixers such as Braun™ mixers. Other suitable high-speed mixers arc EirichTM mixers. Preferred high-sheer mixers include pin mixers such as a CB Loedige™ mixer, a LittletordTM mixer or a Drais1 M mixer. Preferably step (iii) is carried out in a mixer having a tip speed of from 1 ms-1to less than IOms-1, preferably from 4ms-1 to 7ms-1. Suitable mixers for carrying out step (iii) include ploughshcar mixers such as a Locdigc KMIM. Preferably the tip speed ratio of the step (ii) mixer to the step (iii) mixer is in the range of from 2:1 to 15:1, preferably from 5:1 to 10:1. Without wishing to be bound by theory, these preferred mixer lip speeds and ratios are believed to ensure optimal process conditions to allow rapid initial mixing of the silicone, clay, anionic surfactant and water in step (ii) to ensure good homogeneity of the<br><br>
mixture and resultant composition, whilst also allowing a more controlled mixing step of the components of the auxiliary composition to occur in step (iii) to prevent over-mixing, such as over-agglomeration of the composition.<br>
Preferably step (iv) is carried out in a fluid bed, such as a fluid bed dryer and/or a fluid bed cooler. The drying stage of step (iv) is typically achieved by subjecting the mixture to hot air, typically having a temperature of greater than 50°C or even greater than 100°C. However, it may be preferred for step (iv) to be carried out at a lower temperature, such as an air inlet temperature in the range of from 10°C to 50°C. The drying stage of step (iv) may also be achieved by subjecting the mixture to dry air, such as conditioned air. The drying stage of step (iv) is typically carried out in a fluid bed dryer. Step (iv) preferably comprises a cooling stage. During this cooling stage, the mixture is preferably subjected to cold air having a temperature of less than 15°C, preferably from 1°C to 15°C, or from 1()°C to 15°C. This cooling stage is preferably carried out in a fluid bed cooler.<br>
Preferably the total amount of solid material that is dosed into step (ii), such as clay and any part of the anionic surfactant, if any, that is dosed in solid form, and the total amount of liquid material that is dosed into step (ii), such as water, silicone and any part of the anionic surfactant, if any, that dosed in liquid form, is controlled such that the weight ratio of the total amount of solid material to the total amount of liquid material that is dosed into step (ii) is in the range of from 2:1 to 10:1, preferably from 3:1 to 6:1. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these levels and ratios of solid materials and liquid materials ensure optimal mixing to prevent over-mixing, such as over-agglomeration from occurring, and ensures that the resultant auxiliary composition has a good hardness and a good flowability profile.<br>
Preferably additional water is dosed into step (ii) and contacted with the aqueous silicone mixture, clay and the second anionic surfactant. By additional water is meant water in addition to (i.e. as well as) the water that is present in the aqueous silicone mixture (i.e. in addition to the water that is dosed in step (i)). Preferably part of the additional water that is dosed in step (ii) is in the form of an intimate mixture with the clay, this means that the part of the additional water is pre-mixed with the clay before it is dosed in step (ii): for example, the clay may be in the form of wet clay particles that also comprise water. Also, it is preferred that part of the additional water is dosed in step (ii)<br><br>
separately From the clay, (his means that part of the additional water is not pre-mixed with the clay before it is dosed in step (ii). Most preferably part of the water dosed in step (ii) is dosed separately from any other component that is also being dosed in step (ii); in this manner preferably part of the additional water has its own individual dosing feed stream into step (ii). Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that this preferred method of dosing any additional water ensures optimal control of the mixing of the composition and ensures that the composition is not over-mixed, such as over-agglomerated, and also ensures that the clay and resultant auxiliary composition have a good fabric-softening performance.<br>
Preferably, the first anionic surfactant has a temperature in the range of from 10°C to 50°C, preferably from 20°C to 40°C, when it is dosed into step (i). More preferably, step (i) is carried out at an operating temperature in (he range of from 10°C to 50°C, preferably from 20°C to 40°C. Preferably, the second anionic surfactant has a temperature in the range of from 10°C to 50°C, preferably from 20°C to 40°C, when it is dosed into step (ii). More preferably, step (ii) is carried out at an operating temperature in the range of from 10°C to 50°C, preferably from 20°C to 40"C. Preferably, the ratio of the dosing temperature of the first anionic surfactant to the dosing temperature of the second anionic surfactant is in the range of from 0.1:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 0.2:1 to 5:1 and most preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1, the dosing temperatures being measured in °C. Preferably the ratio of the operating temperature at which step (i) is carried out to the temperature at which step (ii) is carried out is in the range of from 0.1:1 to 10:1, more preferably from 0.2:1 to 5:1 and most preferably from 0.5:1 to 2:1, the operating temperatures being measured in °C. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that these preferred anionic surfactant dosing temperatures and operating temperatures of steps (i) and (ii) ensure that aqueous siliconc mixture and the resultant auxiliary composition have a good distribution of anionic surfactant, and ensure that the auxiliary composition is not over-mixed, such as over-agglomerated.<br>
Optionally, fine particles such as zeolite and/or additional clay particles, typically having an average particle size in the range of from 1 micrometer to 40 micrometers or even from 1 micrometer to 10 micrometers are dosed in step (iii). Without wishing to be<br><br>
bound by theory, it is believed that this dusting step improves the flowability of the auxiliary composition by reducing its stickiness and controlling its particle growth.<br>
Preferably, step (i) is carried out in an in-line static mixer or an in-line dynamic (shear) mixer, this is especially preferred for continuous processes. Alternatively, step (i) is preferably carried out in a batch mixer such as a Z-blade mixer, anchor mixer or a paddle mixer, this is especially preferred for batch processes.<br>
Step (i) is preferably carried out at an operating temperature in the range of from 10°C to 50°C, preferably from 20°C to 30°C, most preferably at ambient temperature. Preferably, the temperature of the silicone is in the range of from 10°C to 50°C throughout the duration of steps (i), (ii) and (iii); and possibly even also for the duration of step (iv); and possibly even for the duration of the entire process of preparing the composition.<br>
In step (i), the silicone is contacted with a first anionic surfactant and water to form an aqueous silicone mixture. The aqueous silicone mixture is in emulsified form. Preferably, the aqueous silicone mixture is in the form of an oil-in-water emulsion where the silicone forms the internal discontinous phase of the emulsion and the water forms the external continuous phase of the emulsion. Alternatively, the aqueous silicone mixture can be in the form of an water-in-oil emulsion where the water forms the internal discontinous phase of the emulsion and the silicone forms the external continuous phase of the emulsion.<br>
Preferably, the first anionic surfactant is pre-mixed with the water before it is contacted with the silicone in step (i), typically, the first anionic surfactant is in the form of a an aqueous paste, typically having an anionic surfactant activity level in the range of from 25% to 55%, by weight of the paslc.<br>
Typically, the process comprises a si/,e screening step, wherein particles having a particle size of greater than 1,400 micrometers arc removed from the process and optionally recycled back to an earlier step in the process. Typically, these large particles arc removed from the process by sieving. This size screening step typically occurs between steps (iii) and (iv) and/or after step (iv). These large particles are typically recycled back to an earlier step in the process, preferably step (ii) and/or (iii), and optionally these large particles are subjected to a grinding step before they are dosed back into an earlier process step.<br><br>
The process also preferably comprises a second si/,e screening step, wherein particles having a particle size of less than 250 micrometers arc removed from the process and are typically recycled back to an earlier process step, preferably to steps (ii) and/or (iii). These small particles arc removed from the process by sieving and/or clutriation. If elutriation is used, then preferably the second size screening step is carried out in a fluid bed such as the fluid bed dryer and/or cooler, for example such as a fluid bed that is typically used in step (iv) of the process.<br>
Process for preparing a textile treatment, composition for the laundering of fabric.<br>
A textile treatment composition for the laundering of fabric can be prepared by contacting the auxiliary composition with a third anionic surfactant and optionally adjunct components. The third anionic surfactant is preferably in paniculate form, typically being in the form of a spray-dried powder, an agglomerate, an extrudate, a noodle, a needle, a flake, or any combination thereof. The third anionic surfactant may be present in a particle that additionally comprises one or more adjunct components such as builder. Alternatively, the third anionic surfactant may be in the form of a liquid or a colloid/suspension.<br>
The step of contacting the auxiliary composition with a third anionic surfactant can occur in any suitable vessel, such as a mixer or a conveyor belt. The process may also comprise the step of subjecting the textile treatment composition to a tabletting step, and/or at least partially, preferably completely, enclosing the textile treatment composition in a water-soluble film such as a film that comprises polyvinyl alcohol, so that the textile treatment composition is in the form of a tablet and/or a pouch.<br>
Preferably, the auxiliary composition is contacted with additional clay. The additional clay is clay that is present in the textile treatment composition in addition to the clay that is present in the auxiliary composition. The additional clay may be same type or a different of clay from the clay present in the auxiliary composition. Preferably, the weight ratio of the amount of clay that is dosed into step (ii) during the process for preparing the auxiliary composition to the amount of additional clay that is contacted with the auxiliary composition is in the range of from 0.1:1 to 10:1. Without wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that having clay processed in this manner, so that it is<br><br>
typically present in at least two separate particles within the textile treatment composition, enables the textile  treatment composition to have an optimal fabric-softening performance and a good flowability profile.<br>

A preferred hectorite clay is that supplied by Rheox under the tradename Bentone HC. Other preferred hectorite clays for use herein are those hectorite clays supplied by CSM Materials under the tradename Hectorite U and Hectorile R, respectively.<br>
The clay may also be selected from the group consisting of: allophane clays; chlorite clays, preferred chlorite clays are amesile clays, baileychlore clays, chamosile clays, clinochlore clays, cookeite clays, corundophite clays, daphnite clays, delessite clays, gonyerite clays, nimite clays, odinile clays, orthochamosite clays, pannanlile clays, penninite clays, rhipidolite clays, sudoite clays and thuringite clays; illite clays; inter-stratified clays; iron oxyhydroxidc clays, preferred iron oxyhydoxidc clays arc hematite clays, goethite clays, lepidocrite clays and ferrihydritc clays; kaolin clays, preferred kaolin clays are kaolinite clays, halloysite clays, dickite clays, nacrite clays and hisingerite clays; smectite clays; vermiculile clays; and mixtures thereof.<br>

Preferred light coloured crystalline clay minerals are china clays, halloysite clays, dioctahedral clays such as kaolinite, trioctahedral clays such as antigorite and amesite, smectite and hormitc clays such as bcntonitc (montmorillonitc), bcidilitc, nontronitc, hectorite, attapulgite, pimelitc, mica, muscovite and vermiculite clays, as well as pyrophyllitc/talc, willcmscitc and minncsolaitc clays. Preferred light coloured crystalline clay minerals are described in GB2357523A and WOO 1/44425.<br>
Preferred clays have a cationic exchange capacity of at least 70mcq/100g. The cationic exchange capacity of clays can be measured using the method described in Grimshaw, The Chemistry and Physics of Clays, Interscience Publishers, Inc., pp. 264-265 (1971).<br><br>
Preferably, the clay has a weight average primary particle size, typically of greater than 20 micrometers, preferably more than 23 micrometers, preferably more than 25 micrometers, or preferably from 21 micrometers to 60 micrometers, more preferably from 22 micrometers to 50 micrometers, more preferably from 23 micrometers to 40 micrometers, more preferably from 24 micrometers to 30 micrometers, more preferably from 25 micrometers to 28 micrometers. Clays having these preferred weight average primary particle sizes provide a further improved fabric-softening benefit. The method for determining the weight average particle size of the clay is described in more detail hereinafter.<br>
Method For Determining The Weight Average Primary Particle Size Of The Clay:<br>
The weight average primary particle size of the clay is typically determined using the following method: 12g clay is placed in a glass beaker containing 250ml distilled water and vigorously stirred for 5 minutes to form a clay suspension. The clay is not sonicated, or microfluidisccl in a high pressure microfluidizcr processor, but is added to said beaker of water in an unprocessed form (i.e. in its raw form). 1ml clay suspension is added to the reservoir volume of an Accusizer 780 single-panicle optical sizer (SPOS) using a micropipelte. The clay suspension lhal is added to the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS is diluted in more distilled water to form a diluted clay suspension; this dilution occurs in the reservoir volume of said Accusizer 780 SPOS and is an automated process that is controlled by said Accusizer 780 SPOS, which determines the optimum concentration of said diluted clay suspension for determining the weight average particle size of the clay particles in the diluted clay suspension.
