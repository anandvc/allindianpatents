The  invention  relates  to a precision  slipring  used  for tracking radars and instruments and a method of making the same.<br>
Sliprings are used in radars for quite some time. Various types of sliprings are known in the art. Sliprings which can be operated with high frequency video circuits are required for modern radars. In instruments and radars used with rockets precision sliprings are required for data transfer. The sliprings are stacked and the lead connections are brought outside the housing. Existing sliprings are embeded in glass epoxy providing insulation between the concentric rings and between two layers of concentric rings. The following disadvantages were experienced in the existing sliprings.<br>
The glass epoxy insulator is hygroscopic and hence soaks in water. This brings down the insulation of the sliprings to below 20 Megohm instead of the specified 1000 Hegaohm insulation between rings, when 500 volt DC is charged between them. Due to the absorption of moisture in the disc all the six circuits provided in each disc gets shorted, and not more than 92 circuits can be energised at a time. The brush contact provided on the tip  of the contact arm is of a low silver graphite  alloy.   The<br><br>
brush is made of a material in which the silver content is not more than 80 %, and the balance is graphite. The problem encountered is that the graphite powder eroded from the brush makes a tail on the surface of the disc and it act as another connection between two circuits and gets shorted. The brush wear is more in the slipring unit and the tip end of brush gets worn-out easily and there by shorting it with adjacent power line causing damage.<br>
In an attempt to overcome these disadvantages a precision slipring was developed. The invention provides a slipring with a capacity to transfer electrical signal from millivolts to 440 volts at a frequency range of 50Hs to 50 MHs. The temperature rise is less than 15oC above ambient during operation. They could be used with shafts ranging from 75 mm to 450 mm and as many as 250 circuits could be used. The epoxy compound used for embeding the conductor rings is non hygroscopic and hence provides improved water resistance. The sliprings made according to the invention can be made in wide range of sizes and the modular structure makes replacement easy. The loss of material during fabrication is minimum and the encapsulation procedure is fast and easy. The sliprings made according to the invention may be used in wide range of applications in various type of instruments.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a precision siipring used for tracking radars and instruments said slipring comprising plurality of co-planner concentric conductor rings supported by an inner support member and embeded in at least one side of an insulator disc made* of moulded epoxy resin with only part of thickness of the conductor rings being covered by the epoxy resin, two movable electrical contacts from opposite sides of each conductor ring and lead wires being taken from each conductor   rings   and  each movable  contacts   for   external<br>
connection.<br>
»<br>
The invention also provides a method of making a precision siipring as described hereinabove, comprising the steps of : making plurality of concentric conductors with lead connections; setting these concentric conductors in a mould with each set of concentric conductors in a single plane using re-inforcing spacers; preparing an epoxy resin with good flowability; encapsulating the plurality of conductors by pouring the epoxy resin in the mould; allowing the epoxy resin to cure; releasing the encapsulated conductors from the mould, removing the epoxy resin from the top surface of the conductor rings and fixing the movable contacts on the concentric conductor rings embeded in the epoxy resin.<br><br>
Preferably two co-planar concentric conductor rings are embeded on both sides of the insulating disc made of moulded epoxy resin. The epoxy resin used provides nonhygroscopic insulation of more than 1000 Megohm between the rings. The resin used for moulding is a modified epoxy polymer resin suitable for insulation embedment applications. The resin used has low viscosity with good flowability.<br>
The conductors are pretreated by cleaning contact points and soldered contact joints by a suitable solvent and dried. Then the contact joints are coated with a formulated resin to provide adequate covering and cured. The conductors are then cleaned by a degreasing solvents and then dried. The conductors are pretreated by contacting with a FeCl3 solution of desired concentration for 2 minutes and then washed under distilled water and dried.<br>
The mould is prepared by applying a release agent based on wax inside the mould and the conductors are fixed inside the mould with reinforcing spacers.<br><br>
A modified epoxy polymer resin system is used  for potting<br>
4<br>
the conductor rings which is prepared by mixing ingredients of a liquid aromatic epoxy resin, an amine catalyst, a polysulphide resin and a liquid aldehyde namely furfural acting as reactive diluents in fixed ratios and carefully reacting the system in a suitable container for a known duration of time to maintain flowability under controlled conditions of pressure and temperature.<br>
A glass beaker of 2 litres capacity is taken and 350 to 450 gms of an epoxy resin diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A is taken and then mixed with 80 to 122 gms of Polysulfide resin followed by addition . of 15 to 30 gms of the liquid aldehyde namely furfural. This mixture is thoroughly mixed with a glass rod. To this mixture 12 to 25 gms of an amine catalyst is added and mixed thoroughly again. This is then allowed to stand for 2 to 3 minutes. The mixture is then degassed under vacuum till no foaming and no appreciable quantity of bubbles are seen, This reacting liquid resin is pumped into the mould kept under vacuum and by adopting suitable gravity flow methods and techniques to obtain void free encapsulation and casting. This is allowed to cure for 12 to 24 hours duration at room temperature. The conductor rings are thus embedded in the potting resin.<br>
The encapsulated concentric rings is demoulded, cleaned free of release agent and finished by machining to the required finish and accuracy.<br><br>
