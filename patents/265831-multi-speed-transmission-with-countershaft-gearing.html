MULTI-SPEED TRANSMISSION WITH<br>
COUNTERSHAFT GEARING<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having a<br>
countershaft gearing arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002]	A typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a combination<br>
of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve "power-<br>
on" or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the other,<br>
with the synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to<br>
actually making the dynamic shift. "Power-on" shifting means that torque flow<br>
from the engine need not be interrupted prior to making the shift. This concept<br>
typically uses countershaft gears with a different, dedicated gear pair or set to<br>
achieve each forward speed ratio. Accordingly, the total number of gears required<br>
in this typical design is two times the number of forward speeds, plus three for<br>
reverse. This necessitates a large number of required gear pairs, especially in<br>
transmissions that have a relatively large number of forward speed ratios.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003]	In an aspect of the present invention a powertrain having a<br>
transmission input member, a power source for generating a torque in the input<br>
member, a first intermediate shaft, a second intermediate shaft concentric with the<br>
first intermediate shaft, a clutch, first and second countershafts, a first and second<br>
set of gears, an output shaft and a first transfer gear is provided. The clutch is<br>
selectively engagable to couple the transmission input member with one of the first<br>
and second intermediate shafts. The first set of gears are connected for common<br><br>
2<br>
P000052<br>
rotation with the first intermediate shaft and intermesh with a first selectable set of<br>

the first selectable set of gears is connectable for common rotation with one of the<br>
first and second countershafts for selectively transferring the torque to the<br>
countershafts when the clutch is engaged. The second set of gears is connected for<br>
common rotation with the second intermediate shaft and intermesh with a second<br>
selectable set of gears to form a second plurality of co-planar gear sets, wherein<br>
each of the gears of the second selectable set of gears is connectable for common<br>
rotation with one of the first and second countershafts for selectively transferring<br>
the torque to one of the countershafts when the clutch is engaged. The output shaft<br>
is disposed radially outward of the second intermediate shaft. The first transfer<br>
gear is coupled to one of the first and second countershafts for transferring torque<br>
from the countershaft to the output shaft.<br>

referred to as such. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the input and output<br>
members 12, 14 may be components other than shafts. The input shaft 12 is<br>
continuously connected with a torque converter 16 or other starting device. An<br>
engine (not shown) is connected to and provides a driving torque to the torque<br><br>

P000052<br>
[0037]	The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input<br>
shaft 12 to the output shaft 14 in at least seven forward torque ratios and one reverse<br>
torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio is<br>
attained by engagement of dual clutch 30 and one of the clutch elements 34, 36 and<br>
one or more of the synchronizers 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122 and 124. Those<br>
skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with<br>
each torque ratio.<br>
[0038]	To establish the reverse torque ratio clutch element 36 of the dual<br>
clutch 30 and synchronizer 110 are engaged. By the engagement of clutch element<br>
36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from the input shaft 12 through clutch<br>
housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24. Further, torque is transferred from<br>
the second intermediate shaft 24 through gear 62 to idler gear 64. Idler gear 64<br>

of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 82. Gear 82 transfers the<br>

to countershaft 26. Countershaft 26 transfers the torque to gear 42. Gear 42<br>
transfers torque to gear 44, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14.<br>
Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0042]	The next subsequent forward torque ratio (4th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 112. By the<br>

transfers torque to gear 54, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14.<br>

[0044]	A subsequent forward torque ratio (6th gear) is established by<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 116. By the<br>
engagement of clutch element 36 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from<br>
input shaft 12 through clutch housing 32 to the second intermediate shaft 24.<br>

52. Gear 52 transfers torque to gear 54, which in turn transfers the torque to output<br>
shaft 14. Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0045]	The subsequent torque ratio (7th gear) is established by engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30 and synchronizer 124. By the engagement<br>
of clutch element 34 of the dual clutch 30, torque is transferred from input shaft 12<br>
through clutch housing 32 to the first intermediate shaft 22. Further, torque is<br>
transferred from the first intermediate shaft 22 to gear 102. Gear 102 transfers the<br>
torque to gear 104. Upon engagement of synchronizer 124, gear 104 transfers<br>
torque to countershaft 28. Countershaft 28 transfers the torque to gear 52. Gear 52<br>
transfers torque to gear 54, which in turn transfers the torque to output shaft 14.<br>
Output shaft 14 transfers the torque to the final drive unit 18.<br>
[0046]	The present invention contemplates that a variety of torque ratios<br>
(i.e., the ratio of torque of the output member 14 to the input member 12) are<br>
achievable through the selection of tooth counts of the gears of the transmission 10.<br>
Moreover, the present invention advantageously provides the transfer gears 42, 44 in<br>
one plane and transfer gears 52, 54 in another plane. This arrangement provides the<br>
opportunity to achieve the desired gear ratios. Further, flexibility is provided in the<br>
selection of gear ratios with respect to 1st gear and 7th gear, as the gears (92, 94, 102<br>
and 104) that provide these ratios are disposed in two separate planes. Moreover, a<br>
single pinion gear 92 is used to provide the 1st gear and a separate single pinion<br><br>
11<br>
P000052<br>
gear 102 is used to provide the 7th gear. An overall transmission length reduction<br>
is achieved using the single plane idler gear 64, which establishes a reverse gear<br>
ratio.<br>
