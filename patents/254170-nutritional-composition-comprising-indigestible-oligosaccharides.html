FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a method for the prevention and/or treatment of<br>
respiratory tract infections, said method comprising the administration of indigestible<br>
oligosaccharides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The respiratory tract is a common site for infection by pathogens. It becomes infected<br>
frequently because it is in direct contact with the physical environment and is exposed<br>
to microorganisms in the air, There are several microorganisms that cause illness in<br>
infants,<br>
Respiratory syncytial was (RSV) is the leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract<br>
disease in infants and children. Primary RSV infection occws most often in children<br>
from 6 weeks to 2 years of age. RSV is estimated to cause as much as 75% of all<br>
childhood brortchiolitis and up to 40% of all pediarric pneumonias. Children at<br>
increased risk from RSV infection include proterm. infants and children with<br>
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart disease, congenital or acquired<br>
immunodeficiency and cystic fibrosis The fatality rate in infants with heart or lung<br>
disease who are hospitalized with RSV infection is 3%-4%. Treatment options for<br>
established RSV disease are limited. Severe RSV disease of the lower respiratory tract<br>
often requires considerable supportive .-are, including administration of humidified<br>
oxygen and respiratory assistance.<br>
Parainfluenza viral infection results in serious respiratory tract disease in infants and<br>
children. Infectious parainfluenza account for approximately 20% of all<br>
hospitalizations of pediatric patients suffering from respiratory tract infections<br>
worldwide.<br>
Infants breast fed with mothers milk have a reduced occurrence of respiratory tract<br>
infection. In the art, it is presently believed that this reduced occurrence is. because<br>
mothers milk contains imniunoglobulin with virus or other microorganism neutralizing<br>
activity.<br>
Treatment of respiratory infection is often difficult. Only a few effective drugs are<br>
available and often treatment requires pulmonary administration of the drug. In young<br>
infants this leads to significant stress, Therefore there is a need for further effective<br>
agents that preferably can be administered without imposing or decreasing imposing<br>
stress on infants and children.<br>
Recently is has been described that administration, of infant formula enriched with<br>
prebiotics (galactooligosaccharides), probiotics, nucleotides and LC-PUFA and with a<br>
low level of lactose is useful for infants suffering from respiratory infections (Rivero et<br>
al (2004), J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 39:suppl.l, P1121).<br>
In a multicentre clinical trial, the present inventors have now surprisingly found that<br>
enteral administration of a combination of.<br>
a) a galactose containing indigestible oligosaccharide containing at least two terminal<br>
saccharide units, wherein at least one terminal saccharide unit is selected from the<br>
group consisting of glucose and galactose; and at least one terminal saccharide is<br>
selected from the group consisting of galactose and fucose; and<br>
b) a digestible galactose saccharide<br>
results in a reduced occurrence of respiratory tract infections, see example 6.<br>
The present method has the advantage that the active principle is safe and can be<br>
suitably admixed to nutrition. This leads to significantly reduced stress, particularly in<br>
infants. Hence, in one aspect, the present invention comprises the oral administration of<br>
a nutritional composition which reduces the occurrence of respiratory tract infection.<br>
The present invention is particularly surprising because until now, it was believe that a<br>
low lactose content was essential for the prevention of respiratory disorder in infants.<br>
The present inventors found that administering a nutritional composition containing a<br>
transgalactooligosaccharide and rich in lactose is particularly effective preventing or<br>
treating respiratory infection.<br>
The present inventors have found that both the galactose containing indigestible<br>
oligosaccharide and a digestible galactose saccharide are essential for optimal treatment<br>
and/or prevention of respiratory infection and/or respiratory infection disease.<br>
Moreover, particularly lactose contributes to a reduced occurrence of respiratory tract<br>
infection.<br>
Additionally, the present invention is also of significant commercial .importance. The<br>
manufacture of low lactose formula requires for example the use of a non-milk protein<br>
source (e.g. soy protein) or an additional treatment of milk wherein the lactose is<br>
removed (e.g. ultrafiltration). Both options are often undesirable as they increase costs<br>
and may provide sub-optimal nutrition.<br>
» ii-':<br>
la a further aspect the present invention provides a method for the treatment and/or<br>
prevention of respiratory tract infection and respiratory tract infection disease, said<br>
method comprising administering a nutritional composition. Administration of the<br>
present active principle as a nutritional composition aims to reduce stress and more<br>
optimally reduces the occurrence of respiratory infections as said oligosaccharide<br>
works synergistically with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, the combination of<br>
choline and zinc, probiotics and/or prebiotics other than the galactose containing<br>
indigestible oligosaccharide. In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides<br>
a method for the treatment and/or prevention of respiratory syncyticial virus infection,<br>
said method comprising administrating to an infant with the age between 0 and 2,' a<br>
nutritional composition comprising an effective amount of<br>
transgalactooligosaccharides.<br>
In still a further aspect the present invention provides a composition which is<br>
particularly suitable for the treatment and/or prevention of respiratory tract infection<br>
and disease, said composition comprising said oligosaccharide and an immunoglobulin<br>
with virus neutralizing activity, e.g. immunoglobulin with parainfluenza or RSV<br>
neutralizing activity. The immunoglobulin is preferably obtained from a cow hyperimmunised<br>
against respiratory virus.<br>

Example 6: Effectiveness of transgalactooiigsaccnarides in standard infant formula's<br>
for prevention of respiratory tract infections in infants of the age until 1 year.<br>
Method; A muldcentre clinical trial was performed in Italy, including 7 centers and 56<br>
paediatricians. At the moment breast-feeding was stopped, infants were divided into<br>
two groups. The infants in Group A (n=69) were administered Nutrilon™ 1 or 2<br>
supplemented with oligosacchaiides to a final concentration of 0.36 g<br>
transgalactooligosaccharides/100 ml (Vivinal-GOS™; Borculo Domo Ingredients,<br>
Netherlands) and 0.04 g fructopolysaccharide/100 ml (Raftiline HP™, Orafti, Tienen,<br>
Belgium). The infants in control group B (n=82) received standard NutrilonTM I or 2.<br>
Nutrilon 1™ contains 45 en% carbohydrate, 8 en% protein and 47 en% fat; about 97<br>
wt% lactose based on total carbohydrate; 7.3 gram lactose pej 100 ml; about 54 gram<br>

wt% lactose based on total carbohydrate; 7.9 gram lactose per 100 ml; about 54 gram<br>
lactose per 100 gram dry weight of the complete composition.<br>
Results: The age of the infants varied between 2 and 9 months and the infants were<br>
followed for 6 months. Both groups did not show any difference in nutritional intake.<br>
In group A a total number of 32 upper respiratory tract infection episodes was<br>
observed. In control group B a total number of 60 upper respiratory tract infection<br>
episodes was observed. Thus the incidence of upper respiratory infection episodes was<br>
significant (p
