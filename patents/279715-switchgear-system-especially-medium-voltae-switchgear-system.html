Description<br>
Switchgear system, especially medium-voltage switchgear system<br>
The invention relates to a switchgear system, especially a<br>
medium-voltage switchgear system, comprising a plurality of<br>
switching devices, cable connections and/or busbars which are<br>
arranged in a switchgear cabinet, the one or more switching<br>
devices being arranged in a metal-encapsulated gas-insulated<br>
container above a plurality of fuse cassettes containing fuse<br>
elements in the switchgear cabinet.<br>
In energy distribution, especially at the medium-voltage level,<br>
compact gas or air-insulated switchgear systems are used to<br>
fulfill switching and protection tasks in electrical<br>
distribution networks. Particularly in the secondary<br>
distribution sector with relatively low rated currents up to<br>
max. 1250 A and short-circuit currents up to a maximum of<br>
2 5 kA, switchgear systems are designed in a so-called block or<br>
modular form. That is to say that several switching devices<br>
with different switching functions, such as load switches,<br>
circuit breakers and transformer branch circuits for example,<br>
are arranged in a single container which is normally filled<br>
with an insulating gas, e.g. sulfur hexafluoride gas.<br>
Here, several switching devices of several containers are<br>
connected, for example by means of a busbar which is fed out of<br>
the container, to form a larger switchgear system consisting of<br>
several switch panels with different switching functions.<br>
Switch panels with a single switching function are also<br>
connected to one another, for example by means of a busbar<br>
which is fed out of the panel. These switchgear systems are<br>
divided into expandable and non-expandable system types.<br>
Along with the container (also referred to as gas container),<br>
these switchgear systems consist of the described busbar, a<br>
 <br>
cable connection area and, when<br>
 <br>
high-voltage/high-power fuses are used, a fuse compartment with<br>
fuse cassettes in which fuse elements are arranged.<br>
Normally, the described components and sections are arranged<br>
with respect to one another in a special way so that these<br>
switchgear systems are particularly economical to manufacture<br>
and operate.<br>
In this regard, it is known to place the fuse compartment of<br>
the described switchgear system in the cable connection<br>
compartment of the transformer branch-circuit panel and to bolt<br>
the cable connection directly to the cast-resin fuse<br>
receptacle.<br>
Furthermore, a particular design characteristic of a switchgear<br>
system type of the above kind is a designated rupturing point<br>
which is integrated into the outer skin of the gas-insulated<br>
container. This designated rupturing point serves to relieve a<br>
high over-pressure which can occur within the container in the<br>
event of an arcing fault inside the container. An arcing fault<br>
is associated with severe heating of the gas to several 1000Â°C<br>
and therefore a considerable increase in pressure to several<br>
bar within a few tens of milliseconds.<br>
The designated rupturing point is usually designed in the form<br>
of a rupture diaphragm or burst disk, the burst pressure of<br>
which is set to greater than a maximum gas pressure in the<br>
container which occurs in normal operation but less than a<br>
burst pressure of the overall container. The pressure relief<br>
for the whole switchgear system is determined by the<br>
arrangement of the burst disk in a predetermined direction. As<br>
a rule, pressure in the switchgear system is relieved in the<br>
direction of the ground. That is to say, the escaping hot gases<br>
are directed downwards.<br>
 <br>
With a switchgear system having a fuse compartment below the<br>
container in the cable connection compartment, particularly in<br>
the case of expandable switch panels, the problem occurs that<br>
in the event of an arcing fault inside the container, the hot<br>
gases<br>
 <br>
escape into the fuse compartment so that when a fuse<br>
compartment access cover is removed the hot gases escape<br>
forwards and, in particularly unfavorable cases, operating<br>
personnel can be injured.<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a switchgear system,<br>
especially a medium-voltage switchgear system, which is<br>
constructed in such a way that safe access to the fuse<br>
compartment is made possible in the event of a fault.<br>
According to the invention, the object is achieved by the<br>
characteristics stated in claim 1.<br>
Advantageous developments of the invention are the subject<br>
matter of the dependent claims.<br>
According to the invention, a switchgear system, especially a<br>
medium-voltage switchgear system, comprises a plurality of<br>
switching devices, cable connections and/or busbars which are<br>
arranged in a switchgear cabinet, the one or more switching<br>
devices being arranged in a metal-encapsulated container which<br>
is filled with insulating gas above a plurality of fuse<br>
cassettes containing fuse elements in the switchgear cabinet,<br>
the container being provided with at least one pressure relief<br>
device having a predetermined direction of relief, and at least<br>
one bulkhead element being associated with the fuse cassettes<br>
on at least one side facing the direction of relief.<br>
The bulkhead element arranged in the area of the fuse cassette<br>
in the direction of relief of the pressure relief device<br>
prevents an escape of hot gases forwards into a fuse<br>
compartment by specifically diverting the gases into a<br>
discharge channel. This ensures that, in particular even when<br>
the switchgear system is expanded, substantially no gases<br>
escape forwards towards an operator when the switchgear cabinet<br>
 <br>
is opened in the event of a fault, in particular the fuse<br>
compartment<br>
 <br>
containing the fuse cassettes. This provides a high level of<br>
operating safety. The use of simple bulkhead elements results<br>
in a compact and simple as well as cost-effective construction.<br>
A possible embodiment of the invention provides that, with an<br>
arrangement of the pressure relief device in the area of the<br>
rear wall of the container, a rear bulkhead element is<br>
associated with those ends, in particular the rear ends, of the<br>
fuse cassettes which lie in the direction of the area of the<br>
rear wall of the container, and is arranged to conceal or cover<br>
these at least partially or completely. At the same time, in<br>
particular, a bulkhead plate at the rear of the fuse cassettes<br>
is drawn in to provide partial or complete covering so that<br>
escaping gases are deflected downwards past the fuse cassettes.<br>
This reliably prevents gases entering the fuse compartment so<br>
that no gases escape forwards towards an operator when a fuse<br>
element is changed or replaced.<br>
In a further alternative embodiment, when the pressure relief<br>
device is arranged at least in a side wall area of the<br>
container, a lateral bulkhead element is associated with that<br>
side of the fuse cassettes which faces the direction of relief<br>
and is arranged to provide at least partial or complete<br>
covering. The bulkhead element which is arranged on the side of<br>
the fuse cassette(s) enables the escaping gases to be diverted<br>
sideways and downwards and therefore prevents the escaping<br>
gases entering the fuse compartment.<br>
In an alternative arrangement of the pressure relief device at<br>
least in a floor area of the container, a front bulkhead<br>
element is preferably associated with a front wall area of the<br>
container and/or cabinet front area and the fuse cassettes and<br>
is arranged to provide at least partial or complete covering of<br>
this front wall area and/or cabinet front area. In doing so, a<br>
 <br>
front bulkhead element of this kind provides a pressure-tight<br>
seal for the fuse cassettes against the outside of the<br>
switchgear system, thus reliably preventing the gases from<br>
escaping forwards.<br>
In a further alternative embodiment of the invention, when the<br>
pressure relief device is arranged in the front wall area of<br>
the container, the or a further front bulkhead element is<br>
associated with those ends (front ends) of the fuse cassettes<br>
which lie in the direction of the front wall area of the<br>
container and is arranged to provide at least partial covering<br>
for these and the front wall area of the container. In doing<br>
so, the bulkhead element(s) is/are arranged in the front area,<br>
in particular the cabinet front area of the switchgear system,<br>
to provide partial or complete covering for the front wall area<br>
of the container and/or the fuse cassettes. Front bulkhead<br>
elements of this kind therefore provide a pressure-tight seal<br>
for the fuse cassettes against the outside of the switchgear<br>
system, thus reliably preventing the gases from escaping<br>
forwards.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, the specific bulkhead element is<br>
designed in particular to be pressure-tight in such a way that<br>
it forms a discharge in the direction of relief. The respective<br>
bulkhead element is suitably shaped for this purpose. For<br>
example, the bulkhead element is designed in the form of a<br>
bulkhead sheet, a bulkhead plate and/or a bulkhead section.<br>
Also, a plurality of bulkhead elements can be provided which<br>
are arranged in such a way that they form a channel through<br>
which escaping gases are reliably diverted downwards.<br>
In addition, the channel can be provided with at least one<br>
associated control element, in particular a valve flap. In<br>
doing so, the channel is closed by means of the control element<br>
in such a way that a penetration of such gases as are produced,<br>
for example, by an arc in an adjacent part of the system, is<br>
 <br>
prevented. This ensures that gases escaping from adjacent parts<br>
of the system do not enter the area of the fuse cassettes and<br>
therefore<br>
 <br>
the fuse compartment, and do not permanently damage these, in<br>
particular the fuse elements.<br>
A simple embodiment provides that the bulkhead element is made<br>
of metal, in particular sheet steel. Alternatively, the<br>
bulkhead element can be made of plastic, in particular<br>
Duroplast or Thermoplast, or another suitable, in particular<br>
fiber-reinforced, plastic.<br>
In addition, the bulkhead element can be designed in the form<br>
of a multi-part element which, for example, at least partially<br>
or completely encloses the fuse cassettes and/or which forms a<br>
channel for discharging gases escaping from the container.<br>
Further, the fuse cassettes can be provided with at least one<br>
receiving element, in particular a slot, in which the bulkhead<br>
element is arranged. This enables a simple or freely accessible<br>
assembly or disassembly of the bulkhead element.<br>
In addition, at least one guide element can be arranged in the<br>
area of the direction of relief, in particular before the<br>
pressure relief device. In doing so, the guide element is<br>
designed in such a way that it forms a discharge and/or<br>
diversion in the direction of relief for escaping gases. This<br>
ensures that escaping gases are diverted downwards and/or<br>
backwards and downwards so that no gases can escape forwards<br>
when operating the switchgear system.<br>
Expediently, the guide element is designed as a section. For<br>
example, the guide element can be designed in the form of a U-<br>
section, an L-section or a hollow channel section. A plurality<br>
of guide elements can also be provided which are arranged in<br>
such a way that they form a guide channel. To close or open the<br>
guide channel in the event of a fault in an adjacent part of<br>
the system or in the event of a fault in the associated part of<br>
the system, in particular the associated<br>
 <br>
switching device,<br>
 <br>
the guide channel is provided with at least one associated<br>
control element, in particular an adjustable valve flap.<br>
A simple embodiment provides that the guide element is made of<br>
metal, in particular sheet steel. Alternatively, the guide<br>
element can be made of plastic, in particular Duroplast or<br>
Thermoplast, or another suitable, in particular fiber-<br>
reinforced, plastic.<br>

Corresponding parts are given the same references in all the<br>
figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows in front view a modular switchgear system 1 with<br>
a switchgear cabinet 2 comprising a switch panel 4 for at least<br>
one switching device, a fuse compartment 6 arranged thereunder<br>
and a cable connection compartment 8 according to the prior<br>
art.<br>
The switchgear system 1 is, in particular, a metal-<br>
encapsulated, gas-insulated medium-voltage switchgear system,<br>
wherein a system-oriented number of switching devices which are<br>
not shown in more detail such as load isolating switches for<br>
example, are arranged in the switch panel 4 in a metal-<br>
encapsulated, gas-insulated container 10.<br>
The fuse compartment 6 is accessible by means of a releasable<br>
fuse cover 12, so that the fuse compartment 6 and if necessary<br>
 <br>
the adjacent area can be accessed in the event of a fault by-<br>
opening the fuse cover 12.<br>
 <br>
The cable connection compartment 8 is fitted with a cable<br>
connection faceplate 14.<br>
Figure 2 shows schematically in front view a switchgear cabinet<br>
2 with open fuse cover 12 for the fuse compartment 6.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of Figure 2, the switchgear system<br>
1 comprises three fuse elements 16 which, in the event of a<br>
disturbance or fault, e.g. in the event of a short circuit or<br>
overload, switch at least one or more of the switching devices<br>
by means of a fuse tripping mechanism 18 so that a load<br>
connected to a network by the switching device is isolated. At<br>
the same time, the switchgear system 1 can have one or more<br>
fuse elements 16 per switching device. The fuse elements 16 are<br>
in each case arranged in an associated fuse cassette 20 (also<br>
referred to as fuse chamber).<br>
In" order t
the case of an arcing fault in the container 10, by<br>
specifically directed escape of gases and to specifically route<br>
or deflect the escaping gases, a plurality of bulkhead elements<br>
22.1 to 22.n associated with the fuse cassettes 20 is arranged<br>
in the switchgear cabinet 2 on at least one side facing the<br>
direction of relief of the gas.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment according to Figure 2, two front<br>
bulkhead elements 22.1, 22.2 are provided which are arranged as<br>
separate flat bulkhead plates or bulkhead walls above and below<br>
the fuse compartment 6 to cover it at the front so that, in the<br>
event of gas escaping downwards from the container 10, a gas<br>
escape forwards is prevented by the front bulkhead elements<br>
22.1, 22.2 by the gas being able to be diverted downwards. At<br>
the same time, the front bulkhead elements 22.1, 22.2 can be<br>
provided in the switchgear cabinet 2 irrespective of the<br>
position of a pressure relief device 24 arranged on the<br>
 <br>
container 10, the different positions of which are described in<br>
more detail in the following figures.<br>
 <br>
Figure 3 shows a further exemplary embodiment for the invention<br>
in which a pressure relief device 24 is arranged in the rear<br>
wall area 26, in particular in a rear floor area 28 of the<br>
container 10.<br>
The pressure relief device 24 is a conventional device, e.g. a<br>
so-called rupture diaphragm or a burst disk with a defined<br>
designated rupturing point which is set, for example, greater<br>
than a maximum gas pressure which occurs in the container 10 in<br>
normal operation and less than a burst pressure for the<br>
container 10. At the same time, the pressure relief device 24<br>
is designed in such a way that it has a predetermined direction<br>
of relief R in which the escaping gas escapes when the pressure<br>
relief device 24 bursts.<br>
A rear bulkhead element 22.3 in the fuse compartment 6 is<br>
associated with the fuse cassettes 20 for specifically<br>
diverting gas which escapes in the event of a fault. At the<br>
same time, the bulkhead element 22.3 has a section shape which<br>
corresponds with the rear outside shape of the fuse cassette(s)<br>
20 so that the fuse cassette(s) 20 is/are substantially<br>
completely covered by the rear bulkhead element 22.3 so that<br>
gas escaping from the container 10 cannot penetrate the fuse<br>
compartment 6 in a forwards direction.<br>
The rear bulkhead element 22.3 is in	particular designed as a<br>
bent plate, in particular a bent	steel sheet, or as an<br>
appropriately formed plastic plate,	for example made from<br>
Thermoplast or Duroplast.<br>
The switching device (s) arranged in the container 10 can be<br>
connected via bushing assemblies 30, which emerge from the<br>
container 10, the fuse element 16 and a cable connection 32,<br>
for example, to a busbar connection in the cable connection<br>
compartment 8 which is not shown in more detail. At the same<br>
time, both the bushing assemblies 30<br>
 <br>
and the cable connection 32 are appropriately insulated in a<br>
conventional manner.<br>
Figure 4 shows schematically in front view a switchgear cabinet<br>
1 with open fuse cover 12 for the fuse compartment 6 and with a<br>
lateral bulkhead element 22.4 for the fuse compartment 6. In<br>
this exemplary embodiment, the pressure relief device 24 is<br>
arranged at the side of the fuse compartment 6. For example,<br>
the pressure relief device 24 is arranged in a front wall area<br>
34 of the container 10 in the forward-facing floor area 28. In<br>
order to laterally seal off the fuse compartment 6, the lateral<br>
bulkhead element 22.4 is associated with that side of the fuse<br>
cassettes 20 which faces the direction of relief R. At the same<br>
time, the lateral bulkhead element 22.4 completely covers the<br>
side of the fuse cassettes 2 0 so that the escaping gases are<br>
diverted downwards and no gases escaping in the direction of<br>
relief R find their way into the fuse compartment 6. At the<br>
same time, the lateral bulkhead element 22.4 is designed in the<br>
form of an appropriately shaped or bent plate, in particular a<br>
steel plate or plastic plate.<br>
Expediently, the ends of the lateral bulkhead element 22.4<br>
pointing towards the container 10 are bent in such a way that<br>
they run parallel to the floor area 2 8 of the container 10 and<br>
are fixed thereto by friction, interlocking and/or bonding. The<br>
opposite ends of the lateral bulkhead element 22.4 are fixed by<br>
interlocking, friction and/or bonding, for example, to a side<br>
wall 3 6 of the cable connection compartment 8. The lateral<br>
bulkhead element 22.4 can also be fixed in some other suitable<br>
manner to some other suitable point in the switchgear cabinet<br>
2.<br>
Figure 5 shows in longitudinal section a switchgear cabinet 2 with a<br>
further front bulkhead element 22.5 in the fuse compartment 6. In this<br>
exemplary embodiment, the pressure relief device 24 is arranged in<br>
the floor area 28 of the container 10 at a predeterminable<br>
 <br>
position. In order to prevent gases escaping when the fuse<br>
cover 12 is opened, the front bulkhead element 22.5 is arranged<br>
in the cabinet front area 38 of the switchgear cabinet 2 so<br>
that the front bulkhead element 22.5 covers both the front wall<br>
area 34 of the container 10 and the front area of the fuse<br>
compartment 6 so that escaping gases are reliably diverted<br>
downwards. At the same time, the front bulkhead element 22.5<br>
can be divided into a plurality of elements as shown in Figures<br>
7 to 9.<br>
The front bulkhead element 22.5 is designed in the form of a<br>
plate and is as flat as possible and pressure-tight. For<br>
example, the front bulkhead element 22.5 is a steel or plastic<br>
plate. At the same time, the front bulkhead element 22.5 can be<br>
fixed by interlocking, friction and/or bonding to the fuse<br>
cover 12 or some other suitable point.<br>
Figure 6 shows in longitudinal section a switchgear cabinet 2<br>
with a front bulkhead element 22.5 according to the invention.<br>
To reliably divert escaping gases downwards, a guide element 40<br>
can additionally be arranged in the fuse compartment 6 in front<br>
of the front bulkhead element 22.5. In this exemplary<br>
embodiment, a pressure relief device 24 is arranged in the<br>
front wall area 34 of the container 10.<br>
In doing so, the guide element 40 is designed in the form of a<br>
channel in order to deflect and divert the escaping gases. The<br>
guide element 40 can be designed as a section, e.g. a U-<br>
section, an L-section, a hollow cylinder, a tube and/or some<br>
other suitable section for this purpose. The guide element 40<br>
can also be made up of different sections. In order to avoid<br>
additional components, instead of the additional guide element<br>
40, the front bulkhead element 22.5 can be designed in the form<br>
of a channel in a manner which is not shown in more detail. In<br>
particular, the bulkhead element 22.5 is a bulkhead section,<br>
e.g. a U-shaped or L-shaped bulkhead section.<br>
 <br>
Furthermore, the channel K which is formed by one or more guide<br>
elements 40 or one or more bulkhead elements 22.5 is provided<br>
on the output side with at least one control element, e.g. a<br>
valve flap or non-return flap, so that a penetration of gases<br>
from adjacent switch panels (not shown in more detail) into the<br>
fuse compartment 6 is reliably prevented.<br>
Figure 7 shows schematically an enlarged area of the switchgear<br>
cabinet 2 in front view with two front bulkhead elements 22.1,<br>
22.2 arranged in the fuse compartment 6 in a dismantled state.<br>
At the same time, the ends of the plate-shaped front bulkhead<br>
elements 22.1, 22.2 can be attached to the fuse cassettes 20 by<br>
interlocking, friction and/or bonding. The bulkhead elements<br>
22.1, 22.2 each have a number of recesses 42 corresponding to<br>
the number of fuse cassettes 20 for this purpose.<br>
As shown in Figure 8, the respective fuse cassette 20 is<br>
provided with a slot 42 for this purpose into which the<br>
bulkhead elements 22.1, 22.2 can be inserted and fixed by<br>
interlocking. Figure 9 shows the bulkhead elements 22.1, 22.2<br>
mounted on the fuse cassettes 20. At the same time, the<br>
bulkhead elements 22.1, 22.2 cover the cabinet front area 38 so<br>
that the gases are diverted downwards.<br>
