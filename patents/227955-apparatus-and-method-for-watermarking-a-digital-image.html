\PPi^.RVTUS AiND METHOD FOR WATERMARKING A<br>
DIGITAL IMAGE<br>
BACKGROWfD OF THE INVENTION<br>
I,	Field of the Invention<br>
1	The p;e;ic:ni invention relates i:o a method and apparatus for watermarking a<br>
; igirai ^inag'^ T':)e invention may be usefully employed in the newly emerging field : f digiial ciiicnn.<br>
II.	Destrijiiion of the Related Art<br>
In th: tn,ditional film induslrv, theatre operators receive reels of celluloid film from a smdi :• o: through a distributor fcr eventual pi:esen:adon in a theatre :uditoriiim. The reels of film include the feature program (a full-length motion :icture) and a plara ity of previews and other promouoaa! material, often vefeiTed to :^ trai[i:rs. Tliis approach is well established and is basec in technology going back :rouod one hviridred years.<br>
Recentl) an evolution has started m the film industry, with the industry : :iovini: fron) ce'luloid film to digitized image and audio programs. Many advarxed : ichnologiei. iire involved and together rJiose lechnologie.'i i\xc becoming biown as : igital ^inemi;.. It is planned that digital cinema will provide a system for delivering : JO length nictiion pictures, trailers, advertisements and other audio/visual progiiuns :c)mpiising iniaiies and sound at "cinema-quality" to theatres throughout the world . sing digital izc imology. Digital cinema will enable the motion picture cinema [ iduslry to conveit .gracefully from the century-old medium of 35mm film into the :igital/wire]f;:,s oon-munication era of today. This advanced tecnnology will benefit ill segments of Hie movie industry.<br>
The intention is that digital cinema will deliver motion pictures tha: have been :igitized, compiesscd and encrypted lo theatres using either physical media :istribution [such ^s D\T)-PLOMS) or electronic traiismissum methods, such as via ,iatellii:e muUic:].!;t methods. Authorized theatres will aLtomatically receive the<br><br>
dijjuizec progr.ur;3 and store them '"n hard disk storage while still encrypted and<br>
coiipressed. At t ach showing, the digitized informat.ci'! v/ill be retrieved via a local<br>
aji-a net^vork fror/i the hard disk storage, be decrypted, deco.Tipresscd and d:en<br>
di: played iisini; c neina-qualiry elecuonic projectors featunng high qualit&gt; tiigiial<br>
s(».md.<br>
'	[digital :;it;eiria will encompass many advanced t^rcn no logics, including digital<br>
c(nipre;&gt;^ion, tilccrjcnic secuhty methods, network architectjres and management, tr;Jr;Snij:5 5ion te.:i"nologics s.nd cost-effecuvc hardware, softv/are and integrated circuit dt;: iign. The tLThnologies necessary for a cost-effecdve, reliable and secure system art beinj; analyse 1 and developed. These technologies include new forms of image CO npre:&gt;&gt;ion, b:ic.iuse m08t standard cornpression technologies, such as MPEG- 2, are 0]) ::mized for television quality. Thus, aitifacts and other distortions associated with the I technology show up readily when the image is projected on a large screen. \^ lateverthe image compression method adopted, it vvill ailect the eventual quality ol tne projected image. wSpecial compression systems hai/e therefore been designed spt:dtlcally for d:-^atal cineme. applications to provide "'cineaia-quality' images at bit rat^s averaging; le^s than 40 Mbps. Using this technology a 2-hoar movie will require 01 y aboat 40 GB of storage, making n suitable for transpoiiation on such media as sc -called digital versatile disks (DVDs) or transmission or broadcast via a wireless liiK.<br>
V/hiie this has obvious advantages in terms of the distribution of movies, it bmgs w th It A own problems in that i n itself such transpori.ation and transmission is nc" secure. Encrypdon and conditional access methods are therefore also being developed witri th:^ aim of preventing piracy of movicxS. In addition to digital theft, i.e., the L'left of a ];ristine digital copy cf the content of the DVDs and/or transmitted del!a, theie is al;:c the problem of optical theft. Optical theft is the recording of the in ige and audio content of a movie as it is being projected onto the screen of a th.:2.ten <dptic3 tt.sft is easy to perform using for examf le little more than a jancorder.></dptic3><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVEN1 ION<br>
While tliere is no sure way of prevcndng digital or optical theft, it is possible lo reduce the likelihood o); i: occurring by increasing the probability of the l&gt;crpeirators of rie theft being caught. The invention addresses the above-dir.cussed j&gt;r;oblems as;;:'ciated with digital cinema and is useful in overcoming or at least leduciiig the prcblena of digital and optica! theft. To this end the invention aims to |i]:-ovid{i a mtitaod and apparatus for inserting an imperceptible wateiTnark or '^digital lingerprint" into the image content. The watem'iark prefez-ably indrcates al least one o: the location, (late and dmeof showing of the movie, thereby enabhng the location (late and iira^- of the theft to be determined.<br>
Althoug]] the foregoing inti'oduction and folhjwing description concentrate on the inijertion of ;i watermark into an image as the movie is being shown (thereby i nablirg both optical and digital thefi ai: the tiieater to be tracked), it will be i pprccated i:y r. lose possessed of the appropriate skills that the same technique could t (juall)' well :ie Msed in a telecine when original film is converted into digital form (thereby enab.ing digital 2rA optical iheft outside the theater to be tracked^ The ^vate^Tla^k might fcr example identify :iny one or more of ihe location, date and time (Hf cieiiLion Qitiv^ digital version of the film, the tllm ov/ner's identity, or copyright if-fomntion.

The Ibllovving description is intended to provide both an D\'ervievv' of a digital cineiTia system :::\ which the invention may be embodied and a detailed disclosure of 1 IS presently preferred embodiment itself. Systems ;;irriilai' to the system snown ^'erein ire described extensively in ot!:er applications; astngned to the assignee of this application, jxluding USSN 09/564,;.74, entitled, "Apparatus And Method For : ucoding And Slonige Of Digital Image And Audio Signals" and USSN 09/563,880, .^ntitlcc, 'Apparatus And Method For Decoding Digital Image And Audio Signals" hoth f^led Mr/ 3, 2000, the teachings of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
A di^;-.;.al cinema system 100 embodying the invention is illustrated in Figure 1 ::f the cccoinpanying drawings. The digjital cinema system 100 comprises :\vo main ; v/stem;: at Icji^si: one central facility or hub 102 and at least one presentatioa or rheaier ■; jbsystem 10-:|. The hub 102 and the theater subsystem 104 are of a similar design to \]m of pendia:^ US Patent Application Senal No. 09/075,152, filed on May 8, 1998, i;signed to t^c same assignee as the present invention, :he teachings of v;hich are iiicorpc-rated nerein by reference.<br>
Image and audio information are compressed and stored on a storage medium, aid dJstribut^I fronci the hub 102 to the r.heater subsystem 104. Generally, one theater ; jbsy5.tem 104 i*^ utilized for each theater or presentation location in a network of :;resentation iucations that is to re-ceive image or audio uitormation, and includes ; :!me C3ntralii:.ec equipment as well a:; certain equipment employed for each presentation auditorium.<br>
In the '::entral hub 102, a source generator lOS receives film material and :?=ner£.tes a cij^-.il version of the film. The digital information is compressed and K) icrypted by a compressor/encryptor (CE) 112, and stored on a storage medium by a hub storage device 116. A network rrianager 120 monitors and sends control information to t:.e source generator 108, the CE 112, and the hub storage diivice 116. -. condition^] access manager 124 provides specific electronic keying information !■; jch that only specific theaters are authorized to sho^v specific programs.<br>
In the i:heater subsystem 104, a theater manager 128 controls an auditorium module 132. Biisedon control infoimanon received from the auditorium module 132,<br><br>
a tieater storagii device 136 transfers compressed infoni.aticn stored on the storage TTifKJium to a f laybacK modjle 140. The playback module 140 receives the O) Tipres ;ed infonnation frcm the theater storage device 136, and prepares the CO npres &gt;ed information to a predetermined seqaence, size and data rate. The phyback modire 140 outputs the compressed informaiion to a decoder 144, The di; :oder 144 inputs compressed inforraar;(;Ti from the playback mod ale 140 and p<: i decryption decompression and formatting outputs the information to a p ojectci sound mcdule projector plays on pumectci i.lie module phiys iiifonriutior. sysi:em both uii jcr control cf auditorium></:>
In ope]*3ii'0n, the source generator 108 provides digitized electronic image aj '^or programs lo the system. Typically, the source gerierai:or 108 receives film in: terial and g::::ie::ates a magnetic tape containing digitized information or d;ita. The filiri is digitally scanned at a very high -evolution to create the digitized version of the m: tion picture or other prot;rara. Typically, a known 'te-cciae" process geniirates the imige in;'onnat]cn while W'ell-known digital audio conversion processing generates th: audi: portion of the program. The images being processed need not be provided frjra a fi.m, but can be single picture or still frame type images, or a series o:'frames or :)ictun;s, inc:juding those shown as motion pictures of varying length. These im iges cm be presented as a scries or set to create v^-hat are referred to as image pi: i^ami. In addition, other material s.m be provided such as visual cue tracks for si;,;Tt-impaired audiences, subtitling for fcreign language and/or hearing impmred au(l].ence;&gt;, or rnultimedia time cue tracks. Similarly, s:inc;le or sets of sounds or re!::Tdin§;s are used to form desired audio programs.<br>
Altem£:tiV£:ly, a high definition digital camera or odier known digital image ger eration device or method may provide the digitized image information. The use of a d gital cameia. which directly produces the digitized im.age information, is ;js|:e;cially useful for live event capture for substantially iimnediate o: :or lcrDpc^raneoL::s distribution. Computer workstations or similar equipment ::an also 3e ised ro directly generate graphical images that ;ire to be distributed.<br>
Hie digiiial image infoimation oi- program is presented to the co'ipres^Dr/encryptor 112, v/hich compresses the digital signal usmg a preselected<br><br>
tjiown formji cr process, reducing the amount of di^ntal iaformat:on nece£;sary to [eprodnce the original image with very liigh quality. Preferably, an ABSDCT t:chniC;Ue is used to compress the image source. A suitabiC ABSDCT compression txhnjc ue is disposed m U.S. Pat. Ncs. 5,021,891, 5,107,345, and 5,^52,104, the [cachings of v/hich ;ire incorporated herein by reference. The aud:o information may : Iso be digitjJiy corapressad using su.ndard techniqucis and may be ri.nie synchronized \vith the compr;i:sed imaga mformauon. The compressed image and audio iifornution i;^ r:':en encrypted and^or :^crambJed jsing one or more secure electronic tiethcds.<br>
The n( t^^'ork manager 120 mcnitors the status of compres.sor/encryptor 112, nid directs tic compressed information from the compress<jr to the hub storage device is comprised of one or more storage. meiium may be ajiy type high capacity data including but not limited niore digital versarile disks removable t :ird djives upon oj compressed infoitnation onto riedium medijrn physically transported theater subsystem rnd specilically></jr>
Alternai:ively, the compressed image and audio information may each be 5 tored m a nj i- c:ontiguou;; or separate manner independent of each other. That is, a laeans. is prcvjck^d for compressing and storing audio pro;g,tams associated with image infomiation or programs but segregated m time. There is no requiiement to process tne aucio images at the saine time. A predefined identifier or identification ir.echanism or scheme is used to asso:iate corresponding audio and image programs \&gt;/ith erch oLici, as appropriate. This allows lirJang of one or more preselected audio progriLns with at least one preselected image program, as desired, at a time of preseni^tion, or during a presentation event. That is, while not initially time s^^mchrDnizciJ. with the compressed ia^age information, the compressed audio is linked c nd synchronized at presentation of the program.<br>
Furtfier, maintaining the audio program r.epai'ate from the image program 'i Uowii for syichronizing multiple languages from audio program.s to the image program, vvi:;;.o:rt having to recreate tne image program for each language. Moreover, i-aintaining a separate audio progran:; allows for suppo:l: of multiple speaker<br><br>
ci:nfigurat&gt;on&gt; withotif requiring intericiaving ofr/iultiple audio tracks with the image P"]gran.<br>
In additio:! to the image program and the audio program, a sepiu*ate p ■ jmot.onal p:;ograiTu or prnrao progrDm, may be added to (he system. Typically, p' )mot onal rriatciial change^i at a greater frequency tliari the feature prograin. Use of a iepara's pronic program allows prorriotional material to be updated without re quidr j: new feature image programs. The promo prograra comprises iufon'nation sii:h as advcnising (slides, audio, motion or the like) and trailers shown m r'le theater. B:: cause of die high storage capacity of storage media such as DVDs and RlIDs, thousands of slides or pieces of advertising may be stored. The high storage volume allows for custoimzadon, ai&gt; specific slides, advertiscracnts or trailers rnay be shown ai: !jpecific theaters to targeted customers.<br>
^dthou£!;h Figure 1 illustrates the compressed infonnation in the storage device 1 L6 and physically transporting storage mediuni/media to the theater subsystem 104, it: hould be understood that the compressed informadon. or portions thereof, may be tr jfiSniiaed to die :heater storage device 136 using any of a n umber wireless or wired trmsmi-iiion methods. Transmi.ssion niethods mcludc satellite transmission, well-k]i:wn nmlti-dro:', Internet access nodes, dedicated telephone lines, or point-to-point fil;er opt.c networks.<br>
A. block diagram of ihe compressor/encryptor 112 is illustrated in Figure 2 of th: accompanyin,E; drawings. Similar to the source generator 108, the c( npressor/encryptor 112 may be part of the central hub 102 or located in a separate fa: ility. For example, the compressor/encryptor 112 may be located with the source gt;ierato' 108 i]i a film or television production studio. In addition, the compression prc'Cess for eith;!;r image or audio information or data may be implemented a&gt; a VcMable -ate process.<br>
The compressor/encryptor 112 receives a digital image and audio infoiniation pi:vided by the source generator 108. The digital image and audio information may be stored in frame buffers (not shown) before further processing- The digita:! image 5i;:^n.al is Dassed to an image compressor 184. In a prefened embodiment, the image xtripressor 184 processes a digital image signal using the ABSDCT technique le:cnbec in the ahovementioned US. Fat. Nos. 5,021,891, 5.107,345, and 5452,104.<br><br>
fn the ABSDCT technique, the color input signal is generally in a YIQ format, ;'-.th Y being, ihe lutninance, or brigliriiess, component, and I and Q being the ;iromniance, 3r color, components. Other formats suci as the YL'V, YCbQ, or RGB ')miats may also be used. EJecause or the low spatial sensitivity cf rhe eye to color, lis ABSDCT technique sub-sampler; he color (1 and Q) components by a factor of 'vo in i^ach of the horizonta, and veirxal directions. Accordingly, foar liiroinancc i;:mpcnent.s cjul two chrominance components are used to represent each spatial ::.'gment of ijiiaj^e input. The ABS E)CT Technique nlso supports a format called l:4-:4 where iu nonsamplmg of chrominance component takes place. Pixels in each i::mpcnent aie represented digitally in up to 10 bits Imcar or log scale.<br>
Each of the luminance and chrominance components is passed to a block ]iterle3ver. Generally, a 16x16 block is presented to the block interleaver, which orders the image samples within the ]6x 16 blocks to produce blocks and composite :; jb-biocks of data for discrete cosine trc.nsform (DCT) analysis. TheDCT operator is :ne me:hod ol converting a :ime-sa.mplcd signal to a frequency representation of the ume signal. By converting to a freciency representation, che DCT techniques have :een shewn '.o allov/ for very high levels of compression, as quantizers can be designed to tab:: advantage of the frequency distribution characteristics of an image. -icfera3ly, on;; 16x16 DCT is applied to a first ordering, four 8x8 DCTs are applied . t) a second curdering, 16 4x4 DCTs iitt applied to a third ordering, and 64 2x2 DCTs •}cz applied to a fouith ordering.<br>
The T'CT operation reduces the spatial redundancy inherent in the image :; ::urce. After tiM?. DCT is performed, most of the image signal energy tend;; to be c:ncen:rated in a few DCT coefficients.<br>
For the L6xl6 block and each sub-block, the transfc^rmed coefficierrs are ;ina]yzed to determine the number of bits required to encode the block or sub-block. Then, the block '^r the combination of sub-blocks, which requires the least number of :its to encode, is, chosen to represent the image segment. F'or example, two 8x8 sub-:locks, six 4x:4 sub-blocks, and eight 2x2 sub-blocks may be chosen to represent the mage segment.<br>
The chosen block or combination of sub-blocks is then properly arranged in i:rder. The DCF coefficient values may then undergo further processing such as, but<br><br>

The d.i^itai: audio i^ignal is generally passed to an a-idio compressor 192. f leferatly, tlie audio compressor 192 processes rnulti-channel audio uiforrriation u^ing a ;taud;Lrd digital audio compression algorithm. The compressed audio signal is ptovidcil to al least one audio encryptor 196. Altemadvely. tlie audio information nn' be ransterTcd and utilized in an inconiprcssed, but still digital, format.<br>
The ir^agt; encryptor 188 and the audio encryptor 196 encrypts the c:tnprc^sed iinag:; and audio signals, respectively, using any of a number of known ecryplion techniques. The image and audio signals may oc encrypted using the same cr different techniques. In a preferred embodiment, an encryption technique, which c:mpri52S real-time digital sequence scrambling of both image and audio p^:grarrming, :s used.<br>
At the tillage and audio encryptors 188 and 196, the programming material is p':cesscd by ] sc-ambler/encryptor circuit that uses time-varying electronic keying ij: brmaiion (typit;airy changed several times per second). The scrambled program iiTormaiion an then be stored or transmitted, such as over the air in a wireless Jink, \^ ;thout being decipherable to anyone who does not possess the associated electronic ki^Ning iatbnr.aticn used to scramble the program material or digital data.<br>
F.ncry])(icn. generally involves digital sequence scrambling or direct encryption o" ihe ccmpresse:l signal. The words "encryption" and "scrambling'* are used ir t;rcha:igeably and are understood to mean any means of processing digital datii si reams Df various sources using any of a number of ci.7ptographic techniques to sc Mnibjc, cov^r, or directly encrypt said digital streaais using sequences generated u; ng secret d...=;il:£.] values ('keys") in such a way that it :.s very difficult to recover the 01* ginal data sequence without knowledge of the secret key values.<br>

The encrypted program key may also be lansfeired u^i.ng a low dala rate link, or a transportable storage element such as a .v.agnetic or o-Mi::al media disk, a smart card, or other devices having erasable iicmor/ elernr*r.i:,5. The encrypted progrdin key may also be provided in suoh a way as  contiol th
Each theater subsystem 104 that receives an encrypted program key decrypts ih]S val je us rg its auditorium specific key, and stores this decrypted program key in it mcmc»ry device or other secured memory. When the program is to be played back, the thcc.ter or .c:ation specific and progiam specific keying infonuation is used, ])-eferably with a symmetric algoritfim, that was used kn tiie encryptor 112 in p -opanng the. cr.t:ry|)ted sij^al to now descramble/decrypi: program information in ic.'ii-tur.e.<br>
Retuniir,^; now to Figure 2, in addition to scrrLmbling, the image encryptor 188 may adl a "wateimark" or "fingerprint" which is usually digital in nature, to the ur.agc prograraming. This involves rhe msertion of £. location specific and^or time y^Qcifk visui] identifier into the progi*arn sequence. That is, the watermark is instructed to indicate the authorized locarion and time for presentation, for more t;' Yiciently tracking i;he source of illicit copying when necessary. The watermark may bi programni:'d to appear at frequent, but pseudo-random periods in the playback p-Qcess and wDuJd not be visible to ths viewing audience. The waremiark is perceptaally unnoticeable during presentation of decompressed image or audio irformj.tion at v/hat is predenned as a normal rate of transfer. However, the '^ atermark is detectable when the image or audio information is presented at a rate : ■ibstantially different from that non^ial rate, such as at a slower "non-real-time" or ;;iill frame p!a.yba.ck rate. U an unauthorized copy of a program is recovered, the d gital wateri:;:ark infonnadon can be read by auiiioride^:&gt;, and the theacer from which<br><br>
lii cop&gt; was iii2cte can be determined. Such a waterrna]:k technique may also be a:plied or ustc to identify i:hc audio pros;raais.<br>
The corapres.sed and encrypted intage and audio signals are both presented to a nultipie\er 200. At the multiplexer 200. the image and audio information is ni jltiploxed toj:;ether along vvith time synchronization information to allow ;hc image a • d auc.io-stre.;3n"..ed information to be played back in a time aligned manner at the th :ater subsys.tem 104. The multiplexed signal is then processed b\ a program p-cketiz^r 204, which packetizes the data to form the program stream. By p:cketi::ing the data, or fonnjng *'data blocLs," the program stream may be monitored d. ring d^compres^sion at Cae theater subs /stem 104 (see Figure 1) for errors in n: izmviii the :locks during decompression. Requests may be made by the theater ni inager 128 of the theater subsystem 104 to acquire data blocks exhibiting eirors. Accordingly, if ecrors exist, only small poitions of the program need to be replaced, ii .lead cf an ertje program. Requests of small blocks of acta may be handled over a V, ired or wireless link. This provides for mcrcased reliability and efficiency.<br>
.f-\ltem3.tiv::ly. the image and audio portions of a program are treated avS sv. jarate and cistinct programs. Thus, instead of using the n:.uidplexer 200 t^ n iltiplex the image and audio signals, the image signals are separately pacJietized. In t^is way the iinagr. prograiri may be ti*ansported exclusive of the audio program, and vice versa. As :5uch. the image and audio programs are assembled into combined program.? onl)' at playback time. This ;illows for different audio programs to be coiibiniid with ijDage programs for various reasons, such as varying languages, providin,? pos"-release updates orprogiam changes, to fit v/iihin local conomunity st3ndarcli;, and so forth. This ability to flexibly assign audio different multi-track p! ograiru: to irr.age programs is very useful for minimizing costs in altering programs aJi^ady ii distribution, and in addressing the larger multi-cultural markets now a' I liable to the film industry.<br>
The compi-essors 184 and 192, the encryptors 188 and 196, the mul'iplexer 21^), and the program packetizer 204 may be implemented by a cc:npres-£.ion/eni:r]/ption module (CEM) controller 208, a software-controlled pr: cesser progriunmed to perform the functions described lierein. That is, they can be ccnngured as generalized function haicware including a variety of programmable<br><br>
i iectronic dc vi(:(;s or computers that operate under softvvare or firmware program c onlrcil. They rray alternatively be :rnplemented using scaie other technology, such :?, thro Jgh ai ASIC or through one or more circuit card assemblies, i.e., constructed 11. specialized hardvi/are.<br>
The image and audio progra:r si ream is sent lo i.he hub storage device 116. "';"ie CEM ccmtj'ollej: 208 is primanly responsible for controlling and moniloring the ;tvtire compic;&gt;sor/encryptor 112. T^^t CEM controller 208 may be implemented by [ rogrcjnmins a ;,'eneral-purj)ose hard'vv;:J'e device or computer to perform the required fj notions, or by using specialized hardware. Network control is provided to CEM :ontrcller2(]S from the network manager 120 (Figure 2) over a hub internal network, :S described herein. The (TtiM controller 208 communicates with the compressors 184 and 192, Ihe enoryptors 188 and :i9'5, the multip]ext:r 200, and tlie packetlzer 204 . e-ing a biowr: digital interface and controls the oper^ition of these elements. The ;"EM controller 208 may also control and monitor the storage module 116, and the : ata transfer between these devices.<br>
The 5for3.ge device 116 is preteribly constructed as one or more RilDs, DVDs risks o: other high capacity storage mediunv'media, which in general is of similar :esigri as the theater storage device 116 in theater subsystem 104. However, those skilled m the ixi will recognize that in some applications other media m.ay be used<br>

Figure 3 of the accompanying diawings illustrates operation of the auditorium - lodule 132 Jibing one or raore RHDs (removable hard dri^ves) 308. For speed, i:apacit/, and convenience reasons, it may be desirable to use more than one RHD :!08a tc 308n. V/'hen reading data sequentially, some RHDi have a '^prefetching" :^ mature that arrtiinpares a following read command based upon a recent history of cc-nninands. This prefetching feature is useful in that the time required to read :; jquentia] information off the disk is reduced. Flowe ver, the time needed to read non-,:i :quential information off the disk may be increased if the RHD receives a command<br><br>
til it is u lexpectcd. In such a case, the prefetching feature of the RHD may cause the r;i idoiTi access r:u;mory of i:hc RliD to be fuJ!. thus requiring more time to access the ill brraa icn requested. Accordingly, t.aving more than one RIID is beneficial in that a f cquertial sLrearn of data, such as an image program, j::iay be read faster. Funher, a-::essing a seco;:d set of information t.^n a separate Rffl&gt; disk, such as audio p ':)grarr;s, tra: j:irs.. control information, or advertising, is advantageous in that a'.::essing such information on a single RHD is more tirr^c consuming.<br>
T^hus, cotnprcissed information is read from one or more RHDs 308 into a b jffer 284. Tiie FDFO-RAM buffer 284 in the phiyback module 140 receives the pi:rtions of ccmpiressed information from, the storage device 136 at a predetermined nie. The FH'ORAM buffer 284 is of a sufficient capacity i,uch that the decoder 144, a::ij. subsequently the projector 148, is not overloaded or uncer-loadcd with ir;]brmation. Preferably, the FIFO-RAM buffer 284 has a c£.pacily of about 100 to 2'VJ Mli   Use ol' the FIFO-^RiXM buffer 284 is a practical necessity because tiiere may b'.; a sevijral second delay when switching from one diive lo another.<br>
The portions of compressed information is output from the FIFO-RAM buffer into a network .nicrface 2S8, which provides the compressed information to the dt:';oder 144. Frtsferably, the network interface 288 is a l:ibcr channel ai-bitrated loop (I* I--AL.; inteif-icc. Altemadvely, although not specifically illusu'ated, a switch no -.work controiied by the theater manager 128 receives the output data from the pii yback module 140 and directs the data to a given d(icodsr 144. Use of the switch ne. work allow:; programs on any given playback module 140 to be transferred to any gi^en de::oder 144.<br>
V/hen a piogram is to be viewed, the program information is reprieved from thi storage device 136 and transferred :o the auditorium module 132 via the theater rtic nager 128. The. decoder 144 decrypts the data received from the storage <ievice i j using seci key information provided only to authorized theaters and dt tromprasses t.:ie stored the decompression algorithm which is inn erse compression used at source generator ifls. decoder in:ludes a converter shown in figure converts decompressed image an display format by projection system may be eiilier analo o:r digital displayed through electronic></ievice><br>

The (lecc'der 144 vnll now be described in grocih^r detail by further reference to " igure 3. Th^^ decoder 144 processes a compressed/ertcr^'pted program to be visually ;:rojec:(!d on:o a screen or surface anc audibly presented using the sound system 152. 1 he dec:oder 144 compnses a controlling CPU (central processing unit) 312, which ::'ntroI;; the decoder. Alternatively, lie decoder may be controlJec via the theater manager 12^-. The decoder further compnses at least ont depacketi/er 316, a buffer .!14, an irna^^e dccr^^ptor/decompressor 320, and an audio decryptor/decompressor .!24. T le buffer may temporarily store information for the depackctizer 316. All of ihe ab
The drp.acketizer2'16 identifits and separates the individual controi, image, nd aucio packers that arrive from the playback modale 140, the CPU 312 and/or the heatei manager 12?!. Control packets, may be sent to the theater manager 128 while he image and audio packets are sent to "Jie image and audio iacryption/dscompression systems 320 and 324, respectively. Read and write aerations tend to occur in bursts. Therefore, the buffer 314 is used to stream data 1 iioothly from the depacketizer 316 to the projection equipment.<br>
The theater manager 128 configures, manages the security of, operates, and uonitO]-s the Ueater subsystem 104. This includes the external interfaces, iimage aDd lidio decryption/decompression modales 320 and 324, along with projectc^r 148 and he sound system module 152, Controi information cones from the playback module i 40, tho CPU 312, the theater manager system 128, a remote control port, or a local : )ntro'. input, such tis a control panel on the outside of the auditorium modal? 132 ijusin^. or ch^issis. The decoder CPL 312 may also manage the electronic keys . ;signe j to ecich auditorium module 132. Pre-selected elecrronic cryptographic keys . ;signe3 to auditorium module 132 are used in conjunclicn with the electronic<br><br>
cryptographic key information that is embedded in the imags and audio data to de crypi the inuig:: and audio information before tae decompression process. Picferatly, th:: CPU 312 uset a standard microprocessor running snibedded in the S':ftwait of e;^:h auditorium module 1.32, as a basic funct^^nal or control clement.<br>
In addition, the CPU 312 is preferably configured to work or communicate C'^rtain iifontaiicn vdth theater manai^er 128 to maintain a history of presentations c: cumng in eacli auditorium, Information regarding thiii presentation history is then a i ailable for transfer to the hub 102 using the return Imk, or through a transportable ru:diuni at preselected times.<br>
^^c imi:;ge decryptor/decomprcssor 320 takes the image data stream f:^om d:packe:izer*!JCs performs decryption, adds a watennark and reassembles the original image for presentation on the screen. The output of this oix^ration generally provides suiadard analog RGE» signals to digital cinema projector 148. Typically, decryption a ^d decompression are performed in real-time, allowing for real-time playback of the p.'jgraraming material.<br>
The image decryptor/decompressor 320 decry]:)ts and decomxpresses the image d3ta stream to re^/ersc the operation performed by the image compressor 184 and the irr.age eiicryptor 188 of the hub 102. Each auditoriumi m.odule 132 may process and d. 5play a different: program from other auditorium modules ;132 in the same theater sut'System ,104 or one or more auditorium modules 132 may process and display the sa lie progi-am simultaneously. Optionally, the same program may be displayed on n. iltipliJ projectors, the multiple projectors being delayed iii time relative to each oi:ier.<br>
The decry]:tion process uses previously provided unii:-specific and program-spxific ilectrcnic cryptographic key information in conjunction with the electronic k;;ys embecded in the data stream to dtjciypt the image information. Each theater su :systeii 10^1 is provided with the necessar&gt;' cryptographic key information for all programs authorised EG be shown on each auditorium module 132.<br>
.^. multi-le/el cryptographic key manager is used to authorize specific p:ic:5entaiion s]/5.terns for display of specific prognmis. This multi-level key manager ty]&gt;:.caily unlize;&gt; eleclxonic key values which are specific to each authorized tlieater iTii.nager 128, i;he specific image and/or audio program, and^or a time varying<br><br>
cryptographic kc;y sequence within the image and/or audio program. An '^auditorium i pecific" electronic key, typically 56 biLs or longer, is programmed into each cuditc&gt;:ium module 132.<br>
This progra'TimJns may be inip!':^mented using several techniques V) transfer ;.nd pi.-cseat tf^e Ley information for use. For example, Lae return link disc\issed above inay be ur&gt;ecl hxough a link to transfer tne cryptographic infoimation from the c ondiuional access manager 124. Alternatively, smart card technology such a.s smart ( ard 328, pr^: programmed Hash meniory cards, and other known portable storage devices nmy !)e used.<br>
For example, the smart card 32S may be designed so that cliis value, once loaded in':o '.he card, cannot be read from the smart caj'd memoiy.<br>
Physical and electronic security measuies are used to prevent tampering with this key infe-nTiation and to detect attempted tampering or compromise. The key is jtored in such a way that it can be erased in the event of detected tampering attempts. '^'he smart caid circuitry includes a microprocessor core including a software irnplerienta'..on of an enci^ption algorithm, typically Data Encryption Standard (DES)  The snuxl card can input values provided to it, encrypt (or decrypt) these ^aluejj using the on-card DES algorithm and the pre-stored auditorium specific key. end output t-.c r-'-suit.

Image: |:'i*ogram daca streams undergo dynamic image decompression using an inverse ABSDCT algorithm or other image decompression process symmetric to the iraage compression used in the central hub compressor/encryptor 112. If image c ompressiotL is based on the ABSDCT ;dgorithm the decompression process includes ^';iriab]e length decoding, inverse frequency weighting, inverse quantization, inverse cjiferenti;il cjuad-tree traniiformation, K)CT, and DCT block combiner deinterleaving. ■^he processing elements used for decompression may be implemented in dedicated speciaJized hardware configured for this function such as an ASIC or one or more :ircui;: card a.^isemb.ies.

Dig'tal vv c.:ermarks are applied to the image daa before die image is output for display by the projector. The watermarks are applied by the image d;i:ryptcr/dec:nr.pressor 320 before the data is output to the projector 14S for display of the image that it represents.<br>
Meferrirg now to Figure A of th-^ accompanying drawings, relevant paits of the d rjryptcr/deciivnpressor 3W for applyiiis a watermark to ihe image are- shown therein. T' e dccrypLor/decom.prcssor 320 comprises a compressed data interface (CDI) 401, wtj.ch receives the depacke-ised, compressed and encrypted data from tiie d*i:ackeiiser 316 (see Figure 3). Data lerds to be moved around and processed in bursts, a id so iJie received data is stored m a random access store 402, which is pirJerab^y an &gt;1'DRA!^ device or simikx, until it is needed. The data input to the S.I^RAJ^'] store 41)2 corresponds to compressed and encrypted versions of the image di a. The stoie 402, i:herefore&gt; need not be very large (relatively spealdng) to be able to store data c jiresponding to a large number of image frajncs.<br>
From time to time, the data is tciken from the store 402 by the CDI 401 and on .put ic a decryption circuit 403 wher^ it is decrypted using a DES (Data Encryption Standard) key  The DES key is specific to the encryption performed at the central fa: ility 102 (si;e Figure 1) and, therefore, enables the incoming data to be decrypted. Ti= data may cJsc be compressed before li is transmitred from the central facility, uE^ing lossless techniques including Huffman or run-length encoding and/or lossy te':hniqui*.s including block quantization in which the value of the data in a block is di s ided by a power of 2 (i.e, 2 or 4 or 8. etc). The decryptor/decompressor 320 thus cc:nprises a decoripressor, e.g., an inverse quantization block (Huffraan/IQB) deicompnjssor 404 that decompresJies the decrypted data. The decompressed data from the HuffmaaTQB decompressor 404 represents the image data in the DCT Iciiiain.<br>
S;nce iic system already comprses the necessary hardware and software to ifl'ict DCT ooPApi'ctssion techniques, specifically the above-mentioned ABSDCF<br><br>
■.;:mpression technicue, to compress data, the same is uued '-:o embed a watei-mark into i!ie picture m th,^? DCT doaain, Othej- transfomuitioris could, of course, be used but ■; iica t:ie hardvvitrc i^ already there in the s-ysteni this offers the most cost-effective 'i)luncri.<br>

Tlie cata from the watem^ark processor 405 ,s then input to an inverse OCT i;';msfoniiirig circuit 406 where ihe data is conveited from the DCT domain into nage ciaia iri the piJvel domain.<br>
rhi thus produced pixel data is input to a frame buffer interface 407 and aisociaied SIJRAM store 408. The frame buffer intetface 407 and associated store 40'8 ser/es as a buffer m which the pixel data is held for reconstruction in a suitable "ormat "or diiiphr/ of the image by a pixel image processor 409. The SDRAM store IC'8 may be c»f a similar stze to that of the SDRAM store 402 associated with the .; impressed d£:ta interface 401. However, since the data input to the frame buffer interface 407 represents the image in the pixel comain, data for only a comparatively ; iiall nimbe.r of image frames can be stored in rhe SDRAM store 408. This is not a liroblem because the purpose of the frame buffer interface 407 is simply to reorder the data from ihe inverse DCT circuit and present it for refoiinatting by the pixel image f.rocessDr 409 at the display rate.<br>
The decompressed image data goes through digital to analog conversion, and ilvs ana:og sij^nals ai*e output to projector 148 for display of the image represented by \]K image da:a-. The projector 148 presents the electronic representation of a program i:n a scieen. The high quality projector is based on advanced technology, such as iquid crystal liiiht valve (LCLV) methods for processing optical or image .iformi.tion. The projector 148 receives an image signal from image ■iecryptor/decornpressor 320, typically in standard Red-Green-Blue (F:GB) video :; jpial fDimat. Alternatively, a digital interface may be used to convey the 'lecompresised digital image data to the projector 148 obviiaung the need for the 'Ugital-'.o-imalog process. Information transfer for control end monitoring of the ,:rojeci(&gt;r 14S' is typically provided over a digital serial interface from the controller<br><br>

The v/atemvirking information is inserted into the video data in such a way that all information contained in the watermark is readable dunng any contiguous segment of the. mot on imag^' program of no more than five minutes in duradon.<br>
The Wt:te3'jiiark processor 405 t^mpioys a DES en gins? that is keyed to the pu&gt;graiii key. This serves three purpose^;. Firstly, the watermark pattern cannot be predicted t»ecaa;;e the sequence is tied to a non-linear noise generator. Secondly, the v' 3term:irk is specific to the individual program and ensures the pirate cannot tamper v/ lii it, despiie having compromised another program or being aware of the v ueniiark technique. Thirdly, the watermark is imperceptible because it is masked in a loise-ike rarccm sequence, i.e., the code generated by the DES engine.<br>
]t ks a.ssunjed that a video pirate v/ill know that the movie material he is sioiiling will contain a watermark of seme origin. He may not be able to perceive it or sijip it f'om tic; image, but he may be able to alter it using some or all of the followirg tne::;ods.<br>
BEiic manipulations such as resolution scaling and cropping occur when the p ;:grara is rei:orded onto a video camera or similar device. The digital cinema d ;;play format c;:.i^ be as large as 2560 x 1088; most consumer equipment is limited to a laaxirrum of 800 x 600 pixels (SVHS). This implies a resolution scaling operadon an:, possibly ai JO a cropping operation. The video pirate may decide to capture the en:ire \^':dth of the image (letterbox format) or a fraction of i: (pan and scan).<br>
C'ompex manipulations such as inter-frame averaging occur when two video fruaes .Tom the liame scene are used tC' average out the areas that have been<br><br>
'vatemaike::. One form of this inter-frame averaging wculd occur when the charge-( oupl^d cevice (CCD) hi a video camera converts the 24 or 30 fps of the projector into its inteiiml refresh ra':e.<br>
Ano':her complex manipulation attack can occur when the same program s equerce is cipv.urcd from different projectors with different watermark identification c odes. Thie sets of frames can be compared to idenbfy which portions of a frame are marked and avcuage those out. A vaiiaiion on this scheme, collusion, uses two copies ur the jKogriirn <o identify marked portions and then modifies them to fabricate a false of third copy. further coraplex manipulation image warping involves t.sing : geom: transfoiination on every fran under this scheme bits arc noved slightly new positions so that the appears untouched but s cetector cannot locate bits.></o>
The wahirmark processor 405 compnses a number of registers 421 to 425 that f <: viiriabliii- used in the watermarking process. registers and hold data cspeclivt-ly ide ttie projector one ir. which theatre time of : isplay program. identity stamp are input :z an e:torcdxection unit where forv- error con-ecti.on i.e. convolutional lodini is appli-fd. corrected from con to a spreading blo-ck together with factor register block spreadf: bits so as make y more robust against short-period mampulations. inction perx>nned by the spreading block 429 may, for example, duplicate each iput bit a number of times r?efore moving on to the next bit. This enables the data to :e spread within, a frame ^vith the coce changing on a frame-by-frame basis, or to be spread over i^evera! frames with the code changing after a predetermined numiber of .'^Ames.<br>
The watermark processor 405 also comprises a DBS engine 432. The DES ;;ngine 432 generates DES codes entii'ely independently c&gt;f the DES codes used by the ,;iES decryption unit 403 (see Figure 4), The DES key used by the DES decryption unit 403 pertains to the encryption and decryption of ih^ data from the central facility f see Fi.gure I) whereas the DES key generated by the DBS engine 432 is specific to i)ie theater ajid/cr the projector I which the movie is displayed.<br><br>
7ho JDES mgim 432 is used to generate a pseudo-random noise (?l^) s::querK:^ for '^jnbedding the watermark data into the movie bits. A program key is loaded f^ora register 424 intc the DES engine 432 at the stait of the program, and used tJrDughour thf- p-ogram. At :he beginnirg of e:ich frame, the initia! vector is loaded V,' th the current iTarre number. The DES engine 432 is configured in output feedback niide. la this mimner, a long-period PN sequence is geriera:ed that is unique for e .ery fvanae cf every prograii,i. The th JS generated long PN sequence is outpat to an e <clcsiv>C)R (XOR) combiner 433 where it is combine J on a bit-by-bit basis with tic ? dat£. from ihe spreading block 429.<br>
/vn aniplJude control block 434 identifies the level at which each DCT ci:efficient is marked. Amplitude control is accomplished by determining the n I ignitu.je of ciich DCT coefficient and using the magnhucki of the DCT coefficients to index data in n look-up tabic. The niajjnitude of the coefficient is determined as \oi2 of -he absol.ite coefficient value. The DCT transfoim domain has the advantage tl; It watermarks are adaptable because the strength of the watermark depends on the ir cnsity value*, o! the DCT coefficients of the original image. The witermcirk is n: ide strong in the DCT coefficients with large intensity values and is attenuated in aio;as vviih small DCT values.<br>
Although amy color component may be used. Figure 5 illustrates only DCT coefficients for the luminance (Y) component of the image arc input to the amplitude control block 434 (and indeed to the watermark processor 405). In this embodiment, the DCT ccef:i;ients relating to the color different components (CR and CB) of the ir::age bypass the watermark processor 405 entirely. This is because the color dnference corooiients (CR and CB) by themselves cannot be used to produce a ixit:aningful im&amp;ge but the luminance (Y) component may be used to create a black-art j-white version of the image. Processing the DCT coefficients for the Y coiiponcnt reduces processing overheads. In another embodiment, the CR aid/or Cs cu iiponents a;"e input to the watermark processor.<br>
The amplii.ude coniiol block 434 produces an ;unplitude value that is passed to a narking control block 436. The marking control block 43i$ controls the actual selection of th^ components to mark. Ii decides which DCT coefficients are marked ard in wliat types of sub-bJocks. Any block size (16x16, 8x8, 4x4, 2x2) may be<br><br>
marked, whether the block ii; deemed perceptually significant or not. In an :irnbociiment, both perceptually significant and other blocks are marked. In another ■iaboc.iment, peiceplually significant blocks are not jnarked. The marking control l.iiock 436 concerts the wareiinark value from the XOR combiner 433 into a negative vduc ['{) if .he watermark bit is a zero (0) and into a posjtive value (-t-1) if the '^'aterriark b.x is a one (1). The marking conrrol block 43'^ also decides whether or not the watennaik data will actually be incorporated into the DCT coefficients for the luminance cotaponent. To this end the marking control block examines the value of I lie coc Ticient and/or the amplitude value from the amplitude control block together vMth ot^ier information (including block size) peitaining to the DCT coefficients. illenerally, waiermai-king h not applied l;o coefficients whose log2 value is zero since ilus may intrcnkce a noise into the image. Such noise would probably be visible in I lie image and ii; therefore unacceptable. When watermarking is to be applied the i:ositi\t; (H-1) or negative (-1) value is added to the luminance (Y) data.<br>
The data output from the martmg controi block 436 are input to an adder 438 '/Mere they ace added to the DCT coei'ficients for the luminance componen: of the i.nage. In this v/ay, the watermark data is applied to the image data while still in the OCT domair. Apart from the DC components, all DCT coefficients are considered as ■ .:andid^.te&amp; fc»: tlie application of watermark data. The data is applied depending on among other uings ^.he amplitude of a coefficient. The application of watermarking tt2X<i to a dcr ccheffciem will have an effect on area in the image since each dct : ci:intnbutes several pixels image. it follows therefore that iirapplied substantially whole of and not just selected :ortion5 it. this make watermarking more robust such attacks as discussed herein above.></i>
Thos^ posse:5sed of the appropnate skills will appreciate from the foregoing : lat the watermark is constructed to indicate the authorized locadon and time for ::esentation, for more efficiently tracing the source of illicit copying whe:a " ecessiiry. The watermark may appear at frequent, but deterministic periods in the :layb^.ck prcce.sj; and is not visible to the viewing audience. The watermark is :erceptQally unnoticeable during presentation of decompressed image or audio ifonriaiion at v/hat is predefined as a normal rate of transfer. However, the<br><br>
V .Uennark mrj be detectable, although not perceptible, when the image or audio ill 'orma'.ion i:; pKisented at a rate substantially different I'rom that normal ra-.e, such as a. a slov/er "rcn-real-time" or stjli frame playback rate. If an unauthorized copy of a P':grarr is recovered, the digital watennark infoimaiion CK be read by authorities, a:id the heater fn:&gt;m which the copy was made can be determined.<br>
^.."he waterma::ked DCT data thus produced by the watermarking pro*;:cssor 405 n- input LO the inverse DCT unit 406 where it is converted into pixel data as has ai] tiady 3een explained herein with reference to Figure 4. Tius, the di;:ryptca'/cecompressor320 serves to decrypt the incoming data, decomptess it, apply a n-aternark, corivert the data from tht DCT domain t;o the pixel domain and Hiconstract the pixels into a suitable format: for display of the image by the projector 118.<br>
The audio decryptor/cecompressor 324 shown m Figure 3 operates in a similai-Hi inner on thtt mdio data, although it does not apply data representing a vvalcmiark or fir geip.T: nt to the audio signal. Of course such a watermark technique may lilso be a]):lied or used to identify the audio piogi-anis, if desired. The audio d.::ryptcr/ceco'.Tipressor 324 takes the audio data stream from the dopacketi;:er 316, pi i'forms decryption, and reassembles the original audio for presentation on a theater's speakers or audio sound system 152. The output of this operation provides stEiidard line Jev^jl audio signals to the sound system 152.<br>
S imilar to the image decryptor/decompressor 320, the audio dc:ryptcr/dec:&gt;;:rpressor32^i reverses the operation perfcrrned by the audio c(i iipres5or 192 and the audio encryptor 196 of the hub 102. Using electronic keys fr: m the cryptcgraphic smart card 32S in conjunction with the electronic keys eif bedde.d in !ha data stream, the decr&gt;ptor 324 decrypts the audio information. The decrypted audio data is tlien decompre.ssed.<br>
^LUdio decompression is perfonned with an algorithm symmetric to that used at he central hub 102 for audio compression. Multiple audio channels, if present, are dtoompres&amp;ed.  The number of audio channels is dependent on the muld-phonic sc und system di^sjgn of die particular auditorium, or present£.tion system. Additional atdio channels may be transmitted from the central hub 102 for enhanced audio [)r:'gram]ning fur pur|&gt;oses such as multi-language audio tracks and audio cues for<br><br>
nght irapair^i audiences. The system may aiso provide aaditional data tracks<br>

(racks, suDtitlmg, and special visual cue tracks for hearing' impaired audiences.<br>
As discussed earlier, audio and data tracks iray be :irae synchronized to the iraage DrograiTts^ or may be presented as.ynchronously v/itiiout direct time synchronization. Image programs may consist of single frames (i.e., still images"), a sequence of sui;2le frame still images, or motion image sequences of short or long (lurarion.<br>
If neci.:;ssary, the aadio channels are provided lo ar, audio delay element, which ir.serts a delay as needed !:o synchronize the audio with the appropriate image frame, liach c:iannel then goes through a digital to analog conversion to provide what are Ijiown as 'line lever' outputs to sour.d system 152. That is, the appropriate analog level or format sigrals are generated from the digital data to drive the appropriate sound system. The line level audio outputs typically u.se standard XLR or AES/EBU c onnectois iound in most theater sou id systems.<br>
Rcfenrng back to Figure 3, the decoder chassis 14^ includes a fiber channel interface .28ii, the depacketizer 316, the decoder controller or CPU 312, the image (lecryp:or/deccrapressor 320, the audio decryptor/decompressor 324, and the c r&gt;pto<aphic :i.mart card the decoder chassis is a secure self-contained c hassis that alsc houses thte encryption smart interface internal power supply reguladon cooling fans necessary local conu panel and external interfaces. tie control may use any of various known input devices such as rr.e switch fla: with embedded led indicators. locd typrcally uses or foi-ms part hinged access door to allow entry into interior for service maintenance. this has lock prevent unaudiorizec. theft tampering system. during installation contairdng keying information auditorium specific key installed inside secured behind locked front panel. :typto iirnait slot accessible only signal output from tlie image decryptor projector connected securely within in way yiq signals annol be accessed while mounted housing.></aphic><br>
S'^curity inter, ocks may be used to prevent operation of ':he decoder 144 when it is not correctly instcilecl to the projector 148.<br>
The sc*und system 152 presents the audio portion of a program on the theater's speakers. Preferably, the sound system 152 receives up to 12 channels of standard f(j mat audio signals, either in digital or analog format, from, the audio d.ijryptcr/dccoirpressor 324.<br>
/Utema;ively, the playback mo-iule 140 and the decoder 144 may be integrated ino a S'.ngle playback-decoder unit 132. Combining the playback module 140 and the di;::oder raoduje 148 results in cost and access time savings in that only a single CPU (-:/&gt;2 or 312) is needed to serve the functions of both the playback module 140 and the di.;:oder 144. Combination ox the playback module 140 ard the decoder 144 also does n-Jt requ.re the ij;::e of a fiber channel interface 388.<br>
[f muln/ple viewing locations are desired, information on any storage device 136 is cc»nfigured to Ixansfer compressed information of a single image program to d.;Jferert audilcriums with preselected programmable offsets or delays in time relative to each cither. Tficse preselected programmable offsets cxt made substantially equal to ;^,ero cr very umall when a single image program is to be presented to selected nr;ultiple auditodums substantially simultaneously. At other times, these offsets can be- set anywhere from a few minutes to several hours, depending on the storage ccnfigurition and capacity, in order to provide very flexible presentation scheduling. Tins allcws a theater complex to better address market demands for presentation c^'^nts such as first run films.<br>
The theater manager 128 is illustrated in greater detail in Figure 6 of the accompanying; 'i'awings. Turning now to Figure 6, the tneater manager 128 provides 0]»iraticfual control and monitoring of the entire presentation or theater subsj^stem KH, or cne or more auditorium modules 132 within a theater complex. The theater ir.Enager 128 may also use a program control means or mechanism for creating piogram SQts from, one or more received individual image and audio programs, which II: scheduled for presentatian on an auditorium system dunng an authorized interval. The thciiter manager 128 comphses a theater manager processor 336 and may DIvjonaJly contiun at least one modem 340, or other device that interfaces with a •eum lirk, for i-ending messages back to cenn-al hub 102. The theater manager 128<br><br>
:nay include a visual display element such as a monitor and a user interface device ;aich ai; a keybo;\rd, which may reside ia a theater complex manager's office, ticket booth, or any orter suitable location that is convenient for theater operations.<br>
The t.eater manager processor ii6 is generally a litandard commercial or business jzrade computer, J'he theater manager procesiior 336 communicates with the netwcik manager 120 and condition^.! a-cess manager 124 (see Figure 1). Preferably, ihe modem 340 is used to communicate with the central hub 102. The modem 340 is ;;ener;illy a ttancard phone Hne modem, that resides m or is connected to the ■}roce:&gt;.ior, and connects to a standarc two-wire telephone line to communicate back to he certral huo 102. Altematively, c;)mmunications betv/een the theater manager )roce:&gt; jor 336 and the central hub 102 may be sent using other low data rate i;i^mmimioation!; methods such as Internet, private or public data netv/orking, vireless, or satellite comrQunication syii':ems. For these alternatives, the modem 340 s configured to provide the appropriate interface structure.<br>
Tlie -.heater manager 128 allows each auditorium m,oduIe 132 to communicate vith each storage device 136. A theater management module interface may include a )uffer memory such that information bursts may be transferred at high data rates from 'he theater s:orage device 136 using the theater manager interface 126 and processed r. slow er rate:&gt; by other elements of the auditorium module 132.<br>
Infomialion comnmnicated betvv'een the theater manager 128 and the network nanagir 120 a::id/o:r the conditional access manager 124 include requests for ctransmission c)f portions of information received by the theater subsystem 104 that ijxhibiling uncorrectable bit errors, monitor and contro.^ i:nformation, operations eports and alatras, and ciyptographi: keying inform.ation.

Throngli either control of theater manager 128 or the network n-ianagcr 120, ihe inve-ntion reneraily supports simultaneous playback and dispiay of recorded frograriminj^ -m multiple display projectors. Furthermore, under control of theater manager 128 jr the network manager 120&gt; authorization of a program for playback uiultiplo times can often bt; done even though theater siibsystem 104 only reeds to icceive the pr-jgr^mming once. Security management may control the period of time ;. -id/or the number of playbacks that are allowed for each program.<br>
Throii.^;h automated control of the theater manager 128 by the network Kianagement nicdule 112, a means is provided for automatically storing, and ]»resent:ng programs. In addition, iheie is the abihty to concrol certain preselected ii itwork opera:ions from a location remote from the central facility using a control t'crnerii. For example, a television or film studio could automate and control the (! stributioTi cf films or other presentations from a centre! ;.o::alion, such as a studio C' Tree, and mr^e almost in'imediatc changes to preseniationii to account for rapid clianges in market demand, or reaction to presentations, or for other reason I iderstood ir the art.<br>
The th::a(:cr subsystem 104 may be connected with the auditorium module 132 i;;;mg a theater interface network (not shown). The theater interface network csi:eru(s) 132 of the theater subsystem 104. The theater interface network 126 may be implemented using any of a number of standard local area network atchitectures which exhibit adequate data transfer rates, connectivity, and reliabihty SI ch as arbitrated loop, switched, or hub-oriented networks.<br>
lEach storage device 136, as shown in Figure 1, provides for local storage of t:ia proErarnn:u.ng material that it is authorized to playback and display. The storage s ystem may b;:' centralized at each theater system. In this case the theater storage<br><br>
