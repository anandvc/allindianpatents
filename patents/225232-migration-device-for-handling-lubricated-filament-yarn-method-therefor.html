				<td>Technical Scope This invention relates to migration device for handling<br>
lubricated filement yarn and method therefor.<br>
The invention pertains to a method and device for treating filament yarn in a yarn channel of a<br>
nozzle, by feeding of the blowing medium into the yarn channel<br>
State-of-the-art Technology<br>
Treatment of endless filament yarn mainly has two tasks. Firstly, the yarn, manufactured<br>
from industrially produced filaments, should be given a textile character and also textile-<br>
technical properties. Secondly, the yarn is treated with respect to specific quality of features<br>
for further processing and/or for the end product. Partly, yarn qualities must be produced,<br>
which are not necessary or even not attainable in case of products manufactured with natural<br>
fibres. The scope of application lies in the industrial processing of textile, e.g. for the<br>
building sector, automobile construction, and also for carpet manufacture and for special<br>
textile products in the sports and leisure industry Furthermore, spun yarn should be treated<br>
with certain lubricants for the best possible industrial processing and the processing method<br>
for yarns and fabrics must be optimised. Optimization means here also retaining or increasing<br>
certain quality criteria and decrease of production costs, which includes idle periods during<br>
the entire processing path.<br>
Certified that this document (total 17 pages including this one) is a true translation of the<br>
original German document presented under reference number PCT/CH 00/00120.<br>
In filament spinning, various treatments, like lubrication and finishing of yarn with yarn<br>
treatment nozzles, are an important section. Structural change of plain yarn to a texturized or<br>
intermingled yarn is brought about with the help of mechanical air forces. In case of<br>
texturing, one would like to give the plain yarn a textile character. With a supersonic charge,<br>
small loops are formed on the filaments and thus a large volume is generated on the entire<br>
yarn. During intermingling, knots are formed on the yarn at short distances, which increase<br>
the holding together of the yarn and provide a stable run of the yarn during processing and<br>
spooling. Air treatment nozzles are used for improving the structure of a yarn. A very<br>
demanding process is the improvement of the quality by treating with hot steam, for example<br>
for relaxing during a drawing process or after any other prior process intervention. In all<br>
cases, the nozzle bodies are made of highly wear-resistant material, as otherwise their life<br>
span would be too short. A not too insignificant problem source for yarn treating nozzles lies<br>
in the preparation. Thereby a yarn is provided with protective substances immediately after<br>
the spinning sequence, or generation of individual filaments. The protective substances are<br>
supposed to be a help for the subsequent processing. The substances used for the preparation<br>
have an oily sliding property, so that the sliding friction of the yarn remains as low as possible<br>
over the entire path of processing, the danger of damage or breaking of the yarn gets<br>
minimized and the wear and tear on the sliding surfaces of the transporting processing units<br>
can be kept as low as possible. However, there are a series of further factors which are<br>
positively influenced by the preparation or the preparation agent, e.g. static charges. Another<br>
area is the protection against fungus attack of the yarn during storage periods between the<br>
various processing stages.<br>
Another very important stage for filament yarn is the stretching. After the filaments leave the<br>
spinning nozzles, the thus formed yarn must be stretched. Stretching demands a more or less<br>
plain/smooth yarn, which is not ensured in case of a textured yarn. In quite a lot of<br>
applications there is a need to give the yarn a minimum binding. The binding should however<br>
only be so intensive, that the subsequent processing stages are not negatively influenced. It is<br>
known, that in a spinning process, after applying the preparation agent an intermingling<br>
nozzle is attached. In this way only very weak knots are formed on the yarn, or perhaps even<br>
only hints of knots, in order to stabilize the immediate subsequent transportation.<br>
Disadvantageous thereby is, finding of optimum condition or an optimum compromise<br>
between no knots or indications of knots. For this, till today known intermingling nozzles<br>
with bad utilization of air treatment or with only very weak swirl formation, mainly with<br>
relatively low pressure of the treating air, are used. In practice, often the uniformity and<br>
consistency of the thus obtained yarn structure suffers In the state-of-the-art technology there<br>
is no stable treatment possibility for yarn or a suitable device which generates that much of<br>
filament binding that a calm and stable yarn run is ensured, without disadvantage for<br>
subsequent interventions or process stages or with respect to structural changes.<br>
The document DE 41 02 790 deals with a specific problems in case of false twisting crimping<br>
machines and suggests a conveyor nozzle. For this purpose, the conveyor air is blown into<br>
the nozzle channel at an angle of say 20° to the yarn run direction. During the almost<br>
exclusive conveying effect the yarn remains almost unchanged. The document US-PS 4 214<br>
352 suggests a texturising nozzle for generation of a loop yarn A blow-in angle of approx.<br>
45° is shown.<br>
Presentation of the Invention<br>
It is the task of this invention to develop a method as well as yarn treatment nozzles, which<br>
allow a prior bonding of the yarn binding, particularly with the highest possible consistency of<br>
a light structural intervention The objective was to generate the binding even at the highest<br>
speed of yarn transportation immediately after the spinning nozzle and, for example, directly<br>
in connection with the job of lubrication agents of, e.g. 3'000 - 7'000 /min. It was specially<br>
part of the job to improve the conditions for treatment of yarn with respect to lubrication<br>
agents, productivity, especially yarn quality even at the highest speeds.<br>
The method as per the invention has the special feature, that the blowing medium is<br>
introduced into the yarn channel in the thread running direction under an introductory angle<br>
with an angular inclination a to the vertical with respect to the thread run direction; this angle<br>
is greater than 15°, however lesser than 45°. The filaments of the lubricated yarn get mixed<br>
and lightly crossed without generating any knots.<br>
The device as per the invention has the special feature, that the device is designed as<br>
migration nozzle, with a compressed air feeding channel directed into the yarn channel in yarn<br>
run direction, which has an inclination greater than 15°, however smaller than 45°, from the<br>
vertical to the yarn run direction.<br>
The invention further pertains to the application of the device for a good through-mixing as<br>
well as uniform distribution of the lubrication agent on the filament yarn, whereby the<br>
filaments get joined to a slightly crossed but knot-free yarn and the lubrication agent is<br>
simultaneously distributed optimally over the entire yarn.<br>
The invention allows a large number of particularly advantageous design forms. <br>
Practice shows that with increasing transportation speed of the yarn, e.g. in the range for<br>
polyester higher than 3500 m/min., PP higher than 3000 m/min. and for polyamide higher<br>
than 4200 m/min , the thread run becomes unsteady and unstable in spite of the lubrication.<br>
This instability increases further with further increase in the spinning yarn speed This<br>
becomes problematic for higher multiple end spinning positions, and primarily holds goods<br>
for deflection or drawing rollers in pre-oriented POY and finish-oriented FOY-/ as well as<br>
fully stretched FDY-spinning processes. A further aspect lies therein, that always a closer<br>
division is endeavoured due to machine-structural and process-technical reasons, so that at the<br>
same machine depth where previously there were four yarn runs, today one strives for 8 to 10<br>
In case of thinner division there increases the danger, that the filaments come in contact with<br>
one another due to the adjacent yarn runs, spring out and then immediately cause a break in<br>
thread. Even due to ecological and economic reasons, the application of lubrication agents<br>
with corresponding contacts of lubrication lips cannot be arbitrarily increased.<br>
All earlier experiments showed that the region around 15° for the introduction angle of<br>
blowing air into the yarn channel or on the longitudinal central axis LM of a intermingling<br>
nozzle also at the same time poses a barrier. Mostly, in case of intermingling nozzles, the air<br>
charge is directed vertically on the longitudinal central axis, for generation of two uniform<br>
swirls in the yarn channel. All experiences so far have shown that, the more the direction of<br>
the blowing air was inclined, say in the range of approx. 10 to about 15° to a vertical with<br>
respect to the yarn run, the more the air has a conveying component and also the more the<br>
intermingling nozzles lost their actual function, namely generation of intermingling knots<br>
Therefore, in case where a certain air treatment by way of intermingling nozzle was wanted,<br>
however without knot formation in the yarn, it was convenient to take an intermingling nozzle<br>
of the state-of-the-art technology, however simply reducing the air pressure to such an extent<br>
till, due to lack of energy the compressed air no longer would form any knots. The<br>
disadvantage was, that the reproduceability of the result left a lot to be desired.<br>
Systematic series of experiments with the new solution surprisingly showed, that in the region<br>
greater than by 15° for the introduction angle, by suitable adjustment of the blowing air<br>
pressure new effects were generated, namely a slight crossing of the filaments and a<br>
corresponding through-mix effect. In own experiments one could surprisingly determine, that<br>
in case of prior application of lubrication agent on the yarn this got optimally distributed on<br>
the yarn or the individual filaments and the effect of the lubrication agent itself on reduction<br>
of the quantity of the lubricating agent by 5 to 20% became even clearer, as opposed to the<br>
known practice. With this new solution one can achieve a steadier run, stability and an<br>
increase of operational safety. Thus, in many cases, one can save 10 - 20% or more of<br>
lubrication agent. There are several usage possibilities. It could quickly be seen that the<br>
effect of slight crossing does not disturb any of the subsequent treatment stages, e g neither<br>
the stretching nor the generation of a knot-yarn, or thermal effects like relaxation. For use of<br>
the lubrication agent, the new solution fulfils a double function, namely crossing and<br>
optimization of the lubrication agent application and its distribution. As the air flow in yarn<br>
run direction gets a strong conveying effect, not only can the transportation speed of the air be<br>
increased but the effect of the air, in the sense of intensive air whirls can also be increased<br>
without generating knots. Thus, in practice a new element can be made available with very<br>
positive effect, which was not possible till now in this manner, and which allows multiple<br>
usage possibilities. In a vast majority of application cases, air is the optimum blowing<br>
medium. It is however seen, that in special applications even steam can be used as medium,<br>
e.g. for relaxation The new process stage is referred to below as migration stage and the new<br>
air nozzle is referred to as migration nozzle.<br>
In POY- and FOY-/FDY-spinning processes the thread run becomes steadier with an<br>
additional migration stage. One gets a stabilization of the thread on the subsequent deflecting<br>
or drawing rollers, and also due to the uniform distribution of the spinning lubrication<br>
between the filaments and hence also by compensation of thread tension differences.<br>
Depending on the spinning process, this takes place as follows<br>
- In the FOY-/FDY-process the stabilization of the thread on the drawing or deflecting<br>
rollers should take place by means of a uniform distribution of the spinning lubrication in<br>
the thread, as well as a light through-mixing of the filaments (a kind of continuous<br>
intermingling with knot formation). There should not be any intermingling points, as this<br>
would lead to differences in friction during the drawing process on the drawing rollers.<br>
The migration nozzle is situated before the first drawing roller. If one has to intermingle,<br>
then it is done before the spooler with additional air whirling nozzle.<br>
- In the POY process, similarly a stabilization of the thread on the rollers (here: deflecting<br>
rollers) is attempted by means of a uniform distribution of the spinning lubrication between<br>
the filaments; the mounting position is the same.<br>
- In the BCF process, a stabilization of the individual filaments in the yarn and distribution<br>
of the lubrication is generated. In the tricolour process, additionally a slight colour<br>
separation in the yearn is achieved. Mounting position is the same as in the case of the<br>
other processes.<br>
The blowing air current is generated with compressed air which should preferably be less than<br>
6 bar, preferably lesser than 1.5 bar and more preferably between 0.3 bar to 1.2 bar. In case<br>
of finer yarns it has been seen that a pressure of approx. 0.5 bar is optimum. With the help of<br>
the migration nozzle, a new path has been shown for crossing of the filaments, which was not<br>
known before in practice. The technology coming next is intermingling. In intermingling, a<br>
mixing and binding of the individual filaments of a yarn are sought, which in the result can be<br>
identified by visible knots. During migration no knots should be formed, which is achieved<br>
on the one hand by a blowing in angle of greater than 15°, preferably 20 - 60°, particularly<br>
lesser than 45°, and on the other hand with a low pressure of the treatment air. Instead of knot<br>
formation, only a mixing and crossing of the filaments is endeavoured. The air current<br>
directed in yarn run direction has in the yarn channel a sufficiently intensive distribution and<br>
mixing function for the lubrication agent. The lubrication agent gets more uniformly<br>
distributed on the entire yarn due to the whirl flow and the very intensive movement of the<br>
filaments relatively towards one another by means of local centrifugal and frictional<br>
movements of the filaments, and with the help of the quite good binding effect for the<br>
filaments of a yarn gives a noticeably stable thread run, even at the highest transportation<br>
speed of a yarn as known presently. The mentioned jumping was no longer noticed after<br>
using the new solution, so that even the danger of the thread breaking gets significantly<br>
reduced. The treatment in the migration nozzle takes place within the framework of the<br>
spinning process, preferably immediately after lubrication at very high transportation speed of<br>
the yarn<br>
The migration nozzle has a continuous treatment channel which extends in thread run<br>
direction in many application, with a compressed air feeding into the yarn channel directed in<br>
transportation direction, which goes into the yarn channel at an inclination of more than 15° to<br>
the vertical. The migration nozzle is attached at a free distance immediately after a device for<br>
application of lubrication agent. The effective yarn channel length is preferably designed<br>
constantly extended, with the smallest cross-section in the region of yarn feed and largest<br>
cross-section in the region of the yarn removal from the yarn channel of the migration nozzle.<br>
Earlier experiments have shown that good results can be achieved if the ratio between the <br>
inlet cross-section and outlet cross-section is approx. 1:2. The air feeder ends approx at the<br>
end of the first one-third of the treatment channel. Over the length of the yarn channel the<br>
migration nozzle has a threading hole. This is preferably arranged in the upper one-third of<br>
the yarn channel in the separation level between nozzle plate and baffle plate. The migration<br>
nozzle can be designed as single, double or multiple nozzle.<br>
Instead of migration, the same or slightly modified nozzle can be used for relaxation, whereby<br>
steam instead of compressed air would be required. Depending on the application, the nozzle<br>
can be used as closed or open nozzle with threading hole.<br>
It has been recognized by the inventors that a nozzle with binding agent can remain operation-<br>
safe only if the nozzle, pressure, heat, steam or chemical substances are durable With the<br>
glue compounds used so far, not all practical problems could be satisfactorily solved<br>
Furthermore, glue compounds can only be investigated only if the practical conditions are<br>
already known. A glue compound cannot be determined in its composition with respect to<br>
attack from still unknown chemicals which could be used in future, however with additional<br>
heat and humidity effect. In the new solution, the binding agents are preferably arranged in a<br>
common alignment, preferably aligned with the yarn run. Surprisingly, in a corresponding<br>
pin binding it could be determined that contrary to the state-of-the-art technology, in this way<br>
the entire nozzle body can be built much smaller, even in miniature form. Particularly while<br>
using a double nozzle, or several nozzles beside one another, the division between two<br>
adjacent yarn runs can be selected significantly smaller than before. In some application<br>
cases this even has a reactive effect on the galette size With the possibility of the<br>
miniaturization, on one and the same machine size, thanks to the new binding, additional yarn<br>
runs can be foreseen and accordingly the total efficiency of the machine can be increased.<br>
This means that the binding agent previously used in watch technology also brings<br>
unexpected advantages at totally different levels. The strong holding together of the parts can<br>
be ensured by a classical screw binding, as in the state-of-the-art technology. The new<br>
solution is particularly advantageous in the application as intermingling nozzle and as thermal<br>
treatment body and, as will be shown later, as migration nozzle.<br>
In conformity with the known intermingling nozzles, the treatment medium is directed as far<br>
as possible exactly on to the longitudinal central axis of the yarn channel, however at an<br>
inclination greater than 15° in yarn transportation direction In this way, uniform whirls are<br>
generated on both sides, however no knots.<br>

Methods and Design of the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cutout from a yarn treatment stage 1, whereby on the left the chemical<br>
lubrication stage 2 and on the right the migration stage 3 is shown. Yarn 4 comes directly<br>
from a spinning process and is led through a lubrication device, which has a basic body 5 in<br>
which a feed channel for the lubrication agent CH.Pr is guided from below up to the region of<br>
the thread run and ends with the so-called lubrication lips 7. Above the lubrication lips 7, two<br>
U-shaped guide studs 8 are arranged, which lead the yarn 4 sideways over the lubrication lips<br>
7. The basic body 5 ideally has a bulged guide groove 9, in such a way that the thread run is<br>
compulsorily guided in a protective manner over the point of contact of the yarn 4 with the<br>
lubrication agent CH.Pr. The application of the lubrication agent CH.Pr on the yarn 4 takes<br>
place like a move-along effect through loop contact. As the lubrication agent CH.Pr in the<br>
feed channel 6 is under pressure only as long as a sure after-flow is guaranteed, it is not<br>
possible to uniformly network all filaments of the yarn. The result is that the yarn 4 cannot be<br>
homogeneously provided with the lubrication agent over the lubrication lips 7. Depending on<br>
the type of lubrication agent, the applied lubrication agent film partly dries on one side<br>
rapidly, so that the effectivity gets reduced. The inventors have identified that this problem<br>
can be eliminated with the help of a first design, in that the yarn 4 is subjected to a more<br>
intensive air whirl flow shortly after the lubrication, at a distance FA in a migration nozzle 10<br>
A double whirl flow has proved to be optimum, which generates a good through-mixing of<br>
the lubrication agent in the entire yarn bundle and at the same time generates a crossing of the<br>
filaments in the yarn 4'. In doing so, intermingling knots (fig. 6c) should be avoided. The<br>
yarn gets opened by the double whirl flow and slightly crosses the individual filaments<br>
against one another (see fig. 6b).<br>
A migration nozzle 10 is shown on a larger scale in fig. 2a, once again in section. The<br>
migration nozzle 10 is designed two-part and consists of an upper cover plate or pall plate 11<br>
as well as lower nozzle plate 12 with the connection 13 for the treatment medium. From the<br>
connection 13 the medium is fed through a first hole 14 as well as a compressed medium feed<br>
channel 15 into the yarn channel 16. Important thereby is the blow-in direction, which is<br>
denoted by the angle a. The angle a must be greater than 10° to the vertical with respect to<br>
the yarn run into the yarn channel 16. According to earlier experiments the angle a should<br>
even be greater than approx. 15°. Due to the angular range of 15° - 60°, like before, a double<br>
whirl and at the same time also a strong conveying effect is generated in the yarn<br>
transportation direction. As shown in fig. 2a, the mouth of the compressed medium feed<br>
channel 15 lies at the end of approx. the first one-third of the yarn channel 16, as can be seen<br>
from the dimension data X and Y. On the three sections marked by the dimension arrows<br>
(treatment channel beginning A, mouth of the air blow-in B and end of the treatment channel<br>
C) the free cross-section of the yarn channel 16 becomes increasingly greater in yarn<br>
transportation direction. The size of the narrowest cross-section depends on the titre of the<br>
yarn as already known in the case of intermingling nozzles. The surface F3 is approx. twice<br>
as large as F1 depending on the angle, F2 is correspondingly proportional between both<br>
values F1 and F3. Contrary to the lubrication stage 2, in which a chemical lubrication agent<br>
(CH.Pr) is added, the migration stage 3 works with a gas-shaped medium. It could be mere<br>
compressed air, heated air or steam, depending on the kind of desired treatment A free<br>
distance FA between the lubrication device 5 and the migration nozzle 10 is of great<br>
advantage for the subsequent fitting of a migration nozzle in existing plants. The gas-shaped<br>
medium used in the migration nozzle 10 should at least work dominantly in yarn<br>
transportation direction, in such a way that the minimum possible of gas-shaped medium<br>
blows back into the inlet region 20 of the yarn channel 16, which could disturb the application<br>
of the chemical lubrication agent CH.Pr. As already mentioned earlier, for migration<br>
relatively lesser pressure of treatment gas is required, which in many cases of application lies<br>
approx. between 0.3 and 1.5 bar. The baffle surface 21 should preferably be designed as<br>
smooth surface, whereas the opposite side 22 (air blow-in side) is rounded. The channel<br>
width in the region of the nozzle plate KBD should, according to fig 2b, be at least equal to<br>
or greater than the channel width KBP in the baffle plate, so that the individual filaments do<br>
not remain hanging at the protrusions, particularly in the region of the threading hole 22, or no<br>
corresponding disturbances are caused. Fig. 2c shows a single yarn treatment nozzle, fig. 2d<br>
shows a double nozzle. In fig. 2d the division T between two adjacent yarn runs are shown.<br>
In many cases it is possible to provide instead of only a single compressed medium feed<br>
channel 15, two or more channels, which work appropriately.<br>
Figs. 3a and 3b show a two-part migration nozzle 10 as section of the fig. 3c. Fig. 3a is a<br>
section IIIa - IIIa of fig. 3c, fig. 3b is a section IIIb - IIIb of the fig. 3c. Fig. 3c is a section III<br>
- III of the fig. 3a. The migration nozzle 10 consists of a nozzle plate 11 and a cover plate 12.<br>
Both parts can be solidly fixed by a screw 32 (fig 3b). For the exact positioning, especially<br>
as mounting aids, the nozzle plate 10 and the cover plate 12 are secured by two aligning pins<br>
33, 33' against displacement in a level (shown in fig. 3b by X - X) according to the arrow 34.<br>
The shown aligning pins 33, 33' have a double function in the shown example. Apart from<br>
positioning of nozzle plate and cover plate with respect to one another, they also serve the<br>
purpose of local fixing of the entire migration nozzle 10 to the holding frame 35 which is not<br>
shown. The aligning pins 33, 33' are already mounted by the manufacturer in one of the<br>
nozzle parts. Important thereby is that the supporting is not done on a glue joint, welding<br>
joint or soldering joint, but the mechanical clamping agents give an anchoring into the<br>
material of the air treatment body. A clamping spring or clamping ring 36 represent the<br>
mechanical clamping agents. For the clamping ring 36, a relief somewhat similar in shape to<br>
the clamping agent is provided in connection with a conical recess in the nozzle plate 11 A<br>
lead-in cone makes the automatic mounting of the aligning pins easier The nozzle plate 11<br>
has two alignment holes. The aligning pin can also be manually inserted into a through-hole<br>
37 which is shown dashed line, till the clamping ring 36 comes to the end position of the lead-<br>
in cone. The remaining movement for inserting the aligning pin 33 can be done with a light<br>
impact, e.g. by a rubber hammer, so that the clamping spring 36 jumps into the relief In the<br>
finally mounted condition, the aligning pin 33 protrudes on both sides. The counter-piece to<br>
the nozzle plate 11 is the cover plate 12, which correspondingly has two axis-parallel pin-<br>
holes at an identical distance. The mounting of both parts 11, 12 already takes place at the<br>
manufacturer's place. In the application operation, for cleaning the parts, after loosening the<br>
screw 32, the parts can be removed from one another in the axis direction of the aligning pins.<br>
A further great advantage of the suggested solution is, that later recycling is improved due to<br>
the easy separability of the parts and each material can be separately processed. This is<br>
important also because the yarn treatment nozzles are wear- and-tear parts.<br>
Figs. 3a and 3c show a possible shape of yarn channel 16 for treatment of yarn with<br>
compressed air or steam The position for a medium connector is marked by DL, whereby the<br>
medium, e.g. with 1 to 10 bar is introduced into the yarn channel 16 through a feed hole 15.<br>
Ideally, both the aligning pins 33, 33' are arranged on a common horizontal line 37 (VE)<br>
along with the screw 32. In this way the aligning joint as well as the force connection is<br>
optimum and allows a particularly close division for the yarn run.<br>
Both the basic bodies of the migration nozzles are made of highly wear-resistant and very<br>
costly material, especially ceramic. The holes or seats for the clamping agents can be<br>
manufactured standardized or automated with respect to the diameters and diameter ratios.<br>
The aligning pins, on the other hand, can be fabricated in different lengths for the respective<br>
application as reasonably priced decoltage parts.<br>
Figs. 2b, 2c and 2c as well as 3 a to 3 c are also examples for thermal treatment in one or two<br>
through-run chambers, particularly for treatment of yarn with hot steam or hot air without<br>
immediate prior lubrication. Each through-run chamber has a yarn inlet 38, a yarn outlet 39<br>
and in the centre region a medium feeding opening 5. If the medium is hot steam, for very<br>
high yarn transportation speeds today one gets as disadvantage with yarn which has been<br>
treated priorly with lubrication agents at some point of time, extremely aggressive conditions.<br>
Particularly interesting in the example shown is, that both the through-run chambers or steam<br>
chambers have a significantly large length measurement which is conditioned by the working<br>
process, or has to be determined from case to case As one can see from fig 2b, 2c and 2d,<br>
the yarn treatment body has not only one but two or more through-run chambers. With the<br>
new design of the binding agents, both the chambers can be built particularly close to one<br>
another. If several parallel yarn runs are required, then this is particularly advantageous,<br>
because in this way the division T between two adjacent yarn runs can be selected extremely<br>
small. The aligning pin joint and screw joint is preferably attached on a line 37 parallel to the<br>
yarn run and is resistant to lubrication agents. The medium fed through the feed opening 15<br>
can leave the through-run chamber through the yarn inlet 38 or the yarn outlet 39. If only one<br>
single treatment position is in use, the medium quantity is still small and can flow away into<br>
the room. However, if many steam positions are used in the same room, then particularly in<br>
case of hot steam, it should be collected out of the through-run chamber and removed.<br>
Ideally, one or more positions should be surrounded by a common medium collecting<br>
housing. In case of thermal treatment, a radiation effect must be avoided. Steam feeding can<br>
also be done through several holes. It is important to avoid a strong radiation effect by the<br>
thermal medium in case of thermal treatment, whether it is hot air, hot steam or any hot<br>
medium mixture, which, for example, could also contain lubrication agents. Figs. 4a and 4b<br>
show an example each for different extension angle (3 of the yarn channel. Fig. 4a shows a<br>
larger angle ß2 with 5-10°. Fig. 4b shows an angle less than 6°.<br>
In fig 5a, the possibility of a yarn channel with constant cross-section is shown by two short<br>
parallel dashes Fig. 5a to 5c show the basic possibility in a migration nozzle of adding<br>
lubrication agent CH Pr through a feed channel. The lubrication agent CH.Pr is fed directly<br>
into the yarn channel 16 through a fine hole 40. At the entry point, the lubrication agent can<br>
be applied directly on the running yarn by wiping, as in the case of the lubrication lips. As<br>
there is an enormous variety of different lubrication agents, even with respect to consistency,<br>
the special lubrication agent application has to be adapted in special cases. A further<br>
possibility is shown in fig. 5c. Here the lubrication agent is fed into the yarn channel 16<br>
through the hole 40 in the compressed medium feed channel 15 As in the case of application<br>
of steam as treatment medium, it could also become necessary in the solution as shown in<br>
figs. 5a - 5c to suction off the exiting air. For an optimum mixing and application of the<br>
lubrication agent, one or more pouches 41 can be arranged in the region of the holes<br>
Fig. 6a shows a strong enlargement of a plain yarn 4, whereby the individual filaments run<br>
almost parallel in the thread. The parallel bundling of the filaments has the great<br>
disadvantage, in that firstly the thread bundle is very loose and secondly the individual<br>
filaments can break away from the bundle very easily and could pose problems during<br>
processing. Fig. 6c shows as counter-piece a knot-yarn, which was produced in a classical<br>
intermingling nozzle. One can see above and below one knot respectively, whereby L is a<br>
left-twist knot and R a right-twist knot. The knot binding is relatively stable; however, the<br>
knot-yarn can again get released by strong and multiple tuggings on a piece Knot formation<br>
pre-requires a filament yarn. If the yarn already has half or weak knots, the actual knot<br>
formation becomes more difficult and bad in an intermingling nozzle. The yarn sample<br>
between the knot yarn (fig. 6c) and plain yarn (fig. 6a) is the new crossed yarn (fig 6b). The<br>
individual filaments are lightly crossed against one another or, in other words, continuously<br>
mixed in the other constallation The crossing gives a sufficient holding together so that in<br>
the immediately subsequent processing the bundle cannot get loose, especially individual<br>
filaments can no longer get removed from the bundle. The crossed yarn gives the subsequent<br>
processing precisely the required safety for transportation or spooling or the particular<br>
treatment stages which will be explained below<br>
Fig. 7a schematically shows from top to bottom a spinning line for POY, fig. 7b for<br>
FDY/FOY as spin drawing line and fig. 7c the application for a spinning drawing texturising<br>
line BCF-yarn, which has spinning 50, a migration stage 51, a drawing stage 52, a texturising<br>
stage 53 and an intermingling 54 and finally a spooling 55. In fig. 7a the stage stretching and<br>
texturising are missing and in fig. 7 only texturising is missing as compared to fig. 7c.<br>
Figs 8a and 8b as well as 9a to 9c show usages of a migration stage 51 in different spinning<br>
processes, whereby 50 denotes a so-called spin beam with subsequent spinning shaft as well<br>
as the blowing, 2 denotes the lubrication stage and 60 denotes an automatic yarn cutting<br>
device. Before the winding stage, the intermingling is denoted by 54. 3 is the migration stage<br>
the 55 is the winding stage. In figs. 8a and 8b DrTw denotes "Draw Twisting" and DRW<br>
denotes "Draw Winding", which follows subsequently. Figs. 8a and 8b stand for POY-yarn,<br>
whereas figs. 9a to 9c indicate an application for FDY-yarn Points at which heat is<br>
introduced are marked with HEAT<br>
Fig. 10a shows a process of technical yarn and fig. 10b shows a BCF-process.<br>
The reference numerical 60 is put in brackets in figs. 8a, 8b, 9a - 9c, 10a, 10b With this it<br>
becomes clear that the concrete use of the migration nozzle alone or a combination with a<br>
lubrication stage or as a third possibility, the use of a combined nozzle is possible as shown in<br>
figs. 5a and 5c.<br>
For the design, shapes of cross-section etc. one could refer to the possibilities given in EP-P<br>
PS 564 400, EP-PS 465 405 or US-PS 5 010 631.<br>
