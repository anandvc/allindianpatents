3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be  performed : -<br><br>
The invention concerns a drawing system of a spinning preparation machine according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
A variety of spinning preparation machines with a drawing system are known from the prior art, with cards, drawing frames and combing machines calling for particular mention. A drawing frame of the applicant is, for instance, known from DE 195 48 840 Al, in which the operative approaches the drawing system from the side and swings the loading arm with the upper rollers that are suspended in it about a swivelling axis that follows the drawing system in order to gain access to the drawing region. From the point of view of the operative, the loading arm pivots from left to right, which is to say past the operative's body.<br>
There is also known a drawing frame in which the operative again approaches the drawing system from the side, but then, however, pivots the loading arm upwards. In this case the swivelling axis is aligned along the length of the drawing system, on the side away from the operative.<br>
An operating scheme has, furthermore, become known in which the operative approaches the drawing system from the front in order to pivot the loading arm upwards. The last type of machine in particular, however, is not easy to operate by, for instance, relatively small persons.<br>
It is the purpose of the present invention to further develop a drawing system of the type mentioned at the beginning in such a way that operation is made easier.<br>
This task is fulfilled for a drawing system of the type mentioned at the beginning through the features of Claim 1. A spinning preparation machine incorporating a drawing system of this type is also included in the invention.<br>
The development according to the invention offers the particular advantage that the loading arm, as in the earlier machines of the applicant, is constructed so that it can<br>
-2-<br><br>
pivot forwards, i.e. in the direction in which the fibre sliver is moving, but at the same time that operation is simplified in that the operative approaches the drawing system from the front, i.e. from the discharge end of the drawing system, which is to say opposite to the direction in which the fibre sliver or slivers are moving. Access to the drawing system, where the operative stands facing the drawing system, is made easy because the operative can reach around the loading arm with both arms in order to access the drawing rollers or the fibre sliver or slivers that are in the drawing system.<br>
This advantage is particularly helpful if the drawing system is tilted towards the operative, so that the loading arm, or the pressure arms, are positioned, when open, in the region of the breast or middle body of the operative. As a result, the drawing rollers are in full view, so that the maximum degree of hand-eye coordination is assured.<br>
Because of the height of the cans into which the drawn fibre sliver is usually placed, it is advantageous to position a pedestal at the operative's position, i.e. at the discharge end of the drawing system. To gain access, the operative stands on the pedestal - which may have steps - to get improved access to the drawing system, particularly when it is opened.<br>
It has been found to be favourable if the drawing system is tilted above the horizontal at an angle a in the range between 10° and 80°, preferably between 40° and 75°, and most preferably by about 60°. An inclined arrangement of the drawing rollers of this type provides good accessibility to all the necessary operating elements for the purpose, for instance, of inserting fibre sliver into the drawing system. The operative here carries out his work around both sides of the loading arm.<br>
Together with the tilt of the drawing system, it has been found favourable if - when the loading arm is open as far as possible - the angle β between the inclination of<br>
-3-<br><br>
the drawing system and the loading arm lies in the range between 70° and 120°. Favourably, this angle p lies in the range between 80° and 100°, and most favourably is approximately 90°. In particular if the drawing system is tilted by about 60° (a) to the horizontal it is extremely easy to work on the drawing system when the loading arm is open. The operative looks down at an angle onto the lower rollers and the transport path of the fibre sliver or slivers, and can reach around the loading arm with both of his arms. With this arrangement, there is neither any obstruction to the view, nor are there any obstacles in the region where the operative's arms and hands will move.<br>
It is, correspondingly, favourable if the angle y between the loading arm when it is swung out and the horizontal lies in the range between 10° and 60°, preferably between 25° and 45°, and most favourably is approximately 30°. If the drawing system is inclined at an angle of about 60° through having selected an angle of 30°, the drawing region becomes exceptionally accessible; the angle p Dis about 90° in this case.<br>
A length for the loading arm adapted to the arm length of an operative of average size, who can for that matter also be relatively small, measured from its swivelling axis to its free end, is favourably in the range between 30 cm and 45 cm, preferably in the range between 33 cm and 39 cm. A length of about 36 cm is particularly favourable.<br>
Good accessibility to important features at the outlet of the drawing system, particularly to a compressing unit that is located after the drawing rollers and whose purpose is to compress the drawn card web into a fibre sliver, can favourably be achieved if the distance between the free end of the loading arm and this compressing unit lies in the range between 40 cm and 55 cm. The distance lies favourably in the range between 43 cm and 49 cm, and is preferably approximately 46 cm.<br>
-4-<br><br>
The width of the loading arm is favourably also adapted in such a way that the operative can reach around it on both sides whilst maintaining a relaxed posture. It has been found favourable here if the width of the loading arm lies in the range between 24 cm and 40 cm, and favourably is in the range from 26 cm to 34 cm. A width of about 28 cm is preferable.<br>
The drawing system according to the invention can be implemented particularly simply if it incorporates a carrier fabricated primarily from two cut side braces and a rib that joins the two braces. The side braces and the rib here are favourably cut from metal plate using a laser. It has, surprisingly been found that the cut edges of the side braces do not require mechanical rework, even if the bearings for the lower rollers of the drawing system and, when present, of a following calender roller, are located directly on the cut edges. In this case the bearings can be directly bolted to the side braces.<br>
It is, furthermore, favourable if openings for the main drive shaft and/or the countershaft are cut into the side braces. This very compact structure for the carrier for the bearings of the lower rollers, a calender roller and one or more drive shafts allows the drawing system to have an extremely compact structure, again enabling the swivelling loading arm to be kept very short. As a consequence, the swivelling axis can be located relatively close in front of the operative; reaching round the loading arm to access the area of the drawing system is therefore quite possible. This is also true for smaller persons having correspondingly short arms. A drawing system optimized in this way therefore makes it possible to work with exceptional freedom of operation in a very small space.<br>
The spinning preparation machine according to the invention incorporating the drawing system described above features, in a favourable embodiment, a can ejection device in which the direction of ejection for the filled can is substantially parallel to the swivel axis of the loading arm. This implementation offers the significant advantage that the operative is not standing in the can exchange area as they work in the area of the drawing system. As a consequence, access to the<br>
-5-<br><br>
drawing system is made easier in that, for instance, fewer machine parts, or even none at all, must be crossed in order to reach the drawing system.<br>
Favourable further developments of the invention are indicated by the features of the subsidiary claims.<br>
The invention is explained in more detail with the aid of the figures below. They show:<br>

In Figures 1 and 2 a schematic side view of the important parts of a drawing frame is shown as an example of a spinning preparation machine. The heart of the drawing frame is the drawing system 1, in which one or more fibre slivers FB preceding the<br>
-6-<br><br>
drawing system 1 are drafted in the familiar way. The fibre sliver or slivers FB pass through the drawing system 1 in the direction f3 (see Figure 1). As a result, the output of the drawing system 1 provides a single, relatively consistent, fibre sliver FB that is drawn by a pair of calender rollers 38, 48, out of the drawing system 1 through a schematically indicated compressing unit 70, comprising in particular a fleece funnel with a subsequent fleece nozzle, and passed through a usually curved band channel 71 that is integrated into a turntable 72, and placed into a can K. The turntable 72, and therefore the band channel 71, rotates about a vertical axis indicated by a dotted line. The can K is also rotated by being placed on a rotating can table 73. The two vertical rotary axes of the can plate 73 and the turntable 72 turn, in the conventional way, in opposite directions, so that the fibre sliver FB is placed into the can K in a cycloidal pattern.<br>
The can K stands in an opening in the lower structure 2, which also supports the drawing system 1. A pedestal 3, on which the operative B can stand, is positioned in front of the lower structure 2.<br>
In order to draw the fibre sliver FB, the drawing system 1 comprises three pairs of rollers. These consist first of all of the inlet roller pair, comprising the lower inlet roller 35 and the upper inlet roller 45. Following the direction of movement f3 of the fibre sliver or fibre slivers FB, there follow the lower middle roller 36 and the upper middle roller 46. Between them, the rollers 35, 45, 36 and 46 comprise the preliminary drawing region. The last pair of rollers in the drawing system 1 consists of the lower outlet roller 37 and the upper outlet roller 47, which, together with the middle rollers 36 and 46, comprise the main drawing region. The roller pairs mentioned above run with different circumferential speeds, so that the fibre sliver or slivers FB that are spread out as a fibrous web in the drawing system 1 and clamped along the nip line of each pair of rollers are drafted according to the ratio of the circumferential speeds.<br>
-7-<br><br>
The lower rollers 35, 36 and 37 are carried at their ends in bearings 31, 32 or 33 which are positioned - as will be explained in further detail with reference to Figures 4 to 6 - on a carrier 5. The upper rollers 45, 46 and 47 are supported on a loading arm 50 with two side cheeks 52a and 52b, whose free ends are joined by means of a horizontal bar 54 and which are each held at the other end in a pivot bearing 58. By means of this linkage, the loading arm 50 can be swung around the swivelling axis 59, see arrow f2.<br>
In order to achieve optimal clamping of the fibre sliver or slivers FB in the drawing system 1, the loading arm 50, and the upper rollers 45, 46 and 47 that are suspended from it are locked in the loading position shown in Figure 1 by means of two pivoted levers 75. The claws at the ends of the pivoted levers 75 grip the horizontal bar 54 of the loading arm 50. When the swivelling arm 75 is swung up around the swivelling axis 76 (see arrow fl), the loading arm 50 becomes free and can be swung up around the swivelling axis 59. This situation is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
The upper rollers 45, 46 and 47 are pressed by loaded rams 41, 42 and 43 into the receptacles 66 (same reference number) of the bearings 31, 32 and 33. The pressure can be applied pneumatically or by means of springs, the latter being suggested by the zigzag line 51.<br>
The drawing system 1 shown in the figures is what is known as a 3-over-3 drawing system, inclined at an angle a of about 45° above the horizontal in front of the operative B. As can further be seen in Figure 2, the loading arm 50 can be swung up through an angle β of about 90°. As a further consequence, the loading arm 50 adopts an angle y of about 45° to the horizontal when its pivoted position. The three angles are shown on Figure 2 both directly in relation to the machine parts, and also schematically in a small, separate diagram above the drawing system 1.<br>
It should be noted that Figures 1 and 2 only show the mechanical components of the drawing frame. The control units, central computer, drives and the like are not<br>
-8-<br><br>
shown as they are not relevant to the context of the present invention; favourably they correspond to those of known implementations. Drives that transfer the power by belt, individual drives and mixed configurations are possible here.<br>
As can be seen from Figures 1 and 2, an operative B of the drawing system 1 approaches the drawing frame from the front, by initially standing on the pedestal 3 in order to work at an optimum height. The drawing system 1 is then positioned in front of the chest and middle body of the operative B, i.e. facing the operative. In order to be able to manipulate the fibre sliver or slivers FB in the drawing system 1 -for instance in order to insert the ends of slivers that require drawing, or in order to clean the drawing system 1 - the operative unlocks the loading arm 50, so that he can then swing it towards himself. In the view shown on Figure 3, the opened drawing system 1 is illustrated again to provide a better overview. A number of distances and lengths in the region of the working area are also quoted on Figure 3. The loading arm 50 has a width, c, of about 28 cm; its length, a, measured from the swivelling axis 59 out to its free end, is about 37 cm in the present case. The distance, b, from the compressing unit 70 to the aforementioned free end of the loading arm 50 is, in the present case, about 46 cm. It should be noted that the view from above given in Figure 3 shows the loading arm in perspective.<br>
It is clear from Figures 2 and 3 that the operative B reaches to both sides of the loading arm 50 in order to be able to manipulate the drawing system 1 or the fibre sliver or slivers FB. Because the free end of the loading arm 50 is at rest in front of his chest, the operative B has a free view of the drawing system 1 over and across the loading arm 50. The ability to work favourably is supported by the inclined arrangement of the drawing system 1 (angle a), the angles β and y, and by the geometrical dimensions and spacings a, b, c. The pedestal 3 also provides a favourable working height for the operative. The pedestal 3 can be omitted if the cans K are lower.<br>
The scheme, according to the invention, of facilitating work on the drawing system 1 from the front, together with the swivelling axis 59 of the loading arm 50 that follows<br>
-9-<br><br>
the drawing system 1, is explained in more detail below with the aid of Figures 4 to 6; a favourable embodiment of the invention is referred to in the discussion.<br>
In Figure 4, the drawing system 1 is shown from the opposite side to Figures 1 and 2. It consists of a carrier 5, substantially consisting of two side braces 10a and 10b, parallel to one another, and joined together by the rib 20. Whereas both of the side braces 10a, 10b extend in a vertical plane, the rib 20 is curved, and has several plane sections. The rib 20 is shown on Figure 2 as a dotted line; the fold lines 21, 22 and 23 are also shown.<br>
The rib 20 has - as can particularly seen in the front view of Figure 5 and the view from above of Figure 6 - an opening 27 in the centre extending from the loading arm 50, delimited at the bottom by the lower plate 2 and from above by a section 25 of the rib 20. This opening 27 is used to remove fibres from the area of the drawing system (see arrow f5), in order to keep it clean. The vacuum equipment required for this, and the other vacuum channels in front of and behind the opening 27 are not displayed.<br>
It has been found to be particularly favourable to cut the side braces 10a, 10b and the rib 20 out of metal plate using a laser. The advantage of this procedure is that the braces 10a, 10b and the rib 20 can be made quickly and precisely.<br>
The process of laser cutting mentioned above has been found, further, to be highly advantageous because the cut edges 11 do not require rework in order to be able to accurately accept and position the bearings 31-34. This discovery has led to a further simplification of the manufacturing process of the drawing system 1 according to the invention.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 8, the specification of the cutting direction means that the cut edges 11 slope slightly inwards. The laser beam is applied from the inner side of the side brace 10b, which is from the left-hand side as shown in Figure 8. The<br>
-10-<br><br>
bearing 32 (taken here as an example) is located essentially at the highest part of the cut edge 11. The cut edge 11 on the opposite side brace 10a is also created by cutting the plate from the inside of the side brace 10a, so that the two cut edges exhibit mirror symmetry.<br>
It has been found that the bearings 31-34 can be positioned with great precision in spite of the inclination of the cut edge.<br>
The side braces 10a, 10b furthermore incorporate three slots 12, 13, parallel to one another but offset (see Figure 7); these are used for locking the bearings 31, 32 and 33 for the lower rollers 35, 36 and 37. As can be seen particularly in Figure 8, the bearings 31, 32 and 33 have an L-shape on the underneath, and therefore, when in position, lie on the inner side of the side braces 10a, 10b, and, on the other side, on the cut edge 11 itself. Figure 8 shows, for instance, the attachment and fastening of bearing 32 on side brace 10b - which favourably is not thicker than 18 mm and is preferably not thicker than 12 mm.<br>
The long shoulders of the L-shape of the bearings 31, 32 and 33 each have a pair of parallel, internally threaded holes 67 that correspond to the slots 12,13, and through which bolts 80 are inserted from the outside of the side braces 10a, 10b. Between each bolt 80 and the side brace 10a or 10b there is a compression plate 81, see Figure 8. The two bolts for each bearing 31, 32 and 33 serve to secure against tilting. When the bolts 80 are loosened, the corresponding bearing 31, 32 or 33 can be slid along the slots 12, 13 and locked in place after positioning, for the purpose of changing the preliminary drawing and/or main drawing distance (i.e. the distance between the nip lines of the corresponding pairs of rollers).<br>
In order to support the ends of the respective lower rollers 35, 36 and 37, each of the bearings 31, 32 and 33 has a through-hole 65 (same reference number). In addition there is in each case a receptacle 66 for the ends of each of the associated upper rollers 45, 46 and 47.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The side braces 10a, 10b also each have a slot 14 along which a bearing 34 for supporting the calender roller 38 can be pushed. Like the bearings 31, 32 and 33 mentioned above, the bearing 34 also has holes for locking bolts, a through-hole 69 to accept the end of the calender roller 38, and a recess 68 opening upwards to accept the end of the other calender roller 48.<br>
As can particularly seen in figures 4 and 7, the laser is also used to make cuts in the two side braces 10a, 10b. A circular opening 17 is first cut by the laser in the side braces 10a, 10b in which the main drive shaft (not shown) for the lower drawing rollers 35, 36 and 37 has its bearing. Starting from the opening 18, a further straight cut 18 is made to a circular opening 19 that is used for the bearing for the countershaft (not illustrated).<br>
The carrier 5 is preferably fastened to a lower plate 7, and it is advantageous to do this by welding. The lower plate 7 is itself fastened to the lower structure 2 (see Figure 1), for instance by bolting it. To provide a bearing for the turntable 72, the lower plate 7 has a circular opening 9, as can be seen in Figure 6.<br>
It is particularly favourable if the side braces 10a, 10b and the rib 20 are joined using a laser. This is done by clamping the three parts in a jig and aligning them to one another. Figure 7 illustrates how, by means of the jig (not displayed), forces can be applied in the direction of the pairs of arrows f8, f8' and f9, f9', where the side braces 10a, 10b have parallel clamping faces opposite one another for this purpose. It can be seen from Figure 5, that opposing forces are exerted also in the directions f7, f7' on the side braces 10a, 10b. The laser welding process begins after the side braces 10a, 10b and the rib 20 have been accurately aligned in the jig.<br>
The spinning preparation machine according to the invention with the drawing system 1 according to the invention is constructed, as shown in Figure 3, in such a way that the can ejection device (see arrow f4) used to eject a filled can K runs<br>
-12-<br><br>
parallel to the swivelling axis 59 of the loading arm 50. This provides easy access to the drawing system 1 for the operative B without there being a can K in the region where the operative moves, or its transport equipment being an obstacle.<br>
The drawing system 1 according to the invention, and the associated spinning preparation machine, allow easy operation and a clear view of the region of the drawing rollers.<br>
The invention is not restricted to the illustrated implementation. Further modifications within the framework of the patent claims are also part of the invention. The angle of inclination a of 45° in particular is only quoted for the sake of an example. An angle of inclination a of about 60° has also been found to be highly advantageous. In an embodiment that is favourable in this respect, the angle y is approximately 90°, and the angle D approximately 45°. In association with the spacings and lengths a, b, c mentioned above, a drawing system is provided that is particularly convenient to operate.
