BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to the noninvasive measurement of biological<br>
parameters through near-infrared spectroscopy. In particular, an apparatus and a<br>
method are disclosed for noninvasively, and continuously or semi-continuously,<br>
monitoring a biological parameter, such as glucose in tissue.<br>
DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
DIABETES<br>
Diabetes is a chronic disease that results in improper production and use of insulin, a<br>
hormone that facilitates glucose uptake into ceils. Diabetes can be broadly<br>
categorized<br><br>
into four forms: diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, normal physiology, and<br>
hyperinsulinemia (hypoglycemia). While a precise cause of diabetes is unknown,<br>
genetic factors, environmental factors, and obesity appear to play roles. Diabetics<br>
have increased risk in three broad categories: cardiovascular heart disease,<br>
retinopathy, and neuropathy. Diabetics may have one or more of the following<br>
complications: heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, kidney disease,<br>
neuropathy (nerve disease and amputations), retinopathy, diabetic ketoacidosis, skin<br>
conditions, gum disease, impotence, and fetal complications. Diabetes is a leading<br>
cause of death and disability worldwide.<br>
DIABETES PREVALENCE AND TRENDS<br>
Diabetes is a common and growing disease. The World Health Organization (WHO)<br>
estimates that diabetes currently afflicts one hundred fifty-four million people<br>
worldwide. Fifty-four million diabetics live in developed countries. The WHO<br>
estimates that the number of people with diabetes will grow to three hundred million<br>
by the year 2025. In the United States, 15.7 million people or 5.9% of the population<br>
are estimated to have diabetes. Within the United States, the prevalence of adults<br>
diagnosed with diabetes increased by six percent in 1999 and rose by thirty-three<br>
percent between 1990 and 1998. This corresponds to approximately eight hundred<br>
thousand new cases every year in America. The estimated total cost to the United<br>
States economy alone exceeds $90 billion per year (Diabetes Statistics. Bethesda,<br>
MD: National Institute of Health, Publication No. 98-3926, Nov. 1997).<br><br>
Long-term clinical studies show that the onset of diabetes related complications can<br>
be significantly reduced through proper control of blood glucose concentrations (The<br>
Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group. The effect of intensive<br>
treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-term<br>
complications in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. N Eng J of Med<br>
1993;329:977-86; U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) Group, "Intensive<br>
blood-glucose control with sulphonylureas or insulin compared with conventional<br>
treatment and risk of complications in patients with type 2 diabetes," Lancet, vol.<br>
352. pp. 837-853. 1998: Ohkubo, Y., H. Kishikawa, E. Araki, T. Miyata, S. Isami, S.<br>
Motoyoshi, Y. Kojima, N. Furuyoshi, and M. Shichizi, "Intensive insulin therapy<br>
prevents the progression of diabetic microvascular complications in Japanese<br>
patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: a randomized prospective 6-<br>
year study," Diabetes Res Clin Pract. vol. 28, pp. 103-117, 1995). A vital element of<br>
diabetes management is the self-monitoring of blood glucose levels by diabetics in<br>
the home environment. However, current monitoring techniques discourage regular<br>
use due to the inconvenient and painful nature of drawing blood through the skin<br>
prior to analysis (The Diabetes Control and Complication Trial Research Group, "The<br>
effect of intensive treatment of diabetes on the development and progression of long-<br>
term complications of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus", N. Engl. J. Med., 329,<br>
1993, 997-1036). Unfortunately, recent reports indicate that even periodic<br>
measurement of glucose by individuals with diabetes, (e.g. seven times per day) is<br>
insufficient to detect important glucose fluctuations and properly manage the<br>
disease. In addition, nocturnal monitoring of glucose levels is of significant value but<br>
is difficult to perform due to the state of existing technology. Therefore, a device that<br>
provides noninvasive, automatic, and nearly continuous measurements of glucose<br>
levels would be of substantial value to people with diabetes. Implantable glucose<br><br>
analyzers eventually coupled to an insulin delivery system providing an artificial<br>
pancreas are also being pursued.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED TECHNOLOGY<br>
Common technologies are used to analyze the blood glucose concentration of<br>
samples collected by venous draw and with capillary stick approaches. Glucose<br>
analysis includes techniques such as colorimetric and enzymatic glucose analysis.<br>
Many of the invasive, traditional invasive, alternative invasive, and minimally invasive<br>
glucose analyzers use these technologies. The most common enzymatic based<br>
glucose analyzers use glucose oxidase, which catalyzes the reaction of glucose with<br>
oxygen to form gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide, equation 1. Glucose<br>
determination may be achieved by techniques based upon depletion of oxygen in the<br>
sample, through the changes in sample pH, or via the formation of hydrogen<br>
peroxide. A number of colorimetric and electro-enzymatic techniques further use the<br>
reaction products as a starting reagent. For example, hydrogen peroxide reacts in<br>
the presence of platinum to form the hydrogen ion, oxygen, and current any of which<br>
may be used to determine the glucose concentration, equation 2.<br>
glucose + O2 → gluconolactone + H2O2	eq. 1<br>
H2O2→2H+ + O2 + 2e.	eq. 2<br><br>
Due to the wide and somewhat loose terminology in the field, the terms traditional<br>
invasive, alternative invasive, noninvasive, and implantable are here outlined:<br>
Traditional Invasive Glucose Determination<br>
There are three major categories of traditional (classic) invasive glucose<br>
determinations. The first two methodologies use blood drawn with a needle from an<br>
artery or vein, respectively. The third group consists of capillary blood obtained via<br>
lancet from the fingertip or toes. Over the past two decades, this last method has<br>
become the most common method for self-monitoring of blood glucose at home, at<br>
work, or in public settings.<br>
Alternative Invasive Glucose Determination<br>
There are several alternative invasive methods of determining glucose<br>
concentrations.<br>
A first group of alternative invasive glucose analyzers have a number of similarities<br>
to traditional invasive glucose analyzers. One similarity is that blood samples are<br>
acquired with a lancet. Obviously, this form of alternative invasive glucose<br>
determination may not be used to collect venous or arterial blood for analysis, but<br>
may be used to collect capillary blood samples. A second similarity is that the blood<br>
sample is analyzed using chemical analyses that are similar to the colorimetric and<br>
enzymatic analyses describe above. The primary difference is that in an alternative<br>
invasive glucose determination the blood sample is not collected from the fingertip or<br>
toes. For example, according to package labeling the TheraSense® Freestyle<br><br>
Meter™ may be used to collect and analyze blood from the forearm. This is an<br>
alternative invasive glucose determination due to the location of the lancet draw.<br>
In this first group of alternative invasive methods based upon blood draws with a<br>
lancet, a primary difference between the alternative invasive and traditional invasive<br>
glucose determination is the location of blood acquisition from the body. Additional<br>
differences include factors such as the gauge of the lancet, the depth of penetration<br>
of the lancet, timing issues, the volume of blood acquired, and environmental factors<br>
such as the partial pressure of oxygen, altitude, and temperature. This form of<br>
alternative invasive glucose determination includes samples collected from the<br>
palmar region, base of thumb, forearm, upper arm, head, earlobe, torso, abdominal<br>
region, thigh, calf, and plantar region.<br>
A seond group of alternative invasive glucose analyzers are distinguished by their<br>
mode of sample acquisition. This group of glucose analyzers has a common<br>
characteristic of acquiring a biological sample from the body or modifying the surface<br>
of the skin to gather a sample without use of a lancet for subsequent analysis. For<br>
example, a laser poration based glucose analyzer would use a burst or stream of<br>
photons to create a small hole in the surface of the skin. A sample of basically<br>
interstitial fluid would collect in the resulting hole. Subsequent analysis of the<br>
sample for glucose would constitute an alternative invasive glucose analysis whether<br>
or not the sample was actually removed from the created hole. A second common<br>
characteristic is that a device and algorithm are used to determine glucose from the<br>
sample.<br><br>
A number of methodologies exist for the collection of the sample for alternative<br>
invasive measurements including laser poration, applied current, and suction. The<br>
most common are summarized here:<br>
A.	Laser poration: In these systems, photons of one or more wavelengths are<br>
applied to skin creating a small hole in the skin barrier. This allows small<br>
volumes of interstitial fluid to become available to a number of sampling<br>
techniques.<br>
B.	Applied current: In these systems, a small electrical current is applied to the skin<br>
allowing interstitial fluid to permeate through the skin.<br>
C.	Suction: In these systems, a partial vacuum is applied to a local area on the<br>
surface of the skin. Interstitial fluid permeates the skin and is collected.<br>
For example, a device that acquires a sample via iontophoresis, such as Cygnus<br>
GlucoWatch™, is an alternative invasive technique.<br>
In all of these techniques, the analyzed sample is interstitial fluid. However, some of<br>
the techniques can be applied to the skin in a fashion that draws blood. Herein, the<br>
term alternative invasive includes techniques that analyze biosamples such as<br>
interstitial fluid, whole blood, mixtures of interstitial fluid and whole blood, and<br>
selectively sampled interstitial fluid. An example of selectively sampled interstitial<br>
fluid is collected fluid in which large or less mobile constituents are not fully<br>
represented in the resulting sample. For this group of alternative invasive glucose<br>
analyzers sampling sites include: the hand, fingertips, palmar region, base of thumb,<br>
forearm, upper arm, head, earlobe, eye, chest, torso, abdominal region, thigh, calf,<br>
foot, plantar region, and toes, in this document, any technique that draws<br><br>
biosampies from the skin without the use of a lancet on the fingertip or toes is<br>
referred to as an alternative invasive technique.<br>
In addition, it is recognized that the alternative invasive systems each have different<br>
sampling approaches that lead to different subsets of the interstitial fluid being<br>
collected. For example, large proteins might lag behind in the skin while smaller,<br>
more diffusive, elements may be preferentially sampled. This leads to samples<br>
being collected with varying analyte and interferent concentrations. Another<br>
example is that a mixture of whole blood and interstitial fluid may be collected.<br>
Another example is that a laser poration method can result in blood droplets. These<br>
techniques may be used in combination. For example the Soft-Tact, SoftSense in<br>
Europe, applies a suction to the skin followed by a lancet stick. Despite the<br>
differences in sampling, these techniques are referred to as alternative invasive<br>
techniques sampling interstitial fluid.<br>
Sometimes, the literature refers to the alternative invasive technique as an<br>
alternative site glucose determination or as a minimally invasive technique. The<br>
minimally invasive nomenclature derives from the method by which the sample is<br>
collected. In this document, the alternative site glucose determinations that draw<br>
blood or interstitial fluid, even _ microliter, are considered to be alternative invasive<br>
glucose determination techniques as defined above. Examples of alternative<br>
invasive techniques include the TheraSense® FreeStyle™ when not sampling<br>
fingertips or toes, the Cygnus® GlucoWatch™, the One Touch® Ultra™, and<br>
equivalent technologies.<br><br>
Biosamples collected with alternative invasive techniques are analyzed via a large<br>
range of technologies. The most common of these technologies are summarized<br>
below:<br>
A.	Conventional: With some modification, the interstitial fluid samples may be<br>
analyzed by most of the technologies used to determine glucose concentrations<br>
in serum, plasma, or whole blood. These include electrochemical,<br>
electroenzymatic, and colorimetric approaches. For example, the enzymatic and<br>
colorimetric approaches described above may also be used to determine the<br>
glucose concentration in interstitial fluid samples.<br>
B.	Spectrophotometry: A number of approaches, for determining the glucose<br>
concentration in biosamples, have been developed that are based upon<br>
spectrophotometric technologies. These techniques include: Raman and<br>
fluorescence, as well as techniques using light from the ultraviolet through the<br>
infrared [ultraviolet (200 to 400 nm), visible (400 to 700 nm), near-JR (700 to 2500<br>
nm or 14,286 to 4000 cm-1), and infrared (2500 to 14,285 nm or 4000 to 700 cm<br>
1)].<br>
In this document, an invasive glucose analyzer is the genus of both the traditional<br>
invasive glucose analyzer species and the alternative invasive glucose analyzer<br>
species.<br>
Noninvasive Glucose Determination<br>
There exist a number of noninvasive approaches for glucose determination. These<br>
approaches vary widely, but have at least two common steps. First, an apparatus is<br><br>
used to acquire a reading from the body without obtaining a biological sample.<br>
Second, an algorithm is used to convert this reading into a glucose determination.<br>
One species of noninvasive glucose analyzers are those based upon the collection<br>
and analysis of spectra. Typically, a noninvasive apparatus uses some form of<br>
spectroscopy to acquire the signal or spectrum from the body. Used spectroscopic<br>
techniques include but are not limited to Raman, fluorescence, as well as techniques<br>
using light from ultraviolet through the infrared [ultraviolet (200 to 400 nm), visible<br>
(400 to 700 nm), near-IR (700 to 2500 nm or 14,286 to 4000 cm1), and infrared<br>
(2500 to 14,285 nm or 4000 to 700 cm"1)]. A particular range for noninvasive<br>
glucose determination in diffuse reflectance mode is about 1100 to 2500 nm or<br>
ranges therein (Hazen, Kevin H. "Glucose Determination in Biological Matrices Using<br>
Near-Infrared Spectroscopy", doctoral dissertation, University of Iowa, 1995). It is<br>
important to note, that these techniques are distinct from the traditionally invasive<br>
and alternative invasive techniques listed above in that the sample analyzed is a<br>
portion of the human body in-situ, not a biological sample acquired from the human<br>
body.<br>
Typically, three modes are used to collect noninvasive scans: transmittance,<br>
transflectance, and/or diffuse reflectance. For example the light, spectrum, or signal<br>
collected may be light transmitting through a region of the body, diffusely<br>
transmitting, diffusely reflected, or transflected. Transflected here refers to collection<br>
of the signal not at the incident point or area (diffuse reflectance), and not at the<br>
opposite side of the sample (transmittance), but rather at some point or region of the<br>
body between the transmitted and diffuse reflectance collection area. For example,<br>
transflected light enters the fingertip or forearm in one region and exits in another<br>
region. When using the near-IR, the transflected radiation typically radially disperses<br><br>
0.2 to 5 mm or more away from the incident photons depending on the wavelength<br>
used. For example, light that is strongly absorbed by the body such as light near the<br>
water absorbance maxima at 1450 or 1950 nm must be collected after a small radial<br>
divergence in order to be detected and light that is less absorbed such as light near<br>
water absorbance minima at 1300, 1600, or 2250 nm may be collected at greater<br>
radial or transflected distances from the incident photons.<br>
Noninvasive techniques are not limited to the fingertip. Other regions or volumes of<br>
the body subjected to noninvasive measurements are: a hand, finger, palmar region,<br>
base of thumb, forearm, volar aspect of the forearm, dorsal aspect of the forearm,<br>
upper arm, head, earlobe, eye, tongue, chest, torso, abdominal region, thigh, calf,<br>
foot, plantar region, and toe. It is important to note that noninvasive techniques do<br>
not have to be based upon spectroscopy. For example, a bioimpedence meter<br>
would be a noninvasive device. In this document, any device that reads glucose<br>
from the body without penetrating the skin and collecting a biological sample is<br>
referred to as a noninvasive glucose analyzer. For the purposes of this document,<br>
X-rays and MRI's are not considered to be defined in the realm of noninvasive<br>
technologies.<br>
Implantable Sensor for Glucose Determination<br>
There exist a number of approaches for implanting a glucose sensor into the body<br>
for glucose determination. These implantables may be used to collect a sample for<br>
further analysis or may acquire a reading of the sample directly or based upon direct<br>
reactions occurring with glucose. Two categories of implantable glucose analyzers<br>
exist: short-term and long-term.<br><br>
In this document, a device or a collection apparatus is referred to as a short-term<br>
implantable (as opposed to a long-term implantable) if part of the device penetrates<br>
the skin for a period of greater than three hours and less than one month. For<br>
example, a wick placed subcutaneously to collect a sample overnight that is<br>
removed and analyzed for glucose content representative of the interstitial fluid<br>
glucose concentration is referred to as a short term implantable. Similarly, a<br>
biosensor or electrode placed under the skin for a period of greater than three hours<br>
that reads directly or based upon direct reactions occurring with glucose<br>
concentration or level is referred to as a short-term implantable device. Conversely,<br>
devices such as a lancet, applied current, laser poration, or suction are referred to as<br>
either a traditional invasive or alternative invasive technique as they do not fulfill both<br>
the three hour and penetration of skin parameters. An example of a short-term<br>
implantable glucose analyzer is MiniMed's® continuous glucose monitoring system.<br>
In this document, long-term implantables are distinguished from short-term<br>
implantables by having the criteria that they must both penetrate the skin and be<br>
used for a period of one month or longer. Long term implantables may be in the<br>
body for greater than one month, one year, or many years.<br>
Implantable glucose analyzers vary widely, but have at least several steps in<br>
common. First, at least part of the device penetrates the skin. More commonly, the<br>
entire device is imbedded into the body. Second, the apparatus is used to acquire<br>
either a sample of the body or a signal relating directly or based upon direct<br>
reactions occurring with the glucose concentration within the body. If the implantable<br>
device collects a sample, readings or measurements on the sample may be<br>
collected after removal from the body. Alternatively, readings may be transmitted out<br>
of the body by the device or used for such purposes as insulin delivery while in the<br><br>
body. Third, an algorithm is used to convert the signal into a reading directly or<br>
based upon direct reactions occurring with the glucose concentration. An<br>
implantable analyzer may read from one or more of a variety of body fluids or tissues<br>
including but not limited to: arterial blood, venous blood, capillary blood, interstitial<br>
fluid, and selectively sampled interstitial fluid. An Implantable analyzer may also<br>
collect glucose information from skin tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, organ tissue, or<br>
through an artery or vein. For example, an implantable glucose analyzer may be<br>
placed transcutaneously, in the peritoneal cavity, in an artery, in muscle, or in an<br>
organ such as the liver or brain. The implantable glucose sensor may be one<br>
component of an artificial pancreas.<br>
Description of Related Technology<br>
One class of alternative invasive continuous glucose monitoring systems are those<br>
based upon iontophoresis. Using the iontophoresis process, uncharged molecules<br>
such as glucose may be moved across the skin barrier with the application of a small<br>
electric current. Several patents and publications in this area are available (Tamada,<br>

using iontophoresis. Consequently, the limitations of the device include the potential<br>
for significant skin irritation, collection of a biohazard, and a limit of three readings<br>
per hour.<br>
One class of semi-implantable glucose analyzers are those based upon open-flow<br>
microperfusion (Trajanowski, Zlatko; Brunner, Gemot A.; Schaupp, Lucas; Ellmerer,<br>
Martin; Wach, Paul; Pieber, Thomas R,; Kotanko, Peter; Skrabai, Falko "Open-Flow<br>
Microperfusion of Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue for ON-Line Continuous Ex Vivo<br>
Measurement of Glucose Concentration", Diabetes Care, 20, 1997, 1114-1120).<br>
Typically these systems are based upon biosensors and amperometric sensors<br>
(Trajanowski, Zlatko; Wach, Paul; Gfrerer, Robert "Portable Device for Continuous<br>
Fractionated Blood Sampling and Continuous ex vivo Blood Glucose Monitoring",<br><br>
Biosensors and Bioelectronics, H, 1996, 479-487). A common issue with semi-<br>
implantable and implantable devices is coating by proteins. The MiniMed®<br>
continuous glucose monitoring system, a short-term implantable, is the first<br>
commercially available semi-continuous glucose monitor in this class. The MiniMed®<br>
system is capable of providing a glucose profile for up to seventy-two hours. The<br>
system records a glucose value every five minutes. The technology behind the<br>
MiniMed® system relies on a probe being invasively implanted into a subcutaneous<br>
region followed by a glucose oxidase based reaction producing hydrogen peroxide,<br>
which is oxidized at a platinum electrode to produce an analytical current. Notably,<br>
the MiniMed® system automatically shifts glucose determinations by ten minutes in<br>
order to accommodate for a potential dynamic lag between the blood and interstitial<br>
glucose (Gross, Todd M.; Bode, Bruce W.; Einhorn, Daniel; Kayne, David M.; Reed,<br>

MiniMed Continuous Glucose Monitoring System During Patient Home Use",<br>

Am., J. Physiol., 277, 1999, E561-E571, 0193-1849/99, The American Physiological<br>
Society, 1999).<br>
Other approaches, such as the continuous monitoring system reported by Gross, et<br>
al. (Gross, T.M., B.W. Bode, D. Einhom, D.M. Kayne, J.H. Reed, N.H. White and J.J.<br>
Mastrototaro, "Performance Evaluation of the MiniMed® Continuous Glucose<br>
Monitoring System During Patient Home Use," Diabetes Technology &amp; Therapeutics.<br>
Vol. 2, Num. 1, 2000), involve the implantation of a sensor in tissue with a<br>
transcutaneous external connector. Inherent in these approaches are health risks<br><br>
due to the sensor implantation, infections, patient inconvenience, and measurement<br>
delay.<br>
Another approach towards continuous glucose monitoring is through the use of<br>
fluorescence. For example Sensors for Medicine and Science incorporated (S4MS)<br>
is developing a glucose selective indicator molecule combined into an implantable<br>
device that is coupled via telemetry to an external device. The device works via an<br>
indicator molecule that reversibly binds to glucose. With an LED for excitation, the<br>
indicator molecule fluoresces in the presence of glucose. This device is an example<br>
of a short-term implantable with development towards a long-term implantable<br>
(Colvin, Arthur E. "Optical-Based Sensing Devices Especially for In-SItu Sensing in<br>
Humans", U.S. Patent # 6,304,766, October 16, 2001; Colvin, Arthur E.; Dale,<br>

2002).<br>
Notably, none of these technologies are noninvasive. Further, none of these<br>
technologies offer continuous glucose determination.<br>
Another technology, near-infrared spectroscopy, provides the opportunity to measure<br>
glucose noninvasively with a relativity short sampling interval. This approach<br>
involves the illumination of a spot on the body with near-infrared electromagnetic<br><br>
radiation (light in the wavelength range 700 to 2500 nm). The incident light is<br>
partially absorbed and scattered, according to its interaction with the constituents of<br>
the tissue. The actual tissue volume that is sampled is the portion of irradiated<br>
tissue from which light is diffusely reflected, transflected, or transmitted by the<br>
sample and optically coupled to the spectrometer detection system. The signal due<br>
to glucose is extracted from the spectral measurement through various methods of<br>
signal processing and one or more mathematical models. The models are<br>
developed through the process of calibration on the basis of an exemplary set of<br>
spectral measurements and associated reference blood glucose values (the<br>
calibration set) based on an analysis of capillary (fingertip), alternative invasive<br>
samples, or venous blood. To date, only discrete glucose determinations have been<br>
reported using near-IR technologies.<br>
There exists a body of work on noninvasive glucose determination using near-IR<br>
technology, the most pertinent of which are referred here (Robinson, Mark Ries;<br>

Mode of Analysis<br>
A measurement of glucose is termed "direct" when the net analyte due to the<br>
absorption of light by glucose in the tissue is extracted from the spectral<br>
measurement through various methods of signal processing and/or one or more<br>
mathematical models. In this document, an analysis is referred to as direct if the<br>
analyte of interest is involved in a chemical reaction. For example, in equation 1<br>
glucose reacts with oxygen in the presence of glucose oxidase to form hydrogen<br><br>
peroxide and gluconolactone. The reaction products may be involved in subsequent<br>
reactions such as that in equation 2. The measurement of any reaction component<br>
or product is a direct reading of glucose, herein. In this document, a direct reading of<br>
glucose would also entail any reading in which the electromagnetic signal generated<br>
is due to interaction with glucose or a compound of glucose. For example, the<br>
fluorescence approach listed above by Sensors for Medicine and Science is termed<br>
a direct reading of glucose, herein.<br>
A measurement of glucose is termed "indirect" when movement of glucose within the<br>
body affects physiological parameters. In brief, an indirect glucose determination<br>
may be based upon a change in glucose concentration causing an ancillary<br>
physiological, physical, or chemical response that is relatively large. A key finding<br>
related to the noninvasive measurement of glucose Is that a major physiological<br>
response accompanies changes in glucose and can be detected noninvasively<br>
through the resulting changes in tissue properties.<br>
An indirect measurement of blood glucose through assessment of correlated tissue<br>
properties and/or physiological responses requires a different strategy when<br>
compared with the direct measurement of glucose spectral signals. Direct<br>
measurement of glucose requires the removal of spectral variation due to other<br>
constituents and properties in order to enhance the net analyte signal of glucose.<br>
Because the signal directly attributable to glucose in tissue is small, an indirect<br>
calibration to correlated constituents or properties, e.g. the physiological response to<br>
glucose, is attractive due to a gain in relative signal size. For example, changes in<br>
the concentration of glucose alters the distribution of water in the various tissue<br>
compartments. Because water has a large NIR signal that is relatively easy to<br>
measure compared to glucose, a calibration based at least in part on the<br><br>
compartmental activity of water has a magnified signal related to glucose. An<br>
indirect measurement may be referred to as a measurement of an ancillary effect of<br>
the target analyte. An indirect measurement means that an ancillary effect due to<br>
changes in glucose concentration is being measured.<br>
A major component of the body is water. A re-distribution of water between the<br>
vascular and extravascular compartments and the intra- and extra-cellar<br>
compartments is observed as a response to differences in glucose concentrations in<br>
the compartments during periods of changing blood glucose. Water, among other<br>
analytes, is shifted between the tissue compartments to equilibrate the osmotic<br>
imbalance related to changes in glucose concentration as predicted by Fick's law of<br>
diffusion and the fact that water diffuses much faster in the body than does glucose.<br>
Therefore, a strategy for the indirect measurement of glucose that exploits the near-<br>
infrared signal related to fluid re-distribution is to design measurement protocols that<br>
force maximum correlation between blood glucose and the re-distribution of fluids.<br>
This is the opposite strategy of the one required for the direct measurement of blood<br>
glucose in which the near-infrared signals directly related to glucose and fluids must<br>
be discriminated and attempts at equalizing glucose in the body compartment are<br>
made. A reliable indirect measurement of glucose based at least in part in the re-<br>
distribution of fluids and analytes (other than glucose) and related changes In the<br>
optical properties of tissue requires that the indirect signals are largely due to the<br>
changing blood glucose concentration. Other variables and sources that modify or<br>
change the indirect signals of interest should be prevented or minimized in order to<br>
ensure a reliable indirect measurement of glucose.<br>
One interference to a determination of blood/tissue glucose concentration measured<br>
indirectly is a rapid change in blood perfusion, which also leads to fluid movement<br><br>
between the compartments. This type of physiological change interferes<br>
constructively or destructively with the analyte signal of the indirect measurement. In<br>
order to preserve a blood glucose/fluid shift calibration it is beneficial to control other<br>
factors influencing fluid shifts including local blood perfusion.<br>
Near-IR Instrumentation<br>
A number of technologies have been reported for measuring glucose noninvasively<br>
that involve the measurement of a tissue related variable. One species of<br>
noninvasive glucose analyzers use some form of spectroscopy to acquire the signal<br>
or spectrum from the body. Examples include but are not limited to far-infrared<br>
absorbance spectroscopy, tissue impedance, Raman, and fluorescence, as well as<br>
techniques using light from the ultraviolet through the infrared [ultraviolet (200 to 400<br>
nm), visible (400 to 700 nm), near-IR (700 to 2500 nm or 14,286 to 4000 cm'1), and<br>
infrared (2500 to 14,285 nm or 4000 to 700 cm-1)]. A particular range for noninvasive<br>
glucose determination in diffuse reflectance mode is about 1100 to 2500 nm or<br>
ranges therein (Hazen, Kevin H. "Glucose Determination in Biological Matrices Using<br>
Near-Infrared Spectroscopy", doctoral dissertation, University of Iowa, 1995). It is<br>
important to note, that these techniques are distinct from invasive techniques in that<br>
the sample analyzed is a portion of the human body in-situ, not a biological sample<br>
acquired from the human body. The actual tissue volume that is sampled is the<br>
portion of irradiated tissue from which light is diffusely reflected, transflected, or<br>
diffusely transmitted to the spectrometer detection system. These techniques share<br>
the common characteristic that a calibration is required to derive a glucose<br>
concentration from subsequent collected data.<br><br>
A number of spectrometer configurations exist for collecting noninvasive spectra of<br>
regions of the body. Typically a spectrometer has one or more beam paths from a<br>
source to a detector. A light source may include a blackbody source, a tungsten-<br>
halogen source, one or more LED's, or one or more laser diodes. For multi-<br>
wavelength spectrometers a wavelength selection device may be used or a series of<br>
optical filters may be used for wavelength selection. Wavelength selection devices<br>
include dispersive elements such as one or more plane, concave, ruled, or<br>
holographic grating. Additional wavelength selective devices include an<br>
interferometer, successive illumination of the elements of an LED array, prisms, and<br>
wavelength selective filters. However, variation of the source such as varying which<br>
LED or diode is firing may be used. Detectors may be in the form of one or more<br>
single element detectors or one or more arrays or bundles of detectors. Detectors<br>
may include InGaAs, extended InGaAs, PbS, PbSe, Si, MCT, or the like. Detectors<br>
may further include arrays of InGaAs, extended InGaAs, PbS, PbSe, Si, MCT, or the<br>
like. Light collection optics such as fiber optics, lenses, and mirrors are commonly<br>
used in various configurations within a spectrometer to direct light from the source to<br>
the detector by way of a sample. The mode of operation may be diffuse<br>
transmission, diffuse reflectance, or transflectance. Due to changes in performance<br>
of the overall spectrometer, reference wavelength standards are often scanned.<br>
Typically, a wavelength standard is collected immediately before or after the<br>
interrogation of the tissue or at the beginning of the day, but may occur at times far<br>
removed such as when the spectrometer was originally manufactured. A typical<br>
reference wavelength standard would be polystyrene or a rare earth oxide such as<br>
holmium, erbium, or dysprosium oxide. Many additional materials exist that have<br>
stable and sharp spectral features that may be used as a reference standard.<br><br>
The interface of the glucose analyzer to the tissue includes a module where light<br>
such as near-infrared radiation is directed to and from the tissue either directly or<br>
through a light pipe, fiber-optics, a lens system, or a light directing mirror system.<br>
The area of the tissue surface to which near-infrared radiation is applied and the<br>
area of the tissue surface the returning near-infrared radiation is detected from are<br>
different and separated by a defined distance and selected to target a tissue volume<br>
conducive for the measurement of the property of interest. The patient interface<br>
module may include an elbow rest, a wrist rest, a hand support, and/or a guide to<br>
assist in interfacing the illumination mechanism of choice and the tissue of interest.<br>
Generally, an optical coupling fluid is placed on the sampling surface to increase<br>
incident photon penetration into the skin and to minimize specular reflectance from<br>
the surface of the skin. Important parameters in the interface include temperature<br>
and pressure.<br>
The sample site is the specific tissue of the subject that is irradiated by the<br>
spectrometer system and the surface or point on the subject the measurement probe<br>
comes into contact with. The ideal qualities of the sample site include homogeneity,<br>
immutability, and accessibility to the target analyte. Several measurement sites may<br>
be used, including the abdomen, upper arm, thigh, hand (palm or back of the hand),<br>
ear lobe, finger, the volar aspect of the forearm, or the dorsal part of the forearm.<br>
In addition, while the measurement can be made in either diffuse reflectance or<br>
diffuse transmittance mode, the preferred method is diffuse reflectance. The<br>
scanning of the tissue can be done continuously when pulsation effects do not affect<br>
the tissue area being tested, or the scanning can be done intermittently between<br>
pulses.<br><br>
The collected signal (near-infrared radiation in this case) is converted to a voltage<br>
and sampled through an analog-to-digital converter for analysis on a microprocessor<br>
based system and the result displayed.<br>
Preprocessing<br>
Several approaches exist that employ diverse preprocessing methods to remove<br>
spectral variation related to the sample and instrumental variation including<br>
normalization, smoothing, derivatives, multiplicative signal correction (Geladi, P., D.<br>
McDougall and H. Martens. "Linearization and Scatter-Correction for Near-Infrared<br>
Reflectance Spectra of Meat," Applied Spectroscopy, vol. 39, pp. 491-500, 1985),<br>
standard normal variate transformation (R.J. Barnes, M.S. Dhanoa, and S. Lister,<br>
Applied Spectroscopy, 43, pp. 772-777, 1989), piecewise multiplicative scatter<br>
correction (T. Isaksson and B. R. Kowalski, Applied Spectroscopy, 47, pp. 702-709,<br>
1993), extended multiplicative signal correction H Martens and E. Stark, J. Pharm<br>
Biomed Anal, 9, pp. 625-635, 1991), pathlength correction with chemical modeling<br>
and optimized scaling ("GlucoWatch Automatic Glucose Biographer and<br>
AutoSensors", Cygnus Inc., Document #1992-00, Rev. March 2001), and FIR<br>
filtering (Sum, S.T., "Spectral Signal Correction for Multivariate Calibration," Doctoral<br>

S.D. Brown and S.L. Monfre, "Transfer of near-infrared multivariate calibrations<br>
without standards," Analytical Chemistry, 68, pp. 2987-2995, 1996). In addition, a<br>
diversity of signal, data or pre-processing techniques are commonly reported with<br>
the fundamental goal of enhancing accessibility of the net analyte signal (Massart,<br>

Differentiation of Data by Simplified Least Squares Procedures," Anal. Chem., vol.<br>
36, no. 8, pp. 1627-1639, 1964). The goal of all of these techniques is to attenuate<br>
the noise and instrumental variation without affecting the signal of interest.<br>
While methods for preprocessing effectively compensate for variation related to<br>
instrument and physical changes in the sample and enhance the net analyte signal<br>
in the presence of noise and interference, they are often inadequate for<br>
compensating for the sources of tissue related variation. For example, the highly<br>
nonlinear effects related sampling different tissue locations can't be effectively<br>
compensated for through a pathlength correction because the sample is multi-<br>
layered and heterogeneous. In addition, fundamental assumptions inherent in these<br>
methods, such as the constancy of multiplicative and additive effects across the<br>
spectral range and homoscadasticity of noise are violated in the non-invasive tissue<br>
application.<br>
Near-IR Calibration<br>
One noninvasive technology, near-infrared spectroscopy, has been heavily<br>
researched for its application for both frequent and painless noninvasive<br>
measurement of glucose. This approach involves the illumination of a spot on the<br><br>
body with near-infrared (NIR) electromagnetic radiation, light in the wavelength<br>
range of 700 to 2500 nm. The light is partially absorbed and scattered, according to<br>
its interaction with the constituents of the tissue. With near-infrared spectroscopy, a<br>
mathematical relationship between an in-vivo near-infrared measurement and the<br>
actual blood glucose value needs to be developed. This is achieved through the<br>
collection of in-vivo NIR measurements with corresponding blood glucose values that<br>
have been obtained directly through the use of measurement tools such as the YSI,<br>
HemoCue, or any appropriate and accurate traditional invasive or alternative<br>
invasive reference device.<br>
For spectrophotometric based analyzers, there are several univariate and<br>
multivariate methods that can be used to develop this mathematical relationship.<br>
However, the basic equation which is being solved is known as the Beer-Lambert<br>
Law. This law states that the strength of an absorbance/reflectance measurement is<br>
proportional to the concentration of the analyte which is being measured as in<br>
equation 3,<br>
A = ε b C	eq. 3<br>
where A is the absorbanee/reflectance measurement at a given wavelength of light, e<br>
is the molar absorptivity associated with the molecule of interest at the same given<br>
wavelength, b is the distance (or pathlength) that the light travels, and C is the<br>
concentration of the molecule of interest (glucose).<br>
Chemometric calibration techniques extract the glucose related signal from the<br>
measured spectrum through various methods of signal processing and calibration<br><br>
including one or more mathematical models. The models are developed through the<br>
process of calibration on the basis of an exemplary set of spectral measurements<br>
known as the calibration set and an associated set of reference blood glucose values<br>
based upon an analysis of fingertip capillary blood, venous, or alternative site<br>
samples. Common multivariate approaches requiring a set of exemplary reference<br>
glucose concentrations and an associated sample spectrum include partial least<br>
squares (PLS) and principal component regression (PCR). Many additional forms of<br>
calibration are well known in the art such as neural networks.<br>
Because every method has error, it is beneficial that the primary device, which is<br>
used to measure blood glucose be as accurate as possible to minimize the error that<br>
propagates through the mathematical relationship which is developed. While it<br>
appears intuitive that any U.S. FDA approved blood glucose monitor could be used,<br>
for accurate verification of the secondary method a monitor which has an accuracy of<br>
less than 5% is desirable. Meters with increased error such as 10% are acceptable,<br>
though the error of the device being calibrated may increase.<br>
Currently, no device using near-infrared spectroscopy for the noninvasive<br>
measurement of glucose has been approved for use by persons with diabetes due to<br>
technology limitations that include poor sensitivity, sampling problems, time lag,<br>
calibration bias, long-term reproducibility, stability, and instrument noise.<br>
Fundamentally, however, accurate noninvasive estimation of blood glucose is<br>
presently limited by the available near-Infrared technology, the trace concentration of<br>
glucose relative to other constituents, and the dynamic nature of the skin and living<br>
tissue of the patient. Further limitations to commercialization include a poor form<br>
factor (large size, heavy weight, and no or poor portability) and usability. For<br>
example, existing near-infrared technology is limited to larger devices that do not<br><br>
provide (nearly) continuous or automated measurement of glucose and are difficult<br>
for consumers to operate.<br>
Clearly, a need exists for a completely noninvasive approach to the measurement of<br>
glucose that provides a nearly continuous readings in an automated fashion.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention involves the monitoring of a biological parameter through a compact<br>
analyzer. The preferred apparatus is a spectrometer based system that is attached<br>
continuously or semi-continuously to a human subject and collects spectral<br>
measurements that are used to determine a biological parameter in the sampled<br>
tissue. The preferred target analyte is glucose. The preferred analyzer is a near-IR<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The presently preferred embodiment of the invention uses a sampling module<br>
coupled to a base module. The sampling module includes an illumination system<br>
based upon an incandescent lamp. The base module includes a grating and<br>
detector array. The base module may be connected to the sampling module through<br>
a communication bundle. In this document, the combined sampling module,<br>
communication bundle, base module, and associated electronics and software is<br>
referred to as a spectrometer and/or glucose analyzer. In Figure 1, the sampling<br>
module 10 is semi-permanently attached to the forearm of a subject 12, a<br>
communication bundle 14 carries optical and/or electrical signal to and/or from a<br>
base module 16 located on a table, and the communication bundle carries power to<br>
the sampling module from the base module.<br>
A block diagram of the noninvasive glucose analyzer is provided in Figure 2.<br>
Essential elements of the glucose analyzer are the source 21, guiding optics 14<br>
before and/or after the sample for coupling the source to the sample and the sample<br>
to the detector(s) 23, detector(s) and associated electronics 24, and data processing<br><br>
system 25. In Figure 2, an optional optical filter 30, light blocker 31, and<br>
standardization material 32 are shown. These components may also be positioned<br>
after the sample and before the detector. Variations of this simple block diagram are<br>
readily appreciated and understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
The sampling module, base module, and communication bundle are further<br>
described herein. Key features of the invention may include but are not limited to:<br>
a semi-permanent patient/instrument interface sampling module 10 incorporating at<br>
least one of a low profile sampling interface 34, a low wattage stabilized source 21<br>
in close proximity to the sampled site, an excitation collection cavity or optics, a<br>
guide, a preheated interfacing solution such as fluorinert, a temperature controlled<br>
skin sample, a mechanism for constant pressure and/or displacement of the sampled<br>
skin tissue, a photonic stimulation source, and collection optics or fiber.<br>
In the preferred embodiment the sampling module protrudes less than two<br>
centimeters from the skin measurement site. The sampling module may interface<br>
with a guide that may be semi-permanently attached to a sampling location on a<br>
human body. The guide aids in continuously and/or periodically physically and<br>
optically coupling the sampling module to the tissue measurement site in a<br>
repeatable manner with minimal disturbance. In addition, the guide in combination<br>
with the sampling module is responsible for pretreatment of the sample site for<br>
providing appropriate contact of the sampling device to the skin for the purpose of<br>
reducing specular reflectance, approaching and maintaining appropriate skin<br>
temperature variation, and inducing skin hydration changes. The sampling module<br>
preferably collects a diffusely reflected or transflected signal from the sampled region<br>
of skin.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, the base module or semi-remote system includes at<br>
least a wavelength selection device such as a grating 35 and a detector preferably a<br>
detector array with an optional wavelength reference standard 36 such as<br>
polystyrene and an optional intensity reference standard such as a 99% reflective<br>
Labsphere® disk. The remote system is coupled to the sampling module via a<br>
communication bundle 14 that carries as least the optical signal and optionally<br>
power. Additionally, the communication bundle may transmit control and monitoring<br>
signal between the sampling module and the remote system. The remote system<br>
has at least one of an embedded computer 25, a display 37, and an interface to an<br>
external computer system. The remote system may be in close proximity to the<br>
guide element.<br>
In one version of the invention, the sampling module and base module are integrated<br>
together into a compact handheld unit. The communication bundle is integrated<br>
between the two systems.<br>
One version of the sampling module of the invention is presented in Figure 3. The<br>
housing 301 is made of silicon. The lamp 302 is a 0.8 W tungsten halogen source<br>
(Welch-Allyn 01270) coupled to a reflector 303. A photodiode 309 is used to monitor<br>
the lamp and to keep its output stable through the use of a lamp output control<br>
circuit, especially right after power-up. The reflector, and hence the incident light, is<br>
centered on an angle six degrees off of the skin's normal to allow room for a<br>
collection fiber. The light is focused through a 1 mm thick silicon window 306 onto<br>
an aperture at the skin. The silicon operates as a longpass filter. The illuminated<br>
aperture of the skin has a 2.4 mm diameter. Positioning onto a sampling site is<br>
performed through a guide. The patient sampling module reversibly couples into the<br>
guide for reproducible contact pressure and sampling location. Magnets 312 are<br><br>
used in the guide to aid in the positioning of the probe, to ensure proper penetration<br>
of the probe into the guide aperture and to enable a constant pressure and/or<br>
displacement interface of the sampled skin 308. The reversible nature of coupling<br>
the sampling module into the guide allows the sampling module to be removed and<br>
coupled to an intensity reference and/or a wavelength reference that have the same<br>
guide interface and are preferably housed with the base module. The preferred<br>
intensity reference is a 99% reflective Labsphere® material and the preferred<br>
wavelength reference is polystyrene. The preferred sampling module uses a heater<br>
309 for maintaining the skin at a constant temperature. A 600 µm detection fiber 310<br>
collects diffusely reflected light from the center of the silicon window. The detection<br>
fiber is coated in a manner to block source photons from penetrating through the<br>
cladding to the core. For example a metal sheath may be placed around the<br>
detection fiber. In this configuration, the length of the detection fiber is 0.7 meters.<br>
The communication bundle includes a power supply from the base unit. A blocking<br>
mechanism may be included to allow the detection of detector dark current or<br>
baseline. The base module incorporating a grating, detected array, associated<br>
electronics, and associated software is coupled to the sampling module via this<br>
bundle. In this configuration, the sampling module extends roughly three inches<br>
from the arm.<br>
It should be appreciated that in the preferred embodiment, many of the components<br>
are optional and/or variable. Some specific variations are described in this section.<br>
It is recognized that the components or properties discussed in this section may be<br>
varied or in some cases eliminated without altering the scope and intent of the<br>
invention.<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, the base module resides on a table, the sampling<br>
module interfaces through a semi-permanentiy attached guide to the dorsal aspect of<br>
the forearm, and a communication bundle carries power and optical signal between<br>
the two modules. Alternatively, the base module may be worn on the person, for<br>
example on a belt. The sampling module could couple to any of a hand, finger,<br>
palmar region, base of thumb, forearm, volar aspect of the forearm, dorsal aspect of<br>
the forearm, upper arm, head, earlobe, eye, tongue, chest, torso, abdominal region,<br>
thigh, calf, foot, plantar region, and toe. When the base module is on the table, it<br>
may plug into a standard wall outlet for power. When worn on the person, the<br>
module may be battery powered. When the base module is worn on the person, an<br>
optional docking station may be provided as described below for power and data<br>
analysis. It is noted here that the base module may couple directly to the sampling<br>
module without a communication bundle. The combined base module and sampling<br>
module may be integrated into a handheld near-IR based glucose analyzer that<br>
couples to the sampling site through an optional guide.<br>
Sampling Module<br>
The sampling module housing in the preferred embodiment was selected to be<br>
constructed of silicon based upon a number of factors including but not limited to:<br>
providing a minimum of 6 O.D. blocking in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-IR from<br>
700 to 1000 nm at a 1 mm thickness, low cost, manufacturability, durability, water<br>
resistance, and availability. It is recognized that it is the functionality of the housing<br>
that is important and that the above listed properties may be obtained through a<br>
variety of materials such as metals, composites, and plastics without altering the<br>
scope and intent of the invention.<br><br>
The 0.8 W tungsten halogen source is preferred for a number of reasons including<br>
but not limited to its power requirements, performance specifications such as color<br>
temperature, spectral output, and lifetime as well as on parameters such as<br>
ruggedness, portability, cost, and size. It is recognized that the source power is<br>
selected based upon the total net analyte signal generated and the amount of light<br>
reaching the detection system. It has been determined that the 0.8 W source in<br>
conjunction with the aperture and collection fiber of the preferred embodiment<br>
provides adequate signal and depth of penetration of the photons for the indirect<br>
determination of glucose using features in the 1150 to 1850 nm range. However,<br>
sources ranging from 0.05 W to 5 W may be used in this invention. As described in<br>
the alternative embodiment section, light emitting diodes (LED's) may be used as the<br>
source. The source is preferably powered by the base module through the<br>
connection cable described below. However, especially with the smaller sources a<br>
battery power supply may be incorporated into the sampling module.<br>
A photodiode is used in the preferred embodiment in conjunction with feedback<br>
control electronics to maintain the source at constant power output during data<br>
collection which is desirable during data acquisition. The photodiode is placed<br>
before the order sorter (the silicon longpass filter), in order to detect visible light from<br>
the source. The preferred photodiode is a silicon detector. Other less desirable<br>
photodiodes include but are not limited to InGaAs, InPGaAs, PbS, and PbSe. This<br>
arrangement of components is preferred due to the low cost, durability, and<br>
availability of detectors available in the visible and near-IR from 700 to 1000 nm<br>
where the long pass filter discussed below used later in the optical train blocks the<br>
optical signal used in the feedback loop. The control electronics allow the source to<br>
be driven at different levels at different points in time during and prior to data<br><br>
acquisition. In the preferred embodiment, the source is initially run at a higher power<br>
in order to minimize the analyzer warm-up time. The photodiode and feedback<br>
electronics are optional, but are used in the preferred embodiment. Many<br>
spectrometers are common in the art that do not use a separate detector for<br>
monitoring the source intensity.<br>
The source housing/reflector combination in the preferred embodiment was selected<br>
based upon a number of factors including but not limited to: providing acceptable<br>
energy delivery to the sample site, reflectivity, manufacturability, ruggedness, size,<br>
cost, and providing appropriate heating/temperature control of the sample site. The<br>
specific reflector in the preferred embodiment is parabolic. The properties were<br>
optimized using standard ray trace software to image the lamp filament onto the<br>
aperture defining the sampling location. The optical prescription is tuned for a<br>
specific spectral range (1100 to 1900 nm) and the coatings are designed to reflect<br>
optimally in this range. It is recognized that the reflector may be elliptical or even<br>
spherical and that the mechanical and optical properties of the reflector may be<br>
varied without altering the scope and intent of the invention. For example, in the<br>
simplest embodiment the source may shine light directly onto the sampled surface<br>
without the use of a reflector. In such cases, in order to deliver similar energy to the<br>
sampled skin through the aperture, a larger source is required. In another example,<br>
the specific focal distance of the reflector may be varied, which impacts the overall<br>
dimensions of the interface without affecting functionality. Similarly, a different<br>
substrate may be used as the reflector or metallized coatings such as gold, silver,<br>
and aluminum may be applied to the substrate.<br>
The source/housing reflector in the preferred embodiment may be modified to bring<br>
in the source light nearly parallel to the skin surface. One objective of a low profile<br><br>
design is to maintain a sampling module that may be semi-permanentiy attached to<br>
the sampling site. A low profile sampling module has the benefit of increase<br>
acceptance by the consumer and is less susceptible to bumping or jarring during<br>
normal wear. A semi-permanent interface would allow consecutive glucose<br>
determinations in an automated continuous or semi-continuous fashion as described<br>
below. Light brought in at a low angle relative to the skin may be turned into the skin<br>
with folding optics. A simple mirror may be used; however, a focusing mirror is<br>
preferred in order to optimally couple light into the aperture. A representative<br>
embodiment is provided in Figure 4.<br>
One feature that may be used in this embodiment and in the other embodiments is<br>
the use of quick connect optics. In this case a 600 µm fiber 40 is used as the<br>
collection optic. The 600 µm fiber is fixed into the sampling module 41. The<br>
sampling module has a connector for accepting a 300 µm fiber 42 that in turn<br>
couples to a slit prior to the grating in the base module. The coupling of the light<br>
may be done by lenses, which may be magnifying or de-magnifying or with folding<br>
mirrors 44 with appropriate attention to matching numerical apertures. An important<br>
concept in this design is that the second collection optic is readily removed from the<br>
sampling module allowing the sampling module to remain in contact with the arm. In<br>
addition, the quick connect optic allows the user to travel remotely from the base<br>
module until the next reading is desired.<br>
Locating the source and reflector housing near the skin allows for temperature<br>
control/warm-up of the skin. The optical source is a heat source. Skin temperature<br>
is an important variable in near-IR noninvasive glucose determination. A thermistor<br>
45 sensing the sampling module or patient skin temperature and feeding this<br>
information back to the source via feedback electronics prior to sampling may be<br><br>
used prior spectral data acquisition in order elevate the skin temperature to a<br>
desirable sampling range such as 30 to 40 degrees centigrade. The inclusion of a<br>
heater, thermistor, and associated feedback electronics are optional to this invention.<br>
In another embodiment, the skin temperature may be measured spectrally by the<br>
relative positions of water, fat, and protein in an acquired near-IR spectrum or<br>
through a multivariate analysis.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, an optical filter is placed between the source and the<br>
sampling site. In the preferred embodiment, the optical filter is silicon. The silicon<br>
window was selected based upon a number of factors. One factor is that silicon<br>
behaves as a longpass filter with blocking to at least six optical density units with a 1<br>
mm thickness from the ultraviolet through the visible to 1000 nm. Second, the<br>
longpass characteristic of silicon acts as an order sorter benefiting the grating<br>
detector combination in the base module. Third, longpass characteristics of silicon<br>
removes unwanted photons in the ultraviolet, visible, and near-IR that would heat the<br>
skin at unwanted depths and to undesirable temperatures due to conversion of the<br>
light into heat via the process of absorbance. Instead, the silicon is heated by these<br>
photons resulting in maintenance of skin temperature near the surface via<br>
conduction. Fourth, silicon offers excellent transmissive features in the near-IR over<br>
the spectral region of interest of 1150 to 1850 nm. Notably, silicon is the same<br>
material as the source housing and source reflector. Therefore, a single molding or<br>
part may be used for all three components. In the preferred embodiment, a silicon<br>
window is in contact with the skin to minimize specular reflectance. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, this window is anti-reflection coated based upon properties of air on the<br>
photon incident side and based upon the optical properties of the coupling fluid on<br>
the skin surface side of the optic.<br><br>
Many configurations exist in which the longpass filter is not in direct contact with the<br>
skin. First, the longpass filter may be placed after the source but not in contact with<br>
the skin. For example, the filter may be placed in or about the pupil plane. In this<br>
configuration, photons removed by the filter that result in the heating of the filter do<br>
not result in direct heating of the sample site via conduction. Rather, the much<br>
slower and less efficient convection process conveys this heat. This reduces the risk<br>
of over heating the skin. Alternatively, two filters may be placed between the source<br>
and the skin. These filters may or may not be the same. The first filter removes heat<br>
as above. The second filter reduces spectral reflectance as above. In a third<br>
configuration, the order sorter nature of the longpass filter is central. Silicon<br>
removes light under 1050 nm. This allows a grating to be used in the 1150 to 1850<br>
nm region without the detection of second or higher order light off of the grating as<br>
long as the longpass filter, silicon, is placed before the grating. Therefore, in the<br>
third configuration the longpass filter may be after the sample.<br>
It is recognized that many filter designs exist. In the preferred embodiment a silicon<br>
longpass filter is used. The filters may be coated to block particular regions such as<br>
1900 to 2500 nm, antireflection-coated in order to match refractive indices and<br>
increase light throughput, and/or used in combination with other filters such as<br>
shortpass filters. One configuration coats the silicon with a blocker from 1900 to<br>
2500 nm. This has the advantage of removing the largest intensity of the blackbody<br>
curve of a typical tungsten halogen source that is not blocked by silicon or in the<br>
desirable region of 1150 to 1850 nm. This blocking band may cover any region from<br>
about 1800 nm on up to 3000 nm. Another configuration is a silicon longpass filter<br>
used in combination with an RG glass such as RG-850 that cuts off at about 2500<br>
nm. The combination provides a very cost effective and readily reproduced<br><br>
bandpass filter passing light from approximately 1100 to 2500 nm. Notably this filter<br>
combination may be used in conjunction with a coating layer such as a blocker from<br>
1900 to 2500 nm in order to provide a bandpass from 1100 to 1900 nm. Those<br>
skilled in the art will recognize that there exist multiple configurations of off the shelf<br>
and customized longpass, shortpass, and bandpass filter that may be placed in one<br>
or more of the locations described above that fulfill the utility requirements described<br>
above. An alternative embodiment of the source/reflector/filter is shown in Figure 5.<br>
In this embodiment, silicon is shaped into a parabolic optic 50 surrounding part of the<br>
source 51. The outside of the silicon is coated with a reflector 52 such as gold. This<br>
embodiment allows a low profile source coupled to the skin. The total height off of<br>
the skin may be Jess than 1 cm with this configuration. The shape of the silicon optic<br>
in conjunction with coating the outside of the silicon with a reflective material such as<br>
gold allows efficient coupling of the photons into the skin. An additional optional<br>
protective coating over the reflector material allows the silicon optic to also act as a<br>
housing for the sampling module with the benefits of silicon listed above. Notably,<br>
the initial surface of the silicon (near the source) removes the higher energy photons<br>
that results in heating of the source optics prior to contact with the skin. The later<br>
part of the silicon (near the skin) in combination with a collection fiber acts as a<br>
mechanism for reducing specular reflectance. This configuration eliminates the<br>
optional two filter system as heat and spectral reflectance are dealt with in one optic.<br>
Essentially, the silicon is acting as a turning optic to allow a very low profile sampling<br>
module, as a longpass filter, as an order sorter, as a heat blocker, as a spectral<br>
reflectance blocker, and as a very manufacturable, cheap, and durable component.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the source/reflector/filter is shown in Figure 6. In this<br>
embodiment, the source filament 60 is wrapped around a collection fiber 61. The<br><br>
reflector now directs light into the skin aperture through an optic 62. The optic may<br>
be surface coated for reflectance on the incident light surface. Alternatively, as<br>
above, the reflector may be transmissive and the outer surface of the reflector may<br>
be reflectively coated. As above, this allow the reflector to act as the housing. In<br>
this embodiment, there exists a filter adjacent to the skin that in conjunction with a<br>
collection optic, fiber, or tube adjacent to the skin results in the blocking of specular<br>
reflectance.<br>
An alternative embodiment combines a broadband source with a single element<br>
detector without the use of a grating. In one case, an interferometer composed of<br>
two parallel, highly reflecting plates separated by an air gap may be used. One of<br>
the parallel plates may be translated mechanically such that the distance between<br>
the plates varies. Technically, this is a Fabry-Perot interferometer. When the mirror<br>
distance is fixed and adjusted for parallelism by a spacer such as invar or quartz, the<br>
system is referred to as a Fabry-Perot etalon. This system allows narrow excitation<br>
lines as a function of time. Therefore, no dispersive element is required and a single<br>
element detector may be used. The interferometer may be placed in one of multiple<br>
positions in the optical train.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the illuminated aperture of the skin has a 2.4 mm<br>
diameter. The aperture in the preferred embodiment was selected based upon a<br>
number of factors including but not limited to: providing optical pathlengths within<br>
the sample for indirectly monitoring glucose concentrations within the body, providing<br>
acceptable energy delivery to the sample site, and providing appropriate<br>
heating/temperature control of the sample site. As discussed below, a fiber optic<br>
collection fiber is placed in the center of this illumination area. This allows the<br>
incident photon approximately 1 mm of radial travel from the point of illumination to<br><br>
the collection fiber. This translates into depths of penetration that probe water, fat,<br>
and protein bands as well as scattering effects that may be used for the indirect<br>
determination of glucose. It is recognized that the dimensions of the aperture need<br>
not be the exact dimensions of the preferred embodiment. An important aspect is<br>
the ability to deliver photons to a skin tissue, allow them to penetrate to depths that<br>
allow an indirect measurement of glucose, and detect those photons.<br>
It is recognized that these properties may be varied without altering the scope and<br>
intent of the invention. For example, the aperture of 2.4 mm may be varied. The<br>
aperture provides an outer limit of where photons from the source may penetrate the<br>
skin. This in turn defines the largest depth of penetration and optical pathlengths<br>
observed. While the aperture may be varied from 1.2 to 5 mm in diameter, the 2.4<br>
mm diameter allows collection of spectra with excellent features for the indirect<br>
measurement of glucose. At smaller apertures, the average depth of penetration of<br>
the collected photons decreases. Therefore, variation of the aperture affects the net<br>
analyte signal of the sampled tissue. Varying aperture shapes are possible as the<br>
shape affects the distribution of photons penetration depth and optical pathlength.<br>
The indirect determination of glucose may be performed off of sample constituents<br>
such as fat, protein, and water that are distributed as a function of depth. Therefore,<br>
the magnitude of the indirect signal varies with the aperture. In addition, multiple<br>
excitation sites and collection sites are possible. This could aid, for example, in<br>
sampling a representative section of the skin. For example, if one probe was located<br>
on a hair follicle, the others may be used independently or in conjunction with the<br>
first site in order to acquire the analytical signal necessary to determine glucose.<br>
Guide<br><br>
In the preferred embodiment, the entire PIM couples into a guide that is semi-<br>
permanently attached to the skin with a replaceable adhesive. The guide aids in<br>
sampling repeatability. The guide is intended to surround interfacing optics for the<br>
purpose of sampling in a precise location. Typically this is done with an interface<br>
surrounding the interface probe. In the main embodiment, the guide is attached for<br>
the waking hours of the subject. A guide may be attached in a more permanent<br>
fashion such as for a week or a month, especially in continuous monitoring glucose<br>
analyzers discussed below. The guide allows improved precision in sampling<br>
location. Precision in sampling location allows bias to be removed if a process such<br>
as mean centering is used in the algorithm. This is addressed in the preprocessing<br>
section below. Additionally, the guide allows for a more constant pressure/constant<br>
displacement to be applied to the sampling location which also enhances precision<br>
and accuracy of the glucose determination. While the guide greatly enhances<br>
positioning and allows associated data processing to be simpler and more robust,<br>
the guide is not an absolute requirement of the sampling module.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, magnets are used to aid in a user<br>
friendly mechanism for coupling the sampling module to the sampled site. Further,<br>
the magnets allow the guide to be reversibly attached to the sampling module.<br>
Further, the guide aids in the optical probe adequately penetrating into the guide<br>
aperture. In addition, the magnets allow a constant, known, and precise alignment<br>
between the sampling probe and the sampled site. In the preferred embodiment two<br>
magnets are used, one on each side of the sampled site, in order to enhance<br>
alignment. One or more magnets may provide the same effect. It is recognized that<br>
there exist a large number of mechanical methods for coupling two devices together,<br>
such as lock and key mechanisms, electro-magnets, machined fits, VELCRO,<br><br>
adhesives, snaps, and many other techniques commonly known to those skilled in<br>
the art that allow the key elements described above to be provided. In addition, the<br>
magnets may be electrically activated to facilitate a controlled movement of the<br>
probe into the guide aperture and to allow, through reversal of the magnet poles, the<br>
probe to be withdrawn from the guide without pulling on the guide.<br>
The guide may optionally contain a window in the aperture that may be the<br>
longpass/bandpass filter. Alternatively, the aperture may be filled with a removable<br>
plug. The contact of a window or plug with the skin stabilizes the tissue by providing<br>
the same tissue displacement as the probe and increases the localized skin surface<br>
and shallow depth hydration. As opposed to the use of a removable plug, use of a<br>
contact window allows a continuous barrier for proper hydration of the sampling site<br>
and a constant pressure interface. The use of a plug or contact window leads to<br>
increased precision and accuracy in glucose determination by the removal of issues<br>
associated with dry or pocketed skin at the sampling site.<br>
The guide may optionally contain any of a number of elements designed to enhance<br>
equilibration between the glucose concentration at the sampling site and a capillary<br>
site, such as the fingertip. Rapidly moving glucose values with time can lead to<br>
significant discrepancies between alternate site blood glucose concentration and<br>
blood glucose concentration in the finger. The concentration differences are directly<br>
related to diffusion and perfusion that combine to limit the rate of the equilibrium<br>
process. Equilibrium between the two sites allows for the use of glucose-related<br>
signal measured at an alternate site to be more accurate in predicting finger blood<br>
glucose values.<br><br>
A number of optional elements may be incorporated into the sampling module and/or<br>
guide to increase sampling precision and to increase the net analyte signal for the<br>
indirect glucose determination. These optional elements are preferably powered<br>
through the base module and connection cable described below but may be battery<br>
operated. Equalization approaches include photonic stimulation, ultrasound<br>
pretreatment, mechanical stimulation, and heating. Notably, equilibration of the<br>
glucose concentration between the sampled site and a well-perfused region such as<br>
an artery or the capillary bed of the fingertip is not required. A minimization of the<br>
difference in glucose concentration between the two regionsl aids in subsequent<br>
glucose determination.<br>
The guide may optionally contain an LED providing photonic stimulation about 890<br>
nm, which is known to induce capillary blood vessel dilation. This technique may be<br>
used to aid in equilibration of alternative site glucose concentrations with those of<br>
capillary blood. By increasing the vessel dilation, and thereby the blood flow rate to<br>
the alternate site, the limiting nature of mass transfer rates and their effect on blood<br>
glucose differences in tissue is minimized. The resulting effect is to reduce the<br>
differences between the finger and the alternate site blood glucose concentrations.<br>
The preferred embodiment uses (nominally) 890 nm LED's in an array with control<br>
electronics set into the arm guide. The LED's can also be used in a continuous<br>
monitoring application where they are located in the probe sensing tip at the tissue<br>
interface. Due to the periods of excitation required for stimulation, the 890 nm LED<br>
is preferably powered by a rechargeable battery in the guide so that the LED may be<br>
powered when the communication bundle is not used.<br>
The guide may optionally contain an apparatus capable of delivering ultrasound<br>
energy into the sample site. Again, this technique may be used to aid in equilibration<br><br>
of alternative site glucose concentrations with those of capillary blood by stimulating<br>
perfusion and/or blood flow.<br>
The guide may optionally contain an apparatus that provides mechanical stimulation<br>
of the sampled site prior to spectral data acquisition. One example is a piezoelectric<br>
modulator than pulses in an out relative to the skin surface a distance of circa 20 to<br>
50 µm in a continuous or duty cycle fashion.<br>
The guide may optionally contain a heating and/or cooling element, such as a strip<br>
heater or an energy transfer pad. Heating is one mechanism of glucose<br>
compartment equilibration. These elements may be used to match the core body<br>
temperature, to manipulate the local perfusion of blood, to avoid sweating and/or to<br>
modify the distribution of fluids among the various tissue compartments.<br>
It is recognized that the sampling module can interface directly to a skin sampling<br>
without the use of a guide.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a coupling fluid is used to efficiently<br>
couple the incident photons into the tissue sample. The preferred coupling fluid is<br>
fluorinert. Different formulations are available including FC-40 and FC-70. FC-40 is<br>
preferred. While many coupling fluids are available for matching refractive indices,<br>
fluorinert is preferred due to its non-toxic nature when applied to skin and due to its<br>
absence of near-IR absorbance bands that would act as interferences. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the coupling fluid is preheated to between 90 and 95°F,<br>
preferably to 92°F. Preheating the coupling fluid minimizes changes to the surface<br>
temperature of the contacted site, thus minimizing spectral changes observed from<br>
the sampled tissue. The coupling fluid may be preheated using the source energy,<br><br>
the optional sample site heater energy, or through an auxiliary heat source.<br>
Preheating FC-70 is preferable due to its poorer viscosity. The preheated FC-70 is<br>
not as likely to run off of the sample site. Automated delivery prior to sampling is an<br>
option. Such a system could be a gated reservoir of fluorinert in the sample module.<br>
Manual delivery of the coupling fluid is also an option, such as a spray bottle delivery<br>
system. Coverage of the sample site is a key criteria in any delivery system.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the sampling site is the dorsal aspect<br>
of the forearm. In addition, the volar and ventral aspect of the forearm are excellent<br>
sampling locations. It is further recognized that the guide may be attached to other<br>
sampling locations such as the hand, fingertips, palmar region, base of thumb,<br>
forearm, upper arm, head, earlobe, chest, torso, abdominal region, thigh, calf, foot,<br>
plantar region, and toes. It is preferable but not required to sample regions of the<br>
skin that do not vary due to usage as with the fingertips or near joints, change with<br>
time due to gravity like the back of the upper arm, or have very thick skin such as the<br>
plantar region, or abdominal region.<br>
There are a number of possible configurations for collection optics. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, light is incident to the sample through the longpass filter which is in<br>
contact with the skin. In the preferred embodiment, there exists a hole in the middle<br>
of the longpass filter. A collection fiber is placed into the hole in contact with the<br>
skin. This configuration forces incident photons into the sampled skin prior to<br>
collection into the fiber optic. If the fiber optic were merely pushed up against the<br>
filter, then light could bounce through the filter directly into the collection fiber without<br>
entering the skin resulting in a spectral reflectance term. Once the collection fiber is<br>
in contact with the skin, the signal (or rather absence of observed intensity) at the<br>
large water absorbance bands near 1450, 1900, and 2500 nm may be used to<br><br>
determine when the apparatus is in good spectral contact with the sampled skin.<br>
The preferred collection optic is a single 600 µm detection fiber. It is recognized that<br>
the hole and the fiber may be altered in dimension to couple in another sized fiber<br>
such as a 300 µm detection fiber. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the fiber<br>
diameter is most efficient when it is optimally optically coupled to the detection<br>
system. Therefore, as detector systems slits and detector element sizes are varied,<br>
the collection optics should also be varied. The center collection fiber of 600 µm<br>
combined with the aperture of 2.4 mm is related to a central fiber collecting incident<br>
light from a bundle. The collection optic is not necessarily limited to a fiber optic.<br>
Additional configurations include but are not limited to a light pipe or a solid piece of<br>
optica] glass.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the collected signal is turned 90° off axis to send the<br>
signal roughly parallel to the arm in order to minimize the height of the sampling<br>
module. This may be accomplished by such common means as a folding mirror or<br>
bending of a fiber optic, as described above.<br>
In one embodiment, the collected light is coupled to a second collection that<br>
connects at its opposite end to the base module. The purpose of this configuration is<br>
to allow the sampling module to be worn on the person without the bulk of the rest of<br>
the spectrometer here referred to as the base module. A quick connect connector is<br>
used to allow rapid connection of the base module to the sampling module in a<br>
reproducible and user friendly fashion. The connecting cable carries at least the<br>
optical signal. In the preferred embodiment, the connection cable also carries power<br>
to the source and optional elements, such as the thermistor, heater, or sample<br>
compartment glucose concentration equilibration apparatus. This connector also<br>
allows the diameter of the collection fiber to be changed. For example, the 600 µm<br><br>
collection fiber may be downsized to a 300 µm connection fiber with appropriate<br>
attention to coupling optics and numerical apertures obvious to those skilled in the<br>
art. Some advantages of the smaller diameter connection fiber are described here.<br>
First, the smaller diameter fiber has a tighter bend radius. Second, if a slit is used<br>
prior to the spectrometer then the fiber can be made of appropriate dimension for<br>
coupling to the slit. Third, the smaller diameter fiber is less susceptible to breakage.<br>
An additional consideration is cost.<br>
It is recognized that collection/detection elements may be recessed away from the<br>
window in order to avoid the direct detection of surface reflectance. It is further<br>
recognized that coupling fluids may be used to increase the angle of collection to the<br>
detection element.<br>
Base Module<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the base module includes at least a spectrometer<br>
(grating and detector system). The grating is optimized to deliver peak energy about<br>
1600 nm. The detector is an InGaAs array covering the range of 1100 to 1900 nm.<br>
A main purpose of the spectrometer is wavelength separation and detection.<br>
Variations in the grating/detector system are readily understood by those skilled in<br>
the art.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, a broadband source is combined with a detector array<br>
without the use of a dispersive element. In one case, filters are placed in from the<br>
detectors. One type of filter are thin dielectric films, such as in Fabry-Perot<br>
interference filters. These filters may be placed into a linear, bundle, or rectangular<br>
pattern depending upon how the light is coupled to the detector. For example, a slit<br><br>
may be used in conjunction with a rectangular array of filters and detectors.<br>
Alternatively, a fiber may be used in conjunction with a bundle of filters and<br>
associated detectors. Another type of filter is a linear variable filter. For example, a<br>
linear variable filter may sit in from of a linear array of filters. Many variations on<br>
these optical layouts are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The Power/Control Module may be coupled to the user's belt or other location other<br>
than the measurement site. In an alternate embodiment the patient interface module<br>
contains a battery and two-way wireless communication system. In this<br>
configuration the Control/Power module may be carried by the patient. For example,<br>
a handheld computer or Palm computing platform can be equipped with a two-way<br>
wireless communication system for receiving data from the patient interface module<br>
and sending instructions. The computer system then provides the system with<br>
analysis capabilities.<br>
In an alternate embodiment the base module contains a battery and two-way<br>
wireless communication system. In this configuration the Control/Power module is<br>
contained a remote location that is either carried by the patient or not. For example,<br>
a handheld computer or Palm computing platform can be equipped with a two-way<br>
wireless communication system for receiving data from the patient interface module<br>
and sending instructions. The computer system then provides the system with<br>
analysis capabilities.<br>
The Control/Power Module contains the control electronics, power system, batteries,<br>
embedded computer and interface electronics. Control electronics provide a means<br>
for initiating events from the embedded or attached computer system and interfacing<br>
the detector electronics (amplifiers) which provide a voltage that is related to the<br><br>
detected light intensity. Digitizing the detected voltage through the use of an analog-<br>
to-digital converter is performed. The signals detected are used to form a spectrum<br>
which is represents the diffusely reflected and detected light intensity versus<br>
wavelength. In addition, historical measurements are made available through a<br>
display and/or an external communication port to a computer or computer system,<br>
e.g. a Palmtop. In an alternate embodiment, the measurement and ancillary<br>
information is transferred to a remote display and receiving unit, such as a handheld<br>
computer or stand-alone display module through a wireless communication. In this<br>
latter system, a display and receiving unit may be incorporated into a watch, pen,<br>
personal desktop assistance, cell phone, or blood glucose monitoring device.<br>
Spectrometer<br>
It is here noted, that variation of one component may affect optimal or preferred<br>
characteristics of other components. For example, variation in the source may affect<br>
the quality or design of the. reflector, the thickness of the filter, the used aperture<br>
size, the time or power requirements for maintaining or heating the skin and/or<br>
fluorinert, and the diameter of the collection fiber. Similarly, changing another<br>
component such as the collection fiber diameter impacts the other elements. Those<br>
skilled in the art will appreciate the interaction of these elements. Those skilled in<br>
the art will also immediately appreciate that one or more components of the<br>
spectrometer may be changed without altering the scope of the invention.<br>
Important regions to detect are permutations and combinations of bands due to<br>
water centered about 1450, 1900, or 2600 nm, protein bands centered about 1180,<br>
1280, 1690, 1730, 2170, or 2285 nm, fat bands centered about 1210, 1675, 1715,<br><br>
1760, 2130, 2250, or 2320 nm, or glucose bands centered about 1590, 1730, 2150,<br>
and 2272 nm.<br>
A preferred physical orientation of the spectrometer is in a vertical position. For<br>
example, when sampling on the dorsal aspect of the forearm when the palm is face<br>
down on a support it is preferable for the sampling module to come down onto the<br>
arm from above. This allows the weight of the sampling module to be reproducible.<br>
Standards<br>
Near-infrared devices are composed of optical and mechanical components that vary<br>
due to manufacturing tolerances, vary in optical alignment, and change with time due<br>
to mechanical factors such as wear and strain, and environmental factors such as<br>
temperature variation. This results in changes in the x-axis of a given spectrometer<br>
with time as well as instrument-to-instrument variation. When a calibration model is<br>
used to extract information about a sample, such as the glucose concentration in the<br>
body, these instrument related changes result in wavelength uncertainty that reduces<br>
the accessibility of the signal related to the property of interest. These variations<br>
also degrades the device accuracy when a calibration model is transferred from one<br>
instrument to another.<br>
A system for standardizing the wavelength axis of near-IR optical systems that<br>
measures light at a multiplicity of wavelengths is described in this section. The<br>
preferred embodiment is that presented in Figure 2. The system described in this<br>
section may be used with the instrument configurations described in the remainder of<br>
this document. The spectrometer system detects the transmitted or reflected near-<br>
infrared radiation from the sample within a specified wavelength range and the<br><br>
analyzer determines the absorbance at various wavelengths after a standardization<br>
procedure. Methods for standardizing the x-axis of a spectrometer based system<br>
rely on a comparative analysis of a master and slave spectra of a standardization<br>
material. A material with absorption bands in the targeted wavelength region is used<br>
for determining the x-axis. Typically, the reference or standard absorbance bands<br>
are reasonably sharp, stable, and distributed across the wavelength region of<br>
interest (1100 to 1900 nm). Common materials for this purpose are polystyrene,<br>
erbium oxide, dysprosium oxide, and holmium oxide though a large number of<br>
plastics may be used. Internal polystyrene has been used as a reference in the<br>
FOSS, formerly NIRSystems spectrometers. However, in these systems, polystyrene<br>
is used in conjunction with an actuated rotating grating and a single detector. In the<br>
preferred embodiment of this invention no actuated grating is used.<br>
The material used for standardization may be measured external to the spectrometer<br>
system with an external mounting system. However, the material mounted in a<br>
separate standard mounting system external to the spectrometer must be placed on<br>
the device by the user at designated time periods. This process is subject to<br>
positioning error and increases the complexity of the measurement protocol from the<br>
standpoint of the user. This is particularly a problem in consumer oriented devices,<br>
such as non-invasive glucose sensors, in which the user may not be technically<br>
oriented.<br>
Alternatively, the reference may be continuously mounted internal to the instrument<br>
in a separate light path. In this configuration, the internal wavelength standard may<br>
be measured simultaneously with the sample. Alternatively, the reference may be<br>
moved through an actuator into the main optical train at an appropriate time,<br>
optionally in an automated process. In either of these systems, the reference<br><br>
spectrum may be collected in transmittance of reflectance mode. However, it is<br>
preferable to collected an external reference in diffuse reflectance mode. For<br>
example a polystyrene disk placed at an angle to the incident light to minimize<br>
specular reflectance may be backed by a reflector such as a Labsphere reference.<br>
For an internal reference, a similar arrangement may be used, but a transmittance<br>
spectrum is preferred.<br>
The wavelength standardization system includes associated methods for<br>
measurement of a reference spectrum and a (wavelength) standardization spectrum<br>
through the spectroscopic measurement of a non-absorbing material and a material<br>
with known and immutable spectral absorbance bands respectively. The spectrum<br>
of the standardization material is used in-conjunction with an associated method for<br>
standardizing the x-axis of sample spectra that are collected subsequently. The<br>
method includes a master spectrum of the standardization material and a method for<br>
determining the discrepancy between the master and instrument standardization<br>
spectrum. The master spectrum and the wavelength regions are stored in<br>
nonvolatile memory of the instrument computer system. One method of calculating<br>
the phase difference or x-axis shift between the master and slave spectra is through<br>
the use of cross correlation. For example, one or more windows across the<br>
spectrum the x-axis phase shift between the master and acquired spectrum are<br>
determined through a cross-correlation function after removing instrument related<br>
baseline variations. The phase shift is used to correct (standardize) the x-axis of the<br>
acquired spectrum to the master spectrum. Other approaches include interpolation<br>
or wavelet transformation.<br>
Preprocessing<br><br>
After conversion of the photons into intensity and optionally absorbance units,<br>
preprocessing occurs. The detected spectrum may be processed through multiple<br>
preprocessing steps including outlier analysis, standardization, absorbance<br>
calculation, filtering, correction, and application to a linear or nonlinear model for<br>
generation of an estimate (measurement) of the targeted analyte or constituent<br>
which is displayed to the user.<br>
Of particular note is the preprocessing step of bias correcting the spectral data<br>
collected in one or both of the X (spectra) and Y (glucose concentration) data. In<br>
particular, the first scan of a day may have a reference glucose concentration<br>
associated with it. This glucose concentration may be used as a bias correction for<br>
glucose determinations collected until subsequent calibration. Similarly, the first<br>
spectrum of the day may be used to adjust calibration components from the X block.<br>
Notably, the guide allows the same sampling location to be obtained until the guide<br>
is removed. This directly impacts the use of the first spectrum and reference glucose<br>
concentration to adjust the model in terms of preprocessing and subsequent model<br>
application.<br>
Additional preprocessing techniques are covered in the introductory section. These<br>
techniques are well understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
Modeling<br>
Subsequent data analysis may include a soft model or a calibration such as PCR or<br>
PLS. Many other modes of data analysis exist such as neural networks. A method<br>
has been invented for calibrating the device to an individual or a group of individuals<br><br>
based upon a calibration data set. The calibration data set is comprised of paired<br>
data points of processed spectral measurements and reference biological parameter<br>
values. For example, in the case of glucose measurement, the reference values are<br>
one or more of the following: finger capillary blood glucose, alternate site capillary<br>
blood glucose, i.e. a site on the body other than the finger, interstitial glucose or<br>
venous blood glucose. The calibration data is subject to optimal sample selection to<br>
remove outliers, data correlating to ancillary factors and data with excessive<br>
variation. Spectral measurements are preprocessed prior to calibration through<br>
filtering and scattering correction and normalized to a background template collected<br>
each time the guide system is attached to the skin tissue. Measurements are<br>
performed after preprocessing data collected subsequent to calibration as discussed<br>
above through the calibration or model to measure the variation of the biological<br>
parameter relative to its value at the time the guide was attached. The scope of<br>
these techniques was addressed in the prior art section and are well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Results of a study using a noninvasive glucose analyzer are presented here. The<br>
study used a custom built noninvasive near-IR glucose analyzer. The analyzer is<br>
conceptually as presented in the preferred embodiment with components including a<br>
tungsten halogen source, a back-reflector, a bandpass optical filter, a fiber optic<br>
illumination bundle, a guide, a fluorinert coupling fluid, a guide, an aperture, a<br>
forearm sampling site, a collection fiber, a slit, a dispersive grating, and an InGaAs<br>
array detector though the spectrometer was larger in overall dimensions than in the<br>
preferred embodiment. However, the miniaturized sampling module has been<br>
demonstrated to deliver equivalent energy to the sample site. A calibration model<br>
was built. A subsequent prediction data set was initiated two weeks after all<br><br>
parameters were fixed in the calibration model. Subsequent prediction data<br>
(spectra) were collected with two spectrometers on seven people over a period of<br>
seven weeks. Preprocessing included a Savitsky-Golay first derivative with 27<br>
points and mean centering. A PLS model was applied with a fifteen factor model to<br>
the resulting data over a range of 1200 to 1800 nm. A total of 976 glucose<br>
determinations were made. The outlier analysis program was automated. The<br>
results are presented in Figure 7 in a concentration correlation plot overlaid with a<br>
Clarke error grid. Overall, 99.9% of the glucose predictions fell into the 'A' or 'B'<br>
region of the Clarke error grid. These glucose predictions are considered clinically<br>
accurate.<br>
Docking Station<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the base module is integrally connected to the docking<br>
station. In addition to the grating, detector assembly, and power supply, the docking<br>
station includes a computer and a glucose management center. The glucose<br>
management system may keep track of events occurring in time such as glucose<br>
intake, insulin delivery, and determined glucose concentration. These may be<br>
graphed with time or exported to exterior devices, such as a doctor's computer.<br>
A process is provided for estimating the precision of the measurement through a<br>
statistical analysis of repeated or successive measurements. A method is<br>
implemented for determining when the biological parameter is close to a preset level<br>
through a statistical estimate of the confidence limits of a future analyte prediction.<br>
The prediction is made through a simple slope, e.g. change in the biological<br>
parameter over the change in time, estimate based on an exponentially moving<br>
average and the confidence limits are based upon the estimate of precision.<br><br>
Alternately, the prediction is made through a standard time series analysis. An alarm<br>
is invoked if the associated present alarm level is within the confidence interval of a<br>
future biological parameter prediction. This process is used, for example, to detect<br>
the potential for hypoglycemia in diabetics in the near future, e.g. within 10-30<br>
minutes. In addition, the process is used to detect potential outliers through a<br>
determination of the statistical consistency of a particular measurement with its<br>
expected value.<br>
Continuous/Semi-Continuous Glucose Determination<br>
Continuous or semi-continuous measurements may be taken when the sampling<br>
module is in contact with the sampling site. Measurements of a biological parameter<br>
that are made at short intervals relative to the change in the biological parameter<br>
such that the measurement process is continuous. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
measurements may be made every six seconds. Realistically, the glucose<br>
concentration does not change to a measurable level within six seconds. Therefore,<br>
readings taken at a less frequent interval such as every 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, or 60<br>
minutes can be made. Readings taken at this interval are still referred to as<br>
continuous and/or semi-continuous. The continuous readings may be performed in<br>
an automated fashion.<br>
It is noted that when the biological parameter is slowly varying, the guide can remain<br>
attached to the individual while the rest of the system is intermittently attached at<br>
particular intervals to make continuous or semi-continuous readings.<br><br>
An element of the invention is the use of the time based information and trends to<br>
perform other functions such as estimate of the precision, confidence intervals and<br>
prediction of future events.<br>

In circumstances in which the Control/Power module can be secured without<br>
disturbing the sample site the two modules are merged into one that are attached to<br>
the subject through the guide interface system. Finally, when the biological<br>
parameter is slowly varying, the guide can remain attached to the individual while the<br>
rest of the system is intermittently attached at particular intervals.<br><br>
A link is disclosed to an insulin delivery system. When the monitored biological<br>
parameter is glucose, a link is provided to an insulin delivery system to provide a<br>
feedback mechanism for control purposes. The link is either a direct or a wireless<br>
connection. In addition, a communication system is provided for transmitting the<br>
patient's monitored glucose levels to his physician.<br>
AN ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
As in the preferred embodiment, a primary alternative embodiment of the invention<br>
includes two main modules: a sampling module and base module connected though<br>
a communication bundle. The modules are as described in the preferred<br>
embodiment with the exception of the source and the associated wavelength<br>
selection/detection components. In the alternative embodiment of the invention, the<br>
spectrometer system uses LEDs to both provide near-infrared radiation to the<br>
sample and to perform wavelength selection over predefined wavelength ranges.<br>
This embodiment has the significant advantage of not requiring a dispersive element<br>
or interferometer based system for the purpose of wavelength selection. Rather,<br>
each LED provides near-infrared radiation over a band of wavelengths and thereby<br>
gives the necessary means for wavelength selection.<br>
The wavelengths of the LEDs are selected specifically to optimize the signal-to-noise<br>
ratio of the net analyte signal of the target analyte and are arranged at various<br>
distances with respect to the detection elements to provide a means for sampling<br>
various tissue volumes for the purpose of averaging and the determination of a<br>
differential measurement. The LEDs are sequentially energized one at a time and/or<br>
in groups to obtain various estimates of the diffuse reflectance of various tissue<br>
volumes at specific wavelengths or bands of wavelengths. In addition, the LEDs can<br><br>
be pulsed to provide short measurements with high signal-to-noise ratios. This<br>
provides greater illumination intensity, while avoiding photo heating of the sampled<br>
tissue volume. Alternately, the LEDs can be modulated at a particular duty cycle and<br>
frequency to provide a means for removing additive noise and simultaneous<br>
measurement of multiple wavelengths.<br>
The wavelengths of the LED(s) are selected specifically to optimize the signal-to-<br>

sampled tissue volume. Alternately, the LEDs can be modulated at a particular duty<br>
cycle and frequency to provide a means for removing additive noise and<br>
simultaneous measurement of multiple wavelengths.<br>
With an LED source, the remainder of the spectrometer remains as in the preferred<br>
embodiment and its species. For example, the LED's may be stabilized with control<br>
electronics, optics may be used to guide the source intensity to the sampled<br>
aperture, a guide may be used, a coupling fluid may be used, temperature<br>
stabilization of the source and or sample may be used, collection optics integrate<br>
with the sampled skin directly, a communication bundle may be employed, and a<br>
base module is used with or without a docking station. As in the preferred<br>
embodiment, the detector may stare directly at the tissue.<br><br>
Embodiments<br>
A number of instrument configurations of the alternative embodiment are presented<br>
below. Those skilled in the art will recognize that permutations and combinations of<br>
these embodiments are possible.<br>
In the simplest embodiment, the LEDs may illuminate the sample directly, as in<br>
Figure 8. In Figure 8, a coupling fluid 84, as disclosed above, is shown provides<br>
between the device and the tissue sample. An optional mixing chamber with a<br>
reflective surface may be used between the LEDs 80 and the optical window 81 to<br>
provide a nearly uniform distribution onto the tissue region 82 surrounding the<br>
detection fiber 83. A spacer 85 may also be provided between the fiber and the<br>
LEDs. In this embodiment, the LEDs are designed with a bandwidth enabling the<br>
measurement, and the LEDs are arranged in a manner that allows the sampling and<br>
detection of a particular tissue volume at a particular band of wavelengths. Each<br>
LED may be recessed into a material 91 having a reflective surface 90 as shown in<br>
Figure 9.<br>
In this scenario, two arrangements are used. First, a mixing chamber is present as<br>
shown in Figure 8 with the filter inserted in the place of the optical window. This<br>
allows the LED's to be used in much the same way as a broadband source.<br>
Second, the illumination-to-detection distance may be used for measurement<br>
purposes so the mixing chamber is removed and the LEDs are put in close proximity<br>
or even touching the overall sampling site via optional filters. In this second mode,<br>
the distance from the illumination spot of the LED to the collection optics is known.<br>
This allows the average depth of penetration of the photons and average pathlength<br><br>
to be known. This allows wavelength dependent scanning of depth and radial<br>
variation from the collection spot, and allows wavelength specific information to be<br>
used in an indirect reading of the glucose concentration.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, groups of LEDs (Figure 10; 100) are employed with<br>
each group associated with a single filter type, more than one physical filter may be<br>
necessary. The LEDs are arranged at distances surrounding the detection fiber and<br>
energized "according to a strategy enabling the detection of light associated with<br>
different wavelength bands and different illumination to detection distances (se e<br>
Figure 10). In one embodiment (Figure 10a) the groups of LEDs are arranged in<br>
annuli (rings) at specific distances surrounding the detection fiber. The filters are<br>
arranged in rings surrounding the detection fiber and covering the associated LEDs.<br>
Each annular ring of the filter may have its own filter characteristics. In a second<br>
arrangement (Figure 10b), groups of LEDs are arranged in wedges surrounding the<br>
detection fiber. In the second embodiment the filters may be of a wedged or<br>
triangular shape and are arranged to cover their associated LEDs. Each wedge filter<br>
may have its own filter characteristics.<br>
In another embodiment, each LED or group of LEDs has an associated optical filter<br>
that is used to limit the bandwidth of emitted light. A different filter is mounted such<br>
that the light emitted and delivered to the sample from the LED passes through the<br>
filter. The filter associated with an LED is designed with a specific bandwidth and is<br>
centered on a particular wavelength that is within the native bandwidth of the LED.<br>
To provide for a broader illumination pattern or to increase the light energy delivered<br>
to the sample, groups of LEDs can be associated with the same filter. Through<br>
alternate energization of the LEDs or by modulating each LED or LED group at<br>
different frequencies (and demodulating after detection), narrow wavelength bands<br><br>
on the order of 5-100 nm can be distinguished and measured through a single<br>
element detector.<br>
In another embodiment, the LEDs have a bandwidth relatively broader than the net<br>
analyte and interference signals. The light collected by the detection fiber is passed<br>
through a slit and imaged onto dispersive element which disperses the band of<br>
detected light onto an array of detector elements. In this configuration, optical filters<br>
on the LEDs are not employed.<br>
In another embodiment, the LED's are used in a spectrometer without a dispersive<br>
element and a single element detector. In one case, thin dielectric films are used as<br>
in Fabry-Perot interference filters. A filter is associated with each LED. In a second<br>
case, an interferometer composed of two parallel, highly reflecting plates separated<br>
by an air gap may be used. One of the parallel plates may be translated<br>
mechanically such that the distance between the plates varies. Technically, this is a<br>
Fabry-Perot interferometer. When the mirror distance is fixed and adjusted for<br>
parallelism by a spacer such as invar or quartz, the system is referred to as a Fabry-<br>
Perot etalon. Both cases allow narrow excitation lines and may be used by<br>
sequentially firing the LED's as above.<br>
A number of spectrometer configurations are possible for this measurement as are<br>
outlined above. Basically the spectroscopic measurement system includes a source<br>
of near-infrared radiation, a wavelength selection system, an interface to the patient,<br>
photon guiding optics, and a detector.<br>
