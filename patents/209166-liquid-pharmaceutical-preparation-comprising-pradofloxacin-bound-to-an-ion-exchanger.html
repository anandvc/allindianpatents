COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"LIQUID PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATION COMPRISING PRADOFLOXACIN BOUND TO AN ION EXCHANGER"<br>
BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organized under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
Le, A 36 165-Foreign Countries<br>
5 The present invention relates to pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration, comprising one or more active substances bound to an ion exchanger. In order to improve physical stability and acceptance, particularly in animals, a pseudoplastic gel-former thickener is included.<br>
10   It has long been known to bind active pharmaceutical substances to ion exchange resins in order to make it easier to administer, for example, active substances with a pronounced inherent odour (CH 383 552). It is also known to bind active pharmaceutical substances to ion exchange resins in order to effect uniform release of the active substance over a prolonged period (DE 30 28 082). It is additionally<br>
15 known to bind active anthelmintic substances to ion exchange resins in order to influence the taste of the active substances (DE 30 28 082). By binding to ion exchange resins it is also possible to mask the bitter taste of quinolone antibiotics, so permitting administration to animals (EP-A-295 495).<br>
20 The abovementioned text describes formulations of bitter-tasting quinolone-carboxylic acid derivatives which are bound to ion exchange resins, and their production. The ion exchange resins in question include weakly acidic cationic types, whose matrix may be gel-like or macroporous. Suitable base monomers for the ion exchangers are polymerizable monomers which by means of appropriate side chains<br>
25 may be functionalized to give cation exchange resins. The ion exchangers are known under the trade names Lewatit®, Amberlite®, Purolite® or Dowex®. Corresponding formulations have been described in veterinary medicine as feed medicaments for pigs.<br>
30 The often unfavourable surface texture of ion exchangers frequently leads to severe caking of the sediment following settling of the particles in liquid suspensions.<br><br><br>
Le A 36 165 - Foreign Countries<br>
Our patent application WO 03/007995 describes the stabilization of such ion exchangers by grinding so that at least 90% of the particles are smaller than 50 um. Probably as a result of rounding-off of the irregular surface, the sediments formed are then easily reagitated. Grinding operations of this kind, however, are very 5 laborious and make the production of such preparations significantly more expensive.<br>
It is also known to solidify pharmaceutical preparations by using gel formers (e.g. hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxymethylpropylcellulose) to 10 such an extent that sedimentation is no longer able to take place. However, semisolid preparations of this kind no longer flow under the force of their own weight. It is difficult to realize liquid pharmaceutical forms with such preparations.<br>
It is known, moreover, that liquid, aqueous suspensions of ion exchange resins can 15     be stabilized using pseudoplastic gel formers (e.g. polyacrylic acid, xanthan, tragacanth, Na carboxymethylcellulose, bentonite). For instance, US 6 146 622 and US 2 002 035 154 describe aqueous suspensions of a cation exchanger which are stabilized with polyacrylic acid (Carbopol 974 P) or xanthan. US 5 612 026 describes a drink mix which comprises an anion exchanger and xanthan. Balkus et al. 20     (Langmuir,   12,  6277-6281   (1996))  publicized  the  stabilizing  of gadolinium-containing hectorite suspensions with xanthan. Further descriptions of aqueous ion exchange suspensions stabilized against sedimentation using pseudoplastic polymers can be found in JP 05 279 245, JP 05 279 246, Sprockel et al., Drug Dev. Ind. Pharm. 15,1275-1287 (1989), EP 139 881, JP 01 071 823, JP 01 071 822 and JP 63 230 636. 25     In a state of rest suspensions of this kind possess a high viscosity, thereby preventing sedimentation of the suspended ion exchanger particles. Under the effect of force, the system liquefies and so can easily be pumped or sprayed.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that suspensions of an ion exchanger with active 30 substance loading that have been thickened with a pseudoplastic polymer have a particularly good mouthfeel and are very well accepted and tolerated after oral administration. Such suspensions, moreover, are stable to sedimentation of the solid constituents and have advantageous flow properties desirable in a composition for<br><br><br>
Le A 36 165 - Foreign Countries<br><br>
oral administration. After absorption in the stomach the active pharmaceutical substance is rapidly detached from the ion exchanger. There is therefore little change in the pharmacokinetic profile as compared with unbound active substance.<br>
5     The invention accordingly provides:<br>
•	A pharmaceutical preparation comprising one or more active substances bound to<br>
an ion exchanger, characterized in that the loaded ion exchanger is dispersed in a<br>
carrier medium which comprises at least one pseudoplastic gel former.<br>
10<br>
•	The use of pharmaceutical preparations comprising ion exchangers loaded with<br>
active substances and at least one pseudoplastic gel former, especially in<br>
veterinary medicine.<br>
15 Examples of pseudoplastic gel formers which can be used include microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose ethers (methylcellulose, hydroxyethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl-cellulose, methylhydroxypropylcellulose, Na carboxymethylcellulose), xanthan, tragacanth, guar gum, gum arabic, starch and starch derivatives such as Na carboxy-methyl starch, gelatin, highly disperse silica (e.g.  Aerosil), polyacyrylic acid,<br>
20 aluminium stearate or bentonite. It is also possible to combine the stated gel formers with one another.<br>
Highly disperse silica finds preferred use in the thickening of non-aqueous carrier liquids. For the thickening of aqueous carrier liquids it is preferred to use 25 microcrystalline cellulose, cellulose ethers, xanthan, polyacrylic acid and bentonite or mixtures of the stated gel formers. Particular preference is given in this context to the use of microcrystalline cellulose, Na carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan, polyacrylic acid and bentonite.<br>
30 The ion exchange resins may have, for example, a gel-like or macroporous matrix. Suitable base monomers for the ion exchangers include polymerizable monomers which by means of appropriate functionalization can be converted into ion exchange resins. Examples of suitable monomers include (meth)acrylates, (meth)acrylonitrile<br><br><br>
Le A 36 165 - Foreign Countries<br><br>
and styrene derivatives. Further comonomers used to prepare the base polymers include polyvinyl compounds such as divinylbenzene, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate or methylenebisacrylamide, for example. Condensation resins which lead to ion exchangers are also suitable, examples being phenol-formaldehyde resins with 5      appropriate functional groups.<br>
The ion exchangers which can be used are known. Further details of various ion exchanger types and their preparation can be found, for example, in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry (Release 2001, 6th Edition). The preferred<br>
10 macroporous resins may have different pore volumes. The degree of crosslinking of the suitable ion exchange resins should preferably be up to 20% and with particular preference up to 12%. The synthetic resins usually have particle sizes of from 1 to 300 um, preferably from 10 to 200 urn. Examples of customary commercial ion exchange resins are Lewatit®, Amberlite®, Dowex® and Purolite®.<br>
15<br>
To bind basic or cationic active substances it is possible to use acidic ion exchangers.<br>
Strongly acidic ion exchangers used are preferably those based on poly(styrene, divinylbenzene)sulphonic acid. Examples that may be mentioned include: 20<br>

As weakly acidic cation exchangers, use is made especially of those based on 5     methacrylic acid-divinylbenzene copolymers. Examples include:<br>
•	Amberlite IRP 64: methacrylic acid-divinylbenzene copolymer in H form; usual<br>

Flupirtin can also be used in the form of its pharmaceutically usable salts, preferably salts with acids, for example the hydrochloride or the maleate. 5<br>
The ion exchange resins are loaded with active substance in water or polar organic solvents, such as alcohols, for example, such as propylene glycol or ethanol, glycerol, ketones, such as acetone, or mixtures thereof. Water and also alcohol/water mixtures are particularly preferred. Ion exchanger and active substance are stirred in 10 the medium at room temperature or elevated temperature until the active substance is fully bound. The loading of the ion exchanger with active substance and the formulation of the pharmaceutical can also take place in one step.<br>
Where the ion exchanger laden with active substance is to be dispersed in a lipophilic 15 carrier medium which is immiscible with water and/or polar solvent it must first be separated from the aqueous loading medium and dried. Subsequently the loaded ion exchanger can be incorporated into the carrier medium. As a lipophilic carrier medium it is possible for example to use fatty oils, paraffin oils or silicone oils.
