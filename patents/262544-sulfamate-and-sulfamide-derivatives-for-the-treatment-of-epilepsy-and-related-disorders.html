SULFAMATE AND  SULFAMIDE  DERIVATIVES  FOR THE  TREATMENT  OF  EPILEPSY AND  RELATED  DI BORDERS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims the benefit of U. S. Provisional Application 60/580,178, filed on June 16, 2004, which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to novel sulfamate and sulfamide derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and their use in the treatment of epilepsy and related disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Epilepsy describes a condition in which a person has recurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. Epilepsy refers to a clinical phenomenon rather than a single disease entity, since there are many forms and causes of epilepsy. Using a definition of epilepsy as two or more unprovoked seizures, the incidence of epilepsy is estimated at approximately 0.3 to 0.5 percent in different populations throughout the world, with the prevalence of epilepsy estimated at 5 to 10 people per 1000.<br>
An essential step in the evaluation and management of a patient with a seizure is to determine the type of seizure that has occurred. The main characteristic that distinguishes the different categories of seizures is whether the seizure activity is partial (synonymous with focal) or generalized.<br>
Partial seizures are those in which the seizure activity is restricted to discrete areas of the cerebral cortex. If consciousness is fully preserved during the seizure, the clinical manifestations are considered relatively simple and the seizure is termed a simple-partial seizure. If consciousness is impaired, the<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
seizure is termed a complex-partial seizure. An important additional subgroup comprises those seizures that begin as partial seizures and then spread diffusely throughout the cortex, which are known as partial seizures with secondary generalization.<br>
Generalized seizures involve diffuse regions of the brain simultaneously in a bilaterally symmetric fashion. Absence or petit mal seizures are characterized by sudden, brief lapses of consciousness without loss of postural control. Atypical absence seizures typically include a longer duration in the lapse of consciousness, less abrupt onset and cessation, and more obvious motor signs that may include focal or lateralizing features. Generalized Tonic-clonic or grand mal seizures, the main type of generalized seizures, are characterized by abrupt onset, without warning. The initial phase of the seizure is usually tonic contraction of muscles, impaired respiration, a marked enhancement of sympathetic tone leading to increased heart rate, blood pressure, and pupillary size. After 10-20 s, the tonic phase of the seizure typically evolves into the clonic phase, produced by the superimposition of periods of muscle relaxation on the tonic muscle contraction. The periods of relaxation progressively increase until the end of the ictal phase, which usually lasts no more than 1 min. The postictal phase is characterized by unresponsiveness, muscular flaccidity, and excessive salivation that can cause stridorous breathing and partial airway obstruction. Atonic seizures are characterized by sudden loss of postural muscle tone lasting 1-2 s. Consciousness is briefly impaired, but there is usually no postictal confusion. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by a sudden and brief muscle contraction that may involve one part of the body or the entire body. (www.harrisonsonline.com, March 29, 2001)<br>
Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) have been widely used in medicine, mainly as antiglaucoma and antisecretory drugs or diuretic agents, and are valuable compounds. However, systemic antiglaucoma agents (such as acetazolamide) possess potentially unwanted side-effects including paresthesias,<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
nephrolithiasis and weight loss. Topiramate is a well known anticonvulsant drug that possesses single digit micromolar carbonic anhydrase inhibition, which is suspected as the cause of paresthesias noted by some patients taking topiramate.<br>
There remains a need to provide an effective treatment for epilepsy and related disorders, and preferably treatment which does not have the associated side-effects attributable to carbonic anhydrase inhibition.<br>

WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
As used herein, unless otherwise noted, "alkoxy" shall denote an oxygen ether radical of the above described straight or branched chain alkyl groups. For example, methoxy, ethoxy, n-propoxy, sec-butoxy, t-butoxy, n-hexyloxy and the like.<br>
As used herein, the notation "*" shall denote the presence of a stereogenic center.<br>
When a particular group is "substituted" (e.g., alkyl, aryl, etc.), that group may have one or more substituents, preferably from one to five substituents, more preferably from one to three substituents, most preferably from one to two substituents, independently selected from the list of substituents.<br>
With reference to substituents, the term "independently" means that when more than one of such substituents is possible, such substituents may be the same or different from each other.<br>
Under standard nomenclature used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first, followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment.

encephalopathy, phenylketonuria, juvenile Gaucher's disease, Lundborg's progressive myoclonic epilepsy, stroke, head trauma, stress, hormonal changes, drug use or withdrawal, alcohol use or withdrawal, sleep deprivation, and the like), essential tremor, restless limb syndrome, and the like. Preferably, the disorder is selected from epilepsy (regardless of type, underlying cause or origin), essential tremor or restless limb syndrome, more preferably, the disorder is epilepsy (regardless of type, underlying cause or origin) or essential tremor.<br>
The term "subject" as used herein, refers to an animal, preferably a mammal, most preferably a human, who is or has been the object of treatment, observation or experiment.<br>
The term "therapeutically effective amount" as used herein, means that amount of active compound or pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal response in a tissue system, animal or human that is being sought by a researcher, veterinarian, medical doctor or other clinician, which includes alleviation of the symptoms of the disease or disorder being treated.<br>
As used herein, the term "composition" is intended to encompass a product comprising the specified ingredients in the specified amounts, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combinations of the specified ingredients in the specified amounts.<br>
Where the compounds according to this invention have at least one chiral center, they may accordingly exist as enantiomers. Where the compounds possess two or more chiral centers, they may additionally exist as diastereomers. It is to be understood that all such isomers and mixtures thereof are encompassed within the scope of the present invention. Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for the compounds may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds may form solvates with water (i.e., hydrates) or common organic<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
solvents, and such solvates are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
Where the processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixture of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques such as preparative chromatography. The compounds may be prepared in racemicform, or individual enantiomers may be prepared either by enantiospecific synthesis or by resolution. The compounds may, for example, be resolved into their component enantiomers by standard techniques, such as the formation of diastereomeric pairs by salt formation with an optically active acid, such as (-)-di-p-toluoyl-D-tartaric acid and/or (+)-di-p-toluoyl-L-tartaric acid followed by fractional crystallization and regeneration of the free base. The compounds may also be resolved by formation of diastereomeric esters or amides, followed by chromatographic separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary. Alternatively, the compounds may be resolved using a chiral HPLC column.<br>
During any of the processes for preparation of the compounds of the present invention, it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991. The protecting groups may be removed at a convenient subsequent stage using methods known from the art.<br>
The present invention includes within its scope prodrugs of the compounds of this invention. In general, such prodrugs will be functional derivatives of the compounds which are readily convertible in vivo into the required compound. Thus, in the methods of treatment of the present invention, the term "administering" shall encompass the treatment of the various disorders<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
described with the compound specifically disclosed or with a compound which may not be specifically disclosed, but which converts to the specified compound in vivo after administration to the patient. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable prodrug derivatives are described, for example, in Design of Prodrugs. ed. H. Bundgaard, Elsevier, 1985.<br>
The present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of formula (I), a compound of formula (II) and / or a compound of formula (III) in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Preferably these compositions are in unit dosage forms such as tablets, pills, capsules, powders, granules, sterile parenteral solutions or suspensions, metered aerosol or liquid sprays, drops, ampoules, autoinjector devices or suppositories; for oral parenteral, intranasal, sublingual or rectal administration, or for administration by inhalation or insufflation. Alternatively, the composition may be presented in a form suitable for once-weekly or once-monthly administration; for example, an insoluble salt of the active compound, such as the decanoate salt, may be adapted to provide a depot preparation for intramuscular injection. For preparing solid compositions such as tablets, the principal active ingredient is mixed with a pharmaceutical carrier, e.g. conventional tableting ingredients such as corn starch, lactose, sucrose, sorbitol, talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, dicalcium phosphate or gums, and other pharmaceutical diluents, e.g. water, to form a solid preformulation composition containing a homogeneous mixture of the principle ingredient. When referring to these preformulation compositions as homogeneous, it is meant that the active ingredient is dispersed evenly throughout the composition so that the composition may be readily subdivided into equally effective dosage forms such as tablets, pills and capsules. This solid preformulation composition is then subdivided into unit dosage forms of the type described above containing from about 1 to about 1000 mg of the active ingredient of the present invention. The tablets or pills of the novel composition can be coated or otherwise compounded to provide a dosage form affording the advantage of prolonged action. For example, the tablet or pill can comprise an<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
inner dosage and an outer dosage component, the latter being in the form of an envelope over the former. The two components can be separated by an enteric layer which serves to resist disintegration in the stomach and permits the inner component to pass intact into the duodenum or to be delayed in release. A variety of material can be used for such enteric layers or coatings, such materials including a number of polymeric acids with such materials as shellac, cetyl alcohol and cellulose acetate.<br>
The liquid forms in which the novel compositions of the present invention may be incorporated for administration orally or by injection include, aqueous solutions, suitably flavoured syrups, aqueous or oil suspensions, and flavoured emulsions with edible oils such as cottonseed oil, sesame oil, coconut oil or peanut oil, as well as elixirs and similar pharmaceutical vehicles. Suitable dispersing or suspending agents for aqueous suspensions, include synthetic and natural gums such as tragacanth, acacia, alginate, dextran, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone or gelatin.<br>
To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, a compound of formula (I), a compound of formula (II) and / or a compound of formula (III) is intimately admixed with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., i.v. sterile injectable formulations will be prepared using appropriate solubilizing agents. A unit dose would contain about 10 to about 300 mg of the active ingredient. The tablets contain some or all of the following inactive ingredients: lactose hydrous, pregelatinized starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate, magnesium stearate, purified water, carnauba wax, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol, synthetic iron oxide, and polysorbate 80. One skilled in the art will recognize that oral tablets containing a compound of formula (I), a compound of formula (II) and<br>
13<br><br>
WO 2006/007435	PCT/US2005/021513<br>
/ or a compound of formula (III) may be similarly prepared and may contain similar inactive ingredients.<br>
One skilled in the art will recognize that pharmaceutical compositions comprising more than one active ingredient may be similarly prepared according to known methods.<br>

Example 16 In Vivo Assay: Maximal Electroshock Test (MES)<br>
Anticonvulsant activity was determined using the MES test, run according to the procedure described in detail below. Swinyard EA, Woodhead JH, White HS, Franklin MR. Experimental selection, quantification, and evaluation of anticonvulsants. In Levy RH, et al., eds. Antiepileptic Drugs. 3rd ed. New York: Raven Press, 1989:85-102<br>
CF-1 male albino mice (25-35g) were fasted for 16 hours before testing. Mice were randomly selected into control and test groups, with the animals dosed with vehicle or test compound, at varying concentrations, respectively. On the study date, at 30 minutes prior to shock, the mice were orally dosed with vehicle (0.5% methylcellulose) or test compound (100-300 mg/kg). Seizures were induced by trans-comeal electric shock using a 60-Hz alternating current, 50 mA, delivered for 0.2 sec. The mice in the test groups were subjected to electrical stimulus at time intervals between 15 minutes and 4 hours following administration of test compound. The shock resulted in an immediate full body tonic extension. The test was complete when the entire course of the convulsion<br>

has been observed (typically, less than 1 minute after electrical stimulation), and the mice were then immediately euthanized by carbon dioxide inhalation.<br>
Abolition of the full body tonic extensor component of the seizure was taken as the endpoint of the test. Absence of this component indicated that the test compound had the ability to prevent the spread of seizure discharge through neural tissue. The ED50 value of the test compound (calculated when appropriate) was the calculated dose required to block the hind limb tonic-extensor component of the MES-induced seizure in 50% of the rodents tested. A probit analysis was used to calculate the ED50 and 95% fiducial limits (FL).<br>
Representative compounds of the present invention were tested according to the procedure described above, with results as listed in Table 4 below. Results are listed as number of mice with full body tonic extension prevented / total number of mice tested @ a given time (at a given test compound dosage level).<br>
