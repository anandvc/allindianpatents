				<td>Field of the Invention:<br>
The invention relates to an artificial organ for the transport of materials<br>
through the digestive tract and in one particular application to an artificial large<br>
bowel for replacing all or part of a colon or large bowel.<br>
Background of the Invention;<br>
A number of diseases or conditioas are known to compromise the ability of<br>
peristaltic digestive organs of the body to function. These diseases or conditions<br>
may require resection of all or part of the organ. Such organs may include, for<br>
example, the stomach, intestines and bowel.<br>
A number of diseases and conditions of the colon or bowel cause the colon<br>
or bowel to malfunction. In some situations such diseases or condition cause<br>
dangerous obstructions in the colon or bowel. In other situations, gastroparesis may<br>
result. Many of the diseases result in chronic or acute inflammation. As a result<br>
many diseases or conditions require removal of sections of the colon or bowel or a<br>
portion of the ilieum of the small intestine.<br>
Crohn' s disease is one example of an inflammatory bowel disease in which<br>
the inner lining of the bowel may become inflamed and cause obstructions in the<br>
bowel. Ulcerative colitus is another example of a disease of the colon characterized<br>
by ulcerations in the colon. Diverticulitis is a disease in which diverticulum of the<br>
colon become inflamed, trapping fecal material and potentially leading to<br>
obstruction, perforation or bleeding, with fecal material possibly leaking out into the<br>
abdomen. Diverticulitis in its most severe form may require resection of the<br>
affected portion of the bowel. Colon cancer, other obstructive growths may require<br>
significant portions of the bowel to be removed and in doing so may seriously<br>
compromise the functioning of the bowel. Another example of a colon/bowel<br>
diseases is toxic megacolon, where the colon becomes very large and may contain<br>
excessive amounts of feces at a given time.<br>
As noted above, many diseases are treated with.colonostomies or<br>
ileostomies, where all or a portion of the colon or ileum of the small intestine are<br>
removed. Many of these procedures require provision of an artificial stoma in the<br>
abdomen for emptying waste from the shortened functioning bowel. Often a pouch<br><br>
secured around the waist by a belt, is coupled to the stoma and is used to collect the<br>
waste. Mortality rates for the procedures remain high and for those successfully<br>
treated, the pouches are cumbersome to use and manage. Furthermore, the annual<br>
health maintenance costs for patients who have received this treatment is high.<br>
Artificial sphincters have been proposed to replace failing sphincters.<br>
Typically theses devices are cuffs to be placed around the outside of an organ to<br>
control the opening and closing of a stoma. Artificial sphincters may be used for â€¢<br>
example where fecal incontinence is present. This may occur in women as a result<br>
of childbirth.<br>
Accordingly it would be desirable to provide a device and method for<br>
replacing all or part of the bowel including in some instances, the rectal sphincter.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention provides an implantable prosthetic organ in which<br>
materials moved through the organ. In one embodiment the prosthetic organ<br>
moves material with peristaltic-like movement. The prosthetic organ includes an<br>
outer support structure, an expandable member or members located within the outer<br>
support structure, and a flexible inner member forming a conduit for the passage of<br>
material. The flexible inner member is located within the outer member and the<br>
expandable member or members are located between the inner member and the<br>
outer support structure. The expandable members are expanded and contracted, or<br>
inflated and deflated to provide a pumping action that pumps the material through<br>
the organ. The expandable members are isolated from the material moving through<br>
the prosthesis by the inner member in which the material is contained. Thus, the<br>
material avoids getting caught in the interstices around the expandable members.<br>
The prosthesis may also include valves or sphincters at the entrance and/or<br>
exit points of the organ where material moves into and out of the prosthesis. These<br>
sphincters are also isolated from the material by the inner tube.<br>
The organ is preferably an organ of the digestive sytem having an orad end<br>
through which the material enters and an aborad end out of which the material exits.<br>
The digestive organ of one particular embodiment comprises a prosthetic large<br>
intestine or bowel that replaces all or part of the large intestine or bowel.<br>
According to this embodiment, the outer member of the organ is a flexible tube.<br><br>
The prosthesis may include a valve or sphincter at the entrance (the orad end) and/or<br>
a rectal sphincter valve at the exit (the aborad end). A plurality of expandable<br>
members are arranged to be expanded in a sequence where the expandable members<br>
are expanded and contracted along the length of the prosthesis to provide a pumping<br>
action moving material through the organ. The prosthesis may work in sections that<br>
provide peristaltic movements according to a pattern or sequence of sections. For<br>
example an aborad section may be first actuated, followed by the adjacent section in<br>
the orad direction. The aborad section may then be actuated again. Thus, a build<br>
up of material and pressure from the entrance (orad end) to the end (aborad end) is<br>
avoided and the material is gradually moved through the organ.<br>
The expandable members of one embodiment are balloons or inflatable<br>
members expandable with an inflation medium. The implantable organ further<br>
comprises an implantable pump system that includes a pump and a programmable<br>
controller. The implantable pump system in one embodiment also includes a<br>
reservoir of sterile inflation medium used to inflate the various expandable<br>
members. The reservoir may be implantable separate from the pump, e.g. in soft<br>
tissue. In general, the pump system is a closed system where the inflation medium<br>
is stored or passes through as it is pumped from one inflation member to another.<br>
Each expandable member may be configured in a number of manners in which the<br>
inflation of the expandable member causes the material in the inner tube to advance.<br>
For example, the expandable member may be configured as a plurality of opposing<br>
members that are inflated together through a common valve. Alternatively, the<br>
inflatable member may be in a doughnut type shape; or the inflatable member may<br>
also be staggered from other inflatable members such that together the inflatable<br>
members are in a spiral type configuration. Other patterns may also be used for the<br>
purpose of moving material through the inner tube. Preferably, each of the<br>
expandable members or groupings of expandable members has an input port and<br>
valve coupled to the pump such that a single valve is opened at a time. However,<br>
the system may alternatively have more than one valve open at a time.<br>
The controller controls the inflation and deflation of the expandable members<br>
by controlling the opening and closing of the valves coupled to each of the<br>
expandable members, and by controlling the pump direction. In one embodiment,<br><br>
the inflatable members are inflated to a predetermined pressure. The pump may<br>
determine the inflation pressure by monitoring the pumping action or work of its<br>
motor. The inflation pressure may also be sensed by sensors that sense the pressure<br>
of the system, e.g. in the fluid header of the pump system. In one embodiment, the<br>
reservoir contains sufficient inflation medium to inflate two sections of expandable<br>
members (and if present, the rectal sphincter). According to one embodiment, a<br>
first section of expandable members corresponding to a first section of the tube is<br>
inflated, then a second adjacent section is inflated. The second section is inflated<br>
before the first section is deflated so that the material in the prosthesis cannot move<br>
back in an orad direction when the second section is inflated. The first section is<br>
then deflated. Then the fluid used to inflate the first section is then used to inflate<br>
the third section, etc. until each section is sequentially inflated.<br>
The controller may also control selection of a section of the organ for the<br>
peristaltic movement. In this regard, sections may be selected according to a<br>
desired sequence of the section actuation. The controller may be preprogrammed to<br>
control the peristalsis pattern or may be reprogrammed externally or in response to<br>
sensed conditions at various locations in the bowel. For example the sensors may<br>
sense presence or absence of material in a section of the bowel and may direct a<br>
pattern of peristaltic movement in the various sections accordingly.<br>
In one embodiment, a single electromechanical device actuates the opening<br>
and closing of the valves according to the sequence. The valve actuator selectively<br>
actuates a particular valve at a given time according to instructions from the<br>
controller.<br>
The pump and the valve actuating mechanism may be powered through a coil<br>
inductively coupled transcutaneously to an external power source, or by a battery<br>
rechargeable through such coil and external power source. According to one<br>
embodiment, a user positions and actuates the external power source to evacuate the<br>
prosthesis. The electronics unit may be powered by a rechargeable or replaceable<br>
battery as the controller consumes relatively little power in its operation.<br>
The implantable bowel may further include a rectal sphincter valve located at<br>
the aborad end of the organ. In one embodiment, the rectal sphincter valve includes<br>
expandable members configured to close the inner member into an S-shaped<br><br>
configuration. The S-shaped configuration tends to tighten and squeeze the inner<br>
member further closed when i pressure is applied at either end (orad or aborad) of<br>
the valve thus preventing leakage.<br>
The implantable bowel may also include an orad valve located at the orad<br>
end. Preferably the orad valve is a one-way valve that opens to permit substance to<br>
enter into the inner member of the prosthesis while resisting backflow of material<br>
out of the organ in an orad direction through the orad valve. In the case of the<br>
colon replacement, the orad vaive may replace the ileocecal valve. In one<br>
embodiment of the valve, a plurality of inflated members are inflated to a threshold<br>
pressure that when met permits movement of substance through the orad valve into<br>
the inner member of the prosthesis. The pressure is generally set to a typical<br>
threshold pressure that a small bowel exerts when it is contracting. In one<br>
embodiment of the orad valve, the inflated members are hinged at the orad end into<br>
the prosthesis so that when a pressure is applied from within the prosthesis tube, the<br>
hinged balloons tend to compress towards each other and further close the valve,<br>
preventing backflow of material In another embodiment, the orad valve may<br>
include a combination of a low pressure valve and a high pressure valve where the<br>
low pressure valve permits the ingress of material into the prosthesis at a given<br>
external pressure, and the high pressure valve is selectively closed when the<br>
prosthesis is actively pumping material through it to prevent backward movement of<br>
the material into the small bowel<br>
The implantable prosthetic organ may also include a pressure sensor<br>
arranged to sense a pressure corresponding to a pressure within the inner member.<br>
The pressure sensor may sense a pressure that indicates to a user the bowel should<br>
be emptied, whether from material or gas filling the prosthesis. The pressure sensor<br>
is coupled to the controller, which has a telemetry coil arranged to communicate a<br>
telemetric signal with an external device. The controller is configured to<br>
communicate an alarm signal to the external device when a pressure sensed by the<br>
pressure sensor exceeds a threshold pressure. The external control device may<br>
communicate via telemetry with the controller, receive the alarm signal, and<br>
generate a user perceivable alarm in response to the alarm signal. Upon sensing the<br>
alarm, the user may activate the external control device which communicates to the<br><br>
controller to release material and/or gas from the device. The controller may also<br>
be programmed to gently, partially open the rectal sphincter to release gas, e.g.<br>
upon receipt of a telemetrically delivered user activated control signal.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
Referring to Figure 1, according to one embodiment of the invention, a<br>
prosthetic large bowel 30' with a housing 60' inc hiding a hermetically sealed<br>
pump unit is implanted in a patient's abdomen 200'. The housing 60' may also<br>
include a controller for controlling the pump and the prosthesis. The controller may<br>
also be implanted separately (in the abdomen or subcutaneously) or located<br>
externally of the patient' s body, and coupled to the pump by an electrical<br>
connector. A bladder 49' for supplying inflation medium is implanted in the soft<br>
tissue and is coupled to the pump unit in the housing 60'. Alternatively, the<br>
bladder may be located with the pump unit. An electromagnetic coil for inductively<br>
receiving power from an external source may also be implanted subcutaneously and<br>
coupled to the pump.<br>
A schematic of a prosthetic digestive tract organ of one embodiment is<br>
illustrated in Figures 2-11. The prosthesis includes a large bowel 30, a hermetically<br>
sealed pump unit 40 and a hermetically sealed electronics unit 50 including a<br>
controller 51 for controlling the pump unit 40. The pump unit 40 and electronics<br><br>
unit 50 may be contained in the same housing such as the housing 60' illustrated in<br>
Figure 1 or may be separate.<br>
The large bowel 30 includes an outer tube 31 which comprises an inner 31i<br>
and outer layer 31o of material, a series of inflatable member pairs 36a-e, an orad<br>
valve 37 an aborad valve or rectal sphincter 38, and an inner tube 32 comprising an<br>
inner layer 32i and outer layer 32o of material. If the rectal sphincter is functional<br>
or if a partial bowel replacement is desired, the rectal sphincter may not be<br>
necessary to provide in the prosthesis.<br>
The outer tube 31 comprises a flexible, relatively inelastic material such as,<br>
for example, polyethylene or polyurethane, and provides structural support for the<br>
prosthetic bowel 30. However, an elastic material may also be used. The inflatable<br>
member pairs 36a-e form a bowel emptying mechanism 35. Hinged inflated<br>
members 37a, 37b located at the orad end portion 33 of the prosthetic bowel 30<br>
form the orad valve 37. Inflatable members 36f and 36g form the rectal sphincter<br>
38 at the aborad end portion 34 of the prosthetic bowel 30. The inner tube 32<br>
comprises a thin-walled, non-elastic flexible material such as polyethylene or<br>
polyurethane. The inside of the :nner tube 32 may be coated with an antibiotic<br>
surface, such as a silver coating, to reduce bacterial growth. The inner tube 32 is<br>
attached to the outer tube 31 at the orad end portion 33 and the aborad end portion '<br>
34	of the prosthetic bowel 30 (for example, by welding) to provide an isolated<br>
conduit through which material may pass. The orad end portion 33 of the outer tube<br>
31 includes a relatively thicker portion for suturing the outer tube 31 to a small<br>
bowel or an orad section of the colon that is to remain intact. The inner tube 32<br>
defines a lumen through which material may enter from the small bowel or small<br>
intestine and exit through the anus. The hinged members 37a, 37b forming the<br>
valve 37, the inflatable member pairs 36a-e forming the bowel emptying mechanism<br>
35	and the inflatable members 36f, 36g forming the rectal sphincter 38 are located<br>
between the outer tube 31 and the inner tube 32. The inner tube 32 floats relatively<br>
loosely within the outer tube 31 so as to permit movement including the inflation<br>
and deflation of the inflatable member pairs 36a-e and inflatable members 36f, 36g.<br>
The orad end portion 33 of the prosthetic bowel 30 is sewn onto the end of<br>
the small intestine, or in the case of a partial replacement of the bowel, the section<br><br>
of the bowel that is in communication with the small intestine. If the ileocecal valve<br>
is functional or in the case of a partial bowel replacement, the orad valve 37 may<br>
not be necessary for the prosthesis.<br>
The orad valve 37 at the orad end portion 33 of the prosthetic bowel 30 is a<br>
unidirectional valve through which material may enter into the inner tube 32 for<br>
collection and ultimate excretion from the prosthetic bowel 30. The unidirectional<br>
feature of the valve 37 serves to prevent gas or substances from backing into the<br>
small intestine from the prosthetic: bowel 30. In one application, the valve 37 may<br>
replace or augment the ileo-cecal valve between the small intestine and colon of a<br>
patient. The valve 37 comprises hinged members 37a, 37b coupled to the outer tube<br>
31 at pivot locations 31a, 31b respectively and extending in an aborad direction<br>
from the pivot locations 31a, 31b to form a constricted passage through which<br>
material may pass into the prosthetic bowel 30. The hinged members 37a, 37b are<br>
anchored at the pivot locations 31a, 31b so that they can pivotally rotate within the<br>
outer tube 31, from the locations 31a, 31b. The inner tube 32 extends from the orad<br>
end portion 33 (where it is coupled to the outer tube 31) over the valve 37, so that<br>
materials passing through the prosthetic bowel 30 do not contact the valve 37, thus<br>
preventing materials from becoming lodged in interstices created by the hinged<br>
members 37a, 37b of the valve 37. In addition the hinged members 37a, 37b and<br>
inner tube 32 in combination form a valve-sealing surface. The hinged members<br>
37a, 37b are inflated to a threshold pressure that is generally lower than that exerted<br>
by the small intestine when it is contracting to move materials into the bowel. Thus,<br>
when the small intestine is active and moving materials, a pressure is created that<br>
pushes the materials into the inner tube 32 through the valve 37. When pressure is<br>
created within the inner tube 32 from gases or the pumping action of the prosthetic<br>
bowel 30 (Figures 3-11), the hinged members 37a, 37b are pushed by the pressure,<br>
back in an orad direction, causing them to converge and close the valve 37. In this<br>
situation, the pressure within the prosthesis presses the inner tube 32 against the<br>
hinged members 37a, 37b, and resulting pressure on the hinged members 37a, 37b<br>
causes the valve 37 to close or tighten. In the illustrated embodiment, the hinged<br>
members 37a, 37b are inflated to a predetermined pressure.<br><br>
The bowel emptying mechanism 35 comprises a series inflatable member<br>
pairs 36a-e attached to the inside of the outer tube 31 between the outer tube 31 and<br>
the inner tube 32 along the length of the prosthetic bowel 30. Although pairs 36a-e<br>
are illustrated, the number of pairs of inflation members depend on a selected<br>
prosthesis length and size of the inflation member pairs. According to one<br>
embodiment, the inflatable member pairs are approximately 1.5 inches long in an<br>
uninflated state, with about 16 pairs for a 24-inch long bowel emptying mechanism.<br>
The length of the prosthesis may vary from patient to patient depending on the size<br>
of the patient and the amount of bowel to be replaced. The inflatable members may<br>
also be longer or shorter.<br>
Each inflatable member of a pair converges together when inflated, to move<br>
material through the prosthetic bowel 30. Each inflatable member pair 36a-e is<br>
coupled to and is in fluid communication with a corresponding one of conduits 39a-e,<br>
respectively. Conduits 39a-e are used to selectively deliver inflation medium to and<br>
from inflatable members 36a-e by an implanted pump unit 40.<br>
The rectal sphincter 38 is located at the aborad end portion 34 of the<br>
prosthesis where the prosthesis is attached to the anus 202. The rectal sphincter 38<br>
comprises inflation members 36f, 36g attached to the inside of the outer tube 31<br>
between the outer tube 31 and the inner tube 32. The inflation members 36f, 36g<br>
are attached on opposing sides of the outer tube 31 from each other so that when<br>
inflated, the inflation members 36f, 36g direct the inner tube 32 around in an S-<br>
configuration and pinch the inner tube 32 closed. The S-shaped configuration closes<br>
the inner tube 32 in a manner such that if pressure is exerted from within the<br>
prosthetic bowel 30 against the inflation member 36f, it will cause the inflation<br>
member 36f to further seal together or approximate any gap between the inflation<br>
member 36f and the inflation member 36g, and pinch the inner tube 32 closed<br>
further between the inflation members 36f, 36g. As such, when the sphincter 38 is<br>
subject to increases in pressure, the possibility of stress incontinence will be<br>
reduced. The inflation members 36f, 36g are coupled by way of conduits 39f, 39g<br>
respectively to ports 35f, 35g in the header 45. The inflation members 36f, 36g<br>
may be selectively inflated or deflated by the pump unit 40 as described in more<br>
detail below. In this embodiment, two opposing inflation members are illustrated.<br><br>
However, additional opposing inflation members may be provided. Furthermore,<br>
although the inflation medium is described as being pumped to and from a reservoir<br>
into and out of the inflation members 36f, 36g and inflation member pairs 36a-e, in<br>
an alternative configuration, the inflation members 36f, 36g of the rectal sphincter<br>
38 act as the fluid reservoir so as to preserve space.<br>
Additionally, one or more of the inflation member pairs 36a-e may be<br>
partially inflated during the resting stage and may be periodically monitored by<br>
opening the corresponding valve and sensing the pressure with the pressure<br>
transducer 48. Accordingly, if pressure builds up from materials or gas, the<br>
controller 51 may provide an alarm or feedback signal telemetrically to an external<br>
device, which causes a user perceivable alarm. The user then may proceed to<br>
actuate the device for evacuation. In one embodiment in order to release gas, the<br>
external device may be actuated to deliver a control signal via telemetry to the<br>
controller 51, which in turn opens the rectal sphincter valve 38 by partially<br>
emptying the inflation members 36f, 36g by controlling the valves 46f, 46g and the<br>
pump 41. The pump 41 gradually and partially pumps fluid from the inflation<br>
members 36f, 36g to release gas. The pump 41 then pumps fluid back into the<br>
inflation members 36f, 36g.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, a controller 51 of an electronics unit 50 controls<br>
the implantable pump unit 40 to selectively inflate and deflate inflatable member<br>
pairs 36a-e and inflatable members 361', 36g. The pump unit 40 includes a bidirectional<br>
 hydraulic pump 41 having an intake 47 coupled to a fluid reservoir 49<br>
and an output 44 in fluid communication with a header 45 having fluid ports 45a-g.<br>
The bi-directional pump 41 may be configured in a number of ways to provide<br>
pumping in two directions, for example, by controlling a series of valves that direct<br>
fluid into or out of the reservoir 49 or by providing a DC powered reversible pump.<br>
The fluid reservoir 49 contains a sterile, radiopaque inflation medium sufficient to<br>
inflate two pairs of inflation members 36a-e, two inflation members 36f, 36g or a<br>
combination thereof at a given time. The fluid reservoir 49 may be implanted at a<br>
location adjacent to or away from the pump unit 40 (e.g. in soft tissue).<br>
Each fluid port 45a-g is coupled to a respective valve 46a-g, which is<br>
coupled to a respective conduit 39a-g. Each conduit 39a-g is coupled to a<br><br>
corresponding inflation member pair 36a-e or inflation member 36f, 36g. The<br>
valves 46a-g are controlled by a valve actuating device 300 which operation is<br>
controlled by an electronics unit 50 of the controller 51. The valves 46a-g in this<br>
particular embodiment are controlled by a electromechanical device described in<br>
more detail with reference to Figures 16-18F. Alternative valve actuating<br>
mechanisms are also contemplated, for example, individually operated bistable<br>
solenoid valves may be used.<br>
A pressure transducer 48 is located between the output 44 of the pump 41<br>
and the header 45. The pressure transducer 48 senses the pressure of the fluid of a<br>
particular section of inflation members when the corresponding solenoid valve of the<br>
corresponding port is in an open position. The pressure transducer 48 is coupled to<br>
the controller 51, which controls the pump 41 in response to a sensed pressure.<br>
The electronics unit 50 includes a controller 51 and a battery 52 powering<br>
the controller 51. The controller 51 is programmed to control the action of the<br>
various elements of the prosthesis and to respond to various sensed conditions. The<br>
controller 51 is coupled to the pump unit 40 and controls when and in which<br>
direction the pump 41 is actuated. The controller 51 is also coupled to a valve-<br>
actuating device 300 that opens and clones the valves 46a-g according to a program<br>
stored in the controller 51, thereby sequentially inflating and deflating inflation<br>
member pairs 36a-e and inflation members 36f, 36g. According to one<br>
embodiment, only one valve is opened at a time. The controller 51 also includes a<br>
telemetry coil 54 for communicating information to and receiving information from<br>
an external device. The external device may be used to program operation<br>
parameters into the controller 51. The external device may also receive signals<br>
from the controller 51 or electronics unit 50 representative of various sensed<br>
conditions, e.g., pressure or system leaks. The external device may program or<br>
reprogram the controller 51 based on sensed parameters or other patient conditions.<br>
An external device may also power the pump 41 and the valve-actuating device 300<br>
through an electronics unit 70 comprising an electromagnetic coil 71 for inductively<br>
receiving power from an external source. The electromagnetic coil 71 is coupled to<br>
the electronics unit 50 which included a voltage regulating circuit. The electronics<br>
unit 50 and controller 51 control the pump 41 by powering the pump 41 and by<br><br>
controlling the valve actuating device 300. The voltage regulating circuit in the<br>
electronics unit 50 operates to convert a high frequency AC signal to a regulated<br>
voltage signal that powers the pump 41 and valve actuating mechanism 300.<br>
Alternatively, coil 59 may be used for both powering the pump and electronics unit 50<br>
and for bi-directional telemetry communication.<br>
The prosthetic large bowel 30 is illustrated in Figure 2 in an inactive position<br>
in which it is collecting waste material from the small bowel 201 to which it is<br>
attached at the orad end portion 33. In this position the rectal sphincter 38 at the<br>
aborad end portion 34 is in a closed position with inflation members 36f, 36g<br>
inflated. The inflation member pairs 36a-e of the bowel emptying mechanism 35<br>
are relaxed and deflated. The orad valve 37 is free to open to permit the ingress of<br>
waste material when there is sufficient pressure in the small bowel 201.<br>
The prosthetic bowel 30 also further includes wires 55a-f (Figure 2C)<br>
embedded in the prosthetic bowel 30 along its length and communicating with the<br>
electronic circuit 50. The wires 55a and 55d are located in the outer tube 31 each<br>
between layers 3 li and 3lo and on opposing sides along the prosthetic bowel 30.<br>
Wires 55b and 55e are exposed between the inflation member pairs 36a-e and the<br>
outer tube 31 on opposing sides along the prosthetic bowel 30. Wires 55c and 55f are<br>
located in the inner tube 32 along the bowel 30 between layer 32i and 32o. Wire pairs<br>
55a and 55d form an open circuit as do wire pairs 55b and 55e, and wire pairs 55c and<br>
55f. The electronic circuit 50 is configured to sense a large drop in impedance in one<br>
or more of the pairs wires 55a-f, where a fluid closes the circuit of one or more of the<br>
wire pairs indicating potential leakage of fluid into, out of or within the bowel 30, e.g<br>
from material external the prosthetic bowel 30, material passing through the inner<br>
member 32 of the bowel 30 or from an inflation member, or otherwise. In particular,<br>
a low impedance may be detected by the controller 51, which is configured to sense<br>
impedance changes in the wires 55a-f. The impedance of the pairs of wires 55a-f is<br>
periodically monitored by the controller 51. If a leak is detected a patient alarm<br>
may be triggered, e.g., by telemetrically delivering an alarm signal from the<br>
electronics unit 50 to an external device. Furthermore, the location or cause of the<br>
leak may be determined by which sires 55a-f have changed impedances. The wire<br>
pairs may be placed in different configurations within layers 31i, 31o, 32i, 32o or<br><br>
between the inner 32 and outer members 31, for example, they may be is parallel<br>
spiraled configurations to maximize the sensing of potential leaks.<br>
The prosthetic bowel 30 also includes a conduit 56 through the prosthetic<br>
bowel 30, into a port 57 inside the inner tube 31 for receiving an antibiotic material<br>
from a reservoir 58. The reservoir 58 is coupled to the controller 51 and may<br>
include a pump controlled by the controller 51 that provides a periodic or otherwise<br>
actuated (e.g. by a patient) injection of antibiotic material or gas dissolving material<br>
into the inner tube 32.<br>
Figures 3-11 illustrate a sequence of emptying the bowel 30 of one<br>
embodiment of the invention. In Figure 3, the inflation member 36f of the rectal<br>
sphincter 38 is emptied through the conduit 39f by opening valve 46f. The pump 41<br>
pumps the inflation medium out of the inflation member 36f and into the reservoir<br>
49, which is then partially full. The valve 46f is then closed.<br>
Next as shown in Figure 4, the valve 46a is opened and the pump 41 pumps<br>
inflation medium from the reservoir 49 into the inflation member pair 36a through<br>
the conduit 39a. The inflation member pair 36a is inflated to a predetermined<br>
pressure as sensed by pressure transducer 48 or alternatively as sensed by the<br>
motor. Once the inflation member pair 36a is inflated, the valve 46a is closed by<br>
the valve actuating mechanism 60 (Fig. 2). Inflation of the inflation member pair<br>
36a closes the valve 37 on the orad end portion 33 due to the pressure from the<br>
inflation of pair 36a. Waste material is moved in an aborad direction within the<br>
inner tube 32, due to the mechanical movement of the inflation member pair 36a and<br>
any pressure gradient resulting therefrom.<br>
Next, as shown in Figure 5, the rectal sphincter 38 is completely opened by<br>
opening the valve 46g and pumping the fluid from the inflation member 36g through<br>
conduit 39g and into the reservoir 49. Thus material is permitted to exit through the<br>
rectal sphincter 38.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 6, inflation member pair 36b is next inflated to<br>
advance material through the prosthetic bowel 30. Before the adjacent inflation<br>
member pair 36a is deflated, the inflation member pair 36b is inflated by opening<br>
the valve 46b and inflating by pumping fluid from the reservoir 49 that was pumped<br>
out of the inflation member 36g, into inflation member pair 36b through conduit<br><br>
39b. Thus, any materials are moved further in the aborad direction without<br>
allowing the material to move back in the direction of the inflation member pair<br>
36a. The valve 46b is then closed.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the valve 46a is selected again. The pump direction is<br>
reversed and the inflation medium is pumped out of the inflation member pair 36a<br>
and is returned to the reservoir 49. The orad end portion 33 of the prosthetic bowel<br>
30is isolated from the material moving through the inner tube 32 by the inflation<br>
member pair 36b. The valve 46a is then closed.<br>
Referring to Figure 8, inflation member pair 36c is next inflated to advance<br>
material further through the prosthetic bowel 30. Before the adjacent inflation<br>
member pair 36b is deflated, the inflation member pair 36c is inflated by opening<br>
the valve 46c and inflating by pumping fluid from the reservoir 49 into inflation<br>
member pair 36c through conduit 39c. Thus, any materials are moved further in the<br>
aborad direction without permitting the material to move back in the direction of the<br>
inflation member pair 36b. The valve; 46c is then closed.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, the valve 46b is selected again, the pump direction is<br>
reversed and the inflation medium is pumped out of the inflation member pair 36b<br>
and is returned to the reservoir 49. The orad end portion 33 of the prosthetic bowel<br>
30is isolated from the material moving through the inner tube 32 by the inflation<br>
member pair 36c. The valve 46b is then closed. A number of inflation member<br>
pairs may be provided in the prosthetic bowel 30 and the sequence of inflating and<br>
deflating the inflation members continues until the last inflation member pair 36e is<br>
inflated.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 10 and 11, after inflation member pair 36e is<br>
inflated and subsequently inflation member pair 36d is deflated, the remaining<br>
material is advanced through the rectal sphincter 38 and the sphincter 38 is closed<br>
by first inflating the inflation member 36f by opening valve 46f and pumping<br>
inflation medium from reservoir 49 through conduit 39f. The inflation member pair<br>
36e is deflated by opening valve 46e and pumping the inflation medium into the<br>
reservoir 49. (Figure 10) The valve 46e is closed and valve 46g is opened and the<br>
inflation medium from the reservoir 49 is pumped into the inflation member 36g to<br>
close the valve 38.<br><br>
This cycle of inflating and deflating inflation members may be repeated in<br>
subsequent bowel emptying steps or sequences. The cycle may also be modified<br>
and the order of emptying along the length of the prosthetic bowel may be done is<br>
subsections according to a program, such as for example, as illustrated in Figure 13.<br>
Referring to Figure 13, a sequence of emptying of one embodiment is illustrated.<br>
According to the embodiment, a prosthetic bowel 330 is illustrated as being divided<br>
into five sections, Sections A-E with section A being the aborad most section<br>
coupled to the anus and section E being coupled to the small intestine. Each section<br>
includes a series of inflatable members such as, for example, the inflatable members<br>
of the prosthesis described with respect to Figures 2-11. As illustrated in Figure 13,<br>
the sections of inflatable members are actuated in a sequence of sections. In the first<br>
sequence I, section A is actuated so that the inflatable members are inflated in a<br>
sequence in an aborad direction, excreting the material in section A.<br>
After A is actuated, a second sequence II of inflatable member sections is<br>
actuated in which section B is actuated so that the inflatable members of section B<br>
are inflated in a sequence in an aborad direction and then section A is actuated<br>
inflating inflatable members of suction A in an aborad direction. Thus, material is<br>
moved through sections B, then A and then is excreted.<br>
A third sequence III of inflatable member sections is actuated in which section<br>
C is actuated, then section B is actuated and then section A is actuated. Thus material<br>
is moved through sections C, B, and A, and then is excreted. And similarly the fourth<br>
sequence IV of inflatable member sections is actuated with section D followed by<br>
Section C followed by section B and then followed by Section A. Finally a fifth<br>
sequence V of inflatable member sections is actuated with section E, followed by<br>
Section D, followed by section C, followed by Section B and followed by Section A.<br>
Thus, the prosthetic bowel 330 is emptied by first emptying the aborad most section<br>
and slowly working towards the orad end so that the pump does not have to pump the<br>
entire prosthetic bowel out at one time.<br>
Figures 12A and 12B illustrate an alternative embodiment of a prosthetic<br>
bowel of the invention with a two stage orad valve. The prosthetic bowel 130<br>
includes an outer tube 131, a plurality of inflatable member pairs 136, an inner tube<br>
132 and an orad valve 137. The outer tube 131 comprises a first portion 131a<br><br>
constructed of a flexible, elastic material coupled to a second portion 131b<br>
constructed of a flexible, inelastic material. The inner tube 132 comprises a thin-<br>
walled, in-elastic flexible material such as polyethylene or polyurethane.<br>
Alternatively an elastic material may be used. The inside of the inner tube 132 may be<br>
coated with an antibiotic surface, such as a silver coating, to reduce bacterial growth.<br>
The inner tube 132 is attached TO the outer tube 131 at the orad end portion 133 and<br>
the aborad end portion (not shown) of the prosthetic bowel 130 (for example, by<br>
welding) to provide an isolated conduit through which material may pass. The orad<br>
end portion 133 of the outer tube 131 includes a relatively thicker portion 138 for<br>
suturing the outer tube 131 to a small bowel or an orad section of the colon that is to<br>
remain intact. The inner tube 132 defines a lumen through which material may enter<br>
from the small bowel or small intestine and exit through the anus. The inflatable<br>
member pairs 136, located between the inner member 131 and the second portion<br>
131b of the outer member form a bowel emptying mechanism 13S. The number of<br>
inflatable member pairs 136 may be selected based on the desired length of the<br>
prosthetic bowel 130.<br>
The orad valve 137, located at the orad end portion 133 of the prosthetic<br>
bowel 130 between the outer tube 131 and inner tube 132, comprises a first low<br>
pressure valve 141 and a second high pressure valve 142. The low pressure valve<br>
141 includes two opposing inflated members 141a, 141b inflated to a predetermined<br>
pressure. The inflated member;! 141a, 141b are attached to the outer tube 131 and<br>
located between the inner tube 3 32 and the first portion 131a of the outer tube. The<br>
inflated members 141a, 141b tend to close together. (Figure 12A) When a sufficient<br>
pressure or force is created in the small intestine from material moving from the<br>
small intestine into the prosthesis, the inflated members 141a, 141b open to permit<br>
the passage of material, pressing against the flexible elastic first portion of the outer<br>
tube 131 which expand under a chureshold pressure. (Figure 12B).<br>
The high-pressure valve 142 is adjacent the low-pressure valve 141 in an<br>
aborad direction. The high-pressure valve 142 includes opposing inflatable<br>
members 142a and 142b located within the second portion of the valve 137. When<br>
inflated to a predetermined pressure, the inflatable members squeezes the inner tube<br>
132 together preventing movement of material between the small intestine and the<br><br>
prosthetic bowel 130. To close the high-pressure valve 142, it is inflated by way of<br>
pumping fluid through conduit 144 with a fluid pump such as the pump 41 described<br>
with reference to Figures 2-11. Typically the high-pressure valve 142 is left open<br>
when the prosthetic bowel 130 is collecting materials from the small intestine<br>
(Figure 12 B). The high-pressure valve 142 is typically closed during or just prior<br>
to the bowel emptying mechanism 135 being actuated (Figure 12A). The inflatable<br>
members 142a, 142b' are inflated to a high pressure that can with stand the pressure<br>
of the bowel emptying mechanism 135 when it is actuated to move material through<br>
the prosthetic bowel 130. Alternatively or in addition, inflation members such as<br>
inflation member pairs 136 may be used as a high-pressure valve in the two-stage<br>
valve.<br>
Alternatively, as illustrated in Figures 12C and 12D the inflated members<br>
141a' , 141b' are coupled through a conduit 143' extending from the inflated<br>
members 141a', 141b' out of the outer tuber 131' , to an elastic bladder 146'<br>
The outer tube 131' of the prosthetic bowel 130' is relatively inelastic. When a<br>
force exceeding a predetermined pressure is applied to the inflated members 141a'<br>
141b', for example, by a pressure or by material entering the prosthetic bowel<br>
from the small bowel, a portion of the inflation medium within the inflated members<br>
141a' , 141b' is squeezed into the elastic bladder 146' (Figure 12D). When the<br>
force is removed, the elasticity of the bladder 146' ca uses the bladder 146' to<br>
contract and squeeze the fluid out of the bladder back into the inflated members<br>
141a' , 141b' to its original resting state (Figure 12C). Generally, the pressure of<br>
the low-pressure valve 141' is lower than or matches the pressure exerted by the<br>
small bowel when it contracts. Thus the low pressure valve remains closed unless a<br>
pressure is exerted on the orad Hide of the valve 141' The valve 141' tends to<br>
close when a pressure is exerted from the aborad side in a similar manner as<br>
described with reference to Figures 2-11 above with respect to the valve 37. A<br>
high-pressure valve 142' operates in the same way as high pressure valve 142<br>
described with reference to Figures 12A and 12B.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates an alternative configuration of inflatable members 156a-<br>
e and 157a-e of a bowel emptying mechanism 155 of an alternative embodiment of a<br>
prosthetic bowel 150. Upper inflatable members 156a-e are offset from the lower<br><br>
inflatable members 157a-e so that material is not stuck between opposing inflation<br>
member pairs. The inflatable members 156a-e, 157a-e may be inflated in a<br>
sequence similar to the sequence described above with respect to Figures 2-11 or<br>
alternatively each inflation member may be inflated in an aborad moving sequence.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates another configuration of inflatable members 166a-d of a<br>
bowel emptying mechanism 165 of an alternative embodiment of a prosthetic bowel<br>
160. Each inflatable member 166a-d comprises an inflatable member wrapped in a<br>
spiral-like configuration around the inner circumference of the outer tube 162. The<br>
inflatable members 166a-d may be inflated in a sequence similar to the sequence<br>
described above with respect to Figures 2-11 and each inflation member may be<br>
inflated in an aborad moving sequence.<br>
Figure 19 illustrates an alternative embodiment of a prosthesis 170 of the<br>
invention. The prosthetic bowel 170 comprises an outer tube 171, and inner tube<br>
172 and an inflation member pair 176 located between the inner tube 172 and the<br>
outer tube 171. Waste material enters the orad end portion 173, which is coupled to<br>
the small intestine (not shown), and exits the aborad end portion 174 which is<br>
coupled to the anus (not shown). A pump 178 is controlled by a controller 180 to<br>
pump fluid from a bladder 179 through a fluid conduit 177 and into the inflation<br>
member pair 176, and, visa versa to pump material out of the prosthetic bowel 170.<br>
The prosthetic bowel 170 may be used to replace the bowel or a small portion of<br>
the small or large bowel.<br>
Figure 20 illustrates an alternative configuration of an inflation member 196<br>
to be used in a prosthetic bowel 190 wherein the inflation member 196 has a U-<br>
shape or a donut-like shape. The inflation member 196 is located between an outer<br>
tube 191 and an inner tuba 192 and is inflated and deflated with an inflation medium<br>
through a conduit 199.<br>
Figures 16-18F illustrate a valve-actuating device 300 according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention. The valve-actuating device 300 comprises a cylinder<br>
310 having a length Lc aligned parallel with the length Lh of the header 45 of the<br>
pump 41 andadjacent the valves 46a-g. The cylinder 310 includes a plurality of<br>
openings 320a-g, spaced a defined distance along the length Lc of the cylinder 310<br>
with respect to the other openings so that each opening is aligned lengthwise with a<br><br>
corresponding one of the valves 46a-g. Each opening 320a-g is also spaced a<br>
defined discrete distance circuinferentially from the other openings. The cylinder<br>
310 is coupled to a stepper motor 330 that rotates the cylinder 310 according to<br>
instructions from the controller 51 (Figure 2) into discrete circumferential positions<br>
to interfacingly align a selected opening with a corresponding selected valve. Thus,<br>
the cylinder 310 may be rotated to discrete positions wherein in each position one of<br>
the openings 320a-g is interfacing a corresponding one of the valves 46a-g to be<br>
actuated.<br>
A valve is actuated by a peg extending out of an interfacing opening in the<br>
cylinder 310 to engage and move the valve into an open position. Each opening<br>
320a-g in the cylinder 310 includes concentrically moveable peg 321a-g<br>
respectively. Each of the pegs 321a-g is capable of being partially advanced in a<br>
circumferential direction out of the corresponding opening 320a-g in the cylinder<br>
310. When interfacing with a corresponding valve 46a-g, a corresponding peg<br>
321a-g may be advanced to engage and open the corresponding valve 46a-g to open<br>
it.<br>
Once a valve is selected and the controller 51 instructs the stepper motor 330<br>
to rotatablyposition the cylinder 310 accordingly, an actuating rod 323 is advanced<br>
through the cylinder 310 to engage and advance the corresponding aligned,<br>
interfacing peg out of the cylinder 310 to open the corresponding valve.<br>
The actuating rod 323 slidably extends axially through an axial opening 313<br>
in the cylinder 310. The rod 323 is coupled to a solenoid 328 that moves the rod<br>
323 between two positions: a first resting position (Figure 16-16A, Figures 18-18F)<br>
and a second valve actuating position (Figure 17-17A). The solenoid 328 advances<br>
and retracts the rod 323 to and from a valve actuating position. The actuating rod<br>
323 moves in a direction generally perpendicular to the circumferential sliding<br>
direction of the pegs 321a-g. The actuating rod 323 includes a central rod 324 and a<br>
plurality of staggered fins :325a-g having cammed surfaces 326 a-g. In the first<br>
position, the fins 325a-g are staggered in a lengthwise relationship between the<br>
valves 46a-g and a second position, the fins 325a-g are generally aligned in a<br>
lengthwise relationship with the valves 46a-g. The cammed surfaces 326a-g are<br>
arranged so that when the rod 323 is advanced to the second position, a<br><br>
corresponding one of the cammed surfaces 326a-g will engage a corresponding one<br>
of the pegs 321a-g to move the corresponding one of the pegs 321a-g<br>
circumferentially out of a corresponding one of the openings 320a-g.<br>
The axial opening 313 through the cylinder 310 includes a central rod<br>
portion 314 for receiving the rod 323 and a fin portion 315 for receiving in the fins<br>
325a-g. The central rod portion 314 extends axially through the cylinder 310. The<br>
fin portion 315 of the axial opening 313 includes open portions 316a-g staggered in<br>
a lengthwise relationship between the valves 46a-g. Each open portion 316a-g is<br>
open within the rod opening 313 about the circumference of the cylinder 310 so that<br>
when the rod 323 is in the first position, the cylinder 310 is free to rotate without<br>
interference of the fins 325a-g. The fin portion 315 also includes a plurality of slits<br>
317a-g wherein each slit extends longitudinally through the cylinder, between each<br>
of the open portions 316a-g and perpendicularly through a corresponding one of the<br>
openings 320a-g.<br>
The fins 325a-g are aligned in a position with the circuferentially extending<br>
top portions facing the header 4.1. The cylinder 310 may be rotated when the rod<br>
323 and fins 325a-g are in the first position. The cylinder 310 when rotated to one<br>
of its discrete positions aligns a corresponding slit with the fins so that in the second<br>
position the fins advance through that slit. When the fins 325a-g are moved into the<br>
second position, the fins 325a-g extend through the slit corresponding to the opening<br>
that is positioned in alignment with a corresponding valve. In each discrete position<br>
the fins 325a-g are aligned with a slit permitting the corresponding fin to slide into<br>
the opening and engage the pin moving the pin out of the opening engaging the<br>
correspond valve with which it is aligned, thus actuating the corresponding valve.<br>
Each peg 321a-g is biased by a corresponding spring (329a only is shown) into a<br>
position circumferentially into foe opening so that when the fins are retracted (e.g.<br>
Figure 18), the pin moves back into the opening.<br>
The controller 51 controls the timing and actuation of the cylinder 310<br>
rotation and the solenoid 328 positioning. Referring to Figure 16, the cylinder 310<br>
is rotated to a position in which none of the pegs are aligned with valve 36a. The<br>
rod 323is in a first position in which the cylinder 310 may rotate freely. The<br>
cylinder 310 is then rotated as illustrated in Figure 17 so that the opening 321a is<br><br>
aligned with the valve 46a. The rod 323 is advanced so that the fins 325a-g extend<br>
through the slit 317a. Fin 325a extends into the opening 320a that is aligned with<br>
the slit 325a and the cammed surface 326a of the fin 325a engages the peg 321a and<br>
advances it out of the opening 320a to actuate valve 46a. The valve 46a is opened<br>
and the pump 41 pumps fluid from the reservoir 49 into the inflatable member pair<br>
36a. As illustrated in Figure 18, the rod 323 is then retracted releasing the peg<br>
321a, which is biased by spring 329a into the cylinder opening 320a, and the valve<br>
46a is closed, leaving the inflation member pair 36a inflated.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to particular<br>
