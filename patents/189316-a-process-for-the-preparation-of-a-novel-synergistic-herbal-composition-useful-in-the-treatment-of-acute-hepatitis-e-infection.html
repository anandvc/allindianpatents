				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The present invention relates to a method for the<br>
preparation of a novel synergistic pharmaceutical herbal<br>
composition, useful in the treatment acute viral Hepatitis<br>
and therapeutic effects on (1) acute hepatitis due to<br>
Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), (2) healthy Hepatitis B Virus<br>
carrier state with a super infection (intercurrent) by<br>
Hepatitis E Virus resulting in acute hepatitis. The<br>
present novel herbal composition is derived essentially<br>
from four plants namely (1) Phyllanthus amarus, (2) Eclipta<br>
alba, (3) Andrographis paniculata, (4) Picrorhiza kurroa.<br>
In addition, the present invention also provides a, novel<br>
herbal composition comprising essentially extracts from<br>
plants namely (1) Phyllanthus    amarus,	(2) Eclipta    alba,<br>
(3) andrographis paniculata,       (4) Picrorhiza   kurroa   and (5) Rheum  emodi.   -<br>
The present novel composition is the safe and effective herbal pharmaceutical preparation for the treatment of acute viral hepatitis caused by Hepatitis E virus infection, healthy Hepatitis B virus carrier who develop a superadded acute viral hepatitis due to Hepatitis E virus. Further, the said composition also acts as a hepatoprotective agent and improves the liver cell line functions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION :<br>
The	Ayurvedic      system     of<br>
Indian    medicine    provides     many    formulations for treating    many    disorders/diseases in human being.    A<br>
few of the plants have already been investigated for the beneficial medicinal properties.<br>
Phyllanthus amarus : Phyllanthus amarus is a herbaceous plant which occurs as a winter weed throughout the hotter parts of India. The plant is bitter and astringent in taste and the extract of the roots and the leaves are used as a remedy for jaundice and other liver disorders.<br>
Eclipta alba : Eclipta alba is a herbaceous plant which grows in moist conditions throughout India. The extracts of Eclipta alba are largely used for the treatment of the liver and the ga11 bladder. The plant juice and extracts are used in combination with other aromatics in the treatment of jaundice. Andrographis paniculata : Andrographis paniculata is an annual herb which is grown as a hedge plant throughout the plains of India. The plant is reputed in the Ayurvedic system of medicine to be useful in the treatment of sluggish liver and jaundice. Picrorrhiza kurroa : P. kurroa is a perennial herb found in the Alpine Himalayas from Kashmir to Sikkim. Its use in the Ayurvedic system of medicine is described as being used in the disease states of jaundice, liver disorders and urinary disor-ders.<br>
Fuaaria officinalis : This plant, reputed to be useful in disor-ders of the liver, is found throughout India, from the Indo-gangetic plain to the Nilgiri Hills,<br>
Tinospora cordifolia : This species is a succulent climbing shrub and it occurs in most districts of Southern India. The extracts of T cordifolia are effective in promoting the regenera-tion of liver tissue, and preventing fibrous changes in the incidence of hepatotoxicity. The crude drug itself, and the tincture prepared from it are now official in the Indian pharma-copea.<br>
Terrainalia chebula : The fruits of this large deciduous tree are used for its purgative, tonic and carminative properties- In combination with Embellica myrobalans and Belleric mYroballan, under the Indian name TRIPHALA, these fruits are used as adjuncts to other medicines in the treatment of almost all disease state in the Ayurvedic system of medicine.<br>
Cichorum intybus : This is a rough and glandular perennial herb found throughout northwest India. The root of the plant is known to be useful in the disease states of the enlargement of the liver and the spleen.<br>
Tephrosia purpurea : The root of this branched herbaceous plaint has been found to be useful in the treatment of sluggish liver by improving its function and in enlarged spleen.<br>
Rheum emodi : Rheum emodi is a plant grown in sub Himalayan regions of India and its neighbouring countries. The traditional preparation consists of dried rhizome of the plant and roots which are cut into pieces and dried.<br>
Rhubarb root contains a large proportion of Chrysophanic acid, sometimes called Chrysophan, an allied substance Emodin, a glucoside rhapantiein, a tannin named Rheo tannic acid several resins, an albuminoid principle, mucilage, extractives, tannic and gallic acids, sugar, starch, pectin, lignan, calcium oxalate and various inorganic salts.<br>
Acute hepatitis is usually viral in origin and it is a diffuse necro-inflammatory disease of the liver as a result of infection by primary seven hepatotropic viruses A {HAV), B .(HBV) parentral transmitted non-A non-B (HCV), Delta (HDV) and enteti-cally transmitted non-A non-B (HEV), F (HFV) and G (HGV). HEPATITIS E VIRUS (HEV) :<br>
The absence of serological markers for either Hepatitis I A Virus (HAV) or Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) led to the recognition of a viral hepatitis agent (s) which were collectively grouped as non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) virus. Two epidemiologically distinct forms of NANBH were identified which appeared to be transmitted by either (a) parenteral route or (b) fecal/oral route. The virus responsible for most cases of parenterally transmitted NANBH has been termed hepatitis C virus (HCV).<br>
A second, epidemiologically distinct form of NANBH was referred to as enterically transmitted NANBH (ET-NANBH). Major outbreaks of ET-NANBH have occurred in Asia, the Soviet Union, North America and Africa. The etiological agent of ET-NANBH has been  identified cloned and termed the hepatitis E virus  (HEV).<br>
The serological tests to diagnose acute HEV hepatitis as demon-strated by the presence of HEV-IgM/IgG have recently been commer-cially available and been useful in identifying the aetiological agent in patients of acute infection, healthy HBV carriers who develop a superadded (intercurrent) infection with HEV. Due to the commercial availability of the diagnostic tests for HEV infection (HEV IgM/IgG) a clear epidemiological data, natural history of the disease and drugs/natural plant products which might be useful in treating patients of acute HEV infection will emerge in future.<br>
The first direct evidence for a new viral agent of ET-NANBH came in 1983 from human volunteers and cynomolgns monkeys transmission studies. The feces inoculum was found by Immune Electfon Microscopy (lEM) to contain 27-30 nm virus like particles which reacted to serum from the human and cynomolgus monkeys during acute phase of the disease. Feces obtained during the course of the experimental infection were also found to contain 27-30 nm particles which reacted to acute phase sera from the monkeys, the human volunteer and the inoculum source individuals. The absence of a cell culture system lead to use of cyno or human specimens for molecular cloning of the HEV agent.<br>
The first well characterized epidemic for HEV was in Delhi, India in 1955 in which 29300 individuals were involved.<br>
Since then over 30 epidemics of ET-NANBH have been identi-fied in the last 10 years m 17 different countries all over the world.<br>
Sporadic cases of HEV have been known to occur in the same geographic areas of epidemics. Sporadic cases have also been reported among persons from Europe and the U.S. traveling to areas endemic for HEV. Sporadic HEV accounts upto 50% of clini-cal hepatitis in areas endemic for the HEV disease. If all of these cases are due to HEV then this viral agent is the most common cause of acute viral hepatitis occurring in the developing world.<br>
Large outbreaks of HEV infection generally occur in tropifral climates and are usually associated with fecal contamination of drinking water caused by flooding during the rainy reason.The disease seems to have its highest attack in young adults.<br>
Epidemics appear to be cyclical, occurring every few years in areas endemic for the virus probably due to a short-lived immunity acquired after exposure HEV.<br>
The incubation period of HEV has a mean of about 6 weeks. The disease appears to be self limiting without the development. of chronicity and long term sequelae. However, there is a much higher degree of mortality associated with HEV than with HAV. In epidemics it has been known to be as high as 1.2%. The preicter-ic  stage lasts for 1-10 days and this includes  gastrointestinal<br>
symptoms such as pain, nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite. The icteric phase includes jaundice, dark urine and clay-coloured stools along with tender hepatomegaly. There is a gross altara-tion in liver function tests e.g. Serum Bilirubin, SGPT, SCOT and Alkaline Phosphatase along with the presence of anti HEV IgM which establishes the aetiological diagnosis of the disease This period usually lasts for about three to four weeks and complete recovery characterised by clinical improvement in sings and symptoms along with normalization of liver function tests usually occurs in approximately three months after onset of symptoms. Histopathological examination of needle biopsy specl-men obtained during the course of Hepatitis E have no features that distinguish this form from other forms of acute viral hepa-titis. There is a high rate of fulminant hepatitis associated with HEV, particularly among pregnant woman in the third trimes-ter with a fatality rate of between 10-40%. Immunity to HEV. i-s transient. There is a strong IgM response during the acute phase followed by a rise in IgG anti-HEV antibody, which begins to disappear after about 9 months post infection. HEV infection does not appear to lead to chronic liver disease but it aan aggravate the course of chronic hepatitis B virus infection or produce a superinfection (intercurrent) in a healthy hepatitis B virus carrier state thereby resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.   The control measure for acute HEV hepatitis  incli<br>
provision of clean water supplies, safe disposal of human excreta<br>
and  sound  personal  and food hygiene  practices.   No  specific<br>
treatment for infection caused by Hepatitis E virus is  curreritly<br>
available.<br>
HEPATITIS B VIRUS (HBV) :<br>
Hepatitis B virus is partially double stranded DNA virus that replicates in part through an RNA intermediate. The com-plete virus is known as Dane particle and measures 42 nm  in diameter. This consists of a 27 nm core of an incomplete dsDNA surrounded by a coat of surface material. Man is the natural source and reservoir of Hepatitis B virus infection. So far, no effective drug therapy against HBV has been available. Hepatit is B virus is endemic in some population and hyperendemic in many parts of world. Chronic infection occurs in less than 2% of population in North America, Western Europe, Australia, where as high prevalence rate is seen in Asia, the pacific islands, part of China and India. The only way of gradually eradicating the infection is by (1) active universal immunisation in childhood and/or (2) development of treatment modalities for persistently infected persons. The source of infection is HBV infected bloHod or transmission by sexxial route from infected mother to newborn (perinatal). All age groups and both sexes are susceptibly. Endemicity exists and high risk groups include blood recipients, haemophilics, dialysis patients, intravenous drug users, heterp-sexuals,  health care workers and children born to  HBV  infect<br>
mothers. The incubation period of acute HBV hepatitis is 4-18 weeks. The first marker appearing in blood is HbsAg followed by a high rise in transaminase levels. HBV infection may lead to both asymptomatic and sever form of liver diseases. Around 5-10% of acute HBV infected population be.come chronic carriers. HBV carrier stage is common if exposure occurs in early childhood. Most of the infections are acquired in early childhood, usually as mother to child transmission and results in a persistent HBV carrier stage. There are more than 200 Hepatitis B virus carriers in world, who besides .developing a chronic liver disease (chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinomal as a result of persistent HBV infection are also at a constant risk of acquiring a super infection with other hepatotropic viruses which might worsen their clinical condition. Infection with Hepatitis Delta Virus, hepatitis noh-A, non-B ' [both Hepatitis C virus (HCV) , Hepatitis E virus (HEV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV)] is hazardous to healthy carriers of hepatitis B virus. In developed countries e.g. Italy, France, England and United States, Hepatitis Delta or Hepatitis C virus have been found to be major aetiological factor's which usually lead to super infection in HBV carriers. In contrast, the high prevalence of HEV in the Indian continent and being the major aetiological agent responsible for acute hepatitis is postulated to present a big risk of intercur-<br>
rrent infection in HBV carrier and may lead to severe liver injury. At present there is no effective therapy is available for such a group of healthy hepatitis B virus carriers who are super infected with Hepatitis E virus and develop acute hepatitis.<br>

EXAMPLE 2  :  describes the controlled  clinical  trial  of the present composition (with Rheum emodi) in the treatment of  acute viral hepatitis caused by Hepatitis E virus infection. MATERIAL &amp; METHOD :<br>
Nine (9) patients (6 males, 3 females) of a mean age of 11.5 years (range 18 to 45 years) presenting within one week of the onset of the clinical symptoms suggestive of classical acute viral hepatitis (AVH) were included in the study. The diagnosis of AVH was established by the clinical symptoms (acute onset orf jaundice, gastrointestinal symptoms p.g. abdominal pain, anorexia, vomiting along with tender hepatomegaly). The diagnosis was supplemented by abnormal liver function tests e.g. estimation [of Serum  Bilirubin, ALT (SGPT), AST (SCOT), and  Alkaline  Phospa-<br>
J-<br>
tase. The diagnosis of the etiological agents (hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D and E) were done by the following parameters : hepatitis B virus - presence of HBcIgM with or without HBsAg, hepatitis A virus - presence of HAV IgM, hepatitis C virus - presence Â©f anti HBc, hepatitis D virus - presence of anti HDV IgM, hepatitis E virus - presence of anti HEV IgM. All the serological tests were done by Enzyme Immune Assay (Elisa) at the time of clinical presentation and the subsequent intervals during therapy.  In all<br>
the 9 patients the serological markers of hepatitis A, B, C and D were absent and only anti HEV IgM was present. Further, the other possible causes which might have led to a similar clinical presentation e.g. surgical jaundice, drug mdaced cholestasis, herpes and cytomegalo virus infection were also excluded in all the 9 patients. A prior consent of all the patients were ob-tained and they were explained about the treatment protocol. The preparation of polyhedral pharmaceutical preparation in the tablet form for clinical use in the above 9 patients has been described in example 1. Each patient was given 2 tablets of polyhedral pharmaceutical preparation, two times a day for a period of 4 weeks. The clinical assessment and the liver fund-tion tests along with the anti HEV IgM (Elisa) was done at two weekly interval, also if required at weekly interval (m pateent No.9). RESULTS :<br>
Table 1 - shows the mean values of liver function tests eft the time of diagnosis and at subsequent period of polyher^j^ pharmaceutical composition therapy.<br>
Table 2 - summarises the effects of the polyherbal pharita-ceutical composition therapy.<br>
Tables 3 to 8 - show the details of liver function tests ^at the time of presentation (prior to start of therapy) and at 2 a^iB 4 week interval of the polyherbal pharmaceutical composit:^Â» therapy.<br>
In all the nine Acute E virus hepatitis patients a clinical as well as biochemical recovery was noted from second week onward. A complete clinical recovery occurred in all the patients by four weeks of therapy. No side effect of the therapy was observed in any of the nine patients.<br>

The present polyherbal pharmaceutical composition thus promotes a rapid rate of recovery in subjective symptoms and objective parameters supported by liver function tests in patients 'of acute Hepatitis E virus infection thereby grossly reducing the period of clinical convalescence.<br>
Example 3 : The usefulness of the present polyherbal pharmacqsu-tical composition in the therapy of hepatitis B virus carrier developing a super imposed acute hepatitis due to hepatitis E virus infection has been illustrated.<br>
A 45 year health male who has been a carrier of hepatitis B virus (as demonstrated by the presence of HBsAg at two different intervals of 3 months each) developed acute hepatitis E virus infection resulting in hepatitis. The Table 11 shows the details of the liver function tests at the time of presentation (before the start of therapy) and subsequently upto 16 weeks at the interval of 4 weeks. He received the polyherbal pharmaceutical composition in the doses of two tablets two times a day for a period of 12 weeks. There was a marked improvement in the liver function tests at 4 weeks interval with a complete recovery occurring at the end of 8 weeks therapy. Clearance of hepatitis B virus infection was observed at the end of 8 weeks therapy. The  therapy with the polyherbal pharmaceutical  composition was<br>
stopped after 12 weeks and the liver function tests were idane after 4 weeks, which were normal along with the absence nf hepa-titis B virus infection.<br>
HBV Carrier with Acute HEV Superinfection snows the findings of liver  function tests, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis  E vi|i|s. In a patient receiving polyherbal pharmaceutical composition-<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Normal values: SCOT = 10-35 lU/L : SGPT = 10--in IU/L: S.Bilirubin = 0.3-1.0 mg/dl: AlK. Phosphatase = 60-170 lU/L. + = Positive,  - = NFegative.<br>
The above example suggests that the polvherbal pharmaceutical composition brings about the clearance of hepatitis B virus infection and also is helpful in superadded hepatitis E virus infection.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
