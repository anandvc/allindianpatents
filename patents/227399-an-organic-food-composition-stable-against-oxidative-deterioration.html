ANTIOXIDANT FOR FATS, OILS AND FOOD<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the stabilization of edible organic substances subject to deterioration by oxidation. Antioxidants are of great importance in edible fats and fatty oils such as fatty acid glycerides, and in foods made with edible fats and fatty oils. The antioxidants are used to prevent or alleviate oxidative rancidity which causes undesirable flavors and odors, destroys fat-soluble vitamins and essential fatty acids, and produces toxicological effects. A food antioxidant should not impart undesirable characteristics, such as unpleasant odor or discoloration and advantageously has good carry-through which is the ability to survive baking or frying operations and provide improved keeping quality in food prepared from the stabilized edible organic substances.<br>
The art shows many methods of inhibiting lipid oxidation by adding fat-soluble antioxidants to the substrate. The art does not show the stablization of fats, oils, fatty foods and ingredients of foods employing one or more antioxidants selected from the group consisting of 3-arylbenzofuranones, long chain N,N-dialkylhydroxylamines, substituted hydroxylamines, nitrones, and amine oxides as defined hereinafter.<br>
Phenols are commonly employed as antioxidants to stabilize organic materials and substituted phenols have been found to have improved antioxidant effectiveness since the efficiency of the phenol group in terminating oxidation is affected by the nature of the ring substituents. Some known phenolic antioxidants are not suitable for use in food because they are toxic to higher forms of animal life. For example, p-aminophenol is highly toxic and is a skin irritant.<br>
Several phenolics have been used as antioxidants in foodstuffs, including butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Even these antioxidants are now being examined by regulatory agencies and consumer activists and these developments have urged the need to exploit new sources of antioxidants for use in food applications. Also propyl gallate (PG), t-butylhydroxyquinone (TBHQ), iso-ascorbic acid, chloro-iso-ascorbic acid and ascorbyl palmitate have been permitted for use in food applications.<br><br>
Young, U.S. Patent No. 2,654,722, discloses the use of acyl-p-aminophenols to stabilize solid organic materials, such as synthetic rubbers, which tend to deteriorate due to oxidation. The acyl substitutent in these antioxidants has at least three carbon atoms and can be employed as food stabilizers.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,492,349 to Doyle and Baxter discloses di-lower alkyl-alkoxy- and hydroxyacetanilides. The patent teaches that these compounds have analgesic and antipyretic properties and low toxicity. The compound of this patent of the formula<br><br>
wherein R3 is a hydrocarbon group may not have antioxidant activity since the effectiveness of p-aminophenols and other phenolics generally depends upon the presence of a free hydroxyl group, and the ethers and esters of these phenols generally have no significant effect.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,038,434 to Young discloses that certain N-acyl-2,6-dialkyl-p-aminophenols are highly effective antioxidants for use with edible organic substances.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,094,999 to Cohen and O'Connell discloses a food composition stabilized by the presence therein of a small proportion of a dialkyl pentaerythritol diphosphite.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,363,910 to Ambrus, Szabolesi and Hutas disclose the use of 2,2-dimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline derivatives useful as antioxidants to stabilize animal feedstuffs.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,084,289 to Shin, Han and Yi discloses a method for inhibiting the oxidation of edible oils and fats by forming a reverse miscelle by admixing a mixture of an aqueous solution containing tocopherol and ascorbic acid with a surfactant and said oils or fats.<br><br>
U.S. Patent No. 3,778,464 to Klemchuk discloses substituted hydroxylamine antioxidants of the formula R7R8NOH wherein R7 or R8 is alkyl containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, benzyl, chlorobenzyl, nitrobenzyl, benzhydryl or triephenylmethyl with the proviso that only one of R7 or R8 is alkyl and that R8 is hydrogen when R7 is benzhydryl or triphenylmethyl, or R7 and R8 taken together with the nitrogen atom form a heterocyclic group such as morpholino, piperidino or piperazino. The compounds are stated to be useful for organic substances including fats and oils of animal fats and foods made therewith or therein.<br>
Other antioxidants for food include those disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,527,552 to Todd, Jr. - green tea catechins; U.S. Patent No. 4,925,681 to Mai, Chambers and McDonald - extracts from black tea.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide food compositions having improved stability and containing antioxidant compositions which include one or more of the antioxidants disclosed herein.<br>
It is a related object of this invention to provide a method of stabilizing food products through the addition thereto of antioxidant compositions which include one or more of the antioxidants of the present invention.<br>
It is still another object of this invention to provide edible fat and oil compositions having improved stability and containing antioxidant compositions which include one or more of the antioxidants disclosed herein.<br>
It is a still further object of this invention to provide a method of stabilizing edible fat and oil compositions through the addition thereto of antioxidant compositions which include one or more of the antioxidants of the present invention.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is has now been found that a combination of one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of 3-arylbenzofuranones, long chain N,N-dialkylhydroxylamines, substituted hydroxylamines, nitrones, and amine oxides as defined hereinafter are highly effective antioxidants for use with edible organic substances subject to deterioration by oxidation.<br><br>
Detailed Description<br>
Edible organic substances that may be stabilized against oxidation include hydrocarbon-containing substances that are suitable for human or animal consumption, for example, frying oils and fats, potato flakes, bakery products, meat emulsions, precooked cereals, instant noodles, soybean milk, chicken products, emusion products such as sausage, mayonnaise and margarine, frozen fish, frozen pizza, cheese and animal foods.<br>
The antioxidants of this invention are extremely useful in the stabilization of fats, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, esters of fatty acids and fatty oils which may be essentially solid or liquid at room temperature, and may be hydrogenated or unhydrogenated as well as various foods containing or prepared in such products. The oils or fats may be naturally-occurring, such as animal or vegetable fats, or synthetic materials. Exemplary materials are tallow, lard, peanut oil, corn oil, cottonseed oil, olive oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, coconut oil, shortening, cooking oils, salad oils and dressings, mayonaisse, margarine and the like. The fatty acid portion of such materials generally has at least about 12 carbon atoms, say up to about 24 or more carbon atoms per ester site, and the ester portions are frequently glycerides, although the materials may be other types of esters of various mono and polyhydroxy alkyl alcohols. Generally, the ester portions of the molecule have less than about 12 carbon atoms, preferably less than about 6 carbon atoms, e.g. glycerides or other lower alkyl esters.<br>
The 3-arylbenzofuranones antioxidants of the present invention are for example those disclosed in U.S. patent Nos. 4,325,863; U.S. 4,388,244; U.S. 5,175,312; U.S. 5,252,643; U.S. 5,216,052; U.S. 5,369,159; U.S. 5,488,117; U.S. 5,356,966; U.S. 5,367,008; U.S. 5,428,162; U.S. 5,428,177; and U.S. 5,516,920; which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

Examples of structures of formula (XI) are where d and G2 are independently benzyl or substituted benzyl. It is also possible for each of G1f G2, and G3 to be the same residue. G1 and G2 may also independently be alkyl groups of 8 to 26 carbon atoms, for example alkyl groups of 10 to 26 carbon atoms. G3 may be an alkyl group of 1 to 22 carbon atoms, for example methyl or substituted methyl. Also, the present amine oxides include those wherein G1, G2, and G3 are the same alkyl groups of 6 to 36 carbon atoms. The aforementioned residues for G1( G2| and G3 are, for instance, saturated hydrocarbon residues or saturated hydrocarbon residues containing at least one of the aforementioned -O-, -S-, -SO-, -C02-, -CO-, or -CON- moieties. Those skilled in the art will be able to envision other useful residues for each of d, G2j and G3 without detracting from the present invention.<br>
The saturated amine oxides may also includes poly(amine oxides). By poly(amine oxides) is meant tertiary amine oxides containing at least two tertiary amine oxides per molecule. Illustrative poly(amine oxides), also called "poly(tertiary amine oxides)", include the tertiary amine oxide analogues of aliphatic and alicyclic diamines such as, for example, 1,4-diaminobutane; 1,6-diaminohexane; 1,1O-diaminodecane; and 1,4-diaminocyclohexane, and aromatic based diamines such as, for example, diamino anthraquinones and diaminoanisoles.<br>
Also included are tertiary amine oxides derived from oligomers and polymers of the aforementioned diamines. Useful amine oxides also include amine oxides attached to polymers, for example, polyolefins, polyacrylates, polyesters, polyamides, polystyrenes, and the like. When the amine oxide is attached to a polymer, the average number of amine oxides per polymer can vary widely as not all polymer chains need to contain an amine oxide. All of the aforementioned amine oxides may optionally contain at least one -O-, -S-,<br><br>
-SO-, -C02-, -CO-, or -CONG4- moiety. For instance, each tertiary amine oxide of the polymeric tertiary amine oxide may contain a C-i residue.<br>

The antioxidants of this invention are provided in compositions of this invention in a minor amount based on the weight of the edible organic substance, which amount is effective as an antioxidant, i.e. sufficient to stabilize, or retard the deterioration of, the edible organic substances to be stored and used to prepare foods in a normal and acceptable manner. The amount of antioxidant employed is generally any amount which may have a significant stabilizing effect. The amount of the compounds of this invention present may depend on the desired period of stability of the edible organic substance and the rate of deterioration of the edible organic substance. Thus, increased amounts of the compound of the present invention may be employed when an increased storage life of the edible organic substance before use is desired. Frequently, the compounds of the present invention will be provided in an amount of at least about 0.005%, preferably at least about 0.01%, by weight based on the weight of the edible organic substance up to a maximum of 5%, preferably up to about 1%. Concentrations of about 0.1 or more weight percent of the compounds of the present invention based on the edible organic substance are frequently employed in accordance with<br><br>
the invention. At concentrations in excess of about 5% by weight based on the weight of the edible organic substance, little benefit in increased stability is generally observed.<br>
The presence of the compounds of the present invention usually does not materially affect the manner in which the edible organic substance is formulated or in which it is used to prepare foods. The compounds of the present invention are preferably uniformly admixed in the edible organic substance. The compounds of the present invention may be added at the time of food preparation or may be intimately premixed with the edible fat or fatty oils to stabilize them prior to food preparation.<br>
It is often convenient to provide an edible fat or fatty oil composition in which the volume of the product can easily be handled, particularly when the composition must be transported for its use in food preparation. On the other hand, this invention is applicable to large food processing plants where large volumes of edible organic substance are stored and used in food preparation. The compounds of the present invention, due to their low toxicity and low concentrations which can be effectively employed, are especially suitable for stabilization of large volume doughs such as pastry, cake and biscuit premix such as are used in the baking industry. Also, use in other large scale food production plants such as pet food and other animal feeds are other applications where the compounds of the present invention are especially suitable.<br>
A combination of antioxidants is frequently used in edible fats and fatty oils and foods containing them. The compounds of the present invention may be utilized in conjunction with other food antioxidants to obtain desirable combinations of properties of stability and carry-through. The other food antioxidants can be used in an amount of from about 0.01 -0.1 % by weight based on the weight of the edible organic substance. They may also be combined with other food additives such as emulsifiers, suspension agents and colorings to provide the desired qualities in the final food product.

The following examples are for illustrative purposes only and are not to be construed to limit the scope of the instant invention in any manner whatsoever.<br>
Experimental Methods.<br>
Corn oil (3g) stripped of natural tocopherols was oxidized in stoppered 50ml Erlenmeyer flasks in a shaker oven (Lab-Line Instrument, Inc, Melrose Park, IL). Lipid oxidation was followed by measuring perioxide values colorimetrically, and hexanal by static headspace gas chromatography. Periodie values were determined by the ferric thiocyanate method (Chapman, R.A.; Mackay, K. The estimation of perioxides in fats and oils by the ferric thiocyanate method. J. Am. Oil Chem. Soc. 1949, 26, 36O-363), modified for safety reasons using choloform: methanol (3:1, v/v) instead of benzene:methanol as solvent. Propanol was determined by static headspace gas chromatography (Frankel, E.N, Formation of headspace volatiles by thermal decomposition of oxidized fish oils vs. oxidized vegetable oils. J. Am. Oil.<br><br>
Chem. Soc. 1993, 70, 767-772). Aliquots of oil samples (0.20 g) were weighed into 22-ml headspace vials, sealed and equilibrated at 80° C for 10 min in an HS-40 headspace autosampler. An aliquot of the headspace was then injected in an autosystem gas chromatograph (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT) equipped with a capillary DB-1701 column, 30 m long, 0.32 mm id, and 1 urn film thickness (J&amp;W Scientific, Folsom, CA). The injector and detector temperatures were 180 and 200°C, respectively. The oven temperature was controlled isothermally at 65°C. Hexanal was quantified by using standard solutions of known concentrations. All analyses were carried out in duplicate.<br>
The activity of the antioxidants was evaluated by determining peroxide values and hexanal using corn oil stripped of natural tocopherols after oxidation at 50 and 60°C. Peroxide values measurements are classical measurements of hydroperoxides that are generally accepted in antioxidant evaluations. This measure is useful at relatively laow levels of oxidation and the temperatures used in this study which are sufficiently mild so that hydroperoxides are not markedly decomposed. Hexanal determinations are measurements of hydroperoxide decomposition which may be more closely related to flavor deterioration and rancidity than peroxide values. Antioxidants in accordance with the present invention that were tested were (1) 042 - an N,N-di(alkyl)hydroxylamine produced by the direct oxidation of N,N-di(hydrogenated tallow)amine (commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals Corporation Irgastab® FS-042) and Irganox® HP-136 - 3-(3,4-dimethylphenyl)-5,7-di-tert-butyl-benzofuran-2-one. The antioxidants were tested at 100 and 200 ppm and compared with the commercial antioxidants BHA, BHT and TBHQ and commercial natural antioxidants tocopherol mixtures at the same concentration and a rosemary extract at 250 and 500 ppm.<br>
For the evaluations at 50°C, an endpoint was selected of 8 days for both peroxide values and hexanal contents during the propagation stage where the rate of oxidation is accelerated. The results of the evaluations are shown in Tables 1-2.<br>
For the evaluations at 60°C, an endpoint was selected of 3 days for peroxide values and 4 days for hexanal contents during the propagation stage where the rate of oxidation is accelerated. The results of the evaluations are shown in Tables 3-4.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
