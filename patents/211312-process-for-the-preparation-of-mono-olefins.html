PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF MONO-OLEFINS<br><br><br>
INDIAN PETROCHEMICALS CORPORATION LIMITED, an Indian company, incorporated under the Companies Act, 1956, of P.O. Petrochemicals, Vadodara 391 346, Gujarat, India,<br><br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of mono-olefins from the corresponding paraffins using a novel stable and selective dehydrogenation catalyst. The novel catalyst formulation of the invention consists of a noble metal component, a group IV A component, a rare earth group component, a group III A component, a group VIII component, an alkali component, a halogen component on an alumina support with a specific pore size distribution. The present invention also relates to a process for the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons from saturated hydrocarbons using the novel catalyst of the invention. Background of the invention<br>
Dehydrogenation of saturated hydrocarbons or paraffins specifically C2 - C20 paraffins, is an important petrochemical process through which a number of useful unsaturated hydrocarbons are manufactured. These unsaturated hydrocarbons are olefin monomers such as ethylene, propylene butenes, butadiene, styrene and straight chain mono olefins of carbon number range C6 - C20, which find extensive applications in the production of variety of plastics, synthetic rubber, detergents and a wide range of chemicals/intermediates of high utility. Furthermore, dehydrogenation of naphthenes and paraffins are the most important reactions during catalytic reforming processes, practiced worldwide for the production of aromatics (BTX) and high octane gasoline.<br>
Dehydrogenation of CIO - C16 n-paraffins is a reaction of prime importance<br>
particularly to the detergent industry for the manufacture of the active ingredients. The<br>
dehydrogenation process comprises of a complex series - parallel reaction network involving<br>
primary dehydrogenation, accompanied by a number of side chain reactions, like secondary<br>
dehydrogenation, aromatization, isomerisation, cracking and coking. The desired product, n-<br>
mono olefin, is formed in the first step, i. e. primary dehydrogenation. Selectivity towards n-<br>
2<br><br>
mono olefins is of paramount importance in the whole process. An additional drawback of prior art processes is the relatively short catalyst life of 4 to 6 weeks due to active metal sintering and coking.<br>
It is known to suppress accompanying reactions in order to maximise selectivity and increase catalyst life by thermodynamically limiting per pass conversion by the application of pressure and adding one of the reaction products, hydrogen. However, the overall performance in terms of activity, selectivity and stability as exhibited by the catalyst that actually dictate the optimum feasibility of this process. Activity can be defined in terms of per pass conversion as the "moles of paraffin converted per mole of paraffin fed", the term selectivity as "moles of n-mono olefin formed per mole of paraffin converted" and the term stability as "duration for which economically viable activity and selectivity are maintained during the course of the process". Hence, it is the nature of the support (non-acidic and highly porous), chemical components employed in making the catalyst and the method of preparation of the catalyst composite with unique physico-chemical properties, which enables it to evince these virtues. Hence, catalyst support, catalyst composition as well methods of catalyst preparation are of vital importance.<br>
Prior art catalyst compositions used for the dehydrogenation of paraffins consist primarily of the following metals or their combinations supported on a suitable porous, high surface area support such as gamma AI2O3<br>
1.	Noble metal (Pt, Re, Pd, Ir, Au, Os)<br>
2.	Noble metal + Group IV A metal (Ge, Sn, Pb)<br>
3.	Noble metal + Group IV A metal + Group III A metal (Ga; In, Ti)<br>
4  Noble metal + Other Group VIII metals (Fe, Co, Ni) and/or alloys thereof<br>
5. 3 above -+ Group 111 A metal or Group 111 B metal (Sc. Y, La. Ac) as primary active<br>
agents, with Group II B metal (Zn, Cd, Hg) as optional secondary activating agent<br>
6  Noble metal + Group VA metal (As, Sb, Bi) or VI A clement (S, Sc. Te).<br><br>
7.	1,2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 above + Group VIIA element (such as halogen in combined form).<br>
8.	1,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 above + Group I A metal or Group II A metal such as alkali or alkaline earth metals.<br>
9.	Any of 1 to 8 above + sulphur<br>
The references to Groups are based on the CAS version of the Periodic Table.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The preparation of the catalyst support of the present invention is different when compared to those described for prior art catalysts, as disclosed in US Patent 2,620,314 and CN 87101513A. In the present invention, pore size distribution is tailored using organic templating agents at the appropriate processing stage Simple addition of these templates to the alumina sol, as described in prior art (ACS monograph 184, by Chanakya Mishra) does not result in the desired pore size distribution<br>
Complete accessibility of the active components, located in pores to the reactanis,<br>
throughoui the course of the reaction/process time is highly essentia! for ihe realisation of the<br>
efficacy of the catalyst.   Active components present  on  micro  pores  may be accessible<br>
initially, but in the course of the reaction, the coke formed could block the micro pore mouth<br>
and thus impair the availability of the active sites for further reactions   Therefore, optimum<br>
14<br><br>
pore size distribution required for complete active metal accessibility to reactants during the course of catalyst life cycle is desired. This optimum pore size distribution should also render required support surface area in order to achieve good platinum dispersion (i.e. lower Pt crystallite size). Thus, tailoring of the pore structure is of prime importance.<br>
Manufacture of the spheroidal alumina support consists of three major steps, preparation of the sol, formation of the solid hydrogel spheres, and further processing to yield the final product.<br>
In the step of formation of the solid hydrogel spheres, an intermediate material consisting of a mixture of alumina sol and the gelling agent, both in the liquid state, are processes to yield hydrogel spheroids of the desired diameter. Conventional oil drop method as disclosed in US Patent 2, 620,314 is used for this step.<br>
In the prior art, the solid hydrogel spheres are generally processed through the following steps, oil aging, ammonia aging, washing, drying and calcination to obtain gamma alumina of the desired properties. However, the step of processing is modified in the present invention to obtain alumina support of the desired pore size distribution. In the present invention, hydrogels after aging in oil at 98°C for 6 hours, aging in 5% aqueous ammonia solution at a temperature of 98 to 100°C for another 6 hours are converted into pseudo-boehmite spheres. The pseudo-boehmite spheres are then washed with turbulent flow of hot water for 1 hour and allowed to soak in surfactant/templating agent such as PEG -400 (polyethylene glycol) or Brij35 (polyoxyethylene 4 lauryl ether) for 1 hour, followed by draining of the liquid before transferring it for drying. Due to the high boiling point of these templates, they remain in alumina matrix and protect the macro/meso pores from collapsing On controlled calcination in 5 % moisture containing air at 600°C for 4 hours, pseudo-boehmite spheres are converted into highlv meso and macro porous gamma alumina of the present invention<br><br><br>
The present invention results in a novel dehydrogenation catalyst useful for the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons from saturated hydrocarbons, the catalyst comprising i from 0.1 to 5.0 % by weight of a noble metal ii from 0.1 to 5 % by weight of a metal of Group IV A iii. from 0.1 to 6 % by weight of a metal of Group III A iv. from 0.1 to 1 % by weight of a rare earth v. from 0.1 to 10 % by weight of an alkali or alkaline earth element vi. from 0.01 to 10 % by weight of a halogen; and vii. from 0.1 to 5 % of a Group VIII metal selected from Fe, Co and Ni; incorporated within the spatial geometry of the high surface mesoporous support prepared, the proportions of the active elements being in terms of percentage by weight basis.<br>
The active elements incorporated into the support preferably comprise platinum as the noble metal, tin as the Group IV A metal, indium as the Group III A metal, lanthanum as the rare earth element, lithium as the alkali element, iron as the Group VTII metal and chlorine in combined form as the halogen. Chlorine is preferably present in an amount ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 % by weight calculated on an elemental basis and Fe is present in an amount or approximately 0.2 % by weight.<br>
The tin component may be incorporated in two parts during preparation, one part with the alumina sol and the other with the noble metal and promoter elements, and plays a dual role of an acidity attentuator and a promoter.<br>
The high surface mesoporous support comprises a spheroidal gamma alumina support<br>
with a diameter of 1.4 to 2.0 mm. a surface area in the range of from 150 to 220 m2/g, with<br>
bimodal narrow pore size distribution, water adsorption capacity in the range of from 1.4 to<br>
?5 ml/g. gamma crystallinity in the range of 60 to 80 % and a bulk density in the range of<br>
(_) 25 to 0.4 g/ml, preferably a bulk densits oi" 0.3 g/ml   Optionally the support may also<br>
comprise 0.1 to 5 v.t % of Fe, 0 I to 5 vA% of Sn and 0.1 to 1 wt% of La. The support may if<br>
16<br><br>
desired be soaked with surfactants/templates to prevent pore collapse upon drying or calcination and to impart visually improved sphericity.<br>
The active elements are incorporated into the support simultaneously in combination in a single step, or support stage - wise in any conventional manner. The active elements may also be incorporated individually or in combination into the support during the preparation of the said support. Alternatively, the active elements are incorporated into the support by impregnation on the finished support individually or in combination. This enables good selectivity in the dehydrogenation of paraffins to the corresponding mono-olefins.<br>
The active elements may be impregnated on to the finished support either simultaneously or successively in any order. The impregnation can be done by any conventional method such as equilibrium adsorption, incipient wetness, spraying, and deposition as a film from the vapour state, coprecipitation, co-gellation or a combination of any of the above methods. The choice of the impregnation procedure will determine the formation of the desired concentration gradient of the active elements within the catalyst composite. The procedure is chosen to result in a composite having a heterogeneous or shell type deposition of elements on the spatial geometry of the support or a homogenous or uniform deposition of the elements therein. The noble metal, metal of Group IV A, metal of Group III A, rare earth metal, alkali or alkaline earth metal and the metal of Group VIII are incorporated into the alumina support by co-precipitation or cogellation during the sol state in the preparation of the support Alternatively, the metals can also be impregnated into the finished support, simultaneously or successively in any order.<br>
Preferably, the noble metal, essentially platinum is incorporated into the support<br>
simultaneously with the Group IV A metal, essentially tin. The precursors for platinum are<br>
selected so as to be capable of decomposition on calcination. Preferred platinum precursors<br>
include hexachloro platinic acid, platinum acetyl acetonate, tetra-amino platinum nitrate.<br>
platinum chloride, etc., for tin the precursors tin (11) chloride dihydrate, tetra butyl tin. tin<br>
17<br><br>
acetate, tin acetylacetonate, etc, preferably tin (II) chloride dihydrate, for indium the precursors, indium (III) chloride, indium (III) nitrate, indium (III) acetylacetonate, indium acetate etc., preferably indium (III) nitrate, for iron the precursors, iron chloride, iron acetylacetonate, iron nitrate, iron acetate etc., preferably iron(III) nitrate, for lanthanum the precursors, lantanum (III) chloride, lanthanum (III) nitrate, lanthanum acetate, lanthanum (III) acetylacetonate, etc., preferably lanthanum (III) nitrate are used.<br>
Part of the Group IV A metal (Sn) and rare earth element (La) is incorporated into the support in a separate step prior to incorporation of the other elements. Part of the Group IV A metal and the Group III A metal, essentially indium, is incorporated along with the noble metal into the support. The alkali or alkaline earth metal, essentially lithium is preferably incorporated into the support prior to or simultaneously with the other elements.<br>
Incorporation of the active elements into the finished support by impregnation is conveniently effected employing an aqueous solvent, an organic solvent or mixture of the two, in the presence of anions. Such anions are preferably acidic and in particular chloride anions in a concentration range from 0.1% to 15% by weight preferably 5% to 10% by weight. This range is maintained in order to achieve the desired distribution of active elements within the spatial geometry of the support.<br>
The alumina support may be incorporated with iron as the Group VIII metal, tin as the Group 1I1A metal and Lanthanum as rare earth element at the sol stage of its preparation or in the first impregnation step.<br>
Preparatory" to impregnation, the aqueous and organic solutions employed for the<br>
purpose are preferably heated to a temperature of from 40°C to 70"C for a maximum of 30<br>
lainutes  Thereafter, the solutions are cooled to a temperature in the range of from 5°C to<br>
40"C and maintained at this range during the impregnation step     This procedure yields a<br>
catalyst  with uniform dispersion  of elements therein  and  ensures  minima!   loss  of the<br>
impregnated support through mechanical fracture, as a result of the heat of adsorption of the<br>
18<br><br>
impregnating solution. The quantum of the solution employed for impregnation by the incipient wetness technique ranges from 5% to 30% by weight in excess of the water adsorption capacity of the support, measured according to IS 9700 - 1981.<br>
After incorporation therein of the active elements, the catalyst composite is preferably dried in a dust-free environment at ambient temperature for 1 hour and thereafter in a flow of purified air at a temperature from 80°C to 170°C for 4 to 12 hours.<br>
The calcination of the dried catalyst composite can be effected in one or more stages at a temperature in the range of from 400°C to 600°C for a period of from 4 to 16 hours in an environment of circulating dry air.<br>
The calcined catalyst composite of the invention may also be subjected to dehalogenation treatment preferably by employing a counter current steam in order to reduce its halogen content to 0.01% to 5%, preferably 0.05% to 0.1%, by weight. It has been found convenient to dehalogenate the catalyst composite by subjecting it to steaming, employing a 20:80 steam-air mixture at a temperature of from 400 to 550°C. Alternatively, the composite can be dehalogenated by treating it at a temperature, from 10°C to 80°C, for a period of from 0.5 to 10 hours, with an aqueous solution of a weak base (example 0.5% NH4OH) or salt thereof or with an aqueous solution of an organic or inorganic compound, which undergoes hydrolysis to release such weak base, in the temperature range mentioned. This alternative dehalogenation treatment is the preferred one and the preferred temperature thereof is 40°C to S0°C. A preferred washing medium for the dehalogenated composite is demineral^ed water with the washing effected at a temperature of 40°C to 80"C for a period of 0 5 to 5 hours. The dehalogenated composite is then dried and further calcined.<br>
Reduction of catalyst composite prior to its use for catalytic dehydrogenation of paraffins is preferably done by subjecting the calcined catalyst to a reduction process by-treatment with dry hydrogen + nitrogen mixture of below LHL stream (containing less than<br>
10 ppm by wt.  moisture). The reduction is carried out with a GHSV (gas hourly space<br>
19<br><br>
velocity) of 1000 to 5000 h"1 at a temperature range from 300 to 600°C for a period of 2 to 16 h. Preferable temperature range for reduction is 450-500°C for 4 h and thereafter, catalytic composite is ready for use in the dehydrogenation of Cio to CM n-paraffins.<br>
Yet another feature of the novel catalytic composite and process of its preparation is that upon reduction by preferred method, substantially all the platinum component is reduced to zero oxidation state. The tin and indium components at least 20% of these are in metallic state, the rest being in oxidation states higher than zero. The component lithium, lanthanum and iron are in oxidised state.<br>
The invention will be illustrated in greater detail with reference to the accompanying drawings and examples. In such examples, unless otherwise specified, a chloride content of between 5 to 10 weight percent is maintained in the impregnating solution. The examples are intended to illustrate the invention and should not be considered to restrict the limitations on the broad scope of the invention as set out in the appended claims.<br>

The alumina support employed had a particle diameter distribution in the range of 1.0mm to 2.0mm with"65% gamma crystallinity, a BET surface area of 200 m2/g, a water adsorption capacity (WAC) of 1.9 ml/g, with the surface area distribution in various sizes of pores has been described in FIG-1, a bulk density of 0.29 g/ml, Fe content of 0.2 wt%, Sn content of 0.5 wt% and La content of 0.25 wt% . Fe [N03]3, SnCl2 .6H20, and La (N03")3 respectively were used as precursors and were incorporated into the support by adding them to the alumina sol.<br>
On the pie-formed alumina support, as the first step, Li was impregnated using an aqueous solution of LiNO;, , dried and calcined. This support is used for preparing catalyst of preferred embodiment of present invention A-l and   A-2.   At this stage a minimum acidity<br>
21<br><br>
has been observed and the same is manifested by very less activity towards 1-butene isomerisation. This has been studied by using butene-1 isomerisation reaction under identical conditions for all the catalysts. Butene-1 is fed to the reactor at the rate of 6ml/min along with 60 ml/min helium as diluent and the catalyst bed temperature was maintained at 350°C . In the case of virgin alumina the % conversion was 75 and cis to trans ratio was 0.65, whereas this values for Li impregnated bare alumina was 48% with cis/trans ratio of 0.56 (this support is used for catalyst "C" of prior art). In the case of the support used in the present invention , the butene-1 conversion was 40% with cis to trans ratio of 0.5. For the catalyst D of prior art catalyst considered in our example was having % butene conversion of 60% with 0.7 cis to trans ratio.<br>
Pt, Sn and In were impregnated in a second step with a solution containing H2PtCl6, S11CI2, In[N03]3 and HC1. The above conditions were favourable for the formation of a complex between Pt and Sn .

In the preparation of A-3, Li was impregnated first followed by drying and calcination. In second impregnation Sn , In and Pt has been co-impregnated onto lithiated alumina. The example A-3 is considered to illustrate the importance of preparation method and composition used in A-l and A-2.<br>

sol, then Li was impregnated onto the alumina support using an aqueous solution of L1NO3, followed by drying and calcination. Pt and In were impregnated together in a second step. The catalyst was then dried and calcined. It was then subjected to a dehalogenation step and the CI content reduced to 0.08 wt %.<br>
The results of evaluation of this catalyst formulation vis a vis Catalyst A showed that the initial activities of both catalysts were identical but Catalyst J tends to deactivate rapidly due to coking and agglomeration of platinum [fall in activity is about 1.25 times that of Catalyst A]. The results show that incoiporation of all Sn content in one step, prior to incorporation of Pt results in relatively poor stability.<br>
Certain catalyst formulations prepared according to the present invention were tested for their activity, stability and selectivity for dehydrogenation of C10-C13 n-paraffins under the reaction conditions described hereafter. All experimental tests were performed in a once-through, tubular, axial flow, packed bed reactor operated at near isothermal conditions. The catalysts were pre-reduced in a stream of hydrogen at 47Q°C..for 2 hours in all the cases. The performance of formulations of prior art has been presented along with formulation A-l and A-2 of present invention for comparison in fig 2 to 4 and tables 1,2 &amp; 3.<br>
