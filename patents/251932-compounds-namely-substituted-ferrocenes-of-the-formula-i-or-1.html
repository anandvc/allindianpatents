				<td>Ferrocenyl ligands for homogeneous, enantioselective hydrogenation catalysts<br>
The present invention relates to 1-secondary-phosphino-2-[(2'-secondary-phosphino-C-aromat-1'-yl)hydroxymethyl]ferrocenes as ligands for metal complexes, metal complexes of transition metals and these ligands, and the use of the metal complexes for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral, organic, unsaturated compounds having at least one carbon-carbon or heteroatom-carbon double bond.<br>
Chiral diphosphines have proven to be valuable ligands for catalytically active metal complexes used in homogeneous catalyses for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral, organic compounds to prepare intermediates for active compounds or to prepare active compounds directly, for example Pharmaceuticals, pesticides or aromas including fragrances. Over the course of time, many studies have shown that the effectiveness of the . catalysts in respect of optical selectivity, activity and conversion depends on the ligands and for the same substrate can vary more or less greatly depending on the ligand. It cannot be predicted which ligands give optimum results for a particular substrate. For this reason, it continues to be desirable to provide new ligands so as to provide a broad range from which it is possible to select ligands which enable most optimal conditions for a hydrogenation to be achieved for particular substrates.<br>
Among diphosphines having a ferrocene skeleton, 1-secondary-phosphino-2-{2'-secondary-phosphino-1'-benzyl)ferrocenes, for example, have proven to be valuable ligands for rhodium complexes for the enantioselective hydrogenation of prochiral, ethylenically unsaturated compounds. They have the trivial name TANIAPHOS and are described in WO 00/37478. The methylene group of the benzyl radical can, for example, be substituted by alkoxy or acyloxy. Substitution of the methylene group by hydroxyl is not described nor is a synthetic route which could lead to hydroxyl-substituted ligands described. WO 03/093285 describes 1 -secondary-phosphino-2-[(2'-secondary-phosphinophen-1 '-yl)-CrC4-alkoxy-methyl]ferrocenes in the form of diastereomers, with the mixture of strereoisomers being enriched in particular enantiomers. These compounds are obtained by replacement of a sulphoxide radical as chiral auxiliary group by a monohalophosphine in the presence of a strong lithium base, with hydroxybenzyl intermediates formed by addition of 1-secondary-phosphinobenzaldehyde onto the ferrocene sulphoxide being converted into the alkoxy derivatives beforehand.<br><br>
Although enriched mixtures of enantiomers were prepared by the method described in WO 03/093285, no hydroxyl-substituted derivatives have been prepared in this way. In Chirals CHIMICA OGGI/chemistry today (2000), pages 48 to 52, A. Borner states that the presence of hydroxyl groups in diphosphine ligands can influence the catalytic properties of metal complexes in respect of conversion and optical selectivity.<br>
In ferrocenes, metallation generates planar chirality. It has now been found that 1 -secondary-phosphino-2-[(2'-secondary-phosphinophen-1 '-yl)hydroxymethyl]ferrocenes are obtained in high yields and even, possibly, by means of simple chromatographic separation, in the form of pure enantiomers if a ferrocene having a chiral diaminophosphine group is firstly diastereoselectively metallated in the ortho position and then reacted with an ortho-secondary-phosphinobenzaldehyde or ortho-halobenzaldehyde. At this stage, the enantiomers can, if necessary, be separated in a simple manner by known methods. The further reaction to form the desired diphosphines can then be carried out in a manner known per se. Surprisingly, it has also been found that a high catalytic activity and very high optical yields comparable to the results obtained when using metal complexes having methoxy ligands are achieved in the hydrogenation of prochiral olefins using metal complexes of the hydroxy ligands. In addition, it has surprisingly been found that significantly higher optical yields are achieved in the hydrogenation of prochiral heteroatom-carbon double bonds, for example carbonyl groups, when using hydroxy ligands. A further advantage of the hydroxy ligands is that the hydroxyl group can easily be aikylated or acylated to produce known ligands.<br>
The invention firstly provides compounds of the formula I or I',<br>

The ferrocene diphosphines of the invention can be prepared by a novel process in which a regioselective and stereoselective ortho-metallation of ferrocenylmonophosphines having<br><br>
PN-bonded, chiral radicals represents the key step in the reaction sequence. The process is modular for the creation of different substituents on the two P atoms and gives high yields. In addtion, pure diastereomers can be prepared directly or pairs of easily separated diastereomers can be prepared, in each case in a simple manner and in high yields. The process is particularly useful for the preparation of the diphosphines of the invention on an industrial scale.<br>
The preparative process comprises the following steps. In a first process step, an essentially optically pure halodi(secondary-amino)phosphine containing chiral amino groups is provided. Such phosphines can be prepared in a simple manner by reacting PCI3 or PBr3 with about 2 equivalents of an optically pure, chiral, secondary amine in the presence of a halogen scavenger such as a tertiary amine (triethylamine). Cyclic secondary amines having a chiral C atom in the a position relative to the N atom are advantageously used. An example which may be mentioned is di[(S)- or (R)- a-methoxymethylpyrro!odino]chloro-    . phosphine of the formulae<br><br><br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br>
The halodi(secondary-amino)phosphines are reacted with unsubstituted or Rrsubstituted and metallated ferrocene, for example Li-ferrocene, to form compounds of the formula A<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br>
with borane being able to be introduced as protective group (for example by reaction with borane-dimethyl sulphide) prior to isolation. This intermediate is reacted in a process step a) with at least equivalent amounts of an alkyllithium, a magnesium Grignard compound or an aliphatic lithium secondary-amide or XaMg-secondary amide to form compounds of the formula B1 or B2,<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
where<br>
M is -Li or -MgX3 and Xa is Cl, Br or I. The compounds can be used in the next step without<br>
intermediate isolation.<br>
In a process step b), the compounds of the formula B1 or B2 are then reacted with at least two equivalents of an aldehyde of the formula<br>
(Ri)»T(o-X4&gt;C(=0)H,<br>
hereinafter more preferably a preferred phenylaldehyde of the formula C,<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br><br>
where<br>
RI and v have the meanings given above and X» is Cl, Br or I or secondary-phosphino XL to form compounds of the formula D1 or D2<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the formulae D1 and D2 are mixtures of diastereomers in which one can be present in excess. In this step, pure diastereomers of the formulae D3 and D4 or D5 and D6 can easily be obtained by, for example, chromatographic methods (by means of separation on silica gels) or crystallization methods:<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In a next process step c), the borane group, if present, is removed from one of the compounds of the formulae D1 to D6, then the secondary amino radical is eliminated by means of HCI or HBr to form a -PCIa group or -PBr2 group. The intermediate products can be isol.ated or directly reacted further to form secondary, acyclic or cyclic phosphine groups from the PCI2 or PBr2 groups.<br>
For this purpose, the Cl or Br atoms are reacted with at least two equivalents of an organometallic compound or one equivalent of a bisorganometallic compound (Grignard reagents) and replaced by a hydrocarbon radical to form an acyclic or cyclic secondary phosphine of the formulae E1 to E6 in a known manner in a process step d):<br>
(Figure Remove) <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
When Xi is secondary phosphine Xi, this step leads directly to the compounds of the invention.<br>
The PCI2 or -PBr2 groups can be hydrogenated in a simple manner to form primary phosphine groups. Primary phosphine groups can be converted into cyclic phosphine groups in a manner known per se by means of known alkylating agents such as cyclic sulphates, sulphonates or phosphonates or open-chain disulphonates.<br>
When Xt is Cl, Br or I, one of the compounds of the formulae E1 to E6 is reacted with at least 1 equivalent of a lithium alkyl and then with at least 1 equivalent of secondary-phosphine halide (X1 halide, halide such as Cl or Br) in a further process step e) to form a compound according to the invention. As an alternative, compounds of the formulae E1 to E6 can also be reacted with previously formed lithium secondary-phosphide Li-X^ Before these reactions, the OH group is made inert, for example by metallation with a metal hydride such as LiH, NaH or KH.<br>
Lithium alkyl in the process step a) can be, for example, Li(Ci-C4-alkyl) or Li-phenyl, e.g. Li-methyl, Li-n-, Li-s- or Li-t-butyl.<br><br>
Aliphatic lithium secondary-amide or X3Mg secondary-amide in step a) can be derived from secondary amines having from 2 to 18 carbon atoms, preferably from 2 to 12 carbon atoms and particularly preferably from 2 to 10 carbon atoms. The aliphatic radicals bound to the N atom can be alkyl, cycloalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl, or N-heterocyclic rings having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably from 5 to 7 carbon atoms, can be present. Examples of radicals bound to the N atom are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, n-butyl. pentyl, hexyl, cyclopentyl, cyclo-hexyl and cyclohexylmethyl. Examples of N-heterocyclic rings are pyrrolidine, piperidine, morpholine, N-methylpiperazine, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine and azanorbornane.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, Li-alkyI or Li-phenyl is used in process step a).<br>
The metallation of aromatics involves known reactions as are described, for example, by M. Schlosser (editor) in Organometallics in Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons (1994) or in Jonathan Clayden Organolithiums: Selectivity for Synthesis (Tetrahedron Organic Chemistry Series), Pergamon Press (2002).<br>
For the purposes of the invention, "at least equivalent amounts" refers to the use of from 1 to 1.2 equivalents of an Li-alkyI or magnesium Grignard compound, or an aliphatic lithium secondary-amide or X3Mg-secondary-amide per reacting =CH group in the cyclopentadienyl ring.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out at low temperatures, for example at from 20 to -100"C, preferably from 10 to -50°C. The reaction time is from about 2 to 5 hours. The reaction is advantageously carried out under an inert protective gas, for example nitrogen or a noble gas such as argon.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of inert solvents. Such solvents can be used alone or as a combination of at least two solvents. Examples of solvents are aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and also open-chain or cyclic ethers. Specific examples are petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl or diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
In the reaction in process step b), "at least equivalent amounts" refers, for the purposes of the invention, to the use of from 1 to 1.2 equivalents of aldehyde of the formula C per<br><br>
reacting =CM group in the ferrocene. However, ft is also possible to use a substantial excess of up to 2.5 equivalents.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out at low temperatures, for example at from 20 to ~100CC, preferably from 0 to -80°C. The reaction is advantageously carried out under an inert protective gas, for example a noble gas such as argon or else nitrogen. After addition of the compound C, the mixture is advantageously allowed to warm to room temperature or is warmed to elevated temperatures, for example up to 100°C and preferably up to 50°C, and is stirred for some time under these conditions to complete the reaction.<br>
The reaction is advantageously carried out in the presence of inert solvents. Such solvents can be used alone or as a combination of at least two solvents. Examples of solvents are aliphatic, cydoaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and also open-chain or cyclic ethers. Specific examples are petroleum ether, pentane, hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, metnyloyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene, diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, tert-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl or diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
Isolation of the compounds of the formulae D1 to D6 can be carried out by methods known per se, for example extraction, filtration and distillation. After isolation, the compounds can be purified, for example by distillation, recrystallization or by chromatographic methods.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the reaction of the metallated and in particular lithiated ferrocenes with the prochiral compound C leads to a very high diastereoselectivity in respect of the planar chirality (ferrocene skeleton) and in addition to a significant diastereoselectivity in respect of the chirality on the prochiral carbon atom. On introduction of compound C, essentially only one pair of diastereomers in respect of planar chirality is formed, while four diastereomers are possible, and it is often also observed that one diastereomer of the diastereomeric pair is predominantly formed. Pure diastereomers can, if necessary at all, then easily be obtained in this step by separation by means of recrystallization or, in particular, chromatographic methods.<br>
The reactions of the process steps c) to e) are known per se and are described in the literature.<br><br>
The elimination of the borane group can, for example, be effected by addition of reagents such as secondary amines having Ci-C4-alkyl groups, morpholine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]-undec-7-ene (DBU), 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, sufficiently long stirring at temperatures of from 20 to 100°C and removal of the volatile constituents, advantageously under reduced pressure. Methods for the removal of borane are described, for example, by M. Ohff et al. in Synthesis (1998), page 1391. The removal of the borane group only in the last reaction step offers the advantage that reaction-sensitive groups remain protected.<br>
The formation of -PCI2 or -PBr2 groups is likewise known and is described, for example, by A. Longeau et al. in Tetrahedron: Asymmetry, 8 (1997), pages 987-990. Reagents used are advantageously organic solutions of HCI or HBr in, for example, ethers, which are added at low temperatures (for example from -20 to 30°C) to dissolved compounds of the formula VII, IX or XI with or without a borane group.<br>
The Grignard reagents used in process step d) can be Li-, CIMg-, BrMg- or IMg-hydro-carbons which are generally added in excess, for example up to 5 equivalents per halogen atom. The reaction is carried out in solution, with solvents as mentioned above for the metallation being able to be used. The reaction can be carried out at temperatures of from -80 to 80°C.<br>
The reactions for introducing an acyclic or cyclic secondary-phosphine group in process step e) are known per se and are illustrated in the examples.<br>
In the compounds of the formulae E1 to E6, the OH group can, if desired, be converted into the group -OR2, for example by means of silyl halides, substituted acid derivatives such as esters and halides, carbonates or isocyanates. Large numbers of reagents for introducing these groups are known. As an alternative, the compounds of the formulae la to If in which R2 is H can be converted in the same way into new ligands in which R2 has the meanings given for the formula I with the exception of hydrogen. Known ligands in which RZ is alky! or unsubstituted acyl can be prepared in an analogous way. Compounds according to the invention can also be bound covalently to a polymer in a known manner via the OH group (R2 is H), either directly or via a bridging group, to immobilize and produce catalysts which can be separated off.<br><br>

If prochiral unsaturated organic compounds are used, a very high excess of optical isomers can be induced in the synthesis of these organic compounds and a high chemical conversion can be achieved in short reaction times. The achievable enantioselectivities and catalyst activities are excellent.<br>
The invention further provides metal complexes of metals selected from the group of TM8 metals with one of the compounds of the formula I or I' and preferably la to If as ligands.<br>

Yamamoto (Eds.), Comprehensive Asymmetric Catalysis I to III, Springer Verlag, Berlin, 1999, and references cited therein).<br><br>
The metal complexes of the invention are homogeneous catalysts or catalyst precursors which can be activated under the reaction conditions, and can be used for asymmetric addition reactions of prochiral, unsaturated, organic compounds.<br>
The metal complexes can, for example, be used for the asymmetric hydrogenation (addition of hydrogen) of prochiral compounds having carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom double bonds. Such hydrogenations using soluble homogeneous metal complexes are described, for example, in Pure and Appl. Chem., Vol. 68, No. 1, pp. 131-138 (1996). Preferred unsaturated compounds to be hydrogenated contain the groups C=C, C=N and/or C=O. According to the invention, metal complexes of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium are preferably used for the hydrogenation.<br>
The invention further provides for the use of the metal complexes of the invention as homogeneous catalysts for preparing chiral organic compounds by asymmetric addition of hydrogen onto a carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom double bond in prochiral organic compounds.<br>
The invention also provides a process for preparing chiral organic compounds by asymmetric addition of hydrogen onto a carbon-carbon or carbon-heteroatom double bond in prochira! organic compounds in the presence, of a catalyst, which is characterized in that the addition reaction is carried out in the presence of catalytic amounts of at least one metal complex according to the invention.<br>
Preferred prochiral, unsaturated compounds to be hydrogenated can contain one or more, identical or different groups C=C, C=N and/or C=O, in open-chain or cyclic organic compounds, with the groups C=C, C=N and/or C=O being able to be part of a ring system or being exocyclic groups. The prochiral unsaturated compounds can be alkenes, cycloalkenes, heterocycloalkenes or open-chain or cyclic ketones, a,p-diketones, a- or |3-ketocarboxylic acids or their a.p-ketoacetals or-ketals, esters and amides, ketimines and ketohydrazones.<br>
Some examples of unsaturated organic compounds are acetophenone, 4-methoxy-acetophenone, 4-trifluoromethylacetophenone, 4-nitroacetophenone, 2-chloroacetophenone, corresponding unsubstituted or N-substituted acetophenonebenzylimines, unsubstituted or substituted benzocyclohexanone or benzocyclopentanone and corresponding imines, imines<br><br>
from the group consisting of unsubstituted or substituted tetrahydroquinoline, tetrahydro-pyridine and dihydropyrrole, and unsaturated carboxylic acids, esters, amides and salts such as a-and, if appropriate, p-substituted acrylic acids or crotonic acids. Preferred carboxylic acids are those of the formula<br>
Roi-CH=C(R02)-C(O)OH<br>
and also their salts, esters and amides, where R0i is d-Ce-alkyl, unsubstituted C3-CB-cycloalkyl or cycloalkyl substituted by from 1 to 4 CrC6-alkyl, d-C6-alkoxy, Ci-C6-alkoxy-d-C4-alkoxy groups, or unsubstituted C6-Ci0-aryl or C6-Cio-aryl substituted by from 1 to 4 d-Ce-alkyl, d-C6-alkoxy, Ci-C6-alkoxy-CrC4-alkoxy groups, preferably phenyl, and R02 is linear or branched d-CB-alkyl (for example isopropyl), or cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl or phenyl which may each be unsubstituted or substituted as defined above or protected amino (for example acetylamino).<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out at low or elevated temperatures, for example temperatures of from r20 to 150°C, preferably from -10 to 100°C, and particularly preferably from 10 to 80°C. The optical yields are generally better at lower temperature than at higher temperatures.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or superatmospheric pressure. The pressure can be, for example, from 105 to 2x107 Pa (pascal). Hydrogenations can be carried out at atmospheric pressure or at superatmospheric pressure.<br>
Catalysts are preferably used in amounts of from 0.0001 to 10 mol%, particularly preferably from 0.001 to 10 mol% and very particularly preferably from 0.01 to 5 mol%, based on the compound to be hydrogenated.<br>
The preparation of the ligands and catalysts and also the hydrogenation can be carried out in the absence of solvents or in the presence of an inert solvent, with one solvent or mixtures of solvents being able to be used. Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, dichloroethane and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile,<br><br>
propionitrile, benzonitrile), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylene glycol monomethyl or monoethyl ether), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone), carboxylic esters and lactones (ethyl or methyl acetate, valerolactone), N-substituted lactams (N-methylpyrrolidone), carboxamides (dimethylamide, dimethylformamide), acyclic ureas (dimethylimidazoline) and suIphoxides and sulphones (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, tetramethylene sulphoxide, tetramethylene sulphone) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether) and water. The solvents can be used alone or as a mixture of at least two solvents.<br>
The reaction can be carried out in the presence of cocatalysts, for example quaternary ammonium halides (tetrabutylammonium iodide), and/or in the presence of protic acids, for example mineral acids (cf., for example, US-A-5,371,256, US-A-5,446,844 and US-A-5,583,241 and EP-A-0 691 949). The presence of fluorinated alcohols such as 1,1,1-trifluoroethanol can likewise promote the catalytic reaction.<br>
The metal complexes used as catalysts can be added as separately prepared, isolated compounds or can be formed in situ prior to the reaction and then be mixed with the substrate to be hydrogenated. It can be advantageous to add additional ligands in the reaction using isolated metal complexes or to use an excess of the ligands in the in-situ preparation. The excess can be, for example, from 1 to 6 mol, preferably from 1 to 2 mol, based on the metal compound used for the preparation.<br>
The process of the invention is generally carried out by placing the catalyst in a reaction vessel and then adding the substrate, if appropriate reaction auxiliaries and the compound to be added on, and then starting the reaction. Gaseous compounds to be added on, for example hydrogen or ammonia, are preferably injected under pressure. The process can be carried out continuously or batchwise in various types of reactor.<br>
The chiral organic compounds which can be prepared according to the invention are active substances or intermediates for the preparation of such substances, for example in the field of preparation of aromas and fragrances, Pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.<br>

Triethylamine (11.97 g, 118.25 mmol, 2.20 equivalents) is added dropwise and (S)-methoxymetnylpyrrolidine (12.69 g, 110,19 mmol, 2.05 equivalents) is subsequently slowly added dropwise. During the addition, the formation of a white precipitate is observed. The ice bath is removed and the suspension obtained is stirred overnight (14 h) at room temperature (RT). The white precipitate formed is filtered under argon by means of an invertible frit filter and washed with dry THF (2 x 25 ml).

The solution is cooled to -78°C, and f-butyllithium (1.5 M in hexane; 71.67 ml, 107.50 mmol, 2.00 equivalents) is then added dropwise over a period of 45 minutes. The solution is stirred at -78°C for 1.5 hours and admixed with heptane (75 ml). After the precipitate formed has settled, the supernatant solution is removed at-78°C under argon by means of a transfer needle. The precipitate is washed with heptane (60 ml) at -78°C and the washings are removed again by means of a transfer needle. This procedure is repeated three times. The precipitate obtained is dissolved in dry THF (50 ml) and a solution of the halophosphine prepared as described in a) (53.75 mmol, 1.00 equivalent) in THF (200 ml) is added at -78°C over a period of 1.5 hours.

This results in precipitation of a yellow solid. s-Butyllithium (1.3 M in cyclohexane; 1.76 ml, 2.29 mmol, 1.05 equivalents) is added dropwise. This results in the yellow solid gradually going into solution, the solution becomes orange-red and an orange solid precipitates after about 30 minutes. After stirring at -30°C for 2 hours, 2-bromobenzaldehyde (485 mg, 2.62 mmol, 2.2 equivalents) is added dropwise, the cooling bath is removed and the suspension is stirred overnight (14 h) while warming to RT.

C^ Preparation of metal complexes<br>
Genera! method: In a Schlenk vessel filled with argon, a catalyst solution is prepared by dissolving, for example, 4.73 (0.01265 mmol) of [Rh(norbornadiene)23BF4 or another metal complex and 8.96 mg (0.0133 mmol) of diphosphine ligand in 5 ml of degassed methanol.<br><br>
P) Use examples<br>
Example D1: Hydrogenation of methyl trans-acetamidocinnamate 0.555 g (2.53 mmol) of methyl trans-acetamidocinnamate and 5 ml of degassed methanol are introduced in succession into a Schlenk vessel filled with argon. A catalyst solution consisting of 4.73 g (0.01265 mmol) of [Rh(norbornadiene)2]BF4, 8.77 mg (0.0133 mmol) of ligand A and 5 ml of degassed methanol is prepared in a second Schlenk vessel filled with argon. This solution and the catalyst solution are then transferred in succession by means of a steel capillary into a 50 mi glass reactor filled with argon. The ratio of substrate/catalyst (sic) is 200. The reactor is closed and a pressure of 1.05 bar is set by means of 4 flushing cycles (pressurization to 1 bar of hydrogen). The autoclave is thermostated at 25°C and the reaction is started by switching on the stirrer. The reactor is stirred for 1 hour. After opening the reactor, a reddish reaction solution is isolated. The conversion is quantitative (determined by means of GC and 1H-NMR). Removal of the solvent on a rotary evaporator gives a quantitative yield of the methyl ester of (S)-N-acetylphenylalanine having an enantiomeric purity of 99.1% ee (determined by means of GC; column: Chirasil-L-Val.).<br>
