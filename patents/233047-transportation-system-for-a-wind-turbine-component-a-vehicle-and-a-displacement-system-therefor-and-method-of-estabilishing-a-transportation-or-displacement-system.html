				<td>TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FOR A WIND TURBINE COMPONENT, A<br>
VEHICLE AND A DISPLACEMENT SYSTEM THEREFOR, AND METHOD OF<br>
ESTABLISHING A TRANSPORTATION OR DISPLACEMENT SYSTEM<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The invention relates to a transportation system for a wind turbine component transported<br>
by vehicle on road, rail or sea, a vehicle and a displacement system therefor and a method<br>
of establishing a transportation or displacement system and use thereof.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Typically, wind turbine components such as nacelles or tower sections are transported to<br>
the mounting site by means of large trucks capable of carrying the relevant load on a<br>
standard trailer. Before the truck transportation, the components may be transported from<br>
the central wind turbine production plant by ship or train.<br>
As the wind turbine components are quite large and heavy as well as quite irregular in<br>
shape, the transportation usually requires a lot of transportation space e.g. on the ship<br>
deck. Further, the components often involve special handling and handling equipment<br>
due to the irregular shape.<br>
One of the objects of the invention is to establish transportation for wind turbine<br>
components without the above-mentioned disadvantage.<br>
It is another object of the invention to create a standardised transportation form in which<br>
the natural and rigid strength of the components are used in order to enhance the<br>
transportation efficiency.<br>
A further object of the invention is to create a transportation form that may enter a system<br>
performing transportation on the same conditions as other standardized goods.<br>
The invention<br>
The invention relates to a transportation system for a wind turbine component such as a<br>
wind turbine nacelle or a section of a tubular wind turbine tower transported by vehicle<br>
on road, rail or sea, said system comprising a wind turbine component with a rigid<br>
structure, characterised in that said at least two standardisation means are directly or<br>
indirectly connected to the rigid structure of said wind turbine component; and said at<br>
least two standardisation means define a space enclosing said component.<br>
Hereby, a transportation system for wind turbine components is established without the<br>
above-mentioned disadvantage. Especially, it is advantageous that the standardisation is<br>
achieved without enclosing the wind turbine component in separate outer transportation<br>
walls.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said rigid structure comprises the bolted, welded or molded<br>
machine frame of a nacelle including horizontal, vertical and / or diagonal beams.<br>
Hereby, it is possible to establish a rigid transportation system without using separate<br>
outer transportation walls.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said rigid structure comprises a tubular or similar<br>
structure of a wind turbine nacelle or tower section.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said system comprises two standardisation means<br>
mounted in opposite ends of the wind turbine component. Hereby, it is possible to<br>
enclose and suspend the component in a standardized space e.g. allowing the<br>
component to be stacked with other standardized transport systems.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said standardisation means defines a space<br>
corresponding to a standardized container in length, such as the length of 20 to 40<br>
feet containers or a standard oversized shipping container. In an even further aspect<br>
of the invention, said standardisation means defines a space corresponding to a<br>
standardized container in length and width, such as the length and width of 20 to 40<br>
feet containers of a standard oversized shipping container. Hereby, it is possible to<br>
transport the component as a standard transportation system together with other<br>
transportation systems e.g. on a ship or a train. Especially on a ship it is important<br>
that the transported items are standardized in order to efficiently use the storage<br>
space of the ship Further, the standardized size allows the transportation system to<br>
be handled by the normal handling equipment such as cranes and lashing equipment.<br>
Even further, the wind turbine components may more efficiently be stacked<br>
temporarily in storage facilities e.g. in connection with the production plant before<br>
transportation.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said standardisation means includes an upper and<br>
lower standardisation beam. Hereby, it is possible to establish a space defined by<br>
upper and lower borders being said upper and lower standardisation beams. The<br>
upper and lower beams of the transportation system may be positioned against and<br>
used as contact surface for other transportation systems e.g. similar transportation<br>
systems for wind turbine components or standard shipping containers.<br>
It shall be emphasised.that the upper and lower border/beams define a space that<br>
encloses the wind turbine component totally ensuring that other transportation<br>
systems lay against the upper and lower beams and not the component.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said standardisation means comprises connection<br>
means in connecting to the wind turbine component. Hereby, an advantageous<br>
embodiment of the invention has been achieved.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said connection means are at least three<br>
connection arms or a circular lift adaptor. Hereby it is possible to achieve the<br>
necessary rigidity in the connection between the nacelle and the standardization<br>
means.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, said connection means are directly<br>
connected to the nacelle machine frame e.g. with adaptors or furnishings and bolts,<br>
or indirectly e.g. through the hub opening or the yaw foundation of the nacelle.<br>
Hereby, it is easy and quick to establish the connection between the nacelle and the<br>
standardization means at the beginning of the transportation. Further, it is easy and<br>
quick to remove the means at the end of the transportation.<br>
The invention also relates to at least one standardisation means being directly or<br>
indirectly connected to the rigid structure of said wind turbine component,<br>
said at least one standardisation means further being connected to said trailers in one<br>
or more flexible connections,<br>
where said at least one standardisation means defines a space enclosing said<br>
component.<br>
Hereby, a preferred embodiment of the invention is achieved.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said one or more flexible connections comprise hinged<br>
connections between the standardisation means and the two trailers. Hereby, a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention is achieved.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said one or more flexible connections further<br>
comprise at least one lift actuator. Hereby, a preferred embodiment of the invention<br>
is achieved.<br>
In an even further aspect of the invention, said at least one lift actuator include a first<br>
lift actuator flexibly connecting the trailer with the tipper section of said at least one<br>
standardisation means.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said first lift actuator includes gripping means<br>
with gripping jaws for gripping said standardisation means. Hereby, it is easy and<br>
quick to establish the connection between the standardization means and the vehicles<br>
at the beginning of the transportation. Further, it is easy and quick to remove the<br>
means at the end of the transportation simply by releasing the grip;<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said gripping means with gripping jaws engages with<br>
an inner gripping edge of said circular lift adaptor or the lower edge of the upper<br>
standardization beam. Hereby, the standardization means such as the lift adaptor is<br>
firmly suspended in a vertical plane ensuring that the means do not move vertically<br>
during the transportation.<br>
In a further aspect of the invention, said first lift actuator is suspended with a vertical<br>
lift frame. The vertical lift frame ensures that the lift actuator is not pressed<br>
downwards e.g. due to vibrations from the transportation.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, said at least one lift actuator includes a second lift<br>
actuator connected at one end to said lift frame and ends in a contact face at the<br>
opposite end. The contact face is forced against the standardization means ensuring a<br>
firm and durable connection between the vehicle and the means.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said contact face engages with an inner surface of said<br>
circular lift adaptor or the lower edge of the upper standardization beam. Hereby, a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention is achieved.<br>
The invention also relates to a displacement system for a wind turbine component<br>
such as a wind turbine nacelle or a section of a tubular wind turbine tower, said<br>
system comprising gripping means for engaging with a wind turbine component<br>
including a rigid structure, displacement means for displacing said wind turbine<br>
component in which said engagement and displacement means are connected, where<br>
said displacement system further being connected to at least one standardisation<br>
means, said standardisation means also being directly or indirectly connected to the<br>
rigid structure of said wind turbine component, e.g. in one or more flexible<br>
connections,<br>
where said at least one standardisation means defines a space enclosing said<br>
component<br>
With the displacement system it is possible to displace a wind turbine component in<br>
an advantageous way.<br>
In an aspect of the invention, said at least one hydraulic actuator suspending one or<br>
more of the wheels in relation to the trailer frame such as the suspension system of a<br>
trailer or vehicle. Hereby it is possible to displace the wind turbine component by<br>
using integrated hydraulic systems of the trailers e.g. the suspension system allowing<br>
the trailer frame to be lowered in relation to the wheels or lift actuators forcing the<br>
wind turbine component in an upward direction.<br>
The invention also relates to a method of establishing a transportation or displacement<br>
system for a wind turbine component such as a wind turbine nacelle or a section of a<br>
tubular wind turbine tower, said method comprising the steps of<br>
positioning at least one standardisation means in front of the wind turbine component,<br>
and<br>
directly or indirectly connecting said at least one standardisation means to the rigid<br>
structure of said wind turbine component.<br>
Hereby it is possible to establish a transportation or displacement method for the wind<br>
turbine component that is especially advantageous.<br>

component, and<br>

embodiment of the transportation system.<br>
Detailed description<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a modern wind turbine 1 with a tower 2 and a wind turbine nacelle 3<br>
positioned on top of the tower. The wind turbine rotor 5, comprising three wind<br>
turbine blades, is connected to the nacelle through the low speed shaft which extends<br>
out of the nacelle front.<br>
As illustrated in the figure, wind beyond a certain level will activate the rotor due to<br>
the lift induced on the blades and allow it to rotate in a perpendicular direction to the<br>
wind. The rotation movement is converted to electric power, which is usually<br>
supplied to the transmission grid as known by skilled persons within the area.<br>
The different components of a wind turbine are usually transported separately to the<br>
site of mounting and assembled here e.g. the different tower sections, the nacelle and<br>
the wind turbine blades.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates a cross-section of a wind turbine nacelle. The illustrated nacelle 3<br>
comprises a basic structure represented by a bolted, welded or molded machine<br>
frame 6 on which the main structures of the wind turbine are founded or suspended.<br>
Such main structures or components may e.g. include the hub 4, the generator, the<br>
yaw mechanism including the yaw foundation 8, the rotor shaft, gear means, etc. The<br>
machine frame is also provided with cover plates 10, such as steel or glass fiber<br>
plates, in order to establish the exterior surface of the nacelle. The cover plates 10 are<br>
only illustrated partly (in this and some of the following figures) in order to reveal<br>
the interior of the nacelle including the machine frame 6.<br>
The nacelle 3 comprises upper and lower engagement arrangements 7a and 7b in the<br>
four corners of the rear side of the nacelle. The arrangements allow external<br>
structures to engage with the bolted, welded or molded machine frame 6 after<br>
entering the nacelle through openings in the cover plates 10. The engagement<br>
arrangements are either included in or fitted to the basic structure.<br>
Moreover, the nacelle 3 is mounted with a sub-cover 9 adapted for protecting the<br>
sub-portion of the nacelle 3 against scratches etc. during transportation and storage.<br>
Another embodiment of a wind turbine nacelle may comprise the use of a tubular or<br>
a similar shaped nacelle. The tubular nacelle may be constructed with less or no<br>
internal machine frame structure in which the surface plates establish the necessary<br>
strength in the frame structure.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates different sections of the basic structure of the nacelle 3. The<br>
structure of the figure only comprises the leftmost section of the above mentioned<br>
machine frame 6 ending just before the foundation 8 of the yaw mechanism (for<br>
illustrative purpose). The foundation 8 is suspended to the machine frame 6, together<br>
with other main structures or components (not illustrated in the figure). The sub-<br>
cover 9 is suspended to the yaw foundation 8 or directly to the machine frame 6.<br>
The machine frame 6 is illustrated as horizontal steel I-beams 6a defining the sides of<br>
the nacelle. The frame preferably comprises at least four horizontal steel I-beams as<br>
is apparent from fig. 2 and 3. A number of vertical and diagonal steel beams 6b, 6c<br>
connect the different horizontal beams in order to strengthen the machine frame<br>
structure.<br>
Further, the figure comprises a ring illustrating the front opening 11 in the nacelle for<br>
the later receiving of the hub 4. The opening 11 is connected to the machine frame<br>
directly at the beam ends or indirectly e.g. through the yaw foundation. The dotted<br>
plate 12 beneath the opening 11 schematically illustrates a section of the floor of the<br>
nacelle.<br>
Fig.. 4 illustrates a preferred embodiment of transportation according to the invention<br>
of a wind turbine nacelle. The embodiment includes a truck 13 pulling two trailers in<br>
which the trailers are a first and second connection vehicle 14, 15 for a wind turbine<br>
component. Each of the trailers comprises a trailer lift frame 19,20 in order to lift the<br>
wind turbine component from the ground.<br>
The wind turbine component may e.g. be a nacelle 3, a tower section or a hub 4 that<br>
is suspended between the two vehicles. The present embodiment is a nacelle (without<br>
the hub mounted) that is suspended between the two vehicles.<br>
The suspending is preferably achieved with a first and second frame standardization<br>
means 16,17 engaging the wind turbine component and the trailers. The engaging of<br>
the illustrated nacelle may be directly or indirectly to the machine frame 6. The<br>
indirectly connection to the machine frame may be established by using the nacelle<br>
opening or the yaw foundation as connection points as they both are mounted on the<br>
machine frame.<br>
The rear connection between the machine frame 6 and the second frame<br>
standardization means 17 is preferably achieved by entering steel beams at the<br>
corners through small openings in the nacelle cover plates 10. Inside the nacelle the<br>
steel beams are connected to the flanges of the horizontal I beams with adaptors or<br>
furnishings bolted to both of the beams in question.<br>
The front connection may also be achieved by beams entering the nacelle through<br>
small openings in the front of the nacelle in order to meet the machine frame 6.<br>
However, the preferred connection is achieved by a connection to or through the<br>
nacelle opening. One type of connection may be beams entering the opening in order<br>
to be directly or indirectly connected to the machine frame.<br>
Another type may be a circular adaptor meeting the inside of the opening and bolted<br>
e.g. to the outer hub connection flange of the nacelle in which the nacelle may<br>
comprise a machine frame or be a tubular nacelle as described above.<br>
Interconnecting the means with temporary transportation steel beams may further<br>
strengthen the structure comprising the first and second frame standardization means<br>
and the wind turbine component. The beams may connect the means through the<br>
wind turbine component or connect by extending on the outside of the component.<br>
Figs. 5a and 5b further illustrate the standardization of the wind turbine nacelle with<br>
the first and second frame standardization means 16,17.<br>
Fig. 5a illustrates schematically the connection between the first frame<br>
standardization means 16 (illustrated with dotted lines) and the nacelle.<br>
The connection is for illustrative purpose shown as an upper and two side beams.<br>
The upper beam 22b directly meets an upper horizontal beam of the machine frame<br>
through the opening 11 of the nacelle. The first side beam 22a meets a vertical beam<br>
and the second beam 22b is connected to the yaw foundation 8 that is connected to<br>
the machine frame.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the beams of the first frame standardization means 16 will<br>
connect the machine frame in the same way e.g. all beams directly to the frame or all<br>
opposite beams to the same structure of the nacelle such as the yaw mechanism or<br>
the machine frame. Further, the number of connections may be different e.g. three,<br>
four or more beams such as an upper/a lower as well as side beams.<br>
The figure further illustrates the connection between a second frame standardization<br>
means 17 (also illustrated with dotted lines) and the rear of the nacelle 3. The means<br>
17 is connected to the machine frame as described above with horizontal beams 17b.<br>
The beams are connected with further beams 17a all together creating the second<br>
frame standardization means 17.<br>
Fig. 5b also schematically illustrates the connection between the first and second<br>
frame standardization means and the nacelle. The nacelle is illustrated as a more or<br>
less four-sided block between the two frame standardization means illustrated as end<br>
walls. The end walls define a four-sided space capable of enclosing the wind turbine<br>
component such as a nacelle, a tubular nacelle or a tower section e.g. a steel or<br>
concrete conical section of a modern wind turbine tower. The wind turbine<br>
component establishes the necessary rigid connection between the two end walls.<br>
The end walls on the other hand establish the outer standardized boundaries allowing<br>
other wind turbine component with the same type of end walls to be positioned<br>
below or on top of the present wind turbine component in which only the walls rest<br>
on each other.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the end walls and the enclosed space corresponds to a<br>
standardized container in size such as a 20 feet, a 40 feet or a standard oversized<br>
shipping container. With the standardized size it is possible to transport and handle<br>
the wind turbine components as any other container in container transportation by<br>
ship, train or truck. As the upper and lower beam in the end walls also correspond to<br>
a standard container, it is possible to use standard lashing equipment such as<br>
twistlocks and lashing bars.<br>
Fig. 5c illustrates a sectional view of the transporting of a standardized wind turbine<br>
nacelle by truck.<br>
With the dotted line connecting the comers of the first and second frame<br>
standardization means 16, 17, it is illustrated that the means as end walls define a<br>
four-sided space capable of enclosing the wind turbine component. The upper and<br>
lower beams (starting points for the dotted lines) of the means are further illustrated<br>
as the standard beams of a shipping container including the openings for the above<br>
mentioned lashing equipment.<br>
The first and second frame standardization means 16, 17 are connected to the first<br>
and second connection vehicle for a wind turbine component 14,15. The connections<br>
are established at the lower ends with hinged connections 27 and at the upper ends<br>
with lift actuators allowing the wind turbine component to be lifted from the ground.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a further preferred embodiment of transportation according to the<br>
invention of a wind turbine nacelle.<br>
The embodiment especially facilitates a mechanical four-point coupling of the<br>
machine frame 6 to the frame attachment arrangement 23. The frame attachment<br>
arrangement 23 is connected to the second connection vehicle 15 with a lower hinged<br>
connection (corresponding to the hinged connections 27 in functionality) and a first<br>
lift actuator. The lift actuator may be connected to the frame attachment arrangement<br>
or directly to the machine frame of the nacelle.<br>
However, the figure also illustrates a first frame standardization means 16<br>
comprising an upper and lower horizontal standardization beam suspended in<br>
between vertical beams defining an end wall. The lower end of the end wall is<br>
connected to the vehicle in a hinged point. The upper end of the end Wall is<br>
connected to a first lift actuator by gripping means including jaws gripping the<br>
underside of the upper standardization beam.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates a perspective view of a first connection vehicle for a wind turbine<br>
component.<br>
The view shows the first trailer lift frame 19 of the first connection vehicle for wind<br>
turbine component 14. The wind turbine component is held by the circular lift<br>
adaptor 24 to engage the hub opening in the nacelle or the one opening of a tower<br>
section. The adaptor is preferably also bolted to the wind turbine component e.g. on<br>
the outer surface of the nacelle or internally to the machine frame.<br>
The adaptor is attached to and lies against a connection plate 30 of the first<br>
standardization means 16. The connection plate ends in a lower standardization beam<br>
30 and is further connected to the lift frame 19 and the vehicle 14 by a hinged<br>
connection 27. The upper standardization beam is not illustrated on the figure but<br>
may be attached to the lower beam with vertical beams or just to the upper part of the<br>
adaptor.<br>
The figure further illustrates the fixed lift frame 26 connected to the connection plate<br>
30 at bottom as well as the second lift actuator 31. The second lift actuator is<br>
positioned substantially parallel with the fixed lift frame 26 and engages with the<br>
inner surface of the adaptor 24 through the gripping means 28. The gripping means is<br>
positioned at the end of the arm of the first lift actuator 25 and grips an inner edge of<br>
the adaptor allowing the distance between the lift frame and the upper part of the<br>
adaptor 24 to be changed while turning around the hinged connection 27.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates another perspective view of the first connection vehicle of fig. 7.<br>
The view especially illustrates (with arrows) the possible moving directions of the<br>
different components of the vehicle 14. As stated above the hinged connection 27<br>
allows the vehicle to turn in relation to the first frame standardization means.<br>
Further, the first lift actuator allows the distance between the adaptor (not illustrated<br>
in the figure) and vehicle to be changed. The vertical second lift actuator 31 is<br>
connected to the lift frame 26 in a fixed connection point. The second lift actuator<br>
ends in a contact face 33 that allows the adaptor to be firmly suspended in relation to<br>
the lift frame 26. The arm of the second lift actuator penetrates up through the jaws<br>
32 of the gripping means 28 before ending in the contact face 33. The jaws 32<br>
comprise two vertical steel plates that each ends in an edge directed upward. The<br>
plates are held in place by another vertical but perpendicular plate in relation to jaw<br>
plates in which the perpendicular plate is attached to both the jaw plates.<br>
The figure also illustrates a connection plate 30 in which the plate may be connected<br>
to the adaptor e.g. in a welded or bolted connection. The lower edge of the plate ends<br>
in a standardization beam 29 defines the lower limit of the first standardization<br>
means 16.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a circular lift adaptor for a wind turbine component. The adaptor 24<br>
comprises an inner ring forming an inner gripping edge 34 that the gripping jaws 32<br>
may engage. The adaptor also comprises an outer ring (illustrated with dotted lines)<br>
expanding from the inner ring and establishing the adaptor in full.<br>
The use of gripping jaws and contact face makes it possible to easily disengage the<br>
wind turbine component with the first and second standardization means 16,17 from<br>
the two vehicles. After the disengagement the wind turbine component with the first<br>
and second standardization means 16, 17 may be moved to another transportation<br>
e.g. from truck to ship transportation.<br>
The figure also illustrates the connection between the lower standardization beam 29,<br>
the connection plate 30 and the front of the adaptor. However, in another<br>
embodiment the connection plate 30 may be replaced with two diagonal beams<br>
connecting the lower standardization beam with the side of the adaptor as well as the<br>
hinged connection 27.<br>
Fig. TO illustrates a sectional view of the connection between the lift frame and the<br>
connection vehicle. The view especially illustrates the hinged connection and the<br>
possibility of disengaging the wind turbine component with the first and second<br>
standardization means 16, 17 from the two vehicles. The disengagement may be<br>
performed by, removing the wedge (also illustrated in figure 8) and lifting the<br>
connection plate out of the holding plate-37 in the hinged connection 27 allowing the<br>
movement around the turning shaft 36. The turning shaft connects the holding plate<br>
of the first or second standardization means and the vehicle represented by the side<br>
plate 35.<br>
Fig. 11 illustrates schematically the functionality of a preferred embodiment of a<br>
transportation system for a wind turbine component e.g. as illustrated in fig. 4 and<br>
10. Figure 11 illustrates the method of lifting the wind turbine component including a<br>
first and second frame standardization means from the ground. The lowering of the<br>
wind turbine component to the ground may be achieved by reversing the method.<br>
The method includes the steps of:<br>
Positioning the first and second trailer in front of the wind turbine component with<br>
the first and second frame standardization means.<br>
Connecting the first and second trailer to the first and second frame standardization<br>
means with gripping jaws engaging the frame standardization means at the top and<br>
bottom. The jaws of the lift actuators are connected at the top of the frame<br>
standardization means. Each of the jaws at the bottom of the standardization means<br>
comprises a pivoting hinge (e.g. hinge 27) establishing the connection to the<br>
associated trailer.<br>
Raising the wind turbine component with the frame standardization means vertically<br>
by extracting the actuators upward.<br>
Allowing the wind turbine component with the frame standardization means to be<br>
raised from the ground by pivoting in the hinges in which the jaws () at the bottom<br>
follow the component and means upwardly.<br>
Fig. 12 illustrates schematically the functionality of another embodiment of the<br>
transportation system. The figure illustrates the method of lifting the wind turbine<br>
component including a first and second frame standardization means from the ground<br>
with the use of a suspension system of two trailers. The lowering of the wind turbine<br>
component to the ground may be achieved by reversing the method.<br>
The method includes the steps of:<br>
Positioning the first and second trailer in front of the wind turbine component with<br>
the first and second frame standardization means.<br>
Adapting the trailers to the lower position of the standardization means by letting<br>
hydraulic oil out of the suspension system or means 38 and thus changing the height<br>
of the trailers above the wheels.<br>
Connecting the trailers to the standardization means with gripping jaws engaging the<br>
standardization means at the top and bottom. The actuators are rigidly connected at<br>
the top and the hinges at the bottom.<br>
Raising the trailers to their normal position by pumping hydraulic oil into the<br>
hydraulic actuators of the suspension system again in which the trailers raise them<br>
self in relation to the wheels.<br>
The wind turbine component with the standardization means will be lifted from the<br>
ground by the raising of the trailers as the actuators and the trailers form a rigid<br>
system. Also the wind turbine component and the standardization means form a rigid<br>
system.<br>
Further, letting air in and out of the tires may be used in order to lower or raise the<br>
trailers or sections hereof e.g. one end if non-solid tires are used. Even further, the<br>
angling between the trailer frames and the actuators may be changed in order to<br>
achieve the lifting of the wind turbine component e.g. by changing the position of<br>
some wheels e.g. by lowering or raising the wheel shafts.<br>
The invention has been exemplified above with reference to specific examples.<br>
However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular<br>
examples described above but may be used in connection with a wide variety of<br>
applications. Further, it should be understood that especially the connection between<br>
the trailers and the wind turbine component according to the invention may be<br>
designed in a multitude of varieties within the scope of the invention as specified in<br>
the claims.<br>
