THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
GRANTED<br>

mechanically through its circular housing frame. The opening of the aperture through which the air enters is adjusted according to the wind velocity and rating of the aerogenerator. The other end of the cylindrical structure is non-adjustable and faces the propeller of the wind mill. The adjustable INLET is connected to the non-adjustable OUTLET by stretchable rubber sheet which makes the periphery of the hollow cylindrical structure. Thus the structure provides an adjustable notch for incoming wind, hence increasing or decreasing its speed as per the law of fluid dynamics.<br>
Now, the invention will be more clearly described with reference to Figs. (1) and (2) of accompanying drawings, wherein Fig. 1 shows the lay out diagram of the Wind Velocity Controller and Fig. 2 shows the Schematic arrangement of the device with the other components of WECS system.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 the hollow cylindrical structure consists of two circular openings (1) and (3). Out of these circular openings (1) is of adjustable aperture type. i.e. the aperture of the opening can be increased or decreased (just like the manually adjusted camera aperture, which is adjusted according to the brightness of light). The adjustable opening for air inlet is a circular metal frame which houses semi-circular metal sheets (2) overlapping each other, can be rotated through the circular frame as it is done for adjusting the aperture in a manual photographic camera, to adjust the inlet aperture, depending on the velocity of incoming wind. The other opening is a circular metal frame (3) of fixed diameter (i.e. non-adjustable) facing the mind turbine propeller(8). The diameter of the circular frame is kept slightly higher than the diameter of the propeller to ensure uninterrupted flow of wind to the turbine blades. These two openings which forms two ends of an adjustable wind flow channel, where cylindrical walls are made of stretchable rubber sheet (4). The rubber sheet (4) can shrink (shown in broken line) or expand (shown in bold line) as the aperture (5) as in Fig.(1) strunk on expand depending on the velocity of natural uncontrolled wind.<br>
Now referring to Fig. (2) which shows the schematic arrangement of the device with the other components of Wind Energy Conversion System or Wind turbine, the device (a hollow cylindrical wind channel) is mounted on a supporting structure (6) which rests on a rail (7) which<br><br><br>
is laid around the turbine tower so that the whole structure along with the device can move along the rail in a circular path around the wind turbine tower (11) and is able to align itself with the direction of wind flow. The turbine blades (8) also rotates and align itself with the direction of wind flow with the help of the tail vane (10). The windmill head (9) supports the rotor, saving the rotor bearings. The tower structure rests on firm ground (12). Depending on the rating of the aerogenerator the device can be directly attached to the main tower (11) itself for more economic operation (laying of rails (7) around the tower (11) is thus omitted).<br>
Working of the invention: The invention works on the principle of fluid dynamics, i.e. the device provides an adjustable flow path for the incoming wind, the when passing through this path the velocity of wind increases when diameter of inlet (1) is greater than diameter of outlet (3), and decreases when diameter of inlet (1) is less than outlet (3) vice versa. The stretchable rubber sheet (4) assumes the shape accordingly as shown in Fig. (2). From the power equation of a Energy Conversion System or Wind turbine we have<br>
Available wind power Pa = 1/8 p n D2 V3 watts, i.e. other parameters remaining constant Pa is directly proportional to Velocity cubed. Hence, slight change in velocity have remarkable effect on the available power. Hence, by regulating the velocity of wind we can regulate the power output. This also adds stability and continuity in the system than with out this regulating device. The wind velocity and direction of with flow is measured by anemometer and wind direction sensor respectively. Reading of the anemometer is used to control the operation of the adjustable aperture as per the rated 'cut-in' and fretting speed of the wind farthing, so that the outlet wind velocity at (3) always remain within the operating range of the turbine (8). The structure can align with the wind by using reading of wind direction sensor, by revolving on rail )7) so that wind outlet (3) always faces turbine blade (s).<br>
Advantages: This system provides more reliable power to the grind. As the wind velocity can now be regulated, the flexibility of the system increases and the system can remain in continuous operation in almost any wind condition. The device also acts as a protective shield for the turbine during high wind or storm. Thus the net result is a stable, safe, reliable and continuous wind energy conversion.<br><br><br>
This Invention relates to an Electro-Mechanical Device, Wind Velocity Controller for controlling and regulating the incoming velocity of wind in a Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) or Wind Mill.<br>
In the known art of conversion of wind energy to Electrical or mechanical energy part of the energy contained in the air by virtue of its motion (i.e. Kinetic Energy) is extracted by means of a sailor or propeller. The incoming stream of wind strikes the blade of propeller and set the propeller in rotation. This rotating motion of the propeller is used to drive an electrical generator or a water pump. But, the existing system remains inoperative when the velocity of wind falls below a certain value (Vc) -cut - in speed during spells of low wind. The system also cannot operate at very high wind speed during gusty spells, and the system has to shut off when the wind speed exceeds or certain value (Vf) - furling speed or cut out speed. Hence the system cannot operate continuously due to this intermittent nature of wind speed making the system unreliable and dependent entirely on the mercy of nature. A substantial part of the available wind power is also wasted as a consequence of lay-off. Thus, the system cannot assure continuous reliable power to the electrical power grid.<br>
It is the object of the invention to devise a device for obviating the above said prior art defects or limitations, and to control and regulate (i.e. to increase or decrease) the incoming wind velocity, so that the system remains in continuous operation in almost any wind condition and is able to apply uninterrupted power to the grind.<br>
It is also the object of the invention to have a device which is simple in construction and easy for operation and also available at Optimum cost.<br>
Thus according to this invention a controller of wind velocity, to control or regulate the incoming velocity of wind in a Wind Energy Convention System, comprises of an adjustable rugged circular cylindrical structure, having two openings at its two ends. One of the openings, which face the incoming wind, is made of individual overlapping metal sheets - which can slide sidewise on one another thus increasing or deceasing the effective inlet diameter.   The individual sheets are operated<br><br><br>
