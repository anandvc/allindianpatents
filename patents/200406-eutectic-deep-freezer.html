This invention pertains to the field of refrigeration engineering and technology. More particularly this invention relates to deep freezer. Precisely this invention relates to Eutectic deep freezer.<br>
The main object of the invention is to design a novel Eutectic deep freezer which is unique in construction. This novel designed freezer will have low power consumption as compared to deep freezers known in the art.<br>
Further one of the design parameter of the deep freezer is such that the factor namely even during continuous power failure frozen foods and ice creams and other material which are kept in the deep freezer will not get melted or damaged is given priority over other design consideration.<br>
It is well known in the art that low voltage tripping and continuous power failures are quite frequent in India. It is evident that during prolonged power tripping/failures the food stuff kept inside the freezer gets spoiled. The deep freezers without Eutectic technology will not be able to hold low temperatures for long time. In this situation only a deep freezer which can hold ice cream solid for 16-24 hours without continuous power supply was thought about considered important.<br>
Eutectic Deep freezer is a freezer in which eutectic solution is used instead of conventional refrigerants. Eutectic solution is a composition of water and Glycol. Eutectic solution can also prepared by adding either Calcium Chloride or Sodium Chloride with water. The percentage of water will vary according to the requirement of temperature to be maintained. When the present invention is applied, the eutectic solution is cooled and converted into solid state without losing it's concentration and to maintain a desired temperature. The compressor's cut off time, when the present invention is applied, is so long. Accordingly the frequency of start-stop of the compressor is drastically reduced.<br>
Now the inventor has developed a Eutectic deep freezer. These Novel Eutectic Deep Freezer will protect food stuff and other articles from spoilage even after 16-24 hrs during continuous power failure. Even after 32-40 hours of continuous power failure, ice cubes will not melt. This Novel Eutectic Deep freezer has the lowest power consumption per day(Under test conditions). Eutectic solution retains low temperature for longest period without power supply.<br>
It is the primary object of the invention to design and develop novel Eutectic deep freezer which is unique.<br>
It is another object of the invention to design and develop a novel Eutectic deep freezer which will retain cooling effect for a longer period of one day during power failure.<br><br>
Further object of the invention will be clear from the following description. Eutectic deep freezer comprises a conventional outer body and an inner tank wherein the invention is characterised in the provision of a middle tank, and the said middle tank being fastened to the inner tank. The middle tank containing an Eutectic solution at the top of the middle tank a capillary tube being provided. On the outside of the inner tank copper tube is soldered. Through this copper tube refrigerant is passed, thereby passing the cooling directly to the inner tank and to the Eutectic solution such that the Eutectic solution retain the effect of cooling for a long time so that the food products are retained in that without being degenerated for a sufficient length of time. The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed is explained in detail in this description. The description of the invention with reference to drawings is accompanying the specification.<br>
According to the inventor, the invention is an eutectic deep freezer comprised of an outer body, an inner tank, and a middle tank fastened with the inner tank and filled with any one of the Eutectic solutions; and at the top of the middle tank a capillary tube being provided; and on the outside of the inner tank copper cooling coil tube is soldered to pass refrigerants directly upon the inner tank and is dipped into the eutectic solution filled in the mrddle tank and the eutectic solution retains the effect of cooling for long time even more than 32-40 hours.<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings shows the construction details of this novel Eutectic Deep Freezer.<br>
Ordinary deep freezers (Non UT Deep Freezer) will have only two chambers/tanks. That is to say one outer body and one inner tank. The Eutectic (UT) deep freezer has three tanks that is to say, an additional middle tank is being fastened to the inner tank . It is either soldered or welded to the inner tank as the case may be. On the top of the middle tank a small hole with a capillary is provided (see Figure 1). The middle tank is filled with eutectic solution. The concentration of the eutectic solution /type of the solution will vary depending upon the requirement of the deep freezer. Eutectic solution will be normally Glycol, Brine.<br>
Eutectic Deep Freezer has an outer body (1) which holds and protects the Polyurethane Foam lnsulation(2). The outer body(1) gives the final appearance to the freezer. The inner tank (3) will hold the food materials and articles. On the outer side of the inner tank the refrigeration pipes are soldered or welded as the case may be. Above this middle tank (4) is welded / soldered to the inner tank. The middle tank is filled with eutectic solution(6). Eutectic solution is a composition obtained by adding water with Glycol, or Brine, or Calcium Chloride, or Sodium Chloride. The concentration of eutectic solution<br><br>
is constantly maintained at -16°.C. The inside temperature of the freezer is normally -22°.C and efficiency of utilization of compressor at -16°.C is better than at -22°C. Accordingly the energy efficiency ratio of the compressor is much better at -16°C than at -22°.C.<br>
Further, in the present invention, the cooling coil(5) at which the evaporation of refrigerant takes place is totally dipped into the eutectic solution(6) and soldered or welded as the case may be with the inner tank(3).<br>
In the present invention, the refrigerant is passed through the cooling coil(5). The flow of refrigerant deciphers the cooling to the inner tank directly as well as transfers the cooling to eutectic solutions. The eutectic solution kept in the middle tank is also cooled. This stored cooling effect of eutectic solution is used to maintain the temperature of the food stuff even after continuous power failure.<br>
The present invention also have a top door (7) provision which is locked with a handle (8). The door is sealed with rubber beading.<br>
This provision of middle tank, and soldering of refrigeration pipe with inner tank, filled with eutectic solution is a novel method in the field of refrigeration technology. The soldering of the refrigeration pipe to the inner tank which is flooded with eutectic solution will increase the efficiency of the heat transfer. Due to this, power consumption is reduced drastically.<br>
Advantages of Invention<br>
During continuous power shutdown/ failures the food articles like milk, ice cream, fish, meat etc are saved from spoilage. The cold storage and ice cream parlor shop owners can sleep without anxiety during night time. The general public need not eat stale food articles any more.<br>
Since the heat transfer area of cooling pipe flooded with eutectic solution is very high and also as the eutectic solution can retain lower temperature and release as and when required, the power consumption of Eutectic deep freezer is lower than non-eutectic deep freezer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
