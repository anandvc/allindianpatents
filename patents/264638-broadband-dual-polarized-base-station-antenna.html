RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 (e) of U.S. provisional patent application Serial No. 60/787.442, filed on March 30, 2006, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application further claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. 119 (e) of U.S. provisional patent application Serial- No. 60/799,241, filed on March 3, 2006, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antennas for receiving and/or transmitting electromagnetic signals. More particularly, the present invention relates to base station antennas for wireless communication systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many wireless applications require transmission and/or reception on orthogonal linear polarizations. In some applications, transmission is performed with one polarization and reception is perfonned with an orthogonal polarization in order to provide isolation between the transmitted and received signals. In other application, electromagnetic energy is received on both polarizations and the signals are combined to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, providing polarization diversity gain.<br>
Since a wireless telecommunication system can suffer from multi-path fading, diversity reception is often used to address severe multi-path fading. A diversity technique requires at least two signal paths that carry the same information but<br><br>
have uncorrelated multi-path fadings. Several types of diversity reception are used in base stations, including space diversity, direction diversity, polarization diversity, frequency diversity and time diversity. Polarization diversity uses orthogonal polarization to provide uncorretated paths. The sense or direction of linear polarization of an antenna is measured from a fixed axis and can vary, depending on system requirements. In particular, the sense of polarization can range from vertical polarization (0 degrees) to horizontal polarization (90 degrees). Conventionally, the most prevalent types of linear polarization used in wireless systems are those which use vertical/horizontal and. +45°/H45° polarization (slant 45°). When an antenna assembly receives or transmits signals with two normally orthogonal polarizations, such an antenna assembly is referred to as dual polarized antenna assembly. Such dual polarized antennas must meet a certain port-to-port isolation specification. There is a need for improved port-to-port isolation in dual polarized antennas.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a dual polarized broadband base station antenna assembly for wireless communication systems. In one embodiment, the antenna assembly employs a dual polarized boxed arrangement radiation element with improved isolation between polarization channels. The box arrangement (box configuration) provides improved port-to-port isolation (isolation between polarization channels), wherein in one embodiment the isolation level is better than 30dB. The radiation element includes plural dipole antennas, wherein each dipole antenna has a paired strips line feed. The microstrip to paired strips line transition is very broad band. The boxed shape arrangement improves the isolation dramatically. Such antenna design may be used for a "cellular" frequency band e.g. 806 - 960 MHz. Alternatively, the same design may operate at e.g. the 380 - 470 MHz band. Another band is e.g. 1710-2170 MHz. However, the antenna design may also be employed in a number of other frequency bands as well, such as WiMax 2.3 GHz. 2.5 GHz. 3.5 GHz. WiFi 2.4GHz, 5.8 GHz frequency bands, etc.<br>
Fig. la shows an example dual polarized boxed arrangement radiation element 1 with mirrored dipoles, for use in a dual polarized antenna with isolation between polarization channels according to the present invention. The radiation element 1 comprises plural dipole antennas (radiating elements) 10 arranged in a general square configuration to provide a boxed arrangement (Fig. la). In a preferred embodiment, the radiation element 1 comprises four dipole antennas 10.<br>
As shown in Figs. 1b-c, each dipole antenna 10 includes two arms (radiating members) 18, 20, a ground plate 12 and two electrical conductors/legs 14 and 16. Fig. lb shows an isometric view of a single dipole antenna 10. The amis 18. 20 can be straight or curved. The conductor 16 is attached to ground using the plate 12, with a dipole arm 18 (Fig. 1d) towards one side, while the other<br><br>
conductor 14 is spaced to the ground by a dielectric, such as air, foam, etc., with a dipole arm 20 (Fig. 1c) towards the opposite side of dipole amn 18, therefore forming a dipole configuration. Each dipole arm forms a radiating section. In this example, the conductor 14 and dipole arm 20 are fomned/stamped from a sheet of conductive material, forming an L-shape. Further, the conductor 16 and dipole arm 18 are formed/stamped from a sheet of conductive material, forming an L-shape. The input conductors 14 and 16 are separated by a gap 22 (e.g.. Fig. 8a). The conductor 14 connects a part of the dipole arm 20 to a feed line 24 and the conductor 16 connects a part of the dipole arm 18.to ground via the plate 12. The conductors 14 and 16 form a paired strips transmission tine having an impedance. The arms 18, 20 also have an impedance. The impedance of the paired strips transmission line 14. 16, is adjusted by varying the width of conductor sections 14, 16 and/or the gap 22 therebetween. The specific dimensions vary with the application. As such, the impedance of the corresponding feed section is adjusted to match the intrinsic input impedance of each dipole. The two conductor sections 14, 16 of the dipole antenna form a balanced paired strips transmission line; therefore, it is unnecessary to provide a balun. This provides the antenna 10 with a very wide impedance bandwidth. Also, the antenna 10 has a stable far-field pattern across the impedance bandwidth.<br>
Fig. Id shows the dipole arm IB that can be attached to a ground plane via the plate 12 and Fig. 1c shows the dipole arm 20 with the microstrip feed line 24 attached. The feed line 24 (and its extension feed line 11A or 11B) comprises a microstrip feed line spaced from the ground plane by non-conductor such as air dielectric (e.g., 31 in Fig. 9). A similar spacing mechanism can be used for spacing the conductor 14 from the ground plane 5. The impedance of the microstrip line is adjusted by varying the width of the line 24, and/or the space between the microstrip line to the ground plane. The feed line 24 is shown as a unitary element of the conductor 14. The conductor section 16 can be connected to the ground plane by any suitable fastening device such as a nut and bolt, a<br><br>
screw, a rivet, or any suitable fastening method including soldering, welding, etc. The suitable connection provides both an electrical and mechanical connection between the conductor 16 and ground plane.<br>
Fig. 2 shows another example wherein plural radiation elements 2 are configured on a ground plane 5, according to the present invention. Each dipole antenna 10 forms a dipole, and has two neighboring (adjacent) orthogonal dipole antennas in the box shape of a radiation element 2, and one parallel (across) dipole antenna in said-box shape. The box dipole formed by each dipole antenna. 10.couples strongly with its neighboring orthogonal dipoles 10. However, if two parallel dipoles are fed with equal phase and amplitude and are arranged symmetrically with respect to the orthogonal dipoie(s), then the coupled energy from one neighboring dipole will be of equal magnitude and opposite phase as energy from the other neighboring dipole. Then the two coupled fields therefore cancel out. The isolation between two polarization channels will be improved dramatically because of the boxed dipole arrangement. The antennas 10 are paired with a common feed pattern (e.g., 11A or 11B) providing a common input.<br>
Rg. 5 shows a pair of dipole antennas ID forming a +45° polarization radiating dipole antenna pair (dipole pair A) with a common feed line 11 A. Fig. 6 shows another pair of dipole antennas 10 forming a -45° polarization radiating dipole antenna pair (dipole pair B) with a common feed line 11B. The dipole pairs A and B are arranged to obtain the square configuration ±45° polarization radiation element 1 in Fig. la. Plural radiation elements 1 can be arranged in an array.<br>
Fig. 3 shows an array 13A of four dipole pairs 17A having a common feed line 11 A. Each dipole pair 17A comprises a pair of antennas 10. Fig. 4 shows another array 13B of four dipole pairs 17B, having a common feed line 11B. The arrays 13A and 138 are arranged to obtain the configuration of four radiation elements 1 shown in Fig. 2. The ground plane 5 has a length and a vertical axial<br><br>
along the length, and the dipole radiating antennas 10 project outwardly (transversely) from a surface of the ground plane 5.<br>
Fig. 7a shows how a non-conducting clip 15 (e.g., plastic dip) may be employed to hold a pair of adjacent (orthogonal) dipole antennas 10 together, to form an essentially square configuration for four dipole antennas 10. As shown in Fig. 7b, each clip 15 Is L-shaped with ends 15A, 15B, which as Fig. 7c shows by example in more detail, snap into holes in the arms 20, 18. respectively of two orthogonal dipole antennas iO^to hold the orthogonal-antennas together. As those sicilled in the art will recognize, other ways of hold the orthogonal antennas together are possible. As such, the present invention is not limited to the examples shown in Figs. 7a-c.<br>
