COMPOSITION CONTAINING SAME AND ARTICLES MANUFACTURED THEREFROM<br>
APPLICANT(S)<br>
a)	Name        : MOMENTIVE PERFORMANCE MATERIALS INC.<br>
b)	Nationality : AMERICAN Company<br>
c)	Address     : 22 CORPORATE WOODS BOULEVARD, 4TH FLOOR,<br>
ALBANY, NEW YORK 12211, U.S.A.<br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to halo-functional silanes, their preparation, rubber compositions containing same and articles such as tires manufactured therefrom.<br>
The use of the silica/silane- filler system to reduce the rolling resistance and improve the wet traction of passenger car tires is well known in the art. A reduction of rolling resistance, and therefore less fuel consumption, is also of strong interest for truck tires. However, the use of silica to replace carbon black filler in natural rubber (NR) containing formulations such as truck tread compounds is limited due to poor abrasion resistance. At the present time, truck tire treads use highly reinforcing carbon black for maximum reinforcement and excellent resistance to abrasion. The replacement of carbon black by silica in truck applications has been hampered by ineffective coupling of the silica to the polymer chains of natural rubber.<br>
Polysulfurized alkoxysilanes such as bis(triethoxysilylpropyl)tetrasulfide (TESPT) and blocked mercapto-functional silanes such as 3-octanoylthio-l-propyltriethoxysilane are currently regarded as the most effective and the most widely used coupling agents in rubber compositions for tires, especially those compositions containing styrene-butadiene rubber or butadiene rubber. The reinforcing efficiency and abrasion resistance of vulcanizates filled with silica are not good enough to justify the replacement of carbon black in formulations containing high levels of natural rubber.<br>
The use of non-sulfur silanes is focused on the use of activated double bonds to improve the coupling between fillers and polymer, notably natural rubber. But these non-sulfur coupling agents have shown inadequate coupling performance or performance inferior to that offered by polysulfurized silanes such as bis(triethoxysiIylpropyl)tetrasulfide. In addition, the known non-sulfur silanes are very reactive with conventional fillers and elastomers and are therefore difficult to use. When known non-sulfur silanes are used at levels necessary to achieve<br><br>
optimum coupling of filler to the host elastomer, the uncured filled elastomer typically exhibits poorly dispersed filler and short scorch times during curing. Both good filler dispersion and good filler reinforcing efficiency are required to achieve satisfactory end-use properties.<br>
Commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent application Serial No.11/703,969, filed February 8, 2007, addresses the inadequate coupling performance of non-sulfur silanes by using halo-functional silane. This halo-functional silane is derived from mono-alcohols that generate volatile organic compound (VOC's) emissions during their use in filled elastomers. The mono-alcohols that are formed during use of the halo- functional silane have low flash points and therefore create potential hazards during fabrication and use. In addition, the mono-alcohol derived halo-functional silanes generate mono-alcohols during use that may impact adversely on the environment.<br>
Glycol derivatives of organosilanes are known in the art. Commonly assigned, copending U. S. patent application Serial Nos. 11/358,550, filed February 21, 2006, 11/358,818, filed February 21, 2006, 11/358,369, filed February 21 , 2006, and 11/358,861, filed February 21,2006, address the scorch, VOC emissions and coupling performance of filled elastomers by using organo functional silanes or mixtures of organofunctional silanes that contain both blocked and free mercaptan groups. Commonly assigned, copending U. S. patent applications Serial Nos. 11/505,055, filed August 14,2006,11/505,166, filed August 14, 2006, and 11/505,178 filed August 14, 2006, address the scorch, VOC emissions and coupling performance of filled elastomers using organofunctional silanes or mixtures of organofunctional silanes that contain both dispersing and free mercaptan groups. In addition, commonly assigned, copending U.S. patent application Serial No. 11/104,103, filed April 12, 2005, addresses the VOC emissions of organo functional silanes containing alkanedioxysilyl groups. The entire contents of aforementioned U.S. patent application Serial Nos. 11/358,550; 11/358,818; 11/358,681; 11/505,055; 11/505,166; 11/505,178; and 11/104,103 are incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
It would be desirable for various rubber applications to have a rubber composition that utilizes increased levels of silica and lower levels of carbon black while maintaining low VOC emissions from the filled elastomeric materials and elastomeric articles during their preparation and use and still exhibiting the properties of low scorch, good filler dispersion and improved abrasion resistance.<br>

In one specific embodiment, the rubber composition herein comprises the mixture and/or reaction product of components (a), (b), (c) and, optionally, (d).<br>
In a further embodiment of the rubber composition herein, halo-functional silane (c) bonds to silane-reactive filler (b) through one functionality and to rubber component (a), e.g., a diene polymer, through a different functionality.<br>
In one embodiment, at least one activating agent (d) can be used in the rubber compounding process to facilitate the coupling reactions between rubber component (a) and halo-functional silane (c). The activating agent can be selected from among the transition metal salts. Useful transition metal salts include metal oxides, metal halides, metal carboxylates, metal hydroxides and other suitable metal complexes. Some representative non-limiting examples of useful transition metal salts include metal oxides such as zinc oxide, aluminum oxide and titanium oxide; metal halides such as zinc chloride, zinc bromide, zinc iodide, aluminum chloride, aluminum bromide, titanium chloride, titanium bromide and stannic chloride; and, metal carboxylates such as zinc stearate, zinc acetate and stannic octanoate.<br>
Rubber component (a) can be one ore more diene-based elastomers and/or rubbers and can be selected from any of those that are well known in the art many of which are described in "The Vanderbilt Rubber Handbook", RF. Ohm, ed.; R.T. Vanderbilt Company, Inc., Norwalk, CT, 1990 and "Manual For The Rubber Industry", T. Kempermann, S. Koch, J. Sumner, eds.; Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany, 1993.<br>
Representative non-limiting examples of rubber component (a) (organic polymers) include natural rubber (NR), synthetic polyisoprene (IR), polybutadiene (BR), various copolymers of butadiene, the various copolymers of isoprene and mixtures of these elastomers; solution styrene-butadiene rubber (SSBR), emulsion styrene-butadiene rubber (ESBR), ethylene-propylene terpolymers (EPDM) and acrylonitrile-butadiene rubber (NBR). Rubber component (a) is preferably natural rubber and/or synthetic polyisoprene.<br><br>
Suitable monomers for preparing rubber component (a) include conjugated dienes such as isoprene and 1,3-butadiene, and vinyl aromatic compounds such as styrene and alpha methyl styrene, and combinations thereof. In a particular embodiment, rubber component (a) is a sulfur-curable rubber.<br>
Rubber component (a) can be selected from the non-limiting examples of at least one of cis-l,4-polyisoprene rubber (natural and/ or synthetic), and preferably natural rubber, emulsion polymerization-prepared styrene/butadiene copolymer rubber, organic solution polymerization-prepared styrene/butadiene rubber, 3,4-poly isoprene rubber, isoprene/butadiene rubber, styrene/isoprene/butadiene terpolymer rubber, cis-1,4- poly butadiene, medium vinyl poly butadiene rubber (about 35-50 percent vinyl), high vinyl polybutadiene rubber (about 50-75 percent vinyl), styrene/isoprene copolymers, emulsion polymerization-prepared styrene/butadiene/aerylonitrile terpolymer rubber and butadiene/aerylonitrile copolymer rubber. An emulsion polymerization-derived styrene/butadiene (ESBR) is also contemplated as diene-based rubber for use herein such as one having a relatively low to medium styrene content (e.g., from 20 to 29 percent bound styrene) or for some applications, an ESBR having a medium to relatively high bound styrene content (e.g., from 30 to 45 percent bound styrene). In another embodiment, rubber component (a) can be an emulsion polymerization-prepared styrene/butadiene/aerylonitrile terpolymer rubber (e.g., containing from 2 to 40 weight percent bound aerylonitrile).<br>
Suitable solution polymerization-prepared SBR (SSBR) rubbers can contain from 5 to 50, preferably from 9 to 36, and more preferably from 20 to 30, weight percent bound styrene.<br>
In another embodiment, useful polybutadiene elastomers possess a cis-1,4- content of at least 90 weight percent.<br><br>
In yet another embodiment of the rubber composition of the invention, rubber component (a) is a dlene polymer functionalized or modified by an alkoxysilane derivative. Accordingly, silane-functionalized organic solution polymerization-prepared styrene-butadiene rubber and silane-functionalized organic solution polymerization- prepared 1 ,4-polybutadiene rubbers can be used. These rubber compositions are known, e.g., from U.S. Patent No. 5,821,290, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In still another embodiment of the rubber composition of the invention, rubber component (a) is a diene polymer functionalized or modified by a tin derivative. Tin-coupled copolymers of styrene and butadiene can be prepared, for example, by introducing a tin coupling agent during the styrene and 1,3 -butadiene monomer copolymerization reaction in an organic solvent solution, usually at or near the end of the reaction. Such tin-coupled styrene-butadiene rubbers are well known in the art, e.g., from U.S. Patent No. 5,268,439, the entire contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. In practice, at least 50 percent, and preferably from 60 to 85 percent, of the tin is bonded to the butadiene units of the styrene-butadiene rubbers to create a tin-dienyl bond.<br>
Silane-reactive filler (b) is a substance that is capable of reaction with silane (c) to form stable Si-O-hller bonds. Silane-reactive filler (b) includes a substance that is added to rubber component (a) to reinforce the cured rubber composition. Reinforcing fillers are materials whose moduli are higher than rubber component (a) of the rubber composition and are capable of absorbing stress from rubber component (a) when this component is strained. Suitable silane-reactive fillers (b) includes fibers, particulates and sheet-like structures and can be made up of inorganic minerals, silicates, silica, clays, ceramics, carbon, organic polymers and diatomaceous earth, and the like. In one embodiment, silane-reactive filler (b) can be a discrete particle or group of particles in the form of aggregates and/or agglomerates. Silane-reactive filler (b) can be mixed with other fillers that do not<br><br>
react with silane (c). These fillers can be used to either extend rubber component (a) or to reinforce the elastomeric network.<br>
Some representative non-limiting examples of suitable silane-reactive fillers (b) include metal oxides such as silica (pyrogenic and/or precipitated), titanium dioxide, aluminosilicate, alumina and siliceous materials such as clays and talc. In one embodiment, particulate precipitated silica is used in connection with a silane. Preferably, silane-reactive filler (b) is a silica used alone or in combination with one or more other fillers. In one embodiment, a combination of silica and carbon black is utilized for a variety of rubber products, e.g., treads for tires. Alumina can be used either alone or in combination with silica. The term "alumina" herein refers to aluminum oxide, or AI2O3. In a further specific embodiment, the fillers can be hydrated or anhydrous. Use of alumina in rubber compositions is known, e.g., from U.S. Patent No. 5,116,886 and EP 631 982, the entire contents of both of which are incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The term "carrier" as used below shall be understood herein to mean a porous or high surface area filler or organic polymer that has a high adsorption or absorption capability and is capable of carrying up to 75 percent liquid silane while maintaining its free-flowing and dry properties. The carrier filler or carrier polymer herein is essentially inert to the silane and is capable of releasing or deabsorbing the liquid silane when added to the elastomeric composition.<br>
Silane-reactive filler (b) herein can be used as a carrier for liquid silanes and reinforcing fillers for elastomers in which halo-functional silane (c) is capable of reacting or bonding with the surface. The fillers that are used as carriers are non-reactive with silane (c). The non-reactive nature of the fillers is demonstrated by the ability of halo- functional silane (c) to be extracted at greater than 50 percent of the loaded silane using an organic solvent. The extraction procedure is described in U. S. Patent No. 6,005,027, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
Representative non-limiting examples of carries include porous organic polymers, carbon black, diatomaceous earth and silicas that are characterized by a relatively low differential of less than 1.3 between the infrared absorbance at 3502 cm-2 of the silica when taken at 105°C and when taken at 500°C as described in aforementioned U. S. Patent No. 6,005,027. In one embodiment, the amount of halo- functional silane (c) that can be loaded on the carrier can range from 0.1 to 70 weight percent. In another embodiment, halo-functional silane (c) is loaded onto the carrier at concentrations between about 10 and about 50 weight percent.<br>
Silane-reactive filler (b) includes fillers in which halo-functional silane (c) is reactive with the surface of die filler. Particulate precipitated silica is useful as silane- reactive filler (b), especially when the silica possesses reactive surface silanols. Silane-reactive filler (b) can be provided in hydrated form.<br>
Other fillers that can be mixed with silane-reactive filler (b) include those that are essentially inert to halo-functional silane (c) with which they are admixed as is the case with carbon black and organic polymer fillers.<br>
At least two different silane-reactive fillers can be mixed together and thereafter reacted with silane(s) (c). Thus, one or more carriers possessing metal hydroxyl surface functionality such as the silicas and other siliceous particulates which possess surface silanol functionality can be mixed with one or more reinforcing fillers containing metal hydroxyl surface functionality, e.g., alumina, aluminosilicates, clay, talc, magnesium hydroxide and iron oxide,and thereafter reacted with the selected silane(s){c).<br>
Precipitated silica is advantageously used as silane-reactive filler (b). Precipitated silica may be characterized as one having a Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area, as measured using nitrogen gas, in a range of from 40 to 600, preferably from 50 to 300, and more preferably from 100 to 150, m2/g. The BET method of<br><br>
measuring surface area is described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume 60, page 304 (1930) and is the method used herein.<br>
Precipitated silica can also be characterized as one having a dibutylphthalate (DBP) absorption value in a range of from 100 to 350, preferably from 150 to 300, and more preferably from 200 to 250. Silane-reactive fillers (b), as well as the aforesaid alumina and aluminosilicate fillers, typically have a CTAB surface area in a range of from 100 to 220 m2/g. The CTAB surface area is the external surface area as determined by cetyl trimethylammonium bromide with a pH of 9. The method for the measurement of CTAB surface area is described in ASTM D 3849.<br>
The surface area of silane-reactive filler (b) can also be expressed in terms of its mercury porosity surface area as determined by mercury porosimetry. In this technique, mercury is allowed to penetrate the pores of a sample of filler after a thermal treatment to remove volatiles. More specifically, the set-up conditions use a 100 mg sample of filler, remove volatiles therefrom over 2 hours at 105CC and ambient atmospheric pressure and employ a measurement range of from ambient to 2000 bars pressure. Such measurement can be performed according to the method described in Winslow, et al. in ASTM bulletin, p.39 (1959) or according to DIN 66133. Por such measurement, a CARLO-ERBA Porosimeter 2000 may be used. The average mercury porosity specific surface area for the selected silane-reactive filler (b), e.g., silica, will ordinarily be in a range of from 100 to 300, preferably from 150 to 275, and more preferably from 200 to 250, m2/g-<br>
A suitable pore size distribution for silane-reactive filler (b), e.g., the non- limiting examples of silica, alumina and aluminosilicate,) according to the aforedescribed mercury porisimetry can be as follows: five percent or less of its pores have a diameter of less than 10 nm; from 60 to 90 percent of its pores have a diameter of from 10 to 100 run; from 10 to 30 percent of its pores have a diameter of from 100 to 1,000 nm; and from 5 to 20 percent of its pores have a diameter of greater than 1,000 nm. Silane-reactive filler (b), e.g., silica, can be expected to have an average ultimate<br><br>
particle size, e.g., in the range of from 0.01 to 0.05 um as determined by electron microscopy, although the particles can be even smaller, or possibly larger, in size. Various commercially available silicas can used herein such as those available from PPG Industries under the HI-SIL trademark, in particular, HI-SIL 210 and 243; silicas available from Rhone-Poulenc, e.g., ZEOSIL 1165MP; silicas available from Degussa, e.g., VN2 and VN3, etc., and silicas available from Huber, e.g., HUBERSIL 8745.<br>
Where it is desired for a rubber composition containing both a siliceous filler such as silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicate and a carbon black reinforcing pigment, to be primarily reinforced by the siliceous filler, the weight ratio of siliceous filler to carbon black can be up to 30/1 and, advantageously, is within the range of from 3/1 to 10/1.<br>
Silane-reactive filler (b) can comprise from 15 to 95 weight percent precipitated silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicate and, correspondingly, from 5 to 85 weight percent carbon black having a CTAB value in a range of from 80 to 150. Alternatively, silane-reactive filler (b) can comprise from 60 to 95 weight percent of said silica, alumina and/or aluminosilicate and, correspondingly, from 40 to 5 weight percent of carbon black. The siliceous filler and carbon black, when used together, can be pre- blended or blended together in the manufacture of the vulcanized rubber.<br>
In still another embodiment, there is provided herein a process for preparing a rubber composition comprising mixing components (a), (b), (c) and optionally, (d), in effective amounts. An effective amount of halo-functional silane (c) can range from 0.2 to 20, preferably from 0.5 to 15, and more preferably from 2 to 10, weight percent based on the total weight of the rubber composition. An effective amount of silane-reactive filler (b) can range from 2 to 70, preferably from 5 to 50, and more preferably from 20 to 40, weight percent based on the total weight of the rubber composition. An effective amount of rubber component (a) can range from 30 to 90, preferably from 50 to 95, and more preferably from 60 to 80, weight percent based on the total weight of the rubber composition. The process for preparing the rubber composition<br><br>
can further comprise curing the composition, before, during and/or after its molding. A vulcanized rubber composition should contain a sufficient amount of silane-reactive filler (b) to achieve a reasonably high modulus and high resistance to tear. Specifically, an effective amount of silane-reactive filler (b) can be as low as 5 to 100 parts per hundred parts of rubber (phr) component (a), and preferably from 25 to 85, and more preferably from 50 to 70, phr.<br>
Halo-functional silane (c) can be premixed, or pre-reacted, with particles, aggregates and/or agglomerates of silane-reactive filler (b) or it can be added to the rubber mix during the processing or mixing of rubber (a) and silane-reactive filler (b). If halo-functional silane (c) and silane-reactive filler (b) are added separately to the process mixture during the mixing of rubber component (a) and silane-reactive filler (b), silane (c) can be considered to have coupled in situ to silane-reactive filler (b).<br>
In practice, sulfur-vulcanized rubber products typically are prepared by thermomechanically mixing rubber and various ingredients in a sequentially step¬wise manner followed by shaping and curing the compounded rubber to form a vulcanized product. More specifically, first, for the aforesaid mixing of rubber component(s)(a) and various ingredients, typically exclusive of sulfur and sulfur vulcanization accelerators (collectively "curing agents"), the rubber(s) and various rubber compounding ingredients are usually blended in at least one, and optionally two or more, preparatory thermomechanical mixing stage(s) in suitable mixers. Such preparatory mixing is referred to as non-productive mixing or as non-productive mixing steps or stages. Such preparatory mixing is typically conducted at temperatures in the range of from 130°C to 180°C and preferably from 140°C to 160°C.<br>
Subsequent to the preparatory mixing stage, in a final mixing stage, which may also be referred to as a productive mixing stage, curing agents, and, optionally, one or more additional ingredients, are mixed with the rubber compound or composition, typically at a temperature in the range of from 50°C to 130CC, which is a lower<br><br>
temperature than that utilized in the preparatory mixing stage/ in order to prevent or retard premature curing (i.e., "scorching") of the sulfur-curable rubber.<br>
The rubber composition typically is allowed to cool, sometimes after or during a process of intermediate mill mixing, between the aforesaid mixing steps, e.g., to a temperature of 50°C or lower.<br>
When it is desired to mold and cure the rubber composition, the rubber composition is placed in the desired mold and heated to at least 130°C and up to 200°C to bring about the vulcanization of the rubber.<br>
By thermomechanical mixing is meant that the rubber compound, or composition of rubber and rubber compounding ingredients, is mixed in a rubber mixer under high shear conditions where by it autogenously heats up, primarily due to shear and associated friction.<br>
Several chemical reactions can occur at various steps in the mixing and curing processes. For example, the independent addition of a sulfur source can be manipulated by the amount of addition thereof and by sequence of addition relative to the addition of other ingredients to the rubber mixture.<br>
The rubber composition of the invention is advantageously prepared by the process which comprises:<br>
A)	thermomechanically mixing in at least one preparatory mixing operation:<br>
(a)	at least one rubber component (a);<br>
(b)	at least one silane-reactive filler (b);<br>
(c)	at least one halo-functional silane (c); and,<br>
(d)	optionally, at least one activating agent (d);<br>
B)	blending the mixture resulting from step (A) in a final thermomechanical mixing<br>
step, optionally, with at least one curing agent, to provide a substantially uniform<br>
mixture; and,<br><br>
C) optionally curing the mixture resulting from step (B) to provide a cured rubber composition.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the foregoing two-stage process: preparatory mixing step (A) is carried out at a temperature of from 140°C to 180°C for from 1 to 20 minutes, and preferably at a temperature of from 150°C to 170°C for from 4 to 15 minutes, with 100 parts by weight of sulfur- vulcanizable rubber component (a) selected from the group consisting of conjugated diene homopolymers and copolymers of at least one conjugated diene and aromatic vinyl compound, from 5 to 100, and preferably from 25 to 80, parts by weight of silane-reactive filler (b) containing from 0 to 85 weight percent carbon black, from 0.05 to 20, and preferably, from 2 to 10, parts by weight of halo-functional silane (c) and, optionally, from 0.01 to 15, and preferably from 1 to 5, parts by weight of activating agent (d); final mixing step (B) is carried out with from 0 to 5 parts by weight of at least one curing agent at a temperature of from 50°C to 130°C for from 1 to 30, and preferably from 1 to 5, minutes; and, optional curing step (C) is carried out at a temperature of from 130°C to 200°C for a period of from 5 to 600, and preferably 10 to 60 minutes.<br>
The rubber composition herein can be compounded by methods known in the rubber compounding art such as mixing component (a) (the various sulfur-vulcanizable constituent rubbers) with various commonly used additive materials such as, for example, curing aids such as sulfur, activators, retarders and accelerators, processing additives such as oils, resins, e.g., tackifying resins, silicas, plasticizers, fillers, pigments, fatty acid, zinc oxide, waxes, antioxidants and antiozonants, peptizing agents, and reinforcing materials such as, e.g., carbon black, and the like. Depending on the intended use of the rubber composition (sulfur-vulcanizable) and cured rubber composition (sulfur-vulcanized material), the aforementioned additives may be selected and used in known and conventional amounts.<br><br>
Vulcanization can be conducted in the presence of an additional sulfur vulcanizing agent. In one embodiment, some illustrative non-limiting examples of suitable sulfur vulcanizing agents include, e.g., elemental sulfur (free sulfur) or sulfur- donating vulcanizing agents such as amino disulfide, polymeric poly sulfure or sulfur- olefin adducts which are conventionally added in the final, i.e., productive, rubber composition mixing step. In another specific embodiment, the sulfur vulcanizing agents (which are common in the art) are used, or added, in the productive mixing stage, in an amount ranging from up to about 8 phr, with a range preferably of from 0.4 to 5 phr, and more preferably of from about 1.5 to about 4.0 phr, and in some cases from about 2 to about 2.5 phr, being generally suitable.<br>

Accelerators can be added to control the time and/or temperature required for vulcanization and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. A single accelerator<br><br>
system can be used, i.e., a primary accelerator. Conventionally primary accelerator(s) can be used in amounts ranging from 0.5 to 4, and preferably from 0.8 to 1.5 phr. Combinations of a primary and a secondary accelerator can be used with the secondary accelerator being used in smaller amounts, e.g., from 0.05 to 3 phr, in order to activate and to improve the properties of the vulcanizate. Delayed action accelerators and/or vulcanization retarders can also be used.<br>
Suitable types of accelerators include amines, disulfides, guanidines, thioureas, thiazoles, thiurams, sulfenamides, dithiocarbamates, xanthates and combinations thereof. The primary accelerator can be a sulfanamide. If a second accelerator is used, it can be a guanidine, dithiocarbamate or thiuram compound.<br>

The rubber compositions of Comp. Ex. 4 and Exs. 4 and 5 have the same formulations except for the silane component.<br><br>
Table 1. Formulations of the Rubber Compositions<br><br>
The notation in Table 1 above is defined as fotiows: NR: Natural rubber (SMR-L); silica: Zeosil 1165MP from Rhodia; CB: carbon black (N-220); process oil: Sundex 8125 from Sun Oil; ZnO: Kadox 720C from ZincCorp.; stearic acid: Industrene R from Witco, Crompton; 6 PPD:(Flexzone 7P from Uniroyal); Wax: Sunproof Improved from Uniroyal, Crompton; Nauguard Q: from Uniroyal; Sulfur: Rubbermakers Sulfur 104 from Harwick; TBBS: Delac S from Uniroyal, Crompton; DPG: from Uniroyal, Crompton.<br>
The mixing of the rubber masterbatch was done in a two-pass procedure as hereinafter described using a Krupp mixer with a 1550 cubic centimenter (cc) chamber volume. In the first pass, the mixer was turned on with the mixer at 30 rpm<br><br>
and the cooling water on full. The rubber polymers were added to the mixer and ram down mixed for 60 seconds. Half of the silica and all of the silane with approximately 35-40 grams of this portion of silica in an ethylvinyl acetate (EVA) bag were added and ran down mixed for 60 seconds. The remaining silica and the processing oil in an EVA bag were next added and ram down mixed for 60 seconds. The mixer throat was dusted down, and the mixer's mixing speed was increased to 90 rpm as required to raise the temperature of the rubber masterbatch to 140°C. The master batch was dumped (removed from the mixer), a sheet was formed on a roll mill set at about 60° to 65°C and the sheet allowed to cool to ambient temperature.<br>
In the second pass, the sheets from the first pass were added to the mixer and ram down mixed for 60 seconds. The rest of the ingredients except for the curatives were added together and ram down mixed for 60 seconds. The mixer throat was dusted down and the mixer's mixing speed was increased to 90 rpm as required to raise the temperature of the rubber master batch to between 135°C to 140°C. The rubber master batch was mixed for five minutes and the speed of the Krupp mixer as adjusted to maintain the temperature between 135CC and 140°C.<br>
The rubber masterbatch and the curatives were mixed on a roll mill heated to between 60°C and 65°C. The sulfur and accelerators were added to the rubber masterbatch and thoroughly mixed on the roll mill and allowed to form a sheet. The sheet was cooled to ambient before curing.<br>
The measurements and tests used to characterize the rubber compositions are described below. The rubber compositions are characterized before and after curing, as indicated below.<br>
The theological properties of the compositions were measured on a Monsanto R-100 Oscillating Disk Rheometer and a Monsanto M 1400 Mooney Viscometer. The specimens for measuring the mechanical properties were cut from 6 mm plaques cured for ( t90 +1) minutes at 149°C. Curing and testing of the cured rubber compositions in the form of plaques were carried out according to ASTM standards.<br><br>
In addition, small strain dynamic tests were carried out on a Rheometrics Dynamic Analyzer (ARES - Rheometrics Inc.). Payne effect strain sweeps were carried out from dynamic strain amplitudes of 0.01 % to about 25% shear strain amplitude at 10 Hz and 60°C. The dynamic parameters, G'initial, AG', G"max and tan omax, were extracted from the non-linear responses of the rubber compounds at small strains. In some cases, steady state values of tan 6 were measured after 15 minutes of dynamic oscillations at strain amplitudes of 35% (at 60°C). Temperature dependence of dynamic properties was also measured from about -80°C to +80°C at small strain amplitudes (1 or 2%) at a frequency of 10 Hz.<br>

The advantage for reinforcement power obtained with silane (c) in accordance with the invention herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
Examination of the data presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4 leads to the following observations: the Mooney viscosity values are all low, indicating the good ability of the compositions to be processed in the uncured state and scorching rimes are long enough to provide a good safety margin.<br>
Compared with the compositions of Comp. Exs. 3 and 4 (the control compositions for carbon black and Silquest A-1289 silane, respectively), those of Ex. 5 have significantly better overall characteristics. In particular, the modulus value under higher deformation (M300) and the (M300/M100) ratio are both appreciably higher for Ex. 5 than for Comp. Exs. 3 and 4 indicating better reinforcement for the former compared with the latter.<br>
The rubber composition of this invention is particularly advantageous for use in the manufacture of tire treads exhibiting low rolling resistance and high wear resistance, especially when the treads are based on natural rubber or synthetic polyisoprene.<br><br>
