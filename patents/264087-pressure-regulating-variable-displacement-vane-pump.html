PRESSURE REGULATING VARIABLE DISPLACEMENT VANE PUMP<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to engine lubrication systems and, more<br>
particularly, to variable displacement pumps for supplying engine oil to<br>
internal combustion engines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	It is known in the art relating to internal combustion engines<br>
that modern vehicle engine designs utilize engine oil pressure to enable<br>
various forms of variable engine valve actuation devices, including cam<br>
phasers and cylinder deactivation devices. Such variable valve actuation<br>
devices have strict pressure requirements. For example, cam phasers require a<br>
certain minimum pressure for proper function, while an excess pressure<br>
condition can cause cylinder deactivation system malfunction. Due to the<br>
strict pressure requirements of these devices, use of these devices has created a<br>
very narrow operational pressure window for the lubrication system of the<br>
engine.<br>
[0003]	Previously, in U.S. Patent No. 6,763,797, we disclosed a<br>
variable displacement pump in which pump outlet pressure is used to bias the<br>
position of a cam ring (slide), thereby changing the eccentricity of the pump<br>
and consequently varying the pump displacement. By varying the pump<br>
displacement relative to pump outlet pressure, the pump outlet pressure can be<br>
controlled based on engine flow requirements. The pressure regulation<br>
characteristics of the pump are determined by calibrating a reaction spring that<br>
counterbalances the hydraulic forces acting on the cam ring. Further<br>
optimization of the pressure regulation characteristics of variable displacement<br>
pumps used in engine lubrication systems is desirable.<br><br>
2<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	The present invention provides a variable displacement vane<br>
pump that utilizes a pressure source from the engine (for example, the outlet<br>
pressure of the pump or a feedback pressure from the engine) to regulate the<br>
displacement of the pump. The variable displacement vane pump may be used<br>
with an internal combustion engine and includes a control chamber, a dump<br>
chamber, and a vent chamber that are co-operable to vary the displacement of<br>
the pump depending upon the operating conditions of the engine. Such<br>
operating conditions include normal engine operation, high engine speed<br>
operation, and cold engine operation. By selectively varying its displacement,<br>
the pump ensures that the oil pressure in the engine lubrication system is<br>
maintained within the narrow range of operating pressures necessary for<br>
proper functioning of the engine components.<br>
[0005]	In an exemplary embodiment, a variable displacement vane oil<br>
pump in accordance with the invention includes pumping chambers defined by<br>
slide vanes carried by a rotor rotatable in a housing for pumping engine oil<br>
from an inlet to a pressurized outlet. The vane pump also has	a<br>
displacement control for controlling displacement of the pumping chambers.<br>
The displacement control includes a cam ring in the housing pivotally<br>
connected to a wall of the housing by a pivot. The cam ring is internally<br>
engaged by the vanes. A control chamber is generally defined by the cam ring<br>
and the housing wall. A control orifice provides for communication of control<br>
oil from the pressurized outlet to the control chamber. Control oil in the<br>
control chamber exerts a force on the cam ring. A resilient member biases the<br>
cam ring in a direction opposite to a direction of the force exerted by the<br>
control oil in the control chamber.<br><br>
3<br>
[0006]	A vent chamber is disposed generally opposite the control<br>
chamber and is defined by the cam ring and the housing wall. The vent<br>
chamber is at approximately atmospheric pressure. A dump chamber is<br>
defined by the cam ring and the housing wall and is generally disposed<br>
between the control chamber and the vent chamber. A dump orifice provides<br>
for communication of fluid between the control chamber and the dump<br>
chamber. Control oil in the dump chamber is capable of exerting a force on<br>
the cam ring that, in combination with the force of control oil in the control<br>
chamber, opposes the biasing force of the resilient member. A vent orifice<br>
provides for communication of fluid between the vent chamber and the dump<br>
chamber in order to vent the dump chamber.<br>
[0007]	The cam ring is pivotable in the housing to positions at which<br>
the dump orifice and vent orifice are open or closed. In one position of the<br>
cam ring, the dump orifice and vent orifice are open. In another position of<br>
the cam ring, the dump orifice is open while the vent orifice is closed. In yet<br>
another position of the cam ring, the dump orifice is closed while the vent<br>
orifice is open. Further, the pivotal motion of the cam ring may vary the size<br>
of the control orifice, dump orifice, vent orifice, or any combination of the<br>
three orifices, and therefore the amount of flow of control oil through the flow<br>
orifices from the pressurized outlet to the control chamber.<br>
[0008]	These and other features and advantages of the invention will<br>
be more fully understood from the following description of certain specific<br>
embodiments of the invention taken together with the accompanying<br>

and 5.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
[0017]	Referring now to the drawings in detail, numeral 10 generally<br>
indicates a variable displacement vane pump in accordance with the invention<br>
for use in a lubrication system of an internal combustion engine. As is more<br>
fully hereinafter described, the variable displacement vane pump 10 provides<br>
for improved regulation of pump outlet flow pressure within a narrow range of<br>
pressures during various engine operating conditions.<br><br>
5<br>
[0018]	As illustrated in FIGS. 1 and 2, the variable displacement vane<br>
pump 10 for use with an internal combustion engine includes a housing 12<br>
having a peripheral wall 14 and a cover 15 (shown schematically in FIG. 1).<br>
The outside of the housing 12 may be mounted to an engine body by a fastener<br>
such as a mounting bolt. A rotor 16 having a plurality of slide vanes 18 is<br>
rotatable in the housing 12 on a fixed axis 20. The rotor 16 may be driven by<br>
a cross-axis hex shaft drive of the engine or other suitable driving means<br>
powered by the engine. The slide vanes 18 internally engage a cam ring 22 to<br>
define pumping chambers 24 within the cam ring 22.<br>
[0019]	The cam ring 22 is pivotally connected to the housing wall 14<br>
by a pivot 26 and is pivotable to vary the displacement of the pumping<br>
chambers 24. The displacement of the pump is proportional to the eccentricity<br>
of the cam ring 22 relative to the axis 20 of the rotor 16. When the pump is at<br>
rest, the cam ring 22 is urged into a position of maximum eccentricity relative<br>
to the rotor 16. When the pump operates with the cam ring 22 in this position,<br>
the displacement of the pump is at its maximum value. As the cam ring 22<br>
pivots away from a position of maximum eccentricity, the displacement of the<br>
pump is reduced and the output flow of the pump generally decreases. When<br>
the center of the cam ring 22 is pivoted to a position at which it is aligned with<br>
the axis 20 of the rotor 16, the cam ring 22 is at 0% eccentricity (i.e., 100%<br>
from its maximum eccentricity) and the pump 10 operates at zero<br>
displacement.<br>
|0020]	An oil inlet port 28 is formed on an inlet side of the housing 12<br>
and a pressurized oil outlet port 30 is formed on an opposite outlet side of the<br>
housing. The inlet and outlet ports 28, 30 preferably communicate with the<br>
pumping chambers 24 on opposite bottom and top sides of the rotor 16 in<br>
order to prevent entrapment of gases in the pumping chambers 24. Rotation of<br>
the rotor 16 at some level of eccentricity causes the pumping chambers 24 to<br><br>
6<br>
expand. This change in chamber volume in turn causes a decompression of<br>
the pumping chambers which causes oil to be sucked into the pumping<br>
chambers 24 through the inlet port 28 and then pushed out of the pumping<br>
chambers 24 through the outlet port 30 as the chambers contract.<br>
[0021]	A control chamber 32 is defined internally by the housing wall<br>
14, the cam ring 22, and a first seal 34 disposed between the housing wall 14<br>
and the cam ring 22. A control orifice 36 is disposed between the control<br>
chamber 32 and the pressurized oil outlet 30 for communicating engine<br>
lubricating oil (i.e., control oil) from the outlet port 30 to the control chamber<br>
32. Alternatively, an oil signal pressure from elsewhere in the engine may be<br>
fed back to the control orifice 36. In any event, the control oil pressure in the<br>
control chamber 32 varies with the oil pressure in the oil lubrication system of<br>
the engine. Control oil pressure in the control chamber 32 exerts a force on<br>
the cam ring 22 capable of causing the cam ring to pivot about the pivot 26.<br>
The pivotal motion of the cam ring 22 may vary the size of the control orifice<br>
36, thereby varying the amount of flow of control oil through the flow orifice<br>
from the pressurized outlet to the control chamber. Varying the size of the<br>
control orifice 36 therefore varies the response of the pump system.<br>
|0022]	Referring also to FIGS. 3 - 5, dump chamber 38 is disposed<br>
adjacent the control chamber 32 and is defined by the housing wall 14, the<br>
cam ring 22, the first seal 34 and a second seal 40. A dump orifice 42<br>
provides for communication of control oil between the control chamber 32 and<br>
the dump chamber 38 and is defined by an intersection of a first groove 44 in<br>
the cam ring 22 and a first groove 46 in the housing cover. Control oil in the<br>
dump chamber 38 is capable of exerting a force on the cam ring 22 that works<br>
in combination with the force exerted by control oil in the control chamber 32<br>
to pivot the cam ring 22 about the pivot 26.<br><br>
7<br>
[0023]	A vent chamber 48 is disposed adjacent the dump chamber 38<br>
and is defined by the housing wall 14, the cam ring 22, and the second seal 40.<br>
The vent chamber 48 is generally kept at or near atmospheric pressure. A vent<br>
orifice 50 connects the dump chamber 38 with the vent chamber 48 for<br>
venting the dump chamber 38 and is defined by an intersection of a second<br>
groove 52 in the cam ring 22 and a second groove 54 in the housing cover.<br>
[0024]	The first grooves 44, 46 and second grooves 52, 54 are<br>
arranged such that pivotal movement of the cam ring 22 in the housing 12<br>
varies the position of the first grooves relative to each other as well as the<br>
position of the second grooves relative to each other. When the first cam ring<br>
groove 44 and first housing cover groove 46 are in alignment, the dump orifice<br>
42 is open and fluid may flow between the control chamber 32 and the dump<br>
chamber 38. As the cam ring 22 pivots away from this position, the first<br>
grooves 44, 46 move out of alignment and the dump orifice 42 closes.<br>
Similarly, when the second cam ring groove 52 and second housing cover<br>
groove 54 are in alignment, the vent orifice 50 is open and dump chamber 38<br>
is in fluid communication with the vent chamber 48. As the cam ring 22<br>
pivots away from this position, the second grooves 52, 54 move out of<br>
alignment and the vent orifice 50 closes.<br>
[0025)	Alternatively, the grooves 44, 46, 52, 54 may be notches or any<br>
other geometry that allows for the flow of fluid. It should be understood that<br>
the specific geometry of the grooves, such as the flow area and length of the<br>
grooves, may be varied to obtain desired flow characteristics for the orifices<br>
42, 50, which in turn affect the response of the pump system 10. Changing the<br>
position of the orifices 42, 50 relative to the seals 34, 40 also may vary the<br>
response of the pump system 10.<br>
[0026]	A resilient member 56, such as a spring, is disposed between<br>
the housing wall 14 and the cam ring 22. The resilient member 56 engages the<br><br>
8<br>
cam ring 22 and urges the cam ring toward the control chamber 32. The<br>
resilient member 56 counters the hydraulic force exerted on the cam ring 22<br>
by control oil in the control chamber 32 and the dump chamber 38.<br>
[0027]	The local pressure in the dump chamber 38 can be biased to<br>
atmospheric pressure or control chamber 32 pressure depending on the<br>
operational conditions of the engine and the pump 10. With reference to<br>
FIGS. 3 and 6, during normal engine operating conditions (i.e., at normal<br>
engine operating temperatures and low to moderate engine speeds), the oil<br>
pressure in the control chamber 32 is sufficient to urge the cam ring 22 to a<br>
position at which the dump orifice 42 is closed and the vent orifice 50 is open.<br>
The dump chamber 38 is therefore open to atmospheric pressure through the<br>
vent chamber 50. Pressurized control oil is only present in the control<br>
chamber 32, and the force of the oil pressure in the control chamber 32 against<br>
the cam ring 22 and the opposing force of the resilient member 56 hold the<br>
cam ring in a position in which the displacement of the pump is sufficient to<br>
maintain the engine oil pressure in a desired range.<br>
|0028]	Turning to FIGS. 4 and 7, during high engine speed operation,<br>
vane pumps typically experience significant flow loss due to cavitation. To<br>
counteract this flow loss, as pump outlet oil pressure decreases, the resulting<br>
reduction of pressure in the control chamber 32 causes the cam ring 22 to<br>
move to a position at which the dump orifice 42 and the vent orifice 50 are<br>
open. In this position, the dump chamber 38 and control chamber 32 are open<br>
to atmospheric pressure, and control oil is permitted to leak from the control<br>
chamber 32 to the vent chamber 48. As a result, the pressure drop across the<br>
control orifice decreases. The pressure decrease in the control chamber 32<br>
causes the resilient member 56, which may be a high rate reaction spring, to<br>
hold the cam ring 22 in a position at which the pump eccentricity is relatively<br>
high. In turn, the pump displacement is therefore sufficiently high in order to<br><br>
9<br>
maintain necessary pump outlet pressure. For example, during high speed<br>
operation, the cam ring 22 may be pivoted to a position that is approximately<br>
40% to 60% of its maximum eccentricity relative to the rotor 16. In some<br>
cases, the position of the cam ring 22 may even be in the range of<br>
approximately 30% to 75% of its maximum eccentricity to obtain the<br>
necessary pump displacement.<br>
[0029]	Turning to FIGS. 5 and 8, during cold engine temperature<br>
operation, the vane pump 10 typically experiences an oil over-pressure<br>
condition. To counteract the excess engine oil pressure, when an over-<br>
pressure condition exists, the cam ring 22 is moved to a position at which the<br>
dump orifice 42 opens and the vent orifice 50 closes. Control oil is thereby<br>
permitted to enter the dump chamber 38 from the control chamber 32. Since<br>
the vent orifice 50 is closed, the dump chamber 38 is not vented. Therefore,<br>
the control oil in the control chamber 32 and the dump chamber 38 is<br>
sufficient to exert a force on the cam ring 22 that overcomes the spring force<br>
and causes the cam ring to pivot such that its center approaches that of the<br>
rotor 16 (i.e., 0% eccentricity). For example, during cold engine temperature<br>
operation, the cam ring 22 may be pivoted to a position that is approximately<br>
10% to 25% of its maximum eccentricity, and in some cases even to a position<br>
that approaches 0% of its maximum eccentricity (i.e., 100% away from its<br>
maximum eccentricity). In this position, pump 10 outlet flow is diminished<br>
sufficiently to clip the lubricating oil pressure outputted from the pump 10.<br><br>
10<br>
[0030]	It should be understood that the response of the pump system<br>
10 may be altered by varying the volume and working area (i.e., area over<br>
which force is exerted by control oil) of the dump chamber 38 with respect to<br>
the volume and working area of the control chamber 32. Further, the spring<br>
force exerted by the reaction spring 56 may also be varied to change the<br>
response of the pump system 10. In doing so, cam ring 22 movement with<br>
respect to control pressure signal can be highly variable.<br>
[0031]	While the invention has been described by reference to certain<br>
preferred embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes could<br>
be made within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described.<br>
Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the disclosed<br>
embodiments, but that it have the full scope permitted by the language of the<br>

the cam ring.<br><br>
15<br>
17.	The pump of claim 12, wherein engine oil in the control<br>
chamber creates a force against the cam ring capable of causing pivotal<br>
movement of the cam ring to alter the displacement of the pump.<br>
18.	The pump of claim 12, wherein engine oil is communicated to<br>
the dump chamber such that engine oil in the control chamber and dump<br>
chamber creates a force against the cam ring capable of causing pivotal<br>
movement of the cam ring to decrease the displacement of the pump.<br>
19.	The pump of claim 12, wherein venting the dump chamber to<br>
the vent chamber via the vent orifice opens the dump chamber to atmospheric<br>
pressure.<br>
20.	The pump of claim 12, wherein venting the dump chamber and<br>
control chamber to the vent chamber via the vent orifice and dump orifice<br>
relieves pressure in the dump chamber and control chamber causing pivotal<br>
movement of the cam ring to increase the displacement of the pump.<br><br>
A variable displacement engine oil vane pump includes a displacement control for controlling displacement of the pump. The control<br>
includes a cam ring in a housing pivotally connected to a wall of the housing by<br>
a pivot. The cam ring is internally engaged by slide vanes. A control chamber is defined by the cam ring and the housing wall. A control orifice provides for communication of control oil from a pressurized source to the control chamber.<br>
