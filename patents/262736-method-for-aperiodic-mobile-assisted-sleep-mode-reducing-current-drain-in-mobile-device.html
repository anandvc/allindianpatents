FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to sleep mode and, more<br>
particularly to aperiodic mobile assisted sleep mode.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Wireless networks such as Enhanced UMTS, 802.16e and the like<br>
are being designed to support the packet switched (PS) domain only.<br>
Traditionally the/user equipment, also known as a mobile station or mobile is<br>
either in .active state with a dedicated connection or in paging or dormant<br>
state (i.e. sleep mode). In paging state the mobile supports discontinuous<br>
reception wherein the mobile sleeps and wakes up at pre-determined<br>
intervals to check if the network has paged it. In 3GPP (UMTS) the mobile<br>
has an additional CELL_FACH state where it continuously monitors the<br>
downlink common control channel for activity.<br>
[0003]	The paging state helps to conserve battery charge by reducing<br>
the average current drain, however at the cost of some latency for downlink<br>
transmissions. The mobile can at any time send an uplink signaling message<br>
to indicate a need to transmit in the uplink. In CELLJFACH state the mobile<br>
is unable to conserve battery charge due to the continuous monitoring of the<br>
control channels.<br>
[0004]	One of the undesirable effects of the paging state is that there<br>
may be data that is to be exchanged with the mobile, however, when the<br><br>
mobile wakes at the predetermined time or frame, radio conditions are poor.<br>
It may also be possible that the mobile was in good conditions while it was in<br>
discontinuous Teception (DRX) state, i.e. paging state, and the network was<br>
unable to communicate with the mobile. This has-the undesirable result<br>
wherein data is exchanged in non-optimum radio conditions leading to the<br>
mobile being awake for a potentially longer tune as a result of retransmission<br>
and in effect negating any potential battery savings. Therefore, it is desirable<br>
to be able to enter a sleep pattern that provides sufficient flexibility to the<br>
scheduler while simultaneously allowing the mobile to save battery whenever<br>
possible.<br>
Moreover, while a mobile is in sleep mode, it is unable to communicate<br>
its channel conditions to the network until after wake-up. Thus the mobile<br>
may wake during undesirable channel conditions such that the mobile may<br>
not be able to communicate with the network or require multiple<br>
retransmissions to the network. In this case the mobiles wakes up and then<br>
. goes back to sleep without any data exchange due to lack of sufficiently good<br>
channel conditions.<br>
[0005]	The various aspects, features and advantages of the present<br>
invention will become more fully apparent to those having ordinary skill in<br>
the art upon careful consideration of the following Detailed Description with<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWTNGS<br>
[0013]	While the present invention is achievable by various forms of<br>
embodiment, there is shown in the drawings and described hereinafter<br>
several examples of embodiments with the understanding that the present<br>
disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the invention and is not<br>
intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments contained herein<br>
as will become more fully apparent from the discussion below. It is further<br>
understood that the method for aperiodic sleep mode of the present invention<br>
may be used more generally in any application where it is desirable to<br>
provide signaling and current drain reduction.<br>
[0014]	It is to be understood that the mobile station (mobile) is a remote<br>
station coupled, wixelessly in this exemplary embodiment, to the network. It<br>
may also be referred to as a mobile, remote station, user equipment, user<br>
terminal or the like. In the embodiment described the mobile is wirelessly<br>
connected to the network though a plurality of base stations and network<br>
controllers. In this exemplary embodiment the mobile enters a sleep mode to<br>
conserve battery charge. It is understood that these are exemplary<br>
embodiments and that other criteria may be used for entering current drain<br>
reduction state.<br>
[0015]	In this exemplary embodiment, the device is an electronic device<br>
such as a radiotelephone. The radiotelephone described herein is a<br>
representation of the type of wireless communication device that may benefit<br>
from the present invention. However, it Is to be understood that the present<br>
invention may be applied to any type of hand-held or portable device<br>
including, but not limited to, the following devices: radiotelephones, cordless<br><br>
phones, paging devices, personal digital assistants, portable computers, pen-<br>
based or keyboard-based handheld devices, remote control units, portable<br>
media players (such as an MP3 or DVD player) that have wueless<br>
communication capability and the like. Accordingly, any reference herein to<br>
the radiotelephone 100 should also be considered to apply equally to other<br>
portable wireless electronic devices.<br>
[0016]	Before describing in detail exemplary embodiments that are in<br>
accordance with the present invention, it should be observed that the<br>
embodiments reside primarily in combinations of method steps and<br>
apparatus components related to sleep mode of an electronic device.<br>
Accordingly, the apparatus components and method steps have been<br>
represented where appropriate by conventional symbols in the drawings,<br>
showing only those specific details that are pertinent to understanding the<br>
embodiments of the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure with<br>
details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having<br>
the benefit of the description herein.<br>
[0017]	The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an<br>
enabling fashion the best modes of making and using various embodiments in<br>
accordance with the present invention. The disclosure is further offered to<br>
enhance an understanding and appreciation for the invention principles and<br>
advantages thereof, rather than to limit in any manner the invention.<br>
[0018]	It is further understood that the use of relational terms, if any,<br>
such as first and second, such as a first timer and a second timer, and the like<br>
are used solely to distinguish one from another entity or action without<br>
necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order<br>
between such entities or actions.<br><br>
[0019]	Disclosed is a method fox aperiodic mobile assisted sleep mode<br>
comprising the steps of receiving from a network a channel condition<br>
threshold. The device enteTS sleep mode and monitors a channel condition.<br>
The mobile exits the sleep mode in response to determining (hat the<br>
monitored channel condition is greater than the channel condition threshold.<br>
[0020]	FIG. 1 illustrates one exemplary process flow diagram for<br>
aperiodic mobile sleep mode. Sleep mode indicates a reduced current drain<br>
state of the device to conserve battery charge also know as sleep state,<br>
dormant state or paging state. In this exemplary embodiment, the mobile<br>
receives 102 from the network a channel condition threshold and a first timer<br>
value. The mobile may also receive a parameter indicating how many frames<br>
"Y" should pass since the last packet transmission or since the transition to<br>
sleep mode, before the mobile can wake and indicate good channel conditions<br>
to the network.<br>
[0021]	Upon entering the sleep mode 104, which is the paging state in<br>
this exemplary embodiment, the mobile performs minimal tasks including<br>
running a first timer, counting frames and monitoring a channel condition.<br>
The mobile starts the first timer 104 to track the length of time the device is in<br>
the sleep mode, which is a maximum length of time the device is in the sleep<br>
mode for this exemplary embodiment. The first timer is associated with the<br>
first timer value received. The first timer expires 114 upon reaching the first<br>
timer value.<br>
[0022]	Concurrently, i.e. while in sleep mode, the mobile station counts<br>
the number of frames that have passed since a predefined event has occurred.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the mobile determines 106 if "Y" frames have<br>
passed since the last reception of information. If "Y" frames have not passed,<br>
the mobile continues to sleep until "Y" frames pass or until the first timer<br><br>
expires 114. If "Y" frames have passed, then the mobile determines 108 if the<br>
measured channel condition is greater than the received channel condition<br>
threshold. The mobile determines this, in this exemplary embodiment, by<br>
turning on a receiver, measuring the channel condition, and then turning off<br>
the receiver. If the measured channel condition is above the threshold, the<br>
mobile exits (i.e. wakes up) 110 from the sleep mode. It is to be understood<br>
that if the mobile is not exchanging data or in the middle of receiving a<br>
plurality of data packets and enters sleep mode, the mobile may or may not<br>
count frames in this exemplary embodiment.<br>
[0023]	As discussed above, once awake, the mobile may then send 112<br>
a message to the network indicating that it is awake (i.e. an awake indication<br>
message) and that the mobile is ready for data exchange (i.e. to or from the<br>
mobile). In this embodiment the message includes a channel quality<br>
indication (CQI) report indicating the channel quality value (i.e. the measured<br>
channel condition) or that the channel quality is above the threshold.<br>
Alternatively, in another exemplary embodiment, the awake indication<br>
message includes a buffer indication which can be composed of buffer<br>
occupancy information as well as buffer QoS information.<br>
[0024]	Contmuing with the exemplary embodiment of HG. 1, the time<br>
it takes for "Y" frames to pass is typically set less than the first timer value.<br>
Tracking the number of frames, "Y frames" that has passed since the last data<br>
reception ensures that when there is data to be sent, good channel conditions<br>
are exploited in this embodiment by a data transmission scheduler. For<br>
example, "Y" frames are counted to ensure that the mobile does not wake up<br>
promptly upon entering sleep mode due to being in good channel conditions<br>
(i.e. greater than the threshold), as the scheduler may not be ready to schedule<br>
the mobile so soon after the last transmission to the mobile. Defining a finite<br><br>
time, i.e. "Y" frames, before scheduling a next transmission to the mobile also<br>
helps maintain equity in opportunities for data transmission and reception<br>
among the different mobiles in a cell. In this embodiment, the mobile does<br>
not count frames specifically but uses a second timer which is then used to<br>
determine the number of frames that have passed because in this embodiment<br>
frames are defined by a finite time duration. In another example, if the device<br>
is receiving a data set and there is a long enough pause in reception between<br>
data packets or portions, the mobile may enter sleep mode due to the need for<br>
reading time of the received data (e.g. web page) by the user in case of web<br>
browsing and thus lack of further requests for more data in the interim<br>
period. The "Y" frame counter, e.g. second timer, will allow the mobile to<br>
wake, as long as the measured channel conditions are above the threshold,<br>
and then Teceive the remainder of the data set. In this embodiment, the<br>
mobile will not wait until the first timer expires to wake from sleep mode.<br>
[0025]	If the mobile determines 106 "Y" frames have passed and<br>
determines 108 that the monitored channel condition is not greater than or<br>
equal to the received channel condition threshold, the mobile will continue to<br>
monitor the channel condition and awake when the channel condition is<br>
greater than the threshold or awake when the first timer has expired 114. It<br>
should be noted that the action of monitoring channel conditions requires<br>
lower power expenditure in the mobile than being fully awake and<br>
monitoring control channels for scheduling messages. In response to the<br>
channel condition improving above the threshold, the mobile exits 110 from<br>
the sleep mode. The mobile then may send 112 a message to the network<br>
indicating that it is awake. The mobile may also include in the message the<br>
CQI report, a channel condition identity and the like. The channel condition<br><br>
identity indicates to the network which channel condition is being sent in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
[0026]	As discussed above, the first timer starts when the mobile enters<br>
sleep mode. If the timer has expired, the mobile wakes up 120. In this case it<br>
is not necessary to indicate to the network that the mobile is awake since fhe<br>
network has configured the mobile to wake up at these intervals defined by<br>
the first timer in this embodiment. The mobile may however indicate if s<br>
channel condition on wake up in order to assist the network in scheduling<br>
data transmissions. This ensures that although the channel conditions may<br>
not be as desired, the mobile will communicate with the network and not<br>
sleep for an undesired length of time and miss incorning calls for example.<br>
[0027]	It is understood that one of ordinary skill in the art will.<br>
appreciate that a plurality of channel conditions may be monitored. For<br>
•example, the channel quality may be indicated by the signal to noise ratio, bit<br>
error rate, frame error rate or the like. The channel condition threshold may<br>
be set by the network operator to satisfy data scheduling in order to optimize<br>
efficiency of the system and other attributes that relate to signal quality that<br>
may be based a plurality of attributes. For example, the scheduler of the<br>
network may target transmissions to the mobile based on a number of factors<br>
and may base the channel condition threshold and the first timer value on the<br>
traffic quality of service (QoS) class, the channel conditions of the mobile,<br>
buffering capability at the network, last time mobile was served (e.g. fairness<br>
criterion) and the like.<br>
[0028]	In another embodiment, the channel condition threshold is<br>
adapted by the mobile to a level within preset tolerances or channel condition<br>
threshold limits. For example, the mobile may adapt to a channel condition<br>
threshold between an upper channel condition threshold limit and a lower<br><br>
channel condition threshold limit. The threshold limits may be specified by<br>
•the network to the mobile. This allows the mobile to account for changes in<br>
nominal channel conditions. For example, if a mobile enters a building with<br>
15 dB penetration loss then the mobile would adapt or change the threshold<br>
so that a desired mean time between wake ups is achieved. In one<br>
embodiment, the mobile receives from the network a channel condition upper<br>
threshold limit and channel condition lower threshold limit. The mobile may<br>
then select the threshold as long as the threshold is between the upper limit<br>
and the lower limit to achieve a mean tune between wake ups.<br>
[0029]	Once the mobile is awake it may either have data to send to the<br>
network or the network may have data to send to the mobile. If the mobile,<br>
has data to send, orice awake, the mobile begins the data exchange procedure<br>
to send the data, and the mobile indicates to the network it has data to send. •<br>
If the mobile does not have data to send, the mobile must determine whether<br>
the network has data to send to it and whether it should re-enter sleep mode.<br>
[0030]	Data reception from the network may occur by a plurality of<br>
methods. In one exemplary embodiment, after the mobile sends the awake<br>
indication message, the mobile remains awake to receive data within the next<br>
frames. For example, once the network receives the awake indication<br>
message, the network will begin sending data to the mobile within the next<br>
immediately available transmission frame. In this embodiment the mobile<br>
remains awake and begins to receive the data. If the mobile does not receive<br>
any data or a data pending indicator, the mobile will reenter the sleep mode<br>
and continue with the method discussed above.<br>
[0031]	In one exemplary embodiment, after the mobile sends the awake<br>
indication message, the mobile waits for a period of X frames which may be<br>
deterrnined by a third timer, for an indication from the network that there is<br><br>
data waiting to be sent to the mobile. As discussed above, if the mobile does<br>
not receive anything from the network within X frames, it re-enters sleep<br>
mode.<br>
[0032]	In this exemplary embodiment X is associated with the number<br>
of frames the network needs to process the received CQI report and schedule<br>
a transmission of the waiting data for example. It is to be understood that the<br>
number of frames, X, may be related to other network parameters such as<br>
scheduling due to network congestion, data size, data type or the like.<br>
[0033]	FIG. 2 illustrates an exemplary process flow diagram for data<br>
exchange after the mobile exits sleep mode. In this exemplary embodiment,<br>
the mobile, after waking up, receives 202 a pending downlink (DL) data<br>
indication. In one embodiment the network indicates 202, for e.g. in frame<br>
"Z," that it has data and it will be scheduled, based on the channel condition<br>
knowledge of the mobile. The mobile maybe required to monitor<br>
continuously for a scheduling message or the network may indicate when the<br>
mobile will receive a scheduling message for e.g. after X frames. After<br>
receiving the DL data indication, the mobile may sleep 204 until the data is to<br>
be received, i.e. wait Z+X frames, then wake up 206 in time to receive the data<br>
in Z+X frames. The number of frames, Z+X, represents that the data will be<br>
transmitted from the network "X" frames past frame "Z." It should also be<br>
noted that "X" may also equal zero and therefore receive that data beginning<br>
at frame "Z."<br>
[0034]	FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary scheduling mechanism time<br>
sequence for aperiodic mobile sleep mode. FIG. 3 shows frames 300 of the<br>
sequence in which data is scheduled to be transmitted or received by the<br>
mobile. FIG. 3 illustrates that the mobile wakes up in frame two 302 and<br>
indicates to the network that it is awake. The mobile in frame three 304<br><br>
receives a pending downlink (DL) data indication. In this embodiment the<br>
mobile remains awake through at least frames four through eight 306 and<br>
continuously monitors for data from the network.<br>
[0035]	FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative exemplary scheduling<br>
mechanism time sequence for aperiodic mobile sleep mode. FIG. 4 shows<br>
frames 400 of the sequence in which data is scheduled to be transmitted or<br>
received by the mobile. FIG. 4 in conjunction with FIG. 2 illustrates that the<br>
mobile wakes up in frame two 402 and indicates to the network that it is<br>
awake. The mobile in frame three 404 receives a pending downlink (DL) data<br>
indication and the mobile receives an indication as to when the mobile will<br>
receive a scheduling message, for example at frame "X." In this embodiment<br>
the mobile may then enter sleep mode in frame four 406 and wake in frame<br>
"X", which is frame eight 408 in this exemplary embodiment.<br>
[0036]	La this exemplary embodiment, the mobile may continue to<br>
sleep between frames Z and X, and may also continue to monitor the channel<br>
condition and wake up prior to the pre-determined time (e.g. the first timer<br>
expiring) if the channel condition increases above the threshold. However, if<br>
the first timer expires at any time, regardless of the channel condition, the<br>
mobile wakes up 120 and may send an indication to the network that it is<br>
awake and waits for a traffic-awaitrng-for-rnobile indication.<br>
[0037]	In yet another exemplary embodiment of frames 500 for a<br>
scheduling mechanism time sequence, illustrated in FIG. 5, the network may .<br>
also indicate, with the pending data indicator, the resource allocation to the<br>
mobile. The mobile, after waking in frame two 502, receives in frame three<br>
504 the scheduling message thereby allowing for a faster delivery of data, i.e.<br>
sending the data as immediately as possible with high speed networks,<br>
instead of sending the pending data indicator as discussed above.<br><br>
[0038]	Other parameters in addition to channel condition may be used<br>
to determine when the mobile wakes from sleep mode. In one exemplary<br>
embodiment, the mobile can wake and provide its channel condition and an<br>
attribute linked to its current speed or estimated Doppler of the device. For<br>
example, if the device is moving at a high rate of speed, the probability that<br>
the channel condition will improve quickly is greater than if the mobile<br>
station is moving at a slow rate of speed. The network may instruct the<br>
mobile to go back to sleep until a certain change in channel condition or until<br>
a certain second timer has expired depending on the received attribute. A<br>
shorter timer may be established when the mobile is moving at a relatively<br>
high rate of speed such as in a moving vehicle on an expressway. In another<br>
exemplary embodiment, the mobile is stationary and the probability that the<br>
channel condition will improve quickly is lower. In this case the network may,<br>
have some data foT the mobile and may upon detenxiiriing that the data is of<br>
background traffic QoS class, instructs the mobile to go to sleep until some<br>
improvement in channel conditions occurs given the network's current load.<br>
In any condition, the mobile may reset these parameters upon changing the<br>
serving cell.<br>
[0039]	In yet another embodiment, when the data to be exchanged<br>
belongs to a background QoS class, the network may provide an indication to<br>
the mobile that there is data pending but that the mobile should not expect<br>
reception until the mobile channel condition improves. The network may<br>
require the channel condition to improve above the channel condition<br>
•threshold or provided another threshold to the mobile. In this exemplary<br>
embodiment, the mobile may also use a third independent value that has been<br>
pre-determined and stored in the mobile. In this embodiment, the mobile<br>
reports that it is awake to the network once it reaches this value. In this<br><br>
exemplary embodiment, the mobile station exits 120 sleep mode after the first<br>
time has expired and while the channel condition is below the channel<br>
condition threshold. The mobile receives a pending data indication but the<br>
mobile also receives a message to go back to sleep until the measured channel<br>
condition is greater than or equal to the channel condition threshold. Ixvtrus<br>
embodiment, the network determins that the data is of lower priority, that it is<br>
background QoS class data in this exemplary embodiment, and that the<br>
mobile should sleep until there are better channel conditions to receive the<br>
data. The network may also determine that the data requires a certain level of<br>
QoS and therefore instruct the mobile to resume sleep mode until the channel<br>
condition improve to a level appropriate for the required QoS.<br>
10040]	The mobile station may enter and exit sleep mode following a<br>
plurality of sleep and wake patterns which are known as discontinuous<br>
reception (DRX) modes in one exemplary communication system, wherein, the<br>
time that the mobile is in sleep mode and the time the mobile is awake is<br>
derived from a predefined discontinuous pattern. In this exemplary<br>
embodiment, the mobile has a plurality of DRX patterns (also referred to as<br>
modes) that are used in the paging state to maximize energy efficiency (i.e.<br>
current drain on the battery). The DRX mode used, in this exemplary<br>
embodiment, depends upon the mobiles current estimate (i.e. measurement)<br>
of the channel condition and whether the measured value is above or below<br>
the channel condition threshold.<br>
[0041]	In addition this could also be based on network provisioning of<br>
the channel condition threshold. The mobile indicates to the network that it is<br>
awake, checks to see if data is buffered and goes to sleep on receiving no<br>
indication of pending data or the data itself. The mobile indicates to the<br>
network that it is awake (including a channel condition report) as opposed to<br><br>
awaking at some predetermined times. During bad channel conditions the<br>
mobile may prefer to sleep longer in order to ensure that too much battery is<br>
not wasted in receiving data through multiple retransmission attempts, esp.<br>
when the data to be received is of a background QoS class (such as email<br>
download). By ensuring more frequent wake-ups during good channel<br>
conditions we can ensure that less data needs to be buffered at the network<br>
and also that a smaller amount of such un-sent data will need to be sent over<br>
to the target base station on change of serving cell.<br>
[0042]	Note that in all embodiments., the mobile may have another<br>
overlapping DRX cycle that is deterrnined by the network based on the<br>
maximum delay tolerable for voice. Then, even when the mobile is in<br>
comparably bad channel conditions, the mobile may still need to be scheduled<br>
for terminating a voice cail for example. It is also possible to receive different<br>
thresholds based on traffic type. For example, a higher threshold being set for<br>
high-rate data services and lower threshold for low-rate data services. For<br>
example, for voice data exchange, a low data rate service can be delivered<br>
even without the best possible channel conditions. With voice service there is<br>
little flexibility in terms of having to schedule the mobile (i.e. when a user<br>
ends a call, signaling should occur relatively quickly); however, for data<br>
applications there is sufficient flexibility that can be exploited given sufficient<br>
mechanisms for communication between mobile and network. In this case,<br>
upon wake-up, the mobile may indicate which of the channel quality-<br>
thresholds it is currently meeting. In the case where the mobile has been<br>
provided with a first and second channel condition threshold corresponding<br>
to the different QoS requirements for example, the mobile may initially be in<br>
channel conditions that exceed the first channel condition threshold but not<br>
the second channel condition threshold. The mobile then indicates to the<br><br>
network that it's channel condition exceeds the first threshold and the<br>
network may schedule the mobile if there is data to be transmitted. When the<br>
mobile's measurement of the channel conditions exceeds the second channel<br>
condition threshold, it will send another indication that ifs channel condition<br>
has exceeded the second channel condition threshold, following which it may<br>
be scheduled by the network.<br>
It will be appreciated that embodiments of the invention described<br>
herein may be comprised of or performed by one or more conventional<br>
processors and unique stored program instructions that control the one or<br>
more processors to implement, in conjunction with certain non-processor<br>
circuits, some, most, or all of the functions of aperiodic mobile sleep mode<br>
described herein. The non-processor circuits may include, but are not limited<br>
to, aradio receiver, a radio transmitter, signal drivers, clock circuits, power<br>
source circuits, and user input devices. As such, these functions may be<br>
interpreted as steps of a method to perform aperiodic sleep mode.<br>
Alternatively, some or all functions could be implemented by a state machine<br>
that has no stored program instructions/ or in one or more application specific<br>
integrated circuits (ASICs), in which each, function or some combinations of<br>
certain of the functions are implemented as custom logic. Of course, a<br>
combination of the two approaches could be used. Thus, methods and means<br>
for these functions have been described herein. Further, it is expected that<br>
one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many<br>
design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology,<br>
and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles<br>
disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software<br>
instructions and programs and ICs with minimal experimentation.<br><br>

to be the best modes thereof have been described in a manner that establishes<br>
possession thereof by the inventors and that enables those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art to make and use the inventions/ it will be understood and appreciated<br>
that there are many equivalents to the exemplary embodiments disclosed<br>
