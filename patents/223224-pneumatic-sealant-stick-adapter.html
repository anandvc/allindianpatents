The operational details of the invention with reference to the Figure 1 to 16 are as under:<br>
OPERATIONAL DETAILS<br>
The following steps have to be followed for sealant or semisolid compound or cold weld compound removal from sealant stick (Figure-3) by "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" and inject into high pressure leaking valve or pipe line by hydraulic pressure, using high pressure hydraulic cylinder (Figure-5) or pressure intensifier (Figure-6).<br>
1)	At "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER", three way selector valve has to be selected to vent line (Figure-2 No.4). Sealant stick (Figure-3) has to be inserted into sealant stick barrel (Figure-4). Piston seal assembly (Figure-2) with piston (Figure-1) has to be latched with sealant stick barrel and cam lock (Figure-4 No.1) has to be closed this gives the air tight sealing between, male(Figure-2 No.6) and female cam lock coupling(Figure-4 No.1), sealant stick (Figure-3) and piston(Figure-l) and sealant stick (Figure-3) with sealant stick barrel(Figure-4).<br>
2)	At the hydraulic piston cylinder (Figure-5) or pressure intensifier (Figure-6) arrangement the following valves has to be in closed, isolation ball valve (Figure-5 No.8) from "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER", isolation ball valve (Figure-5 No.9) for sealant or semisolid compound or cold weld compound inlet to hydraulic cylinder(Figure-5 No.4) or pressure intensifier (Figure-6 No.5) and isolation ball valve(Figure-5 No. 10) to the valve where sealant has to be injected. At hydraulic piston cylinder, hydraulic line three way valve has to be selected to hydraulic oil reservoir (Figure-5 No.5&amp;7) or at pressure intensifier hydraulic pressure equalisation valve (Figure-6 No.6) has to be opened .<br>
3)	After ensuring steps 1&amp;2, "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" has to be latched to hydraulic piston cylinder arrangement or pressure intensifier, by connecting female cam lock connector at hydraulic piston cylinder arrangement end (Figure-5 No.1) or pressure intensifier end(Figure-6 No.1), with male cam<br><br><br><br>
lock connector at "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" end ( Figure-4 No.7).<br>
4)	After ensuring steps 1.2&amp;3 sealant injection into the leaking high pressure valve can be carried out in two stages.<br>
5)	First stage involves injection of sealant or semisolid compound or cold weld compound into the hydraulic cylinder (Figure-5 No.4) or pressure intensifier (Figure-6 No.5) by "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" using pneumatic pressure (Figure-2 No.2), with the following sequence.<br>
a.	Isolation ball valve (Figure-5 No.8) from "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK<br>
ADAPTER" has to be opened.<br>
b.	Isolation ball valve (Figure-5 No.9) for sealant or semisolid compound or<br>
cold weld compound inlet to hydraulic cylinder(Figure-5 No.4) or pressure<br>
intensifier cylinder (Figure-6 No.5) has to be opened.<br>
c.	And three way selector valve has to be selected to pressure source (Figure-<br>
2 No.2).<br>
Sealant semisolid compound or cold weld compound get injected into hydraulic cylinder (Figure-5 No.4) or pressure intensifier cylinder (Figure-6 No.5). This can be ensured by inward movement of "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" piston (Figure-1 No.5). In case of hydraulic cylinder arrangement, this can be ensured by outward movement of hydraulic piston(Figure-5 No.4). In case pressure intensifier no visible observation at the pressure intensifier end can be seen as the pressure intensifier piston is not projecting outside.<br>
6)	Second stage involves injection of sealant or semisolid compound or cold weld<br>
compound into high pressure leaking valve or pipe line from hydraulic cylinder<br>
(Figure-5 No.4) or pressure intensifier cylinder (Figure-6 No.5) using hydraulic<br>
pressure source (Figure-5 No.6 and Figure-6 No.4), with the following<br>
sequence.<br>
a. Isolation ball valve (Figure-5 No.8) from "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" has to be closed<br><br>
b.	Isolation ball valve (Figure-5 No.9) from hydraulic cylinder(Figure-5 No.4) or<br>
pressure intensifier cylinder (Figure-6 No.5) has to be opened<br>
c.	Hydraulic piston cylinder arrangement three way valve has to be selected to<br>
hydraulic power source (Figure-5 No.5&amp;6).<br>
d.	At pressure intensifier hydraulic pressure equalisation valve (Figure-6 No.6)<br>
has to be in closed and hydraulic power source has to be supplied at the<br>
rear end of pressure intensifier.<br>
e.	Isolation ball valve to the valve or pipe line where sealant or semisolid<br>
compound or cold weld compound to be injected has to be opened (Figure-5<br>
No. 10).<br>
Sealant or semisolid compound or cold weld compound get injected into high pressure leaking valve or pipe line. This can be ensured by inward movement of hydraulic piston(Figure-5 No.4). In case pressure intensifier hydraulic oil comes out at the forward end of the pressure intensifier indicating discharge stroke of the pressure intensifier. And isolation ball valve(Figure-5 No. 10) to the valve where sealant has to be injected has to be opened. .<br>
7)	"PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" pneumatic pressure venting and<br>
hydraulic pressure bleed off:<br>
a) After ensuring all the three isolation ball valves (Figure-5 No.8,9&amp;10) in closed condition. By selecting pneumatic three way valve of "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" to vent line (Figure-2 No.4), pressure inside "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" can be depressurised. By selecting hydraulic piston cylinder assembly three way valve to bleed port (Figure-5 No.6), hydraulic pressure inside the hydraulic piston cylinder assembly can be depressurised. At pressure intensifier, hydraulic pressure equalisation valve (Figure-6 No.6) has to be opened<br>
8)	Dismantling of "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER" (Figure-13).<br>
a. After ensuring step 7, Cam lock at sealant stick barrel end (Figure-4 No.1) has to be opened. By removing male cam lock (Figure-2 No.6) attached with piston seal assembly (Figure-2) from Cam lock at sealant stick barrel end<br><br><br>
(Figure-4 No.1), piston seal assembly (Figure-2), piston (Figure-1) and sealant stick (Figure-3) can be removed together from sealant stick barrel..<br>
9) Removal  of hydraulic  piston  cylinder assembly  (Figure-14)  or  pressure intensifier (Figure-15) from "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER".<br>
a. After ensuring step 7, hydraulic pressure inside the hydraulic cylinder (Figure-5 No.4) depressurised, cam lock (Figure-5 No.1) at the hydraulic piston cylinder (Figure-5 No.7) or pressure intensifier (Figure-6 No.1) has to be opened and the hydraulic piston cylinder assembly (Figure-5) or pressure intensifier (Figure-6) can be detached from "PNEUMATIC SEALANT STICK ADAPTER".<br>
io)   The above procedures have to be repeated for every sealant stick.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in detail, those skilled in the art should understand that they can make various changes , substitutions and alterations herein without departing the spirit and scope of the invention in its broadest form.<br><br>
