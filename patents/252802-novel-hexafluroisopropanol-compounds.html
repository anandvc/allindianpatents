Liver-X-Receptors (LXRs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. The LXRs are activated by endogenous oxysterols and regulate the transcription of genes controlling multiple metabolic pathways. Two subtypes, LXRalpha and LXRbeta, have been described (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995, 9:1033-45; Song et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.1994, 91:10809-13). LXRbeta is ubiquitously expressed, while LXRalpha is predominantly expressed in cholesterol metabolizing tissues such as the iiver, adipose, intestine and macrophage. The LXRs modulate a variety of physiological responses including regulation of cholesterol absorption, cholesterol elimination (bile acid synthesis), and transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues via plasma lipoproteins to the liver. The LXRs are also involved in glucose metabolism, cholesterol metabolism in the brain, cell differentiation, and inflammation.<br>
At present, approximately half of all patients with coronary artery disease have low concentrations of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The atheroprotective function of HDL was first highlighted almost 25 years ago and stimulated exploration of the genetic and environmental factors that influence HDL-C levels (Miller NE., Lipids 1978,13:914-9). The protective function of HDL derives from its role in a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. HDL mediates the removal of cholesterol from cells in peripheral tissues, including macrophage foam cells in the atherosclerotic lesions of the arterial wall. HDL delivers its cholesterol to the liver and sterol-metaboiizing organs for conversion to bile and elimination in feces. Studies have shown that HDL-C<br>
levels are predictive of coronary artery disease risk independently of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (Gordon et al., Am J Med. 1977,62:707-14).<br>
At present, the estimated age-adjusted prevalence among Americans age 20 and older who have HDL-C of less than 35 mg/dl is 16% (males) and 5.7 % (females). A substantial increase of HDL-C is currently achieved by treatment with niacin in various formulations. However, the substantial unfavorable side-effects limit the therapeutic potential of this approach.<br>
It has been observed that as many as 90% of the 14 million diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients in the United States are overweight or obese, and a high proportion of type 2 diabetic patients have abnormal concentrations of lipoproteins. Studies have shown that the prevalence of total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dl is 37% in diabetic men and 44% in women. The rates for LDL-C &gt; 160 mg/dl are 31% and 44%, and for HDL-C 
The first line of treatment for dyslipidemia and diabetes at present generally involves a low-fat and low-glucose diet, exercise and weight loss. However, compliance can be moderate, and as the disease progresses, treatment of the various metabolic deficiencies becomes necessary with lipid-modulating agents such as statins and fibrates for dyslipidemia, and hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas, metformin, or insulin sensitizers of the thiazolidinedione (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists, for insulin resistance. Recent studies provide evidence that modulators of LXRs would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, and as such, modulators of LXRs should improve the plasma lipid profile, and raise HDL-C levels (Lund et al., Arterioscler. Thromb. Vase. Biol. 2003, 23:1169-77). LXRs are also known to control the efflux of cholesterol from the macrophage foam cell of the atherosclerotic lesion, and agonists of LXRs have been shown to be atheroprotective (Joseph and Tontonoz, Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003, 3:192-7)<br>
Thus, modulators of LXRs would be effective treatments for the atherosclerotic disease which underlies the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of stroke and heart disease. Recent observations also suggest that there is an independent LXR mediated effect on insulin-sensitization in addition to its role in atheroprotection (Cao et al., J Biol Chem. 2003, 278:1131-6). Thus LXR modulators can also show superior therapeutic efficacy on HDL-raising and atheroprotection, with additional effects on diabetes, compared to current therapies.<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention have been found to bind to and selectively activate LXR alpha and LXR beta or coactivate LXR alpha and LXR beta. Consequently, cholesterol absorption is reduced, HDL cholesterol is increased, and inflammatory atherosclerosis is reduced Since multiple facets of combined dyslipidemia and cholesterol homeostasis are addressed by LXR modulators, novel compounds of the present invention have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art. They can therefore be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists. Such diseases include increased lipid and cholesterol levels, particularly low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, particularly non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, Alzheimer's disease, sepsis, and inflammatorv diseases such as colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis/fibrosis of the liver, psoriasis and other inflammatory diseases of the skin, and diseases that have an inflammatory component such as Alzheimer's disease or impaired/improvable cognitive function. Moreover, the novel compounds of the present invention can be used for treatment and prophylaxis of age-related and inherited (e.g. Stargardt's disease) forms of macular degeneration.<br>
Other compounds that bind to and activate LXR alpha and LXR beta have previously been suggested (e.g.: WO 03/099769). However, there is still a need for new compounds with improved properties. The present invention provides the novel compounds of formula (I) which bind to LXR alpha and/or LXR beta. The compounds of the present invention unexpectedly exhibit improved pharmacological properties compared to the compounds known in the art, concerning e.g. metabolic stability, bioavailability and activity.<br>

It will be appreciated that the compounds of general formula (I) in this invention may be derivatised at functional groups to provide derivatives which are capable of conversion back to the parent compound in vivo.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for the manufacture of compounds of formula (I) as defined above, which process comprises<br>
a) reacting a compound of formula (II)<br><br><br><br>
with a compound LG-CHR3-(CH2)m-(CR4R5)n-R6, or<br>
b) reacting a compound of formula (III)<br>
R<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
with a compound LG-R2,<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, m and n are as defined above and LG is a leaving group.<br>
The reaction of a compound of formula (II) with a compound LG-CHR3-(CH2)m-(CR4R5)n-R6 or of a compound of formula (III) with a compound LG-R2 can be performed under reaction conditions well known to the person skilled in the art. Such reactions can conveniently be carried out in a solvent such as e.g. DMF, THF, acetonitrile or acetone, optionally in the presence of a base such as e.g. DIPEA or K2CO3, at a suitable temperature, e.g. in the range of 20 - 200° C. Suitable leaving groups are well known in the art, e.g.<br>
halogenide (I, Br, Cl), triflate (OTf), mesylate (OMs), tosylate (OTs), or para-nitrophenolate.<br>
The present invention also relates to compounds of formula (I) as defined above, when prepared by a process as described above.<br>
The preparation of compounds of formula (I) as defined above, is illustrated in scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Treatment of an aniline la/b (PG = optional protective group) with LG-R2 (wherein LG is a leaving group such as e.g. Cl, Br, I, MsO, TsO, or TfO) or with an acylating agent (a carboxylic acid anhydride or carboxylic acid chloride such as e.g. trifluoroacetic acid anhydride or benzoyl chloride) and subsequent reduction of the intermediate amide (e.g. with BH3) leads to 2a/b (step a). Alternatively the formation of the intermediate amide may also be carried out by treatment of la/b with a carboxylic acid in presence of e.g. EDCI and HOBT or other typical reagents used for the formation of amides from carboxylic acids. The "(CHR3)(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6"-moiety is introduced in step b by reaction of 2a/b with a compound "LG-(CHR3)(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6'. Alternatively, 2a/b can be treated with an acylating agent such as ClOC(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6 in presence of a base or with a carboxylic acid HOOC(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6 in the presence of e.g. EDCI and HOBT or other typical reagents used for the formation of amides from carboxylic acids. The resulting amide intermediate is reduced (e.g. with BH3) to give derivatives with R3 = H. If 2a/b is treated with oxirane 5, optionally in the presence of a Lewis acid such as e.g. lithiumperchlorate or ZnCl2 (in analogy to e.g.: Chini et al.,J. Org. Chem., 1991, 56(20) 5939-5942; Duran Pachon et al., Tet. Lett, 2003, 44(32) 6025-6027), derivatives with m = 0, n = 1 and R5 = OH can be obtained. The methods used for the introduction of the "(CHR3)(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6"-moiety can also be applied to la/b (step c). The R2-substituent is introduced subsequently into 4a/b according to the methods described above<br>
(step d). If step d is incompatible with functional groups present in 4a/b, these maybe suitably protected prior to the introduction of R2 and deprotected again thereafter. O-protected derivatives Ib may be obtained from la according to standard literature procedures used for the protection of alcohols (e.g. treatment of la with a silylating agent such as TESC1 in the presence of a suitable base such as DBU). The conditions for the introduction of some O-protecting groups (e.g. O-benzylation with benzylbromide in presence of K2CO3) may require the prior protection of the amino group (e.g. by bocylation with Boc2O) which is deprotected again after protection of the hydroxyl group. The removal of both O- and N-protecting groups - if desired or required - is carried out according to appropriate standard procedures generally known to those skilled in the art (e.g. N-debocylation in presence of TFA or N-desilylation with TBAF). Typical conditions for the introduction and removal of protecting groups may e.g. be found in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, 2nd Ed., 1991, Wiley N.Y.<br>
Derivatives with R4 = hydroxy may be converted to derivatives with R4 = alkoxy, aryl-lower-alkoxy- and heterocydyl-lower-alkoxy by treatment with a reagent LG-R11, wherein R1 = loweralkyl, aryl-lower-alkyl or heterocyclyl-lower-alkyl in the presence of a base such as e.g. K2CO3. Derivatives with R4 = hydroxy and R5 = H may be oxidized (i.e. CR4R5 is converted to C=O) and treated with an organometal such as e.g. Li-R5 or BrMg-R5, wherein R5 is lower-alkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl, to give derivatives with R4 = hydroxyl and R5 = lower-alkyl, aryl or heterocyclyl. If required, functional groups (e.g. present in R6) incompatible with conditions used for the mentioned transformations of R4 and R5, may be suitably protected and deprotected again later (according to procedures given e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, 2nd Ed., 1991, Wiley N.Y.).<br>
Derivatives la/b - 4a/b with R1 = H may be converted to derivatives with R1= halogen by treatment with a halogenating agent such as e.g. NCS, NBS, NIS, or N-fluoro-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amine. Derivatives la/b -4a/b with R1 = lower-alkyl maybe obtained from derivatives with R1 = H in one step by Friedel-Crafts alkylation or in two steps by Friedel-Crafts acylation and subsequent reduction of the carbonyl group (e.g. by Wolff-Kishner- or Clemmensen-type reductions). Alternatively derivatives with R = Cl, Br, or I may be subjected to a metal-halogen-exchange reaction with e.g. BuLi or EtMgBr and then treated with an alleviating agent such as e.g. an alkyliodide. Instead of the alkylating agent, an aldehyde CHOalkyl may be used, leading to a derivative with R' = 1-hydroxyalkyl, that may be deoxygenated e.g. by hydrogenolysis in presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C, or by treatment with a reducing agent such as e.g. BH3 Me2S or Et3Si-H optionally in presence of an acid or Lewis acid such as e.g. TFA or BF3 OEt2 (e.g. in analogy to Pearlstein et al., Bioorg. and Med. Chem. Lett., 2003, 13, 1829-1835; Mewshaw et al.,<br><br>
Bioorg. and Med, Chem. Lett, 2002,12, 307-310; Sakagani et al., Synlett 1996,163 - 164). If necessary, sensitive functional groups present in la/b - 4a/b, maybe suitably protected prior to the preparation of derivatives with R1 = halogen or lower-alkyl and deprotected again at a later stage (e.g. according to procedures given in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, 2nd Ed., 1991, Wiley N.Y.).<br>
A large number of compounds LG-(CHR3)(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6 in which R1 to R6, L, m, n, and LG are defined as above are commercially available. If not they may be prepared from a related commercially available starting material such as e.g. an alcohol HO-(CHR3)-(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6, an ester alkylOOC-(CH2)m-(CR4R5)nR6, or a carboxylic acid HOOC-(CH2)m- (CR4R5)nR6 according to standard literature procedures commonly known to those skilled in the art. If not commercially available, halogenides of the structure halogen-(CHR3)-(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6, wherein halogen = Cl or Br and either R3 = aryl or heterocyclyl or both m and n = 0, may be prepared from e.g. H2CR3-(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6by treatment with NCS or NBS, respectively (e.g. Togo et al. Syn. Lett., 2003,702 - 704). Oxiranes such as 5 may be prepared by treatment of l-bisfunctionalized ethenes C(HR3)=C(R5R6) with a commonly used epoxidizing agent such as mCPBA (e.g. Durley et al., J. Med. Chem,, 2002, 45,18, 3891-3904; Tian et al., Org. Lett., 3, 12, 2001,1929 - 1932). Many of the LG-(CHR3)(CH2)m(CR4R5)nR6 wherein R3, R4, R5 = H, and R6 = heterocyclyl may be prepared according to literature procedures (e.g. Binggeli et al. WO200292084 and WO97019311, Bouillot et al. WO2004006922; Morita et al., JP9095482; Cynkowski et al., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1995,2335-2336; Kodama et al., US6472386; Faul et al., Heterocycles, 2001, 55 (4), 689 - 704)<br>
After preparation of 3a/b according to the synthetic descriptions above, functional groups present in R6 may optionally be further derivatized. Examples for typical transformations of such functional groups are summarized below:<br>
Benzyloxy is typically transformed to hydroxy; hydroxy to lower-alkoxy, R8-O-C(O)-lower-alkoxy, and RaRb-NC(O)-lower-alkoxy; Ra-O-C(O)-, to hydroxymethyl and HO-C(O); HO-C(O) to RaRbNC(O);hydroxymethyl to formyl, wherein the just mentioned functional groups may be present alone or form part of a larger functional group and wherein R" and R independently from each other are hydrogen or lower alkyl. Procedures for these transformations are found in large number in literature and are commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Formyl may typically be transformed to 1-hydroxyalkyl, by addition of an alkylmagnesium halogenide or an alkyllithium. The formyl group may be derivatized to a 2-(loweralkyl-O-C(O))-l-hydroxy ethyl group e.g. by Zn(0)-mediated addition of an oc-bromoacetic acid<br><br>
ester (.Reformatsky-reaction). If the 2-(loweralkyl-O-C(O))-l-hydroxy ethyl is formed from a formyl group directly attached to an aryl or a heterocyclyl, transformation to the alkoxycarbonylethyl-group may be carried out by deoxygenation, e.g. by hydrogenolysis in presence of a catalyst such as Pd/C, or by treatment with a reducing agent such as e.g. BHs'Me2S or EtsSi-H optionally in presence of an acid or Lewis acid such as e.g. TFA or BFj'OEtj. Alternatively the transformation to the alkoxycarbonylethyl-group may be carried out by 1,2-elimination (e.g. promoted by treatment with TfjO in presence of a base such as DIPEA) and subsequent hydrogenation of the alkene intermediate. Such an alkene intermediate may also be prepared directly starting from the-formyl-derivative using Wittig-, Wittig-Horner-, Wadsworth-Emmons-, or Peterson-type olefinations. Procedures for such olefinations are found in large numbers in literature and are commonly known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Prior to the derivatizations of the functional group on R6, sensitive functional groups 3a/b may be suitably protected (e.g. silylation of a hydroxy group) and deprotected again when desired or required (as described e.g. in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, 2nd Ed., 1991, Wiley N.Y.).<br>
The conversion of a compound of formula (I) into a pharmaceutically acceptable salt can be carried out by treatment of such a compound with an inorganic acid, for example a hydrohalic acid, such as, for example, hydrochloric acid or hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid etc., or with an organic acid, such as, for example, acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulfonic acid or p-toluenesulfonic acid. The corresponding carboxylate salts can also be prepared from the compounds of formula (I) by treatment with physiologically compatible bases.<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula (I) into pharmaceutically acceptable esters can be carried out e.g. by treatment of suited amino or hydroxy groups present in the molecules with an carboxylic acid such as acetic acid, with a condensating reagent such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) or N,N-dicylohexylcarbodiimide (DCCI).to produce the carboxylic ester or carboxylic amide.<br>
Insofar as their preparation is not described in the examples, the compounds of formula (I) as well as all intermediate products can be prepared according to analogous methods or according to the methods set forth above. Starting materials are commercially available or known in the art.<br>
As described above, the novel compounds of the present invention have been found to bind to and selectively activate LXR alpha and LXR beta or coactivate LXR alpha and LXR beta. Consequently, cholesterol absorption is reduced, HDL cholesterol is increased, and inflammatory atherosclerosis is reduced.

The invention therefore also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound as defined above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and/or adjuvant.<br>
The invention likewise embraces compounds as described above for use as therapeutically active substances, especially as therapeutically active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly as therapeutically active substances for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the invention relates to a method for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease, which method comprises administering a compound as defined above to a human being or animal.<br>
The invention also embraces the use of compounds as defined above for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or DCR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The invention also relates to the use of compounds as described above for the preparation of medicaments for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of diseases which are modulated by LXR alpha and/or LXR beta agonists, particularly for the therapeutic and/or prophylactic treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, low HDL-cholesterol, high LDL-cholesterol, atherosclerotic diseases, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, sepsis, inflammatory diseases, skin diseases, colitis, pancreatitis, cholestasis of the liver, fibrosis of the liver, macular degeneration and/or Alzheimer's disease. Such medicaments comprise a compound as described above.<br>
Prevention and/or treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, atherosclerotic diseases, dyslipidemia, or diabetes is the preferred indication, particularly prevention and/or treatment of increased lipid levels, increased cholesterol levels, atherosclerotic diseases, or dyslipidemia, especially prevention and/or treatment of atherosclerotic diseases or dyslipidemia.<br>
The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the compounds of the present invention. Background information on the performed assays can be found in: Nichols JS et al. "Development of a scintillation proximity assay for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma ligand binding domain", Anal Biochem. 1998,257:112-119.<br>
Mammalian expression vectors were constructed to express full-length human LXR alpha and LXR beta. Bacterial expression vectors were constructed to produce glutathione-s-transferase (GST) fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of human LXR alpha (aa 164 to 447) and human LXR beta (aa 155 to 460). To accomplish this, the portions of the sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis (Willy et al., Genes Dev. 1995,9:1033-45; Song et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.1994, 91:10809-13).<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in E. coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Refi Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et al).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
LXR alpha and LXR beta receptor binding were assayed in buffer consisting of 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4,10 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2. For each 96-well reaction, 500 ng of GST-LXRa-LBD or 700 ng of GST-LXR beta-LBD fusion proteins were bound to 80 ^g or 40 μg SPA beads (Pharmacia Amersham) respectively, in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for 1 h at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300 X g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed, and the semi-dry pellet containing the receptor-coated beads was re-suspended in 50 pi of buffer. Radioligand (eg. 100,000 dpm of (N-(2&gt;2,2-trifluoroethyl)-N-[4-(2,2,2-trifluoro-l-hydroxy-l-trifluoromethylethyl)-phenyl]-benzenesulfonamide)) was added, and the reaction incubated at RT for 1 h in the presence of test compounds, and then scintillation proximity counting was performed. All binding assays were performed in 96-well plates and the amount of bound ligand was measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard). Dose response curves were measured within a range of concentration from 10 MtolO'4M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21 ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%O2:5%CO2 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6-well<br>
plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then batch-transfected with either the full-length-LXRa or fuU-length-LXRf3 expression plasmids plus a reporter plasmid expressing luceriferase under the control of LXR response elements. Transfe-ction was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10* cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 uj of phenol red-free medium containing'the test substances or control ligands (final DMSO concentration: 0.1%). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was discarded and then 50 \il of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was added to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence, as a measure of luciferase activity, was detected in a Packard TopCount. Transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-change in luminescence compared to that of cells incubated in the absence of the substance. ECso values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The compounds according to formula (I) have an activity in at least one of the above assays (ECSO or IC50) of 1 nM to 100 \M, preferably 1 nM to 10 uM, more preferably 1 nM to 1 uM.<br>
For example, the following compounds showed the following IC50 values in the binding assay:<br>
LXRalpha Binding	. LXRbeta Binding<br>
IC50 [umoiyi]	IC50 [umol/1]<br>
0.046	0.031<br>
18	0.017	0.0034<br>
30	0.0027	0.0057<br>
These results have been obtained by using the foregoing test.<br>
The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragfes, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, drage"es and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 1 to 1000 mg, especially<br><br>
about 1 to 300 mg, comes into consideration. Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the compound could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1 to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg, preferably 1-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
