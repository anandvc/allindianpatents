				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF A NITRO-GROUP BASED TOPICAL FORMULATION FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE PERIPHERAL MICROVASCULAR DISEASES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a nitro-group based topical formulation for treatment of cold injuries and other peripheral vascular diseases. The present invention also relates to a nitro-group based topical formulation for treatment of cold injuries and other peripheral vascular diseases. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nitro group based topical formulation for the treatment of cold injuries and other peripheral vascular diseases such as those afflicting microvasculature or microcirculation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Vasospastic/vasodestructive or ischemic disorders of limbs are very common. These are found even in apparently normal individuals, and generally occur due to transient or permanent reduction of blood supply and oxygen at tissue level. Such disorders occur more frequently and severely in cold injuries, diabetes mellitus, Berger's disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, burns, arteritis of all types and other such diseases coming under the broad category of peripheral vascular diseases, particularly involving microcirculation or microvasculature. Hypovolemia, atherosclerosis, anemia and old age are further risk factors. Thrombosis in microvasculature of hands or feet causes additional complications, leading to further reduction in blood and oxygen supply and permanent damage of the tissues.<br>
Such disorders can lead to tissue death, gangrene and loss of limb or function. Such conditions are further aggravated in cold weather, particularly at high altitude and in old individuals and those who consume tobacco products or are exposed to second hand effects of tobacco products. Another related problem or complication is that local ischemia leads to development of infection and inflammation that further causes more local ischemia resulting in a vicious cycle. These peripheral vascular diseases could be of different pathological origins, namely autoimmune, infective, environmental, toxic, autonomic, vascular, idiopathic and of other and unknown origins.<br>
The disorders as described above lead to acute pain, cyanosis and loss of work efficiency (particularly of arms and legs, hands and fingers, feet and toes or facial parts) leading to edema and ulcer formation, leading to muscle and bone death, deep-seated infection, amputation and ultimately loss of the affected body organ. Even when the local blood and oxygen supply is partially restored by conventional treatment, the tissue injury aggravates  due to oxidative mechanisms.  Barring very mild  injuries,  the  damage  at<br><br>
microvascular or micro-circulation level is permanent and may be progressive. Most of the predisposing or precipitating factors are either accidental or unpreventable.<br>
It is known in the art to treat peripheral vascular diseases, particularly cold injuries in a non-pharmacological manner such as by slow re-warming of the affected part in water, called thawing. A practical limitation with of the above method is that this cannot be used as a preventive routinely but can only be used as to manage the condition. Another drawback is that it is neither practical nor possible to use thawing as the main course of treatment in field conditions. Another limitation of the slow re-warming is that the method is useful only for cold injuries and not other forms of peripheral vasospastic/ ischemic diseases. Even in cold injuries, thawing is useful for only mild cold injuries and is inadequate in major cold injuries such as frostbite. Thawing is also a very slow method of treatment and does not provide speedy relief<br>
Various pharmacological methods are also known in the art for treatment of ischemic or vasospastic/vasodestructive disorders. Such pharmacological methods include systemic methods such as oral, intramuscular or intravenous administration of vasodilator drugs.<br>
However, such pharmacological methods suffer from several limitations. A major limitation of the above method is that there is disagreement about its benefit in treating local micro-vascular conditions (mostly of arms and legs or hands and feet). This is primarily due to the inability of the systemic route to deliver sufficient quantity of medication to the peripheral ischemic lesion because of large volume of distribution. One of the most potent and fast-acting vasodilators, nitroglycerine or amylnitrate, if given by systemic route for local action on the aforesaid lesions, would result in very high pharmacological dose in the blood and is therefore impractical.<br>
Another significant disadvantage of pharmacological methods are that there may not be any benefit at all if blood supply to the hand/foot is already blocked significantly due to thrombosis. Additionally, the dosage required for systemic route is high and can cause serious side effects such as low blood pressure and significant palpitation and heart problems. This limits the duration of treatment to a few days, thereby limiting the benefits of such treatment, if any. Thus, this route cannot deliver potent and fast-acting vasodilators such as nitroglycerine, even though these would be quite effective for lesion treatment. This method also results in high treatment cost due to the high dosages required for managing the disease.<br>
Another method known in the art for management of the above diseases comprise systemic administration of anti-coagulants and/or thrombolytic agents. However, similar to systemic administration of vasodilators, the above method of management has the drawback<br>
that it requires a very high dosage thereby increasing side effects (bleeding from unrelated sites) and cost. The use of anti-coagulants and thrombolytic drugs are also considered dangerous except in hospital conditions. Another drawback is that these agents cannot be used in chronic or recurring conditions. Their use at present is therefore limited to very severe cases considering the risks involved.<br>
Another method known in the art for management of the above diseases is systemic administration of antiplatelet drugs Uke dipyridamole or aspirin. Similar to systemic administration of vasodilators, the above method of management has the drawback that it requires a very high dosage thereby increasing side effects and cost. Another drawback of the above method is that the pharmacological effect of such drugs is limited if the local blood circulation is compromised due to thrombosis.<br>
It is also known in the art to manage the above diseases using oral pentoxyphyllin or other Xanthine-based drugs or Dextran infusion that are known to reduce blood viscosity, thus enabling more flow of blood to the lesions. However, the above method, like systemic vasodilators and antiplatelet drugs, has the drawback that a very high blood concentration is required for optimal concentration in the peripheral lesions, thus increasing side effects and cost. Also, it may have limited pharmacological effect if local blood circulation is compromised due to thrombosis.<br>
Topical ointments containing analgesics and antibiotics are available but have the drawback that these are useful in controlling only the infection and do not address the main problem of microvascular insufficiency. Topical ointments containing nicotinic acid as a vasodilator (for example, 'ThrombophobeTM) are available in the market for treating microvascular insufficiency. Their main drawback is that though useful, these are usually not found sufficiently potent to cure the conditions by themselves and are only used for supportive treatment.<br>
As such, there is need of a topical ointment which could penetrate effectively through the skin to deliver fast-acting and potent drugs that act on legal microvasculature and increase the local blood flow through vasodilation and other effects, OBJECTS OF THE EVVENTION<br>

The invention will now be illustrated with a working example, which is intending to be an illustrate example, and is not intending to be taken restrictively to imply any limitation on the scope of the present invention. WORKING EXAMPLE<br>
2.5 gram cetomacrogol 1000, 5 gram cetostearyl alcohol and 18 gram white soft paraffin are melted on water bath in the decreasing order of their melting points. 100 mg propyl paraben is added to 10 gram liquid paraffin and it was heated till it dissolved. Next, the above two mix are mixed together. Next, 200 mg PEG 400 is added in 75 gram water and heated on water bath. The oil phase and water phase are heated to 60°C. The aqueous phase is poured in oil phase with continuous stirring. After cooling it to 35°C, 100 mg nitroglycerine and 100 mg glycerin and perfiime are added. CLINICAL EVALUATION:<br>
Vasodilator action of the nitroglycerine/amylnitrite based multicomponent medicated ointment was tested using nuclear medicine technology in 8 healthy volunteers.   Digital<br>
angiographic and / or blood-pool images of the hands and / or feet were taken after injecting a radiopharmaceutical on a Gamma or SPECT Camera. After applying the 2 gram of medicated ointment on the surface of one hand / feet and gently rubbing to spread it completely, the nuclear vascularity of the part has increased following the ointment application and at what interval. Typically, the imaging protocol was repeated before and after 1-3 days of application (two times a day) to evaluate the benefit qualitatively and quantitatively. All eight individuals showed more than 15% rise in circulation within 6 hrs of apphcation and more than 60% (60-110%)) increases in blood flow in the part of apphcation within 489 hrs of the topical application. All patients developed feeling of warmth over the part applied to. Few on these developed redness also. There were no side effects noted in any of the patients.<br>
Phase 1-2 field trial at high altitude in more than 15 patient volunteers has shown reduction in pain &amp; numbness and increase in feeling of warmth &amp; skin temperature by 0.5-2°C following topical application. No local or systemic side effects have been observed.<br>
