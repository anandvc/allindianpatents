				<td>A METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR FORMING<br>
A COATING ON A POWDERED SUBSTRATE<br>
[0001] The present application describes a process for coating powdered particles<br>
using atmospheric pressure plasma techniques.<br>
[0002] When matter is continually supplied with energy, its temperature increases and it<br>
typically transforms from a solid to a liquid and, then, to a gaseous state. Continuing to supply<br>
energy causes the system to undergo yet a further change of state in which neutral atoms or<br>
molecules of the gas are broken up by energetic collisions to produce negatively charged<br>
electrons, positive or negatively charged ions and other species. This mix of charged particles<br>
exhibiting collective behaviour is called "plasma", the fourth state of matter. Due to their<br>
electrical charge, plasmas are highly influenced by external electromagnetic fields, which make<br>
them readily controllable. Furthermore, their high energy content allows them to achieve<br>
processes which are impossible or difficult through the other states of matter, such as by liquid<br>
or gas processing.<br>
[0003] The term "plasma" covers a huge range of systems whose density and<br>
temperature vary by many orders of magnitude. Some plasmas are very hot and all their<br>
microscopic species (ions, electrons, etc.) are in approximate thermal equilibrium, the energy<br>
input into the system being widely distributed through atomic/molecular level collisions. Other<br>
plasmas, however, particular those at low pressure (e.g. 100 Pa) where collisions are relatively<br>
infrequent, have their constituent species at widely different temperatures and are called "non-<br>
thermal equilibrium" plasmas. In these non-thermal plasmas the free electrons are very hot with<br>
temperatures of many thousands of Kelvin (K) whilst the neutral and ionic species remain cool.<br>
Because the free electrons have almost negligible mass, the total system heat content is low and<br>
the plasma operates close to room temperature thus allowing the processing of temperature<br>
sensitive materials, such as plastics or polymers, without imposing a damaging thermal burden.<br>
The hot electrons create, through high energy collisions, a rich source of radicals and excited<br>
species with a high chemical potential energy capable of profound chemical and physical<br>
reactivity. It is this combination of low temperature operation plus high reactivity which makes<br>
non-thermal plasma technologically important and a very powerful tool for manufacturing and<br><br>
material processing as it is capable of achieving processes which, if achievable at all without<br>
plasma, would require very high temperatures or noxious and aggressive chemicals.<br>
[0004J For industrial applications of plasma technology, a convenient method is to<br>
couple electromagnetic power into a volume of process gas, which can be mixtures of gases and<br>
vapours in which the workpieces/samples to be treated are immersed or passed through. The<br>
gas becomes ionised into plasma, generating chemical radicals, UV-radiation, and ions, which<br>
react with the surface of the samples. By correct selection of process gas composition, driving<br>
power frequency, power coupling mode, pressure and other control parameters, the plasma<br>
process can be tailored to the specific application required by a manufacturer.<br>
[0005] Because of the huge chemical and thermal range of plasmas, they are suitable for<br>
many technological applications. Non-thermal equilibrium plasmas are particularly effective for<br>
surface activation, surface cleaning, material etching and coating of surfaces.<br>
[0006] A plasma technology that is rapidly emerging into mainstream industry is that of<br>
plasma coating/thin film deposition. Typically, a high level of polymerisation is achieved by<br>
application of plasma to monomeric gases and vapours. Thus, a dense, tightly knit and three-<br>
dimensionally connected film can be formed which is thermally stable, chemically very resistant<br>
and mechanically robust. Such films are deposited conformally on even the most intricate of<br>
surfaces and at a temperature, which ensures a low thermal burden on the powdered substrate.<br>
Plasmas are therefore ideal for the coating of delicate and heat sensitive, as well as robust<br>
materials. Plasma coatings are free of micropores even with thin layers. The optical properties,<br>
e.g. colour, of the coating can often be customised and plasma coatings adhere well to even non-<br>
polar materials, e.g. polyethylene, as well as steel (e.g. anti-corrosion films on metal reflectors),<br>
ceramics, semiconductors, textiles, etc.<br>
[0007] Plasma engineering produces a surface effect customised to the desired<br>
application or product without affecting the material bulk in any way. Plasma processing thus<br>
offers the manufacturer a versatile and powerful tool allowing choice of a material for its bulk<br>
technical and commercial properties while giving the freedom to independently engineer its<br>
surface to meet a totally different set of needs and confers greatly enhanced product<br>
functionality, performance, lifetime and quality which provides the user a significant added<br>
value to its production capability.<br>
[0008] These properties provide a strong motivation for industry to adopt plasma-based<br>
processing, and this move has been led since the 1960s by the microelectronics community<br>
which has developed the low pressure Glow Discharge plasma into an ultra-high technology and<br>
high capital cost engineering tool for semiconductor, metal and dielectric processing. The same<br>
low pressure Glow Discharge type plasma has increasingly penetrated other industrial sectors<br>
since the 1980s offering, at more moderate cost, processes such as polymer surface activation<br>
for increased adhesion/bond strength, high quality degreasing/cleaning and the deposition of<br>
high performance coatings. Thus, there has been a substantial take-up of plasma technology.<br>
Glow discharges can be achieved at both vacuum and atmospheric pressures. In the case of<br>
atmospheric pressure glow discharge, gases such as helium or argon are utilised as diluents<br>
and a high frequency (e.g.&gt; 1kHz) power supply is used to generate a homogeneous glow<br>
discharge at atmospheric pressure via a Penning ionisation mechanism, (see for example,<br>
Kanazawa et al, J.Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1988, 21, 838, Okazaki et al, Proc. Jpn. Symp. Plasma<br>
Chem. 1989, 2, 95, Kanazawa et al, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physical Research<br>
1989, B37/38, 842, and Yokoyama et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1990, 23, 374).<br>
[0009] However, adoption of plasma technology has been limited by a major constraint<br>
on most industrial plasma systems, namely, their need to operate at low pressure. Partial<br>
vacuum operation means a closed perimeter, sealed reactor system providing only off-line,<br>
batch processing of discrete work pieces. Throughput is low or moderate and the need for<br>
vacuum adds capital and running costs.<br>
[0010] Atmospheric pressure plasmas, however, offer industry open port or perimeter<br>
systems providing free ingress into and exit from the plasma region by workpieces/webs and,<br>
hence, on-line, continuous processing of large or small area webs or conveyor-carried discrete<br>
webs. Throughput is high, reinforced by the high species flux obtained from high pressure<br>
operation. Many industrial sectors, such as textiles, packaging, paper, medical, automotive,<br>
aerospace, etc., rely almost entirely upon continuous, on-line processing so that open<br>
port/perimeter configuration plasmas at atmospheric pressure offer a new industrial processing<br>
capability.<br>
[0011] Corona and flame (also a plasma) treatment systems have provided industry with<br>
a limited form of atmospheric pressure plasma processing capability for about 30 years.<br>
However, despite their high manufacturability, these systems have failed to penetrate the market<br>
or be taken up by industry to anything like the same extent as the lower pressure, bath-<br>
processing-only plasma type. The reason is that corona/flame systems have significant<br>
limitations. They operate in ambient air offering a single surface activation process and have a<br>
negligible effect on many materials and a weak effect on most. The treatment is often non-<br>
uniform and the corona process is incompatible with thick webs or 3D webs while the flame<br>
process is incompatible with heat sensitive powdered substrates.<br>
[0012] Significant advances have been made in plasma deposition at atmospheric<br>
pressure. Considerable work has been done on the stabilisation of atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharges, such as described in Okazaki et al. J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 26 (1993) 889-892.<br>
Further, US Patent Specification No. 5414324 describes the generation of a steady-state glow<br>
discharge plasma at atmospheric pressure between a pair of electrically insulated metal plate<br>
electrodes spaced up to 5 cm apart and radio frequency (RF) energised with a root means<br>
square (rms) potential of 1 to 5 kV at 1 to 100 kHz.<br>
[0013] The treatment of powdered substrates using atmospheric pressure plasma has<br>
been previously described. In JP 06-000365 there is provided an apparatus for continuously<br>
plasma treating a powdered substrate by coaxially pivoting a metallic inner and outer<br>
cylinders at least one side of the outer cylinder being coated with a dielectric to form a fixed<br>
gap between the cylinders, inclining the cylinders and passing a voltage across the electrodes<br>
to effect the atmospheric pressure plasma treatment of a powdered substrate. In JP 06-<br>
228739 there is provided a means for surface treating a powdered substrate by atmospheric-<br>
pressure glow discharge by gas floating the powdered substrate with a rare gas or mixture of a<br>
rare gas and a gaseous reactant. The treatment occurs in a substantially cylindrical vertical<br>
positioned reaction vessel at the bottom of which gas is introduced to float the powdered<br>
substrate and the exit is out of the top of the vessel carried by the gas having been first<br>
subjected to and atmospheric-pressure glow discharge at a pressure higher than atmospheric<br>
pressure. In US5399832 there is provided a method for treating and/or coating an organic or<br>
inorganic powdered substrate using an organic monomer using atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharge. In WO 97/29156 there is provided a method of treating deagglomerated particles<br>
with plasma activated gas to modify the surface of the particles and species.<br>
[0014] All of the aforementioned prior art relate to the activation of the powdered<br>
substrate or applications of coatings using gas phase precursors and typically the results<br>
suggest low deposition rates and require high residence times to obtain a sufficiently coated<br>
surface.<br>
[0015] In accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention there is<br>
provided a method of forming a coating on a powdered substrate, which method comprises<br>
introducing an atomised liquid and/or solid coating forming material and separately<br>
transporting a powdered substrate to be coated into an atmospheric plasma discharge and/or<br>
an ionised gas stream resulting therefrom, and exposing the powdered substrate to the<br>
atomised liquid and/or solid coating forming material.<br>
[0016] For the purposes of this application a powdered substrate should be considered<br>
as a solid material in the form of spherical particles, platelets, needles/tubes, flakes, dust,<br>
granulates and any aggregates of the aforementioned forms. The powdered substrate may be<br>
transported relative to the plasma region, i.e. the region wherein it is treated by an<br>
atmospheric plasma discharge and/or an ionised gas stream resulting therefrom by any<br>
suitable means, for example it may be merely dropped under gravity through the plasma zone<br>
or may be transported therethrough on a support or the like for example it may be transported<br>
through the plasma zone in the form of a fluidised bed, on a conveying means such as on a<br>
reel to reel support, conveyor belt or vibrating conveyor. Alternatively the powdered<br>
substrate may be entrained on a carrier gas or transported in a vortex or dual cyclone type<br>
apparatus, in which case the powder to be treated may be fed in from either the top or bottom<br>
of the plasma chamber. The powder may also be suspended in a fluid bed arrangement within<br>
the plasma chamber. In the case of a reel-to-reel web support, the powdered substrate may be<br>
first placed on a web of material and then a second covering applied and the edges of the two<br>
webs are sealed together to prevent loss of powdered substrate from the web. Alternatively<br>
the powdered substrate may be maintained stationary in a suitable receptacle, in which case,<br>
the plasma unit generating the atmospheric plasma discharge and/or an ionised gas stream is<br>
moved relative to the receptacle. Whichever means of transportation is utilised it is preferred<br>
that the exposure time in which powdered substrate is retained within the atmospheric plasma<br>
discharge and/or an ionised gas stream is constant in order to ensure an even treatment<br>
throughout the powdered substrate being treated.<br>
[0017] The liquid and/or solid coating forming material is preferably introduced into the<br>
plasma apparatus by way of a liquid and/or solid spray through an atomiser or nebuliser as<br>
described in the applicants co-pending application WO 02/28548, which was published after the<br>
priority date of this application.<br>
[0018] The coating-forming material may be atomised using any conventional means,<br>
for example an ultrasonic nozzle. The atomiser preferably produces a coating-forming<br>
material drop size of from 10 to 100µm, more preferably from 10 to 50p.m. Suitable<br>
atomisers for use in the method in accordance with the present invention are ultrasonic<br>
nozzles from Sono-Tek Corporation, Milton, New York, USA or Lechler GmbH of<br>
Metzingen Germany. The apparatus which may be utilised in the method in accordance with<br>
the present invention may include a plurality of atomisers, which may be of particular utility,<br>
for example, where the apparatus is to be used to form a copolymer coating on a powdered<br>
substrate from two different coating-forming materials, where the monomers are immiscible<br>
or are in different phases, e.g. the first is a solid and the second is gaseous or liquid.<br>
[00191 Any conventional means for generating an atmospheric pressure plasma glow<br>
discharge may be used in the method of the present invention, for example atmospheric<br>
pressure plasma jet, atmospheric pressure microwave glow discharge and atmospheric<br>
pressure glow discharge. Typically, such means will employ a helium diluents and a high<br>
frequency (e.g&gt; 1kHz) power supply to generate a homogeneous glow discharge at<br>
atmospheric pressure via a Penning ionisation mechanism, (see for example, Kanazawa et al,<br>
J.Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1988, 21, 838, Okazaki et al, Proc. Jpn. Symp. Plasma Chem. 1989, 2,<br>
95, Kanazawa et al, Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physical Research 1989, B37/38,<br>
842, and Yokoyama et al., J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 1990, 23, 374).<br>
[0020] For typical plasma generating apparatus, the plasma is generated within a gap<br>
of from 3 to 50mm, for example 5 to 25mm. The generation of steady-state glow discharge<br>
plasma at atmospheric pressure is preferably obtained between adjacent electrodes which may<br>
be spaced up to 5 cm apart, dependent on the process gas used. The electrodes being radio<br>
frequency energised with a root mean square (rms) potential of 1 to 100 kV, preferably<br>
between 1 and 30 kV at 1 to 100 kHz, preferably at 15 to 50 kHz. The voltage used to form<br>
the plasma will typically be between 1 and 30 kV, most preferably between 2.5 and 10 kV<br>
however the actual value will depend on the chemistry/gas choice and plasma region size<br>
between the electrodes. Whilst the atmospheric pressure glow discharge assembly may<br>
operate at any suitable temperature, it preferably will operate at a temperature between room<br>
temperature (20° C) and 70° C and is typically utilized at a temperature in the region of 30 to<br>
50° C.<br>
[0021] The process gas for use in plasma treatment method in accordance with the<br>
present invention may be any suitable gas but is preferably an inert gas or inert gas based<br>
mixture such as, for example helium, a mixture of helium and argon and an argon based<br>
mixture additionally containing ketones and/or related compounds. These process gases may<br>
be utilized alone or in combination with potentially reactive gases such as, for example,<br>
nitrogen, ammonia, O2, H2O, NO2, air or hydrogen. Most preferably, the process gas will be<br>
Helium alone or in combination with an oxidizing or reducing gas. The selection of gas<br>
depends upon the plasma processes to be undertaken. When an oxidizing or reducing process<br>
gas is required, it will preferably be utilized in a mixture comprising 90 - 99% noble gas and<br>
1 to 10% oxidizing or reducing gas.<br>
[0022] Under oxidising conditions, the present method may be used to form an<br>
oxygen containing coating on the powdered substrate. For example, silica-based coatings can<br>
be formed on the powdered substrate surface from atomised silicon-containing coating-<br>
forming materials. Under reducing conditions, the present method may be used to form<br>
oxygen free coatings, for example, silicon carbide based coatings may be formed from<br>
atomised silicon containing coating forming materials.<br>
[0023] In a nitrogen containing gaseous atmosphere nitrogen atoms or molecules can<br>
bind to the powdered substrate surface, and in an atmosphere containing both nitrogen and<br>
oxygen, nitrates can bind to and/or form on the powdered substrate surface. Such gases may<br>
also be used to pre-treat the powdered substrate surface before exposure to a coating forming<br>
substance. For example, oxygen containing plasma treatment of the powdered substrate may<br>
provide improved adhesion with the applied coating. The oxygen containing plasma being<br>
generated by introducing oxygen containing materials to the plasma such as oxygen gas or<br>
water.<br>
[0024] The Coating thickness for particles coated by the present process is l-200nm.<br>
Typically the process gas used is helium.<br>
[0025] By introducing coating forming material directly to an atmospheric plasma<br>
process that higher deposition rates of coating onto powdered substrate particles may be<br>
achieved. The use of direct injection of coating forming material also provides for the use of<br>
a wider range of precursor materials, and the coating process is not restricted to gas phase<br>
materials or high vapour pressure liquids<br>
[0026] Whilst the powdered substrate may be only subjected to the coating step in<br>
accordance with the present invention, it may also be may be pre or post treated with any<br>
appropriate plasma treatment. Typically, in the case of powdered substrates, the most likely are<br>
pre-treatments where the powdered substrate surface is cleaned and/or surface activated before<br>
coating. Post treatment is likely to involve the application of further coatings. For example, a<br>
coating formed on a powdered substrate may be post treated in a range of plasma conditions.<br>
For example, siloxane derived coatings may be further oxidised by oxygen containing plasma<br>
treatments. The oxygen containing plasma being generated by introducing oxygen containing<br>
materials to the plasma such as oxygen gas or water.<br>
[0027] Any appropriate combination of plasma treatments may be used, for example the<br>
powdered substrate may be passed through a first plasma region to clean and/or activate the<br>
surface of the powdered substrate by plasma treating using a helium gas plasma and then<br>
through a second plasma region utilised to apply a coating, for example, by application of a<br>
liquid and/or solid spray through an atomiser or nebuliser as described in the applicants co-<br>
pending application WO 02/28548, which was published after the priority date of this<br>
application.<br>
[0028] The present invention further provides apparatus for forming a coating on a<br>
powdered substrate, which apparatus comprises means for generating an atmospheric pressure<br>
plasma discharge within which, in use, the powdered substrate to be coated is introduced, an<br>
atomiser for providing an atomised coating-forming material within the plasma discharge,<br>
and means for supplying a coating forming material to the atomiser.<br>
[0029] The plasma chamber may be orientated vertically, allowing gravity fed<br>
processing. For example, if atmospheric pressure glow discharge is employed, using either<br>
flat, parallel electrodes, or concentric parallel electrodes, the electrodes may be orientated<br>
vertically. In this case, powdered substrate to be treated is introduced at the top of the plasma<br>
chamber and passes through the plasma region, where atomised coating forming material is<br>
introduced. Polymerisation and crosslinking reactions occur within the plasma region to<br>
produce powdered substrate particles with well adhered coatings. The coated powdered<br>
substrate particles then exit the chamber at the base. Alternatively, atomised liquid and/or<br>
solid coating forming material may be introduced into the top of the plasma chamber and<br>
polymer particles are formed within the chamber and collected at the base. In both cases,<br>
particle flow can be controlled and enhanced by the flow of plasma process gas through the<br>
chamber.<br>
[0030] In an alternative embodiment the atmospheric pressure plasma assembly<br>
utilised in the method of the present invention may comprise a first and second pair of<br>
vertically or horizontally arrayed, parallel spaced-apart planar electrodes with at least one<br>
dielectric plate between said first pair, adjacent one electrode and at least one dielectric plate<br>
between said second pair adjacent one electrode, the spacing between the dielectric plate and the<br>
other dielectric plate or electrode of each of the first and second pairs of electrodes forming a<br>
first and second plasma region. In this instance, the assembly also comprises a means of<br>
transporting a powdered substrate successively through said first and second plasma regions.<br>
Most preferably, the electrodes are vertically arrayed.<br>
[0031] One means of transporting the powdered substrate may be by a reel to reel based<br>
process when the electrodes are vertically arrayed, when horizontally arrayed the means of<br>
transport may be any of those described earlier such as on a reel to reel web or conveyor belt.<br>
[0032] For vertically arrayed electrodes the powdered substrate may be transported<br>
through the first plasma region in an upwardly or downwardly direction. Preferably when the<br>
powdered substrate passes through one plasma zone in an upwardly direction and the other in a<br>
downwardly direction one or more guide rollers are provided to guide the powdered substrate<br>
from the end of the first reel into the first plasma zone, from the first plasma zone to and into the<br>
second plasma zone and from the second plasma zone to the second reel or next plasma zone<br>
dependent on the number of plasma zones being used. The powdered substrate residence time<br>
in each plasma region may be predetermined prior to coating and rather than varying the<br>
speed of the powdered substrate, through each plasma zone, the path length a powdered<br>
substrate has to travel through each plasma region may be altered such that the powdered<br>
substrate may pass through both regions at the same speed but may spend a different period of<br>
time in each plasma region due to differing path lengths through the respective plasma<br>
regions.<br>
[0033] In the case when the electrodes utilised in the present invention are vertically<br>
orientated, it is preferred that a powdered substrate be transported through an atmospheric<br>
pressure plasma assembly upwardly through one plasma region and downwardly though the<br>
other plasma region.<br>
[0034] Preferably each powdered substrate needs only to be subjected to one pass<br>
through the assembly but if required the powdered substrate may be returned to the first reel<br>
for further passages through the assembly.<br>
[0035] Additional pairs of electrodes may be added to the system to form further<br>
successive plasma regions through which a powdered substrate would pass. The additional<br>
pairs of electrodes may be situated before or after said first and second pair of electrodes such<br>
that powdered substrate would be subjected to pre-treatment or post-treatment steps. Said<br>
additional pairs of electrodes are preferably situated before or after and most preferably after<br>
said first and second pairs of electrodes. Treatments applied in the plasma regions formed by<br>
the additional pairs of electrodes may be the same or different from that undertaken in the first<br>
and second plasma regions. In the case when additional plasma regions are provided for pre-<br>
treatment or post-treatment, the necessary number of guides and/or rollers will be provided in<br>
order to ensure the passage of the powdered substrate through the assembly. Similarly<br>
preferably the powdered substrate will be transported alternatively upwardly and downwardly<br>
through all neighbouring plasma regions in the assembly.<br>
[0036] Each electrode may comprise any suitable geometry and construction. Metal<br>
electrodes may be used and may be in, for example, the form of metallic plates or a mesh. The<br>
metal electrodes may be bonded to the dielectric material either by adhesive or by some<br>
application of heat and fusion of the metal of the electrode to the dielectric material.<br>
Alternatively one or more of the electrodes may be encapsulated within the dielectric material or<br>
may be in the form of a dielectric material with a metallic coating such as, for example a<br>
dielectric, preferably a glass dielectric with a sputtered metallic coating.<br>
[0037] In one embodiment of the invention each electrode is of the type described in<br>
the applicants co-pending application WO 02/35576 which was published after the priority<br>
date of the present invention wherein there are provided electrode units containing an<br>
electrode and an adjacent a dielectric plate and a cooling liquid distribution system for<br>
directing a cooling conductive liquid onto the exterior of the electrode to cover a planar face<br>
of the electrode. Each electrode unit may comprise a watertight box having a side formed by<br>
a dielectric plate having bonded thereto on the interior of the box the planar electrode together<br>
with a liquid inlet and a liquid outlet. The liquid distribution system may comprise a cooler<br>
and a recirculation pump and/or a sparge pipe incorporating spray nozzles.<br>
[0038] Ideally the cooling liquid covers the face of the electrode remote<br>
from dielectric plate. The cooling conductive liquid is preferably water and may<br>
contain conductivity controlling compounds such as metal salts or soluble<br>
organic additives. Ideally, the electrode is a metal electrode in contact with<br>
dielectric plate. In one embodiment, there is a pair of metal efficient cooling<br>
agent also assists in providing an efficient electrode.<br>
[0039] The dielectric materials may be made from any suitable dielectric,<br>
examples include but are not restricted to polycarbonate, polyethylene, glass,<br>
glass laminates, epoxy filled glass laminates and the like.<br>
[0040] The method in accordance with the present invention is particularly<br>
suited for coating powdered substrates which are sensitive to other coating<br>
processes and are particularly useful for coating powdered substrates which are<br>
sensitive to, for example, heat, temperature and UV light. The powdered<br>
substrates to be coated include biologically active ingredients such as enzymes,<br>
proteins, DNA/RNA and pharmaceutically active agents such as any of the<br>
following: anti-acne agent, antibiotic, antiseptic, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial, anti-<br>
microbial, biocides, anti-inflammatory, hyluronic acid containing materials,<br>
astringents, hormones, anti-cancer agents, smoking cessation compositions,<br>
cardiovascular, histamine blocker, bronchodilator, analgesic, anti-arrythmic, anti-<br>
histamine, alpha-l blocker, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, diuretic, anti-aggregant,<br>
sedative, tranquilizer, anti-convulsant, anti-coagulant agents, vitamins, anti-<br>
"aging agents, agents for treating gastric and duodenal ulcers, anti-cellulites.<br>
[0041] It is to be understood that the forming material in accordance with<br>
the present invention is a precursor material which can be used to make any<br>
appropriate coating, including for example, a material which can be used to grow<br>
a film or to chemically modify an existing surface. The present invention may be<br>
used to form many different types of coatings. The type of coating which is<br>
formed on the powdered substrate is determined by the coating-forming material<br>
(s) used, and the present method may be used to (co)polymerise coating-forming<br>
monomer material(s) onto the powdered substrate surface.<br>
[0042] The coating-forming material may be organic or inorganic, solid,<br>
liquid or gaseous, or mixtures thereof, Suitable organic coating-forming materials<br>
include carboxylates, methacrylates, acrylates, styrenes, methacrylonitriles,<br>
alkenes and dienes, for example methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, propyl<br>
methacrylate, butyl methacrylate,<br>
and other alkyl methacrylates, and the corresponding acrylates, including organofunctional<br>
methacrylates and acrylates, including glycidyl methacrylate, trimethoxysilyl propyl<br>
methacrylate, allyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, hydroxypropyl methacrylate,<br>
dialkylaminoalkyl methacrylates, and fluoroalkyl (meth)acrylates, methacrylic acid, acrylic<br>
acid, flimaric acid and esters, itaconic acid (and esters), maleic anhydride, styrene, a-<br>
methylstyrene, halogenated alkenes, for example, vinyl halides, such as vinyl chlorides and<br>
vinyl fluorides, and fluorinated alkenes, for example perfluoroalkenes, acrylonitrile,<br>
methacrylonitrile, ethylene, propylene, allyl amine, vinylidene halides, butadienes,<br>
acrylamide, such as N-isopropylacrylamide, methacrylamide, epoxy compounds, for example<br>
glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane, glycidol, styrene oxide, butadiene monoxide,<br>
ethyleneglycol diglycidylether, glycidyl methacrylate, bisphenol A diglycidylether (and its<br>
oligomers), vinylcyclohexene oxide, conducting polymers such as pyrrole and thiophene and<br>
their derivatives, and phosphorus-containing compounds, for example<br>
dimethylallylphosphonate.<br>
[0043] Suitable inorganic coating-forming materials include metals and metal oxides,<br>
including colloidal metals. Organometallic compounds may also be suitable coating-forming<br>
materials, including metal alkoxides such as titanates, tin alkoxides, zirconates and alkoxides<br>
of germanium and erbium. However, the present inventors have found that the present<br>
invention has particular utility in providing powdered substrates with silica- or siloxane-based<br>
coatings using coating-forming compositions comprising silicon-containing materials.<br>
Suitable silicon-containing materials for use in the method of the present invention include<br>
silanes (for example, silane, alkylsilanes, alkylhalosilanes, alkoxysilanes) and linear (for<br>
example, polydimethylsiloxane) and cyclic siloxanes (for example,<br>
octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane), including organo-functional linear and cyclic siloxanes (for<br>
example, Si-H containing, halo-functional, and haloalkyl-functional linear and cyclic<br>
siloxanes, e.g. tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane and<br>
tri(nonofluorobutyl)trimethylcyclotrisiloxane). A mixture of different silicon-containing<br>
materials may be used, for example to tailor the physical properties of the powdered substrate<br>
coating for a specified need (e.g. thermal properties, optical properties, such as refractive<br>
index, and viscoelastic properties).<br>
[0044] In addition, under oxidising conditions the present method may be used to<br>
form an oxygen containing coating on the powdered substrate. For example, silica-based<br>
coatings can be formed on the powdered substrate surface from atomised silicon-containing<br>
coating-forming materials. Under reducing conditions, the present method may be used to<br>
form oxygen free coatings, for example, silicon carbide based coatings may be formed from<br>
atomised silicon containing coating forming materials.<br>
[0045] Plasma generating conditions containing gases other than oxygen may also be<br>
employed, for example noble gases, air, hydrogen, nitrogen and ammonia. In a nitrogen<br>
containing atmosphere nitrogen can bind to the powdered substrate surface, and in an<br>
atmosphere containing both nitrogen and oxygen, nitrates can bind to and/or form on the<br>
powdered substrate surface. Such gases may also be used to pre-treat the powdered substrate<br>
surface before exposure to the coating forming substance. For example, oxygen containing<br>
plasma treatment of the powdered substrate may provide improved adhesion with the applied<br>
coating. The oxygen containing plasma being generated by introducing oxygen containing<br>
materials to the plasma such as oxygen gas or water. Furthermore, the coating formed on the<br>
powdered substrate may be post treated in a range of plasma conditions. For example,<br>
siloxane derived coatings may be further oxidised by oxygen containing plasma treatment.<br>
The oxygen containing plasma being generated by introducing oxygen containing materials to<br>
the plasma such as oxygen gas or water.<br>
[0046] An advantage of the present invention over the prior art is that both liquid and<br>
solid atomised coating-forming materials may be used to form coatings on powdered<br>
substrates, due to the method of the present invention taking place under conditions of<br>
atmospheric pressure. Furthermore the coating-forming materials can be introduced into the<br>
plasma discharge or resulting stream in the absence of a carrier gas, i.e. they can be<br>
introduced directly by, for example, direct injection, whereby the coating forming materials<br>
are injected directly into the plasma.<br>
[0047] As mentioned above, the present inventors have found particular utility of the<br>
present invention for forming silica- and siloxane-based coatings on powdered substrates<br>
using silicon-containing materials. Under oxidising conditions, e.g. an oxygen containing<br>
atmosphere, silica-like coatings can be formed on the powdered substrate surface from<br>
atomised silicon-containing materials, whereas under non-oxidising conditions, a siloxane<br>
polymer, e.g. a linear, branched or resinous siloxane polymer, can be formed on the powdered<br>
substrate surface from atomisation of a silicon-containing monomer. A siloxane-organic<br>
copolymer can be formed on the powdered substrate surface by use of a mixture of organic<br>
and silicon-containing monomers. However, the present invention is also useful for forming<br>
an organic coating on a powdered substrate, for example a polyacrylic acid or perfluoro-<br>
organic coating.<br>
[0048] Powdered substrates coated by the method of the present invention may have<br>
various utilities. For example, a silica based coating may give encapsulation through<br>
enhanced barrier (oxygen and/or moisture) properties and controlled release properties to an<br>
organic particle such as a fragrance, flavour, pharmaceutical or dyestuff. Improved<br>
compatibility could be achieved for metal or metal oxide powders used as reinforcing or<br>
property modifying fillers in rubbers and plastics. Improved compatibility may also be<br>
utilised for dispersions such as dyestuffs/pigments, antioxidants and UV stabilisers in<br>
polymer materials and also formulated products such as paints and cosmetics. Powder<br>
processing may be improved by enhancing characteristics such as flow, compatibility and<br>
electrostatic properties. Specific functionalities may be added to catalysts and catalyst<br>
support to enhance or control reactivity. Also surface and pore properties of powders used as<br>
separation media or as support for separation media may be controlled.<br>
[0049] In one embodiment of the invention a statically electric charged porous plate<br>
or a vibrating sieve may be placed in line with the exit of the powdered substrate from the<br>
plasma region to collect the resulting powdered substrate.<br>
[0050] The present invention will now be described further on the basis of the<br>
following examples and drawings in which :-<br>
Fig. 1 shows a plan view of an embodiment of the invention where the powdered substrate is<br>
transported through the plasma region by gravity.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a plan view of an alternative embodiment by which the powdered substrate is<br>
transported through the plasma regions on a reel to reel web.<br>
Fig. 3a is the 29Si solid state NMR spectrum of uncoated rice hull ash and Fig. 3b is 29Si solid<br>
state NMR spectrum of the coated rice hull ash as described in Example 1.<br>
[0051] In a First embodiment as shown in Fig. 1 there is provided an atmospheric<br>
pressure glow discharge apparatus for powdered substrate treatment which relies upon gravity<br>
for transport of the powdered substrate through the atmospheric pressure glow discharge<br>
apparatus. The apparatus comprises a casing made of a dielectric material such as<br>
polypropylene, a pair of parallel electrodes 2, an atomiser nozzle 3 for the introduction of the<br>
coating making material, a means for powdered substrate delivery 4 and a collector for the<br>
resulting coated powdered substrate. In use, a process gas, typically helium, is introduced<br>
into top of the column and an appropriate potential difference is applied between the<br>
electrodes to affect a plasma therebetween as identified by the plasma region 6. Appropriate<br>
amounts of the powdered substrate from delivery means 4 and coating making material is<br>
introduced by way of nozzle 3. Typically the coating making material is in the form of an<br>
atomised liquid and/or solid and as such both the uncoated powdered substrate are introduced<br>
into the assembly above the plasma zone 6 and rely upon gravity to feed powdered substrate<br>
and coating forming material through the plasma region 6 with coated powdered substrate<br>
being collected in collector 7.<br>
[0052] An alternative embodiment is depicted in Fig.2 in which there is provided a<br>
flexible web which acts a support for the powdered substrate to be treated in accordance with<br>
the present invention. A means of transporting the web through the atmospheric pressure glow<br>
discharge assembly generally depicted as 20 is provided in the form of guide rollers 70,71 and<br>
72. Atmospheric pressure glow discharge assembly 20 comprises two pairs of electrodes 21,22<br>
and 23,24 respectively, which in use will generate plasma zones 25 and 60. Each electrode 21,<br>
22,23 and 24 comprises a watertight box, typically made of a dielectric material such as<br>
polypropylene. Each watertight box comprises a steel mesh electrode 26, fixed to a glass<br>
dielectric material 27 and a sparge pipe inlet 28 for spraying water on to the rear face of the<br>
mesh electrode. The assembly also comprises a process gas inlet 75, an assembly lid 76 and an<br>
ultrasonic nozzle 74 for introducing an atomised liquid into plasma region 60.<br>
(0053] In use a flexible web 68 on which is retained the powdered substrate is<br>
transported to and over guide roller 70 and is thereby guided through plasma region 25 between<br>
electrodes 21 and 22. The plasma produced in plasma region 25 may be a cleaning and/or<br>
activating helium plasma, i.e. no reactive agent is directed into plasma region 25, or<br>
alternatively region 25 may be used as a helium purge zone, i.e. the plasma in this zone is not<br>
ignited. The helium is introduced into the system by way of inlet 75. Lid 76 is placed over the<br>
top of the system to prevent the escape of helium as it is lighter than air. Upon leaving plasma<br>
region 25 the web containing the plasma cleaned powdered substrate passes over guide 71 and<br>
is directed down through plasma region 60, between electrodes 23 and 24 and over roller 72.<br>
Plasma region 60 generates a coating for the powdered substrate by means of the injection of a<br>
reactive agent in the form of a liquid coating making material through ultrasonic nozzle 74. The<br>
atomised liquid travels under gravity through plasma region 60 and is kept separate from plasma<br>
region 25 and as such, no coating occurs in plasma region 25. The powdered substrate is coated<br>
whilst being transported through plasma region 60 and then is transported over roller 72 and is<br>
collected or further treated with additional plasma treatments. Rollers 70 and 72 may be reels as<br>
opposed to rollers. Having passed through is adapted to guide the powdered substrate into<br>
plasma region 25 and on to roller 71.<br>
Example 1<br>
[0054] The following example describes the plasma treatment of a rice hull ash sold<br>
under the name Ricesil™ (Rice Chemistry Inc. of Stuttgart, Arizona, USA), which is a<br>
biogenic amorphous silica, in accordance with the embodiment described in Fig. 2. In this<br>
example the distance between the glass dielectric plates attached to the two electrodes was<br>
6mm and the surface area of each electrode was (10cm x 50cm). The process gas used was<br>
helium. An atmospheric pressure glow discharge was generated by applying RF power of 1<br>
W/cm2 to two electrodes with a frequency of 29 kHz. The operating temperature was below<br>
40° C The powdered substrate was passed through both the first and second plasma zones<br>
using a reel-to-reel mechanism of the type described in Fig.2 with a guide means being<br>
utilised to assist in the transport of the powdered substrate out of the first and into the second<br>
plasma regions. The speed of the powdered substrate passing through both plasma zones was<br>
1m min-1 . The rice hull ash was placed onto a polyester non-woven fabric and another piece<br>
of the same non-woven fabric was placed on top of the powdered substrate to form a non-<br>
woven fabric envelope. The edges of the envelope formed by the two pieces of non-woven<br>
fabric were then sealed.<br>
[0055] Tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane (TMCTS) was supplied to an ultrasonic nozzle<br>
at a flow rate of 300 microlitres per minute. TMCTS droplets were discharged from the<br>
ultrasonic nozzle above the atmospheric pressure glow discharge. These TMCTS droplets<br>
passed through the atmospheric pressure glow discharge at the same time as the non-woven<br>
fabric envelope containing the a rice hull ash. The resulting treated rice hull ash was<br>
collected after the above treatment and was subjected to the following test.<br>
Test to assess the hydrophobicity of plasma treated and non-plasma treated rice hull ash using<br>
Water/isopropyl alcohol (TPA)solutions<br>
[0056] Solutions of water and IPA were made up in the ratios indicated in Table 1 and<br>
then samples of untreated Rice Hull Ash (0.100g) and TMCTS treated Rice Hull Ash<br>
(0.100g) were introduced into each solution using a spatula, with a view to assessing the<br>
degree of hydrophobicity of the treated particles. The samples were then shaken for 1min and<br>
allowed to settle for lmin. Samples which wet and sink to the bottom were identified as<br>
hydrophilic, samples where all the powder returned to the upper surface of the liquid were<br>
identified as hydrophobic and samples where some of the powder returned to the surface and<br>
some settled as sediment or stayed in suspension were identified as intermediate in Table 1<br>
below.<br>
[0057J Si solid state NMR spectra of the untreated Rice hull ash and treated rice hull<br>
ash are shown in Figs. 3a and 3b respectively. The process used for both samples was<br>
CPMAS - Cross Polarisation Magic Angle Spinning, Speed 5 KHz, cross polarization time 5<br>
ms, Pulse delay 5 sees.<br>
[0058] In the case of the untreated Rice hull ash (Fig. 3a) the main peak observed at -<br>
101.6 ppm was due to the presence of SiO3/2OH groups (Q3 silica species) and the shoulder<br>
to main peak observed at -112.2 ppm was due to SiO4/2 groups, (silica Q4 species), clearly<br>
indicating that untreated Rice hull ash is a form of silica.<br>
[0059] In the case of the treated Rice hull ash (Fig. 3b) the peaks were assigned as<br>
follows:-<br>
Peak Shift (centre) Assignment<br>
-35.05 MeHSiO2/2 (DH - polymer)<br>
-55.13 MeSiO2/2OR (T2 where R = H or aliphatic)<br>
-65.66 MeSiO3/2 (T3 units)<br>
-101.34 SiO3/2OH (Q3 units)<br>
-110.60 SiO4/2 (Q4 units)<br>
[0060] Peaks from DH, T2 and T3 originate from the cyclic monomer. The broad peak<br>
centred -101.3 has reduced significantly in intensity compared to the equivalent peak<br>
observed in Fig.3a. This is direct evidence that the cyclic has treated the Rice hull ash silica.<br>
