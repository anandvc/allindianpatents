Method of printing sheet-form substrates by the inkjet printing process<br>
The present invention relates to a method of printing sheet-form substrates, for example paper, plastics films or textile fibre materials, by the inkjet printing process, and to the inks used in the method.<br>
High demands are made nowadays of ink compositions for inkjet applications, especially for use in multicolour or photographic printing. For example, it is of considerable importance that the dyes on which the inks are based should correspond as closely as possible to the three primary colours yellow, cyan and magenta. The choice of suitable dyes is limited not only by the purity of colour and the desired brilliance of the colour reproduction, but also by the required shade. Although a large number of yellow acid dyes and direct dyes are known, only a few of them are suitable, for the reasons mentioned, for use in inkjet printing. In order to adjust the ink with respect to the required shade, known yellow inkjet inks often comprise mixtures of different types of yellow dye, for example mixtures of golden-yellow direct dyes with a lemon-yellow dye. Such lemon-yellow dyes have the disadvantage, however, that they have a tendency to catalytic fading in the green colour region when used in combination with cyan, and this has a markedly adverse effect in yellow inkjet inks comprising such lemon-yellow dyes.<br>
Dyes suitable for inkjet applications should also yield prints having good fastness to light, good wet fastness properties and high tinctorial strength, and they should exhibit good solubility in the solvent on which the ink is based. The inks should also be storage-stable and produce no precipitate on prolonged storage and, when used in inkjet printers, they should ensure high operating reliability of the printer.<br>
For that reason there is a continued need for an inkjet printing process in which improved yellow ink compositions are used and which does not have the above-mentioned disadvantages or has them to only a negligible degree.<br>

I<br>
The inks may also comprise solubilisers, for example e-caprolactam.<br>
There come into consideration as humectants in the inks according to the invention, for example, also urea or a mixture of sodium lactate (advantageously in the form of a 50 to 60 % aqueous solution) and glycerol and/or propylene glycol in amounts of preferably from 0.1 to 30 % by weight, especially from 2 to 30 % by weight<br>
The inks may comprise thickening agents of natural or synthetic origin, inter alia for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity.<br>
Examples of thickening agents which may be mentioned are commercially available alginate thickeners, starch ethers or locust bean gum ethers, especially sodium alginate on its own or in admixture with a modified cellulose, for example methyl-, ethyl-, carboxymethyl-, hydroxy-ethyl-, methylhydroxyethyl-. hydroxypropyl-or hydroxypropyimethyl-cellulose, especially with preferably from 20 to 25 % by weight carboxymethylcellulose. There may be mentioned as synthetic thickening agents also, for example, those based on poly(meth)acrylic acids or poly(meth)acrylamides.<br>
The inks comprise such thickening agents, for example, in an amount of from 0.01 to 2 % by weight, especially from 0.01 to 1 % by weight and preferably from 0.01 to 0.5 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
The inks may also comprise buffer substances, for example borax, borates, phosphates, polyphosphates or citrates. Examples which may be mentioned include borax, sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium pentapolyphosphate, as well as sodium citrate. They are used especially in amounts of from 0.1 to 3 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink, in order to establish a pH value of, for example, from 4 to 9, especially from 5 to 8.5.<br>
The inks may comprise surfactants or wetting agents as further additives.<br>
fo<br><br>
There come into consideration as surfactants or wetting agents commercially available anionic or non-ionic surfactants.<br>
The inks may also comprise conventional additives, for example antifoam agents or, especially, substances inhibiting fungal and/or bacterial growth. Such substances are usually used in amounts of from 0.01 to 1 % by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
As preservatives there come into consideration agents yielding formaldehyde, for example paraformaldehyde and trioxane, especially aqueous, approximately from 30 to 40 % by weight, formaldehyde solutions, imidazole compounds, for example 2-{4-thiazolyl)benz-imidazole, thiazole compounds, for example 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one or 2-n-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one, iodine compounds, nitriles, phenols, haloalkylthio compounds or pyridine derivatives, especially 1,2-benzisothiazolin-3-one or 2-n-octyl-isothiazolin-3-one.<br>
The inks can be prepared in a conventional manner by mixing the individual constituents, for example in the desired amount of water. Suspended substances and insoluble constituents contained in the inks are removed, for example, by filtration through filters having a pore size of from 0.2 to 0.5 [im.<br>
Preference is given to inks having a viscosity of from 1 to 40 mPas, especially from 1 to 20 mPa-s and preferably from 1 to 10 mPa-s.<br>
The inks according to the invention are suitable for use in recording systems in which the ink is expressed in the form of droplets from a small aperture and is directed towards a sheet-form substrate on which an image is produced. Suitable substrates are, for example, paper, plastics films or textile fibre materials, preferably paper or plastics films and especially paper. Suitable recording systems are, for example, commercially available inkjet printers for use in the printing of paper or textiles.<br>
There may be mentioned as examples of paper that can be printed with the inks according to the invention commercially available inkjet paper, photo paper, glossy paper, plastics-coated paper, for example Epson inkjet paper, Epson photo paper, Epson glossy paper, Epson glossy film, HP special inkjet paper, Encad photo gloss paper, llford photo paper. Plastics<br>
'/<br><br>
films that can be printed with the inks according to the invention are, for example, transÂ¬parent or milky/opaque. Suitable plastics films are, for example, 3M transparency film. Glossy paper, for example Epson glossy paper, is preferred.<br>
There come into consideration as textile fibre materials especially nitrogen-containing or hydroxy-group-containing fibre materials, for example textile fabric of cellulose, silk, wool or synthetic palyamides, especially silk.<br>
In inkjet printing, individual droplets of the ink are sprayed onto a substrate in a controlled manner from a nozzle. For this purpose, predominantly the continuous inkjet method and the drop-on-demand method are used. In the continuous inkjet method, the droplets are produced continuously and any droplets not required for the printing are conveyed to a collecting vessel and recycled, whereas in the drop-on-demand method droplets are produced and printed as required; that is to say, droplets are produced only when required for the printing. The production of the droplets can be effected, for example, by means of a piezo-inkjet head or by means of thermal energy (bubble jet). For the method according to the invention, printing by means of a piezo-inkjet head is preferred. Also preferred for the method according to the invention is printing in accordance with the continuous inkjet method.<br>
The inks according to the invention are suitable especially as the yellow component for multicolour or photographic printing and yield a neutral photographic yellow. It is possible largely to dispense with mixtures of different types of yellow dyes, since the required, ideal shade is already established when individual dyes of formula (1) are used.<br>
The dyes of formula (1) contained in the inks according to the invention have the further advantage that their preparation does not use toxic chemicals such as phosgene or p-cresidine, which are necessary for the production of commercially available inkjet yellow<br>
dyes, for example C.I. Direct Yellow 132 and C.I. Direct Yellow 86.<br>
The prints produced according to the invention exhibit good fastness to light and good water fastness properties. They are distinguished especially by high brilliance of colour and high tinctorial strength and are free of catalytic fading in the green colour region when used in<br>
/^<br><br>
combination with cyan. The inks according to the invention are storage-stable and produce no precipitate on prolonged storage.<br>
The Examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention. Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius, parts are parts by weight, and percentages relate to percentages by weight, unless indicated to the contrary. Parts by weight bear the same relationship to parts by volume as kilograms to litres.<br>

0.3 part      of Proxel GXL (commercially available preservative) 0.1 part     of Forafac 1110 D (commercially available wetting agent) 72.93 parts of water<br>
The inks A, B, C and D so obtained are each used for printing a commercially available inkjet paper, photo paper or a glossy film (e.g. Epson glossy film) by means of a drop-on-demand inkjet printer. The prints exhibit a high brilliance of colour and high tinctorial strength and are free of catalytic fading in the green colour region when used in combination with cyan. Prints having a high brilliance of colour and high tinctorial strength, which are free of catalytic fading in the green colour region when used in combination with cyan, are also obtained when there is used, instead of the dye of formula (101) in the form of the sodium salt, the same amount of a dye of formula (101), which has been rendered largely free of inorganic salts, in the form of the lithium salt.<br><br>
If the procedure described above is followed, but there is used in each of inks A, B, C and D, instead of 1.67 parts of a dye of formula (101), the same amount of a dye, which has been rendered largely free of inorganic salts, of the general formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
