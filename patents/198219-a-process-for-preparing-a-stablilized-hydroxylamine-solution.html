The present invention relates tc  a process fo preparing  a  stabilized hydroxylamine   solution.<br><br>
r<br><br>
Hydroxylamine,   especially  in the  form of   its   salt with  sulfuric acid,   is an important intermediate  for  the chemical industry,   and is  widely employed in chemical  syntheses.   It  is   frequently necessary  to employ hydroxylamine in  the form of   a  solution of the   free  base,   which  is  generally  liberated   from  a hydroxylammonium salt such   as,   for example,   hydroxylammonium sulphate or   hydroxylammonium chloride,   by  the  action of  an appropriate base,   such   as  ammonia,   sodium hydroxide solution  or an  alcoholate.   Neutral   and  alkaline  hydroxylamine   solutions   are unstable  and   decompose  to  form ainmonia,   nitrogen,   oxides  of nitroger,   and water,   so that their  transportation  or   storage  is highly problematic.   The   rate of   decomposition   increases with rising  temperature,   rising pH and rising  concentration of catalytically active impurities.<br>
In  order   to avoid the decomposition  of the  hydroxylamine,   a stabilizer  is   added to the   solutions.   Numerous   stabilizers   for hydroxylamine  are  already known.   Proposals which  have been made are:   thioglycolic  acid   (JP-A-58069843),   glycerol  monoethers     and ethylene  oxide   adducts   thereof   (DE-A-29   19   554), hydroxyar.thraquinones   (DE-A-33   43  600),     hydroxyguinolines (DE-A-33  45  734),   polyhydroxyhexano-1,4-lactone   (DE-A-33 45 733), anthocyar.ins   (DE-A-33  47   260),   hydroxyguinaldines,   flavones, benzonitrile,   N-phenyl-N-hydroxythiourea   (DE-A-36   01   803), flavans   (DE-A-33   43   599),   thiosulfates,   mercaptobenzothiazoles, mercaptoalkanols,   mercaptothiazolines,   thiuram disulfides, thioureas   {EP-A-516  933),   the tetrasodium salt  of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid,   the  trisodium salt of N-hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetic acid,   polyvinylpyrrolidone or     poly-N-vinyl-5-ethyl-2-oxa2olidinone   (US-A-3,145,082),   amdde oximes   {US-A-3,4 80,391),   hydroxamic   acids   (US-3,480,391), hydroxyureas   (US-3,544,270),   dipyridyl compounds   (JP-A-^58069842),   aminoquinolines   (JP-A- 58069844),   phenanthrolines   (JP-A-   58069841),   and polyhydroxyphehols   (JP-A-   4878099}.<br>
However,   none of  the  stabilizers proposed   to date has been  able to provide hydroxylamine  solutions with sufficient stabilization for no notable decomposition of the hydroxylamine to occur, especially during  storage.<br><br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a better means of stabilizing hydroxy1amine solutions. We have now found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by using as  stabilizer at least one  compound of the formula I;<br>

ft'      is OH, SH, NH;, CN, COOH, alkyl or alkoxy,<br>
or the salts thereof, with the exceptions of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid  and N-hydroxyethylenediaminetriacetic acid and salts thereof.<br>
I'he present invention therefore provides stabilized hydroxylaraine jolutions comprising hydroxylamine and at least one compound of :he formula I.<br>
The novel solutions comprise hydroxylamine in essentially pure form as a free base or as an at least partially neutralized lydroxylamine salt; in other words, free hydroxylamine is mixed rfith the hydroxylamine salt.<br>
The  stabilizers employed in accordance with the invention can  be ased to stabilize all types of hydroxylamine solutions. They may be aqueous solutions or solutions of hydroxylamine in an organic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, n~propanol, isopropanol, acetone, tetrahydrofuran, etc., or may be mixtures of water and organic solvents. The stabilizers employed in accordance with the invention are also soluble in the solvents in which hydroxylamine is soluble. If appropriate, solubility can be obtained by the choice of appropriate groups R^ to R4 and A.<br>
Hydroxylamine solutions are in general obtained by reacting a hydroxylammonium salt, especially hydroxylammonium sulfate, hydroxylammonium chloride and hydroxylammonium phosphate,, with an appropriate base, such as ammonia, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide or calcium hydroxide. In the case of complete neutralization of the hydroxylainmonium salt a solution is obtained which comprises free hydroxylamine and the salt derived from the base cation and the acid anion which is present in the hydroxylaBimoniuro salt. The salt can be separated off completely or partially. The hydroxylammonium salt can also be neutralized only partially with the base. In this case a solution is obtained which comprises not only free hydroxylamine and the salt mentioned but also unreacted hydroxylammonium salt. All of these solutions can be stabilized in accordance with the invention, the nature of the anion in the hydroxylammonium salt not being critical.<br>
In the context of the present invoition, alkyl is a straight-chain or branched radical of preferably 1 to 18 carbon atoms, especially 1 to 6 carbon atoms and, in particular, 1 to 4 carbon atoms. The same comments apply to the alkyl group in alkoxy.<br><br>
Alkylone  is  a   straight-chain  or branched  divalent   radical  of, preferably,   2   to  6   carbon atoms,   especially   2   to  4   carbon  atoms.<br>
Alkenylene and aikynylene are straight-chain or  branched divalent radicals  of,   preferably,   3  to  6  carbon atoms   and,   in  particular, 3  or   4   carbon  atoms.<br>
rycloalkylene  and cycloalkenylene  are  preferably cyclopentylene Dr cyclohexylene or,   respectively,   cyclopentenylene or  cyclo-hexenylene.<br>
Rrylene  is  preferably  an  aromatic  Ce-Cjo  hydrocarbon radical  or phenylene.<br>
The  saturated or  unsaturated  heterocycle   is   preferably pyrrolidinylene,   piperidinylene,   pyrrolylene or pyridinylene.  The heterocycle is attached by carbon  atoms to the two nitrogen atoms of  the  formula  I.<br>
Acyl   is   straight-chain  or branched  and preferably has   1  to   19 carbon  atoms.<br>
A        is   preferably  alkylene,   cycloalkylene,   arylene or<br>
—	X-e-NR—BH—<br>
n<br>
and   in  particular   is  alkylene,   cycloalkylene  or<br>
—	X-f-NR—BH—<br>
In this case the radicals R^ to R* independently of one another are preferably CH2COOH, CH2CH20H, CHjCHjNHz or<br>
L jj  and in particular are CHjCOOH °J^ L Jj<br>
R' is preferably in the ortho position and in particular is OH, COOH or a branched (bulky) alkyl radical, such as isopropyl, tert-butyl etc.<br>
The stabilizers according to the invention can also be employed in the form of salts. Particularly suitable salts -re alkali metal salts, such as sodium salts or potassium salts, or ammonium salts, if acidic functions are present, including the salts with amines, such as triethylamine or trlethanolamine, and with hydroxylamine. The latter may arise if the compounds of the formula I are introduced into the hydroxylamine solution to be<br><br>
stabilized. Also suitable are acid addition salts with inorganic acids, such as HF, HCl, HBr, H2SO4, H3p04, etc., if basic functions are present.<br>
A further preferred embodiment is a stabilized solution comprising as stabilizer a compound of the formula I in which A is alJtylene or  cycloalkylene and Ri to R
CH2—<br>
where R' is as defined above and in particular is OH, SH or NH;, If A is<br>
X-hHR—B-j-<br>
the compounds of the formula I are polyethyleneimine or polypropyleneimine polymers, which are in general weakly crosslinked. The repeating units of said formula may be identical ^or different. This applies in particular when units are present which ars substituted on the nitrogen atom, i.e. R is other than hydrogen in at least some of the units. The chosen degree of substitution can lie within a wide range and is in general in the range from 5 to 98 %. The slight crosslinking which is the result of the preparation of the polyethyleneimines and<br>
polypropyleneimihes can be increased by polyether bridges between the polymers. The polyether bridge is formed by alkylating some of the nitrogen atoms with epichlorohydrine followed by ethoxylation.<br>
In the case of polyethyleneimine or polypropyleneimine polymers, the radicals Ri to R* are preferably H or alkyl.<br>
The weight average molecular weight of the polymers can be chosen within a wide range, and is generally in the range from 800 to 2,000,000, in particular from 1,000 to 1,500,000 and, in the case of more highly crosslinked polymers, in the range from 50,000 to 2,000,000.<br>
In accordance with a further preferred embodiment, the stabilized hydroxy1amine solution comprises at least one compound of the formula I in which A is<br><br>

Particularly preferred compounds in this context are:<br>
a weakly crosslinked polyethyleneimine with an average molecular weight in the range from 1,000 to 2,000,000;<br>
carboxymethylated polyethyleneimines with a degree of substitution of from 25 to 98 % and an average molecular weight in the range from 1,500 to 1,500,000;<br>
carboxyethylated polyethyleneimines with a degree of substitution of from 5 to 50 % and an average molecular weight in the range from 1,000 to 1,500,000;<br>
partially amidated polyethyleneimines(one or two of the radicals Ri to R* are Cj to Cig-acyl) with a degree of substitution of from 5 to 50% and an average molecular weight in the range from 1,000 to 1,500,000;<br>
polyether-crosslinked polyethyleneimines with an average molecular weight in the range from 50,000 to 1,500,000;<br>
hydrophobically modified polyethyleneimines (R = -CH2CH2NHCOR5, where RS is CHR^CORS and R* is Cu to Cig-alkyl, especially hexadecyl) with a degree of substitution of from 1 to 7 % and an average molecular weight in the range from 1,500 to 1,500,00 [sic]. These polymers are obtainable by reacting the corresponding ethyleneimines (R = CH2CH2NH2) with the corresponding alkyl diketenes;<br>
hydroxyethyl-substituted polyethyleneimines with a degree of substitution of 80 to 100 % and an average molecular weight in the range from 1 to 2,000,000;<br>
polyethyleneimine dithiocarbamates (R ~  CSSH]  with a degree of substitution of from 30 to 60 % and an average molecular weight of from 2,000 to 1,000,000, and the sodium salts thereof.<br>
Some of the above polyethyleneimines are commercially obtainable, and are marketed, for example, by BASF AG under the name LUPASOL®.<br><br>
According   to a   further  preferred embodiment the  stabilized, hydroxylamine   solution   comprises   as   stabilizer  a  compound of   the formula  I   in  which A is  cyclohexylene or  -CHjCHz- and  Ri   to R* are CHjCOOH or<br>
-CH2—<br>
preferably  CHjCOOH,   where  R'   is  OH,   SH,   NH;  or   COOH.<br>
With   particular preference  these compounds  are<br>
trans-1, 2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N ' ,N'--tetraacetic   acid and/or<br>
N,N' -di( 2-hydroxybenzyl)ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic   acid  and<br>
the  salts   thereof.<br>
The compounds   of  the   formula   I  are  known   and commercially<br>
available   or can be  prepared by analogy with known methods.<br>
The novel   stabilized hydroxylamine  solutions  comprise  the compounds   of   formula   I   in  a quantity which is   sufficient   for stabilization.   They preferably contain   from 0.001   to   20  %     by weight   (from a 0  to 200,000  ppm),   in particular  from 0.001   to 10 by weight,   particularly preferably  from  0.01   to  5   %  by weight, very particularly preferably   from  0.02   to 2  %  by weight,   of  a compound   of  the   formula  I,   based on  the  hydroxylamine  content. The concentration of   hydroxylamine  is   in  general   1   -   100   %  by weight,   in  particular   1   -   70   * by weight,   based on the overall weight of   the  solution.<br>
The  stabilizer can be added prior to or  following  neutralization of the  hydroxylamine  salt,   but preferably prior  to the neutralization.<br>
The  compounds  of  the  formula I  are effective  in  a wide temperature range.   For  instance,   they stabilize hydroxylamine solutions   at  fron--20»C to   ISO^C,   preferably  at -lOoc - lOOoc. However,   they are also suitable  as  stabilizers  at markedly higher temperatures,   under  the pressures which   are necessary to liquefy the   solution.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for preparing astabihzed hydroxylamine solution comprising the step of adding a stabilizer selected from at least one compound of the formula I<br>

20 ml   of   50   I   strength   aqueous   hydroxylamine  solution were charged  to a  50 ml   round-bottomed glass   flask,   and   500   ppm   (m/m) of   stabilizer  of   formula   I,   based on   the mass   of  hydroxylamine, were  added  in  each  case.   The  flask was  maintained  at  room temperature or  heated with   an oil  bath  to 100°C and maintained at this   temperature.   The  hydroxylamine contents  of   the  stabilized solutions   at room temperature and at   100°c were  determined by redox titration after  defined periods.   For this  purpose,   defined quantities  of   sample were withdrawn  from the  solutions,   boiled for  5 minutes  with   excess   ammonium iron(III)   salt   solution  in sulfuric   acid,   and  the   iron(II)   salt  formed was  back-titrated with cerium(IV)   salt   solution.   The end point was   determined potentiometrically.<br>
Table  1   gives  the results   at room temperature while Table  2 gives those  at   lOO'^C.   In  order  to demonstrate  the outstanding stabilizing action  of  the compounds of   formula I  on hydroxylamine solutions,   measurements  with unstabilized hydroxylamine solutions,   and with hydroxylamine solutions   stabilized  using ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid   (EDTA),   are shown   for comparison.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
