200610024559.3, filed with the Chinese Patent Office on March 9, 2006, entitled<br>
"METHOD FOR IMPLEMENTING INTERNAL CONNECTION AT MEDIA<br>
GATEWAY", the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to media gateway and media gateway control<br>
technologies that enable separation between bearer and control in the field of<br>
communication technologies, and particularly to a method and apparatus for implementing<br>
an internal connection at a media gateway.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The definition of the Next Generation Network (NGN) always changes with the<br>
development of the NGN. In the "2004 Global NGN Peak Forum" hold by the International<br>
Telecommunication Union (ITU), the standard of the NGN is defined as a packet based<br>
network, which can offer various services including telecommunication services and utilize<br>
transport technologies that support different bandwidths and Quality of Service (QoS)<br>
guarantee. The final direction and extent of the development of the NGN is thus determined.<br>
In view of the current deployment of the NGN, two critical components, a<br>
Media Gateway Controller (MGC) and a Media Gateway (MG), are generally utilized for<br>
networking. The MGC is responsible for a call control function, and the MG is responsible<br>
for a service bearer function, thereby realizing separation of the call control plane and the<br>
service bearer plane. The above two components can evolve separately, so that it is possible<br>
to share network resources fully, simplify equipment upgrade and service expansion, and<br>
lower the cost of development and maintenance greatly.<br>
The media gateway control protocol is the main protocol for communication<br>
between an MGC and an MG At present, the widely-used protocols include the Gateway<br>
Control Protocol/H.248 (H.248/MeGaCo) and the Media Gateway Control Protocol<br><br><br>
(MGCP), and the communication protocol among MGs is the RealTime Transfer Protocol<br>
(RTP), as shown in Figure 1.<br>
The MGCP is established by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in<br>
October, 1999 and revised in January, 2003. Version 1 of the H.248/MeGaCo protocol is<br>
established jointly by the IETF and the ITU in November, 2000, and version 3 of the<br>
H.248/MeGaCo protocol is released by the ITU in September, 2005.<br>
Eight basic commands, Add, Modify, Subtract, Move, AuditValue,<br>
AuditCapabilities, Notify and ServiceChange, are provided by the H.248/MeGaCo protocol<br>
between the MGC and the MG.<br>
Nine basic commands, NotificationRequest (RQNT), Notify (NTFY),<br>
CreateConnection (CRCX), ModifyConnection (MDCX), DeleteConnection (DLCX),<br>
AuditEndpoint (AUEP), AuditConnection (AUCX), ReStartlnProgress (RSIP) and<br>
EndpointConfiguraton (EPCF), are provided by the MGCP between the MGC and the MG.<br>
The H.248/MeGaCo protocol is developed from the MGCP. Taking the H.248<br>
for example, an MG bears services by means of the resources thereon. Those resources can<br>
be abstractly expressed as terminations, including physical terminations and temporary<br>
terminations. The physical termination is a physical entity of semi-permanent existence,<br>
such as a Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) channel. The temporary termination is a<br>
public resource that is temporarily obtained upon request and released after having been<br>
used, such as an RTP stream. The combination of terminations is abstractly expressed as a<br>
context. A context may include multiple terminations. The relationship among terminations<br>
is usually expressed as a topology. A termination that has not been associated with other<br>
terminations is included by a special context called Null context.<br>
In such an abstract model of protocol, connection of a call lie actually in<br>
operations of terminations and contexts, and the operations are accomplished by command<br>
requests and replies between the MGC and the MG. Command parameters, also called<br>
descriptors, are classified into property, signal, event and statistic.<br>
In particular, property represents the specification of resource requirements,<br>
usually sent to the MG by the MGC or set by the MG itself, such as a maximum or minimum<br><br>
value set for a jitter buffer; signal is used by the MGC to instruct the MG to operate the<br>
resources, such as play a dial tone, a ring back tone or a busy lone to a user; event is used by<br>
the MGC to instruct the MG to monitor status, such as monitor off-hook, hang-up, dialing<br>
and flash-hook performed by a user; and statistic represents the information of resource<br>
usage. These statistic parameters are usually calculated by the MG, and some of them can be<br>
enabled or disabled, i.e. activated or deactivated, selectively by the MGC. Certain<br>
parameters with a service correlation are aggregated logically into a package.<br>
At present, a typical abstract logic model for an Internet Protocol (IP) voice call<br>
is that, two parties of the call, i.e. a calling party and a called party, each has a context<br>
containing two terminations, and the two parties of the call is present at different MGs. In<br>
particular, for an Access Media Gateway (AMG), an Integrated Access Device (IAD) or a<br>
Trunk Media Gateway (TMG), the two terminations may be a physical termination and a<br>
temporary termination respectively, i.e., connected to a circuit network and a packet network.<br>
For a Border Media Gateway (BMG) or a Packet Media Gateway (PMG), the two<br>
terminations may be two temporary terminations, i.e., connected to different packet<br>
networks. Each of the terminations described above represents a transmission type or media<br>
codec type, such as TDM, RTP, and Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR). Therefore, system<br>
resources, such as a Digital Signal Processor (DSP), are also required for the codec<br>
conversion between any two terminations.<br>
If the two parties of a call are present at the same MG, such a call may be treated<br>
as an internal connection, and no conversion between two codec formats may be required<br>
practically. For example, two subscribers for the Plain Old Telephone Service (POTS) at one<br>
AMG may make a call without a transfer of (POST1-IP1)-(IP2-POST2), and without a<br>
codec conversion, i.e., TDM-RTP, performed by a DSP. In other words, one context<br>
containing two physical terminations rather than two contexts each containing one physical<br>
termination and one temporary termination may be utilized. Additionally, two media<br>
streams at one PMG may also interwork without a transfer of (IPI -IP1')-(IP2'-IP2), and<br>
without a codec conversion, i.e., RTP1-RTP2, performed by a DSP. In other words, one<br>
context containing two temporary terminations rather than two contexts each containing two<br><br><br>
temporary terminations may be utilized. As a result of the reduction of the codec conversion,<br>
the expensive resources, such as a DSP, may be saved and the QoS of media transmissions<br>
may be further guaranteed.<br>
In such a case in which an internal connection may be created, currently, there<br>
are two implementation modes for making determination and performing control. One is a<br>
controlled mode, in which the MGC determines two parties of a call are present at the same<br>
MG, and instructs the MG to add two terminations representing respectively the two parties<br>
into one context. The other is an autonomous mode, in which the MGC instructs the MG to<br>
create one context for each party of the call without determining whether the two parties of<br>
the call are present at the same MG, while the MG determines by itself the two contexts are<br>
present at the same MG, and connects the two terminations representing the two parties of<br>
the call directly.<br>
In practice applications, the above two modes exist concurrently. However,<br>
because there is no standardized means for determining and controlling an internal<br>
connection, the MGC and the MG do not know how to deal with the scenarios that are<br>
needed to be supported. For example, the scenarios may be that, the MGC supports the<br>
determining and controlling of an internal connection, and the MG can also create an<br>
internal connection as instructed by the MGC; the MGC supports the determining and<br>
controlling of an internal connection, while the MG does not support the creating of an<br>
internal connection (for example, there is no internal logic for connecting two TDM<br>
channels); the MGC does not determine and control an internal connection, while the MG<br>
determines and controls an internal connection by itself; and the MG can determine and<br>
control an internal connection by itself, but the creating of an internal connection by the MG<br>
itself needs to be disabled when the MGC is implementing a service (such as a loop-back<br>
test). This problem becomes especially severe if the MGC and the MG are supplied from<br>
different equipment vendors.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Embodiments of the present invention provides a method and apparatus for<br><br>
implementing an internal connection at a media gateway, so that a media gateway controller<br>
and a media gateway with different connection capabilities may cooperate well, to benefit<br>
from the internal connection to a greatest extent.<br>
A method for implementing an internal connection at a media gateway according<br>
to an embodiment of the present invention includes the steps of:<br>
acquiring, by a media gateway controller, information on the capability of a media<br>
gateway for supporting an internal connection; and<br>
performing, by the media gateway controller, corresponding control according to the<br>
capability of the media gateway for supporting an internal connection,<br>
wherein the internal connection is a direct connection between two parties of a call at<br>
the same media gateway.<br>
The capability of the media gateway for supporting an internal connection<br>
includes:<br>
supporting that an internal connection is determined and controlled by the media<br>
gateway controller;<br>
supporting that an internal connection is determined and controlled by the media<br>
gateway itself; and<br>
not supporting an internal connection.<br>
Preferably, performing corresponding control according to the capability of the<br>
media gateway for supporting an internal connection includes:<br>
when the internal connection is to be determined and controlled by the media gateway<br>
controller, and the media gateway controller determines that the two parties of the call need<br>
to be connected internally, instructing, by the media gateway controller, the media gateway<br>
to add two terminations representing respectively the two parties of the call into a same<br>
context, so that the two terminations are connected with each other directly; and<br>
when the internal connection is to be determined and controlled by the media gateway<br>
itself, instructing, by the media gateway controller, the media gateway to create one context<br>
for each party of the call, and add a termination representing the calling party into the<br>
context created for the calling party, and add a termination representing the called party into<br><br>
the context created for the called party; and when determining the two parties of the call<br>
need to be connected internally, connecting, by the media gateway, the two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call with each other.<br>
Preferably, the media gateway controller acquires the information on the<br>
capability of the media gateway for supporting an internal connection by auditing the media<br>
gateway.<br>
Preferably, the media gateway controller acquires the information on the<br>
capability of the media gateway for supporting an internal connection through<br>
configuration.<br>
A media gateway supporting an internal connection is provided in another<br>
embodiment of the present invention. The media gateway has a capability of supporting that<br>
an internal connection is determined and controlled by a media gateway controller; and/or,<br>
has a capability of supporting that an internal connection is determined and controlled by the<br>
media gateway itself; and/or does not supporting an internal connection.<br>
When it is determined by the media gateway controller that two parties of a call<br>
need to be connected internally, the media gateway adds, as instructed by the media gateway<br>
controller, two terminations representing respectively the two parties of the call into a same<br>
context, so that the two terminations are connected with each other directly.<br>
When the internal connection is to be determined and controlled by the media<br>
gateway itself, as instructed by the media gateway controller, the media gateway creates one<br>
context for each party of the call, and adds a termination representing the calling party into<br>
the context created for the calling party, and adds a termination representing the called party<br>
into the context created for the called party. When determining the two parties of the call is<br>
to be connected internally, the media gateway connects the two terminations representing<br>
respectively the two parties of the call with each other;<br>
When the media gateway does not support an internal connection, the media<br>
gateway controller does not need to determine and control an internal connection.<br>
Preferably, according to service characteristics of each call, the media gateway<br>
controller determines and controls whether to allow the media gateway to implement an<br><br><br>
internal connection for the call by the media gateway itself.<br>
In comparison with the prior art, in the technical solutions according to the<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the MGC acquires capability of the MG for<br>
supporting an internal connection through audit or configuration; and according to the<br>
obtained capability, the implementation of the internal connection is determined and<br>
controlled by the MGC or by the MG itself. Therefore, the MGC may implement adaptively<br>
an internal connection in different ways according to the capability of the MG, especially<br>
when the MGC and the MG are supplied from different equipment vendors and the MGC<br>
does not know the capability of the MG in advance. As long as the MG supports an internal<br>
connection, regardless of the way of supporting, the MGC may take full advantage of the<br>
internal connection, i.e., utilize the internal connection for any call for which the internal<br>
connection is required and may be implemented. This may guarantee and develop, to a<br>
greatest extent, the benefits from the reduction of codec conversion due to the internal<br>
connection.<br>
If an internal connection is determined and implemented by the MG itself, the<br>
MG notifies the MGC to modify the call model at the MGC to be the same as that at the MG<br>
after implementing the internal connection, so that no complicated conversion between the<br>
two call models is required by the MG, thereby decreasing the processing complexity and<br>
overhead.<br>
The MGC may instruct the MG to enable or disable the capability for<br>
determining and implementing an internal connection by the MG itself. This allows the<br>
MGC to enable or disable the capability for determining and implementing an internal<br>
connection by the MG itself flexibly based on characteristics of a service, so as to better<br>
meet demands of the service. For example, the capability for determining and implementing<br>
an internal connection by the MG itself need to be disabled in the case of a loop-back test.<br>

Detailed Description of the Embodiments<br>
For better understanding of the objects, technical solutions and advantages of the<br>
present invention, the present invention are described below in further detail with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the present invention, for a service for which an internal connection may be<br>
implemented, the MGC acquires the capability of the MG with respect to whether an<br>
internal connection is supported through audit or configuration; and according to different<br>
capabilities of the MG, the internal connection is implemented for the service in different<br>
ways. Therefore, the MGC may implement adaptively an internal connection in different<br>
ways according to the capability of the MG, especially when the MGC and the MG are<br>
supplied from different equipment vendors and the MGC does not know the capability of the<br>
MG in advance. As long as the MG supports an internal connection, regardless of the way of<br>
supporting, the MGC may take full advantage of the internal connection., i.e., utilize the<br>
internal connection for any call for which the internal connection is required and may be<br>
implemented. This may guarantee and develop, to a greatest extent, the benefits from the<br>
reduction of codec conversion due to the internal connection.<br>
In particular, if an internal connection is to be determined and controlled by the<br>
media gateway controller, when determining two parties of a call can be connected<br>
internally, the media gateway controller instructs the media gateway to add two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call into the same context, so that the two<br>
terminations are connected with each other directly. If the internal connection is to be<br>
determined and controlled by the media gateway itself, when determining the two parties of<br>
the call can be connected internally, the media gateway connects two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call with each other directly in one context,<br><br>
or across two contexts.<br>
A method for implementing an internal connection at an MG according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 2 includes the following steps.<br>
Step 201: The MGC acquires the capability of the MG for supporting an internal<br>
connection through auditing the MG In other words, the MGC sends an audit request<br>
command regarding an internal connection capability to the MG, and the MG reports the<br>
capability of the MG for an internal connection in a corresponding audit reply command.<br>
Step 202: The MGC sends different instructions to the MG according to different<br>
capabilities of the MG for supporting an internal connection. The capability of the MG for<br>
supporting an internal connection includes: supporting that an internal connection is<br>
determined and controlled by the MGC; supporting that an internal connection is determined<br>
and controlled by the MG itself; and not supporting an internal connection.<br>
In particular, if the capability of the MG lies in only supporting the determining<br>
and controlling of an internal connection by the MGC, the internal connection is to be<br>
determined and controlled by the MGC.<br>
If the capability of the MG lies in only supporting the determining and<br>
controlling of an internal connection by the MG itself, it is optional that the internal<br>
connection is to be determined and controlled by the MGC or the MG itself.<br>
If the capability of the MG lies in supporting the determining and controlling of<br>
an internal connection by both the MGC and the MG itself, it is optional that the internal<br>
connection is to be determined and controlled by the MGC or the MG itself.<br>
If the capability of the MG lies in not supporting an internal connection, i.e.,<br>
connecting two terminations both at the MG with each other is not supported by the MG, for<br>
example, when there is no internal logic for connecting two TDM channels., the MGC does<br>
not determine and control any internal connection.<br>
When the capability of the MG includes supporting the determining and<br>
controlling of an internal connection by the MG itself, the MGC further determines and<br>
controls, according to service characteristics of each call, whether to allow the MG to<br>
implement an internal connection for the call by the MG itself. For example, the capability<br><br><br>
for determining and implementing an internal connection by the MG itself are disabled in<br>
the case of a loop-back test. In this case, the MGC sends an enable or disable instruction to<br>
the MG, so as to control whether an internal connection is to be determined and controlled<br>
by the MG itself. This allows the MGC to enable or disable the capability for determining<br>
and implementing an internal connection by the MG itself flexibly according to<br>
characteristics of a service, so as to better meet demands of the service.<br>
If an internal connection is to be determined and controlled by the MGC finally,<br>
i.e., with the first condition is met, the process proceeds to Step 203. If an internal<br>
connection is to be determined and controlled by the MG itself rather than by MGC finally,<br>
i.e., with the second condition is met, the process proceeds to Step 206.<br>
Step 203: If the MGC determines that an internal connection can be created<br>
between two parties of a call, the process proceeds to Step 204; if the MGC determines that<br>
the internal connection cannot be created between the two parties of the call, the process<br>
also proceeds to Step 206.<br>
Step 204: The MGC instructs the MG to add two terminations representing<br>
respectively the two parties of the call into the same context, so that the two terminations are<br>
connected with each other directly. Then the process proceeds to Step 205.<br>
Step 205: The MG creates, as instructed by the MGC, one context to implement<br>
an internal connection between the two parties of the call, and then the process for<br>
implementing the internal connection ends.<br>
Step 206: The MGC instructs the MG to create one context for each party of the<br>
call. In a prior art approach, a termination representing the calling party is added into the<br>
context created for the calling party, and a termination representing the called party is added<br>
into the context created for the called party. Then the process proceeds to Step 207.<br>
Step 207: The MG determines whether an internal connection can be created<br>
between the two parties of the call. If the internal connection can be created between the two<br>
parties of the call, the process proceeds to Step 209. If the internal connection cannot be<br>
created between the two parties of the call the process turns to Step 208. For a call for which<br>
an internal connection cannot be created, which is determined by the MGC in Step 203, the<br><br>
MG gets the same result of determination. In this case, the process therefore also proceeds to<br>
Step 208.<br>
Step 208: The MG operates as instructed by the MGC according to a prior art<br>
approach, i.e., does not create an internal connection. Then the process for implementing the<br>
internal connection ends.<br>
Step 209: The MG creates only one context, and connects the two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call with each other directly in the context.<br>
Then the process proceeds to Step 210.<br>
Step 210: The MG notifies the MGC to modify the call model to be the same as<br>
the actual call model at the MG, i.e., the two terminations representing respectively the two<br>
parties of the call are added into one context, and the MGC adapts the call model thereof<br>
according to synchronization information. Such a connection is referred to as an explicit<br>
connection. Then the process for implementing the internal connection ends.<br>
After the call models at the MG and the MGC are synchronized, no complicated<br>
conversion between the two call models needs to be performed by the MG, thereby reducing<br>
the processing complexity and overhead.<br>
A method for implementing an internal connection at an MG according to a<br>
second embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 3 includes the following steps.<br>
Step 301: The internal connection capability of each MG is configured at the<br>
MGC, so that the MGC may obtain the capability of a MG for supporting an internal<br>
connection. This configuration may be made statically in advance or dynamically through a<br>
maintaining interface.<br>
Steps 302 to 308 are similar to Steps 202 to 208, and the description thereof is<br>
omitted here.<br>
Step 309: The MG creates one context for each party of the call as instructed by<br>
the MGC, and connects the two terminations representing respectively the two parties of the<br>
call with each other across the two contexts. The MG further creates a mapping between the<br>
operations performed by the MGC and the MG with respect to their respective call models.<br>
Then the process for implementing the internal connection ends.<br><br><br>
Such a connection is referred to as an implicit connection, in which the call<br>
model of the MG is substantially the same as that of the MGC, and the two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call are added into the two contexts<br>
respectively, while the MG connects the two terminations representing respectively the two<br>
parties of the call with each other by itself.<br>
In the above embodiments, the interactions between the MGC and the MG are<br>
implemented through the media gateway control protocol, in which the capability of the MG<br>
for supporting an internal connection, and the enabling or disabling of the capability for<br>
implementing an internal connection by the MG itself, are defined via the extended property<br>
parameters in the media gateway control protocol.<br>
A media gateway supporting an internal connection is provided according to<br>
another embodiment of the present invention. The media gateway has a capability of<br>
supporting that an internal connection is determined and controlled by a media gateway<br>
controller; and/or, a capability of supporting that an internal connection is determined and<br>
controlled by the media gateway itself; and/or does not supporting an internal connection.<br>
When it is determined by the media gateway controller that two parties of a call<br>
need to be connected internally, the media gateway adds, as instructed by the media gateway<br>
controller, two terminations representing respectively the two parties of the call into the<br>
same context, so that the two terminations are connected with each other directly.<br>
When the internal connection is to be determined and controlled by the media<br>
gateway itself, as instructed by the media gateway controller, the media gateway creates one<br>
context for each party of the call, and adds a termination representing the calling party into<br>
the context created for the calling party, and adds a termination representing the called party<br>
into the context created for the called party. When determining the two parties of the call<br>
need to be connected internally, the media gateway connects the two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call with each other;<br>
When the media gateway does not support an internal connection, the media<br>
gateway controller does not need to determine and control an internal connection.<br>
When determining that an internal connection needs to be created between the<br><br><br>
two parties of the call, the MG connects, as instructed by the MGC, the two terminations<br>
representing respectively the two parties of the call with each other directly in one context,<br>
and notifies the MGC to modify the call model thereof to be the same as the actual call<br>
model at the MG<br>
According to service characteristics of each call, the media gateway controller<br>
determines and controls whether to allow the media gateway to implement an internal<br>
connection for the call by the media gateway itself.<br>
Although the present invention has been illustrated and described with reference<br>
to some preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood by those<br>
ordinary skilled in the art that various changes in form and in detail can be made to the<br>
present invention without departing from the scope of the present invention.<br><br>
