With regard to the use of protecting groups throughout the reaction steps described, the formation of salts, e.g. for the purposes of purification, and the synthesis of isomers the following considerations may apply:<br>
Protecting groups: In the reaction steps described above, one or more functional groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, amino, or mercapto, may need to be protected in the starting materials by protecting groups. The protecting groups employed may already be present in precursors and should protect the functional groups concerned against unwanted secondary reactions, such as acylations, etherifications, esterifications, oxidations, solvolysis, and similar reactions. It is a characteristic of protecting groups that they lend themselves readily, i.e. without undesired secondary reactions, to removal, typically by solvolysis. reduction, photolysis or also by enzyme activity, for example under conditions analogous to-physiological conditions, and that they are not present in the end-products. The specialist knows, or can easily establish, which protecting groups are suitable with the reactions mentioned hereinabove and hereinafter. The protection of such functional groups by such protecting groups, the protecting groups themselves, and their removal reactions are described for example in standard reference works, such as J. F. W. McOmie, "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, London and New York 1973, in T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis", Third edition, Wiley, New York 1999, in "The Peptides"; Volume 3 (editors: E. Gross and J. Meienhofer), Academic Press, London and New York 1981, in "Methoden der organischen Chemie" (Methods of organic chemistry), Houben Weyl, 4th edition, Volume 15/1, Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974, in H.-D. Jakubke and H. Jescheit, "Aminosauren, Peptide, Proteine" (Amino acids, peptides, proteins), Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, Deerfield Beach, and Basel 1982, and in Jochen Lehmann, "Chemie der Kohlenhydrate: Monosaccharide und Derivate" (Chemistry of carbohydrates: monosaccharides and derivatives), Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1974.<br>
Salts: Acid addition saJts may be produced from the free bases in known manner, and vice- versa.<br>
Isomers: Compounds of formula I in optically pure form can be obtained from the corresponding racemates according to well-known procedures, e.g. HPLC with chiral matrix. Alternatively, optically pure starting materials can be used. Stereoisomeric mixtures, e.g. mixtures of diastereomers, can be separated into their corresponding isomers in a manner known per se by means of suitable separation methods. Diastereomeric mixtures for example may be separated into their individual diastereomers by means of fractionated crystallization, chromatography, solvent distribution, and similar procedures. This separation may take place either at the level of a starting compound or in a compound of formula I itself. Enantiomers may be separated through the formation of diastereomeric salts, for example by salt<br><br>
formation with an enantiomer-pure chiral acid, or by means of chromatography, for example by HPLC,-using chromatographic substrates with chiral ligands.<br>

The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active ingredients and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The term "a combined preparation", as used herein defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense that the first and second active ingredient as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the ingredients, i.e., simultaneously or at different time points. The parts of the kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts. Very preferably, the time intervals are chosen such that the effect on the treated disease in the combined use of the parts is larger than the effect which would be obtained by use of only any one of the active ingredients. The ratio of the total amounts of the active ingredient 1 to the active ingredient 2 to be administered in the combined preparation can be varied, e.g., in order to cope with the needs of a patient sub-population to be treated or the needs of the single patient which different needs can be due to age, sex, body weight, etc. of the patients. Preferably, there is at least one beneficial effect, e.g., a mutual enhancing of the effect of the first and second active ingredient, in particular a synergism, e.g. a more than additive effect, additional advantageous effects, less side effects, a combined therapeutical effect in a non-effective dosage of one or both of the first and second active ingredient, and especially a strong synergism the first and second active ingredient.<br>
It will be understood that in the discussion of methods, references to the active ingredients are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. If these active ingredients have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The active ingredients having an acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. The active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be used in form of a hydrate or include other solvents used for crystallization.<br>
A pharmaceutical combination which comprises two anti-epileptics selected from the list consisting of barbiturates and derivatives thereof, benzodiazepines, carboxamides, hydantoins, succinimides, valproic acid and other fatty acid derivates, AMPA antagonists and other anti-epileptic drugs, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, if at least one salt-forming group is present, will be referred to hereinafter as a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Surprisingly, the administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect or in other surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side effects, compared to a<br>
monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be evidenced in   • preclinical studies known as such, e.g. the Audiogenic Seizure Test or the methods described in the Examples.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with epilepsy. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on epilepsy can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotherapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
A further benefit is that lower doses of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of epilepsy which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
Very preferred is a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION comprising as active ingredients two anti-epileptic drugs, wherein a first anti-epileptic is selected from carboxamides, especially carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, 10-hydroxy-10,11-dihydrocarbamazepine, a compound of formula II wherein R1' represents acetoxy, tiagabine hydrochloride monohydrate, phenobarbital, levetiracetam, pregabaline, brivaracetam and lamotrigine, and a second anti-epileptic is an AMPA antagonist.<br>
It is one objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against epilepsy, comprising at least two anti-epileptics or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including Man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. The preferred route of administration of the dosage forms of the present invention is orally.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 10% to about 100%, preferably from about 20% to about 60%, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se,<br>
for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols, or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of epilepsy.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having epilepsy comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against epilepsy and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of epilepsy.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of diseases according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a prodrug of an active ingredient that convert in vivo to the active ingredient. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is used for the treatment of treatment of epilepsy which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the active ingredients employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of<br>
administration, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen for the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to iargel sites. This, involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>

Methylphenidate is the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication for children in the United States, primarily for the treatment of children diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), and thus, is widely available. Methylphenidate is described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
2,838,519 and 2,957,880. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,922,736; 5,908,850; 5,773,478; 6,113,879 describe administering d-threo methylphenidate to treat nervous system disorders. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,100,401; 6,121,453; and 6,162,919 describe processes for preparing substantially the single enantiomer d-threo methylphenidate. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,874,090 and 5,837,284 describe sustained release formulations of methylphenidate. All these citations are included herein by reference.<br>
Topiramate can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Topamax™. The compounds of formula I as well as their production process and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are known e%g. from  WO 98/17672.<br>
The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names and their preparation may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" (e.g.M. J. O'Neil et al., ed., "The Merck Index', 13th ed., Merck Research Laboratories, 2001) or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active ingredients and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The term "a combined preparation", as used herein defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense that the first and second active ingredient as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the ingredients, i.e., simultaneously or at different time points. The parts of the kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts. Very preferably, the time intervals are chosen such that the effect on the treated disease in the combined use of the parts is larger than the effect which would be obtained by use of only any one of the active ingredients. The ratio of the total amounts of the active ingredient 1 to the active ingredient 2 to be administered in the combined preparation can be varied, e.g., in order to cope with the needs of a patient sub-population to be treated or the needs of the single patient which different needs can be due to age, sex, body weight, etc. of the patients. Preferably, there is at least one beneficial effect, e.g., a mutual enhancing of the effect of the first and second active ingredient, in particular a synergism, e.g. a more than additive effect, additional advantageous effects, less side effects, a combined therapeutic effect in a non-effective dosage of one or both of the first and second active ingredient, and especially a strong synergism the first and second active ingredient.<br>
It will be understood that in the discussion of methods, references to the active ingredients are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. If these active ingredients have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The active ingredients having an acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. The active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be used in form of a hydrate or include other solvents used for crystallization.<br>
A. pharmaceutical combination which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one compound se'ected from the group consisting of lithium, valproic acid sodium salt, conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, lamotrigine, methylphenidate and antidepressants, in which the active ingredients are present in each<br>
case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, if at least one salt-forming group is present, will be referred to hereinafter as a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Surprisingly, the administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect or in other surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side effects, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The activity of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in the treatment of affective disorders is evidenced, for example, in the preclinical tests suitable for detecting drugs reversing psycho-motor stimulatory effects.<br>
Test 1 : NMDA-antagonist induced locomotion:<br>
Male rats are used. In principle 8 treatment groups are formed:<br>
1)	AMPA receptor antagonist followed by solvent 2 and solvent 3 to study the effects of the AMPA receptor<br>
antagonist on locomotor activity.<br>
2)	Solvent 1, combination partner and solvent 3 to study the effects of the combination partner on locomotor<br>
activity.<br>
3)	Solvent 1, solvent 2, followed by the competitive NMDA receptor antagonist (S)-2-amino-3-(2'-chloro-5-<br>
phosphonomethyl-biphenyl-3-yl)-propionic acid, hereinafter SDZ 220-581 (10 mg/kg) to study the induction of<br>
hyperlocomotor activity.<br>
4)	AMPA receptor antagonist followed by solvent 2 and SDZ 220-581.<br>
5)	Solvent 1 followed by combination partner and SDZ 220-581.<br>
6)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (doses of each active ingredient at doses close to threshold)<br>
followed by solvent 3.<br>
7)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (doses of each active ingredient at doses close to threshold)<br>
followed by SDZ 220-581 (10 mg/kg).<br>
8)	Solvent 1 - solvent 2 - solvent 3.<br>
Rats are randomly allocated to these pretreatment groups (n=10 / dose group). Drugs are administered subcutaneous (s.c.), 15 min prior to SDZ 220-581. Immediately after the animals received SDZ 220-581, they are placed into the activity monitor for a period of 60 min. Locomotor activity is analysed over the initial 30 minutes.<br>
Locomotion is recorded with a videotracking system. Animals are on a normal 12/12 h day-night cycle, with light on at 06:00 H. Experiments are performed in a dimly lit room between 07:00 H and 15:00 H. Animals are placed in a round arena (diameter 42 cm, height 32 cm) made of grey polyvinylchloride plastic.<br>
Test 2: NMDA-channel blocker induced head swaying and circling:<br>
Adult male rats are used. The animals are randomized to the following treatment groups (n= 10 per group):<br>
1)	AMPA receptor antagonist (t = -15 min) followed by solvent 2 (t = -15 min) and solvent 3 (t = 0 min) to study<br>
whether head swaying and circling is induced by the AMPA receptor antagonist given alone.<br>
2)	Solvent. 1 (t = -15 min), combination partner (t = -15 min) and solvent 3 (t = 0 min) to study whether head<br>
swaying and circling is induced by the combination partner given alone.<br>
3)	Solvent 1 (t = -15 min), solvent 2 (t = -15 min), followed by phencyclidine (PCP; an NMDA channel blocker,<br>
dosed 3 and 10 mg/kg, t = 0 min) to induce circling and head swaying.<br>
4)	AMPA receptor antagonist (t = -15 min) followed by solvent 2 (t = -15 min) and PCP (t = 0 min).<br>
5)	Solvent 1 (t = -15 min) followed by combination partner (t = -15 min) and PCP (t = 0 min).<br>
6)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (doses of each active ingredients at doses close to threshold (t = -<br>
15 min)) followed by solvent 3 (t = 0 min).<br>
7)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (doses of each active ingredients at doses close to threshold (t - -<br>
15 min)) followed by PCP (3 and 10 mg/kg, t = 0 min).<br>
8)	Solvent 1 (t = -15 min), solvent 2 (t = -15 min), solvent 3 (t = 0 min).<br>
COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (at t = -15 min) and PCP (at t = 0 min) are administered s.c. in a volume of 1 mL/kg. Video-recordings of the animals behavior over the period 0-30 min following PCP are scored by an observer who is unaware about the animals pretreatment. Head-swaying (rocking the head repeatedly by at least 2 cm left and right) and circling (turning around by using the forepaws, whereas the hindpaws remain more or less on the original position) are scored as present (1) or absent (0), every five minutes for the duration of 1 min. The scores for individual animals is summed and group scores used for statistical analysis (t-test with Bonferroni correction).<br>
NMDA-antagonist induced locomotor responses reflect a psychosis / mania-like state. Blockade of this activity indicates an anti-psychotic, anti-manic activity. Furthermore, enhancement of head-swaying and circling suggest a behavioral disinhibition (= anxiolytic-/antidepressant- like) and sociotropic activity. Therefore, the compounds are useful in the treatment of affective disorders including bipolar disorders, e.g. manic-depressive psychoses, extreme psychotic states e.g. mania with psychotic feature and excessive mood swings where behavioral stabilization is desired. In addition, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are indicated in ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorders) and other attention disorders, e.g. autism, and as well as those behavioral states characterized by social withdrawal e.g. negative symptoms.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may also be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with affective and attention disorders. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on affective and attention disorders can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotherapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
A further benefit is that lower doses of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of affective and attention disorders which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
It is one objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against affective and attention disorders, comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist,<br>
at least one compound selected from the group consisting of lithium, valproic acid sodium salt, conventional antipsychotics, atypical antipsychotics, lamotrigine, methylphenidate and antidepressants and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. The preferred route of administration of the dosage forms of the present invention is orally.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 10% to about 100%, preferably from about 20% to about 60%, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oraf solid preparations such as. for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are   . obviously employed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of affective and attention disorders.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having affective and attention disorders comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against affective and attention disorders and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of affective and attention disorders.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be "<br>
administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of affective and attention disorders according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during ihe course uf Ihei apy 01 concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of an active ingredient that convert in vivo to the active ingredient. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is used for the treatment of affective and attention disorders which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the active ingredients employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen for the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information-provided on the packet leaflet of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise.

The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS    ' World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active ingredients and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The term "a combined preparation", as used herein defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense that the first and second active ingredient as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the ingredients, i.e., simultaneously or at different time points. The parts of the kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts. Very preferably, the time intervals are chosen such that the effect on the treated disease in the combined use of the parts is larger than the effect which would be obtained by use of only any one of the active ingredients. The ratio of the total amounts of the active ingredient 1 to the active ingredient 2 to be administered in the combined preparation can be varied, e.g., in order to cope with the needs of a patient sub-population to be treated or the needs of the single patient which different needs can be due to age, sex, body weight, etc. of the patients. Preferably, there is at least one beneficial effect, e.g., a mutual enhancing of the effect of the first and second active ingredient, in particular a synergism, e.g. a more than additive effect, additional advantageous effects, less side effects, a combined therapeutical effect in a non-effective dosage of one or both of the first and second active ingredient, and especially a strong synergism the first and second active ingredient.<br>
It will be understood that in the discussion of methods, references to the active ingredients are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. If these active ingredients have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The. active ingredients having an acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. The active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be used in form of a hydrate or include other solvents used for crystallization.<br>
A pharmaceutical combination which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of benzodiazepines, SSRIs, SNRIs, buspirone and pregabalin in which the active<br>
ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, if at least one salt-forming group is present, will be referred to hereinafter as a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Surprisingly, the administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect or in other surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side effects, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in the treatment of anxiety symptomatologies is evidenced, for example, in preclinical studies known as such, e.g. the stress induced hypothermia model.<br>
The following Example serves to illustrate the invention without limiting the invention in its scope.<br>
Male mice are used. Treated animals were placed in their home cage for 1 h. This time interval may depend on the combination partner and may therefore be longer or shorter. After this pretreatment time, the core body temperature is measured using a rectal probe. Subsequently, the animal is placed back in the cage and the measurement is repeated after 15 min. The first rectal measurement including handling is a stressful situation for the animal which causes the body temperature to rise. Anxiolytic compounds are known to prevent the increase in core body temperature in response to the first measurement. In principle 4 treatment groups are formed:<br>
1)	Solvent followed by solvent.<br>
2)	Solvent pretreatment followed by the combination partner.<br>
3)	AMPA receptor antagonist followed by solvent.<br>
4)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (low doses of each active ingredients)<br>
Mice are randomly allocated to these pretreatment groups (n=10 / dose group). Drugs are administered subcutaneous (s.c.) or orally (p.o.) at doses close to threshold when administered alone.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, also be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotherapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
A further benefit is that lower doses of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of<br>
anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
It is one objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies, comprising at least one AMPA receptor antagonist, at least one compound selected from the group consisting of benzodiazepines, selective serotonin reuplakc inhibitors (SSRIs), selective serotonin and norcpincphrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), buspirone and pregabalin and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including humans, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. The preferred route of administration of the dosage forms of the present invention is orally.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 10% to about 100%, preferably from about 20% to about 60%, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having anxiety modelled in a particular paradigm comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying<br>
anxiety symptomatologies and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of an active ingredient that convert in vivo to the active ingredient. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is used for the treatment of anxiety or other psychiatric disorders with underlying anxiety symptomatologies which are refractory to monotherapy.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the active ingredients employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information provided on the packet leaflet of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise. In particular,<br>
Topiramate may be administered to an adult patient in a total daily dosage of between about 250 to about 500 mg. Buspirone may be administered in a total daily dosage of between about 15 to about 60 mg.<br>
Clonazepam may be administered to an adult patient in a total daily dosage between about 3 to about 8 mg and to a<br>
paediatric patient in a total daily dosage between about 0.5 to about 3 mg, split into three of four separate units.<br>
Diazepam may be administered to an adult patient in a total daily dosage between about 5 to about 10 mg and to a<br>
paediatric patient in a total daily dosage between about 5 to about 10 mg.<br>
Lorazepam may be administered to an adult patient in a total daily dosage between about. 0.044 mg/kg body weight<br>
to about 0.05 mg/kg body weight.<br>
Citalopram may be administered in a total daily dosage of between about 20 to about 60 rag.<br>
Paroxetine may be administered in a total daily dosage of between about 20 to about 50 mg.<br>
Venlafaxine may be administered in a total daily dosage of between about 70 to about 150 mg.<br>
{[(7-Nitro-2,3-dioxo-l ,2,3,4-tetrahydro-quinoxalin-5-ylmethyl)-amino]-methyl }-phosphonic acid may be<br>
administered to a patient in a total daily dosage of about 60 to about 400 mg.<br>
Combinations for myopia<br>
The present invention also relates to combinations suitable for the treatment of ocular disorders, in particular myopia.<br>
Myopia (nearsightedness) is an error of visual focusing that makes distant objects appear blurred. A nearsighted person can easily read the Jaeger eye chart (the chart for near reading), but finds the Snellen eye chart (the chart for distance) difficult to read. This blurred vision occurs when the physical length of the eye is greater than the optical length. For this reason, nearsightedness often develops in the rapidly growing school-aged child or teenager, and progresses during the growth years, requiring frequent changes in glasses or contact lenses. It usually stops progressing as growth is completed in the early twenties. Nearsightedness affects males and females equally, and those with a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Nearsightedness can often be compensated for by the use of eyeglasses or contact lenses, which shift the focus point to the retina. Furthermore, there are several surgical procedures that reshape the cornea, shifting the focus point from in front of the retina to the retina. Most eyes with nearsightedness are entirely healthy, but a small number of people with myopia develop a form of retinal degeneration.<br>
Surprisingly, the effect of a combination which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one least one compound selected from the group consisting of pirenzepine, telenzepine, ortho-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and GABA agonists is greater than the additive effect of the combined drugs. Furthermore, the combinations disclosed herein can be used to treat myopia which is refractory to monotherapy employing one of the combination partners alone.<br>
Hence, the invention relates to a combination, such as a combined preparation or pharmaceutical composition, which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of pirenzepine, telenzepine, ortho-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and GABA agonists, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt and optionally at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; for simultaneous," separate or sequential use.<br>
Topiramate can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Topamax™. The compounds of formula I as well as their production process and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are known e.g. from WO 98/17672.<br>
Pirenzepine, telenzepine and ortho-methoxy-sila-hexocyclium can be applied as described in US 5,122,522.<br>
The term "gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and GABA agonists" as used herein includes, but is not limited to the compounds disclosed in WO03/032975.<br>
The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium 'The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications).

Surprisingly, the administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect or in other surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side effects, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be evidenced in preclinical studies known as such, e.g. the methods described herein.<br>
The activity against myopia of the compounds is, e.g., indicated in standard tests, e.g. in the model according to R.A. Stone et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (USA) 86,704-706 (1989)] wherein experimental myopia is produced in chicken, on administration of about 0.1 to about 1 mg/kg of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in eye drops.<br>
Furthermore, the pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with myopia. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION.

This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of myopia which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the AMPA receptor antagonists used in the present invention are competitive AMPA receptor antagonists.<br>

In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION are preferably applied topically to the eye in ca. 0.002 to ca. 0.02% ophthalmologic solutions. The ophthalmic vehicle is such that the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is maintained in contact with the ocular surface for a sufficient time period to allow the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION to penetrate the corneal and internal regions of the eye. The pharmaceutically acceptable ophthalmic vehicle may be e.g. an ointment, vegetable oil, or encapsulating material.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of myopia.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having myopia comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against myopia and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>

Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of myopia.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of myopia according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein.

The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium 'The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active ingredients and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The term "a combined preparation", as used herein defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense that the first and second active ingredient as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the ingredients, i.e., simultaneously or at different time points. The parts of the kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts. Very preferably, the time intervals are chosen such<br>
that the effect on the treated disease in the combined use of the parts is larger than the effect which would be obtained by use of only any one of the active ingredients. The ratio of the total amounts of the active ingredient 1 to the active ingredient 2 to be administered in the combined preparation can be varied, e.g., in order to cope with the needs of a patient sub-population to be treated or the needs of the single patient which different needs can be due to age, sex, body weight, etc. of the patients. Preferably, there is at least one beneficial effect, e.g., a mutual enhancing of the effect of the first and second active ingredient, in particular a synergism, e.g. a more than additive effect, additional advantageous effects, less side effects, a combined therapeutically effect in a non-effective dosage of one or both of the first and second active ingredient, and especially a strong synergism the first and second active ingredient.<br>
It will be understood that in the discussion of methods, references to the active ingredients are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. If these active ingredients have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The active ingredients having an acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. The active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be used in form of a hydrate or include other solvents used for crystallization.<br>
A pharmaceutical combination which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one combination partner selected from the group consisting of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, vanilloid receptor antagonists, opioids, tricydic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cathepsin S inhibitors and GABAB receptor agonists, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, if at least one salt-forming group is present, will be referred to hereinafter as a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Surprisingly, the administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect or in other surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side effects, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be evidenced in preclinical studies known as such, e.g. the methods described in the Examples.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with pain. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on pain can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotlierapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
A further benefit is that lower doses of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the<br>
patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of pain which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the AMPA receptor antagonists used in the present invention are competitive AMPA receptor antagonists.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the AMPA receptor antagonists is selected from EGIS 8332 (7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzodiazepine-8-carbonitrile), GYKI47261 4-(7-chloro-2-methyl-4H-3,10,1 Oa-triaza-benzo[f]azulen-9- yl)-phenylamine), irampanel (BIIR 561; N,N-dimethyl-2-[2-(3-phenyl-l,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)phenoxy]ethanamine), KRP 199 (7-[4-[[[[(4-carboxyphenyI)-amino]carbonyl]oxy]methyl]-lH-imidazol-l-yl]-3,4-dihydro-3-0X0-6-(trifluoromethyl)-2-quinoxalinecarboxylic acid), NS 1209 (2-[[[5-[4-[(dimethylamino)-sulfonyl]phenyl]-l,2,6,7,8,9-hexahydro-8-methyl-2-oxo-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-h]isoquinolin-3-ylidene]amino]oxy]-4-hydroxybutanoic acid monosodium salt, e.g. prepared as described in WO 98/14447), topiramate (TOPAMAX, 2,3:4,5-bis-O-(l-methylethylidene)-beta-D-fructopyranose sulfamate, preparation, e.g. as described in US 535475), talampanel (LY-300164, (R)-7-acetyl-5-(4-aminophenyl)-8,9-dihydro-8-methyl-7H-l,3-dioxolo[4,5-h][2,3]benzo-diazepine, preparation, e.g. as described in EP 492485), YM90K (6-imidazol-1 -yl-7-nitro-1,4-dihydro-quinoxaline-2,3-dione), S-34730 (7-chloro-6-sulfamoyl-2-( 1H)-quinolinone-3-phosphonic acid), Zonampanel (YM-872; (7-imidazoI-l-yl-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoxalin-l-yl)-acetic acid), GYKI-52466 (4-(8-methyl-9H-l ,3-dioxa-6,7-diaza-cyclohepta[f]inden-5-yl)-phenylamine), ZK-200775 (MPQX, (7-morpholin-4-yl-2,3-dioxo-6-trifluoromethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-quinoxalin-1 -ylmethyl)-phospbonic acid), CP-465022 (3-(2-chloro-phenyl)-2-[2-(6-diethylaminomethyl-pyridin-2-yl)-vinyl]-6-fluoro-3H-quinazolin-4-one), SYM-2189 (4-(4-amino-phenyl)-6-methoxy-1 -methyl-1H-phthalazine-2-carboxylic acid propylamide), SYM-2206 (8-(4-amino-phenyl)-5-rnethyl-5H-[l,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]phthalazine-6-carboxylic acid propylamide, RPR-117824 ((4-oxo-2-phosphono-5,10-dihydro-4H-imidazo[l,2-a]indeno[ 1,2-e]pyrazin-9-yl)-acetic acid), LY-293558 (6-[2-(lH-tetrazol-5-yl)-ethyl]-decahydro-isoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid), and l,2,3,4-tetrahydro-7-nitro-2,3-dioxo-5-quinoxalinyl)methyl]amino]methyl]phosphonic acid dehydrate.<br>
It is one objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against pain, comprising at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one combination partner selected from the group consisting of cyclooxygenase inhibitors, vanilloid receptor antagonists, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, cathepsin S inhibitors and GABAB receptor agonists, and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are   • those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. The preferred route of administration of the dosage forms of the present invention is orally.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 10% to about 100%, preferably from about 20% to about 60%, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of pain.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having pain comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against pain and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of pain.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of pain according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of an active ingredient that convert in vivo to the active ingredient. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is used for the treatment of pain which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the active ingredients employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance will) a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information provided on the packet leaflet of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise. In particular,<br>
Topiramate may be administered to an adult patient in a total daily dosage of between about 250 to about 500 mg.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a preclinical model such as the " Chronic neuropathic pain model": Wistar rats are anaesthetised with enflurane and a small incision is made mid-way up one thigh to expose the sciatic nerve. The nerve is cleared of connective tissue and tightly ligated so that the dorsal 1/3 to 1/2 of the nerve thickness is held within the ligature. The muscle and skin are closed with sutures and clips and the wound dusted with antibiotic powder. This procedure produces a mechanical hyperalgesia which develops within 2-3 days and is maintained for at least 4 weeks. Mechanical hyperalgesia is assessed by measuring paw withdrawal thresholds on both the ipsilateral (ligated) and contralateral (unligated) hindpaw to an increasing pressure stimulus applied to the paw using an analgesymeter (Ugo-Basile) with a wedge-shaped probe (area 1.75 mm2) and a cut-off threshold of 250 g. The end point is taken as the first sign of pain response (struggling, vocalisation or paw withdrawal). Hyperalgesia is indicated by the difference in ipsilateral and contralateral withdrawal thresholds. Reversal of established hyperalgesia by administered compounds is measured 12-14 days following surgery, using 6 animals per treatment group. In principal 4 treatment groups are formed:<br>
1)	Solvent followed by solvent.<br>
2)	Solvent pretreatment followed by the combination partner.<br>
3)	AMPA receptor antagonist followed by solvent.<br>
4)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (low doses of each active ingredients).<br>
Paw withdrawal thresholds are measured prior to and then up to 6 hours following drug or solvent administration. Statistical analysis is carried out on withdrawal threshold readings using ANOVA followed by Tukey's HSD test comparing drug treated and time-matched vehicle treated animals.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information provided on the packet leaflet of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise.<br>
Combinations for schizophrenia<br>
The present invention also relates to combinations suitable for the treatment of psychiatric/neurological disorders, in particular schizophrenia.<br>

followed by solvent 3.<br>
7)	The COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION (doses of each active ingredients at doses close to threshold)<br>
followed by amphetamine.<br>
8)	Solvent 1 - solvent 2 - solvent 3.<br>
Rats are randomly allocated to these pretreatment groups (n=10 / dose group). Drugs are administered subcutaneous (s.c.), 15 min prior to SDZ 220-581. Immediately after the animals received amphetamine, they are placed into the activity monitor for a period of 60 min. Locomotor activity is analysed over the initial 30 minutes.<br>
Threshold doses of each active ingredient of the combination partners are used. Amphetamine is dosed at 1 mg/kg s.c. Locomotion is recorded with a videotracking system. Animals are on a normal 12/12 h. day-night cycle, with light on at 06:00 H. Experiments are performed in a dimly lit room between 07:00 H and 15:00 H. Animals are placed in a round arena (diameter 42 cm, height 32 cm) made of grey polyvinylchloride plastic. The camera is placed such, that four animals (one per arena) can be recorded simultaneously.<br>
Comparison between groups is done with Student's t-test, corrected for multiple testing using the Bonferroni procedure.<br>
Furthermore, the pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with schizophrenia. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on schizophrenia can be determined directly<br>
through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotherapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION provide, in particular, benefits in the treatment of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, mood symptoms and/or cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and/or psychosis. Furthermore, some of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION show beneficial effects in the control of impulsive and/or violent behavior of schizophrenic patients.<br>
A further benefit is that lower doses of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of schizophrenia which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
It is one objective of this invention to provide a pharmaceutical composition comprising a quantity, which is jointly therapeutically effective against schizophrenia, comprises at least one AMPA antagonist/at least one compound selected from the group specified above and at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
Tne pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including humans, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. The preferred route of administration of the dosage forms of the present invention is orally.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 10 % to about 100 %, preferably from about 20 % to about 60 %, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having schizophrenia comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against schizophrenia and in which the compounds tan also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of schizophrenia according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of an active ingredient that convert in vivo to the active ingredient. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is used for the treatment of treatment of schizophrenia which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the active ingredients employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION muy vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information<br>

Combinations for tinnitus<br>
The present invention also relates to combinations suitable for the treatment of neurological disorders, in particular tinnitus.<br>
Tinnitus is the medical term for roaring, buzzing, clicking, whistling, hissing, or high pitched ringing in the ears or inside the head. Tinnitus may be constant or occur intermittently in one or both ears. Although there are many theories about how tinnitus occurs, there is no scientific consensus to its origin. Some causes of tinnitus result from a blow to the head, large doses of aspirin, anemia, noise exposure, stress, impacted wax, hypertension and certain types of medications and tumors.<br>
Surprisingly, the effect of a combination which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, vasodilators, zinc salts and anesthetics is greater than the additive effect of the combined drugs. Furthermore, the combinations disclosed herein can be used to treat tinnitus which is refractory to monotherapy employing one of the combination partners alone.<br>
Hence, the invention relates to a combination, such as a combined preparation or pharmaceutical composition, which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, vasodilators, zinc salts and anesthetics, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and optionally at least one pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; for simultaneous, separate or sequential use.<br>
The term "anti-anxiety drug" as used herein includes, but is not limited to alprazolam.<br>
The term "antidepressants" as used herein includes, but is not limited to nortriptyline (N-methyl-3-(10,l 1-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-yliden)propylamine).<br>
The term "anticonvulsants" as used herein includes, but is not limited to oxcarbazepine. The term "anesthetics" as used herein includes, but is not limited to lidocaine. The term "vasodilators" as used herein includes, but is not limited to pentoxifylline. The term "zinc salts" as used herein includes, but is not limited to zinc sulfate.<br>
Topiramate can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Topamax™. The compounds of formula I as well as their production process and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are known, e.g., from WO 98/17672. Alprazolam can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Xanax™. Nortriptyline can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Nortrilen™. Oxcarbazepine can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Trileptal™. Lidocaine can be administered in the form of its hydrochloride, e.g., in the form as marketed as injection solution, e.g. under the trademark Heweneural™.<br>
zinc sulfate can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Zink-Sandoz™. Pentoxifyllin can be administered, e.g., in the form as marketed, e.g. under the trademark Trental™.<br>
The structure of the active ingredients identified by code nos., generic or trade names may be taken from the actual edition of the standard compendium "The Merck Index" or from databases, e.g. Patents International (e.g. IMS World Publications). The corresponding content thereof is hereby incorporated by reference. Any person skilled in the art is fully enabled to identify the active ingredients and, based on these references, likewise enabled to manufacture and test the pharmaceutical indications and properties in standard test models, both in vitro and in vivo.<br>
The term "a combined preparation", as used herein defines especially a "kit of parts" in the sense that the first and second active ingredient as defined above can be dosed independently or by use of different fixed combinations with distinguished amounts of the ingredients, i.e., simultaneously or at different time points. The parts of the kit of parts can then, e.g., be administered simultaneously or chronologically staggered, that is at different time points and with equal or different time intervals for any part of the kit of parts. Very preferably, the time intervals are chosen such that the effect on the treated disease in the combined use of the parts is larger than the effect which would be obtained by use of only any one of the active ingredients. The ratio of the total amounts of the active ingredient 1 to the active ingredient 2 to be administered in the combined preparation can be varied, e.g., in order to cope with the needs of a patient sub-population to be treated or the needs of the single patient which different needs can be due to age, sex, body weight, etc. of the patients. Preferably, there is at least one beneficial effect, e.g., a mutual enhancing of the effect of the first and second active ingredient, in particular a synergism, e.g. a more than additive effect, additional advantageous effects, less side effects, a combined therapeutically effect in a non-effective dosage of one or both of the first and second active ingredient, and especially a strong synergism the first and second active ingredient.<br>
It will be understood that in the discussion of methods, references to the active ingredients are meant to also include the pharmaceutically acceptable salts. If these active ingredients have, for example, at least one basic center, they can form acid addition salts. Corresponding acid addition salts can also be formed having, if desired, an additionally present basic center. The active ingredients having an acid group (for example COOH) can also form salts with bases. The active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may also be used in form of a hydrate or include other solvents used for crystallization.<br>
A pharmaceutical combination which comprises at least one AMPA receptor antagonist and at least one compound selected from the group consisting of anti-anxiety drugs, antidepressants, antihistamines, anticonvulsants, vasodilators, zinc salts and anesthetics, in which the active ingredients are present in each case in free form or in the<br>
form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, if at least one salt-forming group is present, will be referred to hereinafter as a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Surprisingly, the administration of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION results in a beneficial, especially a synergistic, therapeutic effect or in other surprising beneficial effects, e.g. less side effects, compared to a monotherapy applying only one of the pharmaceutically active ingredients used in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
The pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be evidenced in preclinical studies known as such, e.g., the methods described herein.<br>
The activity in tinnitus of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be shown in standard tests, e.g. in the salicylate-induced tinnitus model.<br>
It has been demonstrated [C.A. Bauer et al., Hearing Research 147 (2000) 175-182] that chronic salicylate exposure causes upregulation of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) expression in the rat inferior colliculus (1C), associated with the development of tinnitus.<br>
Furthermore, electrophysiological recordings from auditory neurons using patch clamp recording techniques [D. Peruzzi et al. Neuroscience 101 (2000) 403-416, X. Lin et al., Journal of Neurophysiology 79 (1998) 2503-2512] and single neuron recordings [J.J. Eggermont and M. Kenmochi, Hearing Research 117 (1998) 149-160] showed that the excitability of neurons is changed following salicylate and quinine treatment.<br>
Administration of salicylate or quinine caused an increase in the firing rate auditory neurons measured by extracellular electrophysiological recording techniques. Using in vitro electrophysiological recording techniques superfusion with salicylate increases the excitability of the recorded neurons. On administration of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION at concentrations of about InM to 100 µM, the effects of salicylate were reversed.<br>
Furthermore, the pharmacological activity of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may, for example, be demonstrated in a clinical study. Such clinical studies are preferably randomized, double-blind, clinical studies in patients with tinnitus. Such studies demonstrate, in particular, the synergism of the active ingredients of the COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION. The beneficial effects on tinnitus.can be determined directly through the results of these studies or by changes in the study design which are known as such to a person skilled in the art. The studies are, in particular, suitable to compare the effects of a monotherapy using the active ingredients and a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION.<br>
A further benefit is that lower doses of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be used, for example, that the dosages need not only often be smaller but are also applied less frequently, or can be used in order to diminish the incidence of side effects. This is in accordance with the desires and requirements of the patients to be treated. The COMBINATIONS OF THE INVENTION can be used, in particular, for the treatment of tinnitus which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>

If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.<br>
Unit dosage forms may contain, for example, from about 2.5 mg to about 500 mg of the active ingredients.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of tinnitus.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having tinnitus_comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against tinnitus and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of tinnitus.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately 01 as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of tinnitus according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein.

In this composition, the first and second active ingredient can be administered together, one after the other or separately in one combined unit dosage form or in two separate unit dosage forms. The unit dosage form may also be a fixed combination.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention can be prepared in a manner known per se and are those suitable for enteral, such as oral or rectal, and parenteral administration to mammals (warm-blooded animals), including man, comprising a therapeutically effective amount of at least one pharmacologically active ingredient, alone or in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carries, especially suitable for enteral or parenteral application. The preferred route of administration of the dosage forms of the present invention is orally.<br>
The novel pharmaceutical composition contain, for example, from about 10 % to about 100 %, preferably from   • about 20 % to about 60 %, of the active ingredients. Pharmaceutical preparations for the combination therapy for enteral or parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dosage forms, such as sugar-coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and furthermore ampoules. If not indicated otherwise, these are prepared in a manner known per se, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, sugar-coating, dissolving or lyophilizing processes. It will be appreciated that the unit content of active ingredient or ingredients contained in an individual dose of each dosage form need not in itself constitute an effective amount since the necessary effective amount can be reached by administration of a plurality of dosage units.<br>
In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils or alcohols; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcristalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention relates to the use of a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of dementia.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides a method of treating a warm-blooded animal having dementia comprising administering to the animal a COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION in a quantity which is jointly therapeutically effective against dementia and in which the compounds can also be present in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts.<br>
Moreover, the present invention provides a commercial package comprising as active ingredients COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION, together with instructions for simultaneous, separate or sequential use thereof in the treatment of dementia.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is used for the treatment of dementia which is refractory to monotherapy.<br>
In particular, a therapeutically effective amount of each of the active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may be administered simultaneously or sequentially and in any order, and the components may be administered separately or as a fixed combination. For example, the method of treatment of dementia according to the invention may comprise (i) administration of the first active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form and (ii) administration of the second active ingredient in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, simultaneously or sequentially in any order, in jointly therapeutically effective amounts, preferably in synergistically effective amounts, e.g. in daily dosages corresponding to the amounts described herein. The individual active ingredients of the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION can be administered separately at different times during the course of therapy or concurrently in divided or single combination forms. Furthermore, the term administering also encompasses the use of a pro-drug of an active ingredient that convert in vivo to the active ingredient. The instant invention is therefore to be understood as embracing all such regimes of simultaneous or alternating treatment and the term "administering" is to be interpreted accordingly.<br>
The effective dosage of each of the active ingredients employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION may vary depending on the particular compound or pharmaceutical composition employed, the mode of administration, the severity of the condition being treated. Thus, the dosage regimen the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION is selected in accordance with a variety of factors including the route of administration and the renal and hepatic function of the patient. A physician, clinician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the single active ingredients required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the condition. Optimal precision in achieving concentration of the active ingredients within the range that yields efficacy without toxicity requires a regimen based on the kinetics of the active ingredients' availability to target sites. This involves a consideration of the distribution, equilibrium, and elimination of the active ingredients.<br>
When the combination partners employed in the COMBINATION OF THE INVENTION are applied in the form as marketed single drugs, their dosage and mode of administration can take place in accordance with the information provided on the packet leaflet of the respective marketed drug in order to result in the beneficial effect described herein, if not mentioned herein otherwise.

AMPA-receptor binding<br>
This can be demonstrated in standard tests, e.g. the [3H] CNQX binding test (Honore et al. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989, 38: 3207-3212). This test is performed as follows:<br>
Brain membranes: The animals are decapitated, the brain removed and homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 10% sucrose with a glass/Teflon homogenizer at positions 5 for 30 sec. The membranes are centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min, and the supernatant centrifuged at 20,000 x g for 15 min. The resulting pellet is resuspended in 10 volumes of cold water with a tissue homogenizer (Brinkman Polytron) at position 5 for 15 sec and the suspension centrifuged at 8000 x g for 10 min. The supernatant including the buffy layer is centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 20 min, the pellet resuspended in 5 volumes of water and the suspension frozen (20-30 min in dry ice/MeOH) and thawed<br>
(water-bath at 37°C) twice. The suspension is centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 20 min, the pellet resuspended in 50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5, and centrifuged at 40,000 x g for 10 min. The final pellet is resuspended with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in 5 volumes of HEPES/KOH buffer; 2 mL aliquots are frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Pretreatment of membranes: Membranes are thawed at 35 °C and once washed with 50 mM HEPES/KOH by centrifugation at 39,000 x g for 10 min. The final pellet is resuspended with a glass/Teflon homogenizer in the same buffer.<br>
Radioligand binding assay: It is performed using 96-well miciotiteiplates in a volume of 0.3 mL of 50 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2,100 ug membrane protein, 5 nM [3H]-CNQX (NEN) and the compound to be tested. Incubation is performed at 4 °C for 40 min and the reaction is terminated by centrifugation (Sigma 4K10) at 3700 x g for 30 min. The pellet is washed once with cold buffer and then dissolved in 0.02 mL of the tissue solubilizer Soluene for 20 min. Two hundred uL of the scintillation fluid Microscint 20 (Packard) are added and the radioactivity is counted in a Packard Topcount scintillation counter at an efficiency of 40 - 45%. Nonspecific binding is defined by 10 uM CNQX. Assays are performed in triplicate. For example, in this assay the compound of Example 4 has an IC50 better than 1 uM.<br>
Functional Test for AMPA-receptor Activity<br>
For the determination of functional agonism or antagonism at the AMPA-receptor, experiments can be performed on Xenopus oocytes as previously described in detail (Urwyler et al., Mol Pharmacol. 2001,60, 963-971). Briefly, two electrode voltage clamp recordings are performed from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing GluR3 AMPA receptors. Plasmids for the rat GluR3-(flop) (Hollmann et al., Science 1991,252, 851-853) are linearized and transcribed into capped cRNA using an in vitro RNA synthesis kit (Ambion, Texas) with T7 Polymerase. Stock solutions are kept in 70% EtOH. Before use, cRNA is precipitated and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. Oocytes are injected with RNA coding the rat GluR3-(flop) AMPA receptor. For recordings, oocytes are placed in a perfusion chamber with continuous gravity flow of frog Ringer's solution. For recordings from oocytes expressing rGluR3-(flop) receptors frog, Ringer's solution containing Mg2+ (81 mM NaCl; 2.5 mM KC1; 1 mM CaCl2; 1 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM NaHC03, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) is used. Test compounds are washed in with gravity.<br>
For example, in this assay the compound of Example 4 is an antagonist at the rGluR3 AMPA receptor with an IC50-value better than 3 uM.<br>
Audiogenic Seizures Model<br>
For example the compounds of the invention have pronounced anticonvulsive properties which are determined in vivo, for example in mice, by reference to their pronounced protective action with respect to convulsions triggered by sound, electric shock or metrazole.<br>
Sound induced seizures were elicited in DBA/2 mice (Collins RL in: Experimental models of epilepsy, eds Pupura, Penry Tower, Woodbury Walter; Raven Press, New York, 1972). For testing, 20-day-old animals are placed in a sound attenuated chamber. Following a 60 s habituation period the animals are stimulated using band limited noise (14 - 20 kHz, 118 dB SPL) lasting for maximally 60 s. DBA/2 mice respond with a sequence of wild running, clonic seizures, tonic seizures, and respiratory arrest to the acoustic stimulus. For data analysis the occurrence as well as the duration of the different behavioural phases are measured. The ED50 values for the different behavioural phases are calculated. ED50 values following systemic drug applications (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, oral) range between 0.5 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg.<br>
In addition, the compounds of the invention show pronounced effects in the well established electric shock mouse model or the mouse model for metrazole-induced convulsions according to Schmutz et al, Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch Pharmacol 1990, 342, 61-66. ED50 values range between 1 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg.<br>
The antischizophrenic activity of the compounds of the invention can be demonstrated, e.g. in the amphetamine-induced hypcrlocomotion test. Blockade of amphetamine-induced hypei locomotion is well known as screening paradigm for antischizophrenic activity.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
