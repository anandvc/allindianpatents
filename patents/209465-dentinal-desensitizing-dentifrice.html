				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION <br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a desensitizing dentifrice composition which eliminates or reduces the discomfort and pain associated with dentinal hypersensitivity and more particularly to a desensitizing dental composition containing a potassium salt desensitizing agents which exhibits unexpected enhanced anticavity and remineralization properties.<br>
2. The Prior Art<br>
Dentinal hypersensitivity is defined as acute, localized tooth pain in response to physical stimulation of the dentine surface as by thermal (hot or cold) osmotic, tactile combination of thermal, osmotic and tactile stimulation of the exposed dentin.<br>
Exposure of the dentine, which is generally due to recession of the gums, or loss of enamel, frequently leads to hypersensitivity.   The art has determined that dentine tubules open to the surface have a high correlation with dentine hypersensitivity, Abs, J. Clin. Periodontal. 14,280-4 (1987). Dentinal tubules lead from the pulp to the cementum. When the surface cementum of the tooth root is eroded, the dentinal tubules become exposed to the external environment. The exposed dentinal tubules provide a pathway for transmission of fluid flow to the pulpal nerves, the transmission induced by changes in temperature, pressure and ionic gradients.<br>
It is known to the art that potassium salts are effective in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity. For example, U.S. 3,863,006 discloses that toothpastes containing potassium salts such as potassium nitrate desensitize the teeth after tooth brushing for several weeks. It is believed by those skilled in the art that an elevation in the extracellular potassium concentration in the vicinity of pulpal nerves underlying sensitive dentin is responsible for the therapeutic desensitizing effect of topically applied oral products which contain potassium nitrate. Due to passive diffusion of potassium ion into and out of the open dentine tubules, repeated application of the active ingredient is necessary to build up the necessary concentration in the vicinity of the pulpal nerves.<br>
It is believed that the improved pain relief is obtained from the use of potassium salts in combination with gradual mineralization on the dentin surface which can either totally or partially occlude dentin tubules. Total occlusion will dramatically reduce fluid flow within the tubules which stimulates pain. Partial occlusion of the dentin tubules is believed to increase delivery of potassium ion inside the tooth because the inward diffusive flux is less dependent upon tubule radius than outward fluid flow (due to positive pulpal pressures) (See DH Pashley and WG Mathews, Archs. Oral Biol. (1993) 38,577-582). Therefore, this enhanced delivery of potassium should enhance relief.<br>
It has also long been known to include fluoride releasing compounds in dentifrices as anticaries agents, and it has been established that these compounds are effective to reduce the incidence of dental caries. Fluoride compounds which are conventionally used are sodium fluoride, sodium monofluorophosphate and stannous fluoride. The fluoride compounds are effective mainly due to the fluoride ions which improve the acid resistance of tooth enamel and accelerate recalcification or remineralization of decayed teeth in their early stage when the demineralization has proceeded only slightly. By remineralization, pre-existing tooth decay and caries can be reduced or eliminated thereby reducing preexisting carious conditions in the tooth structure. The effect of improving the acid resistance of the enamel is believed to be due to the fact that the fluoride ions are incorporated into a crystal lattice of hydroxyapatite which is the main constituent of tooth enamel or, in other words, fluoride ions partially fluoridate hydroxyapatite and simultaneously repair the lattice irregularities.<br>
The effectiveness of fluoride treatment is dependent upon the amount of fluoride ion which is available for deposition on the enamel being treated. It is, therefore, desirable to formulate dentifrice compositions which provide maximum fluoride ion availability in brushing solutions formed using the dentifrice.<br>
While the prior art discloses the use of various oral compositions for the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity, dental caries, and enamel demineralization there is still a need for additional compositions and methods which provide improved performance in such treatments.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided an oral composition and method for the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity which exhibits improved anticavity and remineralization properties, the composition containing a fluoride ion releasing salt and a<br>
potassium releasable salt compound in an orally acceptable vehicle in which the fluoride compound is present at a concentration sufficient to release about 500 to 8800 parts per million (ppm) fluoride, the composition being buffered to maintain an alkaline pH of about 7.5 to about 9 whereby upon repeated application of the composition to the teeth increased relief from dentinal hypersensitivity is experienced by the user accompanied by improved resistance to cavities.<br>

In the first neutral pH component a fluoride ion source desensitizing agent and phosphate buffering agent is added.  In the second component an ingredient to adjust the pH to an alkaline level is added, such as sodium hydroxide. These ingredients are mixed until a homogenous phase is obtained for each component. Thereafter inorganic thickener, silica abrasive, flavor and surfactant ingredients are added and the ingredients mixed at high speed under vacuum of from about 20 to 100 mm of Hg. The resultant product, in the case of each component, is a homogeneous, semi-solid, extrudible paste product.<br>

The multicomponent dentifrice composition embodiment of the present invention is packaged in a suitable dispensing container in which the components are maintained physically separated and from which the separated components may be dispensed synchronously as a combined ribbon for application to a toothbrush. Such containers are known in the art. An example of such a container is a two compartment dispensing container, such as a pump or a tube, having collapsible sidewalls, as disclosed in U.S. Patents 4,487,757 and 4,687,663; wherein, the tube body is formed from a collapsible plastic web such as polyethylene or polypropylene and is provided with a partition within the container body defining separate compartments in which the physically separated components are stored and from which they are dispensed through a suitable dispensing outlet<br>
The following example is further illustrative of the present invention, but it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto. All amounts and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight, unless otherwise stated.<br>
Example I<br>
A two component (Component A and B) desensitizing dentifrice of the present invention was prepared, designated "Dentifrice X", Component A having neutral pH (6.5) and a Component B having an alkaline pH (9.5). When combined in equal amounts for tooth brushing, Dentifrice X had a pH of 7.5 in a 1:3 slurry with water. The ingredients of Components A and B are listed in Table I below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In the preparation of Dentifrice X, components A and B were prepared wherein the glycerin, polyethylene glycol and organic thickeners were dispersed in a conventional mixer until the mixture became a slurry, which was smooth in appearance. Color and sweetener were dispersed in this slurry before the addition of water. In the preparation of Component A, potassium nitrate was then dispersed in this slurry. In the preparation of Component B, sodium hydroxide was then dispensed in the gel phase. This mixture was mixed for 20 to 30 minutes producing a homogeneous gel phase. The mixture was added to a vacuum mixer and cooled below 105°F. Zeodent 115, Zeodent 165 and sodium bicarbonate were then added and mixed for 10 to 30 minutes at high speed under a vacuum of about 50 mm Hg, providing a homogenous mixture. The sodium lauryl sulfate and flavor were then added to the individual dentifrice components which was followed by mixing another 5-15 minutes under vacuum of 50 mm Hg to prepare the resultant component product.<br>
The desensitizing efficacy of the two component Dentifrice X was evaluated using 4,25mm X 4.25mm square dentin disks of 750µm thickness cut from extracted human molars. The disks were prepared for treatment by etching with 6% citric acid for 2 minutes to remove any surface smear.<br>
For purposes of comparison the procedure of the Example I was repeated with another group of similarly prepared disks using a dual component dentifrice designated "Dentifrice Y", comparable to that of US 6,180,089 in which the alkaline component designated "Component C" had a pH of 9.5 and the acidic component designated "Component D" had a pH of 5.2. The ingredients of Components C and D of Dentifrice Y are listed in Table n below.<br>
As a control, the procedure of the Example was repeated using a phosphate buffer solution as the treatment which treatment was designated "Control". The ingredients of the phosphate buffer solution are listed in Table III below.<br>
The ingredients of Components C and D of Dentifrice Y are listed in Table n below.<br>
TABLE II<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
*Releases 2200 ppm fluoride ion. Fluoride ion delivery of Dentifrice Y is 1100 ppm when Component C and D are combined for use.<br><br>
Ingredient<br><br>
TABLE III<br>
 (Table Removed)<br>
The etched disks were then treated by separately brushing the discs for a 60 second period with either Dentifrice X or Y or the phosphate buffer solution (control).<br>
The surface composition of the treated disks were then subjected to Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis. The ESCA results are recorded in Table IV below as an average for each group. The percentage of nitrogen on the dentin surface is generally attributed to the amount of exposed collagen material which is an integral part of the dentin structure. The reduced amount of nitrogen is indicative of a surface coating, and the higher the amount of calcium ion, the greater the degree of tubular occupation. Table IV<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results recorded in Table IV indicate that the amount of deposit formed on the surface of the dentin disks treated with the combined components of Dentifrice X of the present invention is substantially greater than the disks treated with comparative Dentifrice Y, indicating a significantly greater degree of tubular obturation would be experienced with the use of Dentifrice X as compared to Dentifrice Y.<br>
The SEM photomicrographs taken of the dentin surfaces subjected to the brushing treatments are shown in Figures 1-3 respectively. Examination of the SEM of the Dentifrice X treated dentin disk surface, (Figure 1), indicates that dentinal tubule obturation was substantially complete as compared to treatment with comparative dual component Dentifrice Y as indicated by examination of the photomicrograph of Fig. 2, The Control treatment of the dentin disks using an phosphate buffer solution as shown in the SEM of Fig. 3 indicates a limited amount of dentinal tubule obturation.<br>
The ESCA and the SEM results all provide evidence that the unique combination of the neutral and alkaline potassium ion containing dentifrice components in combination with high releasable fluoride ion concentration levels effects an unexpected significant improvement in the remediation of dentinal hypersensitivity.<br><br>
A single component dentifrice designated Dentifrice Z was prepared which contained the ingredients listed in Table V below. The dentifrice composition has a pH of 8.5.<br>

In-Vitro Remineralization/Demineralization Test with Fluoride Uptake<br>
•	Specimen Preparation<br>
An in vitro fluoride uptake test method using enamel specimens (3 mm diameter) removed from extracted human teeth and mounted in rods to evaluate the performance of Dentifrice 2. The specimens were ground and polished to a high luster with Gamma Alumina using standard methods. Eighteen specimens per group were prepared for this study.<br>
•	Initial Decalcification<br>
Artificial lesions were formed in the enamel specimens by a 96-hour immersion into a solution of 0.1 M lactic acid and 0.2% Carbopol C907 which was 50% saturated with hydroxyapatite and adjusted to pH 5.0. The lesion surface hardness range was 25-45 and average lesion depth was approximately 70|i,<br>
•	Saliva Collection<br>
A 50:50 mixture of pooled, human saliva and a mineral solution was used as the remineralization medium in all treatment regimens. Wax-stimulated saliva was collected from at least five individuals and refrigerated until used Saliva samples were then pooled with vigorous stirring prior to distribution (7.5 ml + 7.5 ml mineral mix) into 30 ml treatment beakers. Fresh saliva/mineral mix was used each day (changed during the acid challenge period).<br>
•	Treatment Slurries<br>
During the treatment period, the specimens were immersed in dentifrice slurries to simulate daily brushing. The slurries were prepared by adding 5.0 g of dentifrice to 10 g of the fresh saliva/mineral mix solution in a beaker with a magnetic stirrer. A fresh slurry was prepared just prior to each treatment.<br>
   Treatment Regimen<br>
The cyclic treatment regimen consisted of a 4.0 hour/day acid challenge in the lesion forming solution described above with four, one-minute dentifrice treatment periods. After ihe treatments, the specimens were rinsed with running distilled water and then replaced back into the saliva. The remaining time (about 20 hours) the specimens were in the pooled, human saliva, remineralization system. The regimen was repeated for 20 days. The treatment schedule used was as follows:<br>
a.	8:00-8:01 a.m.<br>
b.	8:01-9:00 a.m.<br>
c.	9:00-9:01 a.m.<br>
d.	9:01-10:00 a.m.<br>
e.	10:00 a.m.-2:00 p.m.<br>
f.	2:00-3:00 p.m.<br>
g.	3:00-3:01 p.m.<br>
h.	3:01-4:00 p.m.<br>
i.	4:00-4:01 p.m.<br>
j.	4:01 p.m.-8:00 a.m.<br>

*     On the first day, this treatment was not given; the test began with one hour in saliva to permit pellicle development prior to any treatments.<br>
•   Fluoride Analysis<br>
At the end of the 20-day treatment regimen, the fluoride content of each enamel specimen was determined using the microdrill technique to a depth of 100µ. Fluoride data were calculated as µg F/cm3: (µg F X dilution factor — volume of drilling). The results of the fluoride analysis are recorded in Table VI below.<br>
For purposes of comparison, a phase dentifrice designated "Composition C", which had a fluoride ion content of 5000 ppm in which potassium nitrate was absent was also tested for fluoride ion uptake. Composition C had a pH of 7.5. The fluoride uptake for Composition C is also recorded in Table VI.<br><br>
Dentifrice<br><br>
Table VI Fluoride <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The fluoride uptake data recorded in Table VI indicate that the single phase composition that contained 5% potassium nitrate in which the pH was 9.0 unexpectedly deposited substantially more fluoride ion about four times as much than a comparative single phase composition in which the pH was 8.0 and potassium nitrate was not present in the dentifrice.<br>
Dentifrice Z was tested in vitro for in situ remineralization of caries lesions in employing the methodology described below.<br>
•	Remineralization Measurements<br>
Following fluoride analysis discussed above all samples were tested for surface hardness changes. The difference between the hardness following treatment and initial lesion hardness indicated the ability of that treatment to enhance remineralization.<br>
•	Determination of Enamel Resistance to Demineralization<br>
The resistance of the treated enamel to a subsequent acid challenge was determined by placing the treated specimens into the lesion formation solution (with no remineralization phase) for one 2-hour and one 16-hour period of simulated plaque acid challenge (SPAC). Following each acid challenge, the surface hardness of the specimens was measured as a Vickers Hardness Number (VHN) using a Leite Microhardness tester. The difference between the hardness following each subsequent demineralization and the initial lesion hardness reflected the degree of resistance to demineralization provided by each dentifrice.<br>
Results of the remineralization tests of Dentifrice Z are recorded in Table VII below.<br>
For purposes of comparison a toothpaste product designated Dentifrice D having a composition substantially similar to Dentifrice Z except that potassium nitrate was not included in Dentifrice D was also tested for remineralization efficacy. The pH of Dentifrice D was 7.5. The remineralization results for Dentifrice D are also recorded in Table VII below.<br>
Table VII <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The desensitizing efficacy of Dentifrice Z was evaluated following the procedure of Example I.<br>
For purposes of comparison the procedure of the Example I was repeated with another group of similarly prepared disks using a dentifrice designated "Dentifrice E". Dentifrice E differed from Dentifrice Z in that the fluoride content was 1100 ppm Fluoride and did not contain phosphate buffering salts.<br>
Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis results are recorded in Table VIII below.<br>
TABLE VIIl<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The results recorded hi Table VIII indicate that the amount of Ca and deposited on the surface of the dentin disks treated with Dentifrice Z of the present invention was significantly greater, that is, three times greater than the disks treated with comparative Dentifrice E, indicating a significantly greater degree of tubular obturation would be experienced with the use of Dentifrice Z as compared to Dentifrice E.<br><br><br><br><br>
