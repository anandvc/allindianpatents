PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
The invention relates to a combing machine with an assembly for supplying a fiber mass to a combing device, the combing device combing out that end of the fiber mass which is fed in steps and clamped by the assembly and which is subsequently supplied to a take-off device which takes off a fiber bundle from the fed and combed-out end and discharges it to a following device for forming a fiber fleece.<br>
In known combing machines, the lap sheet taken off from a lap is fed via a nipper, by means of a feed roller, to a circular comb arranged below the nipper, in order to be combed out. During the combing operation, the nipper oscillating back and forth is closed, the lap end (also called a fiber fringe) which projects from the nip line of the nipper being grasped by a comb segment of the circular comb and being combed out. The nipper is subsequently pivoted into a front position and at the same time opens. In this case, the free end of the fiber fringe comes into the region of the end of a previously formed fiber fleece which has been conveyed back by a specific amount via a reversing movement by a pair of detaching rollers, in order to piece up a new combed-out fiber bundle. In this piecing-up operation, the direction of rotation of the detaching rollers is again in the transport direction. The combed-out fiber fringe then lies in the manner of a roof tile, with a predetermined overlap, on the end of the fiber fleece and comes into the nip line of the detaching rollers as a result of the rotational movement of the detaching rollers. During this operation, as a rule, a fixed comb attached to the nipper penetrates into the fiber fringe. This then has the task, during the detaching operation, of retaining husk fragments and neps and also short fibers which are located particularly in that region of the fiber fringe which has not been grasped by the comb segment of the circular comb. During the further rotational movement of the detaching rollers, the fibers which are grasped by the nip line and are not retained in the nipper are taken off in the form of a fiber bundle and pieced to the end of the fiber fleece via the nipping action of the detaching rollers. This operation is repeated during each comb cycle. That is to say, the direction of rotation of the detaching rollers has to be reversed before each new detaching or piecing-up operation (piecing operation). Since this operation has to be carried out approximately 350 to 400 times per minute, depending on the magnitude of the number of comb cycles, complicated and stable gear units are necessary in order, on the one hand, to execute a correspondingly necessary rotational movement and, on the other hand, to control the high accelerations and reversing movements occurring in this case.<br>
2<br><br>
In order to avoid these stringent requirements in the case of an ever-increasing demand for numbers of comb cycles, various versions have already been proposed, in which a reversing movement of the detaching device is no longer necessary. For example, EP-Al 450 360 discloses a device in which in each case two pairs of detaching rollers are used, the directions of rotation of which are oriented only in the transport direction. The pairs of detaching rollers are in this case mounted pivotably about a pivot axis and are alternately advanced correspondingly to the nipper in order to take off the fed and combed-out fiber fringe. The fiber bundles taken off in this way are transferred, with the aid of conveyer belts, to a pair of transport rollers, in which they are laid one on top of the other in the manner of a roof tile and pieced in order to form a fiber fleece. Although this device does not require any reversing movement, it is still highly complicated and susceptible to faults, particularly when very high numbers of comb cycles are demanded.<br>
Furthermore, EP-Al 450 410 discloses a device in which the piecing work has been transferred to the pair of piecing rollers following the pair of detaching rollers. This design of the pair of piecing rollers makes it possible for a reversing movement to be no longer necessary for the piecing operation. In this case, the pair of piecing rollers is provided with an upper piecing roller which is driven fixedly with respect to the stand and on which a pressure roller arranged pivotably and so as to be capable of being lifted off lies at the bottom during the piecing operation. In order to make it possible to piece a new fiber bundle up to the end of the fiber fleece already formed, in this device the transport of the fiber fleece has to be interrupted on account of the discontinuous detaching operation. This takes place by the lower piecing roller being lifted off from the upper driven piecing roller, with the result that the frictional connection via the fiber fleece between these two rollers is interrupted. That is to say, the lower and lifted-off piecing roller comes to a standstill, with the result that the discharging transport of the fiber fleece is also interrupted. This operation is carried out during each comb cycle. Disadvantages of this device are, on the one hand, the complicated movement of the lower piecing roller and, on the other hand, the intermittent acceleration of the fiber fleece for carrying out the piecing operation and for discharging transport. As a result, this device is highly susceptible to wear, and the quality of the fiber fleece may be impaired by the continuous accelerations.<br>
3<br><br>
To improve the devices described above, it was proposed in DE-A1 197 13 225 to drive the detaching and piecing rollers arranged in series, in such a way that the circumferential speeds of the rollers differ from one another, at least over a segment, during the comb cycle, the fleece end being permanently clamped. Moreover, in this case, to transfer the fiber bundle discharged from the detaching rollers, a guide means was proposed, which is intended to assist the piecing-up operation. Although the solutions known hitherto were simplified and improved by means of this device, a reliable and desired overlap (piecing) of the fiber bundle with the fiber fleece is not always ensured in the case of high numbers of comb cycles.<br>
EP-1 108 076 discloses a device for forming a fiber fleece, in which, after a combing process carried out by means of air action, the fiber bundle taken off via take-off cylinders is conveyed into a nip between a rotating screen drum and a roller cooperating with the screen drum. In this case, there is provision for the front end of the a new fiber bundle to come into overlap with the rear end of the fiber bundle previously discharged, said rear end still being located in the nip. Within the screen drum, a stationary diaphragm is provided, which is provided with orifices. The inner space, acted upon via a vacuum source, of the diaphragm or of the screen drum is connected to the ambient air of the screen drum via these orifices. This air routing is intended, in particular, to guide the rear end of the discharged fiber bundle onto the screen drum. In this device, air flows which may adversely influence exact piecing may arise in an uncontrolled way. Moreover, material upsets may occur in the region of the nip when work is carried out with high numbers of comb cycles and the front end of the fiber bundle impinges in this region at high speed. In a further exemplary embodiment shown in this publication, the combed-out fiber bundle is deposited onto a rotating conveyer belt and at the same time brought into overlap or pieced with the end of previously deposited fiber bundle. In the region of the take-up of the new fiber bundles, a duct connected to a vacuum source is provided within the conveyer belt equipped with air passages. With this solution, too, uncontrolled air flows may arise which adversely influence the piecing operation. In this case, too, there is likewise the risk of material upsets in the region of the point of transfer to the conveyer belt when the fiber bundle impinges onto the conveyer belt at high speed.<br>
4<br><br>
The set object of the invention, then, is to improve the known solutions and to propose a device which, even in the case of high numbers of comb cycles, makes it possible to have a reliable and desired piecing operation.<br>
This object is achieved in that it is proposed that the device consists of a rotating means which is provided on its periphery, over its circumference, with orifices for air passage, and at least a part region of the inner space of the means is connected to a vacuum source, and a cladding is provided which forms a space, partitioned off with respect to the surroundings, between the take-off device and the periphery of the rotating means, a part region of the partitioned-off space being formed by the periphery of the means and by the take-off device.<br>
With the design claimed, it is possible to carry out the piecing-up operation for the piecing process in a space in which it is then possible to control the air flows exactly, with the result that disturbing and uncontrolled air circulations can be avoided. It was shown, in tests, that the control of the air flows in the discharge region of the fiber bundles is tremendously important so that controlled piecing, even at high discharge speeds, can be carried out.<br>
The expression "partitioned off with respect to the surroundings" does not mean that the claimed space is encased completely, "airtight", with respect to the ambient air. That is to say, there may still be orifices for air ingress, which serve particularly for compensating again the air volume sucked away by the vacuum source. Orifices of this type may be provided, for example, between the outer boundary of the cladding and the take-off device. With orifices of this type being formed in a directed manner,<br>
the air routing can also be oriented exactly and influenced with regard to the piecing up of the discharged fiber bundle.<br>
Preferably, the partitioning off of the space with respect to the ambient air amounts to between 80% and 99%, with the result that the delivery of air from the surroundings into the partitioned-off space is ensured.<br>
The size of the fraction of orifices for air inlet into the partitioned-off space depends, for example, on the required vacuum within the space during the piecing operation.<br>
5<br><br>
Furthermore, it is proposed that a second means (Z, 78) be provided, via which the free air passage is controllable, at least over a part region of the orifices (35), between the surroundings of the first means (T) and the vacuum source (Q) at time intervals, in synchronization with the discharge of the fiber bundles (P).<br>
The term "controllable" means, in this context, the production or prevention of the free air passage between the vacuum source and the ambient air of the first means via the orifices of the latter.<br>
With this device, it is possible, even in the case of high numbers of comb cycles, to hold reliably the fiber bundle discharged by the detaching rollers and to piece it up (or piece it) to the end of the fiber fleece previously formed. Owing to the vacuum via the<br>
vacuum source, applied to the periphery of the first means in a directed manner at the correct time point via the second means, the discharged fiber bundle can be held correspondingly and subsequently laid with a desired overlap onto the end of the fiber fleece already formed.<br>
It is proposed to arrange the second means within the first means. This allows a compact type of construction and a functional arrangement.<br>
Preferably, the second means proposed within the first means is connected to a drive and is provided on its circumference with at least one orifice which extends approximately over the width of the taken-off fiber bundle and via which a connection between the orifices of the first means and the vacuum source can be made. The second means in this case serves as a control element for producing the connection between the orifices of the first means and the vacuum source. To ensure the synchronization described, the drive of the second means is drive-connected to the drive of the take-off device.<br>
In order to partition off corresponding regions of the orifices of the first means continuously with respect to the vacuum source, it is further proposed additionally to provide at least one covering element within the first means. Covering elements of this type are preferably mounted where the fiber fleece is doffed.<br>
6<br><br>
The first means preferably consists of a rotatably mounted screen drum, within which the second means is arranged as a rotatably mounted cylinder.<br>
To influence the air flow necessary for the transfer operation, it is further proposed that the rotational speed of the second means amounts to a single or a multiple of the number of comb cycles of the combing machine.<br>
With a corresponding design of the second means, particularly in terms of the number of its orifices distributed on its circumference, it is also possible that the rotational<br>
speed of the second means may amount to a fraction of the number of comb cycles of the combing machine. It is necessary merely to ensure the exact piecing up of the fiber bundle newly discharged in each case.<br>
In this case, it is also conceivable, depending on the application, for the rotational speed of the first or second means to be variable (controllable). Particularly by controlling the rotational speed of the second means, piecing (piecing spacing) can be influenced.<br>
Furthermore, it would also be conceivable to change or to control the direction of rotation of the first or second means. In this case, the directions of rotation of the two means may even be contradirectional.<br>
It is proposed, further, to mount the covering element within the second means or, as a further solution, also between the first and the second means. A covering means of this type will be provided, for example, in the region in which the fiber fleece formed on the first means has to be taken off, in order to supply it for following further processing.<br>
A further version of the invention may be envisaged, in which a stationary further means for controlling the application of a vacuum is provided within the first means. In this case, it is proposed that the second means consist of at least one stationary mounted duct which extends approximately over the width of the taken-off fiber bundle and is provided with an orifice projecting in the direction of the air passages of<br>
7<br><br>
the first means, the connection between the duct and the vacuum source being switchable via a controllable element provided.<br>
In order to ensure that the fiber fleece already formed is in bearing contact on the circumference of the screen drum during discharging transport, it is proposed that<br>
further smaller orifices be provided, distributed on the circumference of the second means, which extend only over a part region in terms of the width of the fiber bundle<br>
taken off. This gives rise continuously to a low vacuum on the periphery of the screen drum, which builds up in the gap between the screen drum and the cylinder, since the gap is continuously connected to the vacuum source. The effect of this low vacuum, however, has no influence on the transfer of the fiber bundle from the detaching device onto the screen drum and serves merely for holding the fiber fleece on the screen drum, as already described.<br>
It is advantageous if the cladding consists of a transparent material so that the operator is allowed a look into this region, without the cladding having to be demounted. This may also be advantageous in terms of possible cleaning work or for the prompt detection of fault sources.<br>
So that no fiber fly or other dirt can settle in the region of the cladding, it is proposed that at least parts of the cladding be produced from an antistatic material.<br>
To influence the air flows within the partitioned-off space actively and in a directed way, it is proposed that, in the region of the cladding, at least one adjustable element be provided, which is suitable for controlling at least one orifice for air passage between the partitioned-off space and the ambient air of the cladding.<br>
In this case, the element may consist of a flap which is pivotable about a pivot axis and which, as seen traversely to the transport direction of the fiber fleece, extends essentially over the length of the take-off device.<br>
It is in this case advantageously proposed that the pivot axis of the flap be arranged in the region above the take-off device and that the free end of the flap points in the direction of the take-off device.<br>
8<br><br>
In order to ensure that the fiber bundle is deposited reliably on the screen drum, it is proposed to mount the flap in such a way that the free end of the flap forms a nip with the first means in the open position.<br>
In order to assist the desired air routing, it is proposed that, within the cladding and in the region of the periphery of the first means, at least one guide element for air routing be provided, which extends at least over the width of the fiber bundle.<br>
In this case, it is advantageous that the distance (as seen transversely to the longitudinal direction of the guide element) between the guide element and the cladding is greater than the distance between the guide element and the periphery of the first means. This ensures that air circulation takes place, particularly above the guide element, between the guide element and cladding. This influences the time of the piecing of the front end of the fiber bundle onto the end of the fiber fleece, as is described in more detail later in the exemplary embodiments.<br>
To control the air circulation, particularly also in terms of easy doffing from the screen drum, it is proposed that, as seen in the transport direction of the fiber fleece, the cladding element has in its front end region a boundary which reduces the distance between the cladding and the periphery of the first means. The air flow which is generated within the cladding can thereby be interrupted at this point.<br>
Likewise in order to prevent undesirable air circulations in the discharge region of the take-off device, it is proposed that the cladding be provided with a cover which at least partially closes the free space between the take-off device and the periphery of the first means. This cover may, of course, also even be an intergrated component of the cladding.<br>
In order to doff the fiber fleece from the first means, it is proposed that a doffing device for doffing the fiber fleece formed on the first means is provided for said<br>
means. Advantageously, the doffing device is arranged downstream of the boundary of the cladding.<br>
9<br><br>
The doffing device may in this case be a pair of rollers.<br>
A doffing roller which cooperates directly with the first means may likewise also be provided for doffing the fiber fleece from this first means.<br>
To form a sliver for subsequent further processing or for depositing in a can, the doffing device may be a sliver-forming device. For example, the pair of rollers may be followed by a known web funnel for sliver formation.<br>
In order that the vacuum of the vacuum source is applied so as to be effective only mainly in the region in which the fiber bundle is to be pieced up, the radial distance between the first means and the second means must be kept relatively short in order to avoid undesirable air flows. In this case, it is proposed that the radial distance between the screen drum and the cylinder be between 0.2 and 2 mm.<br>
A further design variant of the invention is the mounting of the second means outside the first means. In this case, it is proposed that the second means consist of a movable cover which extends at a distance over a part region of the circumference of the first means. With this movable cover, the orifices of the first means can be partitioned off from outside against free air passage in respect of the applied vacuum source. The movement of the cover preferably takes place via a control device, so that the air flows for the operation of piecing up the new fiber bundle can be controlled exactly. In this version, too, it is advantageous to provide a cladding in order to obtain controlled air flows for the piecing-up operation (piecing operation).<br>
The cladding may, of course, also be designed to be at least partially transparent and/or antistatic.<br>
It is advantageous if at least one of the elements, namely the first or second means, the covering element or covering elements and the covering hood, are fastened so as to be easily exchangeable. As a result, on the one hand, maintenance is simplified and, on the other hand, other parts required according to the materials to be processed can be<br>
installed very quickly.<br>
10<br><br>
Further advantages of the invention are indicated and described in more detail with reference to the following exemplary embodiments.<br>

Fig.7 shows a diagrammatic side view of a further exemplary embodiment according to the invention in the region of the take-off device.<br>
Fig. 1 shows an exemplary embodiment according to the known prior art. In this case, the lap sheet 2 supplied by a nipper assembly 1 is supplied to a pair of take-off rollers 5 (also called a pair of detaching rollers) via a feed cylinder 3. The fiber fringe 7 projecting out of the open nipper 1 passes in this case onto the rear end 8 of a combed<br>
11<br><br>
fleece or fiber fleece 10, with the result that it passes into the nip of the take-off rollers 5 due to the forward movement of said take-off rollers. In this case, the fibers which are not held by the retaining force of the lap sheet or by the nipper are torn out of the composite structure of the lap sheet. During this detaching operation, the fiber fringe is additionally drawn through the needles of a fixed comb 9. The fixed comb 9 in this case causes the combing out of the rear part of the taken-off fiber fringe and also the retention of neps, impurities and the like. On account of the speed differences between the lap sheet 2 and the take-off speed of the detaching rollers, the taken-off fiber fringe is drafted to a specific length. A pair of guide rollers 6 is arranged downstream of the pair of detaching rollers. During this detaching operation, an overlap or doubling of the front end of the detached or taken-off fiber bundle with the rear end 8 of the fiber fleece 10 occurs. As soon as the detaching operation or the piecing operation is terminated, the nipper returns to a rear position in which it is closed and feeds the fiber fringe 7 projecting out of the nipper to a comb segment 12 of a circular comb 13 in order to be combed out. Before the nipper assembly 1 returns into its front position again, the take-off rollers 5 and the guide rollers 6 execute a reversing movement, with the result that the rear end 8 of the fiber fleece 10 is conveyed back by a specific amount. This is required in order to achieve an overlap necessary for the piecing operation.<br>
Fig. 2 shows an exemplary embodiment according to the invention in which the takeoff rollers 5 no longer have to execute a reversing movement. That is to say, the fiber bundle P taken off by the take-off rollers is discharged discontinuously onto a following screen drum T under the influence of an air flow L and is pieced up to the end E of the fiber fleece V already formed, as is described in more detail below.<br>
It may be gathered from fig. 3, in the sectional illustration A-A according to fig. 2, that the screen drum T is mounted rotatably on a flange 21 via a bearing 20. The flange 21 is connected fixedly to a cylinder Z. The cylinder Z is fastened fixedly to the rotation on a shaft 24 via the flange 21. The shaft 24 is mounted, overhung, in the machine stand MG via a bearing 22. The shaft 24 is, of course, also secured (not shown) in its axial position. In the end region of the screen drum T in which the bearing 20 is located, a belt pulley 26 is connected to the screen drum and at the same time forms the lateral termination against the ambient air. Via a belt 27, illustrated<br>
12<br><br>
diagrammatically, which lies on the belt pulley 26, the latter is driven via a drive wheel, not shown in any more detail, which is drive-connected to the gear G. The drive of the gear takes place via a motor M which is controlled by a control unit ST. Outside the inner space IR of the screen drum T, a drive wheel 30 is fastened fixedly to the rotation on the shaft 24. This drive wheel 30, which may be, for example, a gearwheel, a chain wheel or a belt pulley, is connected to the gear G via a drive connection 31, shown diagrammatically.<br>
On the end face lying opposite the bearing point 20, a duct 33 is fastened to the machine stand MG on the shaft 24. The tubular duct 33 projects with its end face 32 into the clear diameter of the cylinder Z and consequently partitions off the inner space IR with respect to the ambient air. Sealing elements 38 may be provided for the further sealing off between the stationary duct 33 and the rotating screen drum T. It is also possible to design these elements as bearing means, in order to support the screen drum T additionally on the duct 33 on this side.<br>
A duct 34 connected to a vacuum source Q issues into the duct 33. That end face 32 of the duct 33 which projects into the screen drum T is provided with an orifice 36, via which the air flow can take place out of the inner space IR of the screen drum to the vacuum source Q, as indicated diagrammatically by arrows.<br>
As shown diagrammatically, the screen drum T is provided with a multiplicity of orifices 35 which are formed, distributed over its entire circumference. Instead of a screen drum made from metal, plastic or other firm materials, which is provided with orifices on its circumference, it would also be conceivable to use a cloth or another fabric which has a specific air permeability. This fabric would have to be drawn correspondingly onto a scaffold.<br>
Fastened on the end face 32 of the duct 33 via fastening means, for example screws 37, is a covering element Al which, as can be seen particularly from fig. 2, extends over a portion of the circumferential region on the inside of the screen drum T.<br>
13<br><br>
In this case, the covering element Al is arranged at a short distance on the inside of the rotating cylinder Z. It is also possible, however, for the covering element Al to be arranged stationarily between the screen drum T and the cylinder Z.<br>
In the present example of fig. 3, a short radial distance a, which may amount to between 0.2 and 2 mm, is provided between the screen drum T and the cylinder Z. A low vacuum is generated in this radial free space between the screen drum T and the cylinder Z as soon as the vacuum source Q is switched on actively. As is explained in more detail later, this low vacuum serves for retaining the fiber fleece V already formed on the screen drum, at least in the region in which no covering element Al is mounted. So that a connection between the inner space IR, which is connected to the vacuum source Q, and the radial free space between the drum T and the cylinder Z exists at any time, a plurality of small orifices 53 may be provided on the circumference of the cylinder Z. The size and number of these orifices 35 are in this case selected such that the piecing-up operation or piecing operation on the screen drum T is not thereby influenced. In the version shown, only three such orifices in one line are shown. A plurality of orifices 53 of this type may be arranged, distributed on the circumference of the cylinder Z.<br>
What may likewise be gathered from fig. 3 is a part region of an orifice SI which is formed in the cylinder Z and connects the vacuum source Q to a portion of the screen drum T provided with orifices 35.<br>
The covering element Al is mounted in the region of doffing rollers 40, so that the fiber fleece V can easily be doffed from the screen drum T via the driven rollers 40. This fiber fleece V is supplied by the rollers to a following web funnel 41, to which the fleece is gathered together from the width B (fig. 3) into a sliver FB. Fleece gathering devices of this type are already known in many variations in combing machines, cards or else drafting arrangements, and therefore they are not dealt with in any more detail here.<br>
The sliver FB formed in the web funnel 41 can be deposited into a can 44 via a funnel<br>
wheel 43.<br>
14<br><br>
To control the air flow L which is essential for the operation of piecing up the fiber bundle P to the fleece V, a stationary covering hood 46 is mounted above the screen drum T. As shown diagrammatically in fig. 3, the covering hood has lateral walls 47 which extend on both end faces of the covering hood 46 into the region of the circumference U of the screen drum T. This gives rise, in conjunction with the circumferential surface U of the screen drum T and with the take-off rollers 5, to a space AR partitioned off with respect to the surroundings. This is to ensure that no uncontrolled air flows arise. So that the air flow is interrupted in the region of the doffing rollers 40, at the end of the covering hood 46 a stay 49 is mounted, which reduces the distance between the covering hood 46 and the screen drum T to a necessary minimum distance, so that the fiber fleece V can still pass this point. Likewise for partitioning off and for avoiding uncontrolled air flows, between the lower discharge roller 5 and the screen drum T a cover 50 is provided which for the most part covers this free space.<br>
Between the screen drum T and the inner wall of the covering hood 46, a bar 52 is mounted, which is at a distance b from the screen drum T which is shorter than the distance c between the bar 52 and the covering hood. The bar 52 is fastened to the side walls 47 of the covering hood 46. For setting in light of different conditions, the bar may also be fastened so as to be adjustable in its length.<br>
Due to the greater distance c of the bar from the covering hood, the air flow L which arises due to the application of a vacuum, for example via the orifice SI, will run above the bar 52. This effect is required for carrying out the piecing-up operation described below.<br>
In the example, shown, both the screen drum T and the cylinder Z have an identical counterclockwise direction of rotation. The circumferential speed of the cylinder Z coincides with the circumferential speed of the take-off rollers 5. That is to say, the rotational speed of the cylinder Z must run synchronously with the comb cycle, so that the piecing-up operation or piecing operation can be carried out synchronously with the discharge of the fiber bundle. It is also possible, however, for the selected rotational speed of the cylinder Z to be a multiple of the comb cycle, without synchronization being lost. It is also likewise possible to drive the cylinder Z at a<br>
15<br><br>
rotational speed which is a fraction of the circumferential speed of the cylinder in relation to the take-off rollers. In this case, however, it is necessary for the number of orifices in the cylinder to correspond to the fraction provided. If, for example, the circumferential speed of the cylinder Z corresponds to half the circumferential speed of the take-off rollers 5, the cylinder must have double the number of orifices SI in order to carry out the piecing-up operation. That is to say, two piecing operations are carried out during one revolution of the cylinder Z.<br>
The rotational speed of the screen drum T is substantially slower than that of the cylinder Z and is governed by the piecing-up operation. With the change in rotational speed of the screen drum, the piecing spacing or the overlap of the end E with the start VE of the fiber bundle P can be changed.<br>
In the example shown in fig. 2, the front end VE of the fiber bundle P is already located in the region of the screen drum T. Via the orifice SI of the rotating cylinder Z, the space between the covering hood 46 and the screen drum T is connected via the orifices 35 of the screen drum T to the vacuum source Q which can be activated via a control unit ST. The air flow L thereby arising runs above the bar 52 due to the geometric installation conditions already described. The positioning of the orifice SI is in this case coordinated exactly with the operation of delivering the fiber bundle P by the take-off rollers 5, in order to generate the air flow described. Under the action of the air flow L, the front end VE of the fiber bundle P is oriented into a direction above the bar 52, thus ensuring that this front end VE does not collide with the screen drum T and is not upset. Instead, this end lifts off from the circumferential surface U of the screen drum. As the process continues, the end of the fiber bundle P is released from the take-off rollers 5. The orifice S2 is then located in the region of the end E of the fiber fleece V and, due to the connection to the vacuum source Q and to the orifices 35, has the effect that the released end of the fiber bundle is first laid onto the screen drum. After this rear end HE of the fiber bundle P has come to bear onto the screen drum T, the front end VE is also drawn onto the fiber fleece V via the orifice S2 due to the applied vacuum. The air flow L is in this case interrupted, since the orifice SI is in the meantime located in the region of the cover Al and therefore the<br>
action of the vacuum source is prevented in this region. This operation is repeated during each comb cycle, with the result that a new fiber bundle P is repeatedly pieced<br>
16<br><br>
up to the fiber fleece V at a uniform rotational speed of the screen drum T. The overlap of the front end VE of the fiber bundle P with the end E of the fiber fleece V may be determined by the rotational speed of the screen drum, as already described.<br>
The fiber fleece V is transferred due to the rotational movement of the screen drum T into the doffing region AB of the rollers 40, in which the stationarily mounted covering element Al is also arranged. This ensures that this region is partitioned off from the vacuum source Q, with the result that the fiber fleece can easily be lifted off from the circumferential surface U, in order to be transferred into the nip line between the take-off rollers 40. The fiber fleece V is discharged via these driven rollers 40 (the drive is not shown) into a web funnel 41 which is likewise followed by driven takeoff rollers 42. In the web funnel 41, the fibre fleece V is gathered in a known way into a sliver FB which is taken off by the take-off rollers 42 and deposited in loop form into a can 44 via a funnel wheel 43 shown diagrammatically. The sliver FB thus deposited can subsequently be transported for further processing, for example to a flyer or to an open-end machine, by means of the can 44.<br>
The exemplary embodiments of fig. 2a and fig. 2b are essentially identical with respect to the exemplary embodiment of fig. 2 and fig. 3 with the exception of a mounting of the pivotable flap KL in the region of the cladding 46. The following description therefore deals essentially with the significance of the additional flap KL, whereas the further functions and sequences may be gathered from the description of fig. 2. The cladding 46, in conjunction with the corresponding lateral walls 47 and the boundary due to the screen drum T and with the take-off rollers 5, gives rise to a<br>
space AR which is essentially partitioned off with respect to the ambient air and within which the operation of piecing delivered fiber bundles P to the fiber fleece V already formed is carried out.<br>
In order to control this operation more effectively even at high delivery speeds of the fiber bundles, it is proposed, in the example of fig. 2a and fig. 2b, to use a flap KL which is mounted pivotably about a pivot axis SA. The pivot axis SA may in this case be mounted in the machine stand or directly on the covering hood.<br>
17<br><br>
The flap KL is illustrated in more detail in the enlarged part view of fig. 2c. A lever 85 is connected fixedly in terms of rotation on the pivot axis SA which, for example, is mounted pivotably and laterally in the region of the hood 46 or on the machine stand. Articulated on the free end of the lever 85 is the piston rod of a cylinder 88 which is mounted on the hood 46 or on the machine stand of the combing machine. The cylinder 88 is acted upon via the line 89, by a valve 86, with compressed air which is generated by a compressed air source 90. The valve 86 is controlled via the line 87 by the control unit ST, via which activation synchronous with the movement of the take-off rollers or, in particular, synchronous with the position of the orifices SI, S2 of the cylinder Z takes place.<br>
In the position shown in fig. 2a, the flap KL is in an upper closed position, in which the free end of the flap is approximately tangent to the circumference of the upper take-off roller 5b. That is to say, there is only a slight safety clearance between the upper take-off roller 5b and the flap KL. The front end VE of the fiber bundle P is overlapped by the prevailing air flow, indicated by arrows L, onto the rear end of the fiber fleece V already formed. This air flow L occurs as a result of the corresponding position of the orifice SI, via which the front region of the hood 46 is put under a<br>
vacuum. The air volume sucked away in this case is, for example, partly delivered again via a gap 92 present between the lower take-off roller 5a and the cover 50, as indicated by an arrow. The second orifice S2 is still located behind the cover Al and is therefore inactive.<br>
As soon as the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P is released by the take-off rollers 5, the orifice SI is in the position, shown in fig. 2b, behind the cover Al, with the result that said orifice is deactivated. The second orifice S2 has been displaced above the cover Al due to a correspondingly controlled rotational movement of the cylinder Z, thus giving rise to an air flow which brings the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P to bear on the screen drum T. This operation is assisted or safeguarded by the pivoting of the flap KL about the axis SA into a lower position shown in fig. 2b. In this case, the control ST acts upon the cylinder 88 via the valve, with the result that the piston of the cylinder 88 is extended, and the flap KL is pivoted clockwise downward into the position shown by the lever 85. In this lower position, a nip KS for the fiber bundle P is brought about between the flap KL and the circumference of the screen drum T,<br>
18<br><br>
with the result that, on the one hand, the fiber bundle comes to bear reliably on the screen drum T and, on the other hand, due to the orifice 90 which has occurred, a corresponding airflow L is obtained, via which the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P comes to bear positively on the screen drum T. This is brought about, in particular, by the air flowing behind via the orifice 90.<br>
When this operation is concluded, the flap KL is pivoted upward again into the position shown in fig. 2a, with the result that a new fiber bundle P can then be supplied by the take-off rollers 5 for the further piecing up. By the flap KL being used, the operation of piecing the fiber bundles on the screen drum can be carried out easily and in a directed manner even at high delivery speeds of the fiber bundles, without damage to the fiber bundles during the piecing-up operation. Via the flap KL, it is possible, in particular, to control or to influence the air flows necessary for the piecing-up operation.<br>
Instead of the flap KL, it would also be conceivable to form additional orifices which can be closed or opened via a corresponding control at the appropriate time point by means of a device.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment, in which a covering element Al is mounted within the driven cylinder Z and extends essentially in the lower region of the cylinder or also over the doffing region AB. The drive of the screen drum T or of the cylinder Z and also the connection to the vacuum source Q correspond essentially to the sectional illustration shown in fig. 3..<br>
In contrast to the exemplary embodiment according to fig. 2, in the version according to fig. 4 the cylinder Z is provided only with one orifice SI. Moreover, in this case, no bar 52 for air routing is provided within the covering hood 46. Below the take-up rollers 5 is arranged a cover 50 which causes the inner space of the covering hood to be partitioned off with respect to the surroundings and thereby prevents uncontrolled air circulations within the covering hood 46. In the run-out region, the covering hood 46 is provided with an angled end region 46a which projects approximately as far as the circumferential surface U, the distance from the circumferential surface U being selected such that the fiber fleece V can still easily pass this point. The elements<br>
19<br><br>
provided downstream of the doffing region AB correspond to the elements which have already been shown and described in the example of fig. 2.<br>
In the illustration shown in fig. 4, the cylinder Z is driven contradirectionally with respect to the screen drum T. That is to say, the movement of the orifice SI takes place opposite to the transport movement of the fiber fleece V. In the position shown, the orifice SI is located directly below the fleece end E and the front end VE of the fiber bundle P which overlap one another over a specific length. This overlap R is generally also designated as a piecing point.<br>
The take-off rollers 5, then, rotate as a function of the comb cycle in the direction of the arrow and release the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P. The cylinder Z also rotates as a function of the rotational movement of the take-up rollers 5, with the result that the orifice S1 is displaced in the direction of the cover 50. During this displacement, opposite to the direction of rotation of the screen drum T, a vacuum is also applied, downstream of the piecing point R, to the circumferential surface U via the orifices 35. The entire fiber bundle P is thereby sucked, as far as the released rear end HE, onto the circumferential surface of the screen drum and is deposited there. Further on, the orifice SI moves over the region in which the stationary cover Al is mounted. The connection between the orifice S1 and the vacuum source Q is thereby prevented. This ensures that no air flow running from the nipping point of the take-off rollers 5 in the direction of the cover is generated, which would result in the end of a new fiber bundle being deflected into a downward direction or possibly impinging, flush, onto the screen drum T. Furthermore, in the doffing region AB, the cover Al prevents the doffing of the fiber fleece V of the screen drum from being disturbed. As already described, there is a short radial distance of between 0.2 and 2 mm between the screen drum T and the cylinder Z. There is likewise a short distance between the cover Al and the cylinder Z, with the result that, due to the distances described, a low vacuum is built up on the entire circumferential surface U of the screen drum via the connection to the vacuum source. This is sufficient to hold the formed fiber fleece V on the circumferential surface U until it is taken off from the rollers 40 in the doffing region AB. This take-off operation is not adversely influenced or disturbed by this slight vacuum.<br>
20<br><br>
As soon as the orifice SI is located outside the region of the cover Al or above the doffing region AB due to the rotational movement of the cylinder, the inner space of the covering hood 46 is connected to the vacuum source Q again via the orifice SI or the orifices 35. Air is thereby sucked away from this region and is delivered through the air inlets present in the region of the take-off rollers 5. This gives rise to an air flow which runs within the covering hood 46 from the take-off rollers 5 as far as the respective position of the orifice SI. The effect of this is that the end VE of the new fiber bundle P supplied by the take-off rollers 5 is oriented approximately tangentially to the circumferential surface U of the screen drum T in the conveying direction of the fiber fleece, until the overlap R with the end E of the fiber fleece V occurs, as shown in fig. 4. This operation, then, is repeated during each comb cycle. The fiber fleece V formed in this case, after passing the angled termination 46a of the covering hood 46, is led away in the region of the discharge point AB to a following pair of rollers 40 and, as already described in the example of fig. 2, is supplied to a sliver-forming unit.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further exemplary embodiment, in which, in contrast to the example of fig. 2, the front end VE of the fiber bundle P is led away downward. The result of this is that the screen drum T also follows a clockwise direction of rotation, as indicated by an arrow. A stationary covering element Al is provided, which in this case is mounted within the cylinder Z. It would also be conceivable, however, to mount this covering element between the screen drum T and the cylinder Z.<br>
The two orifices SI and S2 provided ensure, in conjunction with the rotational movement of the cylinder Z, that the front end VE of the fiber bundle P is deflected downward in the direction of rotation of the screen drum, while the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P, after being released by the take-off rollers 5, comes to bear on the screen drum T opposite to the direction of rotation of the latter. In this case, the orifices are arranged on the circumference of the cylinder Z in such a way that they are located in the discharge region AG at the correct time point, in order to move the respective end VE or HE of the fiber bundle P onto the screen drum.<br>
The covering element Al is arranged in the region of the doffing region AB, in order to assist the doffing of the fiber fleece formed from the screen drum T by the rollers 40.<br>
21<br><br>
The mounting and drive of the screen drum T or of the cylinder Z may take place or be designed in a similar way to that shown in fig. 3.<br>
In the present example, the covering hood 46 is fastened in the lower region of the screen drum T and likewise possesses an angled part 46a, as in the example of fig. 4. That end of the covering hood 46 which lies opposite the angled part extends as far as the circumferential surface of the lower roller of the take-off rollers 5, in order as far as possible to partition off this region, too, with respect to the surroundings.<br>
Above the screen drum T, a further covering hood 54 is provided, which, like the covering hood 46, is likewise provided with lateral walls 57 which project as far as the screen drum T. For partitioning off with respect to the surroundings, the covering hood 54 is provided at one end region with a bend 54a which is only a short distance from the circumferential surface U. The opposite end of the covering hood 54 extends as far as the circumferential surface of the upper roller of the take-off rollers 5.<br>
The doffing region AB with the following elements for forming a sliver FB corresponds to the version which has already been described in fig. 2, and therefore is not discussed in any more detail here.<br>
In the position shown in fig. 5, the rear end E of the fiber fleece V and the front end VE of the fiber bundle P are in an overlap R which takes place, in particular, under the action of the orifice SI, via which the connection between the vacuum source Q via the orifices 35 of the screen drum has been made. Due to the air flow generated in this case, the front end VE, projecting out of the take-off rollers 5, of the fiber bundle P has been deflected downward and overlapped with the rear end E of the fiber fleece V. As soon as the rear end HE of the fiber bundle is released by the driven take-off rollers 5, it is oriented opposite to the transport direction of the screen drum T under the action of the second orifice S2 and is sucked onto the circumferential surface U of the screen drum via the vacuum generated in the region of the orifice S2.<br>
As already described in the previous examples, in the region of the circumferential surface U a low vacuum is generated which occurs due to the connection between the vacuum source Q and the free interspace between the cylinder Z and the screen drum.<br>
22<br><br>
This vacuum is sufficient to hold the formed fiber fleece V on the screen drum on its way to the doffing point.<br>
For piecing up a further fiber bundle P to the end E of the fiber fleece, the orifice SI is brought by the driven cylinder Z into the region below the cover Al, with the result that, due to the air flow occurring, the newly supplied front end VE of a fiber bundle is deflected downward and is finally overlapped with the rear end E of the fiber fleece V by the suction air in the region of the orifice SI on the screen drum T. The rear end HE of the new fiber bundle is laid on in the way already described due to the action of the orifice S2. The degree of overlap or the piecing may likewise be influenced by the choice of the rotational speed of the screen drum.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a further exemplary embodiment which is similar to the example according to fig. 2. The example according to fig. 6 differs from the example according to fig. 2 in that, instead of a driven cylinder inside the screen drum T, two stationary suction ducts Kl, K2 are provided, which can be connected to the vacuum source Q via the control ST. The drive of the screen drum T may take place in a corresponding way via the belt pulley 26, as was shown in fig. 3. Since the rotatable mounting of the cylinder Z is dispensed with in the present example, the mounting 20 of the belt pulley 26 may take place on a lengthened portion of a stationary duct 60 provided, which, in turn, is fastened fixedly to the machine stand MG. This fastening point may be designed such that the duct 60 is closed in this end region, whereas, at its opposite end, it is connected to the vacuum source Q.<br>
The duct 60 mounted stationarily at the center of the screen drum T has two ducts Rl and R2 separate from one another. The duct Rl may be connected to the vacuum source Q via the supply line Zl by means of a valve VI. A connection between the duct R2 and the vacuum source Q can be made via the supply line Z2 and via the valve V2. The valves VI and V2 are in each case activated by a control unit ST via the lines 64 and 65 respectively.<br>
The ducts Rl and R2 have in each case, distributed over their longitudinal direction, one or more orifices 61 and 62 which in each case issue into the suction ducts Kl and K2 which are connected firmly to the ducts Rl and R2 respectively.<br>
23<br><br>
These suction ducts 61 and 62 extend at least over the width B (fig. 3) of the fiber fleece V and have in each case an orifice 68 and 69 which are opposite the inner surface area of the screen drum T.<br>
In the doffing region AB, a covering element Al is provided, so that the fiber fleece V can easily be doffed from the screen drum T at this point.<br>
In the position shown in fig. 6, the valve V2 is opened by activation of the control ST via the line 65, with the result that a vacuum is applied to the screen drum T in the region of the orifice 69. This gives rise, as indicated diagrammatically by an arrow, to an air flow L which runs above the bar 52 essentially due to the geometric conditions already described in fig. 2. Due to this air flow, the front end VE of the fiber bundle P still retained by the take-off rollers 5 is oriented in the direction of the air flow, with the result that the free end of the fiber bundle P runs approximately tangentially with respect to the screen drum T. As soon as the front end VE of the fiber bundle P and the rear end E of the fiber fleece V overlap one another sufficiently, the valve V2 is closed and the valve VI simultaneously opened by means of the control ST. The air flow L breaks away, and the front end VE of the fiber bundle P is sucked onto the end E of the fiber fleece V by the vacuum applied via the suction duct Kl and forms an overlap with the fiber fleece. That is to say, the fiber bundle P is pieced or connected to the fiber fleece V. The screen drum rotates at a continuous rotational speed which is dependent on the size of the number of comb cycles.<br>
Due to the further rotational movement of the detaching cylinders 5, the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P is subsequently released and is sucked onto the screen drum T by the vacuum applied via the suction duct Kl.<br>
Since there is a short distance between the outer end of the respective suction duct Kl, K2 and the inner surface area of the screen drum T, in the inner space IR of the screen drum T there is likewise a low vacuum which is sufficient to hold the fiber fleece V on the circumferential surface U of the screen drum T in its transport as far as the<br>
doffing region AB.<br>
24<br><br>
After the rear end HE of the fiber bundle P has been laid onto the screen drum under the action of the suction airstream of the duct Kl, the valve VI is closed again via the control ST and at the same time the valve V2 is opened in order to generate an air flow L again. One end VE of a new fiber bundle is already present again in the meantime and, as already described, is oriented by the air flow L. The operation of piecing the new fiber bundle P up to the end E of the fiber fleece V transported continuously on the screen drum then takes place in the same way as described above. The valves VI and V2 are switched on as a function of the combing process or of the respective comb cycle. The control ST consequently obtains a signal via a line 72 from a sensor 71 which, for example, picks up the angular position of the circular comb shaft 75 of a circular comb 13 which is provided by means of a comb segment 12 for combing out a fiber fringe 7 fed by a nipper 1.<br>
The device for doffing the fiber fleece V formed on the screen drum T, along with subsequent sliver formation, corresponds to the versions of the exemplary embodiments described above, and therefore is not discussed in any more detail here. However, the design of a doffing device is not restricted to the examples shown.<br>
Fig. 7 shows an exemplary embodiment in which a pivotable cover 78 is used instead of a cylinder rotating within the screen drum T. This cover 78 is fastened pivotably about an axis 77 via an arm 76 and extends over a part region of the circumference U of the screen drum T. The arm 76 is connected to a drive 80 which is controlled by a control unit ST. Control in this case takes place in synchronization with the comb cycle.<br>
The inner space IR of the screen drum is connected to a vacuum source Q. The cover is at a short distance h from the circumference U of the screen drum T, thus allowing the fiber fleece V formed to pass through between the screen drum and cover. In the take-off region AB is arranged a take-off roller 74 which, together with the screen drum T, forms a take-off gap AS, doffs the fiber fleece V from the screen drum and transfers it to a following web funnel 41 where it is gathered into a sliver FB. The sliver FB thus formed passes via the take-off rollers 42 and the funnel wheel 43 into a<br>
can 44.<br>
25<br><br>
Above the cover 78, a covering hood 46 is provided, which has already been described in the preceding exemplary embodiments.<br>
As soon as the front end VE of the fiber bundle P is delivered by the take-off rollers 5, the cover 78 is in the position shown by dashes and dots, with the result that the end<br>
VE of the fiber bundle is oriented tangentially in the direction of rotation of the screen drum by the applied vacuum, since the lower region of the screen drum is partitioned off in the discharge region AG with respect to the inner space by the covering element 78. The covering element 78 is then pivoted in the direction of rotation of the screen drum, until it assumes the position which is shown by dashed lines. During this pivoting, the front end of the fiber bundle P slides on the surface of the covering element 78 until it is released by the latter in the direction of the screen drum T and overlaps with the end of the fiber fleece V already present. The rear end HE of the fiber bundle is then released by the take-off rollers 5 and passes onto the circumferential surface U of the screen drum T under the action of the vacuum in the inner space, the piecing operation thereby being concluded. For a further piecing operation, the covering element moves again into the position shown by dashes and dots.<br>
By virtue of the exemplary embodiments shown, it is possible, on the basis of a discontinuously delivered fiber bundle, to form in a simple way a fiber fleece which is discharged continuously, and where the take-off rollers do not have to execute a reversing movement for the piecing-up operation (piecing operation).<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
The invention relates to a combing machine with an assembly (1), for the introduction of a fibre mass (2) to a combing device (12, 13), whereby the combing device combs the end (7) of the fibre mass which is alternately let in and clamped by the assembly, which is subsequently introduced into a draw-off device (5) which draws off a fibre packet (P) from the combed end and supplies the same to a subsequent device (T, Z), for the formation of a fibre fleece (V). According to the invention, a reciprocating motion of the conventional draw-off devices (5) and a simplification of known<br>
solutions may be achieved, whereby the device (T, Z) comprises a circulating means (T), provided with openings (35) around the circumference on the periphery (U) thereof for an air inlet and at least one partial region of the interior of the circulating means (T) is connected to a vacuum source (Q) and provided with a casing (46, 47), forming a chamber (AR), isolated from the environment, between the draw-off device (5) and the periphery (U) of the circulating means (T), whereby a partial region of the isolated chamber (AR) is formed by the periphery (U) of the means (T) and by the draw-off device (5).<br></td>
