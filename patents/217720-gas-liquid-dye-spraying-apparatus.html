				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  <br>
The present invention is related to an Inconstant with the <br>
Gas-liquid dye-spraying apparatus which includes at least one set of siphon-type nozzles disposed on each of the upper and lower sides of the spraying passage in the dyeing machine. The nozzles eject strong wind to stably siphon the dye. Therefore, the dye is more evenly sprayed and the cloth is better guided. Also, the consumption of the dye is reduced.<br>
A conventional gas-liquid dyeing machine includes a cloth-dyeing loop apparatus and a nozzle disposed in the loop apparatus. The loop apparatus is composed of a machine head, a cloth-guiding pipe and a cloth reservoir. The dyeing machine operates in such a manner that the cloth to be dyed is placed in the loop apparatus. The nozzle ejects high pressure dye onto the cloth to spray dye the cloth. At the same time, by means of the injection force, the cloth is driven to circulate through the cloth-guiding pipe and cloth reservoir back to the nozzle for next spray dyeing. For example, Taiwanese Patent No. 325063 published in January 1998, entitled " gas-liquid dyeing machine " pertains to the above dyeing machine.<br>
However, the above structure has many shortcomings. Taiwanese Patent No. 337795 published in July 1998, entitled ' gas-liquid<br><br>
dyeing machine " discloses a gas-liquid dyeing machine including an improved cloth-guiding pipe, a cloth reservoir and a nozzle which can selectively eject the dye in forward direction or backward direction. Such structure is able to solve the problems of tangling and knotting of the cloth.<br>
In the conventional gas-liquid dyeing machine, the nozzle is not only used to spray the dye onto the cloth, but also is used to eject high pressure dye sufficient for driving the cloth to circulate. Therefore, the dye pump must have great horse power and a great amount of dye is required for achieving the above object.<br>
It can be known from the above that the conventional dyeing machines employ high pressure pump to suck the dye which is sprayed onto the cloth from the nozzle. According to such measure, much dye is consumed and the amount of the consumed water is also great. As a result, a great amount of waste dye and water will be discharged. This fails to meet the requirements of low cost and environmental protection. Therefore, many manufacturers of dyeing machines have tried to develop dyeing machine with low dye ratio. Such dyeing machines with low dye ratio eject the mixture of air and atomized dye onto the cloth at high pressure to dye and circulate the cloth. However, such dyeing machines are expensive. In addition, the wind strength and the mixing ratio of the air to the dye cannot bemobilely regulated according to the variety or thickness of the cloths. Therefore, much dye is wasted. These problems should be further solved.<br>
Taiwanese Patent Application No. 88207289 of this applicant discloses a gas-liquid dyeing machine which sprays the mixture of atomized dye and air onto the cloth to dye and drive the cloth. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the dye pump to have great horse power. Moreover, the consumption of the dye is reduced.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore a primary object of the present invention to provide an improved gas-liquid dye-spraying apparatus including at least one set of siphon-type nozzles disposed on each of the upper and lower sides of the spraying passage in the dyeing machine. The nozzles eject strong wind ^to evenly siphon and atomize the dye spilling from the dye outlet. Accordingly, the amount of the wind, the amount of the dye and the mixing ratio of the air to the dye can be accurately controlled. Therefore, the cloth can be better guided and the consumption of the dye is reduced. Also, the dyeing operation can be speeded and the evenness of dyeing can be enhanced.<br>
The present invention can be best understood through the following description and accompanying drawings wherein:<br>

Fig. 7A is a perspective sectional view of the dye-dividing strip according to Fig. 7.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Please refer to Fig. 1. The present invention is applicable to a gas-liquid dyeing machine, including a barrel body 10, a gas-liquid dye-spraying apparatus 20, a blower 30, a dye reservoir 40 and a dye-filtering tank 50. A dye heating/cooling device 60 can be added to the dyeing machine as necessary. In operation, a work piece 70 to be dyed ( such as a cloth ) is placed in the barrel body 10. The work piece 70 is circularly guided to pass through the spraying device 20 which sprays atomized dye onto the work piece 70. The work piece 70 is then downward guided into a cloth tank 11 under the barrel body 10 to be evened. The blower 30 strongly blows wind to the work piece 70 to continuously circularly spray the dye onto the work piece 70. Therefore, the work piece 70 can be evenly dyed. The strength of the wind blown by the blower will directly<br>
affect the speed at which the cloth 70 circularly passes through the dyeing point, that is, affect the dyeing efficiency. The extent to which the dye is atomized and the mixing ratio of the atomized dye to the air sent in by the blower will directly affect the evenness of spray dyeing.<br>
The present invention is designed for increasing the input of the wind and enhancing the dye-atomization of the spraying apparatus 20. The spraying apparatus 20 is designed with a form of a bellows. One side of the spraying apparatus 20 is formed with a wind inlet 21 connected with a wind outlet pipeline 21 of the blower 30 for accepting the strong wind blown by the blower 30. A cloth-guiding spraying passage 200 is disposed inside the spraying apparatus 20. At least one set of nozzles 22, 23 are disposed on each of the upper and lower sides of the spraying passage 200. The nozzles 22, 23 have air chambers 221, 231 connected with the wind outlet pipeline 31 of the blower 30 and dye-spilling rooms 222, 232 connected with the dye source SI. The air chambers 221, 231 and the dye-spilling rooms 222, 232 respectively have transverse linear air spouts 223, 233 and dye spouts 224, 234 respectively directed to the spraying passage 200. The ait spouts 223, 233 and dye spouts 224, 234 are arranged on upper and lower sides of the same position and adjacent to each other. Accordingly, when strong airflow is ejected from the air spouts 223, 233, vacuum negative pressure is naturally formed at the adjacent dye spouts 224, 234. At this time, in the case that there is sufficient dye existing in the dye-spilling rooms 222, 232 near the dye spouts 224, 234, due to the negative pressure, the dye<br>
can be evenly siphoned to discharge from the dye spouts 224, 234. Moreover, under effects of negative pressure and strong airflow, the dye can be fully atomized.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the air output is executed by air chambers 221, 231 instead of the conventional nozzles. By means of the larger space of the air chambers 221, 231, the airflow can be stabilized and evened. The exhaust volume and air pressure of every position of the air spouts 223, 233 are unified to effectively eliminate unevenness of airflow caused by concentration of air pressure and airflow. In addition, several staged spilling boards 225, 235 are disposed in the dye-spilling rooms 222, 232. The staged spilling boards 225, 235 are arranged on upper and lower sides and interlaced with each other to partially partition the dye-spilling rooms 222, 232 into at least one spilling compartment 226, 236. A dye supply pipe 24 extends into the spilling compartment 226, 236 farthest from the dye spouts 224, 234 to stably input the dye. Accordingly, when the dye is input to the spilling rooms 222, 232, the dye needs to further pass through several spilling compartments 226, 236 to get close to the dye spouts 224, 234 in an evenly spilling pattern. Therefore, the dye is evenly distributed near the spouts without concentrating. In cooperation with the sucking of the airflow and negative pressure produced by the air spouts 223, 233, the dye can be more stably and evenly siphoned to be strongly sprayed onto the upper and lower surfaces of the work piece 70. Accordingly, a spray dyeing effect with high evenness can be achieved.<br>
In addition, a cloth-folding nozzle 25 is disposed at the rearmost ends of the air chambers 221, 231. A valve 26 is intermittently opened and closed to intermittently block and unblock the nozzle 25, whereby the nozzle 25 can intermittently eject an airflow to the work piece after passing through the spraying apparatus 20. Accordingly, the cloth can be naturally crimped back and forth and reserved in the cloth tank 11.<br>
Figs. 6, 7 and 7A show a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment is different from the first one in that a dye-dividing strip 27 is used instead of the dye spouts and air spouts. The dye-dividing strip 27 is tightly mounted at the air spouts 223, 233. The dye-dividing strip 27 is formed with multiple three-way dividing through holes 271, 272. One way of the through hole is directed to the air chambers 221, 231. Another way of the through hole is directed to the spouts 223, 233. Still another way of the through hole communicates with preset through holes or dye spouts passing through the dye-spilling rooms 222, 232. Accordingly, it is easier to manufacture the dye-dividing strip 27 and the three-way dividing through holes 271, 272 forcedly divide the mixture of the air and the dye. This prevents the dye from being over-concentrated in spraying operation.<br>
According to the above arrangement, the air chambers 221, 231 and the dye-spilling rooms 222, 232 are totally independently designed. Before ejected, the air is separated from the dye without mixing therewith. Therefore, when the dyeing machine is to employ<br>
stronger and greater airflow to push the work piece to operate at higher speed, the amount of the sent out dye is controllable by independent spilling speed. This avoids unnecessary waste. In addition, the amount of the ejected air and dye and the mixing ratio can be independently and rnobilely regulated. Therefore, the wind strength and the mixing ratio of the air to the dye can be conveniently regulated according to the requirements of different kinds of cloths to be spray dyed. By means of the present invention, the production efficiency and evenness of dyeing can be apparently enhanced.<br>
The above embodiments are only used to illustrate the present invention, not intended to limit the scope thereof. Many modifications of the above embodiments can be made wi thout departing from the spirit of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
