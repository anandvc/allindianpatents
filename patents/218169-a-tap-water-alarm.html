				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a tap water alarm.<br>
BACKGRAOUND OF INVENTION<br>
The main purpose of this invention is to provide an apparatus which can inform the arrival of incoming water supply through taps. In some parts of world particularly where water is not abundantly available, the water supplied through taps is in limited quantities and comes only for a very limited period of time. Timing of water supply can be irregular and odd (sometimes in wee hours of morning). So it is preferable that an audible signal be provided to the person in charge of collecting water, when the supply starts. Pat No. GB2103798 discloses a liquid level alarm device suitable for big containers like bath tubs. The present invention employes different means of closing the alarm circuit suitable to work inside a small and portable housing forming the activating unit of tap water alarm. Present invention also has the added advantage of terminating the alarm signal itself after some period of time.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the invention is to provide an alarm activating unit which can sound an audible alarm upon arrival of fluid supply particularly water supply through taps.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide tap water alarm system where bell unit is remotely connected with base activating unit.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an alarm activating apparatus which terminates the activating signal by itself after certain period of time thus increasing the battery life.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an alarm activating apparatus which does not activate upon tilting, thus avoiding any chance of accidental use of battery.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide tap water alarm system in which the activating unit and bell unit are devoid of any fixing means and are fully portable.<br>
Further features of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1   is the sectional front view of the preferred embodiment of alarm activating unit.<br>
FIG.2 is the top view of the activating unit taken along line 1-1.<br>
FIG.3 shows underside of the activating unit.<br>
FIG.4 is the isometric view showing the preferred engagement of the partition plate with<br>
the main body of the activating unit.<br>
FIG.5 shows the isometric view of tilt disconnector.<br><br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The preferred embodiment of the alarm activating unit contains a series circuit which is powered by a battery through two sets of open contacts. This circuit is connected with a radio transmitter for transmitting a limited range operating signal for a remote bell unit. One set of open contacts is normally in closed position when the unit stands upright on its bottom supports and forms the tilt disconnector unit. The other set of open contacts are in form of two springs which can be closed by pressing a conducting surface against both of them.<br>
In the present embodiment this task is done by a conducting plate affixed to the top face of a hollow cylindrical float which can slide vertically inside an open ended cylinder, at the top of which are these springs attached. This cylinder- float assembly is held vertically inside a container which when filled by incoming fluid raises the float up which causes the conducting plate on top of it to press against the two springs thus completing the transmitter circuit which in turn transmits the signal to activate bell unit. The float has a small hole at bottom face through which when water enters inside the float, balances the upward buoyant force on float by its weight and float starts to descend after certain period of time. This arrangement serves as a timer to disconnect the transmitter circuit elapsing certain period of time from its activation. This serves in prolonging battery life.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 1 to 5, the preferred embodiment of the alarm activating unit comprises a rectangular housing preferably moulded of plastic material. It comprises of main housing part 10 having top cover 12. The space inside the housing is divided into two partitions 14 and 16 by a partition plate 18. The upper compartment 16 being smaller as compared to lower compartment 14. The partition plate 18 rests on the internal rim 20 integral with the main housing part 10 through holes 22 which match with holes 24 on rim 20 for a screw tightening. The partition plate 18 has two circular openings 26 &amp; 28 with their respective collars 30 &amp; 32 on upper side. The larger collar 30 has internal threads on its inner face.<br>
A hollow cylinder 34 open at both ends passes through opening 26 of partition plate and engags with collar 30 through a thread joint. The cylinder 34 has inverted V shaped slots 36 along lower end periphery and passes into a vertically held container 38 resting on the bottom face of main housing part 10. The container 38, open ended at the top has a small hole 40 at its bottom face which is supported off the bottom face of main housing 10 by bottom supports 42. A circular cap 44 closes the top of the cylinder preferably through thread joint. The cap 44 carries two springs 45 at its inner side.<br>
The cylinder 34 contains inside it a hallow cylinder 46 closed at both ends which acts as a float and can slide vertically inside cylinder 34. The float 46 carries conducting plate 48 at its top face and a small hole 50 at its bottom face. It also carries vent holes 52 at top portion.<br><br>
The under side of main housing part 10 has holes 54 and is supported off the ground by bottom supports 56.<br>
The top cover 12 has pipe connector integral with it on the outer side of which connects the inlet water pipe from tap. The inner side of connector 58 is connected with flexible pipe 59 which passes through collar 32 into container 38.<br>
In the upper chamber 16 of the main housing there is a series circuit between battery 60, switch 61, transmitter 62 and tilt disconnector 64 through wires 65 and pair of springs 45 which form the open part of circuit. The purpose of tilt disconnector is to disconnect the circuit when the main housing device tilts and the open circuit through springs become closed. The tilt disconnector represented as a whole by no. 64 as shown in fig. 5 consists of small housing 66 in the lower portion of which are fixed two metallic strips 68 which form the open ends of the series circuit. The strips are thicker at tips to ensure proper connectivity with conducting weight 70 which is free to move in the housing 66. Normally when the whole device rests on the ground and is vertically upwards, the weight 70 wiil rest on both the strips and form a closed circuit, but if the body tilts, the weight 70 will lift from one of the strips 68 and disconnect the circuit. This arrangement is to ensure the device activates only when it is filled with water.<br>
The incoming water or any fluid enters the alarm activating unit along arrow 72, passes into the container 38, enters the cylinder 34 through inverted V - grooves, raises the float 46 which in turn makes the conducting plate 48 to touch both the springs 45 which completes the series circuit and makes the transmitter to transmit the operating signal The fluid after filling container 38, overflows from its top open end and escapes from drain holes 54. Hole 40 serves to drain out rest of fluid inside container 38 through bottom face. While the float 46 is in raised position and touching both the springs 45, fluid starts to enter the float through opening 50, displaced air being vented out through holes 52. After a while the weights of water inside the float balances the upwards buoyant push on float and float begins to come down disconnecting the circuit. The times for which the float 46 remains in touch with springs 45 i.e. the time for which the signal is transmitted is inversely proportional to the size of hole 52. This arrangement serves as a timer for automatically disconnecting the activating circuit, once it is activated. This will save the battery life in case attendant is not present to switch off the activated circuit.<br>
In use, the device is very simple to operate. The activating unit need to be connected with the supply tap by a flexible pipe. The tap need to be set open when the water supply is expected. When the alarm sounds, the attendant just need to switch off the activating unit and turn off the tap.<br>
Various modifications of the above described and illustrated arrangement are possible within the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims, especially in respect of the manner in which the open contact of the transmitter circuit can be closed by rising float.<br><br>
