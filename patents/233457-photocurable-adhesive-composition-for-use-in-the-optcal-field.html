				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a photocurable adhesive composition and its use in the optical field.<br>
It is a common practice in the art to coat at least one face of an ophthalmic lens with several coatings for imparting to the finished (ens additional or improved optical or mechanical properties.<br>
Thus, it is usual practice to coat at least one face of an ophthalmic lens, typically made of an organic glass material, with successively, starting from the face of the lens, an impact resistant coating (impact resistant primer), a scratch resistant coating (hard coat), an anti-reflecting coating and, optionally, a hydrophobic top coat. Other coatings such as polanzed coating, photochromic or dying coating may also be applied onto one or both faces of the ophthalmic lens.<br>
Numerous processes and methods have been proposed for coating a face of an ophthalmic lens and are disclosed.<br>
US 2003/0017340 describes one process or method for transferring a coating from at least one mold part onto at least a geometrically defined surface of a lens blank comprising :<br>
-	providing a lens blank having at least one geometrically defined surface;<br>
-	providing a support or mold part having an internal surface bearing a coating and an external surface;<br>
-	depositing on said geometrically defined surface of said lens blank or on said coating a pre-measured amount of a curable adhesive composition;<br>
-	moving relatively to each other the lens blank and the support to either bring the coating into contact with curable   adhesive   composition   or   bring   the   curable<br><br>
adhesive composition into contact with the geometrically defined surface of the lens blank;<br>
-	applying a sufficient pressure onto the external surface of<br>
the support so that the thickness of a final adhesive layer<br>
once the curable composition cured is less than 100<br>
micrometers;<br>
-	curing the layer of adhesive composition; and<br>
-	withdrawing the support or mold part to recover the lens<br>
blank with the coating adhered onto the geometrically<br>
defined surface of said lens blank.<br>
By pre-measured amount, one means a sufficient amount of curable adhesive composition to obtain transfer and adhesion of the coating to the lens blank.<br>
Preferably the coating is transferred to the back surface of the lens blank (back side treatment or BST).<br>
The curable adhesive composition not only must allow a quick and safe transfer of the coating from the support onto the lens blank surface and a good adhesion of the coating onto the lens blank surface but also must not impair the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting ophthalmic lens, such as good adhesion, haze, no application stain and resistance to thermal cracking (critical temperature).<br>
Application stain refers to the existence of an area of increased haze level, on the lens blank, coinciding with the initial adhesive composition application area. The Haze may be observed if the adhesive composition was allowed to sit on the lens blank surface for longer than 20 seconds before undergoing the surface transfer process.<br>
Additionally, the cured adhesive composition layer must have a refractive index close to that of the substrate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thus, an object of the invention is to provide a photocurable adhesive composition which overcomes the drawbacks of the prior<br>
art curable adhesive compositions, in particular for use in a coating transfer process;<br>
a further object of the invention is to provide a photocurable adhesive composition as above which not only results in a good adhesion of the coating onto the substrate but also does not impair the optical and mechanical properties of the final product, in particular haze, application stain and resistance to thermal cracking.<br>

In the present invention, the photo-initiator is added in usual amounts, namely from 0,1 to 5 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 5<br>
parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the photopolymerizable monomer of the composition.<br>
The preferred photocurable adhesive composition of the invention have, after curing, a high refractive index n25D , ranging<br>
from 1 .52 to 1 .65, preferably 1 .53 to 1 .65, more preferably 1 .56 to 1.6, typically about 1.57 and a glass transition temperature Tg of preferably at least 60°C and more preferably at least 70°C, and even better at least 80°C.<br>
The photocurable adhesive composition is particularly appropriate for use in coating transfer processes, lamination and over molding processes, in particular for making ophthalmic lenses and other optical articles.<br>
Use of the photocurable composition of the invention will now be described as applied to a coating transfer process for making coated substrates such as ophthalmic lenses. It shall be understood that the photocurable adhesive composition of the invention may be used in any coating transfer method and not solely in the process described below.<br>
The substrate is preferably a lens blank. Preferably, the main surface of the blank onto which the coating is transferred, is a geometrically defined surface.<br>
By geometrically defined surface of the lens blank or of a mold part, there is meant either an optical surface, that is a surface of required geometry and smoothness or a surface having a required geometry but that may still exhibit some roughness, such as a lens blank that has been grinded and fined, but not polished to the required geometry. The surface roughness typically ranges from Sq 10"3 μm to 1 μm, preferably from 10"3 to 0.5 μm and most preferably from 10"3 to 0.1 μm.<br>
Sq : Quadratic mean of the deviations from the mean<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Computes the efficient value for the amplitudes of the surfaces (RMS). This parameter is included in the EUR 15178 EN report (Commission of the European Communities) Stout et al.<br>
1993 : The development of methods for the characterisation of roughness in three dimensions.<br>
The roughness (Sq) was measured by P-10 Long Scan of KLA-Tencor.<br>
The measurement condition was under 2 μm tip 1 mg force 10 scans 500 urn long 2000 data points.<br>
By optical surface, there is meant a surface of the lens blank or of a mold part that has been ground, fined and polished or molded to required geometry and smoothness.<br>
An important feature of the process of the present invention is that the transfer of the coating onto the geometrically defined surface of the lens blank is performed without any substantial compression of the blank and thus without any risk of deformation of the blank geometry and in particular of the geometrically defined surfaces thereof.<br>
Nevertheless, the pressure exerted on the external surface of the support is preferably substantially maintained at least up to the gelling of the adhesive composition. Maintaining the pressure can be effected through the use of an inflatable membrane placed on the external surface of the support.<br>
Preferably, the applied pressure ranges from 5 to 50 Psi (0.35 to 3.5 kgf/cm2), and more specifically 0.3 to 3 kgf/cm2.<br>
Most preferred range is 5 to 20 Psi (0.35 to 1.40 kgf/cm2).<br>
Using the above described process, coatings may be transferred successively or simultaneously to both front and rear geometrically defined surfaces of the lens blank. The transfer of the coatings may also be performed only to one side of the lens blank, preferably to the back side (or rear side).<br>
The coating support or carrier may simply be a thin supporting film made of an appropriate material such as a plastic material, for example a polycarbonate film. The coating support is preferably a mold part made of any appropriate material, preferably made of a plastic material especially a thermoplastic material and in particular of polycarbonate.<br>
It is also possible to use a coating support or carrier on the surface of which the adhesive has already been applied and possibly gelled. In that case, a film may be used to cover and protect the surface of the adhesive. The protective film is removed before using the carrier.<br>
The working surface of the mold part may have a relief organized according to a pattern, in other words, may be microstructured and may confer to the final lens an optical surface having the properties imparted by the microstructure (for example antireflective properties).<br>
Different techniques for obtaining a microstructured mold part are disclosed in W099/29494.<br>
The mold part or carrier may be obtained by using known processes such as surfacing, thermoforming, vacuum thermoforming, thermoforming/compression, injection molding, injection/compression molding.<br>
The support, typically a mold part, may be rigid or flexible, but is preferably flexible. Using rigid mold parts necessitates to have a large number of mold parts each comprising a geometrically defined surface whose geometry is adapted to a specific geometry of the geometrically defined surface of a lens blank. In order to avoid the necessity of having such a huge number of different mold parts, the mold part is preferably a flexible mold part, in particular a flexible mold part made of a plastic material such as polycarbonate. When using this flexible mold part it is only necessary to provide the mold part with a surface the geometry of which conforms to the general shape of the optical surface of the lens blanks onto which the coating is to be transferred, either a concave or convex shape, but it is not necessary that this surface strictly corresponds to the geometry of the lens blank surface to be coated. Thus, the same mold part can be used for transferring coatings onto lens blanks having surfaces of different specific geometries. Generally, the flexible mold part has two parallel main surfaces and consequently has an even thickness.<br><br>
The coating bearing surface of the flexible mold is preferably spherical.<br>
Flexible mold parts would typically have a thickness of 0.2 to 5 mm, preferably of 0.3 to 5 mm. More preferably, the flexible mold part is made of polycarbonate, and in this case the thickness is from 0.5 to 1 mm.<br>
It has been found that the best embodiments of the transfer process are achieved if specific requirements regarding the base curvatures of the mold part and lens blank are fulfilled.<br>
In this patent application, when one refers to the base curvature of the mold part, one means the base curvature of the working surface of the mold part, that is to say the surface which bears the coatings to be transferred to the lens or lens blank.<br>
In the same way, base curvature of the lens or lens blank means the base curvature of the surface to which the coatings are going to be transferred from the above cited mold part.<br>
In this application, the base curvature has the following definition:<br>
-	For a spheric surface, having a radius of curvature R,<br>
Base curvature (or base ) = 530/R ( R in mm ); such kind of definition is quite classical in the art<br>
-	For a toric surface, there are two radii of curvature and one<br>
calculates, according to the above formula, two base curvatures<br>
BR, Br withBR
For a coating transfer to a spherical back side of a lens or lens blank, in order to avoid distortions, in particular when using a flexible mold part, the base curvature (BC) of the flexible mold part (front side) must be slightly higher than the base curvature (BL) of the geometrically defined surface of the lens or the lens blank on which the coating is to be transferred. However, BC shall not be too high in order to avoid cracking of the coating during the transfer process or an optical power outside tolerance of the Optical Laboratory Standard Z80.1 after the transfer.<br>
Typically, for a spheric lens or lens blank, base curvature BL of the lens or lens blank and base curvature BC of the flexible mold part shall satisfy the relationship :<br>
Preferably<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
For a coating transfer to a toric back side of a lens or a lens blank (cylindric lens or lens blank), having two principal meridians, of radii R and r with R&gt;r, it is possible to calculate two base curvatures BLR and BLr corresponding respectively to radii R and r defining the toric surface.<br>
Base curvatures of the lens BLR and BLr and the base curvature of the flexible mold part shall satisfy the following relationship:<br>
BLR 
a)	if BLr -BLR £3.5<br>
0<bc-blr blr preferably></bc-blr>
0.2<bc-blr></bc-blr>
b)	if BLr-BLR &gt; 3.5<br>
BLR 
When using a rigid mould part, preferably the base curvature of the mould part (BC) is the same as the base curvature of the lens or lens blank (BL).<br>
Preferably, when moving relatively to each other the mold part and the blank, the contact between coating(s) and curable adhesive composition or between adhesive composition and lens blank<br>
geometrically defined surface occurs respectively in the center area of the coated mold part or in the center area of the lens blank geometrically defined surface.<br>
In particular in the case of a flexible mold part, the convex front face of the mold part may have a shorter radius of curvature than the concave surface of the blank to be coated. Thus, pressure is applied at the center and the mold part is then deformed to conform to the blank surface. The glue layer is formed starting from the center of the blank, which avoids entrapping air bubbles within the final cured adhesive composition layer. The same will be true using the concave surface of a mold part of longer radius of curvature than a convex blank surface to be coated.<br>
As previously mentioned, transfer from a flexible mold part may be effected using an inflatable membrane.<br>
The inflatable membrane can be made of any elastomeric material which can be sufficiently deformed by pressurization with appropriate fluid for urging the flexible mold part against the lens or lens blank in conformity with the surface geometry of the lens or the lens blank.<br>
The inflatable membrane can be made of any appropriate elastomeric material. Typically, the inflatable membrane has a thickness ranging from 0.50 mm to 5.0 mm and an elongation of 100 to 800%, and a durometer 10 to 100 Shore A.<br>
For UV curing, then a transparent material shall be selected, for example a transparent silicone rubber or other transparent rubbers or latexes: the UV light is preferably irradiated from the mold side.<br>
The pressure applied to the mold part by the inflatable membrane will preferably range from 30kPa to 150kPa and will depend on the lens or lens blank and flexible mold part sizes and curvatures. Of course, the pressure needs to be maintained onto the flexible mold part and the lens or lens blank until the glue or adhesive is sufficiently cured so that enough adhesion of the coating to the lens or lens blank is obtained.<br>
The lens blank can be a lens having one or both of its faces surfaced or casted to the required geometry. (A lens having only<br>
one of its faces surfaced or casted to the required geometry is called a semi-finished lens).<br>
Preferably, the lens blank has a first face conferring progressive power and a second face conferring non-progressive power, but of spherical or torical shape onto which coating transfer according to the invention process is preferably performed. Preferably, the progressive face is the front face of the blank.<br>
The lens blank can also be a semi-finished lens wherein one face of the lens, preferably the front face of the lens has previously been treated with an appropriate coating (anti-reflective, hard coat, etc...) and the remaining face, preferably the rear face, of the lens is coated using the transfer process of the invention. The lens blank can be a polarized lens.<br>
Although the following description makes reference to the use of a preferred flexible mold part, it shall be understood that the described process can also be implemented using rigid mold parts.<br>
Referring now to the drawings and in particular to figures 1A to 1C, a lens blank 1 having a concave surface 2 is placed on a supporting element 3 with its concave surface 2 facing upwardly. A pre-measured drop of a UV curable adhesive composition 4 according to the invention is then deposited onto the surface 2 of the lens blank 1. A flexible mould part 5 having a convex optical surface, which has been previously coated with a prescribed coating 6, is placed onto a supporting element 7 with its surface bearing the optical coating facing downwardly.<br>
Deposition of coating 6 on the surface of the flexible mold part 5 can be done through any usual deposition process employed in the optical field, such as vacuum deposition, spin coating, brush coating, dip coating etc....Of course, the deposition process will depend on the nature of the coating layer or layers deposited on the surface of the flexible mold part 5.<br>
Thereafter the supporting elements 3, 7 are moved relatively to each other to bring into contact coating 6 and UV curable adhesive composition drop 4 and a pressure is exerted to the external surface of the mold part opposite to the coating in such a<br>
manner that the UV curable adhesive composition drop will spread on the surface 2 of the lens blank 1 and on the coating 6. However, the exerted pressure shall only be sufficient for spreading the drop of adhesive composition in order to obtain the required thickness for the final cured film (generally 100 urn or less) but insufficient to impart any deformation to the lens blank 1.<br>
As shown in figure 1B, the assembly formed by the lens blank 1, the adhesive composition film 4, the coating 6 and the mold part15 is then placed into a device for UV curing the adhesive composition film 4. After UV curing of the film 4, the mold part 5 is withdrawn and a blank 1 having a coating 6 adhered onto its concave surface 2 is recovered as shown in figure 1C.<br>
Referring now to figures 2A to 2C, there is shown a similar process as described in connection with figures 1A to 1B but in which both surfaces of lens blank 1 are coated with a coating by the transfer method of the invention.<br>
As shown in figure 2A, a flexible mould part 8, for example a mould part made of polycarbonate having a thickness of 1 mm, whose concave surface has been previously coated with an optical coating 9 is placed onto a supporting element 3. A pre-measured drop 10 of a UV curable adhesive composition is then deposited onto coating 9. A lens blank 1 is then placed on mold part 8 with its convex surface 2' in contact with glue drop 10. A pre-measured UV curable adhesive composition drop is then deposited on concave surface 2 of lens blank 1. A flexible mold part 5, for example a polycarbonate mold part of 1 mm thickness, whose convex surface has been previously coated with an optical coating 6 is placed on a supporting element 7. Supporting elements 3, 7 are then moved relatively to each other to bring coating 6 into contact with adhesive composition drop 4 and a pressure is exerted on at least the external surface of one of the mold part to spread the adhesive composition drops 4 and 10 to form films. As indicated previously, the pressure exerted must only be sufficient to spread the adhesive composition drops and form films of required thicknesses after curing but insufficient to create any deformation in the lens blank 1.<br>
Thereafter, the assembly formed by the mold parts, optical coatings, adhesive composition films and lens blank is placed into a UV curing, device where the adhesive composition films 4, 10 are UV cured.<br>
After completion of curing of the adhesive composition films, mold parts 5 and 8 are withdrawn and a finished lens having optical coatings 5, 6 adhered to both surfaces of the lens blank 1 is recovered, as shown in figure 2C.<br>
Figures 3A and 3B are schematic views of a third embodiment of the process of the invention in which the transfer of the coating is performed using a flexible mold part or carrier which is urged against the lens blank surface using an inflatable membrane.<br>
Figure 3A shows the lens blank, flexible carrier and inflatable membrane before pressurization and inflation of the membrane, whereas figure 3B shows the same after pressurization and inflatation of the membrane.<br>
Referring to figure 3A, a lens blank 1, for example a tonic lens blank is placed in a lens blank support with its geometrically defined surface 1a facing outwardly.<br>
A drop of photocurable adhesive composition 3 is deposited at the center of the geometrically defined surface 1a of the lens blank 1.<br>
A thin flexible carrier 4, for example a spheric carrier, having a transferable coating 5 deposited on one of its faces, is placed on the adhesive composition drop 3 so that the transferable coating 5 is in contact with the adhesive drop 3. The base curvature of the flexible carrier 4 is slightly higher than the base curvature of the geometrically defined surface 1a of a lens blank 1.<br>
The whole assembly is place in front of an inflatable membrane apparatus 10.<br>
The inflatable membrane apparatus 10 comprises a fluid accumulator 11, for example an air accumulator provided with fluid port 12, for example an air port connected to a pressurized fluid source (not represented) for introducing pressurized fluid within the<br>
accumulator and also evacuating pressurized fluid form the accumulator, the upper face of the accumulator 10 comprises a light transparent portion 13, for example a UV transparent quartz glass portion, whereas the lower face of the accumulator 10 comprises a transparent inflatable membrane 14 in register with the transparent quartz glass 13.<br>
As shown in figure 3A, the apparatus 10 further comprises a guiding means 15 for laterally guiding the inflatable membrane 14 during inflatation thereof. More specifically, this guiding means comprises a trunconical part or funnel 15 projecting outwardly form the lower face of the accumulator 10 and whose greater base is obturated by the inflatable membrane and whose smaller base is a circular opening having a diameter at least equal to the base diameter of the flexible carrier 4 but preferably slightly larger (up to 5mm larger...).<br>
Typically, the funnel height will range from 10 to 50 mm, preferably 10 to 25 mm, and will have a taper of 10 to 90°, preferably 30 to 50°.<br>
Finally, a light source, for example a UV light source 16 is placed behind the accumulator 10 in front of the transparent quartz plate 13.<br>
Generally, the assembly comprising the lens blank holder 2, the lens blank 1, the adhesive composition drop 3 and the flexible carrier 4 is placed so that the rim of the flexible carrier 4 be within the plan of the rim of the smaller base opening of funnel 15 or separated therefrom by a distance up to 50 mm, preferably up to 20 mm.<br>
As shown in figure 3B, a pressurized fluid, such as pressurized air, is introduced into the accumulator 11 from an external source (not represented) through entrance 12. The pressure increase within the accumulator, inflates the inflatable membrane 14 uniformly urges the flexible carrier against the lens blank 1, while uniformly spreading the adhesive 3.<br>
The adhesive composition is then UV-cured.<br>
After completion of the curing step, the lens blank 1 is disassembled from the holder 2 and the flexible carrier 4 is removed to recover a lens blank 1 whose geometrically defined surface 1a bears the transferred coating 5.<br>
Using the funnel type of apparatus just described, a good coating transfer is obtained, with good optical quality meeting the America Optical laboratory Standard (ANSI Z80.1-1987) as far as the power, cylinder, prism and distortion are concerned.<br>
The membrane guiding means (funnel) is very important to let the membrane expand in good shape and direction for applying an even pressure on the flexible carrier through the lens blank without any extra pressure on the carrier and lens blank edges.<br>
As previously mentioned, the thickness of the final adhesive composition layer after curing is less than 100μm preferably less than 80um, most preferably less than 50 urn and usually 1 to 30 urn.<br>
The substrates which are highly preferred for the process of the invention are made of any thermoplastic material, in particular, suitable for making optical lenses such as polycarbonate.<br>
However, even if they are not preferred, substrates made of thermosetting (cross linked) materials such as diethyleneglycol bis allylcarbonate polymer (CR39®PPG), polyurethane, polythiourethane, episulfide high index material can be used.<br>
The substrate may optionally contain photochromic compounds.<br>
Preferably, the substrate has a very high refractive index, i.e. a refractive index, n", of 1.56 or more, typically from 1.56 to 1.74 and preferably from 1.57 to 1.59.<br>
A preferred substrate material is polycarbonate (PC).<br>
The transferred coating may comprise any coating layer or stack of coating layers classically used in the optical field, such as a hydrophobic top coat, an anti-reflective coating layer, an anti-abrasion coating layer, an impact resistant coating layer, a polarized coating layer, a photochromic coating layer, an optical-electronical coating, an electric-photochromic coating, a dying<br>
coating layer, a printed layer such as a logo or a stack of two or more of these coating layers.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, it is transferred to the geometrically defined surface of the lens blank a stack comprising:<br>
-	optionally, a hydrophobic top coat;<br>
-	an antireflective stack, generally comprising inorganic<br>
material such as metal oxide or silica;<br>
-	an anti abrasion (hard) coat, preferably comprising a<br>
hydrolyzate of one or more epoxysilane (s) and optionally<br>
one ore more inorganic filler(s) such as colloidal silica;<br>
-	optionally,   an   impact   resistant   primer,   preferably   a<br>
polyurethane latex or an acrylic latex;<br>
each of the layers of the stack being deposited onto the<br>
support in the above recited order.<br>
The method of the invention is particularly interesting for transferring the whole stack comprising "top coat, antireflective coat, hard coat and primer coat".<br>
Generally the thickness of the antireflective coat or stack ranges from 80 nm to 800 nm and preferably 100 nm to 500 nm.<br>
The thickness of the hard coat preferably ranges from 1 to 10 micrometers, preferably from 2 to 6 micrometers. The thickness of the primer coat preferably ranges from 0.5 to 3 micrometers.<br>
Typically, the total thickness of the coating to be transferred is 1 to 500 urn, but is preferably less than 50 urn, more preferably less than 20 micrometers, or even better 10 urn or less.<br>
The following examples illustrate the present invention.<br>
In the examples multilayer coatings deposited on a 6.1 base<br>
back curve, 0.5 mm thick PC carrier were transferred onto the<br>
surface and polished, untreated back surfaces of polycarbonate<br>
lenses	(-2.00 D, 5.1 base back curve) using the above<br>
described  coating transfer process and  a flexible membrane apparatus.<br>
Multilayer coating<br>
In all the examples, the multilayer coating comprises hydrophobic top coat/anti-reflective coating/hard coating/primer coating (HMC).<br>
STEP 1 : Protecting and releasing coating<br>
The composition of the protecting and releasing coating was as follows:  <br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
The PC carrier is cleaned using soapy water and dried with compressed air. The carrier convex surface is then coated with the above protecting coating composition via spin coating with application speed of 600 rpm for 3 seconds and dry speed of 1200 rpm for 6 seconds. The coating is cured using Fusion System H+ bulb at a rate of 1.524 m/minute (5 feet per minute).<br>
STEP 2 : Hvdrophobic top coat and anti-reflective (AR) coating<br>
The PC carrier after deposition of the protecting coating is vacuum coated as follows :<br>
A/ Standard Vacuum AR Treatment: The Vacuum AR treatment is accomplished in a standard box coater using well known vacuum evaporation practices. The following is one procedure for obtaining the VAR on the mold : 1. The carrier having the protective coating already applied on the<br>
surface, is loaded into a standard box coater and the chamber is<br>
pumped to a high vacuum level. 2.<br>
3.	Hydrophobia  coating   (Chemical  =  Shin   Etsu   KP801M)  is<br>
deposited onto the surface of the carrier using a thermal<br>
evaporation technique, to a thickness in the range of 2-15 nm.<br>
4.	The dielectric multilayer AR coating, consisting of a stack of<br>
sublayers of high and low refractive index materials is then<br>
deposited, in reverse of the normal  order.  Details of this<br>
deposition are as such :<br>
The optical thicknesses of the alternating low and high refractive index layers are presented in the table (They are deposited in the indicated order, from the mold surface): <br>

 A preferred stack is a stack wherein the low index material is Si02 and the high index material is Zr02.<br>
B/At the completion of the deposition of the four-layer anti-reflection stack, a thin layer of Si02l comprising of a physical thickness of 1-50 nm, is deposited. This layer is to promote adhesion between the oxide anti-reflection stack and a lacquer hard-coating which will be deposited on the coated mold at a later time.<br>

Testing and inspection procedures<br>
-	Adhesion is measured using the cross-hatch adhesion<br>
test according to ISTM 02010, using 3M SCOTCH® n°600<br>
transparent tape.<br>
25 squares are formed. Adhesion is rated as follows :  (Table Removed)<br><br>
-	Resistance to thermal cracking  is determined by the<br>
measure of the critical temperature (Tc) according to<br>
ISTM method n°02032.<br>
The critical temperature Tc of an anti-reflective treated lens is that temperature at which crazing (fine cracking) of the anti-reflective treatment is first noted by visual inspection. Lenses are placed in a temperature controlled oven (50°C to start) for one hour, then removed and quickly examined for crazing. If no crazing is noted, the lenses are then placed in an oven, 10°C higher in temperature than the previous oven. The process is repeated until crazing is noted, or the lens survives 100°C.<br>
If crazing is found on a lens immediately after removal from the oven, but is not visible 24 hours later (kept at room temperature), the reported critical temperature is modified with a "+" suffix.<br>
A coated lens is considered as resistant to thermal cracking if Tc &gt; 60°C, preferably Tc &gt; 65°C. However, a coated lens having a Tc &gt; 50°C is considered acceptable.<br>
-	Haze and application stain levels were visually determined<br>
using a standard   R17 application lamp with Vita-Life 15 Watt<br>
fluorescent bulb and then a mini-spot 41601 lamp manufactured by<br>
OSRAM.<br>
The lenses were viewed with the incident light approximately normal to the lens surface. Haze is defined as a general cloudiness or diffusion of the light over a large area of the lens. The inspection is made visually.<br>
The mini-spot lamp is more accurate than the lamp with the Vita-Life bulb.<br>

Example of calculation of the solubility parameters.<br>
The following example will show, step by step, how the solubility parameter for neopentylglycol diacrylate was calculated. The solubility parameter calculation is based on the technique of group contribution, which assumes that each functional group in a molecule contributes additively to a thermodynamic property. Hoy's group contribution values are derived from vapor pressure measurements.<br>
The energy of vaporization is given by :<br>
ΔEv =ΣjnjΔj<br>
where nj is the number of groups of type j in the molecule, and Aej is the energy of vaporization contribution for group j.<br>
Hoy's (and others) group contribution values are reported as molar attraction constants (F), which are related to the energy of vaporization in the following way :<br>
where V1 is the molar volume of the molecule. The solubility parameter (5) for a molecule is related to the molar attraction constants in the following way : <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
where pij is the density of the molecule, and MI is the molecular weight.<br>
The molecule is deconstructed into the different functional groups which are listed by Hoy. Figure 1 shows a ball-and-stick drawing of neopentylglycol diacrylate. The different functional groups have been numbered, with multiple occurances of the same functional group being given the same number.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The group contribution values of each functional group occurence are tabulated (as shown in Table 4).<br>
