Polypropylene composition with improved optics for film and moulding<br>
applications<br>
The present invention refers to a polypropylene composition with low<br>
amounts of volatiles and improved optical properties comprising a<br>
propylene homo- or random copolymer with at least one comonomer<br>
selected from alpha-olefins with 2 or 4-8 carbon atoms and a comonomer<br>
content of not more than 8.0 wt% which has been polymerized in the<br>
presence of a Ziegler-Natta catalyst. The inventive polypropylene<br>
composition is especially applicable for the preparation of films and<br>
injection molded articles.<br>
Polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene are widely used for<br>
film and packaging applications and increasingly applied also in food and<br>
medical area.<br>
It is desired to produce films and molded articles with superior optical<br>
properties in gloss, transparency, clarity, and haze. It is well known in the<br>
art to optimize those optical properties by subjecting polypropylene<br>
compositions applicable for the production of films or molded articles to a<br>
vis-breaking step by which the polypropylene chains are broken with<br>
peroxide and a higher melt flow rate is achieved. Examples for vis-broken<br>
polypropylene compositions applicable for the production of films and<br>
molding applications are described in e.g. EP-351208, EP-799839 or EP-<br>
980877.<br>
However, several other key properties of polypropylene films and molding<br>
application are affected negatively by this vis-breaking step such as the<br>
dynamic coefficient of friction (CoF), for which a low value is required for<br>
a good winding quality and also the following conversion steps. For good<br>
winding quality a CoF of approx. 0.35 (depending on the film properties<br>
 <br>
and film thickness) and for conversion a CoF below 0.2 is technically<br>
necessary and therefore a market requirement. In WO 2005/111095 a<br>
process for producing a polypropylene film is disclosed in which after vis-<br>
breaking a film with a small CoF is obtained.<br>
Further, vis-breaking negatively affects the stiffness especially of molded<br>
articles and causes impurities within the film or molded article in the form<br>
of volatiles. However, the standards issued by the "Food and Drug<br>
Administration" (FDA) or other respective authorities for food and medical<br>
applications require low amounts of volatiles within the packaging.<br>
Moreover in case food or medical products shall be packaged it is desired that<br>
the sealing of said products can be effected at rather low temperatures to avoid<br>
any risk of thermal damage. Thus, especially for film applications good heat<br>
sealing properties are desirable. In order to fulfill its function as good<br>
heat-sealing agent, a film should have a low seal initiation temperature<br>
(SIT).<br>
It is further desirable for pharmaceutical packaging where the material is mostly<br>
sterilized that the packaging material is not affected in mechanical and optical<br>
properties by the sterilization procedure. The most common sterilization<br>
procedures are the use of heat (steam), radiation (beta radiation, electrons or<br>
gamma radiation) or chemicals (usually ethylene oxide). Steam sterilization,<br>
usually carried out in a temperature range of 120 to 130°C, results mostly<br>
in post-crystallisation and physical ageing effects of the polypropylene.<br>
Moreover, the material tends to become stiffer and more brittle. Also<br>
optical disturbances are severely observed and significantly increase the<br>
haze of transparent articles.<br>
It is object of the present invention to overcome the above stated<br>
problems and to provide a polypropylene composition which when cast<br>
into a film show all above described desired properties.<br>
 <br>
The present invention resides in the finding that by avoiding vis-breaking<br>
of a polypropylene composition emissions and volatiles in the resulting<br>
film or molded article can be greatly diminished. It has now surprisingly<br>
been found that Ziegler-Natta catalysts can be used for polymerizing<br>
propylene homo- or copolymers without need for vis-breaking which are<br>
suitable for the production of films and molded articles with a good<br>
balance of optics and purity while maintaining good stiffness and<br>
toughness.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a polypropylene composition<br>
comprising a propylene homopolymer or a propylene random copolymer<br>
having at least one comonomer selected from alpha-olefins with 2 or 4-8<br>
carbon atoms and a comonomer content of not more than 8.0 wt%,<br>
wherein<br>
the propylene homo- or copolymer is polymerized in the presence of a<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalyst, and<br>
the polypropylene composition has a MWD of 2.0 to 6.0 and an MFR (2.16<br>
kg/230°C) of 4.0 g/10 min to 20.0 g/10 min, characterized in that the<br>
polypropylene composition has not been subjected to a vis-breaking<br>
step.<br>
It is preferred that the polypropylene composition has a weight average<br>
molecular weight Mw of 200 to 500 kg/mol, more preferably 250 to 400<br>
kg/mol, and a number average molecular weight Mn of 50 to 150 kg/mol,<br>
more preferably 70 to 100 kg/mol, determined by GPC according to ISO<br>
16014-1, and-4<br>
The polypropylene composition has a MWD of 2.0 to 6.0, preferably 3.0 to<br>
5.5, most preferably 3.5 to 5.0.<br>
 <br>
It is further preferred that the inventive polypropylene composition has a<br>
melt flow rate MFR (2.16 kg, 230°C) of 4.5 to 15 g/10 min, more preferably<br>
of 5 to 10 g/10 min.<br>
The MFR (2.16 kg, 230°C) for polypropylene is determined according to<br>
ISO 1133. Melt flow rate and average molecular weight are inversely<br>
related to each other, i.e. higher melt flow rate is equivalent to lower<br>
average molecular weight and vice versa. Further, the higher the melt flow<br>
rate, the lower the viscosity of the polymeric material.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that the inventive polypropylene<br>
composition shows an extremely low amount of volatiles and concurrently<br>
provides good optical properties especially in gloss, transparency, haze<br>
and clarity before and after sterilization when cast into a film or molded<br>
article although the inventive polypropylene composition is not subjected<br>
to a vis-breaking step. Further, the articles made from the inventive<br>
polypropylene composition maintain good mechanical properties<br>
especially in behalf of stiffness and toughness and moreover have a low<br>
coefficient of friction.<br>
Preferably, the polypropylene composition has an amount of volatiles of<br>

The propylene homo- or random copolymer of the present invention may<br>
consist of a single propylene homopolymer or random copolymer, but<br>
may also comprise a mixture of different propylene homo- and/or random<br>
copolymers whereby also only different homopolymers or only different<br>
random copolymers may be mixed. It may also comprise a mixture of at<br>
least one homopolymer with at least one random copolymer. This also<br>

copolymer.<br>
It is preferred that the propylene homo- or copolymer has a content of<br>
xylene solubles of not more than 8.0 wt%, more preferably from 1.0 wt%<br>
to 7.0 wt%.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the inventive propylene homo- or random<br>

The polymerization process for the production of the inventive propylene<br>
homo- or random copolymer may be a continuous process or a batch<br>
process utilizing known methods and operating in liquid phase, optionally<br>
in the presence of an inert diluent, or in gas phase or by mixed liquid-gas<br>
techniques.<br>
Accordingly, the propylene homo- or random copolymers may be<br>
produced by single- or multistage process polymerizations of propylene<br>
or propylene and at least one comonomer selected from alpha-olefins<br>
with 2 or 4-8 carbon atoms such as bulk polymerization, gas phase<br>
polymerization, slurry polymerization, solution polymerization or<br>
combinations thereof using Ziegler-Natta catalysts described below.<br>
Preferably, a homo- or copolymer is made either in one loop or two loop<br>
reactors or in a combination of loop and gas phase reactor. Those<br>
processes are well known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Preferred reactor arrangements for producing a propylene homo- or<br>
random copolymer according to the invention are two consecutive loop<br>
reactors or a loop reactor followed by a gas phase reactor.<br>
Before the catalyst system is used in the actual polymerization process it<br>
is typically pre-polymerized with small amounts of alpha-olefins,<br>
preferably propylene, in order to enhance catalyst performance and to<br>
improve the morphology of the end product.<br>
In the first polymerization step of the process the optionally pre-<br>
polymerized catalyst system and a monomer feed comprised of<br>
propylene and optionally at least one comonomer selected from an alpha-<br>
olefin with 2 or 4 to 8 carbon atoms is fed to a reactor.<br>
 <br>
Polymerization can be carried out in the presence of the catalyst system<br>
at temperatures lower than 110 °C, preferably between 60 and 100 °C,<br>
more preferably between 70 to 90 °C and pressures in the range of 10 to<br>
100 bar, preferably 30 to 70 bar.<br>
Hydrogen is added, when desired, into the first reactor for adjusting the<br>
molecular weight of the polymer, as conventional.<br>
After polymerization is complete in the first reactor, the reaction medium<br>
is transferred into a second reactor, which can be a gas phase reactor. If<br>
the second reactor is also a loop reactor, the same range of<br>
polymerization conditions is available as for the first reactor.<br>
In the second reactor, if it is a gas phase reactor, the polymerization can<br>
be carried out at a temperature of 50 to 130 °C, preferably of 60 to 90 °C<br>
and at a pressure higher than 5 bar, preferably higher than 10 bar, more<br>
preferably between 15 and 35 bar. Propylene and optionally at least one<br>
comonomer selected from an alpha-olefin with 2 or 4 to 8 carbon atoms<br>
can be added into the second reactor. Hydrogen can also be added into<br>
the gas phase reactor, if desired.<br>
The precise control of the polymerization conditions and reaction<br>
parameters is within the state of the art. After polymerization in the first<br>
and the optional second reactor is finished, the polymer product is<br>
recovered by conventional procedures.<br>
The resulting polymer particles may be pelletized in a conventional<br>
compounding extruder with various additives, which are generally used in<br>
thermoplastic polymer compositions, such as stabilizers, antioxidants,<br>
acid neutralizing agents, ultraviolet absorbers, antistatic agents, slipping<br>
agents etc. in a total amount of not more than 5 wt%.<br>
 <br>
The catalyst system, which is used in the polymerization of the propylene<br>
homo- or random copolymers of the present invention, refers to a Ziegler-<br>

Ziegler-Natta olefin polymerization catalyst comprises a component in the<br>
form of particles having a predetermined size range which has been<br>
produced in a process comprising:<br>
a)	preparing a solution of a complex of a Group 2 metal and an<br>
electron donor by reacting a compound of said metal with said<br>
electron donor or a precursor thereof in an organic liquid reaction<br>
medium,<br>
b)	reacting said complex in solution with a compound of a transition<br>
metal, preferably of any of groups 4 - 6, to produce an emulsion<br>
the dispersed phase of which containing more than 50 mol% of the<br>

An electron donor compound to be reacted with the group 2 metal<br>
compound preferably is a mono- or diester of an aromatic carboxylic acid<br>

Said aromatic carboxylic acid ester or diester can be formed in situ by<br>
reaction of an aromatic carboxylic acid chloride or diacid dichloride with a<br>
C2-C16 alkanol and/or diol, and is preferably dioctyl phthalate or bis-(2-<br>
ethylhexyl) phthalate.<br>
The reaction for the preparation of the group 2 metal complex is generally<br>
carried out at a temperature of 20 to 80 °C, and in case that the group 2<br>
metal is magnesium, the preparation of the magnesium complex may<br>
advantageously be carried out at a temperature of 50 to 70 CC.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the production process of the catalyst a<br>
turbulence minimizing agent (TMA) is added to the reaction mixture<br>

Usually, said turbulence minimizing agent can be added in any process<br>
step before particle formation starts, i.e. at the latest before solidification<br>
of the emulsion, and is added to the emulsion in an amount of 1 to 1000<br>
ppm, preferably 5 to 100 ppm and more preferably 5 to 50 ppm, based on<br>

A preferred embodiment of the process for producing catalysts for<br>
preparing propylene homo- or random copolymers of the present<br>
invention comprises: preparing a solution of a magnesium complex by<br>
reacting alkoxy magnesium compound and an electron donor or<br>
precursor thereof in a C6-C10 aromatic liquid reaction medium comprising<br>
C6-C10 aromatic hydrocarbon or a mixture of C6-C10 aromatic hydrocarbon<br>
and Cs-C9 aliphatic hydrocarbon; reacting said magnesium complex with<br>
a compound of at least one fourvalent group 4 metal at a temperature<br>
greater than 10 °C and less than 60 °C, to produce an emulsion of a<br>
denser, TiCl4/toluene-insoluble, oil dispersed phase having a group 4<br>
metal/Mg mol ratio of 0.1 to 10 in an oil disperse phase having a group 4<br>
metal/Mg mol ratio of 10 to 100; maintaining the droplets of said<br>
dispersed phase within the size range of 5 to 200 micrometers by<br>
agitation in the presence of an emulsion stabilizer while heating the<br>
emulsion to solidify said droplets and adding turbulence minimizing agent<br>
 <br>
into the reaction mixture before solidifying said droplets of the dispersed<br>
phase, said turbulence minimizing agent being inert and soluble in the<br>
reaction mixture under reaction conditions; and solidifying said particles<br>
of the dispersed phase by heating and recovering the obtained catalyst<br>
particles.<br>
The said disperse and dispersed phases are thus distinguishable from<br>
one another by the fact that the denser oil, if contacted with a solution of<br>
titanium tetrachloride in toluene, will not dissolve in it. A suitable<br>
TiCl4/toluene solution for establishing this criterion would be one having a<br>
TiCl4/toluene mol ratio of 0.1 to 0.3. The disperse and dispersed phase<br>
are also distinguishable by the fact that the great preponderance of the<br>
Mg provided (as complex) for the reaction with the group 4 metal<br>
compound is present in the dispersed phase, as revealed by comparison<br>
of the respective group 4 metal /Mg mol ratios.<br>
In effect, therefore, virtually the entirety of the reaction product of the Mg<br>
complex with the group 4 metal, which is the precursor of the final<br>
catalyst, becomes the dispersed phase, and proceeds through further<br>
processing steps to the final dry particulate form. The disperse phase, still<br>
containing a useful quantity of group 4 metal, can be reprocessed for<br>
recovery of that metal.<br>
The production of a two-phase, rather than a single phase reaction<br>
product is encouraged by carrying out the Mg complex/group 4 metal<br>
compound reaction at low temperature, specifically above 10 °C but<br>
below 60 °C, preferably between 20 and 50 °C. Since the two phases will<br>
naturally tent to separate into a lower, denser phase and a supernatant<br>
lighter phase, it is necessary to maintain the reaction product as an<br>
emulsion by agitation, preferably in the presence of an emulsion<br>
stabilizer.<br>
 <br>
The resulting particles from the dispersed phase of the emulsion are of a<br>
size, shape (spherical) and uniformity which render the final catalyst<br>
extremely effective in olefin polymerization. This morphology is preserved<br>
during the heating to solidify the particles, and of course throughout the<br>
final washing and drying steps. It is, by contrast, difficult to the point of<br>
impossibility to achieve such morphology through precipitation, because<br>
of the fundamental uncontrollability of nucleation and growth, and the<br>
large number of variables which affect these events.<br>
The electron donor is preferably an aromatic carboxylic acid ester,<br>
particularly favored esters being dioctyl phthalate and bis-(2-ethylhexyl)<br>
phthalate. The donor may conveniently be formed in situ by reaction of an<br>
aromatic carboxylic acid chloride precursor with a C2-C16 alkanol and/or<br>
diol. The liquid medium preferably comprises toluene.<br>
Furthermore, emulsifying agents/emulsion stabilizers can be used<br>
additionally in a manner known in the art for facilitating the formation<br>
and/or stability of the emulsion. For said purposes e.g. surfactants, e.g. a<br>
class based on acrylic or methacrylic polymers can be used. Preferably,<br>
said emulsion stabilizers are acrylic or methacrylic polymers, in particular<br>
those with medium sized ester side chains having more than 10,<br>
preferably more than 12 carbon atoms and preferably less than 30, and<br>
preferably 12 to 20 carbon atoms in the ester side chain. Particularly<br>
preferred are unbranched C12 to C20 acrylates such as poly(hexadecyl)-<br>
methacrylate and poly(octadecyl)-methacrylate.<br>
It has been found that the best results are obtained when the group 4<br>
metal/Mg mol ratio of the denser oil is 1 to 5, preferably 2 to 4, and that of<br>
the disperse phase oil is 55 to 65. Generally, the ratio of the mol ratio of<br>
group 4 metal/Mg in the disperse phase oil to that in the denser oil is at<br>
least 10.<br>
 <br>
Solidification of the dispersed phase droplets by heating is suitably<br>
carried out at a temperature of 70 to 150 °C, usually at 90 to 110 °C.<br>
The finally obtained catalyst is desirably in the form of particles having<br>
average size ranges of 5 to 200 micrometers, preferably 10 to 100<br>
micrometers, more preferably 20 to 50 micrometers.<br>
The reagents can be added to the aromatic reaction medium in any order.<br>
However, it is preferred that in a first step the alkoxy magnesium<br>
compound is reacted with a carboxylic acid halide precursor of the<br>
electron donor to form an intermediate; and in a second step the obtained<br>
product is further reacted with the group 4 metal. The magnesium<br>
compound preferably contains from 1 to 20 carbon atoms per alkoxy<br>
group, and the carboxyl acid should contain at least 8 carbon atoms.<br>
Reaction of the magnesium compound, carboxylic acid halide and<br>
alcohol proceeds satisfactorily at temperatures in the range of 20 to 80<br>
°C, preferably 50 to 70 °C. The product of that reaction, the °Mg<br>
complex", is reacted with the group 4 metal compound at a lower<br>
temperature, to bring about the formation of a two-phase, oil-in-oil,<br>
product.<br>
The reaction medium used as solvent can be aromatic or a mixture of<br>
aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, the latter one containing preferably<br>
5 to 9 carbon atoms, more preferably 5 to 7 carbon atoms, or mixtures<br>
thereof. Preferably, the liquid reaction medium used as solvent in the<br>
reaction is aromatic and is more preferably selected from hydrocarbons<br>
such as substituted and unsubstituted benzenes, preferably from<br>
alkylated benzenes, even more preferably from toluene and the xylenes,<br>
and most preferably being toluene. The molar ratio of said aromatic<br>
medium to magnesium is preferably less than 10, for instance from 4 to<br>
10, preferably from 5 to 9.<br>
 <br>

magnesium compound selected from the group consisting of dialkyl<br>

of dialkyloxy magnesiums, diaryloxy magnesiums, alkyloxy magnesium<br>
halides, aryloxy magnesium halides, alkyl magnesium alkoxides, aryl<br>
magnesium alkoxides, and alkyl magnesium aryloxides.<br>
The magnesium dialkoxide may be the reaction product of a magnesium<br>

group and R" is an octyl group, i.e. the dialkyl magnesium compound is<br>
butyloctyl magnesium, most preferably the dialkyl magnesium compound<br>
is Mg[(Bu)1.5(Oct)0.5].<br>
Dialkyl magnesium, alkyl magnesium alkoxide or magnesium dihalide can<br>
react with a polyhydric alcohol R(OH)m, with m being in the range of 2-4,<br>
or a monohydric alcohol ROH or mixtures thereof.<br>
Typical C2 to C6 polyhydric alcohol may be straight-chain or branched<br>

isoamyl alcohol, tert. butyl carbinol. Typical C5-C10 monohydric alcohols<br>
are hexanol, 2-ethyl-1-butanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 1-heptanol, 2-<br>
heptanol, 4-heptanol, 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol, 1-octanol, 2-octanol, 2-<br>

The monohydric alcohols may be unsaturated, as long as they do not act<br>
as catalyst poisons.<br>
Preferable monohydric alcohols are those of formula ROH in which R is a<br>
C2-C16 alkyl group, most preferably a C4-C12 alkyl group, particularly 2-<br>
ethyl-1-hexanol or 1-octanol.<br>
Preferably, essentially all of the aromatic carboxylic acid ester is a<br>
reaction product of a carboxylic acid halide, preferably a dicarboxylic acid<br>
dihalide, more preferably an unsaturated dicarboxylic acid dihalide, most<br>
preferably phthalic acid dichloride, with the monohydric alcohol.<br>
The compound of a fourvalent group 4 metal containing a halogen is<br>
preferably a titanium tetrahalide. Equivalent to titanium tetrahalide is the<br>
combination of an alkoxy titanium halide and a halogenation agent, which<br>
are able to form a titanium tetrahalide in situ. The most preferred halide is<br>
the chloride.<br>
 <br>
As is known, the addition of the at least one halogenated hydrocarbon<br>
during the catalyst preparation process can lead to further improved<br>
catalytic activity. Reactive halogenated hydrocarbons preferably have the<br>
formula R"'X"'n, wherein R"' is a C1-C20 hydrocarbyl group, particularly a<br>
C1-C10 aliphatic hydrocarbyl group, X"' is a halogen, preferably chlorine,<br>
and n is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
Such chlorinated hydrocarbons include monochloromethane,<br>

hydrocarbons may also be unsaturated, provided that the unsaturation<br>
does not act as catalyst poison in the final catalyst.<br>
In the above formula, R"' is preferably a C1-C10 alkyl group, X"' is<br>
preferably chlorine and n is preferably 1 or 2. Preferred compounds<br>
include butyl chloride (BuCI), dichloroalkanes such as (1,4)-<br>
dichlorobutane, and tertiary butyl chloride.<br>
The catalyst preparation as described herein can be carried out<br>
batchwise, semi-continuously or continuously. In such a semi-continuous<br>
or continuous process, the solution of the complex of the group 2 metal<br>
and said electron donor, which is prepared by reacting the compound of<br>
said metal with said electron donor in an organic liquid reaction medium,<br>
is mixed with at least one compound of a transition metal which might be<br>
solved in the same or different organic liquid reaction medium. The so<br>
obtained solution is then agitated, possibly in the presence of an<br>
 <br>
emulsion stabilizer, and then the agitated emulsion is fed into a<br>
temperature gradient reactor, in which the emulsion is subjected to a<br>
temperature gradient, thus leading to solidifying the droplets of a<br>
dispersed phase of the emulsion. The TMA is preferably contained in the<br>
solution of the complex or added to the solution before feeding the<br>
agitated solution to the temperature gradient reactor.<br>
When feeding said agitated emulsion to the temperature gradient reactor,<br>
an inert solvent, in which the droplets are not soluble, can additionally be<br>
fed into that gradient reactor in order to improve that droplet formation<br>
and thus leading to a uniform grain size of the particles of the catalyst,<br>
which are formed in the temperature gradient reactor when passing<br>
through said line. Such additional solvent might be the same as the<br>
organic liquid reaction medium, which is used for preparing the solution<br>
of the complex of the group 2 metal as explained above in more detail.<br>
The solidified particles of the catalyst can subsequently be recovered by<br>
an in-stream filtering unit and are preferably subjected to washing in<br>
order to remove unreacted starting components.<br>
The recovered particulate product is washed at least once, preferably at<br>
least twice, most preferably at least three times with a hydrocarbon,<br>
which is preferably selected from aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
preferably with toluene, particularly with hot (e.g. 90 oC) toluene, which<br>
may include a small amount, preferably about 0.01 - 10 vol% of TiCI4 or<br>
an alkyl aluminium chloride, such as diethyl aluminium chloride (DEAC),<br>
in it. A further washing step is advantageous performed with heptane,<br>
most preferably with hot (e.g. 90 °C) heptane, and a still further washing<br>
step with pentane. A washing step typically includes several substeps. A<br>
favored washing sequence is, for example, one washing step with toluene<br>
at 90 °C, two washing steps with heptane at 90 °C and one or two<br>
washing steps with pentane at room temperature.<br>
 <br>
Finally, the washed catalyst is dried, e.g. by evaporation or flushing with<br>
nitrogen.<br>
After washing and drying the catalyst can be stored for further use or can<br>
be subjected to further treatment steps or can immediately be fed to a<br>
polymerization reactor.<br>
The catalyst system which is used according to the present invention also<br>
comprises an aluminium alkyl compound, preferably of the general<br>
formula AIR3-nXn wherein R stands for straight chain or branched alkyl<br>
group having 1 to 20, preferably 1 to 10 and more preferably 1 to 6<br>
carbon atoms, X stands for halogen and n stands for 0, 1, 2 or 3, which<br>
aluminium alkyl compound is added, and brought into contact with the<br>
droplets of the dispersed phase of the agitated emulsion before<br>
recovering the solidified particles of the catalyst.<br>
It is further preferred that at least a part of the aluminium compound is<br>
added, in pure form or in the form of a solution, from shortly before the<br>
beginning of the emulsion formation until adding it to the washing liquid,<br>
e.g. toluene, in such an amount that the final Al content of the particles is<br>
from 0.05 to 1 wt%, preferably 0.1 to 0.8 wt% and most preferably 0.2 to<br>
0.7 wt%. by weight of the final catalyst particles. The most preferred Al<br>
content may vary depending upon the type of the Al compound and on<br>
the adding step. For example, in some cases the most preferred amount<br>
may be 0.1 to 0.4 wt%.<br>
Still further, preferably tri-(C1-C6)-alkyl aluminium compounds are used,<br>
triethylaluminium being most preferred.<br>
In Ziegler-Natta catalysts alumimium alkyl compounds are used as<br>
cocatalysts, i.e. for activating the catalyst. During activation of<br>
polypropylene catalysts, alkyl aluminium does not only reduce and<br>
alkylate the active metal, but it has also influence on the donor<br>
 <br>
composition. It is well-known that alkyl aluminium compounds can<br>
remove carboxylic acid esters, which are used as internal donors.<br>
Simultaneously, external donors can be fixed on the catalyst. Typically,<br>
tri-ethyl aluminium (TEAI) is used as cocatalyst and silanes as external<br>
donors as is disclosed e.g. in articles Sacci, M. C; Forlini, F.; Tritto, I and<br>
Locatelli, P., Macromolecules, 1996, 29, 3341-3345 and Sacci, M. C;<br>
Tritto, I.; Shan, C. and Mendichi, R., Macromolecules, 1991, 24, 6823-<br>
6826.<br>
In the catalysts used in the present invention, the internal donor,<br>
preferably bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DOP), can be significantly<br>
extracted from the catalyst with the use of the alkyl aluminium compound.<br>
The extraction level is dependent on the concentration of the aluminium<br>
alkyl. The higher the concentration, the more of the internal donor can be<br>
extracted. Further, the addition of the external donor together with<br>
aluminium alkyl improves the donor exchange. The longer the reaction<br>
time is, the more external donor is bound on the catalyst.<br>
Particularly preferred external donors are any of the following: cyclohexyl<br>
methyl dimethyloxysilane, dicyclopentyl dimethoxysilane, diisopropyl<br>
dimethoxysilane, di-isobutyl dimethoxysilane and di-tert.-butyl<br>
dimethoxysilane. Most preferred are cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxysilane<br>
and dicyclopentyl dimethoxysilane, cyclohexyl methyl dimethoxysilane<br>
being particularly preferred.<br>
It is preferred that a solution containing alkyl aluminium and external<br>
donor in an organic solvent, e.g. pentane, are added to the catalyst after<br>
solidification of the catalyst particles.<br>
The catalyst which is obtained by the above described process is a non-<br>
supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst. Non-supported catalysts do not use any<br>
 <br>
external carrier, contrary to conventional catalysts, e.g. conventional<br>
Ziegler-Natta catalysts, which are e.g. supported on silica or MgCI2.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the catalyst system production include<br>
all preferred embodiments as described in WO 03/000754.<br>
The present invention further relates to the use of the polypropylene<br>
composition of the invention for the production of a film and/or injection<br>
molded articles.<br>
Moreover, the present invention relates to a process for preparing a film,<br>
wherein the inventive polypropylene composition is formed into a film and<br>
wherein the polypropylene composition is not subjected to a vis-breaking<br>
step. The films may be prepared by any process known to the skilled<br>
person, but are preferably produced by a cast film process or a blown<br>
film process. A roll stack process may also be used.<br>
The films comprising the inventive polypropylene composition may be<br>
produced with varying thickness, preferably between 20 and 400<br>
micrometers more preferably between 30 and 300 micrometers.<br>
The present invention is further characterized by the following examples.<br>
 <br>
Examples<br>
1. Definitions:<br>
a)	Melt Flow Rate<br>
The melt flow rate (MFR) is determined according to ISO 1133 and is<br>
indicated in g/10 min. The MFR is an indication of the flowability, and<br>
hence the processability, of the polymer. The higher the melt flow rate,<br>
the lower the viscosity of the polymer. The MFR2 of polypropylene is<br>
determined at a temperature of 230 °C and a load of 2.16 kg, the MFR5 of<br>
polyethylene is measured at a temperature 190 °C and a load of 5 kg and<br>
the MFR2 of polyethylene at a temperature 190 °C and a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
b)	Weight Average Molecular Weight and MWD<br>
The weight average molecular weight Mw and the molecular weight<br>
distribution (MWD = Mw/Mn wherein Mn is the number average molecular<br>
weight and Mw is the weight average molecular weight) is measured by a<br>
method based on ISO 16014-1:2003 and ISO 16014-4:2003. A Waters<br>
Alliance GPCV 2000 instrument, equipped with refractive index detector<br>
and online viscosimeter was used with 3 x TSK-gel columns (GMHXL-HT)<br>
from TosoHaas and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB, stabilized with 200 mg/L<br>
2,6-Di tert butyl-4-methyl-phenol) as solvent at 145 °C and at a constant<br>
flow rate of 1 ml/min. 216.5 µl of sample solution were injected per<br>
analysis. The column set was calibrated using relative calibration with 19<br>
narrow MWD polystyrene (PS) standards in the range of 0.5 kg/mol to 11<br>
500 kg/mol and a set of well characterized broad polypropylene<br>
standards. All samples were prepared by dissolving 5-10 mg of polymer<br>
in 10 ml (at 160 °C) of stabilized TCB (same as mobile phase) and<br>
keeping for 3 hours with continuous shaking prior sampling in into the<br>
GPC instrument.<br>
 <br>
In case of PP the constants are: K: 19 x10-3 ml/g and a: 0.725<br>
c) Xylene Soluble Fraction<br>
The xylene soluble fraction (XCS) as defined and described in the present<br>
invention is determined as follows: 2.0 g of the polymer were dissolved in<br>
250 ml p-xylene at 135 CC under agitation. After 30 minutes, the solution<br>
was allowed to cool for 15 minutes at ambient temperature and then<br>
allowed to settle for 30 minutes at 25 ± 0.5 °C. The solution was filtered<br>
with filter paper into two 100 ml flasks. The solution from the first 100 ml<br>
vessel was evaporated in nitrogen flow and the residue dried under<br>
vacuum at 90 °C until constant weight is reached. The xylene soluble<br>
fraction (percent) can then be determined as follows:<br>
XCS% = (100xm1 X v0)/(m0 x v1),<br>
wherein m0 designates the initial polymer amount (grams), m1 defines the<br>
weight of residue (grams), vo defines the initial volume (milliliter) and v1<br>
defines the volume of the analysed sample (milliliter). The fraction<br>
insoluble in p-xylene at 25°C (XCU) is then equal to 100% - XCS%.<br>
d)	Comonomer content<br>
Comonomer content is measured with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy<br>
(FTIR) calibrated with 13C-NMR. When measuring the ethylene content in<br>
polypropylene, a thin film of the sample (thickness about 250 mm) was<br>
prepared by hot-pressing. The area of -CH2- absorption peak (800-650 cm-1)<br>
was measured with Perkin Elmer FTIR 1600 spectrometer. The method was<br>
calibrated by ethylene content data measured by 13C-NMR.<br>
e)	Emission of volatiles<br>
The content of volatiles is determined according to VDA 277:1995 using a<br>
gas chromatography (GC) device with a WCOT-capillary column (wax<br>
 <br>
type with 0.25 µ film thickness) of 0.25 mm inner diameter and 30 m<br>
length. The GC settings were as follows: 3 minutes isothermal at 50 °C,<br>
heat up to 200 °C at 12 K/min, 4 minutes isothermal at 200 °C, injection-<br>
temperature: 200°C, detection-temperature: 250 °C, carrier helium, flow-<br>
mode split 1:20 and average carrier-speed 22 - 27 cm/s.<br>
f) Sealing<br>
1.	General<br>
The method determines the sealing temperature range of polypropylene films.<br>
The sealing temperature range is the temperature range, in which the films can<br>
be sealed according to conditions given below.<br>
The lower limit (heat sealing initiation temperature (SIT)) is the sealing<br>
temperature at which a sealing strength of &gt; 5 N is achieved. The upper limit<br>
(sealing end temperature (SET)) is reached, when the films stick to the sealing<br>
device.<br>
2.	Sample geometry and sample preparation<br>
The samples were extruded with OCS at 220 °C and taken in longitudinal<br>
direction of extrusion. The sample size was 45 mm x 170 mm, the film<br>
thickness was 50 micrometers for propylene homopolymers and 50<br>
micrometers and 130 micrometers for propylene random copolymers.<br>
3.	Sealing Device<br>
For sealing the laboratory sealing device KOPP SGPE-20 was used. Prior to the<br>
test, the device was checked for the parallel position of the sealing jaws.<br>
4.	Sealing parameters<br>
The sealing parameters were set to:<br>
 <br>
Sealing force: 600 N<br>
Sealing time: 1 s<br>
Sealing jaws: 100 x 20 mm, smooth<br>
Heating: both jaws, precision +/-1 °C<br>
Start temperature: 100 °C<br>
5.	Sealing procedure<br>
-	Stripes were folded to 85 x 45 mm and put between the sealing jaws.<br>
-	The jaws were heated to sealing temperature<br>
-	Immediately after sealing, the sample was taken out of the device<br>
-	For each temperature, 10 samples were sealed<br>
6.	Testing<br>
To determine the initial strength, samples were sealed at one temperature<br>
setting and with KOPP SGPE-20-IMPULS tested for the sealing strength.<br>
If the mean value of 10 tests - as described above - was &gt; 5 N, then the heat<br>
sealing initiation temperature (SIT) was reached. If not, the sealing temperature<br>
was increased by 2 °C and the test was repeated.<br>
After having reached the heat sealing initiation temperature (SIT), the sealing<br>
temperature was further increased in steps of 2 °C until the film sticks to the<br>
sealing jaws.<br>
After taking the sealed film from the device, 5 minutes were waited before the<br>
film was stretched with a take-off speed of 2.5 m/min to measure the sealing<br>
strength in Newton. The heat sealing initiation temperature (SIT) is the<br>
temperature where a sealing strength of &gt; 5 N was reached.<br>
 <br>
The sealing end temperature (SET) is the temperature where the film sticked to<br>
the sealing jaws.<br>
The precision of the method was determined by the temperature steps, i.e. 2<br>
°C.<br>
g) Transparency, haze, clarity, gloss<br>
Transparency, haze and clarity were determined on cast films with a<br>
thickness of 30 µm, 50 µm, 80 µm and 130 µm for propylene random<br>
copolymers and with a thickness of 30 µm, 50 /L/m, 80 /L/m and 300 µm for<br>
propylene homopolymers according to ASTM D 1003/92.<br>
Gloss was determined on cast films with a thickness of 30 µm, 50 µm, 80<br>
µm and 130 µm for propylene random copolymers and with a thickness of<br>
30 /L/m, 50 /L/m, 80 µm and 300 µm for propylene homopolymers according<br>
to DIN 67530 at an angle of 20°.<br>
The retortability performance in terms of transparency, haze and clarity<br>
was determined according to ASTM D 1003 by measuring those optical<br>
parameters after steam sterilization at 121 °C for 30 min on cast films with<br>
a thickness of 50 /L/m and 130 µm for propylene random copolymers and<br>
with a thickness of 50 /L/m for propylene homopolymers.<br>
The blooming (pasteurization) performance in terms of transparency,<br>
haze, clarity, gloss inside (of roll) and gloss outside (of roll) was<br>
determined according to an internal standard in line with pasteurization<br>
conditions by measuring those optical parameters after incubation at 70<br>
°C for 72 h on cast films with a thickness of 80 /L/m for both propylene<br>
random copolymers and propylene homopolymers.<br>
 <br>
h) Coefficient of Friction (CoF)<br>
The dynamic Coefficient of Friction (CoF) as a measure of the frictional<br>
behaviour of the film was determined according to DIN 53 375 on film<br>
samples with a thickness of 30 µm for both propylene random<br>
copolymers and homopolymers. Immediately after film production the film<br>
has been stored at room temperature (23 °C for 144 min, 1 day, 3 days, 7<br>
days and 21 days. Measurement of CoF was then performed at 23 °C on<br>
the inside of the film roll (inside/inside - friction).<br>
i) Tensile modulus Film TD (transversal direction), Tensile Modulus Rim<br>
MD (machine direction), Elongation at break TD and Elongation at break MD:<br>
Tensile moduli in machine and transverse direction were determined according<br>
to ISO 527-3 on 50 µm films at a cross head speed of 1 mm/min. Subsequently<br>
elongation at break in machine and transverse direction were determined<br>
according to ISO-527-3 on the same specimens using a cross head speed of<br>
50 mm/min. Test speed was changed after a deformation of 0.25%.<br>
j) Impact strength of films (Dynatest) at +23°C<br>
The impact strength of films is determined according to ISO 7725-2 on<br>
monolayer cast films with a thickness of 50 µm. The value "Wbreak" [J/mm]<br>
represents the total energy per mm thickness that a film can absorb<br>
before it breaks. The higher this value, the tougher the material is.<br>
 <br>
2. Materials<br>
a) Preparation of the catalyst for inventive examples 1 and 2<br>
Preparation of the Mg-complex<br>
In a 150 I steel reactor 19.3 kg of 2-ethyl hexane-1-ol were added at 20<br>
°C. 56.0 kg of a 20 % BOMAG A (Tradename) [Mg(Bu)1.5(Oct)0.5] solution<br>
in toluene were then slowly added to the well stirred alcohol. The<br>
temperature of the mixture was then increased to 60 °C, and the reactants<br>
were allowed to react for 30 min at this temperature. After addition of 5.5<br>
kg of 1,2-phthaloyl dichloride, the reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for<br>
another 30 min to ensure complete reaction. 13.8 kg of 1-chloro butane<br>
were then added at 60 °C, and stirring at this temperature was continued<br>
for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature a yellow solution was<br>
obtained.<br>
Preparation of the catalyst<br>
100 ml titanium chloride were placed in a 1 I reactor equipped with a<br>
mechanical stirrer. Mixing speed was adjusted to 110 rpm. After addition<br>
of 50 ml n-heptane, 180 ml of the Mg-complex solution was added to the<br>
well-stirred reaction mixture at 25 °C within 10 min. After addition a dark<br>
red emulsion was formed. After addition of the Mg-complex, 15 ml of<br>
toluene solution containing 45 mg polydecene was added. Then 10 ml of<br>
Viscoplex® 1-254 was added. 10 min after addition the temperature of the<br>
reactor was increased to 90 °C and stirring at this temperature was<br>
continued for 30 min. After settling and filtering, the solid was washed<br>
with 200 ml of toluene containing 0.1 vol% diethyl aluminium chloride at<br>
90 °C for 35 min. Then the washings were continued with two times 150<br>
ml heptane for 10 min. Then the catalyst was taken out from the reactor to<br>
a separate drying vessel as a slurry with 100 ml of heptane. Finally, the<br>
 <br>
solid catalyst was dried at 60 °C by purging nitrogen through the catalyst<br>
bed.<br>
b)	Polymerisation of inventive propylene homopolymer 1 (Ex 1)<br>
The PP homo- and copolymers were produced in a pilot plant having a<br>
loop reactor to which the catalyst, cocatalyst and donor were fed in a<br>
premixed form. The ratio between the monomer feed and the TEAI-feed<br>
was set at 0.20 g/kg, cyclohexyl-methyl-dimethoxysilane ("donor C",<br>
supplied by Wacker, Germany) at a ratio TEAI/donor of 15 g/g was used.<br>
At a temperature of 71 °C and a pressure of 34.5 bars polymerization was<br>
carried out in liquid phase at a production rate of 65.2 kg/h, adjusting the<br>
hydrogen feed such as to achieve a product MFR of 6.8 g/10min. A<br>
catalyst productivity of 18.9 kg/g was achieved, and the resulting polymer<br>
had a xylene solubles content of 2.0 wt%.<br>
c)	Polymerisation of inventive propylene random copolymer 2 (Ex 2)<br>
The same polymerization setup and conditions as for Ex 1 were used,<br>
changing the ratio TEAI/donor to 4 g/g and the temperature to 70°C.<br>
Ethylene was fed as comonomer together with the liquid propylene in a<br>
suitable concentration as to achieve a final ethylene content of 3.5 wt%,<br>
resulting in a production rate of 67.1 kg/h. The hydrogen feed was<br>
adjusted as to achieve a product MFR of 6.0 g/10min. A catalyst<br>
productivity of 47.4 kg/g was achieved, and the resulting polymer had a<br>
xylene solubles content of 4.4 wt%.<br>
d)	Polymerisation of comparative propylene homopolymer 1 (CE 1)<br>
The same polymerization setup and conditions as for Ex 1 were used, this<br>
time with Avant MC-L1 (supplied by Lyondell-Basell, Italy) as catalyst and<br>
a ratio TEAI/donor of 15 g/g. At a production rate of 63.5 kg/h the<br>
hydrogen feed was adjusted as to achieve a product MFR of 2.8 g/10min.<br>
 <br>
A catalyst productivity of 32.4 kg/g was achieved, and the resulting<br>
polymer had a xylene solubles content of 3.8 wt%. In the compounding<br>
step outlined below the polymer was visbroken by addition of 1.2 wt% of<br>
a masterbatch containing a propylene homopolymer and 5 wt% 2,5-bis<br>
(tert.butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane (Trigonox® 101, distributed by Akzo<br>
Nobel, Netherlands) to achieve a final MFR of 7.1 g/10min.<br>
e)	Polymerisation of comparative propylene random copolymer 2 (CE<br>
2)<br>
The same polymerization setup and conditions as for Ex 1 were used,<br>
changing the ratio TEAI/donor to 4 g/g and the temperature to 70°C.<br>
Ethylene was fed as comonomer together with the liquid propylene in a<br>
suitable concentration as to achieve a final ethylene content of 3.9 wt%,<br>
resulting in a production rate of 63.9 kg/h. The hydrogen feed was<br>
adjusted as to achieve a product MFR of 1.4 g/10min. A catalyst<br>
productivity of 52.1 kg/g was achieved, and the resulting polymer had a<br>
xylene solubles content of 6.8 wt%. In the compounding step outlined<br>
below the polymer was visbroken by addition of 2.0 wt% of a masterbatch<br>
containing a propylene homopolymer and 5 wt% 2,5-bis<br>
(tert.butylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane (Trigonox® 101, distributed by Akzo<br>
Nobel, Netherlands) to achieve a final MFR of 7.5 g/10min.<br>
f)	Compounding of reactor polymer powders<br>
The powders of inventive examples 1 and 2 as well as comparative<br>
examples 1 and 2 were compounded with 0.1 wt% of Irganox B215<br>
(antioxidant masterbatch supplied by Ciba Specialty Chemicals,<br>
Switzerland), 0.2 wt% erucic acid amide, and 0.18 wt% synthetic silica<br>
(Gasil® AB725 for Ex1, Ex2 and CE1; Sylobloc® 45 for CE2) on a twin-<br>
screw extruder at 200-250°C.<br>
 <br>
were subjected to a vis-breaking step with peroxide as indicated above.<br>
The inventive polypropylene compositions of Examples 1 and 2 were not<br>
subjected to a vis-breaking step.<br>
g) Preparation of cast films<br>
Cast films were produced on a single screw extruder with a barrel<br>
diameter of 30 mm and a slot die of 200 x 0.5 mm in combination with a<br>
chill- and take-up roll. Melt temperature was 260 °C in the die. The chill<br>
roll and the take-up roll were kept at 15 °C. Film thickness of 30 µm, 50<br>
µm, 80 µm, 130 µm and 300 µm were adjusted by varying the ratio<br>
between the extruder output and the take-off speed.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1 for the films made of propylene<br>
homopolymers (Example 1 and Comparative Example 1) and in Table 2<br>
for the films made of propylene random copolymers (Example 2 and<br>
Comparative Example 2)<br>
