				<td>process for the producation of inverse opal-like structures.<br>
The invention relates to the use of core/shell particles as template for the<br>
production of inverse opal.like structures, and to a process for the produc-<br>
tion of inverse opal-like structures.<br>
The term three-dimensional photonic structures is generally taken to mean<br>
systems which have a regular, three-dimensional modulation of the di-<br>
electric constants (and thus also of the refractive index). If the periodic<br>
modulation length corresponds approximately to the wavelength of (visi-<br>
ble) light, the structure interacts with the light in the manner of a three-<br>
dimensional diffraction grating, which is evident from angle-dependent<br>
colour phenomena. An example of this is the naturally occurring precious<br>
stone opal, which consists of silicon dioxide spheres in spherical closest<br>
packing with air- or water-filled cavities in between. The inverse structure<br>
thereto is notionally formed by regular spherical cavities being arranged in<br>
closest packing in a solid material. An advantage of inverse structures of<br>
this type over the normal structures is the formation of photonic band gaps<br>
with much lower dielectric constant contrasts still (K. Busch et al. Phys.<br>
Rev. Letters E, 198, 50, 3896). TiO2 in particular is a suitable material for<br>
the formation of a photonic structure since it has a high refractive index.<br>
Three-dimensional inverse structures can be produced by template syn-<br>
thesis:<br>
• Monodisperse spheres are arranged in spherical closest packing as<br>
structure-forming templates.<br>
• The cavities between the spheres are filled with a gaseous or liquid pre-<br>
cursor or a solution of a precursor utilising capillary effects.<br>
• The precursor is converted (thermally) into the desired material.<br>
• The templates are removed, leaving behind the inverse structure.<br>
Many such processes are disclosed in the literature. For example, SiO2<br>
spheres can be arranged in closest packing and the cavities filled with<br>
tetraethyl orthotitanate-containing solutions. After a number of conditioning<br>
steps, the spheres are removed using HF in an etching process, leaving<br>
behind the inverse structure of titanium dioxide (V. Colvin et al. Adv.<br>
Mater. 2001, 13, 180).<br>
De La Rue et al. (De La Rue et al. Synth. Metals, 2001, 116, 469) describe<br>
the production of inverse opals consisting of TiO2 by the following method:<br>
a dispersion of 400 nm polystyrene spheres is dried on a filter paper under<br>
an IR lamp. The filter cake is washed by sucking through ethanol, trans-<br>
ferred into a glove box and infiltrated with tetraethyl orthotitanate by<br>
means of a water-jet pump. The filter paper is carefully removed from the<br>
latex/ethoxide composite, and the composite is transferred into a tubular<br>
furnace. Calcination in a stream of air is carried out in the tubular furnace<br>
at 575°C for 8 h, causing the formation of titanium dioxide from the ethox-<br>
ide and burning out the latex particles. An inverse opal structure of TiO2<br>
remains behind.<br>
Martinelli et al. (M. Martinelli et al. Optical Mater. 2001, 17, 11) describe<br>
the production of inverse TiO2 opals using 780 nm and 3190 nm polysty-<br>
rene spheres. A regular arrangement in spherical closest packing is<br>
achieved by centrifuging the aqueous sphere dispersion at 700 - 1000<br>
rpm for 24 - 48 hours followed by decantation and drying in air. The regu-<br>
larly arranged spheres are moistened with ethanol on a filter in a Buchner<br>
funnel and then provided dropwise with an ethanolic solution of tetraethyl<br>
orthotitanate. After the titanate solution has percolated in, the sample is<br>
dried in a vacuum desiccator for 4 — 12 hours. This filling procedure is<br>
repeated 4 to 5 times. The polystyrene spheres are subsequently burnt out<br>
at 600°C - 800°C for 8 - 10 hours.<br>
Stein et al. (A. Stein et al. Science, 1998, 281, 538) describe the synthesis<br>
of inverse TiO2 opals starting from polystyrene spheres having a diameter<br>
of 470 nm as template. These are produced in a 28-hour process, sub-<br>
jected to centrifugation and air-dried. The latex templates are then applied<br>
to a filter paper. Ethanol is sucked into the latex template via a Buchner<br>
funnel connected to a vacuum pump. Tetraethyl orthotitanate is then<br>
added dropwise with suction. After drying in a vacuum desiccator for 24 h,<br>
the latices are burnt out at 575°C for 12 h in a stream of air.<br>
Vos et al. (W. L. Vos et al. Science, 1998, 281, 802) produce inverse TiO2<br>
opals using polystyrene spheres having diameters of 180 - 1460 nm as<br>
template. In order to establish spherical closest packing of the spheres, a<br>
sedimentation technique is used supported by centrifugation over a period<br>
of up to 48 h. After slow evacuation in order to dry the template structure,<br>
an ethanolic solution of tetra-n-propoxy orthotitanate is added to the latter<br>
in a glove box. After about 1 h, the infiltrated material is brought into the<br>
air in order to allow the precursor to react to give TiO2. This procedure is<br>
repeated eight times in order to ensure complete filling with TiO2. The<br>
material is then calcined at 450°C.<br>
The production of photonic structures from inverse opals is very compjex<br>
and time-consuming by the processes described in the literature:<br>
• lengthy/complex production of the template or the arrangement of the<br>
spheres forming the template-forming structure in spherical closest<br>
packing<br>
• filling of the cavities of the template structure with precursors, which is<br>
lengthy/complex since it frequently has to be carried out a number of<br>
times<br>
• lengthy/complex procedure for removal of the templates<br>
• only limited or no possibility of the production of relatively large<br>
photonic structures having an inverse opal structure and scale-up of<br>
the laboratory synthesis into industrial production.<br>
The disadvantages make the production of the desired photonic materials<br>
having an inverse opal structure more difficult. There is consequently a<br>
demand for a production process which is simple to implement and can<br>
also be scaled up to an industrial scale.<br>
Core/shell particles whose shell forms a matrix and whose core is essen-<br>
tially solid and has an essentially monodisperse size distribution are<br>
described in the earlier German patent application DE 10145450.3<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that core/shell particles of this type are<br>
eminently suitable as template for the production of inverse opal struc-<br>
tures.<br>
The present invention therefore relates firstly to the use of the core/shell<br>
particles whose shell forms a matrix and whose core is essentially solid<br>
and has an essentially monodisperse size distribution as template for the<br>
production of inverse opal structures.<br>
The present invention furthermore relates to a process for the production<br>
of inverse opal structures, characterised in that<br>
a) a dispersion of core/shell particles whose shell forms a matrix<br>
and whose core is essentially solid is dried,<br>
b) optionally one or more precursors of suitable wall materials are<br>
added, and<br>
c) the cores are subsequently removed.<br>
The use according to the invention of core/shell particles results, in par-<br>
ticular, in the following advantages<br>
- on drying of dispersions of core/shell particles, cracking in the<br>
template (= arrangement of the spheres)) during drying can be<br>
reduced or even prevented entirely,<br>
- large-area regions of high order can be obtained in the template,<br>
- stresses which arise during the drying process can be compen-<br>
sated for by the elastic nature of the shell,<br>
- if polymers form the shell, these can intertwine with one another<br>
and thus mechanically stabilise the regular sphere arrangement in<br>
the template,<br>
- if the shell is strongly bonded to the core - preferably by grafting -<br>
via an interlayer, the templates can be processed via melt proc-<br>
esses.<br>
It is therefore particularly preferred in accordance with the invention for the<br>
shell in the core/shell particles to be bonded to the core via an interlayer.<br>
In order to achieve the optical or photonic effect according to the inven-<br>
tion, it is desirable for the core/shell particles to have a mean particle<br>
diameter in the range from about 5 nm to about 2000 nm. It may be par-<br>
ticularly preferred here for the core/shell particles to have a mean particle<br>
diameter in the range from about 5 to 20 nm, preferably 5 to 10 nm. In this<br>
case, the cores may be known as "quantum dots"; they exhibit the corre-<br>
sponding effects known from the literature. In order to achieve colour<br>
effects in the region of visible light, it is particularly advantageous for the<br>
core/shell particles to have a mean particle diameter in the range from<br>
about 50 - 500 nm. Particular preference is given to the use of particles in<br>
the range 100 - 500 nm, since in particles in this size range (depending<br>
on the refractive-index contrast which can be achieved in the photonic<br>
structure), the reflections of various wavelengths of visible light differ sig-<br>
nificantly from one another, and thus the opaiescence which is particularly<br>
important for optical effects in the visible region occurs to a particularly<br>
pronounced extent in a very wide variety of colours. However, it is also<br>
preferred in a variant of the present invention to employ multiples of this<br>
preferred particle size, which then result in reflections corresponding to the<br>
higher orders and thus in a broad colour play.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the interlayer is a layer of<br>
crosslinked or at least partially crosslinked polymers. The crosslinking of<br>
the interlayer here can take place via free radicals, for example induced by<br>
UV irradiation, or preferably via di- or oligofunctional monomers. Preferred<br>
interlayers in this embodiment comprise 0.01 to 100% by weight, particu-<br>
larly preferably 0.25 to 10% by weight, of di- or oligofunctional monomers.<br>
Preferred di- or oligofunctional monomers are, in particular, isoprene and<br>
allyl methacrylate (ALMA). Such an interlayer of crosslinked or at least<br>
partially crosslinked polymers preferably has a thickness in the range from<br>
10 to 20 nm. If the interlayer comes out thicker, the refractive index of the<br>
layer is selected so that it corresponds either to the refractive index of the<br>
core or to the refractive index of the shell.<br>
If copolymers which, as described above, contain a crosslinkable mono-<br>
mer are employed as interlayer, the person skilled in the art will have<br>
absolutely no problems in suitably selecting corresponding copolymeris-<br>
able monomers. For example, corresponding copolymerisable monomers<br>
can be selected from a so-called Q-e-scheme (cf. textbooks on macro-<br>
molecular chemistry). Thus, monomers such as methyl methacrylate and<br>
methyl acrylate can preferably be polymerised with ALMA.<br>
In another, likewise preferred embodiment of the present invention, shell<br>
polymers are grafted directly onto the core via a corresponding function-<br>
alisation of the core. The surface functionalisation of the core here forms<br>
the interlayer according to the invention. The type of surface functionalisa-<br>
tion here depends principally on the material of the core. Silicon dioxide<br>
surfaces can, for example, be suitably modified with silanes carrying cor-<br>
respondingly reactive end groups, such as epoxy functions or free double<br>
bonds. In the case of polymeric cores, the surface modification can be car-<br>
ried out, for example, using a styrene which is functionalised on the aro-<br>
matic ring, such as bromostyrene. This functionalisation then allows<br>
growing-on of the shell polymers to be achieved. In particular, the inter-<br>
layer can also effect adhesion of the shell to the core via ionic interactions<br>
or complex bonds.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the shell of these core/shell particles consists<br>
of essentially uncrosslinked organic polymers, which are preferably grafted<br>
onto the core via an at least partially crosslinked interlayer.<br>
The shell here can consist either of thermoplastic or elastomeric polymers.<br>
The core can consist of a very wide variety of materials. The only essential<br>
factor for the purposes of the present invention is that the core and, in a<br>
variant of the invention, preferably also the interlayer and shell can be<br>
removed under conditions under which the wall material is stable. The<br>
choice of suitable core/shell/interlayer-wall material combinations presents<br>
the person skilled in the art with absolutely no difficulties.<br>
It is furthermore particularly preferred in a variant of the invention for the<br>
core to consist of an organic polymer, which is preferably crosslinked.<br>
In another variant of the invention which is explained in greater detail<br>
below, the cores consist of an inorganic material, preferably a metal or<br>
semimetal or a metal chalcogenide or metal pnictide. For the purposes of<br>
the present invention, chalcogenides are taken to mean compounds in<br>
which an element from group 16 of the Periodic Table of the Elements is<br>
the electronegative bonding partner; pnictides are taken to mean those in<br>
which an element from group 15 of the Periodic Table of the Elements is<br>
the electronegative bonding partner. Preferred cores consist of metal chal-<br>
cogenides, preferably metal oxides, or metal pnictides, preferably nitrides<br>
or phosphides. Metal in the sense of these terms are all elements which<br>
can occur as electropositive partner compared with the counterions, such<br>
as the classical metals of the sub-groups, or the main-group metals from<br>
the first and second main group, but also all elements from the third main<br>
group, as well as silicon, germanium, tin, lead, phosphorus, arsenic, anti-<br>
mony and bismuth. The preferred metal chalcogenides and metal pnictides<br>
include, in particular, silicon dioxide, aluminium oxide, gallium nitride,<br>
boron nitride, aluminium nitride, silicon nitride and phosphorus nitride. The<br>
starting material employed for the production of the core/shell particles to<br>
be employed in accordance with the invention in a variant of the present<br>
invention are preferably monodisperse cores of silicon dioxide, which can<br>
be obtained, for example, by the process described in US 4,911,903. The<br>
cores here are produced by hydrolytic polycondensation of tetraaikoxy-<br>
silanes in an aqueous-ammoniacal medium, where firstly a sol of primary<br>
particles is produced, and the resultant SiO2 particles are subsequently<br>
converted into the desired particle size by continuous, controlled metered<br>
addition of tetraalkoxysilane. This process enables the production of<br>
monodisperse SiO2 cores having mean particle diameters of between 0.05<br>
and 10 mm with a standard deviation of 5%. The starting material<br>
employed can also be monodisperse cores of non-absorbent metal oxides,<br>
such as TiO2, ZrO2, ZnO2, SnO2 or AI2O3, or metal-oxide mixtures. Their<br>
production is described, for example, in EP 0 644 914. Furthermore, the<br>
process of EP 0 216 278 for the production of monodisperse SiO2 cores<br>
can readily be applied to other oxides with the same result. Tetraethoxy-<br>
silane, tetrabutoxytitanium, tetrapropoxyzirconium or mixtures thereof are<br>
added in one portion, with vigorous mixing, to a mixture of alcohol, water<br>
and ammonia, whose temperature is set precisely to 30 to 40°C using a<br>
thermostat, and the resultant mixture is stirred vigorously for a further 20<br>
seconds, giving a suspension of monodisperse cores in the nanometre<br>
region. After a post-reaction time of from 1 to 2 hours, the cores are sepa-<br>
rated off in a conventional manner, for example by centrifugation, washed<br>
and dried.<br>
The wall of the inverse opal structures obtainable in accordance with the<br>
invention is, in an embodiment of the present invention, preferably formed<br>
from an inorganic material, preferably a metal chalcogenide or metal pnic-<br>
tide. In the present description, this material is also referred to as wall<br>
material. For the purposes of the present invention, chalcogenides are<br>
taken to mean compounds in which an element from group 16 of the Peri-<br>
odic Table is the electronegative bonding partner; pnictides are taken to<br>
mean those in which an element from group 15 of the Periodic Table is the<br>
electronegative bonding partner. Preferred wall materials are metal chal-<br>
cogenides, preferably metal oxides, or metal pnictides, preferably nitrides<br>
or phosphides. Metal in the sense of these terms are all elements which<br>
can occur as electropositive partner compared with the counterions, such<br>
as the classical metals of the sub-groups, such as, in particular, titanium<br>
and zirconium, or the main-group metals from the first and second main<br>
groups, but also all elements from the third main group, as well as silicon,<br>
germanium, tin, lead, phosphorus, arsenic, antimony and bismuth. The<br>
preferred metal chalcogenides include, in particular, silicon dioxide, alu-<br>
minium oxide and particularly preferably titanium dioxide.<br>
The starting material (precursor) employed for the production of the<br>
inverse opals in accordance with this variant of the invention can in princi-<br>
ple be all conceivable precursors which are liquid, sinterable or soluble<br>
and which can be converted into stable solids by a sol-gel-analogous con-<br>
version. Sinterable precursors here are taken to mean ceramic or pre-<br>
ceramic particles, preferably nanoparticles, which can be converted into a<br>
moulding - the inverse opal - by - as usual in ceramics - sintering, if<br>
desired with elimination of readily volatile by-products. The relevant<br>
ceramic literature (for example H.P. Baldus, M. Jansen, Angew. Chem.<br>
1997, 109, 338-354) discloses precursors of this type to the person skilled<br>
in the art. Gaseous precursors, which can be infiltrated into the template<br>
structure by a CVD-analogous method known per se, can furthermore also<br>
be employed. In a preferred variant of the present invention, use is made<br>
of solutions of one or more esters of a corresponding inorganic acid with a<br>
lower alcohol, such as, for example, tetraethoxysilane, tetrabutoxytitanium,<br>
tetrapropoxyzirconium or mixtures thereof.<br>
In a second, likewise preferred variant of the invention, the wall of the<br>
inverse opal is formed from the polymers of the shell of the core/shell par-<br>
ticles, which are preferably crosslinked with one another. In this variant of<br>
the invention, the addition of precursors in step b) can be omitted or<br>
replaced by the addition of crosslinking agents. In this variant of the<br>
invention, it may be preferred for the cores to consist of an inorganic mate-<br>
rial described above.<br>
In the process according to the invention for the production of an inverse<br>
opal structure, a dispersion of the core/shell particles described above is<br>
dried in a first step. The drying here is carried out under conditions which<br>
enable the formation of a "positive" opal structure, which then serves as<br>
template in the remainder of the process. This can be carried out, for<br>
example, by careful removal of the dispersion medium, by slow sedimen-<br>
tation or by the application of a mechanical force to a pre-dried mass of<br>
core/shell particles.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the action of mechanical force<br>
can be the action of a force which takes place in the conventional proc-<br>
essing steps of polymers. In preferred variants of the present invention,<br>
the action of mechanical force takes place either:<br>
through uniaxial pressing or<br>
action of force during an injection-moulding operation or<br>
during a transfer moulding operation,<br>
during (co)extrusion or<br>
during a calendering operation or<br>
during a blowing operation.<br>
If the action of force takes place through uniaxial pressing, the mouldings<br>
according to the invention are preferably films. Films according to the<br>
invention can preferably also be produced by calendering, film blowing or<br>
flat-film extrusion. The various ways of processing polymers under the<br>
action of mechanical forces are well known to the person skilled in the art<br>
and are revealed, for example, by the standard textbook Adolf Franck,<br>
"Kunststoff-Kompendium" [Plastics Compendium]; Vogel-Verlag; 1996.<br>
The processing of core/shell particles through the action of mechanical<br>
force, as is preferred here, is furthermore described in detail in interna-<br>
tional patent application WO 2003025035.<br>
A precursor of suitable wall materials is preferably subsequently added to<br>
the template, as described above. In a preferred variant of the process<br>
according to the invention for the production of inverse opal structures, the<br>
precursor is therefore a solution of an ester of an inorganic ortho-acid with<br>
a lower alcohol, preferably tetraethoxysilane, tetrabutoxytitanium, tetra-<br>
propoxyzirconium or mixtures thereof. Suitable solvents for the precursors<br>
are, in particular, lower alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol,<br>
isopropanol or n-butanol.<br>
As has been shown, it is advantageous to allow the precursors or alterna-<br>
tively the crosslinking agent to act on the template structure of core/shell<br>
particles for some time under a protective-gas cushion before condensa-<br>
tion of the wall material in order to effect uniform penetration into the cavi-<br>
ties. For the same reason, it is advantageous for the precursors or the<br>
crosslinking agent to be added to the template structure under reduced<br>
pressure, preferably in a static vacuum of p 
The formation of the wall material from the precursors is carried out either<br>
by addition of water and/or by heating the reaction batch. In the case of<br>
alkoxide precursors, heating in air is generally sufficient for this purpose.<br>
Under certain circumstances, it may be advantageous to wash the impreg-<br>
nated template briefly with a small amount of a solvent in order to wash off<br>
precursor adsorbed onto the surface. With this step, the formation of a<br>
thick layer of wall material, which can act as diffuser, on the surface of the<br>
template can be prevented. For the same reason, it may be advantageous<br>
also to dry the impregnated structure under mild conditions before the cal-<br>
cination.<br>
The removal of the cores in step c) can be carried out by various methods.<br>
For example, the cores can be removed by dissolution or by burning out.<br>
In a preferred variant of the process according to the invention, step c)<br>
comprises calcination of the wall material, preferably at temperatures<br>
above 200°C, particularly preferably above 400°C. If, in the variant of the<br>
invention described above, a precursor is employed for the formation of<br>
the wall, it is particularly preferred for all the core/shell particles to be<br>
removed together with the cores.<br>
If the cores consist of suitable inorganic materials, these can be removed<br>
by etching. This procedure is particularly preferred if the shell polymers<br>
are intended to form the wall of the inverse opal structure. Silicon dioxide<br>
cores, for example, can preferably be removed using HF, in particular<br>
dilute HF solution. It may in turn be preferred in this procedure for<br>
crosslinking of the shell to take place before removal of the cores, as<br>
described above.<br>
If the cavities of the inverse opal structure are to be re-impregnated with<br>
liquid or gaseous materials, however, it may also be preferred for the shell<br>
to be crosslinked only to a very small extent, or not at all. The impregna-<br>
tion here can consist, for example, in inclusion of liquid crystals, as<br>
described, for example, in Ozaki et al., Adv. Mater. 2002, 14, 514 and Sato<br>
et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 10950.<br>
Those obtainable in accordance with the invention are suitable firstly for<br>
the above-described use as photonic material, preferably with the impreg-<br>
nation mentioned, but secondly also for the production of porous surfaces,<br>
membranes, separators, filters and porous supports. These materials can<br>
also be used, for example, as fluidised beds in fluidised-bed reactors.<br>
Owing to the considerations mentioned here, it is advantageous for the<br>
shell of the core/shell particles according to the invention to comprise one<br>
or more polymers and/or copolymers or polymer precursors and, if desired,<br>
auxiliaries and additives, where the composition of the shell may be<br>
selected in such a way that it is essentially dimensionally stable and tack-<br>
free in a non-swelling environment at room temperature.<br>
With the use of polymer substances as shell material and, if desired, core<br>
material, the person skilled in the art gains the freedom to determine their<br>
relevant properties, such as, for example, their composition, the particle<br>
size, the mechanical data, the glass transition temperature, the melting<br>
point and the core:shell weight ratio and thus also the applicational prop-<br>
erties of the core/shell particles, which ultimately also affect the properties<br>
of the inverse opal structure produced therefrom.<br>
Polymers and/or copolymers which may be present in the core material or<br>
of which it consists are high-molecular-weight compounds which conform<br>
to the specification given above for the core material. Both polymers and<br>
copolymers of polymerisable unsaturated monomers and polycondensates<br>
and copolycondensates of monomers containing at least two reactive<br>
groups, such as, for example, high-molecular-weight aliphatic, aliphatic/<br>
aromatic or fully aromatic polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates, poly-<br>
ureas and polyurethanes, but also amino and phenolic resins, such as, for<br>
example, melamine-formaldehyde, urea-formaldehyde and phenol-form-<br>
aldehyde condensates, are suitable.<br>
For the production of epoxy resins, which are likewise suitable as core<br>
material, epoxide prepolymers, which are obtained, for example, by reac-<br>
tion of bisphenol A or other bisphenols, resorcinol, hydroquinone, hexane-<br>
diol or other aromatic or aliphatic diols or polyols, or phenol-formaldehyde<br>
condensates, or mixtures thereof with one another, with epichlorohydrin or<br>
other di- or polyepoxides, are usually mixed with further condensation-<br>
capable compounds directly or in solution and allowed to cure.<br>
The polymers of the core material are advantageously, in a preferred vari-<br>
ant of the invention, crosslinked (co)polymers, since these usually only<br>
exhibit their glass transition at high temperatures. These crosslinked<br>
polymers may either already have been crosslinked during the polymeri-<br>
sation or polycondensation or copolymerisation or copolycondensation or<br>
they may have been post-crosslinked in a separate process step after the<br>
actual (co)polymerisation or (co)polycondensation.<br>
A detailed description of the chemical composition of suitable polymers<br>
follows below.<br>
In principle, polymers of the classes already mentioned above, if they are<br>
selected or constructed in such a way that they conform to the specifica-<br>
tion given above for the shell polymers, are suitable for the shell material<br>
and for the core material.<br>
Polymers which meet the specifications for a shell material are likewise<br>
present in the groups of polymers and copolymers of polymerisable un-<br>
saturated monomers and polycondensates and copolycondensates of<br>
monomers containing at least two reactive groups, such as, for example,<br>
high-molecular-weight aliphatic, aliphatic/aromatic or fully aromatic poly-<br>
esters and polyamides.<br>
Taking into account the above conditions for the properties of the shell<br>
polymers (= matrix polymers), selected units from all groups of organic film<br>
formers are in principle suitable for their preparation.<br>
Some further examples are intended to illustrate the broad range of poly-<br>
mers which are suitable for the production of the shells.<br>
If the shell is intended to have a comparatively low refractive index, poly-<br>
mers such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyethylene oxide, polyacry-<br>
lates, polymethacrylates, polybutadiene, polymethyl methacrylate, poly-<br>
tetrafluoroethylene, polyoxymethylene, polyesters, polyamides, polyepox-<br>
ides, polyurethane, rubber, polyacrylonitrile and polyisoprene, for<br>
example, are suitable.<br>
If the shell is intended to have a comparatively high refractive index, poly-<br>
mers having a preferably aromatic basic structure, such as polystyrene,<br>
polystyrene copolymers, such as, for example, SAN, aromatic-aliphatic<br>
polyesters and polyamides, aromatic polysulfones and polyketones, poly-<br>
vinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride and, on suitable selection of a high-<br>
refractive-index core material, also polyacrylonitrile or polyurethane, for<br>
example, are suitable for the shell.<br>
In an embodiment of core/shell particles which is particularly preferred in<br>
accordance with the invention, the core consists of crosslinked polystyrene<br>
and the shell of a polyacrylate, preferably polyethyl acrylate, polybutyl<br>
acrylate, polymethyl methacrylate and/or a copolymer thereof.<br>
With respect to the ability of the core/shell particles to be converted into<br>
inverse opal structures, it is advantageous, if the wall material results from<br>
a precursor solution, for the core:shell weight ratio to be in the range from<br>
20:1 to 1.4:1, preferably in the range from 6:1 to 2:1 and particularly pref-<br>
erably in the range 5:1 to 3.5:1. If the wall of the inverse opal structure is<br>
formed from shell polymers, it is preferred for the core:shell weight ratio to<br>
be in the range from 5:1 to 1:10, in particular in the range from 2:1 to 1:5<br>
and particularly preferably in the region below 1:1.<br>
The core/shell particles which can be used in accordance with the inven-<br>
tion can be produced by various processes.<br>
A preferred way of obtaining the particles is a process for the production of<br>
core/shell particles by a) surface treatment of monodisperse cores, and b)<br>
application of the shell of organic polymers to the treated cores. In a proc-<br>
ess variant, the monodisperse cores are obtained in a step a) by emulsion<br>
polymerisation.<br>
In a preferred process variant, a crosslinked polymeric interlayer, which<br>
preferably contains reactive centres to which the shell can be covalently<br>
bonded, is applied to the cores in step a), preferably by emulsion polym-<br>
erisation or by ATR polymerisation. ATR polymerisation here stands for<br>
atom transfer radical polymerisation, as described, for example, in K.<br>
Matyjaszewski, Practical Atom Transfer Radical Polymerisation, Polym.<br>
Mater. Sci. Eng. 2001, 84. The encapsulation of inorganic materials by<br>
means of ATRP is described, for example, in T. Werne, T. E. Patten, Atom<br>
Transfer Radical Polymerisation from Nanoparticles: A Tool for the Prepa-<br>
ration of Weil-Defined Hybrid Nanostructures and for Understanding the<br>
Chemistry of Controlled/"Living" Radical Polymerisation from Surfaces, J.<br>
Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 7497-7505 and WO 00/11043. The perform-<br>
ance both of this method and of emulsion polymerisations is familiar to the<br>
person skilled in the art of polymer preparation and is described, for<br>
example, in the above-mentioned literature references.<br>
The liquid reaction medium in which the polymerisations or copolymerisa-<br>
tions can be carried out consists of the solvents, dispersion media or dilu-<br>
ents usually employed in polymerisations, in particular in emulsion polym-<br>
erisation processes. The choice here is made in such a way that the emul-<br>
sifiers employed for homogenisation of the core particles and shell precur-<br>
sors are able to develop adequate efficacy. Suitable liquid reaction media<br>
for carrying out the process according to the invention are aqueous media,<br>
in particular water.<br>
Suitable for initiation of the polymerisation are, for example, polymerisation<br>
initiators which decompose either thermally or photochemically, form free<br>
radicals and thus initiate the polymerisation. Preferred thermally activat-<br>
able polymerisation initiators here are those which decompose at between<br>
20 and 180°C, in particular at between 20 and 80°C. Particularly preferred<br>
polymerisation initiators are peroxides, such as dibenzoyl peroxide di-tert-<br>
butyl peroxide, peresters, percarbonates, perketals, hydroperoxides, but<br>
also inorganic peroxides, such as H2O2, salts of peroxosulfuric acid and<br>
peroxodisulfuric acid, azo compounds, alkylboron compounds, and hydro-<br>
carbons which decompose homolytically. The initiators and/or photoinitia-<br>
tors, which, depending on the requirements of the polymerised material,<br>
are employed in amounts of between 0.01 and 15% by weight, based on<br>
the polymerisable components, can be used individually or, in order to<br>
utilise advantageous synergistic effects, in combination with one another.<br>
In addition, use is made of redox systems, such as, for example, salts of<br>
peroxodisulfuric acid and peroxosulfuric acid in combination with low-<br>
valency sulfur compounds, particularly ammonium peroxodisulfate in com-<br>
bination with sodium dithionite.<br>
Corresponding processes have also been described for the production of<br>
polycondensation products. Thus, it is possible for the starting materials<br>
for the production of polycondensation products to be dispersed in inert<br>
liquids and condensed, preferably with removal of low-molecular-weight<br>
reaction products, such as water or - for example on use of di(lower alkyl)<br>
dicarboxylates for the preparation of polyesters or polyamides - lower<br>
alkanols.<br>
Polyaddition products are obtained analogously by reaction by compounds<br>
which contain at least two, preferably three, reactive groups, such as, for<br>
example, epoxide, cyanate, isocyanate or isothiocyanate groups, with<br>
compounds carrying complementary reactive groups. Thus, isocyanates<br>
react, for example, with alcohols to give urethanes, with amines to give<br>
urea derivatives, while epoxides react with these complementary groups to<br>
give hydroxyethers and hydroxyamines respectively. Like the polyconden-<br>
sations, polyaddition reactions can also advantageously be carried out in<br>
an inert solvent or dispersion medium.<br>
It is also possible for aromatic, aliphatic or mixed aromaticaliphatic poly-<br>
mers, for example polyesters, polyurethanes, polyamides, polyureas, poly-<br>
epoxides or also solution polymers, to be dispersed or emulsified<br>
(secondary dispersion) in a dispersion medium, such as, for example, in<br>
water, alcohols, tetrahydrofuran, hydrocarbons, and to be post-condensed,<br>
crosslinked and cured in this fine distribution.<br>
The stable dispersions required for these polymerisation polycondensation<br>
or polyaddition processes are generally prepared using dispersion auxilia-<br>
ries.<br>
The dispersion auxiliaries used are preferably water-soluble, high-mole-<br>
cular-weight organic compounds containing polar groups, such as poly-<br>
vinylpyrrolidone, copolymers of vinyl propionate or acetate and vinylpyr-<br>
rolidone, partially saponified copolymers of an acrylate and acrylonitrile,<br>
polyvinyl alcohols having different residual acetate contents, cellulose<br>
ethers, gelatine, block copolymers, modified starch, low-molecular-weight<br>
polymers containing carboxyl and/or sulfonyl groups, or mixtures of these<br>
substances.<br>
Particularly preferred protective colloids are polyvinyl alcohols having a<br>
residual acetate content of less than 35 mol%, in particular from 5 to 39<br>
mol%, and/or vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl propionate copolymers having a vinyl<br>
ester content of less than 35% by weight, in particular from 5 to 30% by<br>
weight.<br>
It is possible to use nonionic or ionic emulsifiers, if desired also as a mix-<br>
ture. Preferred emulsifiers are optionally ethoxylated or propoxylated,<br>
relatively long-chain alkanols or alkylphenols having different degrees of<br>
ethoxylation or propoxylation (for example adducts with from 0 to 50 mol of<br>
alkylene oxide) or neutralised, sulfated, sulfonated or phosphated deriva-<br>
tives thereof. Neutralised dialkylsulfosuccinic acid esters or alkyldiphenyl<br>
oxide disulfonates are also particularly suitable.<br>
Particularly advantageous are combinations of these emulsifiers with the<br>
above-mentioned protective colloids, since particularly finely divided dis-<br>
persions are obtained therewith.<br>
Special processes for the production of monodisperse polymer particles<br>
have also already been described in the literature (for example R.C.<br>
Backus, R.C. Williams, J. Appl, Physics 19, p. 1186, (1948) and can<br>
advantageously be employed, in particular, for the production of the cores.<br>
It need merely be ensured here that the above-mentioned particle sizes<br>
are observed. A further aim is the greatest possible uniformity of the poly-<br>
mers. The particle size in particular can be set via the choice of suitable<br>
emulsifiers and/or protective colloids or corresponding amounts of these<br>
compounds.<br>
Through the setting of the reaction conditions, such as temperature, pres-<br>
sure, reaction duration and use of suitable catalyst systems, which influ-<br>
ence the degree of polymerisation in a known manner, and the choice of<br>
the monomers employed for their production — in terms of type and pro-<br>
portion - the desired property combinations of the requisite polymers can<br>
be set specifically. The particle size here can be set, for example, through<br>
the choice and amount of the initiators and other parameters., such as the<br>
reaction temperature. The corresponding setting of these parameters does<br>
not present any difficulties at all to the person skilled in the art in the area<br>
of polymerisation.<br>
Monomers which result in polymers having a high refractive index are<br>
generally those which contain aromatic moieties or those which contain<br>
hetero atoms having a high atomic number, such as, for example, halogen<br>
atoms, in particular bromine or iodine atoms, sulfur or metal ions, i.e.<br>
atoms or atomic groups which increase the polarisability of the polymers.<br>
Polymers having a low refractive index are accordingly obtained from<br>
monomers or monomer mixtures which do not contain the said moieties<br>
and/or atoms of high atomic number or only do so in a small proportion.<br>
A review of the refractive indices of various common homopolymers is<br>
given, for example, in Ullmanns Encyklopadie der technischen Chemie<br>
[Ullmann's Encyclopaedia of Industrial Chemistry], 5th Edition, Volume<br>
A21, page 169. Examples of monomers which can be polymerised by<br>
means of free radicals and result in polymers having a high refractive<br>
index are:<br>
Group a): styrene, styrenes which are alkyl-substituted on the phenyl<br>
ring, a-methylstyrene, mono- and dichlorostyrene, vinylnaphthalene, iso-<br>
propenylnaphthalene, isopropenylbiphenyl, vinylpyridine, isopropenyl-<br>
pyridine, vinylcarbazole, vinylanthracene, N-benzylmethacrylamide, p-<br>
hydroxymethacrylanilide.<br>
Group b): acrylates containing aromatic side chains, such as, for exam-<br>
ple, phenyl (meth)acrylate (= abbreviated notation for the two compounds<br>
phenyl acrylate and phenyl methacrylate), phenyl vinyl ether, benzyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, benzyl vinyl ether, and compounds of the formulae:<br>
In order to improve clarity and simplify the notation of carbon chains in the<br>
formulae above and below, only the bonds between the carbon atoms are<br>
shown. This notation corresponds to the depiction of aromatic cyclic com-<br>
pounds, where, for example, benzene is depicted by a hexagon with alter-<br>
nating single and double bonds.<br>
Also suitable are compounds containing sulfur bridges instead of oxygen<br>
bridges, such as, for example:<br>
In the above formulae, R stands for hydrogen or methyl. The phenyl rings<br>
in these monomers may carry further substituents. Such substituents are<br>
suitable for modifying the properties of the polymers produced from these<br>
monomers within certain limits. They can therefore be used in a targeted<br>
manner to optimise, in particular, the applicationally relevant properties of<br>
the mouldings according to the invention.<br>
Suitable substituents are, in particular, halogen, NO2, alkyl groups having<br>
one to twenty C atoms, preferably methyl, alkoxides having one to twenty<br>
C atoms, carboxyalkyl groups having one to twenty C atoms, carbonylalkyl<br>
groups having one to twenty C atoms or -OCOO-alkyl groups having one<br>
to twenty C atoms. The alkyl chains in these radicals may themselves<br>
optionally be substituted or interrupted by divalent hetero atoms or groups,<br>
such as, for example, -O-, -S-, -NH-, -COO-, -OCO- or -OCOO-, in non-<br>
adjacent positions.<br>
Group c): monomers containing hetero atoms, such as, for example,<br>
vinyl chloride, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, acrylic acid, methacrylic acid,<br>
acrylamide and methacrylamide, or organometallic compound, such as, for<br>
example,<br>
Group d): an increase in the refractive index of polymers is also<br>
achieved by copolymerisation of carboxyl-containing monomers and con-<br>
version of the resultant "acidic" polymers into the corresponding salts with<br>
metals of relatively high atomic weight, such as, for example, preferably<br>
with K, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Sn or Cd.<br>
The above-mentioned monomers, which make a considerable contribution<br>
towards the refractive index of the polymers prepared therefrom, can be<br>
homopolymerised or copolymerised with one another. They can also be<br>
copolymerised with a certain proportion of monomers which make a lesser<br>
contribution towards the refractive index. Such copolymerisable monomers<br>
having a lower refractive index contribution are, for example, acrylates,<br>
methacrylates, vinyl ethers or vinyl esters containing purely aliphatic radi-<br>
cals.<br>
In addition, crosslinking agents which can be employed for the production<br>
of crosslinked polymer cores from polymers produced by means of free<br>
radicals are also all bi- or polyfunctional compounds which are copoly-<br>
merisable with the above-mentioned monomers or which can subsequently<br>
react with the polymers with crosslinking.<br>
Examples of suitable crosslinking agents will be presented below, divided<br>
into groups for systematisation:<br>
Group 1: bisacrylates, bismethacrylates and bisvinyl ethers of aromatic<br>
or aliphatic di- or polyhydroxyl compounds, in particular of butanediol<br>
(butanediol di(meth)acrylate, butanediol bisvinyl ether), hexanediol (hex-<br>
anediol di(meth)acrylate, hexanediol bisvinyl ether), pentaerythritol,<br>
hydroquinone, bishydroxyphenylmethane, bishydroxyphenyl ether, bis-<br>
hydroxymethylbenzene, bisphenol A or with ethylene oxide spacers, pro-<br>
pylene oxide spacers or mixed ethylene oxide/propylene oxide spacers.<br>
Further crosslinking agents from this group are, for example, di- or poly-<br>
vinyl compounds, such as divinyibenzene, or methylenebisacrylamide, tri-<br>
allyl cyanurate, divinylethyleneurea, trimethylolpropane tri(meth)acrylate,<br>
trimethylolpropane trivinyl ether, pentaerythritol tetra(meth)acrylate, penta-<br>
erythritol tetravinyl ether, and crosslinking agents having two or more dif-<br>
ferent reactive ends, such as, for example, (meth)allyl (meth)acrylates of<br>
the formulae:<br>
(in which R denotes hydrogen or methyl).<br>
Group 2: reactive crosslinking agents which act in a crosslinking man-<br>
ner, but in most cases in a post-crosslinking manner, for example during<br>
warming or drying, and which are copolymerised into the core or shell<br>
polymers as copolymers.<br>
Examples thereof are: N-methylol(meth)acrylamide, acrylamidoglycolic<br>
acid, and ethers and/or esters thereof with C1 to C6-alcohols, diacetone-<br>
acrylamide (DAAM), glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), methacryloyloxypropyl-<br>
trimethoxysilane (MEMO), vinyltrimethoxysilane, m-isopropenylbenzyl iso-<br>
cyanate (TMI).<br>
Group 3: carboxyl groups which have been incorporated into the poly-<br>
mer by copolymerisation of unsaturated carboxylic acids are crosslinked in<br>
a bridge-like manner via polyvalent metal ions. The unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acids employed for this purpose are preferably acrylic acid, methacrylic<br>
acid, maleic anhydride, itaconic acid and fumaric acid. Suitable metal ions<br>
are Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Sn, Cd. Particular<br>
preference is given to Ca, Mg and Zn, Ti and Zr. In addition, monovalent<br>
metal ions, such as, for example, Na or K, are also suitable.<br>
Group 4: post-crosslinked additives, which are taken to mean bis- or<br>
polyfunctionalised additives which react irreversibly with the polymer (by<br>
addition or preferably condensation reactions) with formation of a network.<br>
Examples thereof are compounds which contain at least two of the follow-<br>
ing reactive groups per molecule: epoxide, aziridine, isocyanate acid chlo-<br>
ride, carbodiimide or carbonyl groups, furthermore, for example,<br>
3,4-dihydroxyimidazolinone and derivatives thereof (®Fixapret@ products<br>
from BASF).<br>
As already explained above, post-crosslinking agents containing reactive<br>
groups, such as, for example, epoxide and isocyanate groups, require<br>
complementary reactive groups in the polymer to be crosslinked. Thus,<br>
isocyanates react, for example, with alcohols to give urethanes, with<br>
amines to give urea derivatives, while epoxides react with these comple-<br>
mentary groups to give hydroxyethers and hydroxyamines respectively.<br>
The term post-crosslinking is also taken to mean photochemical curing or<br>
oxidative or air- or moisture-induced curing of the systems.<br>
The above-mentioned monomers and crosslinking agents can be com-<br>
bined and (co)polymerised with one another as desired and in a targeted<br>
manner in such a way that an optionally crosslinked (co)polymer having<br>
the desired refractive index and the requisite stability criteria and mecha-<br>
nical properties is obtained.<br>
It is also possible additionally to copolymerise further common monomers,<br><br>
for example acrylates, methacrylates, vinyl esters, butadiene, ethylene or<br>
styrene, in order, for example, to set the glass transition temperature or<br>
the mechanical properties of the core and/or shell polymers as needed.<br>
It is likewise preferred in accordance with the invention for the application<br>
of the shell of organic polymers to be carried out by grafting, preferably by<br>
emulsion polymerisation or ATR polymerisation. The methods and mono-<br>
mers described above can be employed correspondingly here.<br>
The following examples are intended to explain the invention in greater<br>
detail without limiting it.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Production of the core/shell particles<br>
A mixture, held at 4°C, consisting of 1519 g of deionised water, 2.8 g of<br>
1,4-butanediol diacrylate (MERCK), 25.2 g of styrene (MERCK) and<br>
1030 mg of sodium dodecylsulfate (MERCK) is introduced into a 51 jack-<br>
eted reactor, held at 75°C and fitted with double-propeller stirrer, argon<br>
protective-gas inlet and reflux condenser and dispersed with vigorous stir-<br>
ring.<br>
Immediately thereafter, the reaction is initiated by successive injection of<br>
350 mg of sodium dithionite (MERCK), 1.75 g of ammonium peroxodisul-<br>
fate (MERCK) and a further 350 mg of sodium dithionite (MERCK), each<br>
dissolved in about 20 ml of water. The injection is carried out by means of<br>
disposable syringes.<br>
After 20 min, a monomer emulsion consisting of 56.7 g of 1,4-butanediol<br>
diacrylate (MERCK), 510.3 g of styrene (MERCK), 2.625 g of sodium do-<br>
decylsulfate (MERCK), 0.7 g of KOH and 770 g of water is metered in con-<br>
tinuously over a period of 120 min via the rotary piston pump.<br>
The reactor contents are stirred for 30 min without further addition.<br>
A second monomer emulsion consisting of 10.5 g of allyl methacrylate<br>
(MERCK), 94.50 g of methyl methacrylate (MERCK), 0.525 g of sodium<br>
dodecylsulfate (MERCK) and 140g of water is subsequently metered in<br>
continuously over a period of 30 min via the rotary piston pump.<br>
After about 15 min, 350 mg of ammonium peroxodisulfate (MERCK) are<br>
added, and the mixture is then stirred for a further 15 min.<br>
Finally, a third monomer emulsion consisting of 200 g of ethyl acrylate<br>
(MERCK), 0.550 g of sodium dodecylsulfate (MERCK) and 900 g of water<br>
is metered in continuously over a period of 240 min via the rotary piston<br>
pump. The mixture is subsequently stirred for a further 120 min.<br>
Before and after each introduction of monomer emulsions and after intro-<br>
duction of the initial mixture, argon is passed into the jacketed reactor as<br>
protective-gas cushion for about one minute.<br>
Next day, the reactor is warmed to 95°C, and a steam distillation is carried<br>
out in order to remove residual unreacted monomers from the latex disper-<br>
sion.<br>
This results in a dispersion of core/shell particles in which the shell has a<br>
proportion by weight of about 22%. The core of polystyrene is crosslinked,<br>
the interlayer is likewise crosslinked ( p(MMA-co-ALMA)) and serves for<br>
grafting the shell of uncrosslinked ethyl acrylate.<br>
Example 2: Production of an inverse opal structure<br>
In order to form the template-forming structure, i.e. the organisation of the<br>
core/shell particles in spherical close packing, 5 g of the latex dispersion<br>
are poured into a shallow glass dish having a diameter of 7 cm and dried<br>
in air, giving flakes which shimmer in colours.<br>
One such flake is evacuated in a round-bottomed flask using a rotary<br>
slide-valve oil pump. A precursor solution consisting of 5 ml of tetra-n-butyl<br>
orthotitanate in 5 ml of absolute ethanol is subsequently added in a static<br>
vacuum so that the dissolved precursor, driven by capillary forces, is able<br>
to penetrate into the cavities of the template. An argon cushion is added<br>
above the solution containing the impregnated template. This arrangement<br>
is left to stand for a few hours before the impregnated flake is removed in<br>
a stream of argon protective gas and calcined at 500°C in a corundum<br>
boat in a tubular furnace.<br>
As a result, inverse structures are obtained which consist of closest-<br>
packed cavities in TiO2 (Figure 1).<br>
