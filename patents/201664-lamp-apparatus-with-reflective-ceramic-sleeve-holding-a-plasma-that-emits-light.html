				<td>LAMP APPARATUS WITH REFLECTIVE CERAMIC SLEEVE HOLDING A<br>
PLASMA THAT EMITS LIGHT Inventor;   DALE S.WALKER<br>
SPECIFICATION BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Reid of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a high temperature, high efficiency lamp apparatus wfthi an improved configuration that produces a beam of light using a bulb containrtg a fill that is energized to vaporize the fill,   More particularly, the present invention relates to a projectrrg system that features a lamp in which light energy is generated by a plasma contained inside a eyiffidtai tmmfc sfceve tot has a surface with reflect proper^es,<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
High power lamps are-used for Illumination applications beyond typical incandescent and florescent lamps. One type of lamp known as a high intensity discharge (HID) lamp consists of a gfess envelope and a fill, which vaporizes and becomes a gas when the (amp is operated. U.S. Patent 5,404,076, issued to Dolan, et al and entitted *Lamp Including Sulfur," discloses an eleetrodefess lamp with a fill of sulfur selenium, or compounds of these substances. The fill is excifced through electromagnetic energy supplied from external electrodes. The Dolan, et al, patent S(404(0?6 is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Projecting systems are used to display images on large surfaces, such as a computer displays or television screens. For example, fri a front projection system, an Image beam is projected from an image source onto the front side of a reflection-type angle transforming screen, which then reflects the light toward a viewer positioned In front of the screen. In a mar projection system, the image beam Is projected onto the rear side of a transmission-type angle transforming screen and transmitted toward a viewer located in front of the screen.<br>
ft-ior co-pending U.S. patent application Serial Ho. 08/581,108, enticed ^Projecting Images/ to Khox, filed December 29, 1995, discloses a method of displaying an optical image by projecting the image along an optical path and at my optical device interposed across the optical path, at one time reftectrtg the image from the optical device &amp;rtd at a different trme permitting the mage to pass through the optical device to be displaced, U,S. application 08/581,108, entitled 'Projectrig Images/ to Khox, filed December 29, 1995, is fricorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
The image source for such projection systems employ* a light that must be of high intensity mid preferably produced very efficiently. Further, the light is prefciably piovided from a very small aperture, as close to be a "point source" as possible. If an optical image is to bft displayed by projection, it sometimes passes through an optical device interposed across the optical path. In the projection system of prior co-pending application OS/581 JOS, filed December 29, 1995, one or more optical devices reflect the image at one time from the optical device and at a different time permit the image to pass through the optical device to be displayed. There will be a decrease in light intensity once the optical image strikes the optical device interposed across the optical path. Therefore, in projection systems where an optical device is interposed across the optical path there is a need for a projection engine with a high intensity light of improved efficiency. U.S. patent application serial no. 08/747,190, entitled "High Efficiency Lamp Apparatus for Producing a Beam of Polarized Light," to Knox, et a!., filed November 12, 190t&gt;, discloses a high efficiency lamp apparatus for producing polarized light. The apparatus redirects reflected light of one polarity back to light source. U.S. application serial no. 08/747,190 is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According: to the present invention, a high temperature, high efficiency lamp apparatus is provided with an improved configuration that produces light from a Small apertuie using a bulb containing a fill which may be energized with externally placed electrodes. According to the present invention, the lamp body is in the form of an elongated outer tube having a hollow interior that contains an inner sleeve. The inner sleeve has a fill containing bore. Alternatively, the electrodes could be placed between the sleeve and the outer tube.<br>
The sleeve also provides a reflective surface* either added as a coating or being an intrinsic property of the sleeve Electrodes are preferably positioned externally of the lamp body for producing electromagnetic energy that can excite the contained fill within the bore of the inner sleeve to form a nSasma Vmht source A \whi beam is generated hv the nl&amp;stna Heht source that exits the lamp body via a small aperture in the sleeve bore.<br>
In one embodiment, the light beam generated by the plasma light source exits both ends of the sleeve via the bore. In another embodiment, the sleeve is closed so that the light only exits one end of the bore.<br>
2<br><br>
In one cmboHinusnl, the ftloovo hi CKUH the housing fn anollicr cmlxwlim
The sleeve is preferably of a temperature resistant material such as ceramic (cither solid or porous) that can withstand the high temperatures generated by a plasma light source of between about 425°C and 3600°C. While the sleeve should be selected with particular attention to its thermal, reflective, and chemical interactions with the plasma, the housing should withstand the pressure and vacuum requirements associated with the plasma while freely passing the emitted light<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Figures 1-3 show the first embodiment of the lamp apparatus of the present invention designated generally by the numeral 10A. Lamp apparatus 10A includes outer housing 11 having bore 12. Bore 12 communicates with inner cylindrical surface 13 of housing 11 Housing 11 has closed end 14 portion that is hemispherically shaped. End portion of housing 11 opposite hemispherical end 14 is closed with plate 15 as shown in Figures 1 and 2. Housing 11 can have a longitudinally extending cylindrically shaped outer surface 16 in between its end portions as shown in the drawings Figures 1-3. The lamp apparatus 10A is shown with a hemispherical end 14. It will be understood that a variety of end portions could instead be used. Some of these are illustrated below in the embodiments of Figures 2-13 and 15-16. It may be preferable that the hemispherical end 14 be replaced with other configurations that provide for different optical effects. Alternatives include a plate, a lens, a light pipe, etc. Similarly, the plate 15 could be replaced with a light pipe, hemispherical end, etc. Regarding all of the embodiments of Figures 1-13, 15 and 16, it will be appreciated that the variety of features shown in each can in large part be interchanged with the other described embodiments<br>
Bore 12 holds cylindrically shaped sleeve 17. Sleeve 17 is preferably of a heat resistant material such as ceramic. Sleeve 17 must withstand the high temperatures that arc generated by plasma 23 during use. Sleeve 17 has a generally cylindrically. shaped outer surface 18 and corresponding inner cylindrically shaped surface 19. Although sleeve 17 must withstand high temperatures, it does not necessarily need to contain pressure or vacuum. Instead, housing 11 should be of a material that can withstand pressure or vacuum, depending on ihe mode of operation of lamp apparatus 10A,<br>
4<br><br>
DEC   i£    '97      11:10AM	F.£x8<br>
Sleeve 17 provides cylinrirically shaped bore 20 and open end portions 21, 22. During use, plasma 23 is formed within bore 20 ot sleeve W.  Bore iz or housing 11 ana core zu or<br>
sleeve 17 each contain sulfur, selenium, or some other fill material that can be excited to form a plasma 23. A pair of electrodes 24 are positioned externally of outer cylindrical surface 16 of housing U as shown in Figures 1-2<br>
Although sleeve 17 is shown with open end portions 21 and 22, as is discussed below in conjunction with the various embodiments, both ends are not necessarily open<br>
Electrodes 24, 25 provide energy that forms plaoma 23. Because electrodes 24, 25 are positioned externally of lamp housing 11, they are not subjected tn the very intense heat of plasma 23 during use. Although electrodes 24, 25 are shown external to the lamp apparatus 10A, they can be internal, as discussed below in conjunction wiih Figuics 12 and 17 Further, electrodes 24, 25 are shown for conceptual purposes only. The actual configuration of the electrodes would probably be in the form of curved plates, or flat plates, as.described^in conjunctions with Figures 14 and 15 below.<br>
In Figure 1, arrow 26 indicates a beam uf light that c*il&gt; through clear plate 15 and can be used for lighting in a projection type display system. Again, although clear plate 15 is shown, a variety of other optical and mechanical configurations can be used, as is discussed below in the various embodiments. Further, however, the sleeve 17 is preferably made of a ceramic material that not only resists high temperatures, but also provides reflection for light. The ceramic material which forms sleeve 17 is pi efci ably either a specular reflector or, is white or of other color or enrferp Qiir.h that light emitted by plasma 23 is reflected oi absorbed and rccmittcd, maintaining high efficiency. In this way, the light from plasma 23 ultimately exit* ihiougli open end portion 22. A reflector could be positioned behind the open end portion 21, for example, to cause light emitted from that end to be reflected back through bore 20. Or, the open end portion<br>
21	could instead be closed, as is described in embodiments discussed below.   In any case,<br>
although plasma 23 occupies a large volume, the light exits through a small surface area formed<br>
by the open end portion 22.  Generally, projection displays benefit from a point light source, or<br>
other light source provided through a small apertuie.  The URG of bore 20 and open end portion<br>
22	results in a better approximation of such a point source.<br>
A radio frequency energy source 100 provides a radio frequency (or other suitable fiequency) signal to electrodes 24, 25, which in turn transmit radio frequency "nciyy lo ihe gns in Uoies 12 and 20. Again, electrodes 24, 25 as shown arc generally conceptual, with actual configurations being discussed below in conjunction with Figures 14 and 15.   Further, other<br>
5<br><br>
frequencies of energy could be provided, whatever is appropriate to excite the fill to a plasma state forming plasma 23.<br>
In Figures 4 and 5, a second embodiment of the lamp apparatus of the present invention is shown, designated generally by the numeral 10B In Figures 4 and 5, lamp housing 27 has outer generally cylindrically shaped surface 28 and a pair of opposed end portions 29, 30. Lamp housing 27 has inner generally cylindrically shaped surface 3] and a pair of inner surfaces 32, 33 at opposed end portions of lamp housing 27- Lamp housing 27 provides interior 34 for containing a fill material such as sulfur or selenium or other'fill that can be excited to form plasma 40. Figures 6 and 7 also show the construction of housings 11 and 27.<br>
Cylindrically shaped heat resistant sleeve 35 is contained within interior 34 of lamp housing 27. Sleeve 35 has a cylindrically shaped inner surface 36, a cylindrical!)' shaped outer surface 37, and opposed open end portions 38, 39.<br>
In the embodiment of Figure 4, light can be directed in two directions if desired thYougft the ends 29, 30 of lamp housing 27 as shown by arrows 50 As with the embodiment of Figures 1-3, plasma 40 is formed using a gas such as sulfur or selenium or other fill contained within interior 34. The contained gas can be excited using electrodes 24, 25 to form plasma 40. Electrodes 24, 25 are positioned externally of outer surface 28 of housing 27 so that electrodes 24, 25 are not subjected to the intense heat of plasma 40.<br>
Figures 8 and 9 show a third embodiment of the lamp apparatus of the present invention, designated generally by the numeral 10C. In the embodiment of Figures 8 and 9, lamp apparatus IOC is similar in construction to the embodiment of Figures 4 and 5. However, in Figures 8 and 9, a gap 41 is provided in between housing 27 and sleeve 35.<br>
In Figure 10, there is seen a fourth embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention designated generally by the numeral I0D. Lamp apparatus 10D of Figure 10 is similar to the construction of lamp apparatus IOB of Figures 4 and 5, and housing 27 is of the same construction as the housing shown in Figures 8 and 9. However, interior 34 of housing 27 carries closed ended sleeve 42 having closed end 43 with a surface 4(5. The sleeve 42 has open end 45. Interior 34 of housing 27 contains a material such as sulfur that can be excited using electrodes 24 and 25 to form plasma 48.<br>
Sleeve 42 has a generally cylindrically shaped inner surface 47 that extends along the of<br>
the length of sleeve 42 es shown In Figure 10. Sleeve 42 has generally cyllndrlcalfy shaped outer<br>
surface 49 that conforms to, and preferably abuts, the inner surface 31 of housing 27.   In the<br>
-4~<br><br>
nbodinicnis of Figures 8-9 mid 10, airows 50 inclicato the diiaction of light exiling iho lump iiOusiug 27.<br>
Turning to Figure 11, shown is yet another embodiment 10E of the lamp apparatus according to the invention. Lamp apparatus 10E is similar to the previous embodiments, but is shown to have flat ends 51 and 52, with a cylindrical housing 53. In this embodiment however, a sleeve 54 is formed by coating all interior sides of cylindrical housing 53 as well as the end portion 52. This could be done with a variety of techniques for depositing ceramics, for example It will be appreciated that by using ceramic coatings, or coatings of other material, the various embodiments of the lamp apparatus could be similarly constructed. In lamp apparatus 10E, a plasma 55 again causes the emission of light SO.<br>
Turning to Figure 12, yet another embodiment 10F of the lamp apparatus according to the invention is Shown. This embodiment is similar to lamp apparatus 10E of Figure 11, employing the same end portions 51 and 52 and the same housing 53. In this embodiment, however, electrodes 56 and 57 are preferably either deposited or placed in the interior of housing 53. Then, a coating 58 is applied over those electrodes 56 and 57, thus protecting electrodes 56 and 57 from the heat of a plasma 59. Similar internal electrodes could be used with other embodiments according to the invention, preferably with the insulating sleeve or coating placed between the electrodes and the plasma.<br>
Turning to Figure 13, a lamp apparatus 10G is shown, which in this case has a housing 60 that is formed from drawn glass, rather than being constructed as the previous embodiments. In embodiment 10G, housing 60 includes a light pipe 61 through which light 50 is transmitted Also enclosed within housing 60 is preferably a lens 62 which focuses light from a plasma 63 onto light pipe 61. Again, lamp apparatus 10G includes an internal coating 64, similar to the internal coatings 54 and 58 of lamp apparatus 10E and lamp apparatus 10F It will thus be appreciated that a variety of techniques can be used to construct lamp apparatus 10 according to thft invention.<br>
Turning to Figures 14 and 15, two sets ofclcctiodcs 65A and 653, and 66A and 66B arc shown. These are simply illustrative of appropriate actual configurations for the various electrodes shown in the embodiments of Figures 1-13, 16, and 17 and it will be appreciated that a variety of other electrode configurations are possible without detracting from the spirit of the invention.<br>
Thus, in lamp appaiatus 10 constructed according to the invention, an internal coating or ceramic sleeve is both heat resistant, insulating, and preferably effectively reflective of the<br>
7<br><br>
intense light generated by a plasma source.   Thic coating reflecte light and protects the housing<br>
from high temperature. The housing is then optimized to withstand pressure or vacuum as<br>
necessary depending on the state of the plasma. This allows lower temperature materials to be<br>
u&amp;cd fv" lUc housing, resulting in increased efficiency of light omission.1. Further, by providing<br>
the sleeve, light is internally reflected until emitted from a relatively small apeiluic at mi end of<br>
the housing, resulting in more of a point source which is desirable for a number of projection<br>
systems.     :	-    .<br>
Tuning lu Figuies 1G and 17, additional embodiments 1011 and 101 are shown, illustrating how diffinenl housing shapes can be employed in implementing a lamp according to the invention. In Figure 16, the lamp apparatus 10H is shown, having a housing 67 that is spherical, rather than cylindrical. In the illustrated embodiment, a reflective and thermal controlling mating 08 Is provided wlr.ll an aperture 09, again Insulating and piuiwliug housing 67 Hum a plasma 70.<br>
In this particular embodiment 10H, external electrodes 71 are used.  The embodiment 101 of Figure 17 is of similar shape, employing the same housing 67, but instead of coating 68, a formed reflector 72 is employed, with interior electrodes 73 between reflector 72 and housing 67. This illustrates as with embodiments I0A-10G how a variety of shapes and configurations can be used in a lamp apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Turning to Figure 18, a system S in which lamp apparatus 1OD would preferably be used is illustrated. Housing 27 with close ended sleeve 42 is positioned within the body of a reflector 102 with an inner reflecting surface 104. Light is directed out of the end of housing 27 into an area 106 formed by reflector 102, The high intensity light from housing 27 is transmitted through a reflective interference filter 108, which only passes desired frequencies of light and reflects remaining frequencies back into housing 21, so that preferably that reflected light is reabsorbed by plasma 48 and re-emitted. The selected frequencies of light then pass through a reflective polarizing filter 110, which passes light of a desired polarity and reflects remaining components of light back through mirror 108 and into housing 27, agiain for reabsorption. This system S is preferably used in applications that require polarized light, such as the Projector Lamp Optics Assembly disclosed in copending U.S. patent application serial no. 08/730,S18? entitled "Image Projection System Engine Assembly," to Knox, filed on October 17, 1996, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
