				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention in general relates to the field of mobile devices. In particular, the invention proposes a method of knowing the location of a mobile station (MS) in GSM/UMTS systems using Cell Broadcast (CB) information.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
There have been efforts to develop such system where one can attempt to get the location of a handheld or mobile subscriber. But these systems do not provide any such direct service where one can have the knowledge about the exact or approximate location of a subscriber. Recently with GPS integration of these devices it is possible to get the location of a subscriber which works on GPS technology.<br>
GPS integrated handled are being used by Kids and parents can track their children’s location and their moves also. Similarly one can use these GPS enable devices for tracking their loved ones. All of this is getting driven from the web tracking/web logging of kids/loved ones. Similarly in wireless domains too this tracking and spying exists. This is done with the help of GPS systems. Verizons Chaperone service is recently launched to track your kids in their play, school or tuition areas.<br>
However with the existing system this is possible only with the GPS enabled devices. There is no such support in the non GPS enable devices for the exact<br>
 <br>
or approximate location of a subscriber. Still most of the handheld users are not capable of the GPS. GPS gives the exact location. For the Non GPS users this method can be useful in tracking by accessing their cell names using a SMS trigger.<br>
In patent publication no. WO2001028271A1, titled,” LOCATION SYSTEM FOR MOBILE TELEPHONES AND METHOD OF PRESENTATION OF POSITION”, it proposes a system for determining geographical location of a mobile station. The mobile station can provide guidance information to a user about how to move to a desired destination. The location is provided to the mobile station, with the help of SMS-CB message broadcast by the base station, and is shown to the user as a map or as a name of the location. After the location of the mobile station is determined, the user is provided with an option whether to transmit his location to other mobile stations. The information regarding the location of the user can be transmitted by means of an SMS and/or a voice call. Additionally, this information may be automatically transmitted based on a predetermined event. However, the publication does not explicitly specify the events (for example - one of the event in case of tracking, could be whenever there is a change in location) when this information is automatically transmitted to other mobile stations. The publication also mentions about transmittal of location information using a voice call (in case of an emergency), though automatic text-to-speech conversion has not been explicitly specified.<br>
In another patent publication no. GB2352128A, titled,” LOCATION ALERTING WITHIN CELLULAR NETWORKS”, it proposes a mobile phone in which<br>
 <br>
characteristics of radio signals broadcast in selected locations by transmitters of cellular networks are stored and compared with the characteristics of radio signals received in the current location of the mobile phone. In response to a match between received characteristics in the current location and the stored characteristics of a selected location, an alarm signal is generated. Base station identities contained in the Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH) broadcasts are used to determine the current location of the mobile phone. An alerting signal is generated when a communications receiver leaves a selected location. The alerting signal may be used to generate a voice message, SMS message, electronic mail, a request for data, etc. However, the publication focuses on the concept of generating alerts based on the change in location of the mobile station, and does not explicitly mention if the location information of the mobile station can be sent to a second mobile station based on the query sent by the second mobile station.<br>
Yet another patent publication no. DE10235959A1, titled,” MOBILE STATION TRACKING SYSTEM FOR A GEOGRAPHICAL LOCALIZATION OF A MOBILE STATION IN A CELLULAR WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORK BASED ON INFORMATION CONTAINED IN A TEXT OR SMS MESSAGE”, proposes a method of geographically tracking a mobile station in a communication network. The mobile station recovers location relevant information circulated by a base station. A text or SMS message containing this information is sent to a tracking station. The geographical position of the mobile station is then determined on the basis of the information contained in the text message. However, the publication does not mention about auto-replying to a call using text-to-speech conversion<br>
 <br>
for calling parties permitted to access the location information of the mobile station.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In GSM/UMTS systems we get SMS - CB messages transmitted from the network regularly as part of the CBS service. There are many updates given using this service. One of the useful parameter that we get in these messages is geographical name of the cell. We can utilize this information for the purpose of getting the location of another handheld. When a handled is queried by another handled for its location using an SMS, the target handheld in response will give trigger a SMS having the cell name in it. This way one can know the location of another person. But this shall always be controlled to avoid any invasion. This method does give an approximate location of a subscriber and does not need any GPS for this purpose.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a method of knowing the location of a mobile station (MS) in GSM/UMTS systems using cell broadcast (CB) information comprising the steps of:<br>
transmitting SMS-CB messages to mobile stations at regular intervals by a base station where the SMS-CB messages include location of the cell in which the individual mobile stations are located;<br>
receiving and storing the location information by the mobile station;<br>
 <br>
a source mobile station sending a query to the target mobile station when a source mobile station wants to know the location of a target mobile station; and<br>
the target mobile station utilizing the location information received from the base station and passes the location information to the source mobile station.<br>
The frequency at which CBS messages are repeatedly transmitted dependent on the information that they contain. The repetition period of CBS messages gets changed by high speed mobiles which rapidly traverse cells. If the target mobile station is set into a driving mode, on receiving the query regarding the location of the target mobile station, the target mobile station auto answers the query with text to speech conversion of the location name.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
 <br>
Wireless communication is not just limited to voice services. There has been lot of enhancements in wireless technology from the first generation. Many different varieties of services are being offered. One of these is Cell broadcast short message services. The CBS service is analogous to the Teletex service offered on television, in that like Teletex, it permits a number of unacknowledged general CBS messages to be broadcast to all receivers within a particular region. CBS messages are broadcasted to pre-defined geographical areas known as cell broadcast areas. These areas may comprise of one or more cells, or may comprise the entire PLMN. Individual CBS messages will be assigned their own geographical coverage areas by mutual agreement between the information provider and the PLMN operator. CBS messages may originate from a number of Cell Broadcast Entities (CBEs), which are connected to the Cell Broadcast Centre. CBS messages are then sent from the CBC to the cells, in accordance with the CBS’s coverage requirements.<br>
A CBS page comprises of 82 octets, which, using the default character set, equates to 93 characters. Other Data Coding Schemes may also be used, as described in 3GPP TS 23.038 [3]. Up to 15 of these pages may be concatenated to form a CBS message. Each page of such CBS message will have the same message identifier (indicating the source of the message), and the same serial number. Using this information, the MS/UE is able to identify and ignore re-broadcasts of already received messages.<br>
CBS messages are broadcast cyclically by the cell at a frequency and for a duration agreed with the information provider. The frequency at which CBS<br>
 <br>
messages are repeatedly transmitted will be dependent on the information that they contain; for example, it is likely that dynamic information such as road traffic information, will require more frequent transmission than weather information. The repetition period will also be affected by the desire for CBS messages to be received by high speed mobiles which rapidly traverse cells. Reception of CBS messages for a MS/UE is not a requirement if it is connected in the CS domain. It should be possible for a UE to receive messages if it is connected in the PS domain and no data is currently transmitted.<br>
 <br>
NOTE: In case the UE is in CS-ldle and PS-Connected Mode it depends on the Radio Resource Control State whether reception of CBS messages is possible. The relevant states are described in 3GPP TS 25.331 [16].<br>
GSM only [CBS messages may be broadcast on two different cell broadcast channels, which are characterized by different QoS. A MS is always able to read the basic channel (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [8]). The reading of the extended channel may collide with other tasks of the MS. Therefore the probability of receiving a CBS message on the extended channel is smaller than on the basic channel. The reading of the extended channel for MS’s is optional. The scheduling on the channels will be done independently].<br>
 <br>
To permit mobiles to selectively display only those CBS messages required by the MS/UE user, CBS messages are assigned a message class which categorizes the type of information that they contain and the language (Data Coding Scheme) in which the CBS message has been compiled. Through the use of appropriate MMI, the user is then able to ignore message types that he does not wish to receive, e.g. advertising information or messages in an unfamiliar language.<br>
In figure 1 and 2 the topology of the networks is shown whereitfit illustrates how the MS is connected to the CBC and it keeps getting the periodic CB messages regularly. Figure 2 shows the GSM network CBS service and location exchange using SMS.<br>
In GSM, BTS transmits CBS Message (information for the user- one of them is Cell name) to the MS. Each page of a CBS Message sent to the MS by the BTS is a fixed block of 88 octets as coded in 3GPP TS 24.012 [7]. This is sent on the channel allocated as CBCH by 3GPP TS 45.002 [8]. The 88 octets of the CBS Message are formatted as described below.<br>
 <br>
Content of the message contains the parameter of our interest. We can use this content where cell name string comes and store is for our retrieval purpose.<br>
 <br>
Similarly Figure 1 shows scenario of location access in the UMTS network CBS services and location exchange using SMS. In UMTS, CBS messages (having user information like cell name) are transmitted by the RNS to the UE. The CBS message is transmitted as one unit over the radio interface. On layer two of the UMTS radio interface the logical channel CTCH is used. Message parameters are described below<br>
 <br>
CB data contains the parameter of our interest. Here also we can use this content where cell name string comes and store is for our retrieval purpose.<br>
In the CB message the cell name comes as message content or CB data. Depending on the geographical scope of the message either it is displayed immediately or it is normally kept for the user to see that information.<br>
CB message are transmitted regularly from the network to MS/UE. The proposed algorithm is as follows:<br>
a. Compose a query message (e.g. a special data access mechanism to access the data in of a remote mobile) and send to the subscriber u want to<br>
 <br>
know the location as shown in figure 3.<br>
b. When the Target subscriber receives this message it sees the latest cell name given in the CB message (which it keeps for the display), composes a response message will content as cell name received and send it to the source subscriber as in figure 4.<br>
c. Figure 5 explains the scenario where the subscriber is not able to answer and the auto answering is enabled. For example when a subscriber is moving with some user profiles enabled (e.g. driving where a MT call is auto answered by saying the subscriber is driving), the CB data information about the location can be used for the purpose of answering the location name. In the auto answer the called subscriber (if caller is allowed to know the location of the called subscriber- the called subscriber will have control to allow a calling subscriber to give location name or not) can answer the location name by converting the location text into speech.<br>
d. Thus one can get the geographical name of the location of the cell in use. In urban deployments these cell sizes are of the order of the Pico cells and these names are basically these are names. So one can approximate location of a subscriber in a much easier way.<br>
The above mentioned logical flows are basic logical flows to understand the phenomenon. There can be other controls (e.g. making a permission password protected.) added in the actual implementation of this feature.<br>
 <br>
Thus we see this method simply utilizes the CBC service for the location parameter and SMS service for the getting this location from another subscriber. This location access can be done by any means remote access of mobile data base or any other explicit/implicit method.<br>
There are certain things which should be taken care while doing these accesses from these services. There should be some soft controls while using such feature. Not every body should be allowed to get your location.<br>
a.	For this purpose this should be controlled from MMI/UI so that one can permit a subscriber to get the location.<br>
b.	In case of tracking, the target subscriber should not be able to disable the tracker. It should be password protected. In this case there should be a password protection while allowing a subscriber so that the target subscriber can not disallow the tracker. This typical example here is parents to kids or ones loved ones.<br>
Similarly another way to use the cell identity name would be to when a subscriber handheld is being driven and is set into driving mode using the UI/MMI options. In this case the handheld can utilize this location name (cell name field in CB message) in many ways. For example while driving profile set, a subscriber gets a call, then one can trigger a SMS (containing the location name to the caller) or auto answering the call with Text to speech conversion of the location name.<br>
 <br>
Another way to use this cell location name will be to continuously get the update of one subscriber moves. If in the UE, whenever there is a change in the particular location (cell name), the pre set UE can be informed of the change in its location. This method of continuous updating can be enabled or disabled from the tracker.<br>
Thus the proposed invention enables tracking the approximate location of a non GPS GSM/UMTS handheld subscriber even if the subscriber is in auto answering mode using the CBS service, which is much cheaper.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
