2-(1H-IND0LYLSULFANYL)-BENZYL AMINE DERIVATIVES AS SSRI<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and preferably also norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, and the medical use of such compounds, e.g. in the treatment of depression and anxiety, affective disorders, pain disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and stress urinary incontinence.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The majority of currently available antidepressants can be classified in 3 classes:<br>
1)	monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),<br>
2)	biogenic amine neurotransmitter [serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA)] transporter reuptake blockers, and<br>
3)	modulators, especially blockers of one or more of the 5-HT and/or NE receptors.<br>
Since depression is associated with a relative deficiency of the biogenic amines, the use of 5-HT and/or NE-receptor blockers (i.e. 5-HT and or NE-antagonist's) have not proven very successful in the treatment of depression and anxiety and the preferred and currently most efficient treatments are based on the enhancement of 5-HT and/or NE neurotransmission by blocking their reuptake back from the synaptic cleft (Slattery, D.A. et al., "The evolution of antidepressant mcchamsms'\ fundamental and Clinical pharniacology, 2004,18,1-21; Schloss, P, et al, "new insights into the mechanism of antidepressant therapy", Pharmacology and therapeutics, 2004,102, 47-60).<br>
For years monoamine reuptake inhibition has been studied for treatment of depression, i.e. in particular the monoamines serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA).<br>
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (hereinafter referred to as SSRIs) have become first choice therapeutics in the treatment of depression, certain forms of anxiety and social phobias, because they generally are effective, well tolerated, and have a favourable safety profile compared to the classic tricyclic antidepressants. Drugs claimed to be SSRIs are for example fluoxetine, sertraline and paroxetine.<br><br>
However, clinical studies on depression indicate that non-response to the known SSRIs is substantial, up to 30%. Another, often neglected, factor in antidepressant treatment is compliance, which has a rather profound effect on the patient's motivation to continue pharmacotherapy. First of all, there is generally a delay in therapeutic effect of the SSRIs. Sometimes symptoms even worsen during the first weeks of treatment. Secondly, sexual dysfunction is generally a side effect common to SSRIs. Without addressing these problems, real progress in the pharmacotherapy of depression and anxiety disorders is not likely to happen. Accordingly, there is a need for the development of compounds capable of improving the treatment of depression and other serotonin related diseases.<br>
A newer strategy has been the development of dual re-uptake inhibitors, e.g., the combined effect of serotonin reuptake inhibition and norepinephrine (norepinephrine is also named noradrenaline, NA) reuptake inhibition on depression is explored in clinical studies of compounds such as Duloxetine (Wong, "Duloxetine (LY-248686): an inhibitor of serotonin and noradrenaline uptake and an antidepressant drug candidate", Expert Opinion on Investigational Drugs, 1998, 7, 10, 1691-1699) and Venlafaxine (Khan-A et al, 30 "Venlafaxine in depressed outpatients", Psychopharmacology Bulletin. 1991,27, 141-144). Compounds having such duel effect are also named SNRIs, "serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors", or NSRIs, "noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake inhibitors".<br>
Since treatment with the selective NE reuptake inhibitor reboxetine has been shown to stimulate 5-HT neurons and mediate the release of 5-HT in the brain (Svensson,T. et al, J. Neural. Transmission, 2004, 111, 127) there might be a synergistic advantage using SNRI's in the treatment of depression or anxiety.<br>
The use of SNRI's have been shown in clinical studies to have a beneficial effect on pain (e.g. Fibromyalgia syndrome, overall pain, back pain, shoulder pain, headache, pain while awake and during daily activities) and especially pain associated with depression (Berk, M. Expert Rev. Neurotherapeutics 2003, 3, 47-451; Fishbain, D.A., et al. "Evidence-based data from animal and human experimental studies on pain relief with antidepressants: A structured review" Pain Medicine 2000 1:310-316).<br><br>
SNRI's have also been shown in clinical studies to have a beneficial effect in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (N. M. Mukaddes; Venlafaxine in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, European Neuropsychopharmacology, Volume 12, Supplement 3, October 2002, Page 421).<br>
Furthermore, SNRI's have been shown to be effective for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (Dmochowski R.R. et al. "Duloxetine versus placebo for the treatment of North American women with stress urinary incontinence", Journal of Urology 2003,170:4, 1259-1263.)<br>
Furthermore, Axford L. et al. describe the development of triple 5-HT. NE and DA reuptake inhibitors for treatment of depression. (2003, Bioorganic &amp; Medical Chemistry Letters, 13, 3277-3280: "Bicyclo[2.2.1.]heptanes as novel triple re-uptake inhibitors for the treatment of depression"). Wellbutrin (bupropion) which has DA re-uptake activity in vitro and in vivo, show antidepressant efficacy. Other combination studies have indicated that addition of some affminity at the DA uptake site may have some clinical benefit (Nelson, J. C. J. Clin. Psychiatry 1998, 59, 65; Masand, P. S. et al Depression Aiixiety 1998, 7, 89; Bodkin, J. A et al. J. Clin. Psychiatry 1997, 58, 137).<br>
The present invention provides 2-(lH-indolylsulfanyl)-benzyl amine derivatives, formula I, which are serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In particular, the invention provides compounds possessing the combined effect of serotonin reuptake inhibition and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition. Furthermore, some of the compounds are also triple 5-HT, NE and DA re-uptake inhibitors.<br>
Diphenyl sulphides of formula (XVI) and variations thereof have been disclosed as serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and have been suggested for use in treatment of depression, cf. e.g. US 5095039, US 4056632, EP 396827 Al and WO 9312080. EP 402097 describes halogen substituted diphenylsulfides claimed to be selective serotonin inhibitors for treatment of depression. Likewise WO 9717325 discloses derivatives of N,N-dimethyl-2-(arylthio)benzylamine claimed to'be selective serotonin transport inhibitors and suggest their use as antidepressants. J. Jilek et al., 1989, Collect. Czeck Chem. Commun., 54, 3294-3338 also_discloses various derivatives of diphenyl sulphides, "phenyl-thio-benzylamines"<br><br>
as antidepressants. Furthermore, diphenyl sulphides are also disclosed in US 3803143 and claimed useful as antidepressant.<br><br>
Several publications relates to the use of derivatives of diphenyl sulphides as "radiopharmaceuticals" for imaging SERT by SPECT or PET imaging, e.g. "S. Oya et al. J. Med Chem. 2002, 45, 4716-4723" and "S. Oya et al. J. Med. Chem. 42, 3, 333-335". P. Emond et al (J. Med. Chem (2002) 45, 1253-1258) and HS. Oya et al. (J. Med. Chem. 42, 3, 333-335) further test and discuss substituted "diphenyl sulfides'1 as selective serotonin tranporter ligands relative to dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (DAT, NET) with measurements of vitro affinities at the dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine transporters.<br>
WO 0066537 also discloses certain derivatives of diphenyl sulphides claimed to be have higher selectivity for SERT over NET and DAT.<br>
US 4,018,830 and US 4,055,665 discloses "phenylthioaralkylamines" and "2-phenylthiobenzylamines" represented structurally as "Ari-S-Ar2 in which Ar; is aphenylakyl amine substitnent andAri is a substituted or unsubstituted homocyclic or heterocyclic ring of from 5-6 atoms, such as an aromatic ring, a heteroaromatic ring". The compounds are claimed to be useful for preventing "cardiac arrhythmias".<br>
K. Sindelar et al., "Collection of Czechoslovak Chemical Communications, (1991), 56(2), 449-58, by K. Sindelar et al" disclose variations of compounds of formula (XVI) in which one of the rings is substituted with a thiophene ring with test for selectivity as 5-HT reuptake inhibitor and NA re-uptake inhibitor, respectively, for use as antidepressants.<br><br>
US 6,596,741 B2 and US 6,436,938 Bl and US 6,410,736 Bl disclose biaryl ether derivates (XVII) reported to inhibit reuptake of monoamines, e.g. serotonin, dopamine and/or norepinephrine. <br>
None of the above references disclose compounds comprising an indole group like the indolyl-sulfanyl benzyl amines of the present invention.<br>

Pharmaceutical composition<br>
The compounds of the invention as the free base or the salt thereof may be administered . alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. The pharmaceutical compositions according to the invention may<br><br>
be formulated with pharmaceuticaliy acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional techniques such as those disclosed in Remington; The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 19 Edition, Gennaro, Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1995.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be specifically formulated for administration by any suitable route such as the oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, topical (including buccal and sublingual), transdermal, intracisternal, intraperitoneal, vaginal and parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal) route, the oral route being preferred. It will be appreciated that the preferred route wall depend on the general condition and age of the subject to be treated, the nature of the condition to be treated and the active ingredient chosen.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration include solid dosage forms such as capsules, tablets, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and granules. Where appropriate, they can be prepared with coatings such as enteric coatings or they can be formulated so as to provide controlled release of the active ingredient such as sustained or prolonged release according to methods well known in the art.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include solutions, emulsions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include sterile aqueous and nonaqueous injectable solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions as well as sterile powders to be reconstituted in sterile injectable solutions or dispersions prior to use. Depot injectable formulations are also contemplated as being within the scope of the present invention.<br>
Other suitable administration forms include suppositories, sprays, ointments, cremes, gels, inhalants, dermal patches, implants, etc.<br>
In an embodiment of the pharmaceutical composition, the compound of the invention administered in an amount of from about 0.001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day.<br><br>
Conveniently, the compounds of the invention are administered in a unit dosage form containing said compounds in an amount of about 0.01 to 100 mg. The total daily dose is usually in the range of about 0.05 - 500 mg.<br>
A typical oral dosage is in the range of from about 0,001 to about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably from about 0.01 to about 50 mg/kg body weight per day, administered in one or more dosages such as 1 to 3 dosages. The exact dosage will depend upon the frequency and mode of administration, the sex, age, weight and general condition of the subject treated, the nature and severity of the condition treated and any concomitant diseases to be treated and other factors evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form by methods known to those skilled in the art. A typical unit dosage form for oral administration one or more times per day such as 1 to 3 times per day may contain from 0.01 to about 1000 mg, preferably from about 0.05 to about 500 mg, and more preferred from about 0.5 mg to about 200 mg.<br>
For parenteral routes such as intravenous, intrathecal, intramuscular and similar administration, typically doses are in the order of about half the dose employed for oral administration.<br>
The compounds of this invention are generally utilized as the free substance or as a salt such as a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof. One example is an acid addition salt of a compound having the utility of a free base. When a compound of the invention contains a free base such salts are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of a free base of the invention with a chemical equivalent of an acid such as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. Representative examples are mentioned above.<br>
For parenteral administration, solutions of the compound of the invention in sterile aqueous solution, aqueous propylene glycol, aqueous vitamin E or sesame or peanut oil may be employed. Such aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with sufficient saline or glucose. The aqueous solutions are particularly suitable for intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal<br><br>
administration. The sterile aqueous media employed are all readily available by standard techniques known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solution and various organic solvents. Examples of solid carriers are lactose, terra alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, talc, gelatine, agar, pectin, acacia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and lower alkyl ethers of cellulose. Examples of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut oil, olive oil, phospho lipids, fatty acids, fatty acid amines, polyoxyethylene and water. Similarly, the carrier or diluent may include any sustained release material known in the art, such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone or mixed with a wax. The pharmaceutical compositions formed by combining the compound of the invention and the pharmaceutical acceptable carriers are then readily administered in a variety of dosage forms suitable for the disclosed routes of administration. The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form by methods known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules or tablets, each containing a predetermined, amount of the active ingredient, and which may include a suitable excipient. Furthermore, the orally available formulations may be in the form of a powder or granules, a solution or suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or an oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion.<br>
If a solid carrier is used for oral administration, the preparation may be tablette. e.g. placed in a hard gelatine capsule in powder or pellet form or e.g. in the form of a troche or lozenge. The amount of solid carrier may vary but will usually be from about 25 mg to about 1 g.<br>
If a liquid carrier is used, the preparation may be in the form of a syrup, emulsion, soft gelatine capsule or sterile injectable liquid such as an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspension or solution.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of the invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art.<br><br>
For example; Tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting machine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Corn starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvants or additives usually used for such purposes such as colourings, flavourings, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients.<br>
Solutions for injections may be prepared by dissolving the active ingredient and possible additives in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to the desired volume, sterilising the solution and filling it in suitable ampoules or vials. Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity agents, preservatives, antioxidants, etc.<br>

Tissue preparation: male wistar rats (125-250 g) are sacrificed by decapitated and striatum<br>
quickly dissected out and placed in 40 vol (w/v) ice cold 0,40 M sucrose. The tissue is<br>
gently homogenised  (glass teflon homogeniser) and the  P2  fraction  is  obtained by<br>
centrifugation (1000 g, 10 minutes and 40000 g, 20 minutes, 4°C) and suspended in 560<br>
volumes of a modified Krebs-Ringer-phosphate buffer, pH 7,4.<br>
Tissue 0,25 mg/well(140|il) (original tissue) is mixed with test suspension. After 5 minutes<br>
pre-incubation 12.5 nM 3H-dopamine is added and the mixture is incubated for 5 minutes at<br>
RT.<br>
The incubation is terminated by filtering the samples under vacuum through Whatman GF/C<br>
filters with a wash of 1 ml buffer. The filters are dried and appropriate scintillation fluid<br>
(Optiphase Supermix) is added. After storage for 2 hours in the dark the content of<br>
radioactivity  is  determined  by  liquid  scintillation  counting.   Uptake   is  obtained  by<br>
subtracting the non-specific binding and passive transport measured in the presence of 100<br>
