CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority from U.S.<br>
Provisional Application Serial No. 60/408,783, filed<br>
September 6, 2002, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to l,3-diamino-2-<br>
hydroxypropane prodrug derivatives and to such compounds<br>
that are useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease<br>
and related diseases. More specifically, it relates to<br>
such compounds that are capable of yielding or<br>
generating, either in vitro or in vivo, compounds that<br>
inhibit beta-secretase, an enzyme that cleaves amyloid<br>
precursor protein to produce amyloid beta peptide (A<br>
beta), a major component of the amyloid plagues found in<br>
the brains of Alzheimer's sufferers.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Alzheimer's â€¢ disease (AD) is a progressive<br>
degenerative disease of the brain primarily associated<br>
with aging. Clinical presentation of AD i characterized<br>
by loss of memory, cognition, reasoning, judgment, and<br>
orientation. As the disease progresses, motor, sensory,<br>
and linguistic abilities are also affected until there is<br>
global impairment of multiple cognitive functions. These<br>
cognitive losses occur gradually, but typically lead to<br>
severe impairment and eventual death in the range of four<br>
to twelve years.<br>
Alzheimer's disease is characterized by two major<br>
pathologic observations in the brain: neurofibrillary<br>
tangles and beta amyloid (or neuritic) plaques, comprised<br>
predominantly of an aggregate of a peptide fragment know<br>
as A beta. Individuals with AD exhibit characteristic<br>
beta-amyloid deposits in the brain (beta amyloid plaques)<br>
and in cerebral blood vessels (beta amyloid angiopathy)<br>
as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Neurofibrillary<br>
tangles occur not only in Alzheimer's disease but also in<br>
other dementia-inducing disorders. On autopsy, large<br>
numbers of these lesions are generally found in areas of<br>
the human brain important for memory and cognition.<br>
Smaller numbers of these lesions in a more<br>
restricted anatomical distribution are found in the<br>
brains of most aged humans who do not have clinical AD.<br>
Amyloidogenic plaques and vascular amyloid angiopathy<br>
also characterize the brains of individuals with Trisomy<br>
21 (Down's Syndrome), Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with<br>
Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type (HCHWA-D) , and other<br>
neurodegenerative disorders. Beta-amyloid is a defining<br>
feature of AD, now believed to be a causative precurscr<br>
or factor in the development of disease. Deposition of A<br>
beta in areas of the brain responsible for cognitive<br>
activities is a major factor in the development of AC.<br>
Beta-amyloid plaques are predominantly composed of<br>
amyloid beta peptide (A beta, also sometimes designated<br>
betaA4). A beta peptide is derived by proteolysis of the<br>
amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is comprised of 39-42<br>
amino acids. Several proteases called secretases are<br>
involved in the processing of APP.<br>
Cleavage of APP at the N-terminus of the A beta<br>
peptide by beta-secretase and at the C-terminus by one or<br>
more gamma-secretases constitutes the beta-amyloidogenic<br>
pathway, i.e. the pathway by which A beta is formed.<br>
Cleavage of APP by alpha-secretase produces alpha-sAPP, a<br>
secreted form of APP that does not result in beta-amyloid<br>
plaque formation. This alternate pathway precludes the<br>
formation of A beta peptide. A description of the<br>
proteolytic processing fragments of APP is found, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,441,870; 5,721,130; and<br>
5,942,400.<br>
An aspartyl protease has been identified as the<br>
enzyme responsible for processing of APP at the beta-<br>
secretase cleavage site. The beta-secretase enzyme has<br>
been disclosed using varied nomenclature, including BACE,<br>
Asp, and Memapsin. See, for example, Sinha et al., 1999,<br>
Nature 402:537-554 (p501) and published PCT application<br>
WO00/17369.<br>
Several lines of evidence indicate that progressive<br>
cerebral deposition of beta-amyloid peptide (A beta)<br>
plays a seminal role in the pathogenesis of AD and can<br>
precede cognitive symptoms by years or decades. See, for<br>
example, Selkoe, 19.91, Neuron 6:487. Release of A beta<br>
from neuronal cells grown in culture and the presence of<br>
A beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of both normal<br>
individuals and AD patients has been demonstrated. See,<br>
for example, Seubert et al., 1992, Nature 359:325-327.<br>
It has been proposed that A beta peptide accumulates<br>
as a result of APP processing by beta-secretase, thus<br>
inhibition of this enzyme's activity is desirable for the<br>
treatment of AD. In vivo processing of APP at the beta-<br>
secretase cleavage site is thought to be a rate-limiting<br>
step in A beta production, and is thus a therapeutic<br>
target for the treatment of AD. See for example,<br>
Sabbagh, M., et al., 1997, Alz. Dis. Rev. 3, 1-19.<br>
BACEl knockout mice fail to produce A beta, and<br>
present a normal phenotype. When crossed with transgenic<br>
mice that over express APP, the progeny show reduced<br>
amounts of A beta in brain extracts as compared with<br>
control animals (Luo et al., 2001 Nature Neuroscience<br>
4:231-232). This evidence further supports the proposal<br>
that inhibition of beta-secretase activity and reduction<br>
of A beta in the brain provides a therapeutic method for<br>
the treatment of AD and other beta amyloid disorders.<br>
At present there are no effective treatments for<br>
halting, preventing, or reversing the progression cf<br>
Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, there is an urgent need<br>
for pharmaceutical agents capable of slowing the<br>
progression of Alzheimer's disease and/or preventing it<br>
in the first place.<br>
Compounds that are effective inhibitors of beta-<br>
secretase, that inhibit beta-secretase-mediated cleavage<br>
of APP, that are effective inhibitors of A beta<br>
production, and/or are effective to reduce amyloid beta<br>
deposits or plaques, are needed for the treatment and<br>
prevention of disease characterized by amyloid beta<br>
deposits or plaques, such as AD.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As noted above, the invention provides compounds of<br>
formulae (AA) , (I) and (X) that are useful in the<br>
treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease. These<br>
compounds can be viewed as prodrugs of the active<br>
compounds of Formula Y since they generate the activs<br>
compound both in vivo and in vitro.<br>
The compounds of formula AA, I and X undergo acyl<br>
group migration of the RN group when in contact with<br>
water, as depicted in Scheme I. The migration associated<br>
with compounds of formula (I) is referred to herein as<br>
"N-acyl migration." The migration associated with<br>
compounds of formula (X) is referred to herein as wO-acyl<br>
migration."<br>
The migrations depicted in SCHEME 1 can occur either<br>
in vitro or in vivo and occur when the compounds are<br>
contacted with aqueous media, including water itself.<br>
The aqueous medium can be neutral, acidic or basic. It<br>
is preferred that the media have a pH of about 2 to abou~<br>
10, more preferably, about 3 to about 7. The amount of<br>
water required for the migration is not critical. A<br>
catalytic amount of aqueous media will suffice to cause<br>
the migration. Aqueous buffer solutions as well as<br>
gastric fluid are satisfactory media for the migration to<br>
occur.<br>
The products of the rearrangements of the compounds<br>
of formula AA, formula I and/or formula X are the<br>
compounds of formula (Y) . The substituents Ri, R2, R3, Rn<br>
and Rc in the compounds (Y) are as defined above fo:r<br>
compounds of formula (I).<br>

prepare the compounds of the invention are set forth<br>
below.<br>
A general process to prepare the compounds of<br>
formula I and X is set forth in SCHEME A. The chemistry<br>
is straight forward and in summary involves the steps of<br>
N-protecting the amino acid (A) starting material to<br>
produce the corresponding protected amino acid (II),<br>
reaction of the protected amino acid (II) with<br>
diazomethane followed by work-up to add a carbon atom to<br>
produce the corresponding protected compound (III),<br>
reduction of the protected halide to the corresponding<br>
alcohol (IV), formation of the corresponding epoxide (V),<br>
opening of the epoxide (V) with a C-terminal amine, RC-NH2<br>
(VI) to produce the corresponding protected alcohol<br>
(VII).<br>
Compounds of formula (I) can be prepared by reacting<br>
protected alcohol (VII) with an amide forming agent such<br>
as, for example, (Rn-)20 or Rjj-X or Rjj-OH (IX) to produce<br>
.alcohol (IA) . Alcohol (IA) then has the nitrogen<br>
protecting group removed to produce the corresponding<br>
compounds of formula (I).<br>
Compounds of formula (X) can be prepared by further<br>
N-protecting alcohol (VII) to form the diprotected<br>
alcohol (XB). Diprotected alcohol (XB) is reacted with<br>
an amide forming agent such as, for example, (Rn-)20 or<br>
RN-X or RN-OH (IX) to produce compound (XA). Compound<br>
(XA) then has the nitrogen protecting groups removed to<br>
produce the corresponding compounds of formula (X).<br>
One skilled in the art will appreciate that these<br>
are all known reactions in organic chemistry. A chemist<br>
s.&gt;illed in the art, knowing the chemical structure of the<br>
compounds (AA) , (I) and (X) of the invention would be<br>
able to prepare them by known methods from known starting<br>
materials without any additional information. The<br>
explanation below therefore is not necessary but. is<br>
deemed helpful to those skilled in the art who desire to<br>
make the compounds of the invention.<br>
The backbone of the intermediate (VII) , from which<br>
the compounds of formula (AA), (I) and (X) can be readily<br>
prepared, can be considered a hydroxyethylcLmine moiety, -<br>
NH-CH(R)-CH(OH)-. Such backbones can be prepared by<br>
methods disclosed in the literature and known to those<br>
skilled in the art. For example, J. Med. Chem., 36, 288-<br>
291 (1993), Tetrahedron Letters, 28, 5569-5572 (1987), J.<br>
Med. Chem., 38, 581-584 (1995) and Tetrahedron Letters,<br>
38, 619-620 (1997) and WO 02/02506 all disclose processes<br>
to prepare hydroxyethylamine type compounds and/or their<br>
intermediates.<br>
SCHEME A sets forth a general method used in the<br>
invention to prepare the appropriately substituted amines<br>
I and X. The compounds of the invention are prepared by<br>
starting with the corresponding amino acid (A) . The<br>
amino acids (A) are known to those skilled in the art or<br>
can be readily prepared by methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art. The compounds of the invention have<br>
at least two chiral centers, which give 2 sets of<br>
diastereomers, each of which is racemic for a total of at<br>
least four stereoisomers. While biologically active end<br>
products result from all stereoisomeres, the (S,R)<br>
configuration is preferred. The first of these chiral<br>
centers (the carbon carrying R.x) derives from the amino<br>
acid starting material (A) . It is preferred to<br>
commercially obtain or produce the desired enantiomer<br>
rather than produce an enantiomerically impure mixture<br>
and then have to separate out the desired enantiomer.<br>
Thus it is preferred to start the process with<br>
enantiomerically pure (S) -amino acid (A) of the same<br>
configuration as that of the desired X product.<br>
In Scheme A, the protection of free amine (A) to<br>
produce the (S)-protected amino acid (II) is depicted.<br>
Amino protecting groups are known to those skilled in the<br>
art, as discussed below. See for example, "Protecting<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and sons, New<br>
York, N.Y., 1981, Chapter 7,- "Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Chemistry", Plenum Press, New York, N.Y., 1973,<br>
Chapter 2. The function of the amino protecting group is<br>
to protect the free amino functionality (-NH2) during<br>
subsequent reactions on the (S)-amino acid (A) which<br>
would not proceed either because the amino group would<br>
react and be functionalized in a way that is inconsistent<br>
with its need to be free for subsequent reactions or the<br>
free amino group would interfere in the reaction. When<br>
the amino protecting group is no longer needed, it is<br>
removed by methods known to those skilled in the art. By<br>
definition the amino protecting group must be readily<br>
removable as is known to those skilled in the art by<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. Suitable amino<br>
PROTECTING GROUPS are discussed below.<br>
The (S)-protected amino acid (II) is transformed to<br>
the corresponding (S)-protected compound (III) by two<br>
different methods depending on nature of R2 and R3.<br>
R2 and R3 can be the same or different. It is<br>
preferred that R2 and R3 both be -H. If R2 and R3 are not<br>
the same, an additional chiral or stereogenic center is<br>
added to the molecule. To produce compounds of formula<br>
(III) where R2 and R3 are both -H, the (S)-protected arnino<br>
acid (II) is reacted with diazomethane, as is known to<br>
those skilled in the art, followed by reaction with a<br>
compound of the formula H-Xx to produce the (S) -protected<br>
compound. (Ill). Xi includes -Cl, -Br, -I, -O-tosylate, -<br>
O-mesylate, -O-nosylate and -O-brosylate. It is<br>
preferred that -Xi be -Br or -Cl. Suitable reaction<br>
conditions include running the reaction in Â¦ inert<br>
solvents, such as but not limited to ether,<br>
tetrahydrofuran and the like. The reactions from the<br>
(S)-protected amino acid (II) to the (S)-protected<br>
compound (III) are carried out for a period of time<br>
between 10 minutes and 1 day and at temperatures ranging<br>
from about -78Â° to about 20-25Â°. â€¢ It is preferred to<br>
conduct the reactions for a period of time between 1-4<br>
hours and at temperatures between -30Â° to -10Â°. This<br>
process adds one methylene group.<br>
Alternatively, the (S)-protected compounds of<br>
formula (III) can be prepared by first converting the<br>
(S) -protected amino acid (II) to a corresponding methyl<br>
or ethyl ester, according to methods established in the<br>
art, followed by treatment with a reagent of formula Xx-<br>
C(R2) (R3)-Xi and a strong metal base. The base serves to<br>
affect a halogen-metal exchange, where the -Xi undergoing<br>
exchange is a halogen selected from chlorine, bromine or<br>
iodine. The nucleophilic addition to the ester<br>
derivative gives directly the (S)-protected compound<br>
(III). Suitable bases include, but are not limited to<br>
the alkyllithiums including, for example, sec-<br>
butyllithium, n-butyllithium, and t-butyllithium. The<br>
reactions are preferably conducted at low temperature,<br>
such as -78Â°. Suitable reaction conditions include<br>
running the reaction in inert solvents, such as but not<br>
limited to, ether, tetrahydrofuran and the like. Where R2<br>
and R3 are both hydrogen, then examples of Xi-C(R2) (R3) -Xx<br>
include dibromomethane, diiodomethane, chloroiodomethane,<br>
bromoiodomethane and bromochloromethane. One skilled in<br>
the art. knows the preferred conditions required to<br>
conduct this reaction. Furthermore, if R2 and/or R3 are<br>
not -H, then by the addition of -C(R2) (R3) -Xi to esters of<br>
the (S)-protected amino acid (II) to produce the (S) -<br>
protected compound (III), an additional chiral center<br>
will be incorporated into the product, provided that R2<br>
and R3 are' not the same.<br>
The (S)-protected compound (III) is then reduced by<br>
means known to those skilled in the art for reduction of<br>
a ketone to the corresponding secondary alcohol affording<br>
the corresponding alcohol (IV) . The means and reaction<br>
conditions for reducing the (S)-protected compound (III)<br>
to the corresponding alcohol (IV) include, for example,<br>
sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, borane,<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride, and lithium aluminium<br>
hydride. Sodium borohydride is the preferred reducing<br>
agent. The reductions are carried out for a period of<br>
time between 1 hour and 3 days at temperatures ranging<br>
from -78Â° to elevated temperature up to the reflux point<br>
of the solvent employed. It is preferred to conduct the<br>
reduction between -78Â° and 0Â°. If borane is used, it may<br>
be employed as a complex, for example, borane-methyl<br>
sulfide complex, borane-piperidine complex, or bora.ne-<br>
tetrahydrofuran complex. The preferred combination of<br>
reducing agents and reaction conditions needed are known<br>
to those skilled in the art, see for example, Larock,<br>
R.C. in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH<br>
Publishers, 1989. The reduction of the (S)-protected<br>
compound (III) to the corresponding alcohol (IV) produces<br>
the second chiral center (third chiral center if R2 and R3<br>
are not the same). The reduction of the (S)-protected<br>
compound (III) produces a mixture of enantiomers at the<br>
second center, {S, R/S)-alcohol (IV). This enantiomeric<br>
mixture is then separated by means known to those skilled<br>
in the art such as selective low-temperature<br>
recrystallization or chromatÂ©graphic separation, for<br>
example by HPLC, employing commercially available chiral<br>
columns. The enantiomer that is used in the remainder of<br>
the process of SCHEME A is the (S,S) -alcohol (IV) since<br>
this enantiomer will give the desired (S,R)-substituted<br>
compound I or X.<br>
The (S, S)-alcohol (IV) is transformed to the<br>
corresponding epoxide (V) by means known to those skilled<br>
in the art. The stereochemistry of the (S)-(IV) center<br>
is maintained in forming the epoxide (V) . A preferred<br>
means is by reaction with base, for example, but not<br>
limited to, hydroxide ion generated from sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the<br>
like. Reaction conditions include the use of C]_-Cg<br>
alcohol solvents; ethanol is preferred. A common co-<br>
solvent, such as for example, ethyl acetate may also be<br>
employed. Reactions are conducted at. temperatures<br>
ranging from -45Â° up to the reflux temperature of the<br>
alcohol employed; preferred temperature ranges are<br>
between -20Â° and 40Â°.<br>
An alternative, and preferable process for preparing<br>
the epoxide (V) when Ri is 3,5-dif luorokenzyl, is set<br>
forth in SCHEME D. The first step of the process is to<br>
protect the free amino group of the (S) -amino acid (A)<br>
with an amino protecting group, PROTECTING GROUP, as<br>
previously discussed to produce the (S)-protected amino<br>
acid (II).<br>
In the alternative process, the (S)-protected arnino<br>
acid (A) is transformed to the corresponding (S) -<br>
protected ester (XVII) in one of a number of ways. One<br>
method involves the use of lithium hydroxide. Using<br>
lithium hydroxide, the (S)-protected amino acid (A) and<br>
the lithium hydroxide are mixed and cooled to from about<br>
-20Â° to about 10Â°. Next a methylating agent, selected<br>
from the group consisting of dimethylsulfate, methyl<br>
iodide and methyl triflate, is added. It is more<br>
preferred that the methylating agent is dimethylsulfcite.<br>
This is followed by heating to from about 20Â° to about<br>
50Â°.<br>
Alternatively, the (S)-protected amino acid (A) is<br>
contacted with a weak base such as bicarbonate or<br>
preferably carbonate. This is followed by addition of<br>
the methylating agent. Heat is not necessary but car. be<br>
used to facilitate the reaction. The carbonate method is<br>
known to those skilled in the art. For those (S)-<br>
protected esters (XVII) where ZÂ± is not methyl, one<br>
skilled in the art knowing the chemical structure would<br>
know how to prepare the desired compounds from known<br>
starting materials. In one known method the (S)-<br>
protected amino acid (A) is contacted with an activating<br>
agent, such as DCC, followed by addition of the<br>
appropriate alcohol, Zi-OH. This method is operable when<br>
Zi is Ci-C4 alkyl (optionally substituted) , -CH2-CH=CH;: or<br>
phenyl (optionally substituted).<br>
SCHEME E sets forth an alternative process for1 the<br>
preparation of the ester (II). In the process of SCHEME<br>
E, the aldehyde (XX), which is known to those skilled in<br>
the art, is reacted with the phosphorous compound (XXI) ,<br>
where X3 is a good leaving group, to produce the olefin<br>
(XXII). The phosphorous compounds (XXI) are known to<br>
those skilled in the art. It is preferred that X3 is Ci-<br>
C3 alkyl; it is more preferred that X3 is Ci alkyl. The<br>
aldehyde (XX) and the phosphate (XXI) are combined in an<br>
organic solvent then cooled to about 0Â°. A base such as<br>
DBU or TMG is added and the contents of the reaction<br>
mixture are warmed to about 20-25Â° and stirred until the<br>
reaction is complete. Once the reaction is complete, it<br>
is preferred to separate the E- and Z-olefin isomers<br>
(XXII). The separation is done by methods known to those<br>
skilled in the art, such as by silica gel chromatography.<br>
Next the olefin (XXII) is hydrogenated with a suitable<br>
hydrogenation catalyst to obtain the desired ester (II).<br>
Some hydrogenation reactions will give racemic ester<br>
(II) . The desired stereochemistry of the ester (II) is<br>
(S)-, and therefore it is preferable to use the Z-olefin<br>
(XXII) with a hydrogenation catalyst. I- is preferred<br>
that the hydrogenation catalyst is a compound of the<br>
formula [Rh(diene)L]+X"<br>
where Rh is rhodium;<br>
where diene is cyclootediene and nonbornadiene;<br>
where L is DIPMAP, MeDuPhos, EtDuPhos. Binaphane, f-<br>
Binaphane, Me-KetalPhos, Me-f-KetalPhos, BINAP, DIOP,<br>
BPPFA, BPPM, CHIRAPHOS, PROPHOS, NORPHOS, CYCLOPHOS,<br>
BDPP, DEGPHOS, PNNP and where X" is C1O4', BF4", CF3-SO3",<br>
Cl", Br", PF6" and SbF6". It is preferred that the<br>
hydrogenation catalyst be either DIPMAP or EtDuPhos.<br>
Suitable solvents include polar solvents such as<br>
alcohols, preferably C1-C5 alcohols and THF, more<br>
preferably methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and THF. The<br>
chiral hydrogenation is performed in a temperature range<br>
of from about -20Â° to about reflux. It is preferred that<br>
the reaction be performed in the temperature range from<br>
about 0Â° to about room temperature (25Â°) . The chiral<br>
hydrogenation is performed under a pressure of from about<br>
one atmosphere to about 100 psig; it is more preferred<br>
that the chiral hydrogenation be performed under a<br>
pressure of from about 10 psig to about 40 psig.<br>
The (S)-protected ester (II) is then transformed to<br>
the corresponding (S)-protected ketone (III; by reaction<br>
with a slight excess of a compound of the formula CH2C1X2<br>
where X2 is -Br and -I in one of two different ways. In<br>
one process, no exogenous nucleophile is used. That<br>
process requires (1) the presence of three or more<br>
equivalents of strong base which has a pKb of greater<br>
than about 30 followed by (2) adding acid. The other<br>
process requires (1) the presence of about 2 to about 2.5<br>
equivalents of strong base which has a pKb of greater than<br>
about 30, (2) contacting the mixture of step (1) with<br>
about 1 to about 1.5 equivalents of an exogenous<br>
nucleophile and (3) adding acid. Suitable strong bases<br>
are those which has a pKb of greater than about 30. It is<br>
preferred that the strong base be selected from the group<br>
consisting of LDA, LiHMDS and KHMDS; it is nore preferred<br>
that the strong base be LDA. Suitable acids are those,<br>
which have a pka of less than about 10. It is preferred<br>
the acid be selected from the group consisting of acetic,<br>
sulfuric, hydrochloric, citric, phosphoric and benzoic<br>
acids; it is more preferred that the acid be acetic acid.<br>
The preferred solvent for the process is THF. The<br>
reaction can be performed in the temperature range from<br>
about -80Â° to about -50Â°; it is preferred to perform the<br>
reaction in the temperature range of from about -75Â° to<br>
about -65Â°. Suitable nucleophiles include alkyl lithium,<br>
aryl lithium, alkyl-Grignard and aryl-Grignsird reagents.<br>
It is preferred that the nucleophile be selected from the<br>
group consisting of phenyl lithium, n-butyl lithium,<br>
methyl magnesium bromide, methyl magnesium chloride,<br>
phenyl magnesium bromide, phenyl magnesium chloride; it<br>
is more preferred that the nucleophile be n-butyl<br>
lithium.<br>
The (S)-protected ketone (III) is then reduced to<br>
the corresponding (S)-alcohol (IV) by means known to<br>
those skilled in the art for reduction of a ketone to the<br>
corresponding secondary alcohol. The means and reaction<br>
conditions for reducing the (S)-protected compound (III)<br>
to the corresponding alcohol (IV) include, for example,<br>
sodium borohydride, lithium borohydride, borane,<br>
diisobutylaluminum hydride, zinc borohydride and lithium<br>
aluminium hydride. Sodium borohydride is the preferred<br>
reducing agent. The reductions are carried out for . a<br>
period of time between about 1 hour and about 3 days at<br>
temperatures ranging from about -78Â° to elevated<br>
temperature up to the reflux point of the solvent<br>
employed. It is preferred to conduct the reduction<br>
between about -78Â° and about 0Â°. If borane is used, it<br>
may be employed as a complex, for example, borane-methyl<br>
sulfide complex, borane-piperidine complex, or borane-<br>
tetrahydrofuran complex. The preferred combination of<br>
reducing agents and reaction conditions needed are known<br>
to those skilled in the art, see for example, Larock,<br>
R.C. in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH<br>
Publishers, 1989. The reduction of the (S)-protected<br>
compound (III) to the corresponding alcohol (IV) produces<br>
a second chiral center. The reduction of the (S) -<br>
protected compound (III) produces a mixture of<br>
diastereomers at the second center, (S, R/S)-alcohol<br>
(IV). This diastereomeric mixture is then separated by<br>
means known to those skilled in the art such as selective<br>
low-temperature recrystallization or chromatographic<br>
Separation, most preferably by recrystallization or by<br>
employing commercially available chiral columns. The<br>
diastereomer that is used in the remainder of the process<br>
of SCHEME A is the (S,S)-alcohol (IV) since this<br>
stereochemistry will give the desired epoxide (V).<br>
The alcohol (IV) is transformed to the corresponding<br>
epoxide (V) by means known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The stereochemistry of the (S)-(IV) center is maintained<br>
in forming the epoxide (V) . A preferred means is by<br>
reaction with base, for example, but not limited to,<br>
hydroxide ion generated from sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, lithium hydroxide and the like. Reaction<br>
conditions include the use of C^-Cg alcohol solvents;<br>
ethanol is preferred. A common co-solvent, such as for<br>
example, ethyl acetate may also be employed. Reactions<br>
are conducted at temperatures ranging from about -45Â° up<br>
to the reflux temperature of the alcohol employed;<br>
preferred temperature ranges are between about -20Â° and<br>
about 40Â°.<br>
The epoxide (V) is then reacted with the<br>
appropriately substituted C-terminal amine, RC-NH2 (VI) by<br>
means known to those skilled in the art which opens the<br>
epoxide to produce the desired corresponding<br>
enantiomerically pure (S,R)-protected alcohol (VII). The<br>
substituted C-terminal amines, RC-NH2 (VI) of this<br>
invention are commercially available or cire known to<br>
those skilled in the art and can be readily prepared from<br>
known compounds. It is preferred that when Re is phenyl,<br>
it is substituted in the 3-position or 3,5-positions.<br>
Suitable reaction conditions for opening the epoxide<br>
(V) include running the reaction in a wide range of<br>
common and inert solvents. C^-Cg alcohol solvents sire<br>
preferred and isopropyl alcohol most preferred. The<br>
reactions can be run at temperatures ranging from 20-25Â°<br>
up to the reflux temperature of the alcohol employed.<br>
The preferred temperature range for conducting the<br>
reaction is between 50Â° up to the reflux temperature of<br>
the alcohol employed. When the substituted C-terminal<br>
amine (VI) is a l-amino-3,5-cis-dimethyl<br>
cyclohexyldicarboxylate it is preferably prepared as<br>
follows. To dimethyl-5-isophthalate in acetic acid and<br>
methanol, is added rhodium in alumina in a high-pressure<br>
bottle. The bottle is saturated with hydrogen at 55 psi<br>
and shaken for one week of time. The mixture is then<br>
filtered through a thick layer of celite cake and rinsed<br>
with methanol three times, the solvents are removed under<br>
reduced pressure (with heat) to give a concentrate. The<br>
concentrate is triturated with ether and filtered again<br>
to give the desired C-terminal amine (VI). When the<br>
substituted C-terminal amine (VI) is l-amino-3,5-cis-<br>
dimethoxy cyclohexane it is preferably following the<br>
general procedure above and making non-critical<br>
variations but starting with 3,5-dimethoxyaniline.<br>
When the substituted C-terminal amine . (VI) is an<br>
aminomethyl group where the substituent on the methyl<br>
group is an aryl group, for example NH2-CH2-aryl, is not<br>
commercially available it is preferably prepared as<br>
follows. A suitable starting material is the<br>
(appropriately substituted) aralkyl compound. The first<br>
step is bromination of the alkyl substituent via methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art, see for example R.C.<br>
Larock in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH<br>
Publishers, 1989, p. 313. Next the alkyl halide is<br>
reacted with azide to produce the aryl-(alkyl)-azide.<br>
Last the azide is reduced to the corresponding amine by<br>
hydrogen/catalyst to give the C-terminal amine (VI) of<br>
formula NH2-CH2-Rc-aryi.<br>
SCHEME B discloses an alternative process for<br>
production of the enantiomerically pure (S,R)-protected<br>
alcohol (VII) from the (S)-protected compound (III). In<br>
the alternative process, the (S)-protected compound (III)<br>
is first reacted with the appropriately substituted C-<br>
terminal amine RC-NH2 (VI) using the preferred conditions<br>
described above to produce the corresponding (S) -<br>
protected ketone (XI) which is then reduced using the<br>
preferred conditions described above to produce the<br>
corresponding (S,R)-protected alcohol (VII).<br>
SCHEME C discloses another alternative process for<br>
production of enantiomerically pure (S,R)-protected<br>
alcohol (VII) but this time from the epoxide (V). In the<br>
process of SCHEME C, the epoxide (V) is reacted with<br>
azide to produce the corresponding enantiomerically pure<br>
(S,R)-protected azide (XII). Conditions to conduct the<br>
azide mediated epoxide opening are known to those skilled<br>
in the art, see for example, J. March, Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons Publishers,<br>
1985, p. 380. Next, the (S,R)-protected azide (XII) is<br>
reduced to the corresponding protected amine (XIII) by<br>
methods known to those skilled in the art. Preferred<br>
reducing conditions to reduce the (S,R)-protected azide<br>
(XII) in the presence of a t-butoxycarbonyl N-protecting<br>
group include catalytic hydrogenation, the conditions for<br>
which are known to those skilled in the art. Alternative<br>
reducing conditions which may be used to avoid N-<br>
deprotection with protecting groups other than t-<br>
butoxycarbonyl are known to those skilled in the art, see<br>
for example, R.C. Larock in Comprehensive Organic<br>
Transformations, VCH Publishers, 1989, p. 409. Last, the<br>
(S,R)-amine (XIII) is transformed to the corresponding<br>
protected alcohol (VII) by nitrogen alkylation with a<br>
compound of the formula Rc-X3. X3 is an appropriate<br>
leaving group, such as but not limited to, -Cl, -Br, -I,<br>
-O-mesylate, -O-tosylate, O-triflate, etc. X3 may also be<br>
an aldehyde; the corresponding coupling with (XIII) via<br>
the known reductive amination procedure gives the<br>
protected (S,R)-alcohol (VII).<br>
In the formation of compounds of foirmula (I) , the<br>
protected alcohol (VII) is reacted with an appropriately<br>
substituted amide forming agent (IX) such as, for<br>
example, an anhydride, acyl halide, or acid of the<br>
formulas (Rn)2O or RHX or RnOH (IX) respectively, by means<br>
known to those skilled in the art to produce the<br>
corresponding (S,R)-substituted amine (IA). Nitrogen<br>
acylation conditions for reaction of the alcohol (VII)<br>
with an amide forming agent (IX) to produce the<br>
corresponding compound (IA) are known to those skilled in<br>
the art and can be found, for example, in R.c. Larocx in<br>
Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers,<br>
1989, p. 981, 979, and 972. The (S, R)-protected amne<br>
(IA) is deprotected to the corresponding compounds (I) by<br>
means known to those skilled in the art for removal of<br>
amine protecting group. Suitable means for removal of<br>
the amine protecting group depend on the nature of the<br>
protecting group. Those skilled in the art, knowing the<br>
nature of a specific protecting group, know which reagent<br>
is preferable for its removal. For example, it is<br>
preferred to remove the preferred protecting group, BOC,<br>
by dissolving the (S,R)-protected amine (IA) in a<br>
trifluoroacetic acid/dichloromethane (1/1) mixture. When<br>
complete, the solvents are removed under reduced pressure<br>
to give the corresponding (S,R)-amine (I) (as the<br>
corresponding salt, i.e. trifluoroacetic acid salt) which<br>
is used without further purification. However, if<br>
desired, the (S,R)-amine (I) can be purified further by<br>
means known to those skilled in the art, such as for<br>
example,, recrystallization. Further, if the non-salt<br>
form is desired that also can be obtained by means known<br>
to those skilled in the art, such as for example,<br>
preparing the free base amine via treatment of the salt<br>
with mild basic conditions. Additional BOC deprotection<br>
conditions and deprotection conditions for other<br>
protecting groups can be found in T.W. Green and P.G.M.<br>
Wuts in "Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, John<br>

In the formation of compounds of formula (X) ,<br>
alcohol (VII) is further protected as described above to<br>
form the diprotectred compound (XB). Compound (XB) is<br>
then reacted with an appropriately substituted e.mide<br>
forming agent (IX) to form compound (XA) , as described<br>
above for compound (IA). Deprotection of (XA) to<br>
compunds ' (X) is conducted as described for the<br>
transformation of compound (IA) to compounds (I).<br>
The protection of amines is conducted, where<br>
appropriate, by methods known to those skilled in the<br>
art. Amino protecting groups are known to those skilled<br>
in the art. See for example, "Protecting Groups in<br>
Organic Synthesis", John Wiley and sons, New York, K.Y.,<br>

The compounds of the invention may contain geometric<br>
or optical isomers as well as tautomers. Thus, the<br>
invention includes all tautomers and pure geometric<br>
isomers, such as the E. and Z geometric iscmers, as well<br>
as mixtures thereof. Further, the invention includes<br>
pure enantiomers and Â¦diastereomers as well as mixtures<br>
thereof, including racemic mixtures. The individual<br>
geometric isomers, enantiomers or diastereomers may be<br>
prepared or isolated by methods known to those skilled in<br>
the art, including but not limited toÂ¦ chiral<br>
chromatography; preparing diastereomers, separating the<br>
diastereomers and converting the diastereomers into<br>
enantiomers through the use of a chiral resolving agent.<br>
Compounds of the invention with designated<br>
stereochemistry can be included in mixtures, including<br>
racemic mixtures, with other enantiomers, diastereomers,<br>

invention with designated stereochemistry are present in<br>
these mixtures in excess of 99 percent.<br>
The invention encompasses pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (AA), (I)<br>
and (X) . Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are preferred<br>
over the corresponding amines of formula (AA), (I) or (X)<br>
since they produce compounds which are more water<br>
soluble, stable and/or more crystalline.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are any salt which<br>
retains the activity of the parent compound and does not<br>
impart any deleterious or undesirable â‚¬&gt;ffect on the<br>
subject to whom it is administered and in the context in<br>
which it is administered. Pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include salts of both inorganic and organic acids.<br>

The invention provides compounds, compositions,<br>
kits, and methods for inhibiting beta-secretase enzyme<br>
activity and A beta peptide production. Inhibition of<br>
beta-secretase enzyme activity halts or reduces the<br>
production of A beta from APP and reduces or eliminates<br>
the formation of beta-amyloid deposits in the brain.<br>
Methods of the Invention<br>
The compounds of the invention, and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts thereof, are useful for treating humans<br>
or animals suffering from a condition characterized by a<br>
pathological form of beta-amyloid peptide, such as beta-<br>
amyloid plagues, and for helping to prevent or delay the<br>
onset of such a condition.<br>
As used herein, the term "treating" means that the<br>
compounds of the invention can be used in humans with at<br>
least a'tentative diagnosis of disease. The compoundiS of<br>
the invention will delay or slow the progression of the<br>
disease thereby giving the individual a more useful life<br>
span.<br>
The term "preventing" means that the compounds of<br>
the invention are useful when administered to a patient<br>
who has not been diagnosed as possibly having the disease<br>
at the time of administration, but who would normally be<br>
expected to develop the disease or be at increased risk<br>
for the disease. The compounds of the invention will<br>
slow the development of disease symptoms, delay the onset<br>
of the disease, or prevent the individual from developing<br>
the disease at all. Preventing also includes<br>
administration of the compounds of the invention to those<br>
individuals thought to be predisposed to the disease due<br>
to age, familial history, genetic ' or chromosomal<br>
abnormalities, and/or due to the presence of one or more<br>
biological markers for the disease, such as a known<br>
genetic mutation of APP or APP cleavage products in brain<br>
tissues or fluids.<br>
In treating or preventing the above diseases, the<br>
compounds of the invention are administered in a<br>
therapeutically effective amount. The therapeutically<br>
effective amount will vary depending on the particular<br>
compound used and the route of administration, as is<br>
known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In treating a patient displaying any of the<br>
diagnosed above conditions a physician may administer a<br>
compound of the invention immediately and continue<br>
administration indefinitely, as needed. In treating<br>
patients who are not diagnosed as having Alzheimer's<br>
disease, but who are believed to be at substantial risk<br>
for Alzheimer's disease, the physician should preferably<br>
start treatment when the patient first experiences early<br>
pre-Alzheimer's symptoms such as, memory or cognitive<br>
problems associated with aging. In addition, there are<br>
some patients who may be determined to be at risk for<br>
developing Alzheimer's through the detection of a genetic<br>
marker such as APOE4 or other biological indicators that<br>
are predictive for Alzheimer's disease. In these<br>
situations, even though the patient does not have<br>
symptoms of the disease, administration of the compounds<br>
of the invention may be started before symptoms appear,<br>
and treatment may be continued indefinitely to prevent or.<br>
delay the onset of the disease.<br>
Dosage Forms and Amounts<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
orally, parenterally, (IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo SQ),<br>
sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally,<br>
topically, or rectally. Dosage forms known to those of<br>
skill in the art are suitable for delivery of the<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
Compositions are provided that contain<br>
therapeutically effective amounts of the compounds of the<br>
invention. The compounds are preferably formulated into<br>
suitable pharmaceutical preparations such as tablets,<br>
capsules, or elixirs for oral administration or in<br>
sterile solutions or suspensions for parenteral<br>
administration. Typically the compounds described above<br>
are formulated into pharmaceutical compositions using<br>
techniques and procedures well known in the art.<br>
About 1 to 500 mg of a compound or mixture of<br>
compounds of the invention or a physiologically<br>
acceptable salt or ester is compounded with a<br>
physiologically acceptable vehicle, carrier, excipient,<br>
binder, preservative, stabilizer, flavor, etc., in a unit<br>
dosage form as called for by accepted pharmaceutical<br>
practice. The amount of active substance in those<br>
compositions or preparations is such that a suitable<br>
dosage in the range indicated is obtained. The<br>
compositions are preferably formulated in a unit dosage<br>
form, each dosage containing from about 2 to about 100<br>
mg, more preferably about 10 to about 30 mg of the active<br>
ingredient. The term nunit dosage from" refers to<br>
physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for<br>
human subjects and other mammals, each unit containing a<br>
predetermined quantity of active material calculated to<br>
produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association<br>
with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient.<br>
To prepare compositions, one or more compounds of<br>
the invention are mixed with a suitable pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. Upon mixing or addition of the<br>
compound(s) , the resulting mixture may be a solution,<br>
suspension, emulsion, or the like. Liposomal suspensions<br>
may also be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers. These may be prepared according to methods<br>
known to those skilled, in the art. The form of the<br>
resulting mixture depends upon a number of factors,<br>
including the intended mode of administration and the<br>
solubility of the compound in the selected carrier or<br>
vehicle. The effective concentration is sufficient for<br>
lessening or ameliorating at least one symptom of the<br>
disease, disorder, or condition treated and may be<br>
empirically determined.<br>
Pharmaceutical carriers or vehicles suitable for<br>
administration of the compounds provided herein include<br>
any such carriers known to those skilled in the art to be<br>
suitable for the particular mode of administration. In<br>
addition, the active materials can also be mixed with<br>
other active materials that do not impair the desired<br>
action, or with materials that supplement the desired<br>
action, or have another action. The compounds may be<br>
formulated as the sole pharmaceutically active ingredient<br>
in the composition or may be combined with other active<br>
ingredients.<br>
Where the compounds exhibit insufficient solubility,<br>
methods for solubilizing may be used. Such methods are<br>
known and include, but are not limited to, using<br>
cosolvents such as dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), using<br>
surfactants such as TweenÂ®, and dissolution in aqueous<br>
sodium bicarbonate. Derivatives of the compounds, such<br>
as salts or prodrugs may also be used in formulating<br>
effective pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The concentration of the compound is effective for<br>
delivery of an amount upon administration that lessens or<br>
ameliorates at least one symptom of the disorder for<br>
which the compound is administered. Typically, the<br>
compositions are formulated for single dosage<br>
administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be prepared with<br>
carriers that protect them against rapid elimination from<br>
the body, such as time-release formulations or coatings.<br>
Such carriers include controlled release formulations,<br>
such as, but not limited to, microencapsulated delivery<br>
systems. The active compound is included in the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in an amount<br>
sufficient to exert a therapeutically useful effect in<br>
the absence of undesirable side effects 0:1 the patient<br>
treated. The therapeutically effective concentration may<br>
be determined empirically by testing the compounds in<br>
known in vitro and in vivo model systems for the treated<br>
disorder.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the invention can<br>
be enclosed in multiple or single dose containers. The<br>
enclosed compounds and compositions can be provided in<br>
kits, for example, including component parts that can be<br>
assembled for use. For example, a compound inhibitor in<br>
lyophilized form and a suitable diluent may be provided<br>
as separated components for combination prior to use. A<br>
kit may include a compound inhibitor and a second<br>
therapeutic agent for co-administration. The inhibitor<br>
and second therapeutic agent may be provided as separate<br>
component parts. A kit may include a plurality of<br>
containers, each container holding one or more unit dose<br>
of the compound of the invention. The containers are<br>
preferably adapted for the desired mode of<br>
administration, including, but not limited to tablets,<br>
gel capsules, sustained-release capsules, and the like<br>
for oral administration; depot products, pre-filled<br>
syringes, ampoules, vials, and the like for parenteral<br>
administration; and patches, medipads, creams, and the<br>
like for topical administration.<br>
The concentration of active compound in the drug<br>
composition will depend on absorption, inactivation, and<br>
excretion rates of the active compound, the dosage<br>
schedule, and amount administered as well as other<br>
factors known to those of skill in the art.<br>
The active ingredient may be administered at once,<br>
or may be divided into a number of smaller doses to be<br>
administered at intervals of time. It is imderstood that<br>
the precise dosage and duration of treatment is a<br>
function of the disease being treated and may be<br>
determined empirically using known testing protocoLs or<br>
by extrapolation from in vivo or in vitro test data. It<br>
is to be noted that concentrations and dosage values may<br>
also vary with the severity of the condition to be<br>
alleviated. It is to be further understood that for any<br>
particular subject, specific dosage regimens should be<br>
adjusted over time according to the individual need and<br>
the professional judgment of the person administering or<br>
supervising the administration of the compositions, and<br>
that the concentration ranges set forth herein are<br>
exemplary only and are not intended to limit the scope or<br>
practice of the claimed compositions.<br>
If oral administration is desired, the compound<br>
should be provided in a composition that protects it from<br>
the acidic environment of the stomach. For example, the<br>
composition can be formulated in an enteric coating that<br>
maintains its integrity in the stomach and releases the<br>
active compound in the intestine. The composition may<br>
also be formulated in combination with an antacid or<br>
other such ingredient.<br>
Oral compositions will generally include an inert<br>
diluent or an edible carrier and may be compressed into<br>
tablets pr enclosed in gelatin capsules. For the purpose<br>
of oral therapeutic administration, the active compound<br>
or compounds can be incorporated with excipients and used<br>
in the form of tablets, capsules, or troches.<br>
Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents and adjuvant<br>
materials can be included as part of the composition.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, troches, and the like<br>
can contain any of the following ingredients or compounds<br>
of a similar nature: a binder such as, but not limited<br>
to, gum tragacanth, acacia, corn starch, or gelatin; an<br>
excipient such as microcrystalline cellulose, starch, or<br>
lactose; a disintegrating agent such as, but not limited<br>
to, alginic acid and corn starch; a lubricant such as,<br>
but not limited to, magnesium stearate; a gildant, such<br>
as, but not limited to, colloidal silicon dioxide; a<br>
sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; and a<br>
flavoring agent such as peppermint, methyl salicylate, or<br>
fruit flavoring.<br>
When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it can<br>
contain, in addition to material of the above type, a<br>
liquid carrier such as a fatty oil. In addition, dosage<br>
unit forms can contain various other materials, which<br>
modify the physical form of the dosage unit, for example,<br>
coatings of sugar and other enteric agents. The<br>
compounds can also be administered as a component of an<br>
elixir, suspension, syrup, wafer, chewing gum or the<br>
like. A syrup may contain, in addition to the active<br>
compounds, sucrose as a sweetening agent and certain<br>
preservatives, dyes and colorings, and flavors.<br>
The active materials can also be mixed with other<br>
active materials that do not impair the desired action,<br>
or with materials that supplement the desired action.<br>
Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral,<br>
intradermal, subcutaneous, or topical application can<br>
include any of the following components: a sterile<br>
diluent such as water for injection, saline solution,<br>
fixed oil, a naturally occurring vegetable oil such as<br>
sesame oil, coconut oil, peanut oil, cottonseed oil, and<br>
the like, or a synthetic fatty vehicle such as ethyl<br>
oleate, and the like, polyethylene glycol, glycerine,<br>
propylene glycol, or other synthetic solvent;<br>
antimicrobial agents such as benzyl alcohol and methyl<br>
parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid and sodium<br>
bisulfite; chelating agents such as<br>
ethylenediatninetetraacetic acid (EDTA); buffers such as<br>
acetates, citrates, and phosphates; and agents for the<br>
adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride and<br>
dextrose. Parenteral preparations can be enclosed in<br>
ampoules, disposable syringes, or multiple dose vials<br>
made of glass, plastic, or other suitable material.<br>
Buffers, preservatives, antioxidants, and the like can be<br>
incorporated as required.<br>
Where administered intravenously, suitable carriers<br>
include physiological saline, phosphate buffered saline<br>
(PBS), and solutions containing thickening and<br>
solubilizing agents such as glucose, polyethylene glycol,<br>
polypropyleneglycol, and mixtures thereof. Liposomal<br>
suspensions including tissue-targeted liposomes may also<br>
be suitable as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers.<br>
These may be prepared according to methods known for<br>
example, as described in U.S. Patent Mo. 4,522,811.<br>
The active compounds may be prepared with carriers<br>
that protect the compound against rapid elimination from<br>
the body, such as time-release formulations or coatings.<br>
Such carriers include controlled release formulations,<br>
such as, but not limited to, implants and<br>
microencapsulated delivery systems, and biodegradable,<br>
biocompatible polymers such as collagen, sthylene vinyl<br>
acetate, polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid,<br>
polyorthoesters, polylactic acid, and the like. Methods<br>
for preparation of such formulations are known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
orally, parenterally (IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ, and depo-;3Q) ,<br>
sublingually, intranasally (inhalation), intrathecally,<br>
topically, or rectally. Dosage forms known to those<br>
skilled in the art are suitable for delivery of the<br>
compounds of the invention.<br>
Compounds of the invention may be administered<br>
enterally or parenterally. When administered orally,<br>
compounds of the invention can be administered in usual<br>
dosage forms for oral administration as is well known to<br>
those skilled in the art. These dosage forms include the<br>
usual solid unit dosage forms of tablets and capsules as<br>
well as liquid dosage forms such as solutions,<br>
suspensions, and elixirs. When the solid dosage forms<br>
are used, it is preferred that they be of the sustained<br>
release type so that the compounds of the invention need<br>
to be administered only once or twice daily.<br>
The oral dosage forms are administered to the<br>
patient 1, 2, 3, or 4 times daily. It is preferred that<br>
the compounds of the invention be administered either<br>
three or fewer times, more preferably once or twice<br>
daily. Hence, it is preferred that the compounds of the<br>
invention be administered in oral dosage form. It is<br>
preferred that whatever oral dosage form is used, that it<br>
be designed so aB to protect the compounds of the<br>
invention from the acidic environment of the stomach.<br>
Enteric coated tablets are well known to those skilled in<br>
the art. In addition, capsules filled with small spheres<br>
each coated to protect from the acidic stomach, are also<br>
well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
When administered orally, an administered amount<br>
therapeutically effective to inhibit beta-secretase<br>
activity, to inhibit A beta production, to inhibit A beta<br>
deposition, or to treat or prevent AD is from about 0.1<br>
mg/day to about 1,000 mg/day. It is preferred that the<br>
oral dosage is from about 1 mg/day to about 100 mg/day.<br>
It is more preferred that the oral dosage is from about 5<br>
mg/day to about 50 mg/day. It is understood that while a<br>
patient may be started at one dose, that dose may be<br>
varied over time as the patient's condition changes.<br>
Compounds of the invention may also be<br>
advantageously delivered in a nano crystal dispersion<br>
formulation. Preparation of such formulations is<br>
described, for example, in U.S. Patent 5,145,684. Nano<br>
crystalline dispersions of HIV protease inhibitors and<br>
their method of use are described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,045,829. The nano crystalline formulations typically<br>
afford greater bioavailability of drug compounds.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
parenterally, for example, by IV, IM, depo-IM, SC, or<br>
depo-SC. ' When administered parenterally, a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of about 0.5 to about<br>
100 mg/day, preferably from about 5 to about 50 mg daily<br>
should be delivered. When a depot formulation is used<br>
for injection once a month or once every two weeks, the<br>
dose should be about 0.5 mg/day to about 50 mg/day, or a<br>
monthly dose of from about 15 mg to about 1,500 mg. In<br>
part because of the forgetfulness of the patients with<br>
Alzheimer's disease, it is preferred that the parenteral<br>
dosage form be a depo formulation.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
sublingually. When given sublingually, the compounds of<br>
the invention should be given one to four times daily in<br>
the amounts described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
intranasally. When given by this route, the appropriate<br>
dosage forms are a nasal spray or dry powder, as is known<br>
to those skilled in the art. The dosage of the compounds<br>
of the invention for intranasal administration is the<br>
amount described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
intrathecally. When given by this route the appropriate<br>
dosage form can be a parenteral dosage form as is known<br>
to those skilled in the art. The dosage of the compounds<br>
of the invention for intrathecal administration is the<br>
amount described above for IM administration.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
topically. When given by this route, the appropriate<br>
dosage form is a cream, ointment, or patch. Because of<br>
the amount of the compounds of the invention to be<br>
administered, the patch is preferred. When administered<br>
topically, the dosage is from about 0.5 mg/day to about<br>
200 mg/day. Because the amount that can be delivered by<br>
a patch is limited, two or more patches may be used. The<br>
number and size of the patch is not important, what is<br>
important is that a therapeutically effective amount of<br>
the compounds of the invention be delivered as is known<br>
to those skilled in the art.- The compounds of the<br>
invention can be administered rectally by suppository as<br>
is known to those skilled in the art. When administered<br>
by suppository, the therapeutically effective amount is<br>
from about 0.5 mg to about 500 tng.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be administered<br>
by implants as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
When administering a compound of the invention by<br>
implant, the therapeutically effective amount is the<br>
amount described above for depot administration.<br>
Given a particular compound of the invention and a<br>
desired dosage form, one skilled in the art would know<br>
how to prepare and administer the appropriate dosage<br>
form.<br>
The compounds of the invention are used in the same<br>
manner, by the same routes of administration, using the<br>
same pharmaceutical dosage forms, and at the same dosing<br>
schedule as described above, for preventing disease: or<br>
treating patients with MCI (mild cognitive impairment)<br>
and preventing or delaying the onset of Alzheimer's<br>
disease in those who would progress from MCI to AD, for<br>
treating or preventing Down's syndrome, for treating<br>
humans who have Hereditary Cerebral Hemorrhage with<br>
Amyloidosis of the Dutch-Type, for treating cerebral<br>
amyloid angiopathy and preventing its potential<br>
consequences, i;e. single and recurrent lobar<br>
hemorrhages, for treating other degenerative dementias,<br>
including dementias of mixed vascular and degenerative<br>
origin, dementia associated with Parkinson's disease,<br>
dementia associated with progressive supranuclear palsy,<br>
dementia associated with cortical basal degeneration, and<br>
diffuse Lewy body type of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used in<br>
combination, with each other or with other therapeutic<br>
agents or approaches used to treat or prevent the<br>
conditions listed above. Such agents or approaches<br>
include: acetylcholine esterase inhibitors such as<br>
tacrine (tetrahydroaminoacridine, marketed as COGNEXÂ®),<br>
donepezil hydrochloride, (marketed as AriceptÂ® and<br>
rivastigmine (marketed as ExelonÂ®); gatnma-secretase<br>
inhibitors; anti-inflammatory agents such as<br>
cyclooxygenase II inhibitors; anti-oxidants such as<br>
Vitamin E and ginkolides; immunological approaches, such<br>
as, for example, immunization with A beta peptide or<br>
administration of anti-A beta peptide antibodies?<br>
statins; and direct or indirect neurotropic agents such<br>
as CerebrolysinÂ®, AIT-082 (Erailieu, 2000, Arch. Neuxol.<br>
57:454), and other neurotropic agents of the future.<br>
In addition, the compounds of formula (AA) , (I) or<br>
(X) can also be used with inhibitors of P-glycoprotein<br>
(P-gp) . P-gp inhibitors and the use of such compounds<br>
are known to those skilled in the art. See for example,<br>
Cancer Research, 53, 4595-4602 (1993), Clin. Cancer Res.,<br>
2, 7-12 (1996), Cancer Research, 56, 4171-4179 (1996),<br>
International Publications WO99/64001 and WO01/10387.<br>
The important thing is that the blood level of the P-gp<br>
inhibitor be such that it exerts its effect in inhibiting<br>
P-gp from decreasing brain blood levels of the compounds<br>
of formula (A) . To that end the P-gp inhibitor and the<br>
compounds of formula (A) can be administered at the same<br>
time, by the same or different route of administration,<br>
or at different times. The important thing is not the<br>
time of administration but having an effective blood<br>
level of the P-gp inhibitor.<br>
Suitable P-gp inhibitors include cyclosporin A,<br>
verapamil, tamoxifen, quinidine, Vitamin E-TGPS,<br>
ritonavir, megestrol acetate, progesterone, rapamycin,<br>
10,ll-methanodibenzosuberane, phenothiazines, acridine<br>
derivatives such as GF120918, FK506, VX-710, LY335979,<br>
PSC-833, GF-102,918 and other steroids. It is to be<br>
understood that additional agents will be found that have<br>
the same function and therefore achieve the same outcome;<br>
such compounds are also considered to be useful.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be administered orally,<br>
parenterally, (IV, IM, IM-depo, SQ, SQ-depo), topically,<br>
sublingually, rectally, intranasally, intrathecally and<br>
by implant.<br>
The therapeutically effective amount of the P-gp<br>
inhibitors is from about 0.1 to about 300 mg/kg/day,<br>
preferably about 0.1 to about 150 mg/kg daily. It is<br>
understood that while a patient may be started on one<br>
dose, that dose may have to be varied over time as the<br>
patient's condition changes.<br>
When administered orally, the P-gp inhibitors can be<br>
administered in usual dosage forms for oral<br>
administration as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
These dosage forms include the usual solid unit dosage<br>
forms of tablets and capsules as well as liquid dosage<br>
forms such as solutions, suspensions and elixirs. When<br>
the solid dosage forms are used, it is preferred that<br>
they be of the sustained release type so that the P-gp<br>
inhibitors need to be administered only once or twice<br>
daily. The oral dosage forms are administered to the<br>
patient one thru four times daily. It is preferred that<br>
the P-gp inhibitors be administered either three or fewer<br>
times a day, more preferably once or twice daily. Hence,<br>
it is preferred that the P-gp inhibitors be administered<br>
in solid dosage form and further it is preferred that the<br>
solid dosage form be a sustained release form which<br>
permits once or twice daily dosing. It is preferred that<br>
what ever dosage form is used, that it be designed so as<br>
to protect the P-gp inhibitors from the acidic<br>
environment of the stomach. Enteric coated tablets are<br>
well known to those skilled in the art. In addition,<br>
capsules filled with small spheres each coated to protect<br>
from the acidic stomach, are also well known to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
In addition, the P-gp inhibitors can be administered<br>
parenterally. When administered parenterally they can be<br>
administered IV, IM, depo-IM, SQ or depo-SQ.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given sublingually. Vlhen<br>
given sublingually, the P-gp inhibitors should be given<br>
one thru four times daily in the same amount as for IM<br>
administration.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given intranasally. When<br>
given by this route of administration, the appropriate<br>
dosage forms are a nasal spray or dry powder as is known<br>
to those skilled in the art. The dosage of the P-gp<br>
inhibitors for intranasal administration is the same as<br>
for IM administration.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given intrathecally.<br>
When given by this route of administration the<br>
appropriate dosage form can be a parenteral dosage form<br>
as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be given topically. When<br>
given by this route of administration, the appropriate<br>
dosage form is a cream, ointment or patch. Because of<br>
the amount of the P-gp inhibitors needed to be<br>
administered the patch is preferred. However, the amount<br>
that can be delivered by a patch is limited. Therefore,<br>
two or more patches may be required. The number and size<br>
of the patch is not important, what is important is that<br>
a therapeutically effective amount of the P-gp inhibitors<br>
be delivered as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be administered rectally by<br>
suppository as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The P-gp inhibitors can be administered by implants<br>
as is known to those skilled in the art.<br>
There is nothing novel about the route of<br>
administration nor the dosage forms for administering the<br>
P-gp inhibitors. Given a particular P-gp inhibitor, and<br>
a desired dosage form, one skilled in the art would know<br>
how to prepare the appropriate dosage form for the P-gp<br>
inhibitor.<br>
It should be apparent to one skilled in the art that<br>
the exact dosage and frequency of administration will<br>
depend on the particular compounds of the invention<br>
administered, the particular condition being treated, the<br>
severity of the condition being treated, the age, weight,<br>
general physical condition of the particular patient, and<br>
other medication the individual may be taking as is well<br>
known to administering physicians who are skilled in this<br>
art.<br>
Inhibition of APP Cleavage<br>
The compounds of the invention inhibit cleavage of<br>
APP between Met595 and Asp596 numbered for the APP695<br>
isoform, or a mutant thereof, or at a corresponding site<br>
of a different isoform, such as APP751 or APP770, or a<br>
mutant thereof (sometimes referred to as the "beta<br>
secretase site") . While not wishing to be bound by a<br>
particular theory, inhibition of beta-secretase activity<br>
is thought to inhibit production of beta amyloid peptide<br>
(A beta). Inhibitory activity is demonstrated in one of<br>
a variety of inhibition assays, whereby cleavage of an<br>
APP substrate in the presence of a beta-secretase enzyme<br>
is analyzed in the presence of the inhibitory compound,<br>
under conditions normally sufficient to result in<br>
cleavage at the beta-secretase cleavage site. Reduction<br>
of APP cleavage at the beta-secretase cleavage site<br>
compared with an untreated or inactive control is<br>
correlated with inhibitory activity. Assay systems that<br>
can be used to demonstrate efficacy of the compound<br>
inhibitors of the invention are known. Representative<br>
assay systems are described, for example, in U.S. Patents<br>
No. 5,942,400, 5,744,346, as well as in the Examples<br>
below.<br>
The enzymatic activity of beta-secretase and the<br>
production of A beta can be analyzed in vitro or in vivo,<br>
using natural, mutated, and/or, synthetic APP substrates,<br>
natural, mutated, and/or synthetic enzyme, and the test<br>
compound. The analysis may involve primary or secondary<br>
cells expressing native, mutant, and/or synthetic APP and<br>
enzyme, animal models expressing native APP and enzyme,<br>
or may utilize transgenic animal models expressing the<br>
substrate and enzyme. Detection of enzymatic activity<br>
can be by analysis of one or more of the cleavage<br>
products, for example, by immunoassay, fluorometric or<br>
chromogenic assay, HPLC, or other means of detection.<br>
Inhibitory compounds are determined as those having the<br>
ability to decrease the amount of beta-secretase cleavage<br>
product produced in comparison to a control, where beta-<br>
secretase mediated cleavage in the reaction system is<br>
observed and measured in the absence of inhibitory<br>
compounds.<br>
Beta-Secretase<br>
Various forms of beta-secretase enzyme are known,<br>
and are available and useful for assay of enzyme activity<br>
and inhibition of enzyme activity. These include native,<br>
recombinant, and synthetic forms of the enzyme. Human<br>
beta-secretase is known as Beta Site APP Cleaving Enzyme<br>
(BACE), Asp2, and memapsin 2, and has been characterized,<br>
for example, in U.S. Patent No. 5,744,346 and published<br>
PCT patent applications WO98/22597, WO00/03819,<br>
WO01/23533, and WO00/17369, as well as in literature<br>
publications (Hussain et al., 1999, Mol. Cell. Neurosci.<br>
14:419-427; Vassar et al., 1999, Science 286:735-741;<br>
Yan et al., 1999, .Nature 402:533-537; Sinha et al. ,<br>
1999, Nature 40:537-540; and Lin et al., 2000, PNAS USA<br>
97:1456-1460). Synthetic forms of the enzyme have also<br>
been described (W098/22597 and WOOO/17369). Beta-<br>
secretase can be extracted and purified from human brain<br>
tissue and can be produced in cells, for example<br>
mammalian cells expressing recombinant enzyme.<br>
Preferred rearranged compounds are effective to<br>
inhibit about 50% of beta-secretase enzymatic activity at<br>
a concentration of less than 50 micromolar, preferably at<br>
a concentration of 10 micromolar or less, more preferably<br>
1 micromolar or less, and most preferably 10 nanomolar or<br>
less.<br>
APP Substrate<br>
Assays that demonstrate inhibition of beta-<br>
secretase-mediated cleavage of APP can utilize any of the<br>
known forms of APP, including the 695 amino acid "normal"<br>
isotype described by Kang et al., 1987, .Nature 325:733-6,<br>
the 770 amino acid isotype described by Kitaguchi et.<br>
al., 1981, Nature 331:530-532, and variants such as the<br>
Swedish Mutation (KM670-1NL) (APP-SW) , the London<br>
Mutation (V7176F), and others. See, for example, U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,766,846 and also Hardy, 1992, Nature Genet.<br>
1:233-234, for a review of known variant mutations.<br>
Additional useful substrates include the dibasic amino<br>
acid modification, APP-KK disclosed, for example, in WO<br>
00/17369, fragments of APP, and synthetic peptides<br>
containing the beta-secretase cleavage site, wild type<br>
(WT) or mutated form, e.g., SW, as described, for<br>
example, in U.S. Patent No 5,942,400 and WO00/03819.<br>
The APP substrate contains the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site of APP (KM-DA or NL-DA) for example, a<br>
complete APP peptide or variant, an APP fragment, a<br>
.recombinant or synthetic APP, or a fusion peptide.<br>
Preferably, the fusion peptide includes the beta-<br>
secretase cleavage site fused to a peptide having a<br>
moiety useful for enzymatic assay, for example, having<br>
isolation and/or detection properties. A useful moiety<br>
may be an antigenic epitope for antibody binding, a label<br>
or other detection moiety, a binding substrate, and the<br>
like.<br>
Antibodies<br>
Products characteristic of APP cleavage can be<br>
measured by immunoassay using various antibodies/ as<br>
described, for example, in Pirttila et al., 1999, Neuro.<br>
Lett. 249:21-4, and in U.S. Patent No. 5,612,486. Useful<br>
antibodies to detect' A beta include, for example, the<br>
monoclonal antibody 6E10 (Senetek, St. Louis, MO) that<br>
specifically recognizes an epitope on amino acids 1-16 of<br>
the A beta peptide; antibodies 162 and 154 (New York<br>
State Institute for Basic Research, Staten Island, NY)<br>
that are specific for human A beta 1-40 and 1-42,<br>
respectively; and antibodies that recognize the junction<br>
region of beta-amyloid peptide, the site between residues<br>
16 and 17, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,593,846.<br>
' Antibodies raised against a synthetic peptide of residues<br>
591 to 596 of APP and SW192 antibody raised against 590-<br>
596 of the Swedish mutation are also useful in<br>
immunoassay of APP and its cleavage products, as<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,604,102 and 5,721,130.<br>
Assay Systems<br>
Assays for determining APP cleavage at the beta-<br>
secretase cleavage site are well known in the art.<br>
Exemplary assays, are described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 5,744,346 and 5,942,400, and described in the<br>
Examples below.<br>
Cell Free Assays<br>
Exemplary assays that can be used to demonstrate the<br>
inhibitory activity of the compounds of the invention are<br>
described, for example, in WO00/17369, WO 00/03819, and<br>
U.S. Patents No. 5,942,400 and 5,744,346. Such assays<br>
can be performed in cell-free incubations or in cellular<br>
incubations using cells expressing a beta-secretase and<br>
an APP substrate having a beta-secretase cleavage site.<br>
An APP substrate containing the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site of APP, for example, a complete APP or<br>
variant, an APP fragment, or a recombinant or synthetic<br>
APP substrate containing the atnino acid sequence: KM-DA<br>
or NL-DA, is incubated in the presence of beta-secretase<br>
enzyme, a fragment thereof, or a synthetic or recombinant<br>
polypeptide variant having beta-secretase activity and<br>
effective to cleave the beta-secretase cleavage site of<br>
APP, under incubatdon conditions suitable for the<br>
cleavage activity of the enzyme. Suitable substrates<br>
optionally include derivatives that may be fusion<br>
proteins or peptides that contain the substrate peptide<br>
and a modification useful to facilitate the purification<br>
or detection of the peptide or its beta-secretase<br>
cleavage products. Useful modifications include the<br>
insertion ' of a known antigenic epitope for antibody<br>
binding; the linking of a label or detectable moiety, the<br>
linking of a binding substrate, and the like.<br>
Suitable incubation conditions for a cell-free in<br>
vitro assay include, for example: approximately 200<br>
nanomolar to 10 micromolar substrate, approximately 10 to<br>
200 picomolar enzyme, and approximately 0.1 nanomolar to<br>
10 micromolar inhibitor compound, in aqueous solution, at<br>
an approximate pH of 4 -7, at approximately 37 degrees C,<br>
for a time period of approximately 10 minutes to 3 hours.<br>
These incubation conditions are exemplary only, and can<br>
be varied as required for the particular assay components<br>
and/or desired measurement system. Optimization of the<br>
incubation conditions for the particular assay components<br>
should account for the specific beta-secretase enzyme<br>
used and its pH optimum, any additional enzymes and/or<br>
markers that might be used in the assay, and the like.<br>
Such optimization is routine and will not require undue<br>
experimentation.<br>
One useful assay utilizes a fusion peptide having<br>
maltose binding protein (MBP) fused to the C-terminal 125<br>
amino acids of APP-SW. The MBP portion is captured on an<br>
assay substrate by anti-MBP capture antibody. Incuba~ion<br>
of the captured fusion protein in the presence of beta-<br>
secretase results in cleavage of the substrate at the<br>
beta-secretase cleavage site. Analysis of the cleavage<br>
activity can be, for example, by immunoassay of cleavage<br>
products. One such immunoassay detects a unique epitope<br>
exposed at the carboxy terminus of the cleaved fusion<br>
protein, for example, using the antibody SW192. 17his<br>
assay is described, for example, in U.S. Patent No<br>
5,942,400.<br>
Cellular Assay<br>
Numerous cell-based assays can be used to analyze<br>
beta-secretase activity and/or processing of APP to<br>
release A beta. Contact of an APP substrate with a beta-<br>
secretase enzyme within the cell and in the presence or<br>
absence of a compound inhibitor of the invention can be<br>
used to demonstrate beta-secretase inhibitory activity of<br>
the compound. Preferably, assay in the presence of a<br>
useful inhibitory compound provides at least about 30%,<br>
most preferably at least about 50% inhibition of the<br>
enzymatic activity, as compared with a non-inhibited<br>
control.<br>
In one embodiment, cells that naturally express<br>
beta-secretase are used. Alternatively, cells are<br>
modified to express a recombinant beta-secretase or<br>
synthetic variant enzyme as discussed above. The APP<br>
substrate may be added to the culture medium and is<br>
preferably expressed in the cells. Cells that naturally<br>
express APP, variant or mutant forms of APP, or cells<br>
transformed to express an isoform of APP, mutant or<br>
variant APP, recombinant or synthetic APP, APP fragment,<br>
or synthetic APP peptide or fusion protein containing the<br>
beta-secretase APP cleavage site can be used, provided<br>
that the expressed APP is permitted to contact the enzyme<br>
and enzymatic cleavage activity can be analyzed.<br>
Human cell lines that normally process A beta from<br>
APP provide a useful means to assay inhibitory activities<br>
of the compounds of the invention. Production and<br>
release of A beta and/or other cleavage products into the<br>
culture medium can be measured, for example by<br>
immunoassay, such as Western blot or enzyme-linked<br>
immunoassay (EIA) such as by ELISA.<br>
Cells expressing an APP substrate and an active<br>
beta-secretase can be incubated in the presence of a<br>
compound inhibitor to demonstrate inhibition of enzymatic<br>
activity as compared with a control. Activity of beta-<br>
secretase can be measured by analysis of one or more<br>
cleavage products of the APP substrate. For example,<br>
inhibition of beta-secretase activity against the<br>
substrate APP would be expected to. decrease release of<br>
specific beta-secretase induced APP cleavage products<br>
such as A beta.<br>
Although both neural and non-neural cells process<br>
and release A beta, levels of endogenous beta-secretase<br>
activity are low and often difficult to detect by EIA.<br>
The use of cell types known to have enhanced beta-<br>
secretase activity, enhanced processing of APP to A beta,<br>
and/or enhanced production of A beta are therefore<br>
preferred. For example, transfection of cells with the<br>
Swedish Mutant form of APP (APP-SW); with APP-KK; or with<br>
APP-SW-KK provides cells having enhanced beta-secretase<br>
amount of CTF99 fragments of APP in the cell lysates is<br>
reduced as compared with the control. The cleavage<br>
products of APP can be analyzed, for example, by immune<br>
reactions with specific antibodies, as discussed above.<br>
Preferred cells for analysis of ' beta-secretase<br>
activity include primary human neuronal cells, primary<br>
transgenic animal neuronal cells where the transgene is<br>
APP, and other cells such as those of a stable 293 cell<br>
line expressing APP, for example, APP-SW.<br>
In vivo Assays: Animal Models<br>
Various animal models can be used to analyze besta-<br>
secretase activity and /or processing of AP? to release A<br>
beta, as described above. For example, transgenic<br>
animals expressing APP substrate and beta-secretase<br>
enzyme can be used to demonstrate inhibitory activity of<br>
the compounds of the invention. Certain transgenic<br>
animal models have been described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent NOS.: 5,877,399; 5,612,486; 5,3 87,742;<br>
5,720,936; 5,850,003; 5,877,015,, and 5, 811, 633, and in<br>
Ganes et al., 1995, Nature 373:523. Preferred are<br>
animals that exhibit characteristics associated with the<br>
pathophysiology of AD. Administration of the compound<br>
inhibitors of the invention to the transgenic mice<br>
described herein provides an alternative method for<br>
activity and producing amounts of A beta that can be<br>
readily measured.<br>
In such assays, for example, the cells expressing<br>
APP and beta-secretase are incubated in a culture medium<br>
under conditions suitable for beta-secretase enzymatic<br>
activity at its cleavage site on the APP substrate. On<br>
exposure of the cells to the compound inhibitor, the<br>
amount of A beta released into the medium and/or the<br>
amount of CTF99 fragments of APP in the cell lysates is<br>
reduced as compared with the control. The cleavage<br>
products of APP can be analyzed, for example, by immune<br>
reactions with specific antibodies, as discussed above.<br>
Preferred cells for analysis of beta-secretase<br>
activity include primary human neuronal cells, primary<br>
transgenic animal neuronal cells where the transgene is<br>
APP, and other cells such as those of a stable 293 cell<br>
line expressing APP, for example, APP-SW.<br>
In vivo Assays: Animal Models<br>
Various animal models can be used to analyze beta-<br>
secretase activity and /or processing of APP to release A<br>
beta, as described above. For example, transgenic<br>
animals expressing APP substrate and beta-secretase<br>
enzyme can be used to demonstrate inhibitory activity of<br>
the compounds of the invention. Certain transgenic<br>
animal models have been described, for example, in U.S.<br>
Patent Nos.: 5,877,399; 5,612,486; 5,387,742;<br>
5,720,936; 5,850,003; 5,877,015,, and 5,811,633, and in<br>
Ganes et al., 1995, Nature 373:523. Preferred are<br>
animals that exhibit characteristics associated with the<br>
pathophysiology of AD. Administration of the compound<br>
inhibitors of the invention to the transgenic mice<br>
described herein provides an alternative method for<br>
demonstrating the inhibitory activity of the compounds.<br>
Administration of the compounds in a phairmaceutically<br>
effective carrier and via an administrative route that<br>
reaches the target tissue in an appropriate therapeutic<br>
amount is also preferred.<br>
Inhibition of beta-secretase mediated cleavage of<br>
APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site and of A ieta<br>
release can be analyzed in these animals by measure of<br>
cleavage fragments in the animal's body fluids such as<br>
cerebral fluid or tissues. Analysis of brain tissues for<br>
A beta deposits or plaques is preferred.<br>
On contacting an APP substrate with a beta-secretase<br>
enzyme in the presence of an inhibitory compound of the<br>
invention and under conditions sufficient to permit<br>
enzymatic mediated cleavage of APP and/or release of A<br>
beta from the substrate, the compounds of the invention<br>
are effective to reduce beta-secretase-mediated cleavage<br>
of APP at the beta-secretase cleavage site and/or<br>
effective to reduce released amounts of A beta. Where<br>
such contacting is the administration of the inhibitory<br>
compounds of the invention to an animal model, for<br>
example, as described above, the compounds are effective<br>
to reduce A beta deposition in brain tissues of the<br>
animal, and to reduce the number and/or size of beta<br>
amyloid plagues. Where such administration is to a human<br>
subject, the compounds are effective to inhibit or slow<br>
the progression of disease characterized by enhanced<br>
amounts of A beta, to slow the progression of AD in the,<br>
and/or to prevent onset or development of AD in a patient<br>
at risk for the disease.<br>
Unless defined otherwise, all scientific and<br>
technical terms used herein have the same meaning as<br>
commonly understood by one of skill in the art to which<br>
this invention belongs. All patents and publications<br>
referred to herein are hereby incorporated by reference<br>
for all purposes.<br>
Definitions<br>
The definitions and explanations below are for the<br>
terms as used throughout this entire document including<br>
both the specification and the claims.<br>
It should be noted that, as used in this<br>
specification and the appended claims, the singular forms<br>
"a," "an," and "the" include plural referents unless the<br>
content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example,<br>
reference to a composition containing "a compound"<br>
includes a mixture of two or more compounds. It should<br>
also be noted that the term "or" is generally employed in<br>
its sense including "and/or" unless the content cleeirly<br>
dictates otherwise.<br>
The symbol "-" in general represents a bond between<br>
two atoms in the chain. Thus CH3-O-CH2-CH(Ri) -CH3<br>
represents a 2-substituted-1-methoxypropane compound. In<br>
addition, the symbol "-" represents the point of<br>
attachment of the substituent to a compound. Thus for<br>
example aryl(Ci-Cs)alkyl- indicates an alkylaryl group,<br>
such as benzyl, attached to the compound at the alkyl<br>
moiety.<br>
Where multiple substituents are indicated as being<br>
attached to a structure, it is to be understood that the<br>
substituents can be the same or different. Thus for<br>
example "Rm optionally substituted with 1, 2 or 3 Rg<br>
groups" indicates that Rm is substituted with 1, 2, or 3<br>
Rq groups where the Rq groups can be the same or<br>
different.<br>
APP, amyloid precursor protein, is defined as any<br>
APP polypeptide, including APP variants, mutations, and<br>
isoforms, for example, as disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,766,846.<br>
A beta, amyloid beta peptide, is defined as any<br>
peptide resulting from beta-secretase mediated cleavage<br>
of APP, including peptides of 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43<br>
amino acids, and extending from the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site to amino acids 39, 40, 41, 42, or 43.<br>
Beta-secretase (BACE1, Asp2, Memapsin 2) is an<br>
aspartyl protease that mediates cleavage of APP at the<br>
amino-terminal edge of A beta. Human beta-secretase is<br>
described, for example, in WO00/17369.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable refers to those<br>
properties and/or substances that are acceptable to the<br>
patient from a pharmacological/toxicological point of<br>
view and to the manufacturing pharmaceutical chemist from<br>
a physical/chemical point of view regarding composition,<br>
formulation, stability and patient acceptance.<br>
A therapeutically effective amount is defined as an<br>
amount effective to reduce or lessen at least one symptom<br>
of the disease being treated or to reduce or delay onset<br>
of one or more clinical markers or symptoms of the<br>
disease.<br>
By "alkyl" and wCi-Cg alkyl" in the present invention<br>
is meant straight or branched chain alkyl groups having<br>
1-6 carbon atoms, such as, methyl, ethyl, propyl,<br>
isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, 2-<br>
pentyl, isopentyl, neopentyl, hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl,<br>
and 3-methylpentyl. It is understood that in cases where<br>
an alkyl chain of a substituent (e.g. of an alkyl, alkoxy<br>
or alkenyl group) is shorter or longer than 6 carbons, it<br>

PREPARATION 1 tert-Butyl (IS)-3-bromo-l-(3,5-<br>
difluorobenzyl)-2-oxopropylcarbamate (III)<br>
N-methyl-morpholine (5.83 Ml, 53 mmole, 1.05 eg.) is<br>
added to [23)-2- [ (tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]-3-(3,5-<br>
difluorophenyl)propanoic acid (II, 15 g, 50 mmole) in THF<br>
(100 mL) and the reaction is cooled to -78Â°. Isobutyl<br>
chloroformate (6.87 mL, 53 mmole, 1.05 eq.) is added<br>
rapidly. The cold bath is then removed and the mixture<br>
stirred for 1 hr. The reaction was monitored by TLC to<br>
insure completion of the reaction and the mixture is then<br>
filtered and washed with dry THF (50 ml) and kept cold in<br>
the filtered flask at -20Â°.<br>
In a ice-salt bath is placed a 50 0 ml graduate<br>
cylinder containing ether (200 mL) and aqueous potassium<br>
hydroxide (40%, 60 ml) . 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-<br>
nitrosoguanidine (5.6 g, 106 mmole, 2.1 eq.) is added<br>
slowly with stirring and temperature kept below zero<br>
degree. The mixture turned yellow and the bubbling<br>
lasted for 10 minutes. The stirring is stopped and<br>
without mixing the layers, the top diazomethane ethereal<br>
layer is transferred with non-ground tip pipette into the<br>
stirred mixed anhydride mixture at -20Â°. The reaction is<br>
monitored by TLC (ethyl acetate/hexane, 50/50; Rf = 0.69).<br>
After 1 hour nitrogen is then bubbled into the mixture.<br>
The solvent is removed under reduced pressure (with heat)<br>
and the mixture is partitioned between ether and water.<br>
The phases are separated, the organic phase is washed<br>
with bicarbonate, saline, dried over anhydrous sodium<br>
sulfate, filtered, and solvent removed under reduced<br>
pressure (with heat). The residue is dissolved in ether<br>
(100 mL) and hydrobromous acid (48%, 15 mL, 135 mmole,<br>
2.7 eq,) is added at -20Â°, the cold bath is removed and<br>
the mixture is stirred for another half hour. The<br>
reaction is monitored by TLC (ethyl acetate/hexane,<br>
50/50; Rf = 0.88]. The mixture is partitioned between<br>
ether and water, washed with bicarbonate, saline, dried<br>
over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered, and the solvent<br>
removed. The residue is recrystallized from ethanol to<br>
give the title compound, TLC (ethyl acetate/hexane,<br>
50/50) Rf = 0.88; MS (MH+) = 379.3<br>
PREPARATION 2 tert-Butyl (IS, 2S)-3-bromo-l-(3,5-<br>
difluorobenzyl)-2-hydroxypropylcarbamate (IV)<br>
Sodium borohydride (1.32 g, 34.9 mmole, 1.1 eq.) is<br>
added to tert-Butyl (IS)-3-bromo-l-(3,5-difluorobenzyl) -<br>
2-oxopropylcarbamate (III, PREPARATION 1, 12 g, 31.75<br>
mmole) dissolved in absolute alcohol (500 mL) -78Â°. The<br>
reaction mixture is stirred for 3 0 minutes and monitored<br>
by TLC (ethyl acetate/hexane, 20/80; Rf = 0.2). The<br>
mixture is quenched with water (10 mL) and the solvent<br>
removed under reduced pressure with heat (not exceeding<br>
30Â°) to dryness. The solid is partitioned between<br>
dichloromethane and water, washed with saline, dried over<br>
anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solvent is removed under<br>
reduced pressure to give the title compound, TLC (ethyl<br>
acetate/hexane, 20/80) Rf = 0.2; MS (MH+) = 381.2<br>
PREPARATION 3 tert-Butyl (IS) -2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-1-<br>
[(2S)-oxiranyl]ethylcarbamate (V)<br>

2-hydroxypropylcarbamate (IV, PREPARATION 2) is dissolved<br>
in absolute alcohol (150 mL) and ethyl acetate (100 mL)<br>
and potassium hydroxide (2.3 g, 34.9 mmole, l.leg.) in<br>
ethyl alcohol (85%, 5mL) is added at -20Â°. The cold bath<br>
is then removed and the mixture stirred for 30 minutes.<br>
The reaction is monitored by TLC (ethyl acetate/hexane,<br>
20/80) . When the reaction is complete, it is diluted<br>
with dichloromethane and extracted, washed with water,<br>
saline, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and the<br>
solvent removed under reduced pressure. The crude<br>
material is purified by flash chromatography on silica<br>
gel to give the title compound, TLC (ethyl<br>
acetate/hexane, 20/80) Rf = 0.3; MS (MH+) = 300.4.<br>

mmole) is mixed with isopropanol (145 ml) . The reaction<br>
flask is charged with 3-(trifluoromethyDbenzylamine.<br>
The reaction mixture is heated to reflux for 3 hours,<br>
HPLC analysis indicates complete disappearance of the<br>
epoxide. The reaction mixture is concentrated under<br>
reduced pressure and the residue is partitioned between<br>
ethyl acetate and aqueous hydrochloric acid. The orgamic<br>
phase is separated and washed with aqueous hydrochloric<br>
acid, bicarbonate, and saline then dried over sodium<br>
sulfate. Concentration under reduced pressure and<br>
recrystallization from hot hexane gives the title<br>
compound, MS (MH+) 475.<br>

REARRANGEMENT EXAMPLES<br>
The following examples illustrate the acyl group<br>
migration that takes place with compounds of the<br>
invention. These examples are for illustration purposes,<br>
and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
General Procedure:<br>
A compound of formula (I) OR (X) (5 mg) is<br>
dissolved in DMSO-d6 (50 0 |iL) and either pH 4 buffer<br>
solution (500 nL, potassium hydrogen phthalate buffer) or<br>
pH 7 buffer solution (500 uL, sodium and potassium<br>
phosphate buffer) is added. The sample is then heated to<br>
40Â°C. The 0-acyl or N-acyl to N-terminal N-acyl<br>
migration is monitored by observing the change in<br>
chemical shift for the aromatic fluorines using 19F-NMR.<br>
(Fluorine shifts associated with the desired migration<br>
were confirmed by spiking with authentic analogue). The<br>
sample is analyzed by 19F-NMR at approxiamately 0, 1.5, 3,<br>
24, 48, and 144 hours. The amount of O-acyl pro-drug, N-<br>
acyl pro-drug, and desired migration product at each time<br>
point are assigned by integrating the corresponding NMR<br>
signal.<br><br>

hydrochloride (PREPARATION 7, 5 mg) is dissolved in DMSO-<br>
d6 (500 uL) and pH 4 buffer solution (500 nL, potassium<br>
hydrogen phthalate buffer) is added. The sample is then<br>
heated to 40Â°C. The N-acyl to N-terminal N-acyl<br>
migration is monitored by observing the change in<br>
chemical shift for the aromatic fluorines using 19F-NMR.<br>
(Fluorine shifts for the desired migration product in the<br>
presence of buffer was confirmed by spiking with<br>
authentic migration product, N1-((IS,2R)-1-(3,5-<br>
difluorobenzyl)-2-hydroxy-3-{[3-<br>
(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]amino}propyl)-5-(1, 3-oxazol-2-<br>
yl) -N3,N3-dipropylisophthalamide.) NMR data is collected<br>
at 0, 1, 3, 25, 48, 96, and 144 hours. The amount of N-<br>
acyl pro-drug and desired migration product present at<br>
each time point is assigned by integrating the<br>
corresponding NMR signal. No migration to O-acyl pro-<br>
drug was observed using this method and was confirmed by<br>
spiking with authentic compound.<br>
The following examples illustrate the solution acyl<br>
group migration of compounds of the formulae (I) and (X)<br>
as observed by 19F NMR spectroscopy. Data were collected<br>
as described in Example 1, above.<br>

BIOLOGY EXAMPLES<br>
Example A<br>
Enzyme Inhibition Assay<br>
The rearranged compounds of the invention are<br>
analyzed for inhibitory activity by use of the MBP-C125<br>
assay. This assay determines the relative inhibition of<br>
beta-secretase cleavage of a model APP substrate, MBP-<br>
C125SW, by the compounds assayed as compared with an<br>
untreated control. A detailed description of the assay<br>
parameters can be found, for example, in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,942,400. Briefly, the substrate is a fusion peptide<br>
formed of maltose binding protein (MBP) and the carboxy<br>
terminal 125 amino acids of APP-SW, the Swedish mutation.<br>
Th*, jbeta-secretase enzyme is derived from human brain<br>
tissue as described in Sinha et al, 1999, Nature 40:537-<br>
540) or recombinantly produced as the full-length enzyme<br>
(amino acids 1-501), and can be prepared, for example,<br>
from 293 cells expressing the recombinant cDNA, as<br>
described in WO00/47618.<br>
Inhibition of the enzyme is analyzed, for example,<br>
by immunoassay of the enzyme's cleavage products. One<br>
exemplary ELISA uses an anti-MBP capture antibody that, is<br>
deposited on precoated and blocked 96-well high binding<br>
plates, followed by incubation with diluted enzyme<br>
reaction supernatant, incubation with a specific reporter<br>
antibody, for example, biotinylated anti-SW192 reporter<br>
antibody, and further incubation with<br>
streptavidin/alkaline phosphatase. In the assay,<br>
cleavage of the intact MBP-C125SW fusion protein results<br>
in the generation of a truncated amino-terminal fragment,<br>
exposing a new SW-192 antibody-positive epitope at the<br>
carboxy terminus. Detection is effected by a fluorescent<br>
substrate signal on cleavage by the phosphatase. ELISA<br>
only detects cleavage following Leu 596 at the<br>
substrate's APP-SW 751 mutation site.<br>
Specific Assay Procedure:<br>
Compounds are diluted in a 1:1 dilution series to a<br>
six-point concentration curve (two wells per<br>
concentration) in one 96-plate row per compound tested.<br>
Each of the test compounds is prepared in DMSO to make up<br>
a 10 millimolar stock solution. The stock solution is<br>
serially diluted in DMSO to obtain a final compound<br>
concentration of 200 micromolar at the high point of a 6-<br>
point dilution curve. Ten (10) microliters of each<br>
dilution is added to each of two wells on row C of a<br>
corresponding V-bottom plate to which 190 microliters of<br>
52 millimolar NaOAc, 7.9% DMSO, pH 4.5 are pre-added.<br>
The NaOAc diluted compound plate is spun down to pellet<br>
precipitant and 20 microliters/well is transferred to a<br>
corresponding flat-bottom plate to which 30 microliters<br>
of ice-cold enzyme-substrate mixture (2.5 microliters<br>
MBP-C125SW substrate, 0.03 microliters enzyme and 24.5<br>
microliters ice cold 0.09% TX100 per 30 microliters} is<br>
added. The final reaction mixture of 200 micromolar<br>
compound at the highest curve point is in 5% DMSO, 20<br>
millimolar NaOAc, 0.0S% TX100, at pH 4.5.<br>
Warming the plates to 37 degrees C starts the enzyme<br>
reaction. After 90 minutes at 3 7 degrees C, 200<br>
microliters/well cold specimen diluent is added to stop<br>
the reaction and 20 microliters/well was transferred to a<br>
corresponding anti-MBP antibody coated ELISA plate for<br>
capture, containing 80 microliters/well specimen diluent.<br>
This reaction is incubated overnight at 4 degrees C and<br>
the ELISA is developed the next day after a 2 hour<br>
incubation with anti-192SW antibody, followed by<br>
Streptavidin-AP conjugate and fluorescent substrate. The<br>
signal is read on a fluorescent plate reader. .<br>
Relative compound inhibition potency is determined<br>
by calculating the concentration of compound that showed<br>
a fifty percent reduction in detected signal (IC50)<br>
compared to the enzyme reaction signal in the control<br>
wells with no added compound. In this assay, preferred<br>
compounds of the invention exhibit an IC50 of less than 50<br>
micromolar.<br>

Cell Free Inhibition Assay Utilizing a Synthetic APP<br>
Substrate<br>
341<br>
&gt;- A synthetic APP substrate that can be cleaved by<br>
beta-secretase and having N-terminal biotin and made<br>
fluorescent by the covalent attachment of Oregon green at<br>
the Cys residue is used to assay beta-secretase activity<br>
in the presence or absence of the inhibitory compounds of<br>
the invention. Useful substrates include the following:<br>

The enzyme (0.1 nanotnolar) and test compounds (0.001<br>
100 micromolar) are incubated in pre-blocked, low<br>
affinity, black plates (384 well) at 37 degrees for 30<br>
minutes. The reaction is initiated by addition of 150<br>
millimolar substrate to a final volume of 3 0 microliter<br>
per well. The final assay conditions are: 0.001 - 100<br>
micromolar compound inhibitor; 0.1 molar sodium acetate<br>
(pH 4.5); 150 nanomolar substrate; 0.1 nanomolar soluble<br>
beta-secretase; 0.001% Tween 20, and 2% DMSO. The assay<br>
mixture is incubated for 3 hours at 37 degrees C, and the<br>
reaction is terminated by the addition of a saturating<br>
concentration of immunopure streptavidin. After<br>
incubation with streptavidin at room temperature for 15<br>
minutes, fluorescence polarization is measured, for<br>
example, using a LJL Acqurest (Ex485 nm/ Em530 nm) . The<br>
activity of the beta-secretase enzyme is detected by<br>
cJbaii^pfes in the fluorescence polarization that occur when<br>
the substrate is cleaved by the enzyme. Incubation in<br>
the presence or absence of compound inhibitor<br>
demonstrates specific inhibition of beta-secretase<br>
enzymatic cleavage of its synthetic APP substrate. In<br>
this assay, preferred compounds of the invention exhibit<br>
an IC50 of less than 50 micromolar.<br>
Example C<br>
Beta-Secretase Inhibition; P26-P4'SW Assay<br>
Synthetic substrates containing the beta-secretase<br>
cleavage site of APP are used to assay beta-secretase<br>
activity, using the methods described, for example, in<br>
published PCT application WO00/47618. The P26-P4'SW<br>
substrate is a peptide of the sequence:<br>
(biotin)CGGADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNLDAEF [SEQ ID<br>
NO: 6]<br>
The P26-P1 standard has the sequence:<br>
(biotin)CGGADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL [SEQ ID NO:<br>
7] .<br>
Briefly, the biotin-coupled synthetic substrates are<br>
incubated at a concentration of from about 0 to about 200<br>
micromolar in this assay. When testing inhibitory<br>
compounds, a substrate concentration of about 1.0<br>
micromolar is preferred. Test compounds diluted in DMSO<br>
are added to the reaction mixture, with a final DMSO<br>
concentration of 5%. Controls also contain a final DMSO<br>
concentration of 5%. The concentration of beta secretase<br>
enzyme in the reaction is varied, to give product<br>
concentrations with the linear range of the ELISA assay,<br>
about 125 to 2000 picomolar, after dilution.<br>
The reaction mixture also includes 20 millimolar<br>
sodium acetate, pH 4.5, 0.06% Triton X100, and is<br>
ipcu.ba.ted at 37 degrees C for about 1 to 3 hcurs.<br>
Samples are then diluted in assay buffer (for example,<br>
145.4 nanomolar sodium chloride, 9.51 millimolar sodium<br>
phosphate, 7.7 millimolar sodium azide, 0.05% Triton<br>
X405, 6g/liter bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) to quench<br>
the reaction, then diluted further for immunoassay of the<br>
cleavage products.<br>
Cleavage products can be assayed by ELISA. Diluted<br>
samples and standards are incubated in assay plates<br>
coated with capture antibody, for example, SW192, for<br>
about 24 hours at 4 degrees C. After washing in TTBS<br>
buffer (150 millimolar sodium chloride, 25 millimolar<br>
Tris, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), the samples are incubated<br>
with streptavidin-AP according to the manufacturer's<br>
instructions. After a one hour incubation at room<br>
temperature, the samples are washed in TTBS and incubated<br>
with fluorescent substrate solution A (31.2 g/liter 2-<br>
amino-2-methyl-l-propanol, 30 mg/liter, pH 9.5).<br>
Reaction with streptavidin-alkaline phosphate permits<br>
detection by fluorescence. Compounds that are effective<br>
inhibitors of beta-secretase activity demonstrate reduced<br>
cleavage of the substrate as compared to a control.<br>
Example D<br>
Assays using Synthetic Oligopeptide-Substrates<br>
Synthetic oligopeptides are prepared that<br>
incorporate the known cleavage site of beta-secretase,<br>
and optionally detectable tags, such as fluorescent or<br>
chromogenic moieties. Examples of such peptides, as well<br>
as their production and detection methods are described<br>
in U.S. Patent No: 5,942,400, herein incorporated by<br>
reference. Cleavage products can be detected using high<br>
performance liquid chromatography, or fluorescent or<br>
oMtunogenic detection methods appropriate to the peptide<br>
to be detected, according to methods well known in the<br>
art.<br>
By way of example, one such peptide has the sequence<br>
SEVNL-DAEF [SEQ ID NO: 8] , and the cleavage site is<br>
between residues 5 and 6. Another preferred substrate<br>
has the sequence ADRGLTTRPGSGLTNIKTEEISEVNL-DAEF [SEQ<br>
ID NO: 9] , and the cleavage site is between residues 26<br>
and 27.<br>
These synthetic APP substrates are incubated in the<br>
presence of beta-secretase under conditions sufficient to<br>
result in beta-secretase mediated cleavage of the<br>
substrate. Comparison of the cleavage results in the<br>
presence of the compound inhibitor to control results<br>
provides a measure of the compound's inhibitory activity.<br>
Example E<br>
Inhibition of Beta-Secretase Activity - Cellular<br>
Assay<br>
J<br>
I<br>
An exemplary assay for the analysis of inhibition of<br>
beta-secretase activity utilizes the human embryonic<br>
kidney cell line HEKp293 (ATCC Accession No. CRL-1573)<br>
transfected with APP751 containing the naturally<br>
occurring double mutation Lys651Met52 to Asn651Leu652<br>
(numbered for APP75L), commonly called the Swedish<br>
mutation and shown to overproduce A beta (Citron et al.,<br>
1992, Nature 360:672-674), as described in U.S. Patent<br>
NO. 5,604,102.<br>
The cells are incubated in the presence/absence of<br>
the inhibitory compound (diluted in DMSO) at the desired<br>
concentration, generally up to 10 micrograms/ml. At the<br>
end of the treatment period, conditioned media is<br>
analyzed for beta-secretase activity, for example, by<br>
alWklysis of cleavage fragments. A beta can be analyzed<br>
by immunoassay, using specific detection antibodies. The<br>
enzymatic activity is measured in the presence and<br>
absence of the compound inhibitors to demonstrate<br>
specific inhibition of beta-secretase mediated cleavage<br>
of APP substrate.<br>

compound inhibitor formulated in a carrier suitable for<br>
the chosen mode of administration. Control animals are<br>
untreated, treated with vehicle, or treated with an<br>
inactive compound. Administration can be acute, i.e.,<br>
single dose or multiple doses in one day, or ca:n be<br>
chronic, i.e., dosing is repeated daily for a period of<br>
days. Beginning at time " 0, brain tissue or cerebral<br>
fluid is obtained from selected animals and analyzed for<br>
the presence of APP cleavage peptides, including A beta,<br>
for example, by immunoassay using specific antibodies for<br>
A beta detection. At the end of the test period, animals<br>
are sacrificed and brain tissue or cerebral fluid is<br>
analyzed for the presence of A beta and/or beta-amyloid<br>
plaques. The tissue is also analyzed for necrosis.<br>
Animals administered the compound inhibitors of<br>
the invention are expected to demonstrate reduced A beta<br>
in brain tissues or cerebral fluids and reduced beta<br>
amyloid plaques. in brain tissue, as compared with non-<br>
treated controls.<br>
