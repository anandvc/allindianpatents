REPEATING TRANSMISSIONS OF SIGNALS IN COMMUNICATION<br>
SYSTEMS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed, in general, to wireless communication<br>
systems and, more specifically, to a Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple<br>
Access (SC-FDMA) communication system and is further considered in the<br>
development of the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Evolved Universal<br>
Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) Long Term Evolution (LTE).<br>
In particular, the present invention considers the transmission of positive or<br>
Negative ACKnowledgement signals (ACK or NAK, respectively) over multiple<br>
transmission time intervals in an SC-FDMA communication system.<br>
2. Description of the Art<br>
Several types of signals should be supported for the proper functionality of a<br>
communication system. In addition to data signals, which convey the information<br>
content, control signals also need to be transmitted from User Equipments (UEs) to<br>
their serving base station (or Node B) in the UpLink (UL) of the communication<br>
system and from the serving Node B to UEs in the DownLink (DL) of the<br>
communication system in order to enable proper processing of the data. A UE, also<br>
commonly referred to as terminal or mobile station, may be fixed or mobile and may<br>
be a wireless device, a cellular phone, a personal computer device, a wireless modem<br>
card, etc. A Node B is generally a fixed station and may also be called a Base<br>
Transceiver System (BTS), an access point, or some other terminology.<br>
The acknowledgement signal, i.e., an ACK or NAK, also known as Hybrid<br>
Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ)-ACK, is a control signal associated with the<br>
application of HARQ and is in response to the data packet reception. A data packet is<br><br>
retransmitted if a NAK is received, and a new data packet may be transmitted if an<br>
ACK is received.<br>
The transmission of signals carrying the data information from UEs is assumed<br>
to be through a Physical Uplink Shared CHannel (PUSCH). When there is no data, a<br>
UE transmits control signals through the Physical Uplink Control CHannel<br>
(PUCCH). When there is data, a UE transmits control signals through the PUSCH in<br>
order to maintain the single carrier property.<br>
The UEs are assumed to transmit data or control signals over a Transmission<br>
Time Interval (TTI) corresponding to a sub-frame. FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram<br>
of a sub-frame structure 110. The sub-frame includes two slots. Each slot 120 further<br>
includes seven symbols used for the transmission of data and/or control signals. Each<br>
symbol 130 further includes a Cyclic Prefix (CP) in order to mitigate interference<br>
due to channel propagation effects. The signal transmission in the first slot may be at<br>
the same part, or at a different part of the operating Bandwidth (BW) than the signal<br>
transmission in the second slot. In addition to symbols carrying data or control<br>
signals, some other symbols may be used for the transmission of Reference Signals<br>
(RS), which are also referred to as pilots. The RS may be used for several receiver<br>
functions, including channel estimation and coherent demodulation of the received<br>
signal.<br>
The transmission BW is assumed to include frequency resource units, which will<br>
be referred to herein as Resource Blocks (RBs). Herein, each RB is further assumed<br>
to include 12 sub-carriers and UEs can be allocated a multiple of P consecutive RBs<br>
140 for PUSCH transmission and 1 RB for PUCCH transmission. Nevertheless, the<br>
above values are only illustrative and not restrictive to the embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a PUCCH structure 210 for the ACK/NAK transmission in one<br>
slot of a sub-frame. The transmission in the other slot, which may be at a different<br>
part of the operating BW for frequency diversity, is assumed to have the same<br><br>
structure.<br>
The PUCCH ACK/NAK transmission structure 210 includes the transmission of<br>
ACK/NAK signals and RS. The RS can be used for the coherent demodulation of the<br>
ACK/NAK signals. The ACK/NAK bits 220 modulate 230 a Constant Amplitude<br>
Zero Auto-Correlation (CAZAC) sequence 240, for example, with Binary Phase<br>
Shift Keying (BPSK) or Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK) modulation, which<br>
is then transmitted by the UE after performing the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform<br>
(IFFT) operation as will subsequently described. Each RS 250 is assumed to be<br>
transmitted through the same, unmodulated CAZAC sequence.<br>
An example of CAZAC sequences is given by the following Equation (1):<br><br>
In Equation (1), L is a length of the CAZAC sequence, n is an index of an<br>
element of the sequence n={0, 1,2..., L-l}, and k is an index of the sequence<br>
itself. For a given length L, if L is prime, there are L - 1 distinct sequences.<br>
Therefore, the entire family of sequences is defined as k ranges in {1,2...,L-l}.<br>
However, it should be noted that the CAZAC sequences used for the ACK/NAK and<br>
RS transmission need not be generated using the exact above expression as will be<br>
further discussed below.<br>
For CAZAC sequences of prime length L, the number of sequences is L-l. As<br>
the RBs are assumed to include an even number of sub-carriers, with 1 RB including<br>
12 sub-carriers, the sequences used to transmit the ACK/NAK and RS can be<br>
generated, in the frequency or time domain, by either truncating a longer prime<br>
length (such as length 13) CAZAC sequence or by extending a shorter prime length<br>
(such as length 11) CAZAC sequence by repeating its first element(s) at the end<br>
(cyclic extension), although the resulting sequences do not fulfill the technical<br>
definition of a CAZAC sequence. Alternatively, CAZAC sequences with even length<br><br>
can be directly generated through a computer search for sequences satisfying the<br>
CAZAC properties.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a transmitter structure for a CAZAC-based sequence that can<br>
be used either as an RS or to carry the ACK/NAK information bits after being<br>
modulated by them using BPSK (1 ACK/NAK bit) or QPSK (2 ACK/NAK bits)<br>
modulation, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The CAZAC sequence 310 is generated through<br>
one of the previously described methods, e.g., modulated for transmission of<br>
ACK/NAK bits, un-modulated for RS transmission. Thereafter, it is cyclically<br>
shifted 320 as will be subsequently described. The Discrete Fourier Transform<br>
(DFT) of the resulting sequence is then obtained 330. The sub-carriers 340<br>
corresponding to the assigned transmission BW are selected 350, and the IFFT is<br>
performed 360. Finally, the Cyclic Prefix (CP) 370 and filtering 380 are applied to<br>
the transmitted signal. Zero padding is assumed to be inserted by the reference UE in<br>
sub-carriers used for the signal transmission by another UE and in guard sub-carriers<br>
(not shown). Moreover, for brevity, additional transmitter circuitry such as digital-to-<br>
analog converter, analog filters, amplifiers, transmitter antennas, etc., are not<br>
illustrated in FIG. 3.<br>
At the receiver, the inverse (complementary) transmitter functions are<br>
performed. This is conceptually illustrated in FIG. 4, in which the reverse operations<br>
of those in FIG. 3 apply. As it is known in the art (not shown for brevity), an antenna<br>
receives the Radio-Frequency (RF) analog signal and, after passing further<br>
processing units, such as filters, amplifiers, frequency down-converters, and analog-<br>
to-digital converters, the digital received signal 410 passes through a time<br>
windowing unit 420 and the CP is removed 430. Subsequently, the receiver unit<br>
applies a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT 440), selects 450 the sub-carriers 460 used by<br>
the transmitter, applies an Inverse DFT (IDFT) 470, de-multiplexes (in time) the RS<br>
or ACK/NAK signal 480, and after obtaining a channel estimate based on the RS<br>
(not shown), it extracts the ACK/NAK bits 490. As for the transmitter, well known<br>
in the art receiver functionalities such as channel estimation and demodulation are<br>
not shown for brevity.<br><br>
FIG. 5 illustrates an alternative generation method for the transmitted CAZAC<br>
sequence is in the frequency domain. The generation of the transmitted CAZAC<br>
sequence follows the same steps as in the time domain with two exceptions. The<br>
frequency domain version of the CAZAC sequence is used 510, i.e., the DFT of the<br>
CAZAC sequence is pre-computed and not included in the transmission chain, and<br>
the Cyclic Shift (CS) 550 is applied after the IFFT 540. The selection 520 of the sub-<br>
carriers 530 corresponding to the assigned transmission BW, and the application of<br>
CP 560 and filtering 570 to the transmitted signal 580, as well as other conventional<br>
functionalities (not shown), are as previously described for FIG. 3.<br>
In FIG. 6, the reverse functions are again performed for the reception of the<br>
CAZAC-based sequence transmitted as in FIG. 5. The received signal 610 passes<br>
through a time windowing unit 620 and the CP is removed 630. Subsequently, the<br>
CS is restored 640, an FFT 650 is applied, and the transmitted sub-carriers 660 are<br>
selected 665. FIG. 6 also illustrates the subsequent correlation 670 with the replica<br>
680 of the CAZAC-based sequence. Finally, the output 690 is obtained, which can<br>
then be passed to a channel estimation unit, such as a time-frequency interpolator, in<br>
case of an RS, or can be used to detect the transmitted information when the<br>
CAZAC-based sequence is modulated by the ACK/NAK information bits.<br>
Different CSs of the same CAZAC sequence provide orthogonal CAZAC<br>
sequences. Therefore, different CSs of the same CAZAC sequence can be allocated<br>
to different UEs in the same RB for their RS or ACK/NAK transmission and achieve<br>
orthogonal UE multiplexing. This principle is illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, in order for the multiple CAZAC sequences 710, 730, 750,<br>
770 generated correspondingly from multiple CSs 720, 740, 760, 780 of the same<br>
root CAZAC sequence to be orthogonal, the CS value □ 790 should exceed the<br>
channel propagation delay spread D (including a time uncertainty error and filter<br>
spillover effects). If Ts is the symbol duration, the number of CSs is equal to the<br>
mathematical floor of the ratio Ts/D. For symbol duration of about 66 microseconds<br><br>
(14 symbols in a 1 millisecond sub-frame), a time separation of about 5.5<br>
microseconds between consecutive CSs results in 12 CS values. If better protection<br>
against multipath propagation is needed, only every other (6 of the 12) CS may be<br>
used to provide time separation of about 11 microseconds.<br>
Orthogonal multiplexing for the signals from different UEs in the same RB can<br>
be achieved not only through different CS values of the CAZAC sequence, as<br>
described in FIG. 7, but also through the use of different orthogonal time covers.<br>
The ACK/NAK and RS symbols are respectively multiplied with a first and a second<br>
orthogonal code. FIG. 8, which is identical to FIG. 2 with the exception of the<br>
inclusion of orthogonal time covering, further illustrates this concept.<br><br>
used in FIG. 8) or any other orthogonal code of length 3. The PUCCH multiplexing<br>
capacity with the use of orthogonal time covering is increased by a factor of 3 as it is<br>
constrained by the smaller length orthogonal code of the RS.<br><br>
PUSCH transmissions can be scheduled by the Node B through an UL<br>
Scheduling Assignment (SA) using the Physical DL Control CHannel (PDCCH) or<br>
they can be preconfigured. Using the PDCCH, a PUSCH transmission from a UE<br>
may generally occur at any sub-frame the Node B scheduler decides. Such PUSCH<br>
scheduling is referred to as dynamic. To avoid excessive PDCCH overhead, some<br>
PUSCH transmissions may be preconfigured to occur periodically at predetermined<br><br>
parts of the operating BW until re-configured. Such PUSCH transmission scheduling<br>
is referred to as semi-persistent.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates the concept of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS), which is<br>
applicable for both DL and UL. SPS is typically used for communication services<br>
having relatively small BW requirements per sub-frame but need to be provided for<br>
many UEs. One typical example of such services is Voice over Internet Protocol<br>
(VoIP) where initial packet transmissions 910 are periodic over predetermined time<br>
intervals 920. Due to the large number of UEs potentially transmitting VoIP packets<br>
in a sub-frame, dynamic scheduling through the PDCCH highly inefficient and SPS<br>
can be used instead.<br>
The Node B transmits the data packets to scheduled UEs through the Physical<br>
Downlink Shared CHannel (PDSCH). Similarly to the PUSCH, the PDSCH can be<br>
shared during the same sub-frame by multiple UEs for their packet reception from<br>
the same serving Node B, with each UE using a different part of the operating BW in<br>
order for mutual interference to be avoided. PDSCH transmissions can also be<br>
scheduled by the Node B through the PDCCH (dynamic scheduling) or can be<br>
preconfigured (SPS).<br>
As the UL communication is considered, a focus will be on the ACK/NAK<br>
signals transmitted by UEs in response to a PDSCH transmission. Because PDSCH<br>
scheduling can be dynamic or semi-persistent, the transmission of ACK/NAK signals<br>
is respectively dynamic or semi-persistent (periodic). Also, because the periodic<br>
ACK/NAK transmissions are predetermined to occur at specific sub-frames, the<br>
respective resources (RB, CAZAC sequence CS, orthogonal code) can be also<br>
predetermined and semi-persistently assigned to a SPS UE. For dynamic ACK/NAK<br>
transmissions, no such pre-assignment is possible and the respective resources need<br>
to be dynamically determined in every sub-frame.<br>
Several methods exist for a UE to use for mapping of the resources for its<br>
dynamic ACK/NAK transmission. For example, the DL SA may contain a few bits<br><br>
explicitly indicating these resources. Alternatively, implicit mapping based on the<br>
PDCCH resources used for the DL SA transmission may apply. The invention will<br>
be described using the latter option.<br>
A DL SA includes Control Channel Elements (CCEs). The coding rate applied<br>
to the DL SA transmission to a UE depends on the received Signal to Interference<br>
and Noise Ratio (SINR) that UE experiences. For example, a high or low coding rate<br>
may respectively apply to the DL SA for a UE experiencing a high or low SINR. As<br>
the contents of the DL SA are fixed, different coding rates result to different number<br>
of CCEs. A DL SA with high coding rate, such as 2/3, may require 1 CCE for its<br>
transmission while a DL SA with low coding rate, such as 1/6, may require 4 CCEs<br>
for its transmission. It is assumed that the UL resources for the- subsequent<br>
ACK/NAK transmission are derived by the number of the lowest CCE of the<br>
respective DL SA.<br>
FIG. 10 further illustrates the concept of mapping the UL ACK/NAK resources<br>
to the lowest CCE number used for the previous DL SA transmission to a reference<br>
UE. The DL SA 1 1010 to UE 1 is mapped to 4 CCEs 1011, 1012, 1013, and 1014,<br>
the DL SA 2 1020 to UE 2 is mapped to 2 CCEs 1021 and 1022, and the DL SA 3<br>
1030 to UE 3 is mapped to 1 CCE 1031. The resources for the subsequent UL<br>
ACK/NAK transmission are determined from the lowest CCE of the respective DL<br>
SAs and UE 1 uses resource ACK/NAK (A/N) 1 1040, UE 2 uses resource A/N 5<br>
1044, and UE 3 uses resource A/N 7 1046. The resources A/N 2 1041, A/N 3 1042,<br>
A/N 4 1043, and A/N 6 1045 are not used for any dynamic ACK/NAK transmission.<br>
The transmission of UL SAs may also be based on the concept of CCE but this is not<br>
shown for brevity.<br>
In addition to periodic and dynamic ACK/NAK signals, another periodic control<br>
signal a UE may transmit is the Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) informing the<br>
serving Node B of the channel conditions the UE experiences in the DL of the<br>
communication system which are typically represented by a SINR. Other periodic<br>
control signals include the Service Request (SR) indicating a scheduling need, or the<br><br>
Rank Indicator (RI) indicating support for spatial multiplexing in case the serving<br>
Node B has 2 or more transmitter antennas. Therefore, the UL is assumed to support<br>
dynamic and semi-persistent PUSCH transmissions, dynamic ACK/NAK<br>
transmissions, periodic ACK/NAK transmissions, and other periodic control signals.<br>
All control channels are jointly referred to as PUCCH.<br>
ACK/NAK signaling is the fundamental mechanism for a UE and its serving<br>
Node B to exchange information about the reception outcome of a prior data packet<br>
transmission. Therefore, the ACK/NAK reception reliability, as typically measured<br>
by the Bit Error Rate (BER), is essential to the proper operation of the<br>
communication system. For example, incorrect interpretation of NAK as ACK<br>
causes an incorrectly received packet to not be retransmitted, which in turn may<br>
result in a failure of the remaining communication session until the error is corrected<br>
by higher layers.<br>
As several UEs may operate under low UL SINRs or be situated in coverage<br>
limited locations, the nominal ACK/NAK transmission over one sub-frame may<br>
often not be adequate to provide the required reception reliability. For such UEs, it is<br>
essential to extend their ACK/NAK transmission periods. A longer transmission<br>
period offers more ACK/NAK symbols which can be combined at the Node B<br>
receiver to effectively increase the total received SINR.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been designed to solve at least the<br>
aforementioned problems occurring in the prior art, and the present invention<br>
provides methods and apparatus for enabling repetitions for the transmission of<br>
dynamic or periodic ACK/NAK signals from UEs.<br>
Further, the present invention provides methods and apparatus for repeating<br>
ACK/NAK transmissions from UEs over multiple sub-frames.<br><br>
The present invention also provides methods and apparatus to provide separate<br>
mechanisms for repeating dynamic ACK/NAK transmissions and periodic<br>
ACK/NAK transmissions.<br>
Additionally, the present invention specifies the behavior of a UE with respect to<br>
transmissions of other, control or data, signals that may need to occur in the same<br>
sub-frames as an ACK/NAK transmission with repetitions.<br>
Additionally, the present invention enables the determination of the PUCCH<br>
resources for the repetitions of the dynamic or periodic ACK/NAK transmissions to<br>
avoid interference with other signal transmitted by other UEs to the same serving<br>
Node B.<br>
Additionally, the present invention enables the repetitions of an ACK/NAK<br>
transmission by a UE to complete while ensuring well defined and stable system<br>
operation.<br>

apparatus and method for a UE, having repetitions for an ACK/NAK signal<br>
transmission in response to a data packet transmitted to it by the serving Node B<br>

transmission in at least two sub-frames.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is<br>
provided an apparatus and method for a UE, having transmission of an ACK/NAK<br>
signal in response to a data packet transmitted to it in a semi-persistent manner by<br>
the serving Node B without a SA, to determine the resources for the ACK/NAK<br>
signal transmission in at least two sub-frames.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, there is<br>
provided a method to specify the behavior of a UE with respect to the transmission<br>
of additional control or data signals while the UE is transmitting an ACK/NAK<br><br>
signal with repetitions.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br><br>
The present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may, however, be embodied<br>
in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments<br>
set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will<br>
be thorough and complete and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Additionally, although the present invention is described in relation to a Single-<br>
Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) communication system, it<br>
also applies to all FDM systems in general and to Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiple Access (OFDMA), OFDM, FDMA, DFT-spread OFDM, Discrete Fourier<br>
Transform (DFT)-spread OFDMA, Single-Carrier OFDMA (SC-OFDMA), and SC-<br>
OFDM in particular.<br>
System and methods of the embodiments of the present invention are related to<br>
the need for a UE to transmit a, dynamic or periodic, ACK/NAK signal over more<br>
than one sub-frame (repetition of ACK/NAK signal transmission) without causing<br>
interference to the transmission of signals by other UEs to the same serving Node B,<br>
and to enable the completion of ACK/NAK signal transmissions over more than one<br>
sub-frame while providing a well defined and stable system operation.<br>
Several possible partitions exist for the RBs used for dynamic and semi-<br>
persistent PUSCH transmissions, for dynamic and periodic ACK/NAK transmissions,<br>
and for periodic transmission of CQI or other control signals in the PUCCH. FIG. 11<br>
illustrates an example for such a partition.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the RBs for periodic transmissions, such as CQI, 1110A<br>
and 1110B, semi-persistent ACK/NAK, 1120A and 1120B, or semi-persistent<br>
PUSCH 1130A and 1130B, are located towards the edge of the operating BW to<br>
avoid BW fragmentation. They are also located to the exterior of the RBs for<br>
dynamic ACK/NAK transmissions, 1140A and 1140B, which are again placed<br><br>
adjacent and to the exterior of the RBs for dynamic PUSCH transmissions 1150A<br>
and 1150B.<br>
The reason for the RB partition in FIG. 11 is that the RBs for dynamic<br>
ACK/NAK may vary between sub-frames in a non-predetermined manner (the RBs<br>
for periodic PUCCH and semi-persistent PUSCH may also vary between sub-frames<br>
but this happens in a predetermined manner). Placing the RBs for dynamic<br>
ACK/NAK next to the RBs for dynamic PUSCH enables any variation in the number<br>
of the former to be incorporated into the latter because the single carrier property of<br>
UL signal transmissions requires the allocated RBs to be contiguous. Accordingly,<br>
BW fragmentation would occur if the RBs for dynamic ACK/NAK were not located<br>
next to the ones for dynamic PUSCH.<br>
The structure in FIG. 11 enables for ACK/NAK repetitions by expanding the<br>
ACK/NAK transmission in RBs in the dynamic PUSCH region. For implicit, CCE-<br>
based mapping of resources used for dynamic ACK/NAK transmissions, the UEs<br>
should know how many RBs are assigned in each sub-frame to the periodic<br>
transmissions in order to determine the RB for the first dynamic ACK/NAK<br>
transmissions. This information can be provided by the serving Node B through a<br>
broadcast channel because the variation of the RBs used for periodic transmissions is<br>
over much longer time periods than hundreds of sub-frames.<br>
Repetitions of ACK/NAK transmissions are assumed to be UE-specific, that is,<br>
only UEs for which the desired ACK/NAK BER cannot be achieved with<br>
transmission over one sub-frame perform additional transmissions of the same<br>
ACK/NAK signal over more sub-frames (coverage limited UEs). Implicit mapping<br>
of the ACK/NAK resources is assumed and the UE cannot automatically use the<br>
same resources in the next sub-frame for the repetition of its ACK/NAK<br>
transmission as they may be used by another UE.<br>
For semi-persistent PDSCH scheduling, the Node B knows the ACK/NAK<br>
transmission requirements from the semi-persistently scheduled UEs and can<br><br>
configure each such UE to use a distinct set of resources (e.g., orthogonal cover,<br>
cyclic shift, and RB) for each repetition.<br>
The remaining of this disclosure concerns the repetitions of ACK/NAK<br>
transmissions associated with dynamic PDSCH scheduling. It is assumed that the<br>
resources each UE uses for its ACK/NAK transmission are implicitly determined<br>
from the associated DL SA as described in FIG. 10.<br>
A first ACK/NAK transmission structure is illustrated in FIG. 12. Only the<br>
upper half of the B W is illustrated for simplicity, corresponding to the upper half in<br>
FIG. 11, because the same structure applies in the lower part of the BW. For a first<br>
ACK/NAK signal, A/N 1 1210, transmission in 2 additional sub-frames is assumed.<br>
For a second and third ACK/NAK signals, A/N 2 1220 and A/N 3 1230,<br>
transmission over 1 additional sub-frame is assumed. For a fourth and fifth<br>
ACK/NAK signals, A/N 4 1240 and A/N 5 1250, no additional transmission beyond<br>
the initial sub-frame is assumed. Although the transmission structure illustrated in<br>
FIG. 12 shows no particular issues other than the additional RB overhead, this is<br>
because of the assumed requirements for the ACK/NAK repetitions.<br>
BW fragmentation can frequently occur if the total number of ACK/NAK<br>
transmissions is larger than two as illustrated in FIG. 13. For a first ACK/NAK<br>
signal, A/N 1 1310, transmission in 2 additional sub-frames is assumed. For a third<br>
ACK/NAK signal, A/N 3 1330, transmission over 1 additional sub-frame is assumed.<br>
For a second, fourth, and fifth ACK/NAK signals, A/N 1 1320, A/N 4 1340 and A/N<br>
5 1350, no additional transmission beyond the initial sub-frame is assumed. The<br>
number of fragmented RBs can be as large as the maximum number of total<br>
ACK/NAK transmissions minus two. For example, for a total of 4 ACK/NAK<br>
transmissions, the maximum number of fragmented RBs is 2.<br>
One issue with applying straightforward RB expansion to support ACK/NAK<br>
repetitions is the growth in the associated overhead, particularly for the smaller BWs.<br>
For example, for an operating BW with 6 RBs, using RB expansion to support 3 or<br><br>
more transmissions of the same ACK/NAK signal leads to 50% or more PUCCH<br>
overhead in some sub-frames, which is usually too large. An alternative approach is<br>
therefore required.<br>
The implicit mapping of the UL ACK/NAK resources based on the CCEs used<br>
for the respective DL SA transmission leads to several unutilized ACK/NAK<br>
resources. For example, for an operating BW of 6 RBs, the implicit mapping can<br>
consume a maximum of 6 UL ACK/NAK resources. Considering the ACK/NAK<br>
multiplexing capacity of the structure illustrated in FIG. 8, the number of<br>
ACK/NAK resources is 18 (6 from the CS times 3 from the orthogonal covers) and<br>
therefore 12 resources for ACK/NAK transmission remain available after the first<br>
transmission. Then, up to two additional repetitions of an ACK/NAK transmission<br>
can be accommodated in the same RB by the UE simply adding 6 to the resource<br>
number used for its initial ACK/NAK transmission or of its first repetition, if more<br>
than one repetition is to be performed.<br>
The above-mentioned process is illustrated in FIG. 14, which assumes the same<br>
conditions as FIG. 13, but now the ACK/NAK repetitions are confined within the<br>
same RB as the initial transmission (18 resources for the ACK/NAK transmission are<br>
assumed within 1 RB). The ACK/NAK transmission A/N 1 1410 from UE 1 uses the<br>
first UL ACK/NAK resource 1411 in a first sub-frame and uses the seventh 1412 and<br>
thirteenth 1413 UL ACK/NAK resources for the transmission of the same<br>
ACK/NAK signal in a second sub-frame and in a third sub-frame, respectively. The<br>
ACK/NAK transmission A/N 3 1430 from UE 3 uses the third UL ACK/NAK<br>
resource 1431 in a first sub-frame and uses the ninth 1432 UL ACK/NAK resource<br>
for the transmission of the same ACK/NAK signal in a second sub-frame. The<br>
ACK/NAK transmissions A/N 2 1420, A/N 4 1440, and A/N 5 1450 are only in one<br>
sub-frame (no repetitions).<br>
Using the same RB to multiplex repetitions of ACK/NAK transmissions in<br>
subsequent sub-frames in FIG. 14 can extend to any scenario for which the<br>
maximum resources required for the first ACK/NAK transmissions in a sub-frame<br><br>
are known in advance to always be fewer than the ACK/NAK multiplexing capacity<br>
in one RB. In general, if the initial ACK/NAK transmissions from all UEs require a<br>
maximum of M resources while J resources are available in one RB, with M 
first repetition of the ACK/NAK transmission from a UE in the next sub-frame may<br>
occur in the same RB as the initial one if the ACK/NAK resource k used by the UE<br>
for the initial ACK/NAK transmission in the first sub-frame is such that k 
Then, the UE uses resource M + k for the repetition of its ACK/NAK transmission in<br>
the second sub-frame. The same principles can extent to multiple repetitions.<br>
Another issue related to the ACK/NAK transmission over more than one sub-<br>
frame is the subsequent PDSCH scheduling. Assuming either BPSK or QPSK<br>
modulation for the ACK/NAK and the same duration for the DL and UL sub-frames,<br>
a UE requiring a total of N\UL sub-frames for an ACK/NAK transmission can again<br>
be scheduled before N-\ DL sub-frames only if it has 1-bit ACK/NAK as there can<br>
be no more than 2 ACK/NAK bits in a single transmission (QPSK). The present<br>
invention also considers that a UE configured by higher layers to transmit an<br>
ACK/NAK signal over N sub-frames (N &gt; 1) is implicitly configured a 2-bit<br>
ACK/NAK transmission over 2N sub-frames. A 1-bit or a 2-bit ACK/NAK<br>
transmission occurs, respectively, when the UE receives a data packet including 1 or<br>
2 codewords.<br>
A UE should not wait before transmitting the second ACK/NAK bit as its<br>
resources are implicitly derived per sub-frame from the DL SA. A delayed<br>
ACK/NAK transmission may thus interfere with one from another UE. Consequently,<br>
even for 1-bit ACK/NAK, only one such transmission can occur during the next N-sub-frames because having a UE which is coverage limited for 1-bit ACK/NAK<br>
revert to a 2-bit ACK/NAK transmission will simply prolong the number of sub-<br>
frames required for the completion of the transmission for both ACK/NAK bits. The<br>
total number of required sub-frames will be the same as the one for separate<br>
ACK/NAK transmissions. Also, additional resources will be required because the<br>
transmission of the second ACK/NAK bit will last longer than a single 1-bit<br>
transmission.<br><br>
Two options exist to address the above issue. The first is to avoid scheduling a<br>
UE for the next N-l DL sub-frames after its last PDSCH scheduling. A UE<br>
configured ACK/NAK transmission over TV sub-frames (N &gt; 1) that receives a DL<br>
SA in sub-frame n, and has not received a DL SA in the previous n-N+1 sub-frames<br>
(the ones with sub-frame numbers n-l, ..., n-N+1), does not transmit ACK/NAK<br>
signals in response to DL SAs over the next n+N-1 sub-frames (sub-frame numbers<br>
n+l, ..., n+N-l). The second is to enable scheduling of a UE after MDL sub-frames,<br>
with M<n but avoid scheduling the ue for next x dl sub-frames.></n>
Regarding transmission in the PUSCH of an ACK/NAK signal requiring<br>
transmission over more than one sub-frame in the PUCCH, the respective BER<br>
should be considered. Given that ACK/NAK transmission in the PUSCH shares the<br>
allocated resources with other signals, such as the data signal or possible periodic<br>
control signals (such as CQI), the ACK/NAK BER in the PUSCH can become<br>
substantially worse than the PUCCH one. Therefore, having ACK/NAK transmission<br>
in the PUSCH only prolongs the completion of that ACK/NAK transmission and<br>
increases the latency of the communication. This also complicates management of<br>
the ACK/NAK resources and may lead to increased overhead requirements to<br>
support ACK/NAK repetition. Moreover, the performance of data or other control<br>
signals in the PUSCH is degraded.<br>
To avoid the above complications and maintain a simple solution for supporting<br>
ACK/NAK repetitions, a UE requiring ACK/NAK repetitions should not have any<br>
PUSCH transmissions before it completes an ACK/NAK one. For example, the UE<br>
may not attempt detection of SAs leading to such PUSCH transmissions or may<br>
ignore such SAs if it detects them. Therefore, a UE configured to transmit an<br>
ACK/NAK signal over N sub-frames (N&gt; 1), and receives a DL SA in sub-frame n,<br>
and has not received a DL SA in the previous n-N+1 sub-frames (the ones with sub-<br>
frame numbers n-l, ..., n-N+1), should not transmit in PUSCH during the sub-<br>
frames over which it transmits the ACK/NAK signal in response to the DL SA<br>
received in sub-frame n.<br><br>
Following the same reasoning as above, a UE configured ACK/NAK repetitions<br>
should not transmit CQI or RI signals whenever it transmits ACK/NAK (in the<br>
PUCCH). It should be noted that without repetitions of the ACK/NAK transmission<br>
in multiple sub-frames, none of the previous restrictions related to any of the<br>
aforementioned signal transmissions applies.<br>
FIG. 15 illustrates the above concepts for when the UE does not transmit in the<br>
PUSCH (for example, by either ignoring or by not responding to UL SAs) and<br>
requires one repetition for its ACK/NAK transmission. The concept can be easily<br>
generalized to more than one repetition.<br>
Referring to FIG. 15, after the UE receives a DL SA in sub-frame n 1510, it<br>
transmits the respective ACK/NAK (and one repetition) in UL sub-frames n+Q 1520<br>
and n+Q+1 1530. During these UL sub-frames, the UE is not responsive to any<br>
previous UL SA resulting to PUSCH transmission (or to transmission in any UL<br>
channel) and transmits only the ACK/NAK signal until it completes the pre-<br>
determined number of repetitions.<br>
