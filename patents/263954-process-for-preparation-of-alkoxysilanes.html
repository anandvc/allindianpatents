				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a process for the<br>
preparation of alkoxysilanes, most preferably trialkoxysilanes, utilizing<br>
microwave or RF energy. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
a process for the preparation of alkoxysilanes wherein silicon metal and a<br>
copper catalyst are exposed to microwave or RF radiation in the presence<br>
of an appropriate alcohol and a catalyst to yield the corresponding<br>
trialkoxysilane.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Alkoxysilanes, specifically trialkoxysilanes, and particularly<br>
trimethoxysilane and triethoxysilane are important items of commerce. The<br>
alkoxysilanes serve as raw materials in the production of coupling agents<br>
that are critical to many industrial segments including adhesive and<br>
sealants, coatings, plastics, fabrics, medical devices, cosmetics and<br>
others. Although there are many reports of methods to produce<br>
trialkoxysilanes none provide a simple and sustainable process.<br>
Alkoxysilanes are well known in industry and are used in the •<br>
preparation of organosilanes that are suitable for use in many applications<br>
including their use as coupling agents.<br>
Traditional chemical approaches to alkoxysilanes include the<br>
hydrochlorination of silicon metal with subsequent hydrosilylation and<br>
esterification. The first step of this three step process requires a significant<br>
equipment investment due to the high temperatures required and corrosion<br>
which results.<br><br>
A direct two step method was subsequently developed which<br>
involved the direct reaction of alcohols with silicone metal. This process<br>
was limited to methanol as alcohols of higher chain length proved to be<br>
unreactive or to have little reactivity towards silicon metal under the<br>
process conditions. The use of methanol, while useful in creating a<br>
trialkoxysilane which can be further reacted, is limited by the elimination of<br>
the toxic methanol as a byproduct upon cure or by reaction with moisture.<br>
Improvements in the direct chemistry approach that allowed<br>
preparation with higher chain alcohols utilized a heat transfer agent, such<br>
as, a solvent, temperatures of 230 °C to 240 °C, and very long reaction<br>
times. The catalyst choice is reported to be critical as the catalyst must<br>
have solubility in the solvent. Copper II salts of carboxylic acids were<br>
found to perform effectively. Both the direct process and the<br>
hydrochlorination process are reported to be used within the industry.<br>
Fluidized bed processes are also reported, however, they are reported to<br>
suffer from hot spots and a significant reduction in selectivity.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 3,071,700 describes a process for the<br>
production of alkoxysilanes where finely divided silicon is reacted in the<br>
liquid phase by contact with alcohols and phenols yielding a mono-, di-, tri-<br>
and tetramethoxysilanes.<br>
The direct synthesis of trialkoxysilanes is disclosed in U.S. Patent<br>
Number 3,775,077 by Rochow. The patent teaches the preparation of<br>
trialkoxysilanes by directly reacting a copper - silicon mass suspended in a<br>
silicone oil with an alcohol at 250 °C - 300 °C. The copper - silicon mass<br>
contains about 10 weight percent copper and is prepared by heating the<br>
copper - silicon mass in excess of 1000 °C. The method results in low<br>
yields of the trialkoxysilane.<br><br>
U.S. Patent Number 3,775,457 teaches the use of polyaromatic<br>
hydrocarbon oils as solvents for the direct process using finely divided<br>
silicon with cuprous chloride as catalyst. Although the cuprous chloride<br>
results in a yield improvement versus the activated copper - silicon mass<br>
of U.S. 3,775,077 the use of cuprous chloride results in the need for<br>
expensive corrosion resistant materials of construction for the reactor and<br>
related equipment. Additionally, the use of cuprous chloride acts to<br>
catalyze the reaction of the trialkoxysilane to the tetraalkoxysilane which<br>
reduces the yield of the trialkoxysilane.<br>
Additionally, when methanol is a reactant for producing<br>
trimethoxysilane, the use of cuprous chloride leads to formation of HCI<br>
which will react with some of the methanol to yield methyl chloride and<br>
water. This result leads to inefficiency with regard to the methanol usage.<br>
Water produced by the reaction can react with the trialkoxysilane and<br>
tetraalkoxysilane to produce soluble and gelled siloxanes thus further<br>
reducing the efficiency of the reaction. The presence of water can also<br>
adversely affect the silicon conversion. Other patents, for example the<br>
Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho 55-28928, 55-28929, 55-76891, 57-108094,<br>
and 62-96433 which disclose the use of cuprous or cupric chloride are<br>
subject to the same limitations.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,727,173 discloses the use of copper (II)<br>
hydroxide as catalyst which avoids the limitations associated with cuprous<br>
chloride and provides high selectivity to the trialkoxysilanes. The preferred<br>
solvents are diphenyl ether, polyaromatic hydrocarbons and alkylated<br>
benzenes such as dodecylbenzene. However, when copper (II) hydroxide<br>
is used in combination with alkylated benzenes, such as dodecylbenzene,<br>
the direct synthesis of trialkoxysilanes becomes unstable after about 25 -<br>
35 weight percent of the silicon has been reacted. When methanol is the<br>
alcohol reactant at temperatures above 220 °C, the trimethoxysilane<br>
content declines after approximately 90-95 weight percent to approximately<br>
50-60 weight percent and recovers again to 80-95 weight percent after<br><br>
approximately 60 percent silicon conversion. Coupled with the loss of<br>
selectivity is the enhanced formation of methane, water and dimethyl ether.<br>
Methane and dimethyl ether formation represent inefficient use of the<br>
alcohol reagent. The problems associated with water generation are noted<br>
above.<br>
Alcohol dehydration and dehydrogenation are troublesome with the<br>
use of ethanol and other higher homologs in the direct synthesis approach.<br>
At some temperatures (&gt;250 °C) alkenes, and aldehydes are formed in<br>
significant amounts at the expense of the desired trialkoxysilane. The<br>
presence of these undesired products can also have a negative effect on<br>
the catalytic activity in terms of inhibition. At lower temperatures (
the alcohol decomposition products are less prevalent but the direct<br>
synthesis is impractically slow. Japanese Kokai Tokkyo Koho 55-2641<br>
discloses the use of cyclic ethers to improve reactivity and selectivity to<br>
triethoxysilane when the direct synthesis is conducted in dodecylbenzene<br>
at these low temperatures. Cyclic ethers such as dibenzo-18-crown-6 are<br>
quite expensive. Others such as 12-crown-4 are toxic.<br>
A process for producing controlled selectivity mixtures of<br>
trialkoxysilane and tetraalkoxysilane is described in U.S. Patent Number<br>
4,762,939. The use of a mixed solvent system is useful in controlling the<br>
selectivity between the tri- and tetra-substituted products over a wide<br>
range. An inert solvent along with a solvent that promotes the reactivity of<br>
the trialkoxysilane with alcohol to produce the tetraalkoxysilane represent<br>
the preferred mixture. The teachings are especially designed to produce<br>
the tetraalkoxysilane.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 4,762,938 describes the preparation of<br>
alkoxysilanes by reacting halosilanes with monhydric alcohols and a trialkyl<br>
phosphite. In reactions using chlorosilanes, the hydrogen chloride that is<br>
formed during the esterification must be removed quickly from the reaction<br>
mixture in order to ensure complete reaction, to obtain a hydrogen chloride<br><br>
free product and to prevent undesirable side reactions. To achieve this it<br>
is often necessary to utilized complex and expensive manufacturing<br>
processes and plants and is difficult to achieve in an industrial scale. In<br>
addition the resulting product mixture contains the strong smelling trialkyl<br>
phosphite and the close boiling points between the phosphite and products<br>
may make purification difficult.<br>
A process for producing trialkoxysilanes including an activation step<br>
wherein elemental silicon and copper catalysts are activated, a reaction<br>
step wherein an alcohol is reacted with the activated silicon/catalyst<br>
complex and a purification step wherein a halide is introduced into the<br>
reaction mixture is described in U.S. Patent Number 4,931,578. This<br>
process results in a more stable product. Although high levels of silicon<br>
conversion and high selectivity are reported, the activation sequence and<br>
overall time make this process unattractive.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,103,034 discloses a process to make<br>
alkyldialkoxysilanes and trialkoxysilanes using silicon metal and either an<br>
alcohol, an acetal and/or an orthocarboxylic acid ester. Over all<br>
conversions of silicon and the selectivity to the trialkoxysilane are both very<br>
low.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 5,527,937 discloses a process for the Direct<br>
Synthesis of triethoxysilane wherein copper chloride is the catalyst and tri-<br>
or tetra- toluenes and/or their alkyl substituted derivatives are the solvents<br>
and dimethylsilicone is used as an antifoaming agent. The polyphenyl<br>
solvents are expensive heat transfer agents.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,728,858 teaches the use of a reducing agent to<br>
improve the activity of the silicon-copper catalyst. Improved yields of the<br>
trialkoxysilanes are cited with the use of the alkylated benzene and<br>
polyaromatic solvents. Activation of the silicon-copper catalyst can<br>
generate impurities that can adversely effect the reaction so efforts must<br><br>
be taken to remove them prior to the reaction. Reaction times are also<br>
very long making the process impractical from a commercial perspective.<br>
The use of surface active additives in the direct synthesis of<br>
trialkoxysilanes is described in U.S. Patent Number 5,783,720. The<br>
additives which are described as silicone antifoaming compounds and<br>
fluorosilicone polymers are stated to shorten the reaction induction time<br>
and time to steady state rates. Extreme care must be taken to ensure the<br>
products are not contaminated with the surface-active agents and that<br>
such surface-active agents do not induce any adverse pathways in the<br>
reaction. Contamination of the products can cause severe application<br>
performance problems.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,242,628 describes the preparation of<br>
alkoxysilanes by reaction of a chlorosilane and an alcohol. The process as<br>
described is cited as producing low acidic chloride containing products and<br>
involves addition of a metal alcoholate to the separated product to<br>
neutralize the acid component followed by reduced pressure distillation. If<br>
the neutralization is carried out at relatively high temperatures the<br>
neutralization process gives rise to secondary reactions which result in a<br>
reduction of product yield. The presence of the acid chloride in the<br>
reaction mixture requires the use of expensive corrosion resistant<br>
equipment.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,380,414 describes a process wherein<br>
trialkoxysilanes are prepared by the reaction of silicon metal and an alcohol<br>
in the presence of copper (II) oxide. The use of copper (II) oxide is<br>
described to produce an alkoxysilane in high conversion from the silicon<br>
and with high selectivity with regard to trialkoxysilane to tetraalkoxysilane.<br>
The process is limiting as the copper (II) oxide is required to be of a very<br>
narrow particle size distribution and is preferably generated from freshly<br>
precipitated copper (II) oxide. Additionally, the time to reach conversion is<br>
very long requiring 22 to 28 hours.<br><br>
JP-A-101168084 relates to the preparation of trialkoxysilanes by<br>
reacting silicon metal and alcohol over a copper (II) oxide catalyst which<br>
has water content of 
may require a thermal pretreatment of the catalyst and hence an additional<br>
reaction step.<br>
EP-A 0 517 398 discloses a process for preparing trialkoxysilanes<br>
*<br>
by reacting silicon with a solution of hydrogen fluoride or a salt which can<br>
be hydrolyzed to form hydrogen fluoride in a liquid primary or secondary<br>
alcohol, with or without the addition of a copper catalyst. However, the use<br>
of hydrogen fluoride is problematic, since hydrogen fluoride is extremely<br>
toxic and can attack glass. Furthermore, the actual reaction has to be<br>
preceded by a pretreatment step in this process since CuF2 itself is inactive<br>
as a catalyst.<br>
The use of a copper salt as catalyst whose anion contains at least<br>
one non-hydrolyzable fluorine atom for preparing trialkoxysilanes is<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent Number 6,410,771.<br>
The non-hydrolyzable fluorine containing catalyst can also be used<br>
with additional copper containing catalysts. Good conversion and<br>
selectivity are described, however, very long reaction times are required to<br>
complete the reaction.<br>
U.S. Patent Number 6,580,000 and U.S. Patent Number 6,680,399<br>
disclose the preparation of alkoxysilanes by reacting silicon metal with an<br>
alcohol in the presence of a cupric bis(diorganophosphate) catalyst. The<br>
reaction is carried out in a polymeric form of ethyl orthosilicate as solvent.<br>
The preferred catalyst is cupric bis(diethyl phosphate). The use of the<br>
cupric bis(diorganophosphate) while favoring the selectivity of the<br>
trialkoxysilane does not afford the selectivity associated with other<br>
catalysts. Additionally, the ethyl orthosilicate solvent contains 28% of one<br>
of the reaction products, tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The presence of the<br><br>
product (TEOS) in the reaction mixture makes quantitative analysis difficult<br>
and shifts the equilibrium to the tetra substituted silicon. Very long reaction<br>
times are required to achieve the results disclosed.<br>
Lipschutz, et al., in Organic Letters, 5(17),3085-3088, describes the<br>
reduction of dialkyl ketones to trialkylsilyl ethers using copper hydride -<br>
ligand complex under classical synthetic conditions and with sodium tert-<br>
butoxide in the presence of microwave radiation. Microwave and RF<br>
irradiation can accelerate the rate of chemical reactions by way of localized<br>
superheating of the reaction mixture. In the presence of a metal catalyst<br>
this effect is further enhanced. In many cases, microwave and RF heating<br>
is more energy efficient than conventional heating methods. Silicon<br>
nitride and oxide films and nanowires have been prepared in a microwave<br>
plasma environment. Crystalline silicon nanoparticles have been produced<br>
by the microwave decomposition of silane. However, there are no reports<br>
of a process for preparation of alkoxysilanes which employs microwave or<br>
RF irradiation.<br>
In view of the deficiencies of the known art, there remains a need for<br>
a simple direct synthesis process without the need for pre or post<br>
treatment, which can be completed in a reasonable period of time with high<br>
conversion and selectivity towards the trialkoxysilane. The use of<br>
controlled microwave or RF generator provides such a process directed to<br>
preparation of alkoxysilanes by. applying microwave or RF irradiation to<br>
silicon and alcohol in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for<br>
preparation of an alkoxysilane represented by the formula:<br><br><br>
wherein n is from 0 to about 2; and wherein each R is independently<br>
selected from a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl of 1-12 carbon atoms, aryl,<br>
and acyl, wherein at least one of the alkyl, aryl and acyl groups is optionally<br>
substituted by at least one alkyl, alkoxy, halo, cyano or aryl;<br>
the process including the step of:<br>
contacting elemental silicon and a hydroxy compound represented<br>
by the formula:<br>
ROH<br>
wherein R is selected from a linear, branched or cyclic alkyl of 1-12<br>
carbon atoms, aryl, and acyl, wherein at least one of the alkyl, aryl and acyl<br>
groups is optionally substituted by at least one alkyl, alkoxy, halo, cyano or<br>
aryl;<br>
wherein the contacting is carried out in the presence of a catalyst<br>
including at least one of copper, zinc, and nickel, and a non-ionizing<br>
radiation selected from microwave, radio frequency (RF), and a<br>
combination thereof, at a temperature, pressure, and length of time<br>
sufficient to form the alkoxysilane.<br>
Such alkoxysiianes have not been previously prepared by the use of<br>
microwave and/or RF energy. The use of microwave and/or RF energy<br>
overcomes the problems associated with the prior art.<br>
The use of microwave energy in the present invention yielded the<br>
desired alkoxysilane products with high conversion and high selectivity.<br>
Further, because an effective conversion can be achieved at much<br>
lower temperatures and shorter times than previously known, the present<br>
process produces fewer and lower levels of undesirable by-products and<br>
offers significant economic advantages.<br><br>
Still further, the present process affords a simple, clean, rapid,<br>
sustainable, tow temperature, short induction time, short reaction time, high<br>
conversion, and highly selective route to alkoxysilanes.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides a process to prepare trialkoxysilanes<br>
of the formula HSi(OR)3 wherein R is an aikyl group containing at least 1<br>
carbon atom. The production of the trialkoxysilane and tetraalkoxysilane is<br>
preferred with the production of the trialkoxysilane being particularly<br>
preferred.<br>
The alkoxysilane is represented by the formula:<br><br>
Preferably, n is from 0 to about 2, more preferably n is from about 1<br>
to about 2, and most preferably, n is 0, 1 or 2.<br>

The process includes reacting an alcohol with a slurry of silicon<br>
metal and a copper catalyst with or without an inert solvent in the presence<br>
of a microwave field or RF field.<br><br>
The process of the present invention produces preferably the<br>
trialkoxysilane in high selectivity with high silicon conversion in relatively<br>
short time cycles.<br>
Activation of the silicon metal and catalyst are also not required.<br>
The process can be run as a batch, semi-continuous or continuous<br>
process.<br>
Metallic silicon used as one of the reactants in the present invention<br>
is suitably one having a purity of 80% by weight or more. Metallic silicon<br>
having up to about 1% by weight of Al, Fe, Ca, Mg, Zn, Ti, Cr, Ni, Mn, Ba,<br>
Cu, Zr and other impurities can be used. The metallic silicon used in the<br>
invention is suitably granular. There is little limitation of the size of the<br>
metallic silicon particle. Particle size of the metallic silicon can range from<br>
50 to 700 microns, with particle size of about 200 microns being preferred.<br>
The alcohols used in the invention having one or more carbon<br>
atoms can be straight chain or branched chain, including, methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, sec-butanol, isobutanol, tert-<br>
butanol and the like. Among the alcohols methanol and ethanol are most<br>
preferred. The alcohols are preferably of a purity of 95% or more. The<br>
alcohols do not need to be anhydrous but should contain a low level of<br>
water preferably of about 500 ppm. Alcohols that are not anhydrous can<br>
be treated with a dehydrating agent to reduce the water content.<br>
The feed rate of the alcohol to the reaction system can vary<br>
depending upon the reaction with the minimum feed rate being at least<br>
from 0.2 mL/min. The alcohol can be diluted with an inert solvent or can<br>
be accompanied by an inert gas feed.<br>
The catalyst used in this invention is not particularly restricted and<br>
can be those conventionally used, such as copper catalysts, zinc catalysts,<br>
nickel catalysts and the like.<br><br>
Preferably, the catalyst is selected from copper(O), copper(l) salts,<br>
copper(ll) salts, copper (II) hydroxide, zinc(O), zinc(ll), nickel(O), nlckel(ll),<br>
salts thereof, complexes thereof, and any mixtures thereof.<br>
While not limiting copper catalysts are preferred. Specifically,<br>
copper salts such as cuprous chloride, cupric chloride, copper bromide,<br>
copper iodide, copper fluoride, copper carbonate, copper sulfate, copper<br>
acetate, copper oxalate, copper thiocyanate and the like; copper containing<br>
inorganic compounds such as cuprous hydroxide, cupric hydroxide, copper<br>
cyanide, copper sulfide, copper oxide, and the like; organic copper<br>
compounds, such as copper methoxide, copper ethoxide, copper<br>
allyloxide, copper acetate, copper stearate, copper<br>
tetramethylheptanedionate, copper acetylacetonate, copper naphthenate,<br>
copper phenylate, pentafluorphenylcopper dimer, copper<br>
bis(diorganophoshate) such as copper bis(diethylphosphate) and the like;<br>
and metallic copper can be used.<br>
No particular preparation method or purification method is required<br>
for any of the catalysts with the exception of ensuring low-moisture<br>
contents.<br>
The catalyst can be supplied to the reaction system in the form of a<br>
mixed powder with metallic silicon or as supported with or on metallic<br>
silicon or in a fixed or non-fixed bed. If desired the catalyst and silicon<br>
metal can be subjected to an activation treatment either in the presence or<br>
absence of a microwave or RF field.<br>
The amount of catalyst used in the invention is minimally 0.001<br>
moles. The catalyst can be added continuously or in multiple additions<br>
over a period of time, such as, preferably, over the course of the reaction.<br>
For example, the catalyst may be added over a period of time to ensure<br>
the presence of catalyst at a sufficient level throughout the process cycle.<br><br>
The solvent can be the alcohol or a suitably inert solvent. There is<br>
no specific limitation for the solvent, so far as it is inert to the silicon metal,<br>
catalyst and alcohol. However, stable solvents having a relatively high<br>
boiling temperature are preferred. Solvents transparent to microwave<br>
radiation are also preferred.<br>
Examples of solvents include but are not limited to paraffinic<br>
hydrocarbons, such as octane, decane, dodecane, tetradecane,<br>
hexadecane, octadecane, eicosane, alkylbenzene hydrocarbons, such as<br>
diethylbenzene, cymene, butylbenzene, butyltoluehe, octylbenzene,<br>
dodecylbenzene, and the like, and hydrogenated products thereof,<br>
diphenyl, diphenyl ether, monoethyldiphenyl, diethyldiphenyl,<br>
triethyldiphenyl, and hydrogenated products thereof, alkylnaphthalene<br>
hydrocarbons and hydrogenated products thereof, and triphenyl<br>
hydrocarbons and hydrogenated products thereof.<br>
High boiling heat transfer agents include polyaromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, such as, THERMINOL and MARLOTHERM, of which<br>
MARLOTHERM is preferred. These can be used singly or in combination<br>
of two or more thereof.<br>
The reaction can be conducted under an atmospheric, pressurized<br>
or depressurized condition. Reaction under atmospheric conditions is<br>
preferred due to the economic advantage of the simple apparatus.<br>
The reaction is conducted at a temperature, pressure, and length of<br>
time sufficient to form the alkoxysilane. Thus, the preferred temperature is<br>
from about 100 °C to about 300 °C; the preferred pressure is atmospheric<br>
pressure, and the reaction time is from about 1 minute to about 10 hours.<br>
The microwave reaction was carried out in a Milestone Ethos<br>
microwave unit. The Ethos can be configured to run in closed vessel or<br>
open vessel format. Both modes can be used to generate the<br><br>
alkoxysilanes. The Ethos unit was modified to include a pressure monitor,<br>
addition port for alcohol introduction, an entry port for a mechanical stirrer<br>
and an exit port for product collection.<br>
The microwave power level is usually in the range of 200 to 1000<br>
watts in a field from about 3 Hz to 300 GHz. Microwave units<br>
manufactured by other suppliers that are capable of running open and<br>
closed vessels are also appropriate for the reaction with modifications.<br>
The reaction can be run in a batch, semicontinuous or continuous<br>
manner. In the batch reaction, the appropriate alcohol is introduced into<br>
the reaction mixture which is a slurry of metallic silicon and the copper<br>
catalyst and the reaction products are collected and purified.<br>
In the continuous manner, the reaction slurry is continuously passed<br>
through a microwave or RF field. The alcohol and solvent are continuously<br>
recycled into the reaction mixture with product being separated and<br>
purified.<br>
The amount of material that can be produced is limited only by the<br>
size or number of microwave generating units and the process design. In<br>
the continuous process, one preferred approach would be the use of a<br>
multiple number of microwave generators designed in parallel.<br>
The silicon metal and catalyst can be introduced as a slurry or in a<br>
metal/catalyst bed system. The bed system can be designed to allow for<br>
replenishment of the catalyst and silicon metal as necessary. The alcohol<br>
can be introduced in conjunction with the slurry or separately. A recycle<br>
loop can be designed to ensure appropriate residence time to meet<br>
productivity requirements.<br>
. Alternatively, a reactor train can be employed wherein the slurry or<br>
reaction mixture without a fixed bed is pumped through a series of reactors<br><br>
to maximize residence time and productivity. After the appropriate<br>
residence time the reaction mixture is passed through an evaporation unit<br>
where ethanol is flashed off and returned to the feed unit. The reacted<br>
mixture is then transported to a vessel where the products are separated<br>
and purified by distillation.<br>
In both the batch and continuous process the reactor can either be a<br>
traditional glass kettle or a glass tube within a microwave or RF waveguide.<br>
Other materials that are transparent to microwave or RF can be used.<br>
Additionally, the glass reactor can be enclosed within a metal jacket<br>
providing the jacket or this outer reactor does not interfere with<br>
transmission of the microwaves. In either case, the microwave or RF field<br>
generator is part of the reactor.<br>
Depending upon whether or not the reaction mixture is slurried or<br>
the silicon/catalyst are part of a bed type system a filter may need to be<br>
installed to collect solid material prior to the mixture entering the<br>
evaporator. The above referred to evaporator will also require a chiller to<br>
condense the ethanol flashed off which can either be part of the evaporator<br>
or a separate unit.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
alkoxysilane product is distilled to separate a major product from other<br>
minor products or to form a higher purity alkoxysilane.<br>
The unreacted silicon can be recycled and design provisions can be<br>
made to add catalyst throughout the reaction if desired.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, any<br>
unreacted silicon metal or hydroxy compound, if present, is recycled.<br>
In the practice of the process of the present invention, contacting is<br>
preferably carried out to produce at least a 40% conversion, more<br><br>
preferably at least a 70% conversion and, most preferably at least a 95%<br>
conversion.<br>
In still another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
alkoxysilane product is the only product formed or, alternatively, is a<br>
mixture of trialkoxysilane and tetraalkoxysilane wherein the ratio of<br>
trialkoxysilane to tetraalkoxysilane is at least 2:1, more preferably at least<br>
6:1, and most preferably the ratio of trialkoxysilane to tetraalkoxysilane is<br>
at least 9:1.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
contacting is carried out to produce at least a 70% conversion and a ratio<br>
of trialkoxysilane to tetraalkoxysilane of at least 9:1.<br>
The actual number of reactors required would be dependent upon<br>
the production rate. A process that has several smaller units versus one<br>
larger unit would most be preferred. A design which represents a pilot<br>
plant approach rather than a production facility approach as it utilizes<br>
several small vessels to achieve the volume equal to one large unit is<br>
preferred.<br>
The alkoxysilanes according to the. present invention have utility as<br>
coupling agents, in adhesives, sealants, construction materials, coatings,<br>
plastics, fabrics, medical devices, and cosmetics.<br>
Example 1<br>
A three necked 1 liter round bottom flask inside a Milestone Multi-<br>
Syn Ethos Microwave chamber was fitted with a condenser and receiver, a<br>
mechanical stirrer, and nitrogen and ethanol inlet ports. All glassware was<br>
oven dried at 80C and dried when set up using a heat gun and nitrogen<br>
flush. To the dried apparatus was added 20 grams (0.714 moles) of finely<br>
ground (200 mesh) silicon metal, 0.85 grams (1.66 mole %) of cuprous<br>
oxide, 1.17 grams (1.66 mole %) of cuprous chloride, 0.75 grams (1.66<br><br>
mole %) of copper powder and 500ml of Marlotherm SH. The mixture was<br>
vigorously stirred to form a slurry. The microwave unit power source was<br>
turned on with an initial power level of 975 watts and the mixture was<br>
exposed to the microwave until a temperature of 190°C was achieved (22<br>
minutes). The microwave power level was subsequently adjusted (335 -<br>
1000 watts) over the course of the reaction to maintain the temperature at<br>
approximately 190°G. Once the reaction mixture reached 190°C,<br>
anhydrous ethanol was metered in at a rate of 8.1 milliliters/minute using a<br>
peristaltic pump. Immediately, liquid began to distill from the reaction flask<br>
with an average head temperature of 95°C. The reaction was continued<br>
until 1.5 liters of ethanol were added (185 minutes). Excess ethanol and<br>
the desired product, triethoxysilane co-distilled from the reaction mixture.<br>
The product composition was analyzed by Si-NMR spectroscopy. Silicon<br>
conversion was determined by filtering the reaction mixture and repeatedly<br>
washing the collected solid residue with hot water, acetone and diethyl<br>
ether. The silicon conversion was calculated to be 87%. Selectivity<br>
calculated from the silicon conversion was determined to favor<br>
triethoxysilane by 100%.<br>

minutes). The microwave power level was subsequently adjusted (300 -<br>
1000 watts) over the course of the reaction to maintain the temperature at<br><br>
approximately 190°C. Once the reaction mixture reached 190°C,<br>
anhydrous ethanol was metered in at a rate of 8.1 milliliters/minute using a<br>

ground (200 mesh) silicon metal, 3.56 grams (5 mole %) of cuprous<br>
chloride and 500ml of Marlotherm SH. The mixture was vigorously stirred<br>
to form a slurry. The microwave unit power source was turned on with an<br>
initial power level of 975 watts and the mixture was exposed to the<br>
microwave until a temperature of 190°C was achieved (17 minutes). The<br>
microwave power level was subsequently adjusted (375 - 1000 watts) over<br>
the course of the reaction to maintain the temperature at approximately<br>
190°C. Once the reaction mixture reached 190°C, anhydrous ethanol was<br>
metered in at a rate of 7.7 milliliters/minute using a peristaltic pump.<br>
Immediately, liquid began to distill from the reaction flask with an average<br>
head temperature of 95°C. The reaction was continued until 1.5 liters of<br>

ground (200 mesh) silicon metal, 3.56 grams (5 mole %) of cuprous<br>
chloride and 500ml of Mariotherm SH. The mixture was vigorously stirred<br>
to form a slurry. The microwave unit power source was turned on with an<br>
initial power level of 975 watts and the mixture was exposed to the<br>
microwave until a temperature of 190°C was achieved (20 minutes). The<br>
microwave power level was subsequently adjusted (600 - 1000 watts) over<br>

was metered in at a rate of 7.9 milliliters/minute using a peristaltic pump,<br>
immediately, liquid began to distill from the reaction flask. The reaction<br>
was continued until 1.5 liters of ethanol were added (189 minutes). Excess<br>
methanol and the desired product, trimethoxysilane co-distilled from the<br>

power of up to 950 W, this taking approximately 19 minutes. The<br>
microwave power level was subsequently adjusted (385 - 1000 watts) over<br>
the course of the reaction to maintain the temperature at approximately<br>
190°C. Once the reaction reached 190°C anhydrous ethanol was metered<br>
in at a rate of 8.0 milliliters per minute using a peristaltic pump.<br>
Immediately liquid was observed to distill from the reaction flask with an<br>
average head temperature of 95°C. The reaction was continued until 1.5<br>
liters of ethanol were added (187 minutes). The resulting distillate was<br>
collected and analyzed by Si-NMR spectroscopy for the presence of<br>
