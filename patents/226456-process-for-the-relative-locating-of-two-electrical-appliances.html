				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to process for the relative locating<br>
of two electrical appliances.<br>
It is sometimes desirable to ensure that two electrical appliances<br>
are plugged into the same domestic electrical network, in particular when one<br>
wishes to ensure that they are located in the same residence.<br>
For example, when a service provider - for example a provider of<br>
video content - offers a second subscription at reduced price on condition<br>
that the same residence already benefits from a first subscription, one wishes<br>
to be able to verify that the two electrical appliances (each benefiting from<br>
one of the subscriptions) are actually at the same residence, that is to say on<br>
the same domestic electrical network.<br>
It has long been known how to benefit from the fact that electrical<br>
appliances share the same electrical network in order to facilitate their<br>
interaction, as described, for example, in US Patent 3,882,392.<br>
It is known, in particular, to make the electrical appliances of one<br>
and the same domestic electrical network hold a dialogue with one another<br>
by virtue of the technology of carrier currents, as isHTeseribetr nr Patent &gt;<br>
Application WO 98/18211.	(|<br>
The possibility of making two. appliances communicate by carrier<br>
currents does not however make it possible to ensure thaffrTe Wo'appliances<br>
are in the same residence. Specifically, when the two domestic networks are<br>
not separated by a transformer, communication from one network to the<br>
other is possible if no particular provision for isolation is made (reference may<br>
be made in this regard to Patent Application WO 2001/54297). .<br>
The invention is therefore aimed at ensuring thatftwo electrical<br>
appliances)share the same residence (and hence the same domestic<br>
electrical fietwpjJc), regardless of the configUfaTibrY of the neighbouring<br>
networks, provided that the domestic electrical network is plugged into a<br>
circuit breaker (which ought always to be the case).<br>
With this aim, the invention proposes a process for the relative<br>
locating of a first electrical appliance plugged into a first part of an electrical<br>
network and a second electrical appliance plugged into a second part of the<br>
electrical network comprising the following steps:<br>
- measurement of a first number of alternations or of electrical<br>
periods on the said first part by the first electrical appliance from the<br>
energizing of the said first part and up to transmission of a signal by the first<br>
electrical appliance;<br><br>
-	measurement of a second number of alternations or of electrical<br>
periods on the said second part by the second electrical appliance from the<br>
energizing of the said second part and up to receipt of a signal from the first<br>
electrical appliance;<br>
-	comparison of the first number with the second number.<br>
Advantageously, exchange of the first number or of the second<br>
number is performed by a communication between the first electrical<br>
appliance and the second electrical appliance. The communication is, for<br>
example, a communication by carriercurrents.<br>
In this case, the said signal may correspond to the start signal for<br>
the communication.<br>
When it is applied, this process generally comprises a step<br>
posterior to the said comparison whose nature depends on the difference<br>
between the first number and the second number.<br>
In a preferred manner,<br>
-	the transmission of the said signal takes place after a specified<br>
duration determined by the first electrical appliance;<br>
-	the specified duration lies between 1 s and 20 s;<br>
-	the specified duration has-at least one random or pseudo-<br>
random component.<br>
Viewed from a first electrical appliance, the invention proposes a<br>
process for locating this first electrical appliance plugged into a first part of an<br>
electrical network relative to a second electrical appliance plugged into a<br>
second part of the electrical network comprising the following steps:<br>
-	measurement of a first number of alternations or of electrical<br>
periods on the said first part by the first electrical appliance from the<br>
energizing of the said first part and up to the start of a communication with<br>
the second electrical appliance;<br>
-	receipt by the first electrical appliance of a second number of<br>
alternations or of electrical periods on the said second part measured by the<br>
second electrical appliance from the energizing of the said second part to the<br>
start of communication;<br>
-	comparison of the first number with the second number.<br>
Stated otherwise, the invention proposes a process for the relative<br>
locating of a first electrical appliance plugged into a first part of an electrical<br>
network and a second electrical appliance plugged into a second part of the<br>
electrical network comprising the following steps:<br><br>
-	measurement according to a specified criterion of a first<br>
characteristic related to the electrical signal on the first part by the first<br>
electrical appliance;<br>
-	measurement according to the said criterion of a second<br>
characteristic related to the electrical signal on the second part by the second<br>
electrical appliance;<br>
-	comparison of the first characteristic with the second<br>
characteristic.<br>
In a particularly advantageous application, the invention proposes<br>
a process for decrypting a digital content by a first electrical appliance<br>
plugged into a first part of an electrical network, a second electrical appliance<br>
being plugged into a second part of the electrical network, comprising the<br>
following steps:<br>
-	measurement according to a specified criterion of a first<br>
characteristic related to the electrical signal on the first part;<br>
-	measurement according to the said criterion of a second<br>
characteristic related to the elecrical signal on the second part;<br>
-	comparison of the first characteristic with the second<br>
characteristic;<br>
-	decryption if and only if the result of the comparison is positive.<br>
Provision may be made for the result of the comparison to be<br>
positive if and only if the first characteristic is equal to the second<br>
characteristic or that the result of the comparison is positive if and only if the<br>
first characteristic differs from the second characteristic by less than a<br>
predetermined tolerance value.<br>
The process can also comprise a step of exchange of the first<br>
characteristic or of the second characteristic by a communication by carrier<br>
currents.<br>
For this application, the first electrical appliance and the second<br>
electrical appliance are, for example, digital decoders.<br>
Other characteristics of the invention will become apparent in the<br>
light of the description of an exemplary embodiment of the invention given<br>
with reference to the appended figures, where<br>
-	Figure 1 represents a first embodiment of the invention;<br>
-	Figure 2 diagrammatically represents the operation of the<br>
modules at Figure 1;<br>
-	Figure 3 is a flow chart of the operation of the modules of<br>
Figure 1;<br><br>
-	Figure 4 represents a variant embodiment of Figure 3;<br>
-	Figure 5 represents a second embodiment of the invention.<br>
In a first exemplary embodiment of the invention, represented in<br>
Figure 1, the electrical appliances are a first carrier currents module 10 and a<br>
second carrier currents module 20. One wishes to verify that these two<br>
modules 10, 20 are located on the same domestic electrical nelwork 1 for<br>
example before permitting them to exchange secure information with one<br>
another.<br>
Each module 10, 20 is plugged into the domestic electrical<br>
network 1 by means of a respective socket 4, 6. Each module 10, 20<br>
comprises a microprocessor 12, 22, a modem 14, 24, a power supply 16, 26<br>
and a filter 18, 28.<br>
The power supplies 16, 26 are in fact converters that deliver DC<br>
voltages to the microprocessor 12, 22 and the modem 14, 24 from the AC<br>
"mains" voltage present on the domestic electrical network 1.<br>
In each module.the microprocessor 12, 22 is linked to the modem<br>
14, 24 by a bus; the modem 14, 24 is for its part linked across the filter 18, 28<br>
to the domestic electrical network 1 which is used by the modem 14, 24 as<br>
information transmission line.<br>
The filter 18, 28 also possesses an electrical output intended for a<br>
measurement pin 11, 21 of the microprocessor 12, 22 and representative of<br>
the electrical voltage present at the input of the filter 18, 28, that is to say the<br>
electrical voltage present at each instant on the domestic electrical network 1<br>
at the level of the socket 4, 6 where the module 10, 20 is plugged in.<br>
The domestic electrical,network 1 is connected to the public<br>
network 3 by way of a circuit breaker 2 and therefore carries in, particular an<br>
AC power voltage provided by the generator 8 of the public network 3. It is,<br>
for example, an AC voltage of nominal value 220 V with a frequency of<br>
50 Hz.<br>
The process for verifying the location of the electrical appliances,<br>
here carrier current modules, begins with the re-energizing of the domestic<br>
electrical network 1, in general deliberate energizing (closure of the circuit<br>
breaker 2) after a deliberate tripout by means of the circuit breaker 2.<br>
Through this new deliberate energizing, the user thus launches the<br>
verification procedure represented diagrammatically in Figures 2 and 3 and<br>
described in detail hereinbelow.<br>
For each microprocessor 12, 22, the return of the mains voltage<br>
(voltage of the domestic electrical network 1) and hence of the DC voltage<br><br>
provided by the respective power supply 16, 26, launches a reinitialization<br>
procedure. This reinitialization procedure implements (very quickly, that is to<br>
say in a few µs) an interrupt subprogram which counts down the number of<br>
periods of the electrical signal at the level of the socket 4, 6 where the<br>
module 10, 20 is plugged in, by virtue of the signal received by the pin 11, 21.<br>
The interrupt subprogram increments a counter with each period of the mains<br>
voltage.<br>
In the first module 10, the counting down of the electrical periods<br>
takes place for a specified duration t1. This specified duration t1 may be a<br>
pre-specified duration, a pseudo-random duration or the sum of a pre-<br>
specified duration and of a pseudo-random duration. In general, this duration<br>
t1 will be chosen of the order of a few seconds (that is to say large relative to<br>
that of a period, here 20 ms).<br>
At the end of the duration t1, the value N of the counter of the<br>
periods for the first module 10 is stored and the microprocessor 12 seeks to<br>
enter into communication with other modules by virtue of the modem 14 by<br>
the. transmission over the domestic electrical network 1 of a start of<br>
communication signal.<br>
In the second module 20, the counting down of the electrical<br>
periods takes place up to receipt by the microprocessor 22 of the start of<br>
communication signal. Specifically, as soon as the microprocessor 22<br>
receives the start of communication signal by way of the modem 24, it stores<br>
the value M of the counter of the periods, then it responds to the start of<br>
communication signal from the microprocessor 12 of the first module 10 so<br>
as to establish a communication (or dialogue) between the first module 10<br>
and the second module 20.<br>
The set-up time for establishing the communication t2 is typically<br>
of the order of 2 to 3 ms and may therefore be neglected relative to the<br>
duration of a period (around 20 ms); a signal other than the start of<br>
communication could moreover be used, the important thing being to trigger<br>
the stoppage of counting on the second module.<br>
Once the communication has been established, the second<br>
module 20 sends the number M of periods that it has measured to the first<br>
module 10.<br>
The first module 10 then compares the number of periods M<br>
measured by the second module 20 with the number of periods N measured<br>
by itself.<br><br>
If the two modules 10, 20, are actually on the same domestic<br>
electrical network (as is represented in Figure 1), the number of periods<br>
measured between the re-energizing and the end of the countdown (almost<br>
common for the two modules) will be identical for the two modules 10, 20.<br>
On the other hand, if the two modules 10, 20 are plugged into two<br>
different domestic networks, then in order to obtain a common result in the<br>
two modules, it would be necessary for the respective circuit breakers to be<br>
reset at instants separated by less than 20 ms, this being impossible in<br>
practice.<br>
If the number of periods N measured by the first module 10 is<br>
equal to the number of periods M measured by the second module 20<br>
(condition N=M), the two modules 10, 20 are therefore regarded as plugged<br>
into the same domestic electrical network and thus, for example, as being<br>
able to exchange secure data.<br>
On the other hand, if the measurements of the number of periods<br>
give different results (N different from M), then the two modules 10, 20 are<br>
regarded as being located on different domestic networks; it is then, for<br>
example, possible to prohibit any posterior communication between the two<br><br>
modules.<br>
According to a first variant embodiment of the invention<br>
represented in Figure 4, when the second module 20 has communicated its<br>
countdown M to the first module 10, the first module 10 communicates its<br>
countdown N to the second module 20. (Of course, the exchange of<br>
countdowns may, in a similar manner, take place in the reverse order.)<br>
According to this first variant, each module 10, 20 compares the<br>
two countdowns N and M on its side and interrupts its operation if N is<br>
different from M. Of course, if N is equal to M, one has verified that the two<br>
modules 10, 20 are on the same domestic electrical network and their<br>
operation can therefore continue normally.<br>
According to a second variant embodiment (which may be<br>
combined with the first variant), the condition N = M is replaced with a more<br>
flexible condition, for example:<br>
-M-N = 0orM-N = 1;<br>
-1 M - N | 
According to this second variant embodiment, the two modules 10,<br>
20 are regarded as being on the same domestic electrical network if their<br>
respective countdowns of periods differ little (are equal to within a period in<br>
the examples given). This makes it possible to take account of the possible<br><br>
differences in duration of energization from one module to the other, as well<br>
as of the set-up time t2 for establishing the communication.<br>
However, the tolerated difference between the two countdowns<br>
must remain small (preferably 1 period, that is to say i = 2 in the example<br>
above) so as to always distinguish the cases where two circuit breakers each<br>
having a module on its network are closed at very similar instants.<br>
Hitherto, the embodiments described implement a link of<br>
essentially the master/slave type between the two modules 10, 20;<br>
specifically, the first module 10 determines the instant of stoppage of the<br>
countdown (after the time t1) and then orders the stoppage of the countdown<br>
in the second module 20 (by a start of communication signal).<br>
According to a third variant embodiment of the invention (which<br>
may also be combined with the previous variants), the role of the two<br>
modules 10, 20 in the stoppage of the countdown is symmetric. According to<br>
this variant, there is provision for each module 10, 20 to determine a<br>
countdown duration t1, t1' preferably having a pseudo-random component<br>
and to measure the number of mains periods over this duration t1, t1' unless<br>
interrupted by a start of communication signal generated by the other module<br>
20, 10.<br>
The counting down of the periods will therefore take-place over the<br>
shorter of the two durations t1, t1' and the module which generated in<br>
pseudo-random manner the shorter duration will be the one which will initiate<br>
the communication phase.<br>
Figure 5 describes an application of the invention to the<br>
verification of the siting of two digital decoders, for example when the second<br>
digital decoder benefits from a subscription at reduced price on condition that<br>
it is located in the same residence as the first digital decoder, that is to say in<br>
practice that it is plugged into the same domestic electrical network.<br>
A first digital decoder 30 is plugged into a socket 5 of the domestic<br>
electrical network 1. In proximity, a first carrier currents module 10 of the type<br>
described in Figure 1 is plugged into a socket 4. The first digital decoder 30 is<br>
moreover linked to the first module 10 by way of a standard serial link 56, for<br>
example of the RS232 type.<br>
In a similar manner, a second digital decoder 40 is plugged into a<br>
socket 7 of the domestic electrical network 1. In proximity, a second carrier<br>
currents module 20 is plugged into a socket 6. The second digital decoder 40<br>
is linked to the second module 20 by a serial link 58.<br><br>
Each digital decoder 30, 40 comprises a video processing circuit<br>
34, 44 which receives a modulated and encrypted signal from an antenna 50<br>
and generates a video signal destined for a respective television 52, 54.<br>
Each digital decoder 30, 40 also possesses a microprocessor 32, 42 which<br>
receives the serial link originating from the respective module 10, 20. The<br>
microprocessor 32, 42 of each digital decoder 30, 40 is also linked to the<br>
video processing circuit 34, 44 and to a chip card reader 38, 48.<br>
The first digital decoder 30 reads (secret) information from the chip<br>
card inserted into the reader 38, this information allowing the decryption of<br>
the signal received from the antenna 50 into a video signal by the video<br>
processing circuit 34.<br>
The second digital decoder 40 benefits from a reduced<br>
subscription: the™ card Inserted into the reader 48 will not allow the decryption<br>
of the signal received from the antenna 50 unless it is verified that the second<br>
digital decoder 40 is located on the same domestic electrical network as the<br>
first digital decoder 30.<br>
This verification is performed by the modules 10 and 20 as<br>
described in the first embodiment of the invention. When the verification is<br>
positive, the modules 10 and 20 (and therefore the digital decoders which are<br>
linked to each of them) can exchange information which allows decryption in<br>
the second digital decoder 40.	i<br>
An exemplary implementation is as follows: provision may be<br>
made for the second digital decoder 40 (reduced subscription) to need a part<br>
(at least) of the secret of the card located in the first digital decoder 30 (main<br>
subscription) to decrypt the content that it receives.<br>
The principal steps necessary before any decryption by the<br>
second digital decoder 40 are in this case the following:<br>
-	closure of the circuit breaker 2 (by the user who wishes to profit<br>
from the second subscription at reduced price in his residence);<br>
-	simultaneous counting down of the periods of the mains voltage<br>
in the first module 10 and in the second module 20;<br>
-	stoppage of the countdown in the first module 10 and<br>
transmission of a signal to the second module 20;<br>
-	receipt of the signal by the second module 20 and immediate<br>
stoppage of the countdown in the second module 20;<br>
-	sending of the countdown from the second module 20 to the first<br>
module 10;<br><br>
-	comparison of the countdown of the second module 20 with the<br>
countdown of the first module 10;<br>
-	in case of inequality, end of the communication;<br>
-	in case of equality, request to the first decoder 30 by the first<br>
module 10 for the part of the secret, receipt of the part of the secret by the<br>
first module 10, sending of the part of the secret from the first module 10 to<br>
the second module 20, sending of the part of the secret from the second<br>
module 20 to the second decoder 40.<br>
The part of the secret may be stored in the second module 20 or in<br>
the second decoder 40 in a volatile memory so as to disappear as soon as<br>
the appliance which stores it is unplugged from the mains (i.e. from the<br>
domestic electrical network 1).<br>
All the indicated variants relative to the first embodiment are of<br>
course applicable to the embodiment just described.<br>
Additionally, provision may be made for the first module 10 to form<br>
an integral part of the first digital decoder 30. Likewise, the second module<br>
20 can form part of the second digital decoder 40. The power supplies 36, 46<br>
and the microprocessors 32, 42 of the digital decoders30,40then<br>
advantageously fulfil the functions of the; power supplies 16, 26 and of the<br>
microprocessors 12, 22 of the modules 10, 12. Connection to a single mains<br>
socket 5, 7 is then sufficient for each decoder/module assembly and the<br>
serial link which linked the microprocessors (12 and 32 on the one hand, 22<br>
and 42 on the other hand) disappears.<br>
The above examples have proposed countdowns and a<br>
comparison of the number of periods of the electrical signal; by way of<br>
variant, it is of course possible to measure and compare the number of<br>
alternations (i.e. of half-periods) of the electrical signal.<br>
Although the technique of communications by carrier currents is<br>
particularly suited to the context of the invention so as to effect<br>
communication between the two electrical appliances (in particular the<br>
sending of the number of periods or of alternations), it is also possible to<br>
implement the invention using other means of communication between the<br>
two electrical appliances, for example a local area network (of the computing<br>
network type).<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
