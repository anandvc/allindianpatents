				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for preparation of coffee-chicory extract.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of coffee-chicory extracts from blends of roasted and ground (R&amp;G) coffee and R&amp;G chicory wherein the chicory content varies from l0-40g%. The extracts containing 20-28g% soluble solids may be used, after suitable dilution, in the preparation of coffee beverage either as black coffee or with milk and sugar. Apart from this, the extracts can also be used in the manufacture of confectioneries such as coffee toffees and carbonated coffee beverages.<br>
It is well known that coffee brew is generally prepared either by soaking R&amp;G coffee in hot water and filtering or passing hot water through R&amp;G coffee taken in a conventional filter. By these methods an aroma-rich coffee brew may be obtained but the efficiency of extraction is very low resulting in a dilute extract of 4-6°Brix. However, to obtain an extract with higher brix the quantity of R&amp;G coffee has to be more and water used for extraction less. This will amount to increased cost and may not be economically viable, as   the  efficiency  of extraction  will   be     poor.      The   use    of    R&amp;G<br>
coffee blended with finely powdered chicory in different proportions is also known wherein the extracts obtained separately are used to make such blends which possess more soluble solids than those from pure coffee. The coffee-chicory extracts are thicker (better body) provide less coffee aroma to the coffee beverage. These extracts possess a very short storage life of a few hours only after which they lose their aroma, become stale and also are prone to microbial spoilage.<br>
A few patents relevant but different to the present invention use a multistage extraction of coffee volatiles first, non-volatiles next through pressure extraction followed by addition of chicory to the spent coffee and extracting again and finally compounding all the extracts to obtain a consolidated coffee-chicory extract. Reference may be made to UK Pat.No. 1583344,1981. Reference may be made to Japanese Pat. No. 156969,1977 wherein a two stage extraction process of extracting the volatiles at low temperature (50-80°C), adding chicory to the spent coffee and extracting with water at l00-120°C followed by combining the two extracts and adding asolution of furfuryl mercaptan to the extract to obtain coffee-chicory extract with boosted coffee flavor .<br>
The former patent (UK No 1583344,1981) uses a three step extraction unit. Here the first extract containing the more volatile constituents of coffee and the coffee-chicory extract obtained through the third step are mixed together. Since this extract is diluted it is subjected to a concentration step, which causes loss of aroma in the extract. The pressure extraction in the second step also results in hydrolysis enabling more non-volatiles to be extracted which provides body but not aroma. In the second patent, (Japanese No 156969,1977) the first and second extraction at low and high temperatures respectively result in a dilute extract (coffee to water ratio being high) and also a flavor enhancer such as furfuryl mercaptan is added which affects the naturalness' of the coffee extract. An earlier work of Central Food Technological Research Institute (Ann.Report,1978-79,p.no 54) relates to the extraction of R&amp;G coffee using a battery of percolators (75-80°C) whereby extract concentration of 30% could be obtained.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a single step process for the preparation of coffee-chicory extract.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of coffee-chicory extract having full body and natural aroma.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an economical process.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved process for preparation of coffee-chicory extract by simultaneous extraction of coffee and chicory solids which comprises blending roasted and grounded coffee cherry having particle size 700 - 900p. with 10 - 40% (w/w) chicory, wetting and hot conditioning the said blend at a temperature ranging 85 -90°C a period ranging 15 - 45 minutes, extracting with hot water at a temperature at least 85°C, wherein the water: blend is in the ratio at the range of 0.9 : 1 to 1.2 : 1 (w/w), percolating the hot water in blend allowing a contact time in the range of 15 - 30 minutes followed by eluting , repeating the percolation with hot water to get 40 - 60% extract, adding a food preservative such as sodium borate to the obtained extract and flushing with an inert gas such as carbon di-oxide to get the desired extract.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the coffee beans used may be such as robusta cherry, arabica cherry and arabica plantation or mixture thereof.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, roasted coffee and chicory used may be of particle size in the range 700 -900n.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, wetting of coffee-chicory blend may be effected for the period of 15-30 minutes at ambient temperature.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the food preservatives used may be such as sodium benzoate.<br>
The present invention relates to the achievement of a concentrated coffee-chicory extract by a simplified process, without sacrificing the overall aroma and flavour quality of the extract. It is very much different from hitherto known processes in that it employs an extraction system which extracts maximum soluble solids under the conditions employed in a single operation. Since no hydrolysis of<br>
water solubles are there during extraction, the extract retains full body and rich flavour.<br>
The process consists in roasting green coffee beans: arabica plantation, robusta cherry and arabica cherry, preparing blends of these roasted beans, grinding, mixing with chicory powder and then extracting the solubles in a single step. During roasting, the bulk density of the beans decreases from 0.4-0.7 to 0.28-0.36 g/ml due to a weight loss of 12 to 20%. The blend of roasted beans is powdered coarse and wetted with an aqueous liquid. The wet powder is allowed to be conditioned for 15-30 min. at ambient temperature (27°C) when the bulk density increases to 0.42 to 0.48 g/ml. The wet R&amp;G coffee is then subjected to extraction. The bed of coffee is kept hot at a temperature in the range 85-90°C by passing steam for a period of 30-45 min. Hot aqueous extraction liquid (85-95°C) is allowed to percolate until the first few drops of the extract are sighted in a receiver thereafter allowing a contact time of 15-30 min. The extract is then collected in a receiver. Once again hot aqueous extraction liquid is let into the percolator and after a similar contact time, the extract is collected in the receiver.    The above<br>
operation is repeated once more until a total of 40-60% extract is collected. The extract has a fine coffee aroma. The extract is preserved with the addition of a preservative such as sodium benzoate and flushed with an inert gas such as carbon dioxide. The applicability of the process is further illustrated in the following examples, however this should not be construed to limit "' the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
A coffee blend (5kg) consisting of roasted arabica plantation and robusta cherry in the ratio 4:1 was ground to a particle size of 800u and wetted with 3 L water and kept at room temperature for 30 minutes. The wetted powder was subjected to hot conditioning for 45 minutes at a temperature of 90°C. Then 5 L of hot water (90°C) was added to the hot conditioned blend and 30 minutes contact time was allowed. Extract was eluted slowly so as to collect IL of the extract. Then again 2.5 L of hot water was added and the extract was eluted after 30 minutes of contact time. Finally IL hot water was added and after allowing a contact time of 30 minutes, the remaining extract<br>
was eluted. All the fractions of the extract were pooled together and 2.5g of sodium benzoate was added to the bulk. A 5 L coffee extract was obtained with total soluble soilds (TSS) of 17 g% and pH 5.0. The extract had a good colour, bitterness and a rich coffee aroma.<br>
Example 2<br>
A coffee blend (5kg) containing roasted beans of robusta cherry,<br>
arabica cherry and arabica plantation in the ratio of 5:3:2 was ground<br>
to a particle size of 800 u   and wetted with 3 L  water and kept at<br>
room temperature for 30 minutes. The wetted powder was subjected<br>
to hot conditioning for 45 minutes at a temperature of 90°C. Then 5<br>
L of hot water (90°C) was added to the hot conditioned blend and 30<br>
minutes contact time was allowed. Extract was eluted slowly so as<br>
to collect 1L of the extract. Then again 2.5 L of hot water was added<br>
and the extract was eluted after 30 minutes of contact time. Finally<br>
1L hot water was added and after allowing a contact time of 30<br>
minutes, the remaining extract was eluted. All the fractions of the<br>
extract were pooled together and 2.5g of sodium benzoate was added<br>
to the bulk. A 5 L  coffee extract was obtained with a good colour,<br>
bitterness and a pleasant coffee aroma. .<br>
Example 3<br>
R&amp;G coffee blend ( any of the given in examples 1 and 2) was mixed with R&amp;G chicory. The chicory content in the coffee-chicory mixture was 20(w/w)%. The blend was wetted and then and was subjected to hot conditioning for 45 minutes at a temperature of 90°C. Then 5 L of hot water (90°C) was added to the hot conditioned blend and 30 minutes contact time was allowed. Extract was eluted slowly so as to collect IL of the extract. Then again 2.5 L of hot water was added and the extract was eluted after 30 minutes of contact time. Finally 2.5L hot water was added and after allowing a contact time of 30 minutes, the remaining extract was eluted. All the fractions of the extract were pooled together and 2.5g of sodium benzoate was added to the bulk. A 5 L coffee-chicory extract was obtained with a dark brown colour,sourness and a mild /pleasant coffee aroma. The extract was slightly acidic (pH 4.8) and at total soluble solids 24g%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
