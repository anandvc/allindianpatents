BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the composition of a novel lead-free solder alloy.<br>
In our co-pending application no. IN/PCT/99/00078 from which this application has<br>
been divided out, we have described and claimed a process for preparing a lead-free<br>
solder alloy.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In the solder alloy, lead has been conventionally an important metal for diluting<br>
tin to improve flow factor and wettability. Obviating the use of lead, a toxic, heavy<br>
metal, is preferred in consideration of working environments in which soldering<br>
operation is performed, operating environments in which soldered products are used,<br>
and the earth friendly to which solder is released. Avoiding the use of lead in solder<br>
alloy is thus noticeable practice.<br>
When a lead-free solder alloy is formed, the alloy is required to have wettability<br>
to metals to be soldered. Tin having such wettability is an indispensable metal as a base<br>
material. In the formation of a lead-free solder alloy, it is important to fully exploit the<br>
property of tin and to determine the content of an additive metal for the purpose of<br>
imparting, to the lead-free solder alloy, strength and flexibility as good as those of the<br>
conventional tin-lead eutectic alloy.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a lead-free solder<br>
alloy having tin as a base material with other additive materials that are easily gettable<br>
as good as the conventional tin-lead eutectic alloy, and offers a stable and liable solder<br>
joint.<br>
To achieve the object of the present invention, the solder alloy is<br>
preferably formed of three metals of 0.1-2 weight percent (hereinafter wt%) Cu,<br>
0.002-1 wt% Ni and the remaining wt% Sn. Of these elements, tin has a melting<br>
point of about 232°C, and is an indispensable metal to impart wettability of the<br>
alloy against the metals to be soldered. A tin-based alloy, without lead of a large<br>
specific gravity, is light in its molten state, and cannot offer enough flowability to<br>
be appropriate for a nozzle-type soldering operation. The crystalline structure of<br>
such solder alloy is too soft and not mechanically strong enough. By additive of<br>
copper the alloy reinforces strongly. The addition of approximately 0.7% copper<br>
added to tin forms an eutectic alloy having a melting point of approximately<br>
227°C, which is lower than that of tin alone by approximately 5°C. The addition<br>
of copper restrains copper leaching in which copper, a typical base material of lead<br>
wire, leaches out of the surface of the lead wire in the course of soldering<br>
operations. At a soldering temperature of 260°C, for example, the copper<br>
leaching rate of the copper-added alloy is half as high as the copper leaching rate<br>
in the tin-lead eutectic solder. Restraining the copper leaching reduces a copper<br>
density difference present in a soldering area, thereby slowing the growth of a<br>
brittle compound layer.<br>
The addition of copper is effective to prevent a rapid change in<br>
composition in the alloy itself when using a long period on a dipping method.<br>
The optimum amount of additive copper is within a range of 0.3-0.7 wt%,<br>
and if more copper is added, the melting temperature of the solder alloy rises.<br>
The higher the melting point, the higher the soldering temperature needs to be. A<br>
high soldering temperature is not preferable to thermally weak electronic<br>
components. Typical soldering temperature upper limit is considered to be 300°C<br>
or so. With the liquidus temperature of 300°C, the amount of additive copper is<br>
about 2 wt%. The preferable value and limits are set as the above.<br>
In the present invention, not only a small amount of copper is added to tin<br>
as a base material, but also 0.002-1 wt% nickel is added. Nickel controls<br>
intermetallic compounds such as Cu6Sn5 and Cu3Sn, which are developed as a<br>
result of reaction of tin and copper, and dissolves the developed compounds. As<br>
such intermetallic compounds have a high temperature melting point, they hinder<br>
flowability of milting solder and make solder function declined. Therefore, if<br>
these intermetallic compounds remain on patterns at a soldering operation, these<br>
become to be so-called bridge that shorts conductors. Namely, needle-like<br>
projections remains when leaving from melting solder. To avoid such problems,<br>
nickel is added. Although nickel itself produces intermetallic compound with tin,<br>
copper and nickel are always solid soluble at any ratio. Therefore, nickel<br>
cooperates with the development of Sn-Cu intermetallic compounds. Since the<br>
addition of copper to tin helps the alloy to improve its property as a solder<br>
compound in the present invention, a large amount of Sn-Cu intermetallic<br>
compounds is not preferable. For this reason, nickel, in an all-ratio solid soluble<br>
relationship with copper, is thus employed to control the reaction of copper with<br>
tin.<br>
The liquidus temperature rises if nickel is added because a melting point<br>
of nickel is high. In consideration of the typical permissible upper temperature<br>
limit, the amount of additive nickel is limited to 1 wt%. It was learned for an<br>
inventor that the amount of additive nickel as low as or greater than 0.002 wt%<br>
held a good flowability and solderability showed a sufficient strength of a soldered<br>
joint. According to the present invention, a lower limit of the amount of additive<br>
nickel is thus 0,002wt%<br>
In the above process, Ni is added to the Sn-Cu alloy. Alternatively, Cu<br>
may be added to an Sn-Ni alloy. When nickel alone is slowly added to tin,<br>
according to the raising up of a melting point, the flow factor drops in its molten<br>
state by reason of producing intermetallic compounds. By adding copper, the<br>
alloy has a smooth property with an improved flow factor but some degree of<br>
viscosity. In either process, the interaction of copper and nickel helps create a<br>
preferable state in the alloy. The same solder alloy is therefore created not only<br>
by adding Ni to the Sn-Cu base alloy but also by adding Cu to the Sn-Ni base<br>
alloy.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, a range of 0.002-1 wt% nickel and a range of 0.1-2<br>
wt% copper result in a good solder joint. When the base alloy is Sn-Cu, the<br>
content of copper represented by the X axis is limited to a constant value within a<br>
range of 0.1-2 wt%. If the content of nickel is varied within a range of 0.002-1<br>
wt% with the copper content limited to within a range of 0.1-2 wt%, a good solder<br>
alloy is obtained. When the base alloy is Sn-Ni, the content of nickel represented<br>
by the Y axis is limited to a constant value within a range of 0.002-1 wt%. If the<br>
content of copper is varied within a range of 0.1-2 wt%, a good solder alloy is<br>
obtained. These ranges remain unchanged even if an unavoidable impurity,<br>
which obstructs the function of nickel, is mixed in the alloy.<br>
Germanium has a melting point of 936°C, and dissolves in only a trace<br>
amount into the Sn-Cu alloy. Germanium makes the crystal finer when the alloy<br>
solidifies. Germanium appears on a grain boundary, preventing the crystal from<br>
becoming coarse. The addition of germanium prevents oxide compounds from<br>
developing during the solution process of the alloy. However, the addition of<br>
germanium in excess of 1 wt% not only costs much, but also makes an<br>
oversaturation state, hindering the molten alloy from spreading uniformly.<br>
Excess germanium above the limit does more harm than good. For this reason,<br>
the upper limit of the content of germanium is thus determined.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is a graph showing proper ranges of additive metals.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The physical properties of solder alloys having the composition of the present<br>
invention are listed in Table. The alloy of 0.6 wt% Cu, 0.1 wt% Ni, and the remaining<br>
percent Sn, which the inventors consider one of the proper compositions of solder alloy,<br>
was prepared.<br>
Melting point:<br>
Its liquidus temperature was approximately 227°C and its solidus temperature<br>
was approximately 227°C. Tests were conducted using a differential<br>
thermal analyzer at a temperature rise rate of 20° C/minute.<br>
Specific gravity:<br>
The specific gravity of the alloy, measured using a specific gravity meter, was<br>
approximately 7.4.<br>
Tensile test under a 25°C room temperature atmosphere:<br>
The tensile strength of the alloy was 3.3 kgf/mm2 with a stretch of approximately<br>
48%. The conventional Sn-Pb eutectic solder alloy, tested under almost the same<br>
conditions, exhibited a strength of 4-5 kgf/mrn2• The alloy of the present invention has a<br>
tensile strength lower than that of the conventional solder alloy. However, considering that<br>
the solder alloy of, the present invention is<br>
chiefly intended to solder relatively light-weight electronic components onto a<br>
printed circuit board, the solder alloy of the present invention meets strength<br>
requirement as long as the application is limited to this field.<br>
Spreading test:<br>
The alloy, measured under JIS (Japanese Industrial Standards) Z3197 Test<br>
Standard, exhibited 77.6% at 240°C, 81.6% at 260°C, and 83.0% at 280°C.<br>
Compared with the conventional tin-lead eutectic solder, the solder alloy of the<br>
present invention offers a small spreading factor, but is still sufficiently acceptable.<br>
Wettability test:<br>
A copper strip of 7 x 20 x 0.3 mm was subjected to acid cleaning using<br>
2% diluted hydrochloric acid and was tested for wettability under the conditions of<br>
a dipping rate of 15 mm/second, a dip depth of 4 mm, and a dipping time of 5<br>
seconds, using a wettability test apparatus. The zero crossing time and maximum<br>
wetting force of the alloy were 1.51 seconds and 0.27 N/m at 240°C, 0.93 second<br>
and 0.3 N/m at 250°C, 0.58 second and 0.33 N/m at 260°C, and 0.43 second and<br>
0.33 N/m at 270°C. From these results, the start of wetting is late at higher<br>
melting points, compared with the eutectic solder, but the wetting speed increases<br>
as the temperature rises. Since the metals to be soldered have typically low heat<br>
capacity in practice, the delay of the start of wetting presents no problem.<br>
Peel test:<br>
QFP lead peel tests showed a peel strength of approximately 0.9 kgf/pin.<br>
A visual check to the peeled portion revealed that all peelings took place between<br>
a board and a copper land. This showed that the solder joint had a sufficient<br>
strength.<br>
Electric resistance test:<br>
A wire solder of 0.8 mm diameter and 1 meter long was measured using<br>
the four-terminal measurement method. Its resistance was 0.13µ O . The<br>
resistance of the wire solder was close to that of tin. A low resistance increases<br>
the velocity of propagation of electrons, improving high-frequency characteristics,<br>
and changing acoustic characteristics. Measured under the same conditions, a<br>
tin-lead eutectic solder alloy had an electric resistances of 0.17µ O and a tin-<br>
silver-copper solder had an electric resistance of 0.15µ O.<br>
Creep strength test:<br>
A tin-plated brass pin having a 0.8 x 0.8 mm square cross section was<br>
flow-soldered onto a land of a 3 mm diameter with a hole of a diameter of 1 mm<br>
formed on a paper phenolic board. A weight of 1 kg was hung on the pin using a<br>
stainless steel wire in a temperature-controlled bath until the pin dropped out of the<br>
solder joint. With the bath temperature at 145°C, the pin remained connected<br>
over 300 hours. At 180°C, the pin did not fall even after 300 hours had passed.<br>
The pin connected by the tin-lead eutectic solder joint dropped within several<br>
minutes to several hours under the same conditions. Different from the Pb<br>
including solder, the solder alloy of the present invention has resistance to creep<br>
even if its tensile strength is low, and the reliability of the solder alloy of the<br>
present invention is particularly excellent under the high-temperature atmosphere.<br>
Heat shock test:<br>
An hour of heat shock at -40°C and +80cC was given to the solder alloy.<br>
The solder alloy withstood 1000 cycles of shocks. The conventional tin-lead<br>
eutectic solder alloy withstood 500-600 cycles of shocks.<br>
Migration test:<br>
A type II comb-like test specimen specified JIS Standard was dip-soldered<br>
using RMA flux. Flux residues are cleaned, and resistance was measured with a<br>
terminal attached to a lead wire. This measurement result was treated as an initial<br>
value. The test specimen was introduced into a thcrmohygrostat, and rated direct<br>
currents were applied for 1000 hours to measure resistance at predetermined time<br>
intervals while the test specimen was observed using a magnifier with a<br>
magnification of 20 times. No abnormal change was observed both when 100<br>
VDC current was applied at 40°C and a humidity of 95% and when 50 VDC<br>
current was applied at 85°C and a humidity of 85%. This means that the alloy of<br>
the present invention performed as well as the conventional tin-lead eutectic<br>
solder.<br>
Leaching test:<br>
A copper wire of 0.18 mm diameter with RA type flux attached thereto<br>
was dipped in a solder bath filled with molten solder at 260±2°C. The copper<br>
wire was agitated until it disappeared by leaching, and the time to the full leaching<br>
was counted using a stopwatch. The full leaching of the copper wire in the solder<br>
of the present invention took about 2 minutes while the identical copper wire<br>
leached in the tin-lead eutectic solder for about 1 minute. It is apparent that the<br>
longer resistance to the leaching was attributed to the addition of an adequate<br>
amount of copper. Specifically, the originally added copper that had leached<br>
resulted a relatively slow copper leaching rate regardless of a large content of tin.<br>
Another likely reason for the slow leaching rate was that the melting point of the<br>
solder was higher than the eutectic solder by approximately 40°C.<br>
The melting point and strength of the alloy having another composition is<br>
listed in Table.<br>
Studying the above tests results, compared with a comparative example,<br>
all examples of the present invention present satisfactory results. The<br>
conventional tin-lead eutectic solder alloy, measured under the same conditions,<br>
exhibited a strength of 4-5 kgf/mm2. All examples exhibited strength values<br>
lower than that of the conventional tin-lead eutectic solder alloy. As already<br>
described, the solder alloy of the present invention is chiefly intended to solder<br>
relatively light-weight electronic components onto a printed circuit board, and the<br>
solder alloy of the present invention meets strength requirement as long as the<br>
application is limited to this field.<br>
No particular data were taken about the spreading of the samples. The<br>
addition of nickel imparted a smooth surface structure to the alloy itself. Since<br>
the smooth surface was maintained after solidification, the spreading was<br>
considered good.<br>
The melting point are represented by two temperatures, in which a lower<br>
one is a solidus temperature while a higher one is a liquidus temperature. The.<br>
smaller the temperature difference between the two, the less a component to be<br>
soldered moves during solder solidification prior to the soldering operation, and<br>
the stabler the solder joint. This is also true of the conventional tin-lead solder.<br>
However, which solder outperforms which is not generally determined.<br>
Depending on the application of solder, a solder alloy having an adequate<br>
temperature difference may be employed.<br>
Wettability to the copper, one of the important characteristics of solder, is<br>
good with the RMA type flux. A good wettability is thus assured using the RMA<br>
type flux.<br>
The three-element Sn-Cu-Ni solder of the present invention may be<br>
progressively formed by preparing the Sn-Ni base alloy and mixing a molten Sn-<br>
Cu solder with the base alloy for uniform diffusion. As already described, the<br>
melting point of nickel is high. When pure nickel is introduced into the Sn-Cu<br>
alloy, dissolving and diffusing nickel uniformly is difficult. To prepare the alloy<br>
of the present invention, the base alloy is beforehand melted at a relatively high<br>
temperature so that nickel is sufficiently mixed with tin, and the base alloy is then<br>
introduced into the molten Sn-Cu bath. In this way, the lead-free solder alloy in<br>
which nickel is diffused into tin at a relatively low temperature is obtained.<br>
Forming beforehand the Sn-Ni base alloy helps prevent other unwanted<br>
metals from being included thereinto. The present invention takes advantage of<br>
the fact that nickel is in an all-ratio solid soluble relationship with copper and that<br>
the alloy of copper and nickel controls the development of bridges. The presence<br>
of any metal in the alloy that hinders the function of nickel is not preferred. In<br>
other words, the addition of any metal other than copper, which may easily<br>
cooperate with nickel is not preferred in the present invention.<br>
Although the lead-free solder of the present invention suffers a slow start<br>
of wetting because of a melting point higher than that of the conventional tin-lead<br>
eutectic solder, the lead-free solder of the present invention forms an interfacial<br>
alloy layer quickly and reliably in accordance with a variety of surface processes<br>
once the wetting starts. The lead-free solder alloy of the present invention has a<br>
creep strength high enough to support bulky and heavy components and heat-<br>
generating components. Since the copper leaching, which is considered serious<br>
in the conventional solder alloy, is alleviated, the durability of lead wires is<br>
substantially increased.<br>
Because of its high electric and thermal conductivities, the lead-free solder<br>
of the present invention imparts high-speed property and high heat dissipation<br>
property to electric components, and improves acoustic characteristics of electric<br>
components.<br>
Since the lead-free solder of the present invention does not include, in its<br>
composition, bismuth, zinc, and indium, it is free from an abnormal reaction with a<br>
coating containing lead that is soluble from a terminal materials, other lead-free<br>
solder coating such as Sn-Ag solder, Sn-Bi solder, and Sn-Cu solder. This means<br>
that the continuous use of a solder bath is assured and lead-rich wires compatible<br>
with lead are used without any problem when the conventional tin-lead solder is<br>
switched to the lead-free solder alloy of the present invention.<br>
We claim,<br>
1. A lead-free solder alloy comprising 0.3 to 0.7 wt% Cu, 0.04 to 0.1 wt%<br>
Ni, optionally 0.001 to 1.0wt% Ge, and the remaining percent Sn.<br>
2. A lead-free solder alloy according to claim 1, wherein the Ni is added to<br>
a solved base alloy of Sn-Cu.<br>
3. A lead-free solder alloy according to claim 1, wherein the Cu is added to<br>

percentage of Cu and Ni are 0.3 to 0.7 percent and 0.04 to 0.1 percent respectively.<br>
Both methods of additive Ni to a base alloy of Sn-Cu and additive Cu to a base<br>
alloy of Sn-Ni are applicable.</td>
