In accordance with this invention a pedal operated tile making machine has a vibrating platform which is mounted at the top of the main frame. The vibrating platform is vibrated by a vibrating lever secured rotatably with the main frame below the vibrating platform. A wheel is secured with a crank shaft for rotating the vibrating lever so as to provide the vibration to the vibrating platform. A crank shaft is secured to main frame rotatably. A pair of wooden pedal secured with the bottom of the main frame are connected to the crank shaft through the connecting rods, and provided for rotating the crank shaft. A support rope is provided with each of the pedals so as to keep the pedals in its position of operation. A tile frame is provided over the vibrating platform for keeping the material therein during the vibrating operation of the vibrating platform and to provide outer boundaries to a tile.<br>
Detailed Description regarding the Present Invention<br>
The pedal operated tile making machine according to a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein;<br>
Fig. 1 shows the perspective view of the tile making machine<br>
Fig. 2 shows the perspective view of the tile making machine without top<br>
Fig. 3 shows the plan view of the tile making machine<br>
Fig. 4 shows the side plan view of the tile making machine<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly Fig 1, a pedal operated tile making machine has a vibrating platform (1) mounted at the top (2) of the main frame (3) such that to be vibrated by a vibrating lever (4) provided there under. The vibrating platform (1) is supported on the top (2) through the springs (5) (see fig 4) and bolts (6). The vibrating platform (1) is vibrated by a vibrating lever (4) secured rotatably with the main frame (3) below the vibrating platform (1). A vibrating lever (4) is rotated on a shaft (7) which is secured with the main frame (3) below the vibrating platform (1). A wheel (8) is mounted on a crank shaft (9) such that to rotate the vibrating lever (4) for providing vibration action to the vibrating platform (1). The crank shaft (9) is supported with the main frame (3) rotatably. A pair of wooden pedal (10) is supported with the bottom of the main frame (3) at one side such that to provide rotational movement to the crank shaft (9). The pedals (10) are connected to the crank shaft (9) through the connecting rods (11). The pedals are operated at the free ends thereof. A support rope (12) is provided with each of the pedals (10) so as to keep the pedals in its position during operation. A tile frame (13) is provided with the vibrating platform (1) for keeping the material within its boundary during the vibrating operation of the vibrating platform (1) and to provide outer boundaries to a tile. A hook (14) is attached to the tile frame for fixing and producing holding/supporting hook with the tile<br>
During the operation of the device, pedals are operated by the operator and thus the crank having the wheel mounted thereon is rotated. Due to the rotation of the wheel the vibrating lever starts rotating at its own axis so as to provide a pushing action to the vibrating platform continuously in order to vibrate the same so as to remove the air bubbles from the tile material. An extension is provided with the tile sheet with the help of metallic hook die. The cement sheet so prepared within the boundaries of tile frame is then removed and put on to a precasted tile, so as to provide the shape of the precasted tile to the cement sheet. The tile so manufactured is cured for two-three days in the shade but not in sun light directly. The dried tiles so obtained are then put into water for further curing.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
