				<td>COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK FOR DISTRIBUTED<br>
SENSING AND THERAPY IN BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates generally to implantable medical device systems and, in<br>
particular, to a communications network for use with implantable sensing and/or therapy<br>
delivery devices organized in a distributed, mesh network.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A wide variety of implantable medical devices (IMDs) are available for monitoring<br>
physiological conditions and/or delivering therapies. Such devices may includes sensors<br>
for monitoring physiological signals for diagnostic purposes, monitoring disease<br>
progression, or controlling and optimizing therapy delivery. Examples of implantable<br>
monitoring devices include hemodynamic monitors, ECG monitors, and glucose monitors.<br>
Examples of therapy delivery devices include devices enabled to deliver electrical<br>
stimulation pulses such as cardiac pacemakers, implantable cardioverter defibrillators,<br>
neurostimulators, and neuromuscular stimulators, and drug delivery devices, such as<br>
insulin pumps, morphine pumps, etc.<br>
IMDs are often coupled to medical leads, extending from a housing enclosing the<br>
IMD circuitry. The leads carry sensors and/or electrodes and are used to dispose the<br>
sensors/electrodes at a targeted monitoring or therapy delivery site while providing<br>
electrical connection between the sensor/electrodes and the IMD circuitry. Leadless IMDs<br>
have also been described which incorporate electrodes/sensors on or in the housing of the<br>
device.<br>
IMD function and overall patient care may be enhanced by including sensors<br>
distributed to body locations that are remote from the IMD. However, physical connection<br>
of sensors distributed in other body locations to the IMD in order to enable<br>
communication of sensed signals to be transferred to the IMD can be cumbersome, highly<br>
invasive, or simply not feasible depending on sensor implant location. An acoustic body<br>
bus has been disclosed by Funke (U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,859) to allow wireless bidirectional<br>
communication through a patient's body. As implantable device technology advances,<br>
and the ability to continuously and remotely provide total patient management care<br>
expands, there is an apparent need for providing efficient communication between<br>
implanted medical devices distributed through a patient's body or regions of a patient's<br>
body, as well as with devices.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention is directed to providing a communications network<br>
implemented in an implantable medical device system, wherein the network is configured<br>
as a mesh network that allows data to be routed between implanted and external devices as<br>
needed via continuously available connections established through node-to-node routes<br>
that can include multiple node "hops." In the following description, references are made<br>
to illustrative embodiments for carrying out the invention. It is understood that other<br>
embodiments may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. For<br>
purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers are used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term "module" refers to an application specific<br>
integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated, or group)<br>
and memory that execute one or more software or firmware programs, a combinational<br>
logic circuit, or other suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
As used herein, the term "node" refers to a device included in a wireless mesh<br>
network capable of at least transmitting data on the network and may additionally include<br>
other functions as will be described herein. Each "node" is a "network member" and these<br>
terms are used interchangeably herein. A node can be either an implanted or an external<br>
device. The wireless mesh network generally includes multiple implantable devices each<br>
functioning as individual network nodes in a mesh architecture and may include external<br>
devices functioning as equal network nodes as will be further described herein. It is<br>
recognized that an overall medical device system implementing a mesh communication<br>
network may further include non-networked devices (implantable or external).<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of a wireless communication network<br>
implemented in an implantable medical device system. The wireless communication<br>
network is characterized by a mesh architecture that allows multi-hop communication<br>
across network nodes. The network includes multiple implantable devices 12 through 26<br>
each functioning as a node (network member). The network may further include external<br>
devices functioning as equal nodes. Patient 10 is implanted with multiple medical devices<br>
12 through 26 each of which may include physiological sensing capabilities and/or therapy<br>
delivery capabilities. As will be further described herein, some of the implanted devices<br>
12 through 26 may be implemented as specialty nodes for performing specific network<br>
functions such as data processing, data storage, or communication management functions<br>
without providing any physiological sensing or therapy delivery functions.<br>
For example, device 12 may be a therapy delivery device such as a cardiac<br>
pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, implantable drug pump, or<br>
neurostimulator. Device 16 may also be a therapy delivery device serving as a two-way<br>
communication node and may further be enabled for performing specialty network<br>
management functions such as acting as a network gateway. Device 14 may be embodied<br>
as a sensing device for monitoring a physiological condition and also serve as a two-way<br>
communication node. Devices 18, 22,24, and 26 may be embodied as sensing devices for<br>
monitoring various physiological conditions and may be implemented as low-power<br>
devices operating primarily as transmitting devices with no or limited receiving<br>
capabilities. Device 20 may be implemented as a repeater node for relieving the power<br>
requirement burden of sensing device 18 for transmitting data from a more remote implant<br>
location to other network nodes. The mesh network is an n-dimensional network wherein<br>
node depth may be defined spatially with respect to proximity to a specialized node, such<br>
as a node incorporating gateway, data processing or data storage capabilities.<br>
Implantable devices that may be included as mesh network members include any<br>
therapy delivery devices, such as those listed above, and any physiological sensing devices<br>
such as EGM/ECG sensors, hemodynamic monitors, pressure sensors, blood or tissue<br>
chemistry sensors such as oxygen sensors, pH sensors, glucose sensors, potassium or other<br>
electrolyte sensors, or sensors for determining various protein or enzyme levels. The mesh<br>
network communication system provided by various embodiments of the present invention<br>
is not limited to any specific type or combination of implantable medical devices.<br>
The mesh network communication system allows a multiplicity of devices to be<br>
implanted in a patient as dictated by anatomical, physiological and clinical need, without<br>
restraints associated with leads or other hardwire connections through the body for<br>
communicating signals and data from one device taanother. As such, sensors and/or<br>
therapy delivery devices may be implanted in a distributed manner throughout the body<br>
according to individual patient need for diagnostic, monitoring, and disease management<br>
purposes. Data from the distributed system of implanted sensors and/or therapy delivery<br>
devices is reliably and efficiently transmitted between the implanted devices for patient<br>
monitoring and therapy delivery functions and may be transmitted to external devices as<br>
well for providing patient feedback, remote patient monitoring etc.<br>
The implanted devices 12 through 26 may rely on various power sources including<br>
batteries, storage cells such as capacitors or rechargeable batteries, or power harvesting<br>
devices relying for example on piezoelectric, thermoelectric or magnetoelectric generation<br>
of power. The mesh network allows management of communication operations to be<br>
performed in a way that minimizes the power burden on individual devices (nodes) and<br>
can eliminate functional redundancies within the overall system. The distributed devices<br>
can be provided having minimal power requirements and thus reduced overall size.<br>
Implantable devices functioning as network nodes may be miniaturized devices such as<br>
small injectable devices, devices implanted using minimimally invasive techniques or<br>
mini-incisions, or larger devices implanted using a more open approach.<br>
The mesh network may include external devices as shown in Figure 1 such as a<br>
home monitor 30, a handheld device 34, and external monitoring device 36. Reference is<br>
made to commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. 6,249,703 (Stanton e al.) regarding a handheld<br>
device for use with an implantable medical device, hereby incorporated herein by<br>
reference in its entirety. The medical device system may further include external devices<br>
or systems in wireless or wired communication with external mesh networked devices<br>
such as a patient information display 32 for displaying data retrieved from the mesh<br>
network to the patient, and a remote patient management system 40. Physiological and<br>
device-related data is available to any device (node) included in the mesh network, and<br>
aggregated data can be used to provide short-loop feedback to the patient or caregiver via<br>
the home monitor 30 and patient information display 32. The home monitor 30, in this<br>
illustrative example, includes RF receiver and long range network functionality allowing<br>
data received from the implanted network nodes to be accumulated and prioritized for<br>
further transmission to the remote patient management system 40 and/or patient<br>
information display 32. The patient can respond appropriately to information retrieved<br>
from the mesh network and displayed on patient information display 32 in accordance<br>
with clinician instructions. A patient may respond, for example, by modifying physical<br>
activity, seeking medical attention, altering a drug therapy, or utilizing the handheld<br>
device 34 to initiate implanted device functions.<br>
Data can also be made available to clinicians, caregivers, emergency responders,<br>
clinical databases, etc. via external or parallel communication networks to enable<br>
appropriate and prompt responses to be made to changing patient conditions or disease<br>
states. Aggregated data can be filtered, prioritized or otherwise adjusted in accordance<br>
with patient condition and therapy status to provide clinically meaningful and useful<br>
information to a clinician or remote patient management system in a readily-interpretable<br>
manner. The home monitor 30 may function as a network administration node receiving<br>
patient and device-related data from the implanted nodes in a continuous, periodic, or<br>
triggered manner and managing transmissions of the aggregated data to other networks or<br>
devices. Reference is made to commonly-assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,599,250 (Webb et al.),<br>
6,442,433 (Linberg et at.) 6,622,045 (Snell et al.), 6,418,346 (Nelson et al.), and 6,480,745<br>
(Nelson et al.) for general descriptions of network communication systems for use with<br>
implantable medical devices for remote patient monitoring and device programming, all of<br>
which are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
Home monitor 30 and/or a programmer may be used for communicating with one<br>
or more of implanted devices 12 through 26 using bidirectional RF telemetry for<br>
programming and/or interrogating operations. Reference is made to commonly-assigned<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 6,482,154 (Haubrich et al.), hereby incorporated herein by reference in its<br>
entirety, for an example of one appropriate long-range telemetry system for use with<br>
implantable medical devices.<br>
The mesh architecture allows network communication between nodes to make<br>
multiple hops. Communication paths between nodes illustrated in Figure 1 are only<br>
examples of some of the shortest pathways existing between adjacent nodes.<br>
Communication paths will exist between each node and every other node in the network.<br>
Multiple hops may be made between nodes, in accordance with individual node roles,<br>
node power status, channel plan and routing scheme, each of which will be further<br>
described herein.<br>
The mesh network is a self-configuring network in which all nodes are initially<br>
equal status, i.e. the nodes do not function in a master-slave relationship as provided in<br>
other kinds of networking schemes. As used herein, the terms "self-configuration" and<br>
"reconfiguration" refer to the network's ability to automatically adjust node roles and<br>
assignments, the network channel plan, and the network routing scheme, all of which will<br>
be further described below. "Primary" node functions, as used herein, generally refers to<br>
device functions relating to patient care such as physiological sensing or therapy delivery<br>
functions, whereas the term "network" functions refers generally to roles, assignments or<br>
tasks that the device performs as part of the mesh communication network. Some network<br>
nodes will be enabled to perform only network functions without any primary sensing or<br>
therapy delivery functions.<br>
Initially, the network will enter a learning mode during which the network<br>
members learn about all other network members. Each node includes memory allocated<br>
for storing a preliminary network rule set. The rule set defines communication priorities<br>
and may provide a preliminary channel plan. During the learning mode, individual nodes<br>
are assigned tasks or network functions based on the node functional capacity and power<br>
capacity relative to other network members, the node primary function and the preliminary<br>
network rules. Each node learns the functions performed by other nodes and begins to<br>
take on specialist roles as the network learns about the overall group functionality and<br>
membership. Node roles will be described in greater detail below.<br>
A communications routing scheme is formed based on patient status and the power<br>
status of each node. The routing scheme prioritizes data communications such that data<br>
relating to clinically significant events or conditions is given priority over data that does<br>
not have immediate or serious impact on the patient's well-being.<br>
New nodes may be introduced at any time with the network performing a self-<br>
configuring re-learning process to grow "organically" and thereby incorporate the new<br>
node and adjust node roles and the routing scheme as appropriate. As such, a patient may<br>
initially be implanted with nodes functioning as sensing devices used to monitor<br>
physiological conditions for diagnostic purposes. After a diagnosis is made, a treatment<br>
plan may involve implanting one or more therapy delivery devices. When a new therapy<br>
delivery device is added, the network will perform a re-learning process to adjust node<br>
roles and the routing scheme to maintain node communication priorities and optimal<br>
communications reliability and efficiency in accordance with the governing or an adjusted<br>
network rule set. As new nodes are added, the new nodes would seamlessly integrate into<br>
the network. In order to do this, the network membership, the existing network rule set and<br>
the node's primary function and power source would be factored into a new operating rule<br>
set, new pecking order between nodes, new node roles, new routing scheme and new<br>
channel plan.<br>
The mesh network is a self-healing network. Nodes may drop out of the network,<br>
for example, due to power loss, deactivation, or removal from the patient. Sensing devices<br>
implanted for diagnostic purposes may be removed as the patient enters a treatment plan<br>
with new therapy delivery devices being implanted. Sensing or therapy delivery devices<br>
may be replaced by newer models or models having expanded capabilities. When a node<br>
is removed from the network, either physically or functionally, a self-healing process will<br>
reconfigure the node roles, channel plan, and routing scheme.<br>
An initial network rule set stored in the memory of each node at initiation of the<br>
network may be altered or reconfigured externally through a designated communications<br>
channel by a network administrator or authorized personnel using an external<br>
programming device. An external change to the network rules will re-trigger the learning<br>
process such that all node roles and the routing scheme are redefined according to the new<br>
rules, current patient conditions and the power status of individual nodes.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of one example of a mesh communication network<br>
including multiple implantable medical devices. An implantable cardiac stimulation<br>
device 60 is coupled to a patient's heart by a lead 61. In addition to components such as<br>
sensing circuitry, pulse generator circuitry, and timing and control modules typically<br>
included in a cardiac stimulation device, device 60 includes a battery as a power source for<br>
network communications, memory for storing network rules, and a wireless transceiver for<br>
bidirectional communication on the mesh network. Additional network nodes include<br>
distributed sensors 64,66 and 68. Sensors 64, 66, and 68 may be physiological sensors for<br>
monitoring blood pressure, blood or tissue chemistry, blood flow, or other biological<br>
signals at various implant locations. Sensors 64, 66, and 68 each include a power source<br>
(which may be a storage device such as rechargeable battery or capacitor, an energy<br>
harvesting device, or a stand-alone battery), a physiological sensor, and a transmitter or<br>
transceiver for communicating on the mesh network. Sensors 64,66, and 68 may be<br>
implanted at various targeted monitoring sites without the limitations normally associated<br>
with lead-based sensors. However, it is recognized that network node devices may include<br>
lead-based as well as leadless devices.<br>
Device 62 is embodied as a specialized network node for performing network tasks<br>
such as data processing and storage. Device 62 is provided without primary physiological<br>
sensing or therapy delivery capabilities. As such device 62 generally includes a power<br>
source, a processor for executing communication operations, a memory for storing<br>
network rules and patient and device data, and a transceiver for communicating on the<br>
mesh network. Device 62 may receive data from sensors 64, 66, 68 as well as cardiac<br>
stimulation device 60 and perform data processing algorithms, transmit results back to the<br>
cardiac stimulation device for use in therapy control, transmit results to an external device<br>
(node), store data for future transmission to an external device, etc. Device 62 allows<br>
hardware and functional redundancies such as data processing capabilities and storage to<br>
be removed from the networked system, thereby allowing a reduction in the size and<br>
power requirements of other individual nodes. As such, sensors 64, 66, and 68 may be<br>
miniaturized and execute primary sensing functions with minimal or no data processing<br>
and storage. Sensed data is transferred to device 62 for processing, storing or transmission<br>
to other network nodes.<br>
Figure 3 is a conceptual diagram depicting the specialized roles that may be<br>
assigned to network nodes. Network node 100 represents any implanted device included<br>
as a member of the mesh network. Node 100 is configured to primarily perform<br>
physiological sensing and/or therapy delivery functions 102. In addition to the primary<br>
sensing and/or therapy delivery functions 102, node 100 may be assigned specialized<br>
network tasks. Examples of specialized network tasks are illustrated in Figure 3 and<br>
include, but are not limited to, network police 104, gateway 106, data processing 108,<br>
repeater 110, storage 112, scheduler 114, and housekeeper 116. In some embodiments,<br>
implanted device 100 may be implemented solely for purposes of performing specialized<br>
network functions without being configured to perform primary sensing or therapy<br>
delivery functions 102. Other specialist node roles may include an "algorithm workhorse"<br>
node for performing complex, processing power intensive algorithms and a "local<br>
coordinator" for coordinating communication operations within localized clusters or<br>
neighborhoods of nodes.<br>
A node assigned the role of police node 104 is provided for monitoring<br>
inappropriate behavior of any of the network members. Inappropriate behavior includes,<br>
for example, excessive communications in terms of frequency and/or data size, erroneous<br>
data generation, or other "deviant" behaviors. The police node 104 may be configured to<br>
have the authority to reconfigure a node which is determined to be functioning<br>
inappropriately on the network. The reconfiguration may include temporarily or<br>
permanently disabling the node as a network member, logically isolating the data<br>
communications from the deviant node by flagging messages with a logical identifier,<br>
allowing data to be removed from aggregated data upstream, or reassigning the node to a<br>
low priority in the routing scheme and channel plan. The primary, non-network functions<br>
of the deviant node may remain unchanged such that any sensing or therapy delivery<br>
operations may continue according to normal device operation. In some embodiments, the<br>
police node may have the authority to also alter the primary, non-network functions, for<br>
example if inappropriate device function is suspected, the police node may be authorized<br>
to temporarily or permanently suspend or alter primary device functions. Alternatively the<br>
police node may issue a notice of the suspected inappropriate function which is channeled<br>
through the network to allow patient and/or clinician notification.<br>
An implanted node functioning as a gateway node 106 is assigned the task of<br>
coordinating communications with another network or device outside of the mesh<br>
network. The gateway node 106 may schedule, select and prioritize data being transmitted<br>
to an external network or device. The gateway node 106 may be authorized to take control<br>
over one or more channels for external or special data transmissions and communicate to<br>
other network members that those channels are temporarily unavailable. The gateway<br>
node 106 will execute translation, security or other protocols required for transferring data<br>
to another network. The gateway node may have a larger power source, longer<br>
communication range, and connectivity with other network technologies such as WiFi<br>
802.11, ZigBee 802.15.4, Bluetooth, CDMA, GSM, etc. If a gateway node is not present<br>
or assigned by the network membership, then individual nodes may be enabled to<br>
communicate with external networks or devices as needed. The ability to communicate to<br>
external devices/networks may be a programmable parameter for each node, and can be<br>
adjusted dynamically as the network changes.<br>
A data processor node 108 is a node configured with greater power capacity and/or<br>
processing power than other network members. Data processor node 108 may be assigned<br>
processing tasks for other network members or the network as a whole to relieve the<br>
power and processing burden of other individual network members. Data processor node<br>
108 may be provided with the processing power to execute complex, power-intensive<br>
algorithms that are difficult to implement in smaller-sized nodes.<br>
A repeater node 110 provides "shortcut" connectivity to remote nodes. As<br>
discussed previously in conjunction with Figure 1, a node implanted in a "deeper layer" of<br>
the mesh network may transmit data to/from higher layers or specialized nodes via a<br>
repeater node, thereby relieving the power burden placed on a remote node or other<br>
intervening nodes for performing network communications.<br>
A storage node 112 is a node configured with greater memory capacity than other<br>
network members and is assigned the task for storing data received from network<br>
members. Such data may be transmitted from storage node 112 to other network members<br>
as appropriate. For example data processor node 108, gateway node 106, or a therapy<br>
delivery node 102 may send data requests to storage node 112.<br>
A scheduler node 114 may perform network scheduling tasks such as scheduling<br>
data transmissions between implanted and external nodes and scheduling network<br>
"meetings." Network "meetings" may be scheduled when reconfiguration of the node<br>
assignments and roles is needed in response to a change in patient condition, a change in<br>
power status of one or more individual nodes, a change in network membership (a new<br>
node introduced or an existing node removed from the network), or when new network<br>
rules are programmed from an external source. In general, scheduler node 114 is assigned<br>
the task of coordinating network activities that involve all or any subset of network<br>
members. This task of coordinating network activities generally includes "waking up," or<br>
scheduling a "waking up", of all or any subset of network members for performing a<br>
specified activity. Network nodes are generally in a low-power "alert" state that allows<br>
them to be "woken up" by another network node. Upon receiving a "wake-up" signal, the<br>
node converts to a high power "awake" state ready to receive data transmissions or<br>
commands.<br>
A housekeeper node 116 is assigned the task of monitoring the channel plan to<br>
ensure that the plan is efficient and well-organized in terms of the number of nodes and<br>
communication workload assigned to each channel. The housekeeper node 116 ensures<br>
that all members have an up-to-date channel plan and may alter the plan in response to<br>
changes in communication priorities, patient condition and the power status of individual<br>
nodes.<br>
The network roles illustrated in Figure 3 are examples of the types of roles that<br>
individual nodes may be assigned and though these roles have been described in the<br>
context of a node embodied as an implantable device, external devices may also be<br>
assigned specialist node roles. Any one node may include one or more of the roles<br>
depicted and described. The roles included in a mesh communication network<br>
implemented in an implantable medical device system will vary depending on the<br>
particular application. The assignments of those roles can vary over the operating life of<br>
the medical device system as the network performs self-configuring and self-healing<br>
processes in response to changes in network membership, changes in network rules,<br>
changes in patient status, and changes in power status of individual nodes.<br>
Figure 4 is a flow diagram providing an overview of the general operation of a<br>
mesh network implemented in an implantable medical device system. At block 200, a<br>
network rule set is provided and stored in the memory of each system device to be<br>
included in the mesh network. The rule set defines an initial channel plan shared by all<br>
network members and priority communication rules. The rule set may be implemented in<br>
a look-up table and can be altered, adjusted or replaced at any time by a network<br>
administrator.<br>
The rule set may include constant rules and variable rules. The variable rules are<br>
derived during self-configuring processes and are dynamically updated in response to<br>
changing node membership, changes in node operating and power status, and changes in<br>
patient status or as otherwise programmed by a user. The constant rules establish generally<br>
unalterable operating network conditions.<br>
The constant rules may apply to the channel plan (e.g., certain channels may be<br>
emergency-use only or reserved for external communication); message length (to set<br>
baseline for message coexistence and communication success); maximum message<br>
redundancy; maximum/minimum update rate; maximum message repeat level; controls on<br>
maximum mesh depth thereby limiting power usage due to node hopping; pre-defined<br>
pecking order for device/sensor communication; and pre-defined pecking order for<br>
device/sensor power based attributes (e.g., a therapy delivery device having a primary<br>
battery may be assigned a power rating of 10, whereas a simple infrequent sensor may<br>
have a power rating in the 1-3 range in accordance with the power supply for the given<br>
node or device). On infrequent occasions, constant rules included in a rule set may be<br>
altered, for example in order to accommodate next generation nodes implementing a new<br>
operation system or operating system updates.<br>
At block 205, selected devices are implanted in a patient in a distributed manner,<br>
including sensing devices and/or therapy delivery devices and optionally including<br>
specialist node devices (repeaters, data storage, data processors, etc.). When the devices<br>
are positioned within communication proximity to each other, and any external devices<br>
that are enabled to communicate on the mesh network, the mesh network will initiate a<br>
self-configuring process at block 210. All nodes are initially equal entering the learning<br>
process 210. During this process 210, the network "learns" the identities and capabilities<br>
(input block 215) of all of its members. Individual node roles 225, a routing scheme 220,<br>
and a channel plan 230 will be developed and established within the operational<br>
constraints and communication priorities provided by the network rule set and based on<br>
the functionality and power status of each node.<br>
The system operates normally at block 235 carrying on sensing and/or therapy<br>
delivery functions according to programmed operating modes. Data communications on<br>
the mesh network will occur during normal system operation 235 in response to previously<br>
scheduled, triggered, or requested data transmissions in accordance with the established<br>
node assignments, routing scheme and channel plan.<br>
Throughout normal system operation, any change in the network operating<br>
conditions or environment, such changes in individual node status (block 240), network<br>
rule set (block 245), node membership (block 250), or patient status (block 255), can cause<br>
a reconfiguration to occur. Other conditions that may cause the network to reconfigure<br>
may include a clinician- or other user-programmed change to the operating mode or<br>
operating parameters of individual nodes or implementation of a next generation operating<br>
system or software updates applied to the existing nodes. Automatic reconfiguration<br>
occurs by returning to learning process block 210 wherein the current routing scheme 220,<br>
node roles 225 and channel plan 230, variable rules included in the network rule set 200,<br>
and in some cases constant rules included in the network rule set 200, are adjusted "on-<br>
the-fly" to meet current power source capacities, communication priorities, therapy<br>
readiness needs, sensing demand, and data throughput requirements. Although learning<br>
process block 210 and normal operations block 235 are illustrated as two distinct blocks in<br>
Figure 4, the learning process/reconfiguration operations of the network are operating in a<br>
continuous dynamic manner in response to changes in the network operating conditions or<br>
environment.<br>
A change in the status of individual nodes (block 240) can cause dynamic<br>
adjustment of the behavior of each node. Individual node status considers both power<br>
status and operational workload for any primary functions related to sensing and/or<br>
therapy delivery. A change in power status or device workload can result in adjustments<br>
to node roles and assignments as well as altering network communication behavior. A<br>
node can rescind a specialist role as a function of its power status or an increase in its<br>
sensing or therapy workload. Network communication behavior of a node may be altered<br>
in response to a change in node status by reducing communication frequency and/or<br>
reducing message length and content. A node entering a low-power status or reaching<br>
end-of-life may generate messages in a "last gasp" format. Abbreviated messages and<br>
message formatting allows power status and impending node death to be communicated<br>
through the network. Predictive and preemptive reconfigurations of node assignments,<br>
channel plan, and routing scheme for the surviving network membership may be made in<br>
response to such messages.<br>
During normal operation 235, nodes will each maintain routing quality information<br>
summarizing communications success metrics. ThlS routing quality information will be<br>
distributed throughout the network or with specialist nodes on a periodic basis such that a<br>
network reconfiguration may occur if routing quality diminishes. Dynamic optimization<br>
and adaptation algorithms will drive network changes to optimize operational efficiency<br>
and reliability of both local and global mesh network performance.<br>
An external change to the network rule set (block 245) will trigger a<br>
reconfiguration process such that the node roles 225, routing scheme 220, and channel<br>
plan 230 can be redefined in accordance with the new rules.<br>
The network membership (block 250) may change as new devices are introduced<br>
or removed. New devices may be implanted or positioned externally to the patient within<br>
communication proximity (which may be on a "coming and going" basis as the patient<br>
moves about). Existing devices may be removed from the network due to power loss,<br>
deactivation, or physical removal. An existing network may come into contact with a<br>
second mesh network, for example networked external monitoring devices in a hospital<br>
setting, and the networks may merge. As such, a membership change triggers a<br>
reconfiguration process in which the node roles 225, routing scheme 220 and channel plan<br>
230 are adjusted. In some cases, communication with an adjacent network may cause self-<br>
isolation of the mesh network for patient safety and security using, for example, frequency<br>
or time multiplexing or a logical group identification code.<br>
The network may also respond to a change in patient status (block 255).<br>
Communication priorities, power allocations, and device operating status may all change<br>
in response to a change in patient status, which may be an adverse physiological event or a<br>
worsening, improving or changing physiological condition.<br>
Changes in node status, rule set, network membership, and patient status may<br>
occur in unpredictable and frequent manner. The network responds to these changes by<br>
dynamically reconfiguring itself to operate in accordance with the present conditions, even<br>
when these conditions may be rapidly changing.<br>
Figure 4, as well as other diagrams and drawings presented herein are intended to<br>
illustrate the functional operation of the mesh network, and should not be construed as<br>
reflective of a specific form of software or hardware necessary to practice the invention. It<br>
is believed that the particular form of software will be determined primarily by the<br>
particular devices employed in the system. Providing software to accomplish the present<br>
invention in the context of any modern implantable medical device system, given the<br>
disclosure herein, is within the abilities of one of skill in the art.<br>
Figure 5 is a conceptual diagram of a mesh network architecture implemented in an<br>
implantable medical device system. The network 300 is an n-dimensional network<br>
including nodes 301 through 318 embodied as implantable devices arranged within the<br>
three-dimensional space of the patient's body and may include external devices. Fourth<br>
and higher order dimensions are represented by specialized dimensional portal nodes 316<br>
and 318 which function as repeater nodes.<br>
Interior nodes can be considered surface nodes because of their proximity to a<br>
specialist node (gateway, data processor, data storage, etc.). Specialist nodes 301, 302<br>
and 304 having greater power capacity and processing power can be interspersed through<br>
the mesh to provide local "neighborhoods" or clusters of nodes, particularly more remote<br>
clusters of nodes, with local data processing or other services. For example, specialist<br>
node 302 may provide data processing services for adjacent sensor nodes 310,312, 314<br>
and 320. Specialist node 302 may transmit processing results back to sensor nodes 310,<br>
312,314 and 320 as needed thereby providing a short feedback loop. Local specialist<br>
nodes can also reduce redundant device functions and potentially reduce parametric data<br>
collection for neighboring nodes. Interspersed specialist nodes 301, 302, and 304 may<br>
also be assigned the role of "local coordinator" to control communications from remote<br>
"neighborhoods" or clusters of nodes to surface or other specialized nodes. Repeater<br>
nodes 316 and 318 provide shorter pathways from such remote nodes to interior nodes.<br>
Communication pathways exist between all of nodes 301 through 318 with longer<br>
pathways not shown in Figure 5 for the sake of clarity. Some nodes may be implemented<br>
as transmit-only nodes. Transmit-only operation can be supervised by Aloha or other<br>
protocols for minimizing collisions of transmitted data packets. Nodes may be enabled to<br>
alternate between transmit and transceiver modes of operation dynamically as a function<br>
of network operating needs, power status, and patient status.<br>
Node hops or routes used to channel data through the mesh network 300 to a<br>
specialist node, e.g., nodes 301, 302 and 304, are dynamically adjusted in response to the<br>
mesh depth of a transmitting node, data throughput, and operational overhead.<br>
Communication scheduling through long and tortuous routes can be used for low priority<br>
communications or infrequent tasks, reserving shorter more efficient routes for higher<br>
priority communications. Generally higher priority communications will relate to patient<br>
or device-related events or conditions that can impact patient health and safety or<br>
otherwise have an adverse affect on disease state or symptoms.<br>
Communication between nodes can be synchronous or asynchronous and security<br>
measures such as encryption and data splicing can be used to ensure patient privacy and<br>
safety. Nodes can be addressed as an entire group, subset, or individuals. Node groups or<br>
individuals can be reconfigured for network functionality or reprogrammed for adjusting<br>
primary functionality (reprogramming sensing/therapy delivery operating mode or<br>
operating control parameters) from peripheral external nodes by a network administrator.<br>
Network configuration and/or programming data are routed through the mesh to the<br>
appropriate nodes being addressed. The freshness, redundancy, and frequency of data<br>
collection or other data collection and communication operations for network nodes can be<br>
altered or adjusted by addressing reconfiguration/programming commands to node groups<br>
or individuals. Nodes may be reprogrammed to alter primary sensing/therapy delivery<br>
functions in response to changes in patient condition. Nodes may be reconfigured for<br>
network operations to reduce power consumption, e.g. while a patient is hospitalized and<br>
coupled to external monitoring equipment, to limit mesh depth and force shorter<br>
communication pathways or for performing other network optimization operations.<br>
Figure 6 is a conceptual diagram of a channel plan implemented by the mesh<br>
network. The channel plan will include multiple communication channels 1-N which can<br>
be divided according to a frequency, time, or code multiplexing. Operating frequency<br>
options include MICS, MEDS and ISM bands. Multiple nodes may be assigned to each<br>
channel and each node may be assigned to one or more channels. For example, in the<br>
fictional example given, nodes 1, 2 and 3 are assigned to channels 1 and 3; nodes 4 and 5<br>
are assigned to channels 2 and 5, and channel 4 is reserved for node 6. Channel<br>
assignments will be based on prioritization of communications, frequency and size of<br>
communications, and other application specific considerations. Nodes can communicate<br>
concurrently on adjacent or distant channels. Access to a channel will be based on<br>
message priority and patient condition. A node may alternate between open, restricted, or<br>
highly-controlled channels based on message priority and patient status. As described<br>
previously, the channel plan can change dynamically based on network membership,<br>
individual node power status, patient status, or an external adjustment to the network rule<br>
set.<br>
