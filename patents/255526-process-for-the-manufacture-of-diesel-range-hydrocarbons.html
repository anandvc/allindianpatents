				<td>PROCESS FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF DTESEL RANGE HYDRO-<br>
CARBONS<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The invention relates to an improved process for the manufacture of diesel range<br>
hydrocarbons from bio oils and fats with reduced hydrogen consumption. Particu-<br>
larly the invention relates to an improved process for the manufacture of diesel<br>
range hydrocarbons with high selectivity and which process yields a product with<br>
improved cold flow properties concurrently without decreasing diesel yield during<br>
isomerisation.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Environmental interests and an increasing demand for diesel fuel, especially in<br>
Europe, encourage fuel producers to employ more intensively renewable sources<br>
available. In the manufacture of diesel fuel based on biological raw materials the<br>
main interest has concentrated on vegetable oils and animal fats comprising<br>
triglycerides of fatty acids. Long, straight and mostly saturated hydrocarbon<br>
chains of fatty acids correspond chemically to the hydrocarbons present in diesel<br>
fuels. However, neat vegetable oils display inferior properties, particularly ex-<br>
treme viscosity and poor stability and therefore their use in transportation fuels is<br>
limited.<br>
Conventional approaches for converting vegetable oils or other fatty acid deriva-<br>
tives into liquid fuels comprise processes such as transesterification, catalytic hy-<br>
drotreatment, hydrocracking, catalytic cracking without hydrogen and thermal<br>
cracking. Typically triglycerides, forming the main component in vegetable oils,<br>
are converted into the corresponding esters by the transesterification reaction with<br>
an alcohol in the presence of catalysts. The obtained product is a fatty acid alkyl<br>
ester, most commonly fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Poor low-temperature<br><br>
properties of FAME however limit its wider use in regions with colder climatic<br>
conditions. Poor cold flow properties are a result of the straight chain nature of the<br>
FAME molecule and thus double bonds are needed in order to create even bear-<br>
able cold flow properties. Carbon-carbon double bonds and ester groups however<br>
decrease the stability of fatty acid esters, which is a major disadvantage of trans-<br>
esterification technology. Further, Schmidt, K., Gerpen J.V.: SAE paper 961086<br>
teaches that the presence of oxygen in esters results in undesired and higher emis-<br>
sions of NOx in comparison to conventional diesel fuels.<br>
Undesired oxygen may be removed from fatty acids or esters by deoxygenation<br>
reactions. The deoxygenation of bio oils and fats, which mean oils and fats based<br>
on biological material, to hydrocarbons suitable as diesel fuel products, may be<br>
carried out in the presence of a catalyst under controlled hydroprocessing condi-<br>
tions, known as hydrotreating or hydrocracking processes.<br>
During hydrodeoxygenation oxogroups are reacted with hydrogen and removed<br>
through formation of water. The hydrodeoxygenation reaction requires relatively<br>
high amounts of hydrogen. Due to the highly exothermic reactions the control of<br>
reaction heat is extremely important. Unnecessary high reaction temperature, in-<br>
sufficient control of reaction temperature or unnecessary low hydrogen availabil-<br>
ity in the feed stream cause increased formation of unwanted side reaction prod-<br>
ucts and coking of catalyst. Unwanted side reactions, such as cracking, polymeri-<br>
sation, ketonisation, cyclisation and aromatisation decrease the yield and the prop-<br>
erties of diesel fraction. Unsaturated feeds and free fatty acids in triglyceride bio<br>
oils may also promote the formation of heavy molecular weight compounds.<br>
Patents US 4,992,605 and US 5,705,722 describe processes for the production of<br>
diesel fuel additives by conversion of bio oils into saturated hydrocarbons under<br>
hydroprocessing conditions with NiMo and CoMo catalysts. The hydrotreatment<br>
operates at high temperatures of 350-450°C and produces n-paraffins and other<br>
hydrocarbons. The product has high cetane number but poor cold properties,<br><br>
which limit the amount of product that can be blended in conventional diesel fuel<br>
in summer time and prevent its use during winter time. The formation of heavy<br>
compounds with a boiling point above 343 °C was observed, especially when a<br>
fatty acid fraction was used as a feed. A lower limit of 350°C for reaction tem-<br>
perature was concluded as a requirement for trouble-free operation.<br>
A two-step process is disclosed in FI100248 for producing middle distillates from<br>
vegetable oils by hydrogenating fatty acids or triglycerides of vegetable oil origin<br>
using commercial sulphur removal catalysts, such as NiMo and CoMo, to give n-<br>
paraffins, followed by isomerizing said n-paraffins using metal containing<br>
molecule sieves or zeolites to obtain branched-chain paraffins. The hydrotreating<br>
was carried out at rather high reaction temperatures of 330-450°C, preferably<br>
390°C. Hydrogenating fatty acids at those high temperatures leads to shortened<br>
catalyst life resulting from coking and formation of side products.<br>
EP 1 396 531 describes a process containing at least two steps, the first one being<br>
a hydrodeoxygenation step and the second one being a hydroisomerisation step<br>
utilizing counter-current flow principle, and biological raw material containing<br>
fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters serving as the feedstock. The process comprises<br>
an optional stripping step.<br>
Cracking is significant side reaction in isomerisation of n-paraffins. Cracking in-<br>
creases with higher isomerisation conversion (more severe reaction conditions)<br>
and decrease the yield of diesel. The severity of isomerisation conditions (isomer-<br>
isation conversion) controls also the amount of methyl branches formed and their<br>
distance from each other and therefore cold properties of bio diesel fraction pro-<br>
duced.<br>
FR 2,607,803 describes a process for hydrocracking of vegetable oils or their fatty<br>
acid derivatives under elevated pressure to give hydrocarbons and to some extent<br>
acid. The catalyst contains metal dispersed on a support. A high reaction tempera-<br><br>
ture of 370 °C did not result in complete conversion and high selectivity of n-<br>
paraffins. The product formed contained also some intermediate fatty acid com-<br>
pounds.<br>
Water formation during hydrotreatment mainly results from deoxygenation of<br>
triglyceride oxygen by the means of hydrogen (hydrodeoxygenation). Deoxygena-<br>
tion using hydrodeoxygenation conditions is to some extent accompanied by de-<br>
carboxylation reaction path, described below as reaction A, and decarbonylation<br>
reaction path (reaction B1 and B2). Deoxygenation of fatty acid derivatives by<br>
decarboxylation and/or decarbonylation reactions forms carbon oxides (CO2 and<br>
CO) and aliphatic hydrocarbon chains with one carbon atom less than in the origi-<br>
nal fatty acid molecule. Thereafter water-gas-shift reaction may balance the con-<br>
centrations of CO and CO2 (reaction E). Methanation reaction uses hydrogen and<br>
forms H2O and methane if it is active during hydrotreatment conditions (reaction<br>
D). Hydrogenation of fatty acids gives aliphatic hydrocarbons and water (reaction<br>
C). Reaction schemes A - E are described below.<br><br>
The feasibility of decarboxylation varies greatly with the type of carboxylic acid<br>
or derivative thereof used as the starting material. Alpha-hydroxy, alpha-carbonyl<br>
and dicarboxylic acids are activated forms and they are more easily deoxygenated<br>
by decarb-reactions, which mean here decarboxylation and/or decarbonylation.<br>
Linear aliphatic acids are not activated this way and generally they are difficult to<br>
deoxygenate through the decarb-reaction path and they need much more severe<br>
reaction conditions.<br><br>
Decarboxylation of carboxylic acids to hydrocarbons by contacting carboxylic<br>
acids with heterogeneous catalysts was suggested by Maier, W. F. et al:<br>
Chemische Berichte (1982), 115(2), 808-12. Maier et al tested Ni/Al2O3 and<br>
Pd/SiO2 catalysts for decarboxylation of several carboxylic acids. During the reac-<br>
tion the vapors of the reactant were passed through a catalytic bed together with<br>
hydrogen. Hexane represented the main product of the decarboxylation of the<br>
tested compound heptanoic acid.<br>
Patent US 4,554,397 discloses a process for the manufacture of linear olefins from<br>
saturated fatty acids or esters, suggesting a catalytic system consisting of nickel<br>
and at least one metal selected from the group consisting of lead, tin and germa-<br>
nium. With other catalysts, such as Pd/C, low catalytic activity and cracking to<br>
saturated hydrocarbons, or formation of ketones when Raney-Ni was used, were<br>
observed.<br>
Decarboxylation, accompanied with hydrogenation of oxo-compound, is de-<br>
scribed in Laurent, E., Delmon, B.: Applied Catalysis, A: General (1994), 109(1),<br>
77-96 and 97-115, wherein hydrodeoxygenation of biomass derived pyrolysis oils<br>
over sulphided CoMo/y-A1203 and NiMo/y-A1203 catalysts was studied. Di-<br>
ethyldecanedioate was used among others as a model compound and it was ob-<br>
served that the rates of formation of the decarboxylation product, nonane and the<br>
hydrogenation product, decane were comparable under hydrotreating conditions<br>
(260-300 °C, 7 MPa, in hydrogen). The presence of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) in<br>
feed promoted the decarboxylation selectivity compared with zero sulphur in feed.<br>
Different sulphur levels studied however had no effect on the decarboxylation<br>
selectivity of diethyldecanedioate.<br>
Biological raw materials often contain several impurities, such as metal com-<br>
pounds, organic nitrogen, sulphur and phosphorus compounds, which are known<br>
catalyst inhibitors and poisons inevitably reducing the service life of catalysts and<br>
necessitating more frequent catalyst regeneration or change. Metals in bio oils/fats<br><br>
inevitable build up on catalyst surface and change the activity of catalyst. Metals<br>
can promote some side reactions and blocking of active sites of catalysts typically<br>
decreases the activity.<br>
Fatty acid composition, size and saturation degree of the fatty acid may vary con-<br>
siderably in feedstock of different origin. Melting point of bio oil or fat is mainly<br>
consequence of saturation degree. Fats are more saturated than liquid oils and in<br>
this respect need less hydrogen for hydrogenation of double bonds. Double bonds<br>
in fatty acid chains contribute also to different kinds of side reactions, such as<br>
oligomerisation/polymerization, cyclisation/aromatisation and cracking reactions,<br>
which deactivate catalyst, increase hydrogen consumption and reduce diesel yield.<br>
Hydrolysis of triglycerides produces also diglycerides and monoglycerides, which<br>
are partially hydrolyzed products. Diglycerides and monoglycerides are surface-<br>
active compounds, which can form emulsions and make liquid/liquid separations<br>
of water and oil more difficult. Bio oils and fats can also contain other glyceride-<br>
like surface-active impurities like phospholipids, suck as lecithin, which have<br>
phosphorus in their structures. Phospholipids are gum like materials, which can be<br>
harmful for catalysts. Natural oils and fats also contain non-glyceride components.<br>
These are among others waxes, sterols, tocopherols and carotenoids, some metals<br>
and organic sulphur compounds as well as organic nitrogen compounds. These<br>
compounds can be harmful for catalysts or pose other problems in processing.<br>
Plant oils/fats and animal oils/fat may contain free fatty acids, which are formed<br>
during processing of oils and fats through hydrolysis of triglycerides. Free fatty<br>
acids are a class of problematic components in bio oils and fats, their typical con-<br>
tent being between 0 and 30% by weight Free fatty acids are corrosive in their<br>
nature, they can attack the materials of the process unit or catalyst and they can<br>
promote side reactions like formation of metal carboxylates in the presence of<br>
metal impurities. Due to the free fatty acids contained in bio oils and fats, the<br>
formation of heavy molecular weight compounds is significantly increased when<br><br>
compared to triglyceridic bio-feedstock having only low amounts of free fatty<br>
acids, typically below 1% by weight.<br>
Deoxygenation of plant oils/fats and animal oils/fats with hydrogen requires rather<br>
much hydrogen and at the same time releases significant amount of heat. Heat is<br>
produced from the deoxygenation reactions and from double bond hydrogenation.<br>
Different feedstocks produce significantly different amounts of reaction heat. The<br>
variation in reaction heat produced is mainly dependent of double bond hydro-<br>
genation. The average amount of double bonds per triglyceride molecule can vary<br>
from about 1.5 to over 5 depending on the source of bio oil or fat.<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process comprising a hydrotreatment<br>
step and an isomerisation step, for the manufacture of diesel range hydrocarbons<br>
from renewable sources like bio oils and fats, such as plant oils/fats and animal<br>
and fish oils/fets, particularly C12-C16 fattyy acids and/or derivatives thereof in the<br>
presence of sulphur. The invention relates to hydrotreating of the feed comprising<br>
triglycerides, fatty acids and derivatives of fatty acids and particularly C12-C16<br>
fatty acids and/or derivatives thereof or combinations of thereof, into n-paraffins<br>
with reduced hydrogen consumption during hydrotreating, in the presence of sul-<br>
phur, followed by converting the n-paraffins into diesel range branched alkanes<br>
using isomerisation with high diesel yield. The hydrocarbon oil product formed<br>
via this method is a high quality diesel component. In the hydrotreating step the<br>
feed is contacted with a sulphided hydrotreatment catalyst in the presence of sul-<br>
phur, followed by the isomerisation step with an isomerisation catalyst.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
It was surprisingly found that hydrogen consumption in the hydrotreatment step,<br>
deoxygenarion of fatty acids and/or fatty acid derivatives, and cracking during<br><br>
isomerisation of n-paraffins can be significantly reduced by adding one or more<br>
sulphur compounds to the feed to achieve sulphur content of 50-20000 w-ppm,<br>
preferably 1000-8000 w-ppm, most preferably 2000-5000 w-ppm in the feed, cal-<br>
culated as elemental sulphur, particularly when bio oils and fats comprising C12-<br>
C16 fatty acids and/or derivatives thereof are used as the fresh feed for the hy-<br>
drotreatment step.<br>
Feedstock<br>
The bio oil and/or fat used as the fresh feed in the process of the present invention<br>
originates from renewable sources, such as fats and oils from plants and/or ani-<br>
mals and/or fish and compounds derived from them. The basic structural unit of a<br>
typical plant or vegetable or animal oil/fat useful as the feedstock is a triglyceride,<br>
which is a triester of glycerol with three fatty acid molecules, having the structure<br>
presented in the following formula I:<br><br>
In formula I R1, R2 and R3 are alkyl chains. Fatty acids found in natural triglyc-<br>
erides are almost solely fatty acids of even carbon number. Therefore R1, R2, and<br>
R3 typically are C5 - C23 alkyl groups, mainly C11-C19 alkyl groups and most typi-<br>
cally C15 or C17 alkyl groups. R1, R2, and R3 may contain carbon-carbon double<br>
bonds. These alkyl chains can be saturated, unsaturated or polyunsaturated. Suit-<br>
able bio oils are plant and vegetable oils and fats, animal fats, fish oils, and mix-<br>
tures thereof containing fatty acids and/or fatty acid esters. Examples of said ma-<br>
terials are wood-based and other plant-based and vegetable-based fats and oils<br><br>
such as rapeseed oil, colza oil, canola oil, tall oil, sunflower oil, soybean oil,<br>
hempseed oil, olive oil, linseed oil, mustard oil, palm oil, peanut oil, castor oil,<br>
coconut oil, as well as fats contained in plants bred by means of gene manipula-<br>
tion, animal-based fats such as lard, tallow, train oil, and fats contained in milk, as<br>
well as recycled fats of the food industry and mixtures of the above.<br>
Typically a bio oil or fat, suitable as feedstock, comprises C12 - C24 fatty acids,<br>
derivatives thereof such as anhydrides or esters of fatty acids as well as triglyc-<br>
erides of fatty acids or combinations of thereof. The fatty acids or fatty acid de-<br>
rivatives, such as esters may be produced via hydrolysis of bio oils or by their<br>
fractionalization or esterification reactions of triglycerides.<br>
In the process according to the invention the fresh feed contains at least 20 %,<br>
preferably at least 30 % and most preferably at least 40 % by weight of triglyc-<br>
eride C12-C16 fatty acids or C12-C16 fatty acid esters or C12-C16 fatty acids or com-<br>
binations of thereof. Examples of this kind of feed are palm oils and animal fats<br>
containing lower carbon numbers fatty acids, which are typically more saturated<br>
than C18 fatty acids and their decarboxylation tendency is lower than that of<br>
higher carbon number fatty acids during hydrodeoxygenation. The fresh feed may<br>
also comprise feedstock of biological origin and a hydrocarbon or hydrocarbons.<br>
C12-C16 fatty acids can be bound to glycerol as triglycerides or other esters. Ani-<br>
mal fats and palm oil triglycerides contain significant amounts of C16 fatty acids,<br>
typically 15-45 wt-% and especially palmitic acid. Other vegetable triglycerides<br>
contain only 1-13 wt-% C16 fatty acids, for example rapeseed oil only 1-5 wt-%.<br>
In order to avoid catalyst deactivation and undesired side reactions the feed shall<br>
comply with the following requirements: The amount of alkaline and alkaline<br>
earth metals, calculated as elemental alkaline and alkaline earth metals, in the feed<br>
is below 10, preferably below 5 and most preferably below 1 %v-ppm. The amount<br>
of other metals, calculated as elemental metals, in the feed is below 10, preferably<br><br>
below 5 and most preferably below 1 w-ppm. The amount of phosphorus, calcu-<br>
lated as elemental phosphorus is below 30, preferably below 15 and most prefera-<br>
bly below 5 w-ppm.<br>
In many cases the feedstock, such as crude plant oil or animal fat, is not suitable<br>
as such for processing because of high impurity content and thus the feedstock is<br>
preferably purified using suitable one or more conventional purification proce-<br>
dures, before introducing it to the hydrotreating step of the process. Examples of<br>
some conventional procedures are provided in the following.<br>
Degumming of plant oils/fats and animal oils/fats means removal of phosphorus<br>
compounds, such as phospholipids. Solvent extracted vegetable oils contain often<br>
significant amounts of gums, typically 0.5-3% by weight, which are mostly phos-<br>
phatides (phospholipids) and therefore a degumming stage is needed for crude<br>
plant oils and animal fats in order to remove phospholipids and metals present in<br>
crude oils and fats. Iron and also other metals may be present in the form of<br>
metal-phosphatide complexes. Even a trace amount of iron is capable of catalys-<br>
ing oxidation of the oil or fat.<br>
Degumming is performed by washing the feed at 90-105 °C, 300-500 kPa(a), with<br>
H3PO4, NaOH and soft water and separating the formed gums. A major amount of<br>
metal components, which are harmful for the hydrotreatment catalyst, are also<br>
removed from the feedstock during the degumming stage. The moisture content<br>
of the degummed oil is reduced in dryer at 90-105 °C, 5-50 kPa(a).<br>
The amount of free fatty acids present in vegetable oils is typically 1-5 wt % and<br>
in animal fat 10-25 wt-%. High amounts of free fatty acids in a feedstock may be<br>
reduced using a deacidification stage, which may be performed for example by<br>
steam stripping. A feedstock, which is optionally degummed, is typically first<br>
degassed under 5- i 0 kPa(a)a pressure at a temperature of approx. 90 °C, Thereaf-<br>
ter the obtained oil is heated to approx. 250-280 °C, 5-10 kPa(a) and directed to a<br><br>
stripping column, where life steam strips at 230-260 °C the free fatty acids and<br>
deodorizes the oil under vacuum. The fatty acid fraction is withdrawn from the<br>
column overhead.<br>
A feedstock, which is optionally degummed or refined in another conventional<br>
way, may be bleached. In bleaching the degummed or refined feedstock is heated<br>
and mixed with natural or acid-activated bleaching clay. Bleaching removes vari-<br>
ous impurity traces left from other pretreatment steps like degumming, such as<br>
chlorophyll, carotenoids, phosphoipids, metals, soaps and oxidation products.<br>
Bleaching is typically carried out under vacuum to minimize possible oxidation.<br>
Bleaching is used to reduce the color pigments in order to produce an oil of ac-<br>
ceptable color and to reduce the oxidation tendency of oil.<br>
In the following the process according to the invention comprising a hydrotreating<br>
step and an isomerisation step is described in more detail.<br>
Hydrotreating step<br>
The feed to the hydrotreating unit comprises fresh feed and optionally at least one<br>
diluting agent. The diluting agent can be a hydrocarbon of biological origin and/or<br>
non biological origin. In the case the feed comprises additionally at least one di-<br>
luting agent it is preferable that the feed contains less than 20 wt-% of fresh feed.<br>
The diluting agent can also be recycled product from the process (product recycle)<br>
and then the diluting agent / fresh feed-ratio is 5-30:1, preferably 10-30:1 and<br>
most preferably 12-25:1.<br>
The total feed comprising fresh feed containing at least 20 %, preferably at least<br>
30 % and most preferably at least 40 % by weight of triglyceride C12-C16 fatty<br>
acids or C12-C16 fatty acid esters or C12-C16. fatty acids or combinations of thereof,<br>
is hydrotreated in the presence of hydrogen with a catalyst at hydrotreating condi-<br><br>
tions in the presence of 50-20000 w-ppm, preferably 1000-8000 w-ppm, most<br>
preferably 2000-5000 w-ppm of sulphur in the total feed, calculated as elemental<br>
sulphur.<br>
In the hydrotreating step of the process fatty acids, triglycerides and fatty acid<br>
derivatives are deoxygenated, denitrogenated, desulphurisated and dechlorinated.<br>
In the hydrotreating step, known hydrogenation catalysts containing metals from<br>
Group VTII and/or VIB of the Periodic System may be used. Preferably, the hy-<br>
drogenation catalysts are supported Pd, Pt, Ni, NiMo or a CoMo catalysts, the<br>
support being alumina and/or silica, as described for instance in FI 100248. Typi-<br>
cally, N1Mo/Al2O3 and COMo/Al2O3 catalysts are used.<br>
In the hydrotreating step, the pressure range can be varied between 2 and 15 MPa,<br>
preferably between 3 and 10 MPa and most preferably between 4 and 8 MPa, and<br>
the temperature between 200 and 400 °C, preferably between 250 and 350°C and<br>
most preferably 280-345°C.<br>
It was found that the deoxygenation of starting materials originating from renew-<br>
able sources can be controlled between two partially alternative reaction routes:<br>
hydrodeoxygenation and decarboxylation and/or decarbonylation (decarb-<br>
reactions). The selectivity of decarb-reactions and the deoxygenation through de-<br>
carb-reactions can be promoted during hydrotreating over the hydroteatment cata-<br>
lyst, by using sulphur content of 50 - 20000 w-ppm in the total feed. The specific<br>
sulphur content in the feed is able to double the extent of n-paraffins formed by<br>
removal of COx. Complete deoxygenation of triglycerides by decarb-reactions<br>
can theoretically lower the consumption of hydrogen about 60% (max) compared<br>
with pure deoxygenation by hydrogen as can be seen in Table 3.<br>
At least one organic or inorganic, sulphur compound may be fed along with hy-<br>
drogen or with the feed to achieve the desired sulphur content. The inorganic sul-<br><br>
phur compound can be for example H2S or elemental sulphur or the sulphur com-<br>
pound may be an easily decomposable organic sulphur compound such as di-<br>
methyl disulphide, carbon disulphide and butyl thiol or a mixture of easily de-<br>
composable organic sulphur compounds. It is also possible to use refinery gas or<br>
liquid streams containing decomposable sulphur compounds.<br>
It was surprisingly observed from the examples that with added sulphur com-<br>
pounds in the feed, resulting in sulphur contents of 100 - 10000 w-ppm in the<br>
feed the decarboxylation of short chain fatty acids and derivatives, such as C16<br>
fatty acids increases significantly more than that of C18 fatty acids.<br>
When C16 containing fatty acids and derivatives thereof are hydrodeoxygenated,<br>
n-C15 and n-C16 paraffins are formed, with melting points of 9.9°C and 18.2°C<br>
respectively. The conversion of other vegetable oils like rapeseed oil and soybean<br>
oil produces almost totally n-C17 and n-C18 paraffins with significantly higher<br>
melting points of 22.0 and 28.2°C.<br>
Hydrodeoxygenation of triglycerides facilitates controlled decomposition of the<br>
triglyceride molecule contrary to uncontrolled cracking. Double bonds are also<br>
hydrogenated during the controlled hydrotreatment. Light hydrocarbons and gases<br>
formed, mainly propane, water, CO2, CO, H2S and NH3, are removed from hy-<br>
drotreated product.<br>
In the case the fresh feed comprises more than 5 wt-% free fatty acids, it is prefer-<br>
able to use diluting agent or product recycle in the process as described in Figure<br>
1, wherein an improved reactor configuration is presented, particularly for the<br>
control of the increase of temperature over catalyst bed and side reaction forma-<br>
tion. In Figure 1 a hydrotreatment process configuration is provided, comprising<br>
one or more catalyst beds in series, hydrotreated product recycle introduction on<br>
the top of the first catalyst bed and fresh feed, quench liquid and hydrogen intro-<br>
duction on top of each catalyst beds. This results in improved control of the reac-<br><br>
tion temperature in the catalyst beds and hence diminishes undesired side reac-<br>
tions.<br>
In Figure 1 the hydrotreatment reactor 100 comprises two catalyst beds 10 and 20.<br>
Fresh feed 11 is introduced as streams 12 and 13 on the catalyst beds 10 and 20,<br>
respectively, and hydrogen as stream 22 and 23 on the catalyst beds 10 and 20,<br>
respectively. The fresh feed stream 12 is first mixed with the hydrotreated product<br>
recycle stream 41 and quench liquid stream 43 and the resulting mixture 31, di-<br>
luted in the fresh feed concentration, is then introduced on the catalyst bed 10. In<br>
order to obtain a required sulphur concentration in the feed stream 31, required<br>
amount of sulphur make up is added to the fresh feed stream 11 via stream 15. As<br>
mixture 31 passes through the catalyst bed 10 with the hydrogen stream 22, fatty<br>
acids and fatty acid derivatives of the fresh feed stream 12 are converted to the<br>
corresponding reaction products. A two-phase stream 32 is withdrawn from the<br>
bottom of the catalyst bed 10 and is mixed with the fresh feed stream 13, quench<br>
liquid stream 44 and the hydrogen stream 23. The formed vapor-liquid mixture<br>
33, diluted in the fresh feed concentration, is then introduced on the catalyst bed<br>
20 at reduced temperature due to cooling effect of the hydrogen, quench liquid<br>
and fresh feed, passed through the catalyst bed 20 and finally withdrawn from the<br>
catalyst bed as a product stream 34. The stream 34 is separated in to a vapor<br>
stream 35 and liquid stream 36 in the high temperature separator 101. Vapor<br>
stream 35 is rich in hydrogen and is directed to further treatment. Part of the liquid<br>
stream 36 is returned to the reactor 100 as recycle stream 40, which is further di-<br>
vided to dilution stream 41 and total quench liquid stream 42. The quench liquid<br>
stream 42 is cooled in the heat exchanger 102 to provide adequate cooling effect<br>
on the top of the catalyst beds 10 and 20. Hydrotreated product stream 51 is di-<br>
rected from the hydrotreatment step to further processing.<br>
The catalyst beds 10 and 20 may be located in the same pressure vessel or in sepa-<br>
rate pressure vessels. In the embodiment where the catalyst beds are in the same<br>
pressure vessels the hydrogen streams 22 and 23 may alternatively be introduced<br><br>
on the catalyst bed 10 and then be passed through the catalyst beds 10 and 20. In<br>
the embodiment where the catalyst beds are in separate pressure vessels, the cata-<br>
lyst beds may operate in parallel mode with separate dilution streams, hydrogen<br>
streams and quench liquid streams. The number of catalyst beds may be one or<br>
two or more than two.<br>
The sulphur make up to the hydrotreatment step may be introduced with the fresh<br>
feed stream 11. Alternatively, required amount of sulphur may be fed with the<br>
hydrogen streams 22 and 23 as gaseous sulphur component such as hydrogen sul-<br>
phide.<br>
Hydrogen is fed to the hydrotreating reactor in excess of the theoretical hydrogen<br>
consumption. During the hydrotreating step, triglyceride oils, fatty acids and de-<br>
rivatives thereof are almost theoretically converted to n-paraffins without or al-<br>
most without side reactions. Additionally, propane is formed from the glycerol<br>
part of the triglycerides, water and CO and/or CO2 from carboxylic oxygen, H2S<br>
from organic sulphur compounds and NH3 from organic nitrogen compounds.<br>
Using the above described procedures in the hydrotreating step, the temperature<br>
needed for reactions to start up is achieved in the beginning of each catalyst bed,<br>
the temperature increase in the catalyst beds is limited, harmful and partially con-<br>
verted product intermediates can be avoided and the catalyst life is extended con-<br>
siderably. The temperature at the end of the catalyst bed is controlled by net heat<br>
of reactions and to the extent of diluting agent used. Diluting agent may be any<br>
hydrocarbon available, bio-origin or non bio-origin. It can also be product recycle.<br>
If diluting agent is used, fresh feed content from total feed is less than 20 wt-%. If<br>
the product recycle is used, product recycle/fresh feed ratio is 5-30:1, preferably<br>
10-30:1, most preferably 12-25:1. After the hydrotreatment step, the product is<br>
subjected to an isomerisation step.<br><br>
Isomerisation of n-paraffins formed during hydrotreatment<br>
In order to improve the cold properties of the products, isomerisation of n-<br>
paraffrns are needed. During the isomerisation branched isoparaffins are formed.<br>
Isoparaffins may typically have mono-, di-, tri- or tetramethyl branches.<br>
The product obtained from the hydrotreatment step is isomerised with a catalyst<br>
under isomerisation conditions. The feed into the isomerisation reactor is a mix-<br>
ture of pure n-paraffins and the composition of the feed can be predicted from the<br>
fatty acid distribution of each individual bio oil used as feed to the hydrotreat-<br>
ment.<br>
The isomerisation step may comprise an optional purification step, wherein the<br>
reaction product from the hydrotreatment step may be purified using a suitable<br>
method such as stripping with water vapour or a suitable gas such as light hydro-<br>
carbon, nitrogen or hydrogen. Preferably acid gases and water impurities are re-<br>
moved as completely as possible before the hydrocarbons are contacted with the<br>
isomerization catalyst.<br>
In the isomerisation step, the pressure varies in the range of 2-15 MPa, preferably<br>
in the range of 3-10 MPa and the temperature varies between 200 and 500 °C,<br>
preferably between 280 and 400 °C.<br>
In the isomerisation step, isomerisation catalysts known in the art may be used.<br>
Suitable isomerisation catalysts contain a molecular sieve and/or a metal selected<br>
from Group VIII of the Periodic Table and/or a carrier. Preferably, the isomerisa-<br>
tion catalyst contains SAPO-11 or SAPO-41 or ZSM-22 or ZSM-23 or ferrierite<br>
and Pt, Pd or Ni and Al2O3 or S1O2. Typical isomerisation catalysts are, for exam-<br>
ple, Pt/SAPO-ll/Al2O3, Pt/ZSM-22/Al2O3, Pt/ZSM-23/Al2O3 and Pt/SAPO-<br>
11/SiO2.. Most of these catalysts require the presence of hydrogen to reduce the<br>
catalyst deactivation.<br><br>
The isomerised diesel product consists mainly of branched hydrocarbons and also<br>
linear hydrocarbons and it has a boiling range of 180 - 350°C. Additionally some<br>
gasoline and gas may be obtained.<br>
Advantages of the invention<br>
The process according to the invention provides a way to reduce the formation of<br>
higher molecular weight compounds during the hydrotreatment of the fresh feed,<br>
which may contain fatty acids and derivatives thereof. The process according to<br>
the invention provides selective manufacture of diesel range hydrocarbons from<br>
bio oils and fats with high diesel yield and without significant side-reactions.<br>
Branched hydrocarbons can be manufactured from plant and vegetable oils and<br>
fats as well as animal and fish oils and fats using promoted assistance of decarb-<br>
reactions during hydrodeoxygenation and therefore the consumption of hydrogen<br>
is decreased by 20-60 %, typically 20-40 %.<br>
During the deoxygenation of the feed through decarboxylation and/or decarbon-<br>
ylation, oxygen is removed in the form of CO and CO2. The decarb-reactions de-<br>
crease hydrogen consumption, theoretically in complete deoxygenation about 60-<br>
70 % compared to complete hydrodeoxygenation route, but depends on the<br>
triglyceride source. C12-C16 fatty acids and their derivatives have typically lower<br>
amount of double bonds and their decarboxylation tendency is lower than higher<br>
carbon number fatty acids and their derivatives during hydrodeoxygenation. How-<br>
ever, it was surprisingly found that when 50-20 000 w-ppm of sulphur, calculated<br>
as elemental sulphur, was present in the feed comprising fresh feed containing at<br>
least 20 % by weight of C12-C16 fatty acids and/or their derivatives, the decar-<br>
boxylation of C16 fatty acids and derivatives thereof increases significantly more<br>
than that of C18 fatty acids and its derivatives. This results in still lower consump-<br>
tion of hydrogen. Added sulphur compounds in hydrodeoxygenation feed facili-<br>
tate the control of catalyst stability and reduce hydrogen consumption. Feedstock<br><br>
like palm oil or animal fat, containing more saturated fatty acid derivatives, pro-<br>
duces less heat.<br>
It was also found that feeds having a high content of C12-C16 fetty acids and/or<br>
their derivatives decreases hydrogen consumption in the isomerisation step and<br>
also improve cold properties of diesel fuel. The yield of diesel range hydrocarbons<br>
is especially increased during isomerisation of n-paraffins due to the lower crack-<br>
ing of n-paraffins formed from the fatty acid derivative feed to hydrotreatment.<br>
The C11-C16 n-paraffins formed during hydrotreatment need lower conversion and<br>
lower reaction temperature during isomerisation in order to maintain same cold<br>
properties of diesel and thus significantly lower the extent of cracking and coke<br>
formation compared to heavier n-paraffins. Alternatively improved cold proper-<br>
ties can be achieved at the same reaction temperature without yield loss. The sta-<br>
bility of the catalysts during hydrotreating and isomerisation is increased.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the following with examples presenting some pref-<br>
erable embodiments of the invention. However, it is evident to a man skilled in<br>
the art that the scope of the invention is not meant to be limited to these examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1. Effect of sulphur content of total feed<br>
Palm oil containing 0.3 area-% of free fatty acids was used as the fresh feed,<br>
along with product recycle 5:1 in the presence of hydrogen. The content of<br>
triglyceride C12-C16 fatty acids in the fresh feed was 58.3 wt-%. The total teed<br>
contained alkaline and alkaline earth metals, calculated as elemental alkaline and<br>
alkaline earth metals in a amount of below 10 w-ppm. The amount of other met-<br>
als, calculated as elemental metals, in the feed was below 10 w-ppm. The amount<br>
of phosphorus, calculated as elemental phosphorus was below 30 w-ppm.<br><br>
During the test runs various amounts of dimethyl disulfide in the total feed were<br>
used. The reaction temperature was 305 °C, reactor pressure was 5 MPa and space<br>
velocity was 0.5 g/g for fresh feed. Higher content of sulphur in feed significantly<br>
increased the total deoxygenation reactions through CO and CO2 (decarb-<br>
reactions, production of one carbon less n-paraffins than original fatty acid) in-<br>
stead of deoxygenation by hydrogen (HDO, production of same carbon number n-<br>
paraffins than original fatty acid). However the decarb-reactions of C16-fatty ac-<br>
ids increased significantly more than decarb-reactions of higher C18 or C20 fatty<br>
acids. High content of sulphur in the feed decreased the double bond hydrogena-<br>
tion activity of catalyst and also decreased decarb-reactions as can be seen from<br>
table 1, wherein the effect of sulphur content of total feed calculated as elemental<br>
sulphur, on decarb-% of different carbon number fatty acids observed in product<br>
oil (decarb-% calculated from fresh feed) is presented. Table 2 discloses relative<br>
increase of decarb-reactions compared to the feed with 100 w-ppm of sulphur and<br>
table 3 presents theoretical decrease of hydrogen consumption due to decarb-<br>
reactions.<br><br><br><br><br>
Example 2. Effect of C16 fatty acids on cracking during isomerisation and<br>
diesel yield at same pour point level with palm oil feed<br>
Palm oil containing 44.8 wt-% of triglyceride C12-C16 fatty acids was used in the<br>
fresh feed. Dimethyl disulphide was added to palm oil to obtain sulphur content of<br>
about 600 w-ppm in the feed, calculated as elemental sulphur. The feed purity was<br>
same as in example 1, but the amount of free fatty acids was 0.2 area-%. No dilut-<br>
ing agent was used. The feed was hydrotreated at 305 °C in the presence of hy-<br>
drogen, reactor pressure was 5 MPa and space velocity was 2 g/g for fresh feed.<br>
The products contained mainly n-paraffins. The n-paraffin feeds were isomerised<br>
at 317 °C, 4 MPa and WHSV was 3 1/h in presence of hydrogen. The catalyst (A)<br>
contained Pt, SAPO-11 and an alumina support. The amount of hydrocarbons<br>
&gt;C10 was 97 wt-% in the product. The cloud point of the liquid product was -22<br>
°C. Results of analysis of the product are provided in table 4.<br>
A comparative test was carried out with rapeseed oil feed. Rapeseed oil contained<br>
of 4.5 wt-%. of triglyceride C12-C16 fatty acids. Rapeseed oil was hydrotreated and<br>
isomerised at the same reaction conditions as described above. The amount of<br>
hydrocarbons &gt;C 10 was 96 wt-% in the product. The cloud point of the liquid<br>
product was -15 °C. Results of analysis of the product are provided in table 4.<br>
Example 3. Effect of C16 fatty acids on pour point of isomerised diesel oil at<br>
same diesel yield with palm oil feed<br>
The hydrotreated palm oil obtained in Example 2 was isomerised at 312 °C, 4<br>
MPa and WHSV was 3 1/h in the presence of hydrogen with catalyst A. This<br>
yielded a liquid product with a cloud point of-14 °C. The amount of hydrocar-<br>
bons &gt;C10 was now 98 wt-% in the product. A small amount of lighter hydrocar-<br>
bons can be concluded from the flash point and in the distillation curve of the<br>
products as can be seen from table 4, which presents analysis results of hy-<br><br>
drotreated and isornerised products from rapeseed oil and palm oil, and<br>
HRO=hydrotreated rapeseed oil, HPO=hydrotreated palm oil.<br><br>
Example 4. Effect of C16 fatty acids on cracking during isomerisation and<br>
diesel yield at same pour point level with animal fat feed<br>
Animal fat containing 30 wt-% of triglyceride C12-C16 fatty acids was used as<br>
fresh feed. The feed contained alkaline and alkaline earth metals, calculated as<br><br>
elemental alkaline and alkaline earth metals in the amount of below 10 w-ppm<br>
The amount of other metals, calculated as elemental metals, in the feed was below<br>
10 w-ppm The amount of phosphorus, calculated as elemental phosphorus was<br>
below 30 w-ppm. Dimethyl disulphide was added to animal fat to obtain sulphur<br>
content of about 100 w-ppm in the feed. Fresh feed contained free fatty acids 0.6<br>
area-%. The feed was hydrotreated at 300 °C in the presence of hydrogen, reactor<br>
pressure was 5 MPa and space velocity was 2 g/g for fresh feed without any dilut-<br>
ing agent. The products contained mainly n-paraffins. The n-paraffin feeds were<br>
isomerised at 316 °C, 4 MPa and WHSV was 1.5 1/h in the presence of hydrogen.<br>
The catalyst (B) contained Pt, SAPO-11 and an alumina support. The amount of<br>
hydrocarbons &gt;C10 was 95 wt-% in the product. The cloud point of the liquid<br>
product was -20 °C.<br>
As a comparative example, rapeseed oil was hydrotreated and isomerisated at the<br>
same reaction conditions as described above. Rapeseed oil contained 4.5 wt-% of<br>
triglyceride C12-C16 fatty acids. In the isomerised product, the amount of hydro-<br>
carbons &gt;C10 was 95 wt-%. The cloud point of the liquid product was -14 °C.<br>
Example 5. Effect of C16 fatty acids on pour point of isomerised diesel oil at<br>
same diesel yield with animal fat feed<br>
The hydrotreated animal fat obtained in Example 4 was isomerised at 312 °C, 4<br>
MPa and WHSV was 1.5 1/h in the presence of hydrogen with catalyst B. This<br>
yielded a liquid product with a cloud point of-13 °C. The amount of hydrocar-<br>
bons &gt;C10 was now 98 wt-%.<br><br>
