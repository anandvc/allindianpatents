				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of 9, 9-dialkyl substituted<br>
fluorene monomer from fluorene. More specifically, the invention particularly relates<br>
to a fast reaction process for the alkylation of unsubstituted fluorene for synthesizing<br>
the same. Importantly also, the above process; of the invention favors in obtaining<br>
the dialkyl substituted fluorene monomer economically.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
9H-Fluorene commonly known as Fluorene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. It is<br>
combustible, white crystalline material. It exhibits fluorescence, due to which it is<br>
called fluorene, and as such its polymer derivatives are attractive emissive material<br>
in Organic light emitting diodes (OLEOs). Polyfluorene (PFO) is a well-known high<br>
mobility hole transporting blue-emitting polymer for practical applications such as<br>
polymer light emitting diodes (PLED). The high quantum efficiency (QE) of fluorene,<br>
and polymers and copolymers made with fluorene showed excellent luminescence<br>
properties. Fluorene molecules consist of a methylene bridge that can be substituted<br>
with varying carbon chain length anc size, without interfering with the aromatic<br>
rings.<br>
The high quantum efficiency (QE) of fluorene in comparison with various polycyclic<br>
hydrocarbons viz. benzene, naphthalene, anthracene and closely related biphenyl,<br>
has been a preference to the use of fluorene to make optoelectronic devices that<br>
have excellent luminescence properties. However, it is interesting to note that<br>
although both biphenyl and fluorene possess the same degree of conjugation, QE of<br>
fluorene is much better than bipheny s. This is primarily due to the rigidly held<br>
biphenyl rings in fluorene, by a methylene bridge, as compared to the freely rotating<br>
two aromatic rings in the biphenyl. Fluorene offers added advantage due to the<br>
presence of this methylene bridge by allowing substitution of these methylene<br>
hydrogens at the remote 9-position, without interfering with the aromatic rings.<br>
Introducing dialkyl substituents of varying carbon chain length and size onto the<br>
fluorene molecule has been found to influence the optical, thermal, electrical,<br>
electrochemical, morphological and processing parameters of the final polymer, PFO.<br>

reaction to obtain alkylated fluorene has been performed in good yields using butyl<br>

since lithium reagents are extremely moisture sensitive requiring extreme operating<br>
conditions like very low temperatures and strict inert atmosphere.<br>

use of Sodium amide as an effective base for the removal of acidic proton at 9-<br>
position of fluorene molecule for alkylation purposes.<br>
Several drawbacks of these methods remain in the extensive use of organic solvents<br>
and hazardous catalyst or strong acid conditions of the reaction medium.<br>
All these methods either use strong acids, costly and sensitive catalysts, strongly<br>
basic and harsh or extreme reaction conditions, making the overall reaction too<br>
expensive to be facile for practical application. However, yet the art of making<br>
dialkylated fluorene has not yet been achieved and the unsubstituted fluorene<br>
resulted in formation of ketone at 9-position that was responsible for green emission.<br><br>
Cho, S. Y.; Grimsdale, A. C; Jones, D. J.; Watkins, S. E.; Holmes, A. B. J. Amer.<br>
Chem. Soc. 2007, 129(39), 11910-11911 describes the preparation of dialkylated<br>
fluorene using a multistep route by using cyclization of tertiary alcohol that is<br>
reported to be efficient as compared to the other prior arts in this field, however,<br>
employing multi step route that affect the overall economy of the process for<br>
producing 9, 9-dialkylated fluorene.<br>
US Patent 7102042, 2006 is directed to the alkylation of unsubstituted fluorene at<br>
the 9-position by chloro alkanes in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere and a polar<br>
protic solvent. Moreover, the slower reaction rate of 12 hours comprising chloro<br>
alkanes and fluorene gives rise to sufficient time and possibility for the formation of<br>
fluorenone i.e. the ketone at the 9-position of the fluorene molecule. Also the above<br>
said process in US Patent 7102042, 2036, comprising chloro alkanes, makes it more<br>
suitable to academia than industry because of the cost of chloro alkanes which are<br>
not thermally stable and hence not recoverable and reusable.<br>
Various methods for making alkylated fluorene have been developed. However, most<br>
methodologies involve stringent reaction conditicns in using low temperature baths<br>
and inert atmosphere techniques that often utilize a combination of organic solvent,<br>
base, and moisture sensitive reagents tnereby making the entire process difficult to<br>
handle and expensive for industrial applications.<br>
Few of the above said methods also result in incomplete alkylation yielding a mono<br>
alkylated product giving poor yields. Polymers made with these incompletely<br>
alkylated fluorene product resulted in kestone defect formation on exposure to high<br>
temperature and under traces of oxygen<br>
Therefore the above teachings flowing from the background art are summarized to<br>
suffer from either one or many of the drawbacks, which include:<br>
a)	Low yielding and slow process and thus less efficient<br>
b)	Strongly basic and harsh reaction conditions<br>
c)	Moisture sensitive reagent and difficult/ in handling<br>
d)	Longer reaction times thereby generating fluorenone defects<br><br>
e)	Expensive nature of the reagents cind inert gas techniques<br>
f)	Unreacted reagent recovery unknown<br>
It is thus reflected from the above mentioned arts that there is a continuous need in<br>
the art for a simple, economical, practical and a high yielding process for the<br>
dialkylation of fluorene at its 9-position as is described in this embodiment.<br>
There is also a need in the art to develop a process for complete alkylation of<br>
fluorene at its 9-position that would n turn lead to the production of good quality<br>
PFO's or poly fluorene polymers with ro ketone defect formation on exposure to high<br>
temperature and under trace amounts of oxygen.<br>
In light of the above said it is apparent that there is a continuous need in the art to<br>
develop a process for the production of 9,9-dialkylated fluorene in an industrial<br>
scale, which would circumvent all the aforementioned difficulties associated with the<br>
process.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus a basic object of the present invention to provide for a process for the<br>
production of 9, 9-dialkyl substituted conjugated fluorene monomer from fluorene in<br>
an industrial scale that would enable an efficient, economic, environment friendly<br>
and more importantly a high yielding process associated with high product purity.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide for a process for a large scale<br>

Yet a further object of the present nvention is directed to a process for the<br>
production of 9, 9-dialkyl fluorene involving easily available and non-corrosive<br>
reagents in association with a environmentally benign solvent.<br><br>

without any hazard or risk.<br>

9-dialkyl fluorene wherein the desirec products; would be obtained in quantitative<br>
yields.<br>
Still a further object of the invention is to provide for a process for the production of<br>

economize the said process.<br>

polymers (PFO) made out of it.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As already disclosed herein before the present invention comprises of a simple,<br>
economic and environment friendly process for the production of 9, 9-dialkyl<br>
substituted conjugated fluorene monomer from fluorene of the structural formula:<br><br>
Where R' is an alkyl or a substituted alkyl, preferably a saturated hydrocarbon with<br>
varying chain length of 6-11 carbon atons.<br>
The above mentioned 9, 9-dialkyl fluorene are obtained in almost quantitative yields<br>
from the reaction involving fluorene with a desired alkyl halide, R'-Y, in a degassed<br>
atmosphere in the presence of a base and an appropriate amount of the phase<br>
transfer catalyst in a polar solvent preferably water.<br>
The environmentally green method adapted for the preparation of 9, 9-dialkylated<br>
fluorene is economical and does not employ any organic solvent in the reaction<br>
medium that uses water instead.<br><br>
Separation of the above said dialkylated product after the stipulated reaction time is<br>
achieved by simple separation methods, from water, and thus avoids hazardous<br>
separation steps.<br>
The above said dialkylation method is carried out in the absence of oxygen<br>
atmosphere, by a method of degassing for the removal of oxygen and carrying out<br>
the reaction in a degassed atmosphere.<br>
The reaction does not necessarily need to be performed by replacing the oxygen with<br>
other inert gases such as nitrogen, argon, helium, etc.<br>
The above said method was carried out in the presence of only one economical<br>
surfactant used as a phase transfer catalyst that are very stable under high pH, high<br>
temperature and is water soluble that can be easily separated after the formation of<br>
product from the reaction mixture. The preferred phase transfer catalysts used are<br>
tetra alkyl ammonium salts of various ralides. The phase transfer catalysts efficiently<br>
facilitated dialkylation of fluorene. The quantity of catalyst used was minimum and<br>
varied in the range of 5-15 mole percert depending on the kind of alkyl halide used.<br>
The base used in the above said method is laboratory grade sodium or potassium<br>
hydroxide.<br>
Thus, the dialkylation reaction of fluorene in the presence of phase transfer catalyst,<br>
water, degassed atmosphere and an alkyl halide were carried out under moderate<br>
temperatures ranging from 70-100°C, preferably 85 °C. The duration and<br>
temperature of the reaction were varied according to the type of alkyl halide to be<br>
inserted into the fluorene molecule. The base used in this method is laboratory grade<br>
sodium or potassium hydroxide. The dialkylation of fluorene molecule under the<br>
above conditions yielded exclusively the 9, 9-dialkylated products in isolated yields of<br>
80-98 %.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained here under in<br>
greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary illustrations as per the following<br>
examples:<br><br>
The substrate starting material Fluorene and reagent alkyl halides was bought from<br>
Aldrich Chemical Co. and used as such without any further purification. Laboratory<br>
grade sodium or potassium hydroxide (Rankem India) was used as base in the<br>
process of production of 9, 9-dialkylated Fluorene. Water was used to solubilise<br>
sodium or potassium hydroxide	for the above said process.<br>
Example I: Synthesis of 9.9-dialkylated Fluorene<br>
Fluorene (0.21gm, 1.26 x 10"3 moles), 1-bromohexane (1.45_gm, 8.82 x 10'3 moles),<br>
tetrabutylammonium iodide (0.047 gm, 10 mole %) were suspended in 11 ml 50 %<br>
sodium hydroxide solution at room temperature. The reaction mixture was<br>
appropriately degassed to remove traces of oxygen and was then heated to a<br>
temperature of 80 °C for 3.5 hrs. While maintaining the temperature at 80 °C, the<br>
liquid phase was separated, wherein the solid Na-salt remained suspended in the top<br>
organic phase. The organic phase was washed three times with 50 x 3 ml water. The<br>
resulting organic phase was weighed to give 0.401 gm of the crude product, which<br>
was further purified by column chromatography (silica column) using 1-3 % of ethyl<br>
acetate/hexane as an eluent to yield 9, 9-dialkyl fluorene in 96 % yield. The above<br>
synthetic procedure followed is further briefly outlined below in Scheme 1<br>
hereunder.<br><br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. All<br>
percentages are by weight.<br>
The above exemplary illustration of the process of the invention clearly reveals a<br>
highly efficient, economized and an environmentally green process for the production<br><br>
of 9, 9- dialkyl fluorene through a chemically safe route. Respective yield of the said<br>
dialkylated product is &gt; 80 % irresoective of the kind of alkyl halide used. The<br>
dialkylation process is preferably achieved without employing any kind of organic<br>
solvent and without the use of any strong acids. Since the reaction is carried out<br>
under degassed conditions the process does not essentially need external pressure<br>
on the reaction medium and thereby does not involve any kind of hazard or the risk<br>
of explosion. The unreacted reagents that comprises of an aqueous solution of base<br>
and excess alkyl halide are easily separated from the reaction mixture thereby<br>
enabling recycle and reuse to ensure a yield of &gt; 75 % of 9, 9- dialkyl fluorene in the<br>
next recycle. The phase transfer catalyst is recovered from the above said process in<br>
untraceable amounts.<br>
The method described herein permits to introduce dialkyl chains of varying carbon<br>
chain length, types with bulky substituents at 9, 9'-position of fluorene molecule.<br>
The above said process is fast in yielding 9, 9'-dialkyl fluorene in a short span of time<br>
~3.5 hours in yields &gt;80%. It is also noteworthy that the reaction proceeds in a<br>
degassed atmosphere, which further economizes the process of production in not<br>
needing nitrogen or any type of inert gases.<br>
Advantageously the process providec in this invention is environmentally green<br>
because of the use of water as a solvent in the reaction medium and the non-toxic<br>
nature of the reagents used. Accordirgly the process provided in this invention is<br>
favorable with respect to easy handling of the reagents, which are moisture<br>
insensitive.<br>
Conclusively, the drawbacks of US pa:ent 7102042, 2006 are circumvented in the<br>
present process of the invention on using bromo alkanes under degassed reaction<br>
conditions whereby the bromo alkares are obtainable in the form of various<br>
derivatives that are cheap, thermally more stable, recoverable and reusable and of<br>
more practical importance than the chloro alkanes. Also, the process of the present<br>
invention gets completed in ~4 hours and thereby has a much lower possibility of<br>
ketone formation in 9-position of the fluorene molecule obtained as an undesired<br>
side product in comparison to US patent 7102042, 2006 that takes 12 hours to<br>
proceed to completion.<br><br>
More advantageously, the bromo alkenes have higher boiling points and higher flash<br>
points w.r.t the chloro alkanes of comparative chain length thus making handling<br>
safer.<br>
Unlike the prior art US patent 710242, 2006, this process of the present invention<br>
for producing 9, 9-dialkyl fluorene is deemed efficient with various alkyl halides<br>
possessing linear carbon chain, brarched carbon chain and carbon chain having<br>
bulky groups like bromide and iodide at both ends.<br>
It is thus possible by way of the present invention to provide for a process for the<br>
production of 9, 9-dialkyl fluorene from fluorene on complete alkylation which is<br>
efficient in terms of the time required to accomplish high yields of the product and<br>
also in terms of recovery of the starting materials for recycle and reuse.<br>
Compositions or poly fluorene polymers like (PFO) made out of 9, 9-dialkyl<br>
substituted conjugated fluorene monomer synthesized by the above said process is<br>
free all mono substituted fluorene and s free of ketone defect formation on exposure<br>
to high temperature and traces amounts of oxygen.<br>
The process is environmentally green, most significantly for water being used as the<br>
solvent for reaction and also for the non-toxic nature of the reagents needed. It is<br>
easy to operate in terms of the moisture insensitive reagents needed for the<br>
purpose.<br><br>
