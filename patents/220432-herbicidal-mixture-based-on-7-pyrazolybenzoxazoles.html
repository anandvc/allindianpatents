HERBICIDAL MIXTURES BASED ON 7-PYRAZOYLBENZOXAZOLES<br>
The present invention relates to herbicidally active compositions comprising 7-pyrazolylbenzoxa20lss and at least one further active compound selected from herbicidally active compounds and safeners.<br>
In crop protection products, it is desirable in principle to increase the specificity and the reliability of the action of active compounds. In particular, it is desirable for the crop protection product to control the harmful plants effectively and, at the same time, to be tolerated by the useful plants in question.<br>
Various publications have described 7-pyrazolylben2oxazoles as being highly effective herbicides. However, their compatibility with dicotyledonous crop plants such as cotton, oilseed rape and some graminaceous plants such as barley, millet, corn, rice, wheat and sugar cane is not always satisfactory, i.e. in addition to the harmful plants, the crop plants are also damaged to an extent which is not acceptable. It is possible to spare the useful plants by lowering the application rates; however, the extent of the control of harmful plants is naturally also reduced.<br>
It is known that certain combinations of different herbicides with specific action result in an enhanced activity of a herbicide component by synergism. As a consequence, it is possible to reduce the application rates of herbicidally active compounds required for controlling the harmful plants. Furthermore, it is known that in some cases better crop plant compatibility can be achieved by joint application of specifically acting herbicides with organic active compounds, some of which are themselves herbicidally active. In these cases, the active compounds act as antidote or antagonist, and, owing to the fact that they can reduce or even prevent damage to the crop Dlants, they are also referred to as safeners.<br>
riO  98/27090 and WO 99/55702 disclose 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazoles of the formula I<br><br><br>
in which the variables R^ - RE and 2 are as defined below: R'^  is hydrogen, Ci-Ca-alkyl or Ci-Cfl-haloalkyl;<br>
RB  is cyano, Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-Cj-haloalkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy, Ci-C4-haloalkoxy, Ci-C4-alkylthio, Ci-C4-haloalkylthio, Ci-C4-alkylsulfinyl, Ci-C4-haloalkylsulfinyl, Ci-C4-alkylsulfonyl, Ci-C4-haloalkylsulfonyl;<br>
R'^  is hydrogen, cyano, nitro, halogen, Ci-C4-alkyl or Ci-C4-haloalkyl;<br>
R^     is halogen or hydrogen;<br>
R^  is hydrogen, halogen, cyano, Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-C4-haloalkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy or Ci-C^-haloalkoxy, and<br>
Z together with the phenyl ring to which it is attached forms a benzoxazole ring or a benzothiazole ring which is substituted by various substituents.<br>
However, the herbicidal action of the compounds described therein is unsatisfactory. Furthermore, at higher dosages, their compatibility with useful plants is not always ensured.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide herbicidal compositions having increased activity against unwanted harmful plants and at the same time better compatibility with useful plants.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved, surprisingly, by compositions comprising A) at least one 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole of the formula I<br><br><br>
I which the variables R^ - R^ are as defined below:<br>
is difluoromethoxy, trifluoromethyl or methylsulfonyl;<br>

;he agriculturally acceptable salts of the active compounds B anc : and the agriculturally acceptable derivatives of the active rompounds B and C, provided they have a carboxyl group,<br>
?he invention relates in particular to compositions in the form )f herbicidally active crop protection compositions comprising a lerbicidally effective amount of at least one mixture of A with' i and/or C, as defined above, and at least one liquid and/or solid<br><br>
carrier, if desired, one or more surfactants and, if desired, one or more further auxiliaries customary for crop protection compositions. The invention also relates to compositions in the form of a crop protection composition formulated as a 2-coraponent<br>
i composition comprising a first component which comprises the<br>
active compound A, a solid or liquid carrier and, if appropriate, one or more surfactants, and a second component which comprises at least one further active compound selected from the herbicides B and the safeners C, a solid or liquid carrier and, if<br>
) appropriate, one or more surfactants, where both components may additionally also comprise further auxiliaries customary for crop protection compositions.<br>
Compositions according to the invention which comprise both at i least one 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole of the formula I and at least one herbicide B surprisingly have better herbicidal activity, i.e. better action against harmful plants, than would have been expected based on the herbicidal action observed for the individual compounds. Compositions comprising a I 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole I, a herbicide B and one of the compounds mentioned under C likewise have better herbicidal action against harmful plants than would have been expected based on the herbicidal activity of the individual compounds. The herbicidal action to be expected, based on the individual compounds, for the mixtures can be calculated using Colby's formula (see below). If the observed activity exceeds the expected additive activity of the individual compounds, this is referred to as synergism.<br>
Compositions according to the invention comprising both at least one 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole of the formula I and at least one of the compounds listed under C show, with comparable herbicidal action, better compatibility with useful plants than a composition comprising the 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole I on its own. This also applies, in a similar manner, to compositions comprising a T-pyrazolylbenzoxazole I, a herbicide B and one of the compounds mentioned under C, compared to compositions comprising only a 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole I and a herbicide B.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a method for controlling undesirable vegetation, in particular in crops of cereals, corn, soybeans, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, potatoes, groundnuts or in perennial crops, and also in crops which, by genetic engineering or by breeding, are resistant to one or more herbicides or to attack by insects. The invention also relates to a method for the desiccation or defoliation of plants. In the latter methods it is immaterial whether the herbicidally active compounds of components A) and B) and/or C) are formulated and applied jointly<br><br>
or separately, and, in the case of separate application, in which order the application takes place.<br>
The organic moieties mentioned in the definition of the substituents R^ to R^ in formula I and R^ to R^s in the formulae II and III below or as radicals on cycloalkyl, phenyl or heterocyclic rings are - like the term halogen — collective terms for individual enumerations of the individual group members.

In the ready-to-use preparations, i.e. in the compositions according to the invention in the form of crop protection products, the components A and B and/or C, in suspended,<br><br>
emulsified or dissolved form, can be present formulated jointly or separately. The use forms depend entirely on the intended use.<br>
The compositions according to the invention can be applied, for example, in the form of directly sprayable aqueous solutions, powders, suspensions, also highly-concentrated aqueous, oily or other suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes, dusts, materials for spreading or granules, by means of spraying, atomizing, dusting, broadcasting or watering. The use forms depend on the intended use; in any case, they should ensure the finest possible distribution of the active compounds.<br>
Depending on the form in which the ready-to-use preparations are present in the compositions according to the invention, they comprise one or more liquid or solid carriers, if appropriate surfactants and if appropriate further auxiliaries which are customary for formulating crop protection products. The person skilled in the art is sufficiently familiar with the recipes for such formulations.<br>
The ready-to-use preparations comprise the components A and B and/or C and auxiliaries which are customary for formulating crop protection products, which auxiliaries may also comprise a liquid carrier.<br>
Suitable inert auxiliaries with carrier function are essentially:<br>
mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling point, such as kerosine and diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. paraffins, tetrahydronaphthalene, alkylated naphthalenes and their derivatives, alkylated benzenes and their derivatives, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and cyclohexanol, ketones such as cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, e.g. amines such as N-methylpyrrolidone, and water.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, suspensions, pastes, wettable powders or water-dispersible granules by adding water. To prepare emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the active compounds A) to C), as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is also possible to prepare concentrates consisting of active substance, wetting agent, tackifier,<br><br>
dispersant or emulsifier and, if desired, solvent or oil, and these concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
Suitable surfactants are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and ammonium salts of aromatic sulfonic acids, e.g. ligno-, phenol-, naphthalene- and dibutylnaphthalenesulfonic acid, and of fatty acids, of alkyl- and alkylaryisulfonates, of alkyl sulfates, lauryl ether sulfates and fatty alcohol sulfates, and salts of sulfated hexa-, hepta- and octadecanols and of fatty alcohol glycol ethers, condensates of sulfonated naphthalene and its derivatives with formaldehyde, condensates of naphthalene or of the naphthalenesulfonic acids with phenol and formaldehyde, polyoxyethyiene octylphenol ether, ethoxylated isooctyl-, octyl-or nonylphenol, alkylphenyl polyglycol ether, tributylphenyl polyglycol ether, alkylaryl polyether alcohols, isotridecyl alcohol, fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide condensates, ethoxylated castor oil, polyoxyethyiene alkyl ether or polyoxypropylene alkyl ether, lauryl alcohol polyglycol ether acetate, sorbitol esters, lignosulfite waste liquors or methylcellulose.<br>
Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br>
Granules, e.g. coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous granules, can be prepared by binding the active compounds to solid carriers. Solid carriers are mineral earths such as silicas, silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth, calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials, fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin such as cereal meal, tree bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders, or other solid carriers.<br>
The concentrations of the active compounds in the ready-to-use preparations can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight, of active compounds. The active compounds are employed in a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to HMR spectrum).<br>
The compositions according to the invention can, for example, be formulated as follows:<br><br>
I	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 80 parts by weight of alkylated benzene, 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 8 to 10 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 itiol of oleic acid H-monoethanolamide, 5 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and 5 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active compound.<br>
II	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 40 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 30 parts by weight of isobutanol, 20 parts by weight of the adduct of 7 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to 1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it therein gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active compound.<br>
III	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are dissolved in a mixture composed of 25 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 65 parts by weight of a mineral oil fraction of boiling point 210 to 280°C and 10 parts by weight of the adduct of 40 mol of ethylene oxide to<br>
1 mol of castor oil. Pouring the solution into 100 000 parts by weight of water and finely distributing it thereiti gives an aqueous dispersion which comprises 0.02% by weight of the active compound.<br>
IV	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed thoroughly with 3 parts by weight of sodium diisobutylnaphthalenesulfonate, 17 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a lignosulfonic acid from a sulfite waste liquor and 60 parts by weight of pulverulent silica gel, and the mixture is ground in a hammer mill. Finely distributing the mixture in 20 000 parts by weight of water gives a spray mixture which comprises 0.1% by weight of the active compound.<br>
V	3 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed with 97 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dust which comprises 3% by weight of the active compound.<br><br>
VI	20 parts by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question are mixed intimately with 2 parts by weight of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate, 8 parts by weight of fatty alcohol polyglycol ether, 2 parts by weight of the sodium salt of a phenol-urea-formaldehyde condensate and 68 parts by weight of a paraffinic mineral oil. This gives a stable oily dispersion.<br>
VII	1 part by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question is dissolved in a mixture composed of 70 parts by weight of cyclohexanone, 20 parts by weight of ethoxylated isooctylphenol and 10 parts by weight of ethoxylated castor oil. This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
VIII	1 part by weight of the active compound or active compound mixture in question is dissolved in a mixture composed of 80 parts by weight of cyclohexanone and 20 parts by weight of Wettol^ EH 31 (nonionic emulsifier based on ethoxylated castor oil). This gives a stable emulsion concentrate.<br>
The components A and B and/or C can be formulated jointly or separately.<br>
The components A and B and/or C can be applied jointly or separately, simultaneously or successively, before, during or after emergence of the plants.<br>
If the active compounds A and B and/or C are less well tolerated by certain crop plants, it is possible to use application methods in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed with the aid of sprayers in such a way that the leaves of the sensitive crop plants are as far as possible unaffected, whereas the active compounds reach the leaves of the undesirable plants growing underneath or the uncovered soil surface {post-directed, lay-by).<br>
The required application rate of the pure active compound composition, i.e. of A and B and/or C without formulation auxiliary, depends on the composition of the plant stem, on the development stage of the plants, on the climatic conditions of the location where the composition is used and on the application method, in general, the application rate of A and B and/or C is from 0.001 to 3 kg/ha, preferably frotn 0.005 to 2 kg/ha and in particular from 0.01 to 1 kg/ha of active substance (a.s.).<br><br>
The required application rates of 7-pyra2olylbenzoxazoles are generally in  the range from 0.1 g/ha to 1 kg/ha and preferably in :he range from 1 g/ha to 500 g/ha or from 5 g/ha to 500 g/ha of<br>
i.S.<br>
The compositions are applied to the plants mainly by foliar spraying. Application can be carried out by customary spraying techniques using, for example, water as carrier and spray liquor rates of from about 100 to 1 000 1/ha (for example from 300 to 900  1/ha). Application of the herbicidal compositions by the Low-volume and the ultra-low-volume method is possible, as is their application in the form of micro granules.<br>
The compositions according to the present invention are suitable<br>
for controlling common harmful plants in useful plants, in	,<br>
particular in crops such as wheat, barley, oats, corn, soybean,<br>
sorghum, rice, oilseed rape, cotton, potatoes, dry beans,<br>
groundnuts or in perennial crops. In another embodiment of the<br>
invention, they are useful for controlling the whole vegetation,<br>
i. e. they act as a total weedkiller. Futhermore, in another<br>
emodiment of the present invention, the compositions are useful<br>
for controlling undesirable vegetation in forestry.<br>
Moreover, the compositions according to the present invention are also suitable for the desiccation and/or defoliation of plants.<br>
As desiccants, they are suitable, in particular, for desiccating the above-ground parts of crop plants such as potatoes, oilseed rape, sunflowers and soya beans. This allows completely mechanical harvesting of these important crop plants.<br>
Also of economic interest is<br>
the coordinated dehiscence of fruits or the reduction of their adherence to the plant, for example in citrus fruit, olives or other kinds and species of pernicious fruit, stone fruit and nuts, since this facilitates harvesting of these fruits, and also the controlled defoliation of useful plants, in particular cotton. The dehiscence which is promoted by the application of compositions according to the invention is due to the formation of abscission tissue between the fruit or leaf and shoot part of the plants. The defoliation of cotton is of very particular economic interest since it facilitates harvesting. Simultaneously, the shortening of the window<br><br>
■within which the individual plants mature leads to increased quality of the harvested fiber material.<br>
■loreover, it may be useful to apply the compositions according to :he invention jointly as a mixture with other crop protection Droducts, for example with pesticides or agents for controlling Dhytopathogenic fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the niscibility with mineral salt solutions which are employed for ireating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Jon-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
?he compositions according to the invention can also be used in :rop plants which are resistant to one or more herbicides owing :o genetic engineering or breeding or which are resistant to ittack by insects owing to genetic engineering or breeding. Suitable are for example crop plants which are resistant to lerbicidal EPSP synthase inhibitors, such as, for example, jlyphosate, to herbicidal glutamine synthase inhibitors, such as, :or example, glufosinate, to herbicidal protoporphyrinogen-IX )xidase inhibitors, such as, for example, butafenacil, or to lerbicidal AIS inhibitors, such as, for example, imazamethabenz, .mazamox, imazapic, imazapyr, imazaquin, imazethapyr, or crop )lants which, owing to introduction of the gene for Bt toxin by jenetic modification, are resistant to attack by certain insects.<br>
;urprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which lomprise at least one 7-pyrazolylbenzoxazole of the formula I and it least one herbicide B have better herbicidal activity against larmful plants than would have been expected by the herbicidal ictivity of the individual compounds. In other words, the joint ipplication of 7-pyrazolylben20xazole I and herbicide B results .n an enhanced activity against harmful plants in the sense of a lynergy effect (synergism). For this reason, the mixtures can, )ased on the individual components, be used at lower application ■ates to achieve a herbicidal effect comparable to the individual ;omponents.<br>
;urprisingly, the compositions according to the invention which, .n addition to the 7-pyrazolylbenzoxa2ole I and, if appropriate, :he herbicide B, comprise an active compound from group C are letter tolerated by useful plants than the respective '-pyrazolylbenzoxazole I or the respective mixture of '-pyrazolylbenzoxazole + herbicide B without active compound of jroup C.<br>
Jse Examples<br><br>
of components A and B and,   if  appropriate,   C on  the  growth  of undesirable  plants compared to  the  herbicidally active compounds alone was  demonstrated by the   following greenhouse  experiments (Examples   1   to 33):<br>
For  the post-emergence treatment,   the  test plants  were'first grown  to  a height of 3  to  20  cm,   depending on the  plant habit, and only then treated.   Here,   the  herbicidal  compositions were suspended or  emulsified in water  as   distribution medium and sprayed using  finely distributing nozzles.<br>
For  the pre-emergence treatment,   the  test plants  were  sown   is pots   1-2  days   later,   i.e.   prior  to  germination,   the pots were sprayed with the  finely distributed  herbicidal compositions, which  had been suspended  in water.<br>
The  respective components A and B and/or C were  formulated  as   10% by weight  strength emulsion concentrate  and  introduced to the spray liquor with the  amount of  solvent  system used  for applying the  active compound.   In the  examples,   the   solvent  used was  water.<br>
The  test period extended over  21  days.   During this  time,   the plants were   tended,   and their response  to the treatments with active  compound was evaluated.<br>
The  evaluation  for the damage caused by the  chemical compositions was  carried out using  a scale   from  0  to   100%,   compared to the untreated control plants.   Here,   0 means  no damage  and   100 means complete  destruction of the plants.<br>
In  the examples below,   the value E which   is   to be expected  if  the activity of  the  individual  active compounds   is   just additive was calculated using the method of'S.   R,   Colby   (1967)   "Calculating synergistic   and antagonistic responses  of  herbicide combinations".   Weeds   15,   p.   22   ff.<br>
E   =  X   +  Y  -   (X-Y/100)<br>
where<br>
X = effect in percent using active compound A at an  application rate a;<br>
Y = effect in percent using active compound B at an application rate b;<br><br>
E = expected effect (in %) of A + B at application rates a + b.<br>
If the value calculated in this manner is higher than the value E calculated according to Colby, a synergistic effect is present.<br>
