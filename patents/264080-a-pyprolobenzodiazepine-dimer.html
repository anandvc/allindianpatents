				<td>PYRROLOBENZODIAZEPINES<br>
The present invention relates to pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs), and in particular pyrrolobenzodiazepine dinners bearing C2 aryl substitutions.<br>
Background to the invention<br>
Some pyrrolobenzodiazepines (PBDs) have the ability to recognise and bond to specific sequences of DNA; the preferred sequence is PuGPu. The first PBD antitumour antibiotic, anthramycin, was discovered in 1965 (Leimgruber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 5793-5795 (1965); Leimgruber, etal., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 87, 5791-5793 (1965)). Since then, a number of naturally occurring PBDs have been reported, and over 10 synthetic routes have been developed to a variety of analogues (Thurston, et a/., Chem. Rev. 1994, 433-465 (1994)). Family members include abbeymycin (Hochlowski, etal., J. Antibiotics, 40, 145-148 (1987)), chicamycin (Konishi, etal., J. Antibiotics, 37, 200-206 (1984)), DC-81 (Japanese Patent 58-180 487; Thurston, et a/., Chem. Brit, 26, 767-772 (1990); Bose, et a/., Tetrahedron, 48, 751-758 (1992)), mazethramycin (Kuminoto, etal., J. Antibiotics, 33, 665-667 (1980)), neothramycins A and B (Takeuchi, et a/., J. Antibiotics, 29, 93-96 (1976)), porothramycin (Tsunakawa, etal., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1366-1373 (1988)), prothracarcin (Shimizu, etal, J. Antibiotics, 29, 2492-2503 (1982); Langley and Thurston, J. Org. Chem., 52, 91-97 (1987)), sibanomicin (DC-102)(Hara, et at., J. Antibiotics, 41, 702-704 (1988); Itoh, et a/., J. Antibiotics, 41, 1281-1284 (1988)), sibiromycin (Leber, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 110, 2992-2993 (1988)) and tomamycin (Arima, et al., J. Antibiotics, 25, 437-444 (1972)). PBDs are of the general structure:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
They differ in the number, type and position of substituents, in both their aromatic A rings and pyrrolo C rings, and in the degree of saturation of the C ring. In the B-ring there is either an imine (N=C), a carbinolamine(NH-CH(OH)), or a carbinolamine methyl ether (NH-CH(OMe)) at the N10-C11 position which is the electrophilic centre responsible for alkylating DNA. All of the known natural products have an (S)-configuration at the chiral C11a position which provides them with a right-handed twist when viewed from the C ring towards the A ring. This gives them the appropriate three-dimensional shape for isohelicity<br><br>
with the minor groove of B-form DNA, leading to a snug fit at the binding site (Kohn, In Antibiotics III. Springer-Verlag, New York, pp. 3-11 (1975); Hurley and Needham-VanDevanter, Ace. Chem. Res,, 19, 230-237 (1986)). Their ability to form an adduct in the minor groove, enables them to interfere with DNA processing, hence their use as antitumour agents.<br>
The present inventors have previously disclosed, in WO 2004/043963, cytotoxic compounds having an aryl group at the C2 position, for example:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
The present inventors have also previously disclosed, in co-pending PCT application PCT/GB2005/000768 (published as WO 2005/085251), dimeric PBD compounds bearing C2 aryl substituents, such as:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The present inventors have encountered some issues with the solubility of compounds<br>
such as ZC-207, which they have resolved by the use of a different form of these<br>
compounds.<br>
The present invention comprises a compound with the formula I:<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or solvate thereof, wherein:<br>
R2 is an optionally substituted C5.20 aryl group;<br><br>
R6 and R9 are independently selected from H, R, OH, OR, SH, SR, NH2, NHR, NRR1, nitro,<br>
Me3Sn and halo;<br>
where R and R' are independently selected from optionally substituted C1-12 alkyl, C3.20<br>
heterocyclyl and C5.20aryl groups;<br>
R7 is selected from H, R, OH, OR, SH, SR, NH2, NHR, NHRR', nitro, Me3Sn and halo;<br>
R" is a C3-12 alkylene group, which chain may be interrupted by one or more heteroatoms,<br>
e.g. 0, S, NH, and/or aromatic rings, e.g. benzene or pyridine;<br>
X is selected from O, S, or NH;<br>
z is 2 or 3;<br>
M is a monovalent pharmaceutically acceptable cation;<br>
R2', R6', R7', R9', X' and M' are selected from the same groups as R2, R6, R7, R9, X and M<br>
respectively, or M and M' may together represent a divalent pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
cation.<br>
Pyrrolobenzodiazepines having an imine bond are known to convert to the di-carbinolamine form in water, and isolated pyrrolobenzodiazepines often exist as a mixture of the imine, mono-carbinolamine and di-carbinolamine forms. Furthermore, if the compound is isolated as a solid with a mixture of these three forms, the balance between them may change overtime. Although this does not pose a problem for administration of the compound, it can provide difficulties in accurately assessing the amount of active substance in a given amount of powder. Compounds of the present invention, at least to some extent, overcome this difficulty whilst remaining activity, and are thus suited to formulation as Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Dimeric pyrrolobenzodiazepines offer advantages over monomeric pyrrolobenzodiazepines in that they possess the ability to cross-link DNA in the minor groove, which can lead to an increase in cytotoxicity.<br>
Further aspects of the invention relate to the compounds use in methods of therapy (particularly in treating proliferative diseases), pharmaceutical compositions comprising the compounds, and their use in the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a proliferative disease.<br><br>

(Formula Removed)<br><br>
Note that, except as discussed below for tautomeric forms, specifically excluded from the term "isomers", as used herein, are structural (or constitutional) isomers (i.e. isomers which differ in the connections between atoms rather than merely by the position of atoms in space). For example, a reference to a methoxy group, -OCH3, is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, a hydroxymethyl group, -CH2OH. Similarly, a reference to ortho-chlorophenyl is not to be construed as a reference to its structural isomer, meta-chlorophenyl. However, a reference to a class of structures may well include structurally isomeric forms falling within that class (e.g. C^/alkyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl; butyl includes n-, iso-, sec-, and tert-butyl; methoxyphenyl includes ortho-, meta-, and para-methoxyphenyl).<br>
The above exclusion does not pertain to tautomeric forms, for example, keto-, enol-, and enolate-forms, as in, for example, the following tautomeric pairs: keto/enol (illustrated below), imine/enamine, amide/imino alcohol, amidine/amidine, nitroso/oxime, thioketone/enethiol, N-nitroso/hyroxyazo, and nitro/aci-nitro.<br>

Unless otherwise specified, a reference to a particular compound includes all such isomeric forms, including (wholly or partially) racemic and other mixtures thereof. Methods for the preparation (e.g. asymmetric synthesis) and separation (e.g. fractional crystallisation and chromatographic means) of such isomeric forms are either known in the art or are readily obtained by adapting the methods taught herein, or known methods, in a known manner.<br>
It may be convenient or desirable to prepare, purify, and/or handle a corresponding solvate of the active compound. The term "solvate" is used herein in the conventional sense to refer to a complex of solute (e.g. active compound, salt of active compound) and solvent. If the solvent is water, the solvate may be conveniently referred to as a hydrate, for example, a mono-hydrate, a di-hydrate, a tri-hydrate, etc.<br><br>

As discussed in that patent application, a key step in a preferred route to PBDs is a cyclisation to produce the B-ring, involving generation of an aldehyde (or functional equivalent thereof) at what will be the 11-position, and attack thereon by the Pro-N10-nitrogen:<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the substituents are as defined above, R8 represents the link (-X-R"-X-) to the other PBD moiety, R10 is a nitrogen protecting group and R12 is R2 or a precursor thereof. The "masked aldehyde" -CPQ may be an acetal or thioacetal, in which case the cyclisation involves unmasking. Alternatively, it may be an alcohol -CHOH, in which case the reaction involves oxidation, e.g. by means of TPAP, TEMPO or DMSO (Swern oxidation).<br>
The masked aldehyde compound can be produced by condensing a corresponding 2,4-substituted pyrrolidine with a 2-nitrobenzoic acid:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The nitro group can then be reduced to -NH2 and protected by reaction with a suitable agent, e.g. a chloroformate, which provides the removable nitrogen protecting group in the compound of formula IV.<br>
A process involving the oxidation-cyclization procedure is illustrated in scheme 1 (an alternative type of cyclisation will be described later with reference to scheme 2).<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Exposure of the alcohol (B) (in which the Pro-N10-nitrogen is generally protected as carbamate) to tetrapropylammonium perruthenate (TPAP)/N-methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO) over A4 sieves results in oxidation accompanied by spontaneous B-ring closure to afford the desired product IV. The TPAP/NMO oxidation procedure is found to be particularly convenient for small scale reactions while the use of DMSO-based oxidation methods, particularly Swern oxidation, proves superior for larger scale work (e.g. &gt; 1 g). A particularly preferred oxidising agent is (diacetoxyiodo)benzene (1.1 eq) and TEMPO (0.1 eq) dissolved in CH2CI2.<br>
The uncyclized alcohol (B) may be prepared by the reaction of a nitrogen protection reagent of formula D, which is preferably a chloroformate or acid chloride, to a solution of the amino alcohol C, generally in solution, generally in the presence of a base such as pyridine (preferably 2 equivalents) at a moderate temperature (e.g. at 0°C). Under these conditions little or no O-acylation is usually observed.<br>
The key amino alcohol C may be prepared by reduction of the corresponding nitro compound E, by choosing a method which will leave the rest of the molecule intact. Treatment of E with tin (II) chloride in a suitable solvent, e.g. refluxing methanol, generally affords, after the removal of the tin salts, the desired product in high yield.<br>
Exposure of E to hydrazine/Raney nickel avoids the production of tin salts and may result in a higher yield of C, although this method is less compatible with the range of possible C and A-ring substituents. For instance, if there is C-ring unsaturation (either in the ring itself, or in R2 or R3), this technique may be unsuitable. Another suitable means of reduction would be catalytic hydrogenation using palladium on carbon as a catalyst.<br>
The nitro compound of formula E may be prepared by coupling the appropriate o-nitrobenzoyl chloride to a compound of formula F, e.g. in the presence of K2CO3 at -25°C under a N2 atmosphere.   Compounds of formula F can be readily prepared, for example by olefination of the ketone derived from L-trans-hydroxy proline. The ketone intermediate can also be exploited by conversion to the enol triflate for use in palladium mediated coupling reactions.<br>
The o-nitrobenzoyl chloride is synthesised from the o-nitrobenzoic acid (or alkyl ester after hydrolysis) of formula G, which itself is prepared from the vanillic acid (or alkyl ester) derivative H. Many of these are commercially available and some are disclosed in Althuis, T.H. and Hess, H.J., J. Medicinal Chem., 20(1), 146-266 (1977).<br>
Alternative Cyclisation (Scheme 2)<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
In scheme 1, the final or penultimate step was an oxidative cyclisation. An alternative, using thioacetal coupling, is shown in scheme 2. Mercury-mediated unmasking causes cyclisation to the protected PBD compound IV.<br>
The thioacetal compound may be prepared as shown in scheme 2: the thioacetal protected C-ring [prepared via a literature method: Langley, D.R. &amp; Thurston, D.E., J. Organic Chemistry, 52, 91-97 (1987)] is coupled to the o-nitrobenzoic acid (or alkyl ester after hydrolysis) (G) using a literature procedure. The resulting nitro compound cannot be reduced by hydrogenation, because of the thioacetal group, so the tin(ll) chloride method is used to afford the amine. This is then N-protected, e.g., by reaction with a chloroformate or acid chloride, such as 2,2,2-trichloroethylchloroformate.<br><br>
Acetal-containing C-rings can be used as an alternative in this type of route with deprotection involving other methods, including the use of acidic conditions.<br>
Dimer Synthesis (Scheme 3)<br><br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
PBD dinners, as in the present invention, may be synthesized using the strategy developed for the synthesis of the protected PBD monomers. The synthesis routes illustrated in scheme 3 show compounds when the dimer linkage is of the formula -O-(CH2)n-O-, and may be readily modified for other dimer linkages. The step of dimer formation is normally carried out to form a bis(nitro acid) G'.   This compound can then be treated as compound G in either scheme 1 or scheme 2 above.<br>
The bis(nitro acid) G' may be obtained by nitrating (e.g. using 70% nitric acid) the bis(carboxylic acid). This can be synthesised by alkylation of two equivalents of the relevant benzoic acid with the appropriate diiodoalkane under basic conditions. Many <br><br>
benzoic acids are commercially available and others can be synthesised by conventional methods. Alternatively, the relevant benzoic acid esters can be joined together by a Mitsunobu etherification with an appropriate alkanediol, followed by nitration, and then hydrolysis (not illustrated).<br>
An alternative synthesis of the bis(nitro acid) involves oxidation of the bis(nitro aldehyde), e.g. with potassium permanganate. This can be obtained in turn by direct nitration of the bis(aldehyde), e.g. with 70% HNO3. Finally, the bis(aldehyde) can be obtained via the Mitsunobu etherification of two equivalents of the benzoic aldehyde with the appropriate alkanediol.<br>
Alternative routes to PBDs<br>
Alternative methods of synthesising N10 protected PBDs are disclosed WO 2005/023814,<br>
which is incorporated herein, and which describes the use of isocyanate intermediates.<br>
Introduction of C2 aryl substituent: introducing leaving group at C2<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The C2 aryl substituent may be in place in compounds of formula IV, by starting with the appropriate material, in which case the N10 may be deprotected to yield the desired compound (see below). Alternatively, the following method can be used where R12 is a protected hydroxy group. Following cyclisation to form the B-ring, the C1 1 -alcohol IV is then preferably re-protected, by conventional means to provide Illb. For example, if R11 is TBS, the protection can take place by reacting IV with TBSOTf and 2,6-lutidine. Cleavage of the C2-protecting group from Illb then provides the C2 alcohol. For example, where the<br>
C2 protecting group (R14) is acyl, this deprotection may be performed by addition of an aqueous solution of K2CO3.<br>
This reprotection at the C11 position and deprotection of the C2 alcohol allows subsequent reaction of selectively the C2 alcohol position leaving the C11 position unaffected. The C2-alcohol may then be oxidized to the ketone Nib. Preferably this oxidation is performed under Swern conditions, in good yield. However, other oxidation methods involving TRAP or the Dess Martin reagent also provide the ketone in good yield.<br>
R"12 in the compound of formula II may be -OSO2CH3, -OS02(CnF2n+1) where n=0,1 or 4, or -OSO2RS, in which case the conversion from Illb may be achieved by treatment with the appropriate anhydride. For example, if R"1Z is trfilate that reaction with trifluoromethanesutfonic anhydride in DCM in the presence of pyridine.<br>
R"12 in the compound of formula II may also be -I or -Br, in which case the conversion from Illb may be achieved by reaction with hydrazine and iodine or bromine respectively.<br>
R"12 in the compound of formula II may also be -Cl, where the conversion from 1Mb may be achieved by reaction with a phosphorous oxychloride (e.g. POCI3).<br>
Introduction of C2 aryl substituent: Replacement of leaving group<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
This compound of formula II may be reacted under a variety of conditions to yield PBD precursor molecules with pendant groups coupled at the C2 position Ic.<br>
In particular, the use of palladium catalysed coupling is preferred, such as Suzuki, Stille and Heck coupling. The palladium catalyst may be any suitable catalyst, for example Pd(PPh3)4, Pd(OCOCH3)2, PdCI2, Pd(dba)3. The compounds which are coupled may be any suitable reactant, e.g. for Heck, alkenes with an sp2 H; for Stille, organostannanes; and for Suzuki, organoboron derivatives.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the invention, the coupling may be performed under microwave conditions. Typically, the palladium catalyst, such as Pd(PPh3)4, is solid supported, for example on polystyrene, to facilitate work-up and allow potential recycling of catalyst. Unreacted boronic acid can be sequestered following complete consumption of triflate using PS-DEAM, with a phase separator cartridge being used to isolate the coupling product. Such a method allows for the parallel synthesis of more than one (e.g. up to 10, 20 or 30) compound at the same time.<br>
The imine bond in the compound of formula Ic can be unprotected by standard methods to yield the unprotected compound Ib (which may be in its carbinolamine or carboinoiamine ether form , depending on the solvents used). For example if R10 is Alloc, then the deprotection is carried using palladium to remove the N10 protecting group, followed by the elimination of water. If R10 is Troc, then the deprotection is carried out using a Cd/Pb couple to yield the compound of formula Ib.<br>

Conversion to sulphur containing form<br>
The conversion of compounds of formula Ib to those of the present invention may be carried out by the addition of the appropriate bisulphite salt or sulphinate salt, followed by an appropriate purification step.

K562 cell line (MTT assay) 1 hour exposure<br>
K562 human chronic myeloid leukaemia cells were maintained in RPM1 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mM glutamine at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% C02 and were incubated with a specified dose of drug for 1 hour at 37°C in the dark. The incubation was terminated by centrifugation (5 min, 300 g) and the cells were washed once with drug-free medium. Following the appropriate drug treatment, the cells were transferred to 96-well microtiter plates (104 cells per well, 8 wells per sample). Plates were then kept in the dark at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The assay is based on the ability of viable cells to reduce a yellow soluble tetrazolium salt, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT, Aldrich-Sigma), to an insoluble purple formazan precipitate. Following incubation of the plates for 4 days (to allow control cells to increase in number by approximately 10 fold), 20 µL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well and the plates further incubated for 5 h. The plates were then centrifuged for 5 min at 300 g and the bulk of the medium pipetted from the cell pellet leaving 10-20 µL per well. DMSO (200 µL) was added to each well and the samples agitated to ensure complete mixing. The optical density was then read at a wavelength of 550 nm on a Titertek Multiscan ELISA plate reader, and a dose-response curve was constructed. For each curve, an IC50 value was read as the dose required to reduce the final optical density to 50% of the control value.<br>

Example 10: Anti tumour activity<br>
The following experiments was carried out under a project licence approved by the Home Office, London, UK, and UK CCCR guidelines (Workman, P., et a/., British Journal of Cancer, 77, 1-10 (1998)) were followed throughout.<br>
LOX IMVI (human melanomas) were grown subcutaneously in nude mice (B&amp;K Universal, Hull, UK). Tumours were transplanted as single tumour fragments in the flank by trocar. Groups of 8 tumour-bearing mice were treated with ZC423 at the previously established <br>
single intravenous (iv) maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 3mgkg'-1 using 5% DMA/saline as the vehicle. Control mice (n=8) were treated with vehicle alone.<br>
Treatment commenced when tumours could be reliably measured by calipers (mean dimensions 4 x 4mm) and therapeutic effects were assessed by daily caliper measurements of the tumour and mouse weights. Tumour volumes were determined by<br>
the formula a2 x b/2 where a is the smaller and b is the larger diameter of the tumour. The results are shown in Fig. 1 as a graphs of relative tumour volume against time (■ ZC423; ♦ Control - solvent alone). The activity of ZC423 was shown to be statistically significant when assessed by Mann-Whitney analysis (as described, for example, in Essential Statistics 2nd Edition (1989), D.G.Rees, ISBN 0 412 32030 4, Chapman and Hall, London).<br>
Fig. 2 shows the results of the same test (● ZC423; ♦Control - solvent alone) but extended over a longer period, and with a larger scale for the Mean RTV. The control group was ceased at 16 days, at which point there were no tumour free mice, compared to the treated group where all animals were tumour free at 68 days.<br>
A study was carried out using OVCAR-5 (human ovarian tumours) under the same conditions as described above. The results are shown in Fig. 3 (●  ZC423; ♦Control -solvent alone). In this study the control group was ceased at 32 days.<br><br>
Example 11: Cross-linking and Solubility<br>
DNA Cross-linking<br>
Closed-circular pud 8 DNA was linearized with Hindlll, then dephosphorylated, and finally 5' end labeled with [γ32P]-ATP using polynucleotide kinase. Reactions containing 10 ng of DNA and drug were carried out in aqueous 1 x TEOA (25 mM triethanolamine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.2) buffer at a final volume of 50 uL at 37°C. Reactions were terminated by addition of an equal volume of stop solution (0.6 M NaOAc, 20 mM EDTA, 100 µg/mL tRNA) followed by precipitation with ethanol. Following centrifugation of the samples, the supernatants were discarded and the pellets were dried by lyophilization. Samples were resuspended in 10 uL of alkaline denaturing buffer (4mg bromophenol blue, 600 mg sucrose and 40 mg NaOH) and vortexed for three minutes at room temperature. The non-denatured controls were re-suspended in 10µL of standard sucrose loading dye (2.5 mg bromophenol blue, 2.5 mg xylene cyanol blue and 4 g sucrose). Both samples and controls were loaded directly onto an agarose gel.<br>
Electrophoresis was performed on a 0.8% submerged horizontal agarose gel, 20 cm in length for 16 hours at 38-40 V in 1 x TAE running buffer (2.42 g Tris Base, 0.372 g EDTA, 0.571ml glacial acetic acid). Gels were dried under vacuum for 80 minutes at 80°C on a Savant SG210D SpeedGel gel dryer onto one layer of Whatman 3MM with a layer of DE81 filter paper underneath. An autoradiograph was obtained, after overnight exposure onto FujiRX x-ray film. The film bands were quantitated using a BioRad GS-670 imaging laser densitometer. The percentage of cross-linking was calculated by measuring the total DNA in each lane (the sum of the densities for the double-stranded and single-stranded bands) relative to the amount of density of double-stranded band alone. A dose response curve was derived by plotting drug concentration against the determined percentage level of cross-linked DNA, from which was derived the amount required to cross-link 50% of the DNA (XL50).<br>
