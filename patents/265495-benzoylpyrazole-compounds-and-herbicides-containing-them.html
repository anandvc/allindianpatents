The dose of the herbicide containing the compound of<br>
the present invention can not generally be defined, as it<br>
varies depending upon the weather conditions, the soil<br>
conditions, the type of the formulation, the type of the<br>

The mixing ratio of the compound of the present<br>
invention to the active compounds of other herbicides can<br>

amount of from 0.001 to 10,000 parts by weight,<br>
preferably from 0.01 to 1,000 parts by weight per one<br>
type of the active compound, based on 1 part by weight of<br>

5-Hydroxy-l-methylpyrazol-4-yl 3-(methoxycarbonyl) -<br>
2-methyl-4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl ketone (2 90 mg, 0.82<br>
mmol) was dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran (15 mL), and<br>
triethylamine (166 mg, 1.64 mmol) was added thereto. A<br>
solution (4 mL) of 96% S-ethyl chlorothiolformate (107<br>
mg) dissolved in dry tetrahydrofuran was added thereto<br>
little by little under cooling with ice water. The<br>
reaction mixture was stirred for 90 minutes while the<br>
reaction temperature was allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature. The reaction solution was poured into ice<br><br>
water, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate. The<br>
extract was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, and the<br>
solvent was distilled off under reduced pressure. The<br>
residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography<br>
(n-hexane:ethyl acetate=6:4) to obtain the desired<br>
product as an amorphous solid (202 mg, 0.46 mmol) (yield:<br>
56%) .<br>
