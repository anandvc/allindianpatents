				<td>FlELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the area of image forming apparatus, particUIarly to mUItifunctional peripherals (MFPs). ParticUIarly the present invention relates to a method for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) in the scanning process wherein pre-stored symbols or keywords will be replaced with the stored words or abbreviations stored in the memory according to the particUIar function carried out by the MFP.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Various methods have been introduced to make the work of stenographers easier, wherein the symbols, keywords or images are mapped to its corresponding words in the memory automatically when the symbols or keywords are encountered.<br>
In US Patent bearing no. US20050180633 titled “Implementing handwritten shorthand in a computer system” The patent publication describes a system and a method for expanding a handwritten shorthand script to a fUIl text script by the use of a set of executable programs. The patent publication describes an application on a computing device for expanding shorthand notations to fUIl text script. The patent publication mentions that a scanner may be used by a user to input data for the application. However, the patent publication does not specifically mention the use of the application in an MFP.<br>
2<br><br>
In another US Patent bearing no. US5466072 titled “Method and apparatus for recording and translating shorthand notes” The patent publication describes an application for entering a shorthand script through a keyboard and translating to fUIl-text notes in different languages. However, the patent publication does not describe scanning of handwritten shorthand notes for translation to fUIl-text script and recording.<br>
In another US Patent no. US5466072 titled “Shorthand notation and transcribing method” describes an application for storing, processing and transcribing a shorthand data to its fUIl-text version. The shorthand data is input through a keyboard. However, the patent publication does not describe scanning of handwritten shorthand script for transcription and storage.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention describes a method and a system for performing operations like scanning a shorthand script and conversion of the shorthand script to an expanded script for further editing. The method enables a user to customize a group of keywords generally used by the user. Presently, a system such as an optical card recognizer (OCR) or a scanner is required to scan the shorthand script. Further, a stenography system is required to convert the shorthand script to the expanded script. In the present invention, the user can perform the scanning of the shorthand script and conversion of the shorthand script to the expanded script using a mUItifunctional peripheral (MFP). The user can further edit the expanded script as<br>
3<br><br>
per the requirement. Additionally, the user can use the expanded script for other functions of the MFP, such as scan to email, etc.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method to scan and performing the abbreviation in an MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	adding customized keywords and abbreviations through scanning;<br>
(b)	forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard UI;<br>
(c)	mapping groups to Functions, through standard UI; and<br>
(d)	performing the abbreviation in scanned output if keyword is present in<br>
scanned data,<br>
wherein if the keyword is not present in the scanned data the process is ended without abbreviation.<br>
Adding customized keywords and abbreviation through scanning involves printing Keyword Defining Sheet from MFP through standard UI. Keyword Defining Sheet is a pre-stored sheet in MFP where keyword and abbreviation is entered. Adding customized keywords and abbreviation through scanning involves entering the Keyword and abbreviation and scanning the said sheet and storing the keyword list in MFP. Forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard UI involves entering the keyword group name. Forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard UI involves selecting Keyword from Keyword List and adding to the corresponding Group wherein each group is assigned to the various operations provided by the MFP. Mapping groups to Functions, through standard UI involves selecting a function for each group. The said function is Scan2email/fax/netsacn. A Keyword<br>
4<br><br>
defining Sheet provides space where in the “KEYWORDS” or “SYMBOLS” and their abbreviations to be filled is entered. After scanning Keyword Defining Sheet the KEYWORDS and their abbreviations are extracted through the OCR and stored in MFP memory.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the keyword entry sheet where keyword and abbreviation has to be entered.<br>
Figure 2 shows the keyword entry sheet with keyword filled to be scanned.<br>
Figure 3 is a flow chart which shows how to save the groups of the scanned keyword.<br>
Figure 4 is a flow chart showing how to map groups to functions.<br>
Figure 5 is a flow chart showing the working of the present invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It shoUId be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Referring to figure 1, it shows the keyword entry sheet which gives a provision to pre-store in MFP where keyword and abbreviation has to be entered.<br>
Figure 2 shows the keyword entry sheet with an example keyword and the corresponding abbreviation filled to be scanned where the letter ‘K’ stands for keyword and 'A' for abbreviation. In this example Samsung Electronics Corporation is the abbreviation of the keyword SEC.<br>
The user can also customize the MFP to abbreviate the Keywords in the operations provided by MFP depending on which function MFP is going to carry out for example scanning / faxing / netscan / PCScan / copying etc. The Keywords which are generic and are particUIar to an in-house business centre can be used and will<br>
6<br><br>
be made optional to be expanded or not.<br>
Eg: “SEC” -&gt; Samsung Electronics Corporation.<br>
In case of in-house Scan to Email (wherein the email ids are identified by the domain the MFP doesn't expand SEC whereas in case of mails to domains outside the organization it may be chose to expand.<br>
The invention provides a method wherein a special sheet (Sheet 1: Keyword Defining Sheet) is stored inside the MFP. This Sheet 1 will be printed thorough the request from any standard UI. The Sheet 1 provides space where in the “KEYWORDS” or “SYMBOLS” and their abbreviations to be filled. After that the user filled Sheet 1 is scanned and the KEYWORDS and their abbreviations are extracted through the OCR and stored in MFP memory, thus customizing the KEYWORDS being stored according to the business.<br>
Then the Keywords will be classified into GROUPS and can be mapped to the<br>
operation being performed.<br>
EG:<br>
Group1:<br>
Keyword 1<br>
Keyword2<br>
Etc.<br>
Group2:<br>
7<br><br>
Keyword3<br>
 Keyword4<br>
 Etc.<br>
For scan2email: Use Group Group1<br>
For FAX:	Use Group Group2.<br>
The invention can be thus broken into 3 major parts:<br>
1)	Adding customized keywords and abbreviations through scanning.<br>
2)	Forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard UI.<br>
3)	Mapping groups to Functions, through standard UI.<br>
Adding customized keywords and abbreviation through scanning:<br>
Steps:<br>
1)	Request for Keyword and abbreviation adding sheet (pre-stored sheet where<br>
keyword and abbreviation has to be entered) from MFP through standard UI which<br>
will get printed (Fig 1).<br>
2)	Enter the Keyword and abbreviation as shown in Fig 2.<br>
3)	Scan sheet and add keywords and abbreviations to MFP.<br>
Forming Groups of scanned keyword through standard UI<br>
Figure 3 is the flow chart showing the method to store the groups of scanned keyword.<br>
8<br><br>
Steps:<br>
1)	The first step is to enter the keyword group name.<br>
2)	Select Keyword from Keyword List and add to the corresponding Group.<br>
Each group can be assigned to the various operations provided by the MFP. For<br>
example group 1 can comprise of the keywords used for sending e-mail, group 2<br>
can contain the keywords that are to be used for sending fax etc.<br>
3)	Save Group.<br>
Mapping groups to Functions, through standard UI<br>
Figure 4 is the flow chart showing how to map groups to functions. As described above the groups can be assigned to the corresponding functions as required by the user.<br>
Steps:<br>
1)	Select Function (Scan2email/fax/netsacn.etc)<br>
2)	Select Group name to be mapped and save.<br>
Working of the invention<br>
Figure 5 is the flow chart showing the working of the present invention. Steps:<br>
1)	After inserting the sheet for scanning select the function.<br>
2)	Start scanning the image after setting the scan mode to abbreviate mode<br>
9<br><br>
3)	Map for Keywords present in data to the keyword present in scanned data<br>
(extracted through OCR) through any standard Image comparing mechanisms say<br>
overlay.<br>
4)	If keyword is present in scanned data perform the abbreviation in scanned<br>
output.<br>
5)	Perform the function (scanned output -Scan2email/fax/netsacn.etc).<br>
6)	If the keyword is not present in the scanned data end the process without<br>
abbreviation.<br>
An example of the invention may be as below.<br>
Eg: “SEC” -&gt; Samsung Electronics Corporation.<br>
In case of in house Scan to Email (wherein the email ids are identified by the domain the MFP doesn't expand SEC whereas in case of mails to domains outside the organization it may be chose to expand.<br>
MFP is a common device which is used in various business centers. Keywords may vary from one business centre to other. So a Customized way of having Keywords mapped to abbreviations will help the organization to a great extend.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is<br>
10<br><br>
therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br>
