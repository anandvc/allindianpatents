2.       Description of the Related Art<br>
In a multimedia database related to a multimedia application multimedia<br>
contents are typically represented by feature vectors. Similarity of objects<br>
is determined by a distance measurement defined by feature distances between the<br>
query vector and feature vectors in a feature vector space.<br>
To provide further precise retrievals, a distance measurement may be iteratively performed using collected information such as user feedback. However, a conventional search method does not consider how to iteratively perform a distance measurement according to varying factors in a large database. In particular, a conventional indexing method in a feature vector space has not addressed how to quickly perform a search in an environment that a distance measurement is changing, such as on-line retrieval. Thus, there still remains a need for accelerating a search in an environment that a distance measurement is varying.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main steps of an adaptive search method according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to Figures 1A and 1B. A database in which multimedia contents are stored is represented as a feature vector space. In this embodiment, the feature vector space is approximated with a plurality<br><br>
of hypercubes. Furthermore, assuming that M is a positive integer denoting the dimensionality of feature vectors used to describe an image/video object, and N is a positive integer denoting the number of objects in the database, feature vector F and feature vector Q of a query object Q are defined as F = [Fi1, Fi2,..., FiM ] and Q = [qil,qi2,...,qim] respectively. Here, the database is represented as a feature vector space and the feature vector Q of a query object Q is hereinafter called a query vector.<br>
First, a predetermined number of nearest candidate hypercubes are obtained by measuring the distance between a query vector and each of hypercubes (step 102). Then, K of nearest neighbor feature vectors are abort indicator by measuring the distance between the query vector and each of all feature vectors in the predetermined number of candidate hypercubes obtained in the step 102, where K is a positive integer (step 104). The distance between the query vector and each of the feature vectors is measured by calculating weighted Euclidean distance. The weighted Euclidean distance is calculated by Equation (1):<br>
d(Wt,Ft,Q)=(Q-F)TWt(Q-F)	-d)<br>
where W, is a full symmetric function matrix at iteration t and updated at every iteration.<br>
Then, for example, the user selects a plurality of multimedia contents similar to those that he or she desires to find among calculated multimedia contents and attempts a search again. Thus, feedback for changed search conditions can be provided from the user, which is called relevance feedback. According to the present invention, features for which feedback is provided from the user are reflected in a distance measurement for the next search, thereby changing distance measurement conditions.<br>
According to the present invention, approximation level filtering is performed using information from previous iteration t. Wt,C,(Wt), and Rtdenote a distance measurement function used in the previous iteration t, approximation regions that passed the previous iteration t or hypercubes in this embodiment, and vectors retrieved using Wt, respectively.<br>
FIG. 2 shows a pseudo code list for explaining the step of approximation level filtering. The approximation level filtering is performed using the information from the previous iteration t. Referring to FIG. 2, according to the pseudo codes, during the approximation level filtering, K'-th shortest distance is calculated for the K nearest neighbor feature vectors obtained according to the previous distance measurement according to the changed distance measurement where K' is a positive integer, and the calculated distance is set as rtuj (step 106). Furthermore, K'-th smallest lower bound is calculated for the predetermined number of candidate hypercubes obtained according to the previous distance measurement according to the changed distance measurement and set as Φtu+1 (step 108).<br>
Then, assuming that N is the number of objects or approximation regions in the approximated feature vector space or a positive integer denoting the number of hypercubes in this embodiment and i is a variable ranging from 1 to N, the distance L|(Wt+1) between each of the lower bounds of hypercubes in the feature vector space and a query vector and the distance Uj(Wt+1) between each of the upper bounds of the hypercubes in the feature vector space and the query vector are measured according to the changed new distance measurement (step 110). Furthermore, the K'-th smallest upper bound (j) is calculated (step 112).<br>
Next, the distance Li(W,+1) between the lower bound of i-th hypercube in the corresponding vector space and the query vector is compared with a minimum value min (Φru+1,Φtu+1) of the K'-th smallest upper bound Φ calculated in the step 112, rtu+1 and 0},"j (step 114). If the distance L|(Wt+1) is less than or equal to the minimum value min(Φru+1,tΦtu+1), a relevant hypercube is set as a candidate hypercube (step 116) and if not, the relevant hypercube is excluded (step 118).<br>
Referring to pseudo code 202 in FIG. 2, it is determined whether or not the distance Li(Wt+1) between the lower bound of i-th hypercube in the corresponding vector space and the query vector is smaller than all of the K'-th smallest upper bound Φ,rtu+1 and Φtu+1 and relevant hypercube Pi is selected as a candidate hypercube as shown pseudo code 204. Referring to pseudo code 206, if requirements shown in the pseudo code 202 are satisfied, the relevant hypercube Pi is selected as a candidate hypercube, and the upper bound $ is updated referring to the distance Uj(Wt+1) (step 120).<br><br>
Next, assuming that N is a positive integer denoting the number of objects in the database or hypercubes, it is determined whether i reaches N (step 124), and if i does not reach N, the steps 114 -124 are repeated until the approximation level filtering is performed on all N hypercubes.<br>
According to the method described above, for a hypercube to be set as a candidate hypercube, the hypercube must meet new requirements determined from the previous distance measurement information such as the pseudo code 202. Thus, requirements for selecting candidate hypercubes are further limited, thereby reducing the number of selected candidate hypercubes.<br>
Then, data level filtering is performed. During the filtering, a distance measurement between each of all feature vectors in the candidate hypercubes and the query vector is performed (step 126) to determine K' nearest neighbor vectors as found feature vectors depending on the result of the distance measurements performed in the step 126 thereby completing a search (step 128).  In this case, the number of candidate hypercubes is reduced, which reduces the computational complexity in measuring the distance between each of all feature vectors in the candidate cubes and the query vector. Thus, a search speed can be improved when searching for a feature vector having features similar to a query vector.<br>
That is, according to the search method as described, the number of candidate approximation regions in a varying distance measurement is reduced thereby improving the search speed, and if new approximation regions are included, database can be updated fast.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of this invention has been described with reference to the example that the feature vector space is partitioned into hypercubes and approximated, the invention is also applicable to feature vector spaces indexed by other known index structures such as R-tree, R tree, SR-tree<br>
and X-tree. It will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
The search method according to the present invention can be written as a program executed on a personal or server computer. The program codes and code segments constructing the program can be easily inferred by computer programmers<br>
in the industry. Furthermore, the program can be stored in a computer-readable recording medium. The recording medium includes a magnetic recording medium, an optical recording medium, and a radio medium.<br>
According to the present invention, the number of approximation regions is reduced during a varying distance measurement, which improves a search speed.<br>
