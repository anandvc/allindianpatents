"THE METHOD FOR PREPARING A MORPHOLINE COMPOUND"<br>
PHARMACIA   8s   UPJOHN   COMPANY   LLC,   a   Delaware   corporation,   of   301, Henrietta Street, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001, United States of America,<br><br><br>
1<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing a morpholine compound of the following formula<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
United States Patent 4,229,449, issued 21 October, 1980, discloses compounds<br>
of formula (A)<br>
wherein<br>
N and nl are independently, 1, 2 or 3;   .<br>
Each of the groups R and Rl, which may be the same or different, is hydrogen;<br>
halogen;   halo-Cl-C6   alkyl;   hydroxy;   Cl-C6alokoxy;   C1-C6   alkyl   optionally<br>
substituted;   aryl-   C1-C6   alkyl   optionally   substituted;   aryl-   C1-C6   alkoxy<br>
optionally substituted; -N02; NR5R6 wherein R5 and R6 are, independently,<br>
hydrogen or G1-C6 alkyl, or two adjacent R groups or two adjacent Rl groups,<br>
taken together, form a -0-CH2-0- radical;<br>
R2 is hydrogen; CI-CI 2 alkyl optionally substituted, or aryl-Cl-C6 alkyl; each<br>
of the groups R3 and R4, which may be identical or different,, is hydrogen, Cl-<br>
C6alkyl optionally substituted, C2-C4 alkenyl, C2-C4alkynyl, aryl-Cl-C4alkyl<br>
optionally substituted, C3-C7cycloalkyl optionally substituted, or R3 and R4<br>
with the nitrogen  atom  to which they are  bounded form  a pentatomic or<br>
hexatomic saturated or unsaturated, optionally substituted, heteromonocyclic<br>
radical optionally containing other heteroatoms belonging to the class of O, S<br>
and N;<br>
or R2 and R4, taken together, form a -CH2-CH2-radical;<br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The compounds are disclosed to process antidepressant activity.<br>
2<br><br>
In particular, United States Patent 4,229,449 discloses the compound: 2-[α-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine:<br>
OS<br><br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, which possess useful antidepressant properties. This compound is also known as Reboxetine.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, United States patent 5,068,433 (issued 26 Novembei 1991) and related United States patent 5,391,735 (issued 21 February 1995) disclose processes and intermediates useful for preparing single diastereomers of compounds of formula VIb:<br><br>
(VIb)<br>
wherein R is C1-C6 alkoxy or tri-halomethyl. These diastereomers are disclosed to be useful intermediates for preparing compounds of formula A, including Reboxetine. The processes disclosed in these patents and in U.S. patent 4,229,449, however, are inefficient and provide a low overall yield of compounds of formula A when carried out on a commercial scale. Additionally the processes require the use of expensive reagents and require significant production times. Thus, it is not economical to prepare compounds of formula A on a commercial scale using the processes disclosed in these patents.<br>
Accordingly, there is currently a need for improved processes for preparing compounds of formula (A), and for preparing intermediates useful for preparing compounds of formula (A). Ideally, the improved processes should utilize inexpensive reagents, be faster to carry out, or provide improved intermediate or overall yields compared to existing processes. Such improvements would facilitate the commercial scale production of compounds of formula (A).<br><br>

Preferred salts are disclosed to be acid salts (e.g. the hydrochionc acid or methane sulfonic acid salt) formed with the amine ,,group -NR3R4. Accordingly, the methods of the invention that yield a compound of formula (A) may also optionally further comprise preparing a salt of the compound of formula (A). Pharmaceutical ly acceptable salts may be obtained using standard procedures well known in the art.<br>
The epoxidation of an optionally substituted trans-cinnamic alcohol of formula:<br><br>
to give an epoxide of formula la can conveniently be carried out using a suitable epoxidizing agent, for example, vanadic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide, vanadium(acetylacetonate): and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, or a peroxy acid such as perbenzoic acid, m-chloroperbenzoic, peracetic acid, pertrifluoroacetic acid or mono- or di-peroxy-phthalic acid. The reaction can be carried out in any suitable solvent or combination of solvents, for example, in a hydrocarbon, a halogenated hydrocarbon, a linear or branched ether, a carboxylic acid, or an ester. Specific solvents include benzene, toluene, chloroform, methylene chlonde, diethyl ether, dioxane, acetic acid, and ethyl acetate.  Preferably the reaction is carried out in methylene chloride or ethyl acetate.  More preferably in methylene chlonde. The reaction can be carried out at any suitable temperature from the freezing point to the reflux temperature of<br><br>
10<br><br>
the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 50 °C More preferably at a temperature in the range of about 5 °C to about 25  °C.<br>
United States patent 5,068,433 and related United States patent. 5,391.735 disclose thai an epoxide of fbrmula lb can be prepared from trans-cinnamic alcohol using a suitable oxidizing agent, for instance vanadic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide, or a peroxy acid such as, e.g., perbenzoic acid,/m-ch.loroperbenzoic, peracetic, mono- or di-peroxy-phthalic, or peroxy-trifluoroacetic acid. At Example 1, these patents specifically exemplify the preparation of an epoxide of formula lb by the oxidation of/trans -cinnamic alcohol with m-chloroperbenzoic acid. The oxidation of rranj-cinnamic alcohol with m-chloroperbenzoic acid was also reported by P. Melloni et al. Tetrahedron, 1985, 41, no. 7, 1393-1399.<br>
m-Chloroperbenzoic acid is expensive to use on a commercial scale. Thus, a different epoxidation reagent would be preferred for the commercial scale production of a compound of formula (A). Studies with mono-peroxy-phthalic acid have shown that this reagent can be used to prepare epoxide lb on a commercial scale. However, the preparation of mono-peroxy-phthalic acid from phthalic anhydride and hydrogen peroxide is time consuming. Additionally, the epoxidation reaction with mono-peroxy-phthalic acid generates a large amount of solid phthalic acid by-product that must be filtered from the product mixture. This filtration step is time consuming and generates a large amount of aqueous and solid wastes. Thus, m-chloroperbenzoic acid and mono-peroxy-phthalic acid are not ideally suited for the commercial scale epoxidation of irans-cinnamic alcohol.<br>
It has been discovered that the epoxidation of cinnamyl alcohol can conveniently be carried out on a commercially scale using peracetic acid. Peracetic acid is less expensive and, as a liquid, is easier to handle on a large scale than m-chloroperbenzoic acid, which is a solid. Additionally, the use of peracetic acid reduces the time required for preparing epoxide lb, by eliminating the need to prepare mono-peroxy-phthalic acid; Deracetic acid also substantially reduces the amount of aqueous and solid waste generated by :he epoxidation reaction compared to the reaction with mono-peroxy-phthalic acid.<br><br>
11<br><br>
Accordingly, the invention provides a method for preparing an epoxide of formula la:<br>
(R.)n<br>
fa comprising oxidizing a corresponding optionally substituted trans-cirtnamic alcohol with peracetic acid.  The epoxide la is highly sensitive to decomposition by strong acids. Commercial peracetic acid is stabalized with, sulfuric acid. Accordingly, the peracetic acid-should be treated with a suitable base (e.g. sodium or potassiun acetate) prior to use; or the reaction can conveniently be run in the presence of a suitable solid base (e.g. sodium or potassium carbonate).  Preferably, the reaction is carried out on a commercial scale. Preferably, the reaction is carried out in methylene chlonde and at a temperature below about 30 °C.<br>
The reaction of an epoxide of formula la with an optionally substituted phenol to give a diol of formula IIa can conveniently be carried out using a suitable base, for example, aqueous sodium or potassium hydroxide, sodium hydride, or potassium hydride. The reaction can be carried out in any suitable solvent or combination of solvents, for example, in a hydrocarbon, a halogenated hydrocarbon, or a linear or branched ether, such as benzene, toluene, tetrahydrofuran, methylene chloride, diethyl ether, or dioxane. The reaction can be carried out at any suitable temperature from the freezing point to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 100 °C.  More preferably at a temperature in the range of about 20 °C to about 50 °C.    Preferably, the reaction can be carried out under phase transfer conditions using a suitable phase transfer catalyst (e.g. tributyLmethylammonium chloride) as illustrated in Example 2.<br>
P. Melloni et al. Tetrahedron, 1985, 4], no. 7, 1393-1399 discloses the isolation of the compound of formula II (Figure 1) by recrystallization from isopropyl ether. It has been discovered that the compound of formula II can conveniently be isolated by recrystallization from methyl :tert-butylether (MTBE). MTBE is less expensive and is less prone to the formation of explosive peroxides than isobutyl ether. Thus, the compound of formula II can preferably be isolated by recrystallization from MTBE.<br><br>
12<br><br>
The protection of the primary hydroxyl group in a diol of formula Ila to form mono-protected compound of formula lUa wherein P is a silyl-liaked protecting group can bi performed using any suitable silylating reagent (e.g. tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride, trimethylsilyl chloride, /erz-butyldiphenylsily) chloride, tnethylsilyl chloride, triisopropylsily chloride! hexamethyldisilazane with or without trimethylsilyl chloride, or triphenylsilyl chloride). The reaction can be carried out in any suitable solvent or combination of solvents, for example, in a hydrocarbon, an ester, a halogenated hydrocarbon, or a linear or branched ether, such as benzene, toluene, chloroform, methylene chloride, diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, or dioxane.  The reaction can be carried out at any suitable temperature that allows for the selective protection of the primary alcohol over the secondary alcohol, provided the temperature is above the freezing point of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is earned out at a temperature below -5°C. More preferably, the reaction is carried out at a temperature below -10 °C or below -15 °C. Most preferably, the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about -15 °C to about -25 °C.  Other. suitable silylating reagents and reaction conditions are known in the art, for example see Greene, T:W.; Wutz, P.G.M. "Protecting Groups In Organic Synthesis" second edition, 1991, New York, John Wiley &amp; sons. Inc.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, United States patents.5,068,433 and 5,391,735 disclose that a diol of formula llb can be esterified to give a compound of formula Illb wherein R, is the residue of a carboxylic acid. Unfortunately, protection of the primary-alcohol of the diol, under the conditions described in these patents, proceeds with low selectivity; up to 13% of the ester at the secondary alcohol is also formed.  Formation of the mono p-nitrobenzoate at the secondary alcohol results in a direct diminution in the yield of the amine of formula VPo. Formation of the mono p-nitrobenzoate at the secondary alcohol also yields the unwanted diastereomer of the amine of formula VTb as a contaminant in the amine product. Additionally, formation of the bis p-nitrobenzoate causes a reduced yield of the amine of formula VIb, and gives the bis p-nitrobenzoate as a contaminant in the product amine. Due to the presence of these unwanted contaminants, there is a need for extensive purification of the amine product, which is time consuming and causes an additional reduction in yield. Thus, the processes described in in U.S. Patents 5,068,433 and 5.391,735 are not idealy suited for commercial scale production of the amine of formula Via.<br>
It has unexpectedly been found thai the primary alcohol in the diol of formula llb can be selectively protected in high yield using a silyl protecting group.  In<br><br>
13<br><br><br>
particular, it has been found that the primary alcohol can be selectively protected with a trimethylsilyl group. Reaction with trimethylsilyl chloride is almost completely selective, in both reaction with the primary vs. the secondary alcohol, and. in the absence of formation of the bis-trimethylsilyl ether. As a result the yield of amine Vllb obtained from the process of the invention is significantly increased over the yield obtained using the previously known processes. Additionally, trimethylsilyl chloride is less expensive than/p-hitrobenzoyl chloride, is more readily available, and is easier to handle on a large scale, since trimethylsily chloride is a liquid and-nitrobenzoyl chloride is a solid.<br>
There is little precedence for the selectivity seen in the reaction of lib with trimethylsilyl choride. Trimethylsilyl groups have been used extensively for the derivatization of alcohols, primarily in analytical-applications where the intended result is exhaustive silylation. Considerable selectivity has been seen for reactions of secondary alcohols in different environments (for example see H.J. Schneider, R. Homing. Leibigs Ann. Chem., 1974, 1864-1871 and E.W. Yankee et al..7. Am. Chan. Soc, 1974, 5865). However, relative rate information for the reactions of primary and secondary alcohols is unavailable, and the lirurature is devoid of examples of the selective protection of a primary alcohol with trimethylsilyl chloride in the presence of a secondary alcohol. Examples for the reaction of a primary alcohol in the presence of a secondary alcohol are reported with hexamathyldisilazane catalyzed by trimethylsilyl chloride (J. Cossy, P. Pale, Tet. Lett. 1987, 6039-6040), and by reaction with hexamethyldisilazane catalysed by metal chlorides (H Firouzabadi, at al, Syn. Comm., 1997, 2709-2719) where the best selectivity was 85:3:12. primary:secondary: bis -ether).<br>
The selective protection of the primary alcohol can be accomplished using a silyl protecting group (preferably trimethylsilyl chloride) at a low temperature. It has also been determined that the migration of the silyl protecting group can be prevented by 1) maintaining the protected compound of formula IIIa at a low temperature throughout the conversibn:from a compound of formula Ila to a compound of formula Va and 2) by carrying out the required sequence of reactions over a short period of time (e.g. less that about 5 hours, and preferably less than about 4, about 3, or about 2 hours). As illustrated in Example 6, this can conveniently be accomplished by carrying out the conversion of the diol offormula Ila to the compound offormula IIIa, IVa and Va in one reactor, without isolating the intermediates of formula IIIa, IVa.<br><br>

A preferred reactive derivative of a sulfonic acid is methanesulfonyl chloride.   The reaction can conveniently be carried out in the presence of a suitable base (e.g. triethyl amine or pyridine).

P. Melloni et al. Tetrahedron, 1985, 41, no. 7, 1393-1399 also disclose the conversion of a specific compound<br><br>
16<br><br>
formula IVb to the corresponding epoxide of formula Vb by treatment with sodium droxide in dioxane (see page 1397).<br>
When carried out on a large scale (aproxirhately 165 kg), this reaction is slow (18 hours), and removal.of the dioxane is difficult due to its high boiling point and high freezing point (mp 11.8 °C). Thus, the distillation can require one or two days, and there is a risk the dioxane will freeze in the apparatus during the distillation, causing damage to the condensers. In addition, dioxane is a carcinogen and is toxic.<br>

P. Melloni et al. Tetrahedron, 1985, 41, no. 7, 1393-1399, at page 1399, disclose that a morpholinone of formula IX (Figure 1) can be reduced to the corresponding morpholine (Reboxetine) by adding a toluene solution containing 2.96 equivalents of R£D-AL (sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aIuminum hydride) to a solution of the morphoiinone.<br><br>
19<br><br><br>
When this reaction is carried out on a large scale (approximately 25 kg of morpholinone), the reaction product is typically contaminated with 0.6 to 1% of the following impurity:<br><br>
For the final drug product of formula (A) to comply with regulatory requirements in some countries, the concentration of this inpurity in the final product must be less than 0.1%. Removal of this impurity is difficult, but can be accomplished using a controlled pH extraction at about pH 5.2. During this extraction, however, 20-30% of the compound of formula (A) is typically lost and cannot be readily recovered.<br>
It has been determined that the quantity of impurity that results from the . reduction can be significantly reduced by adding a solution of the morpholinone IXa to a solution containing an excess (e.g. about 5 equivalents) of the sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride. Using this procedure, the reaction has been found to directly yield Reboxetine free base containing less than 0.1% of the impurity. This material can be used directly, without carrying out a controlled pH extraction. This reduces processing time and eliminates the loss of 20-30% of the product.<br>
Use of less than 5 equivalents of the reducing agent was found to reduce the yield for the reaction. Thus, the reduction is preferably carried out using at least about 4 equivalents ofs sodium bis(2~methoxyethoxy)alurninum hydride, or another suitable reducing agent. More preferably, the reduction is carried out using at least about 5 equivalents of a suitable reducing agent (e.g. at least about 5 to about 10 equivalents of sodium bis(2-methoxyethoxy)aluminum hydride). Preferably, the reducing agent is not lithium aluminum hydride.<br>
