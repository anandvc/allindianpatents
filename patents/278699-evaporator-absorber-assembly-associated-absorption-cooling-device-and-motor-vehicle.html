Evaporator/absorber assembly, associated absorption cooling<br>
device and motor vehicle<br>
The present invention relaoes to an evaporator/absorber assembly of the type comprising:<br>
-	a liquid cooling fluid evaporator which has an upstream 1iquid cooling fluid supply in1ez,<br>
-	a gaseous cooling fluid absorber which .is connecied to the evaporator and which has an upscream liquid absorbent fluid supply iniet.<br>
An evaporator/absorber assembly of the above-mentioned type is intended to be arranged in an absorption cooling device placed in a motor vehicle in order to provide the frigories required for the climate-control of this vehicle.<br>
WO-A-01/18463 discloses an absorption cooling device comprising a generator in which a mixed fluid comprising a cooling fluid and an absorbent fluid is separated in order to obtain a gaseous current of cooling fluid, and a liquid current of absorbent fluid.<br>
This device further comprises a cooling fluid condenser which receives the gaseous current and which allows the cooling fluid to be reliquefied. This device comprises a cooling fluid evaporator which is connected to the condenser and in which the liquid cooling fluid from the condenser is evaporated using a nozzle. This evaporation produces frigories which are used for the purposes of cooling, via a cooling system which is placed in a heat-exchange relationship with a climate-control system.<br>
 <br>
The evaporated cooling fluid is conveyed to an absorber which receives a liquid current of absorbent fluid. The liquid current is sprayed in the absorber in order to form very fine drops which absorb the evaporated cooling fluid.<br>
A mixed liquid comprising the cooling fluid and the absorbent fluid is collected in the base of the absorber to be conveved to the generator.<br>
Such a device efficiently produces frigories which can be used in a climate-control assembly, without using a cooling<br>
fluid which is harmful to the environment.<br>

device according to the invention;<br>
 <br>

of the casing of the evaporator/absorber assembly of Figure 2;<br>
-	Figure 5 is a section along the horizontal plane V-V of a<br>
detail of Figure 3.<br>
The first absorptior cooling device 11 according to the invention, illustrated in Figure 1, is, for example, arranged in a motor vehicle. The vehicle comprises in particular a passenger space 15 and a passenger space climate-control assembly 17 which is placed in a heat exchange relationship with the device 11.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the device 11 comprises a device 33 for generating cooling fluid and absorbent fluid by separating a mixed fluid, a condenser 35 for evaporat-. d cooling fluid and an evaporator/absorber assembly 37.<br>
The generator 33 comprises a chamber 39 which is intended to receive the mixed fluid formed by an admixture of liquid cooling fluid and liquid absorbent fluid, and heating means 41.<br>
The absorbent fluid is formed, for example, by a solution of lithium bromide and the cooling fluid is formed by water.<br>
In a variant, the absorbent fluid is formed by water and the cooling fluid by ammonia solution.<br>
 <br>
The heating means 41 comprise, for example, an engine cooling liquid circulation con chair comprising a region 42 which is arranged in the chamber 3 9   in   order to place the engine cooling liquid in a heat-exchange relationship with the mixed fluid contained in the chamber 3 9.<br>
The condenser 35 is connected to the generator 33 by means of a conduit 47 for passage of evaporated cooling fluid.<br>
The condenser 35 is arranged in the front face (not illustrated) of the vehicle on the radiator of the engine cooling liquid, upstream with respect to the radiator in the flow direction of air in the front face.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 2, the assembly 37 comprises a sealed casing 43, a plate-type evaporator 45 and a plate-type absorber 47 which are arranged in. the sealed casing 43. The assembly 37 further comprises, as illustrated in Figure 1, a cooling system 49 which is intended to transmit the kilogram calories produced in the evaporator 45 and a coolie g system 51 of the absorber 47.<br>
The casing 43 is substantially parallelepipedal. it delimits an inner space 53 which is closed at the top by a cover 55 and, at the bottom, by a base wall 57 which is fixed in a lower portion of the casing. The base wall 57 is constructed using a flexible material. The wall 57 delimits a plurality of horizontal through-holes 59 wh-ch open in the inner space 53.<br>
The evaporator 45 comprises 
 <br>
planes 61 upstream, and a liquid cooling fluid collector 55 for collecting the liquid coding fluid downstream of each plate 51. The evaporator 51 further comprises means 57 for preventing the liquid cooling fluid from flowing back towards the inner space JZ .<br>
The plates 51 are arranged vertically in the inner space 5 3 in parallel planes which are spaced transversely from  left to right in Figure 2. In order to simplify the drawing, only one plate 61 has been illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
Each plate 61 extends between an upper upstream edge 69 which is retained in abutment against the cover 55 and a lower downstream edge 71 which is engaged in the collector 65 via a corresponding aperture 59.<br>
Each plate 61 defines a space which substantially comprises a porous member, for example, of the open-cell foam type or of the type with a randomly drawn surface. The porous member may have a porosity of substantially between 80% and 99% and preferably 93%. It may also comprise a density of openings of between 8 pores per centimetre and 40 pores per centimetre and preferably 16 pores per centimetre. Finally, the porous member may have a rough density of between 0.01 g.citf3 and 1 g. cm'3  and preferably 0.2 g.cirf3.<br>
Each plate 61 defines, at one side and the other of the thickness thereof,   two opposing vertical planar gas transfer surfaces 73A, 73B. Each surface 73A, 73B extends in the inner space 53 between the cover 55 and the base wall 57. The vertical surfaces 73A, 73B are connected together at one side and the other of the plate 61 via vertical lateral surfaces<br>
 <br>
74 which 3.re located on the edge of each plate 51 and which <br>
The vertical surfaces "A. "33 may comprise a specific<br>
xhiist retaining liquids. They may comprise, for example, a grid of the stainless steeJ type with fine holes of between 0.01 mm and 1 mm in diameter produced with a wire of between O.Oi mm and 1 mm in diameter. The diameter of the fine holes is preferably equal to or less than 1 m in order to take advantage from the phenomena of capillarity. The vertical surfaces 73A, 73B may also comprise a membrane of the GORE-TEX®, nylon, polyethylene or polypropylene type. Finally, it may be envisaged that the vertical surfaces 73A, 73B result from a local modification of the porous member of each plate 61 over approximately 1 mm of thickness with the density of the pores per centimetre being increased to, for example, 100 pores per centimetre and preferably 50 pores per centimetre.<br>
The distributor 63 is connected to the condenser 3 5 via a liquid cooling fluid supply conduit 75 illustrated in Figure 1. As illustrated in Figure 2, it comprises an end-piece 77 which is for connecting to the conduit 75 and which delimits a cooling fluid supply inlet 79 for the evaporator 51. The distributor 53 further defines a plurality of channels 80 which are arranged in the cover 55 and which connect the supply inlet 79 to the upper edges 69 of each plate 61.<br>
The collector 65 comprises, for each plate 61, a receptacle 81 which opens in an upward direction via an opening with a horizontal cross-section which is substantially equal to the horizontal cross-section of an aperture 59 and a common end-piece 83 for discharge of liquid cooling fluid.<br>
 <br>
Each receptacle £1 is ticoel under the base v;al 1 3~ i:o = sealed manner by means of ?.n adhesive joint.<br>
a corresponding aperture 5 3 so that each receptacle 31 receives a downstream region 8? of che plate 61 In the region of ohe lower downstream edge ~1 thereof.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4, each receptacle 81 comprises a base wall 85 which is inclined in a downward direction and towards the left in Figure 4, in the direction of the discharge end-piece 83 in which all the receptacles 81 open.<br>
The end-piece 83 delimits a lower downstream outlet 87 for discharge of liquid cooling fluid. The end-piece 83 protrudes in  a  downward direction from a left-hand edge of the casing 43 in Figure 4. In this example, the end-piece 83 of the collector 65 is connected to the liquid coolant fluid supply-conduit 75 via a recirculation conduit 88 which can be seen in Figure 1 and which is provided with a pump (not illustrated).<br>
The means 67 for preventing backflow comprise, for each plate 61, a partition liner 91 which surrounds the plate 61 and a porous pad 93 interposed between each collector 65 and the space 53. Of course, between each plate 61 and each partition liner 91, there may be surfaces 73A and 73B in accordance with one of the variants explained above.<br>
As illustrated in Figures 2 and 5, each liner 91 comprises partition walls 95A, 95B which are pressed, respectively, on the gas transfer surfaces 73A, 7 3B and which are connected to<br>
 <br>
each ocher by means o: lateral skirts 9&gt;A, 9 .'B attached ~o each other in a sealed manner over<br>
rfhich are<br>
, a plurality of horizontal openings 99 which extend substantially over the entire width of the plate 61. Each wall 35A, 95B comprises, for each opening 93, an inclined guiding fin 101. The wall thus has a structure referred to as "clere-story".<br>
The fins 101 protrude relative to the surface 73A, 73B. in an upward direction and away from the surface 73A, 73B facing each opening 99, from the lower edge defining each opening 99. Preferably, the spacing of the fins 101 relative to each surface 73A, 73B is between 0.5 and 5 mm in order to adapt to the size of the drops which may form. In the case of this example, fins 101 whose spacing is substantially equal to 2 mm and thickness is substantially equal to 1 mm allow the majority of droi ■:-: to be guided.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 3, each wall 95A,   95B thr&gt;v delimits on the corresponding surface 73A, 73B a plurality of regions 103 which are covered by the wall 95A, 95B and a plurality of uncovered regions 105 for passage of gas.<br>
In this Figure 3, it is also possible to see a downstream covered region 103A which extends from the base wall r ' to a first downstrec-m opening 99A which forms the uncovered region 105A above and remote from the base wall 57, in order to prevent the liquid cooling fluid from flowing back from the collector 65 towards the inner space £3 owing to the<br>
 <br>
associated inclined guiding fin 101. The downstream region 103A extends over the entire width of the plate -51.<br>
Preferably, according co the invention,- each wall 9 5A, 9 53 comprises an open "clere-story" structure only over the first downstream covered region I03A and uncovered region 105A which is used to guide towards the plate 61 any drops present on the surfaces 73A and 733, respectively. Each wall 95A, 953 preferably comprises, over rhe remainder of the surface thereof, that is to say, as far as the upstream region 69, v mesh of polymer, for example, of the cell type, whose configuration and distribution is capable of strengthening the porous member of each plate 61 whilst providing an opening surface which is at least equal to 50% of each surface 73A, 73B.<br>
Each wall 95A, 95B comprises an upper continuation 107 which can be seen in Figure 2 and which is inserted in the cover 55, and a lower continuation 109 which can be seen in Figure 3 and which is interposed between the receptacle 81 and the lower region 89 of the plate 61.<br>
Each plate 61 is thus wedged in the casing 43 oy the partition liner 91 thereof.<br>
Each porous pad 93 is formed by the	region 89 of the plate 61<br>
inserted into the receptacle 81. In	a variant, a porous pad<br>
93 is formed in a material which is	separate from than of the<br>
plate 61.<br>
The absorber 47 comprises a i lurality of plates 111, a distributor 113 for absorbent fluid and a collector 115 for mixed fluid.<br>
 <br>
mixed flui6.  tzom f 1 owing back inn.-_,   the inner space 53.<br>
The places 111 may have a stricture v.'hich is identical to chat of the gas transfer plates 61 and will not be described in detail. They are arranged   in the inner space 53, paralie] with the transfer plates 61 and are mounted so as to surround each face of each plate 51. Only two plates 111 at the ends of the casing 43 are illustrated in Figure 2,<br>
The plates 111 delimit, at one side and the other of their thickness, respective surfaces 13 9A, 119B for passage of gas. The vertical surfaces 119A, 119B may comprise a specific material which is capable of allowing the gases to pass whilst retaining the liquids. They may comprise, for example, a grid of the stainless steel type with fine holes of between 0.1 mm and 1 mm in diameter produced with a wire of between 0.01 mm and 1mm in diameter. The diameter of the fine holes is preferably equal to or greater than 0.1 mm in order to prevent salts from obstructing chem. The vertical surfaces 119A, l.'9B may also comprise a membrane of the GORE-TEX®, nylon, polyethylene, or polypropylene type. Finally, it may be envisaged that the vertical surfaces 119A, 119B result from a local modification of the porous member of each plate 111 over approximately 1 mm of thickness with the pore density per centimetre being increased to, for example, 100 pores per centimetre and preferably 50 pores per centimetre.<br>
Each surface 73A, 73B of a transfer plate 61 is located facing a gas passage surface 119A, 119B of a plate 111. The surfaces 73A, 73B and 119A, 119B together delimit, with the base wall 57 and the cover 55, a chamber 121 for migration of<br>
 <br>
gaseous cooling fluid from che surface "A, "3B to the<br>
The distributor 113 for liquid absorbent fluid is provided in<br>
39 of ~he generator 35 via a liquid absorbent fluid supply-conduit 12 3 .<br>
The distributor 1]3 comprises an end-piece 12 5 for connection to the conduit 123, located at the edge opposite the end-piece 77 on the cover 55 and conduits 127 for passage of liquid absorbent fluid connecting the end-piece 125 to an upstream upper edge of each plate 111.<br>
The collector 115 comprises, for each plate 111, a receptacle 129 foi collecting liquid mixed fluid and an end-piece 130 for discharge of mixed fluid common to all the receptacles 129.<br>
Each receptacle 129 has a structure which is similar to the receptacles 81 of the collector 65 for liquid cooling fluid. The receptacles 129 are thus fixed below the base wall 57 and have an opening for passage of the plate 111.<br>
The receptacles 81 for liquid cooling fluid and the receptacles 129 for liquid mixed fluid are spaced apart<br>
moving transversely along a horizontal axis perpendicular relative to the plates 111 and 61, from left to right in Figures 2 and 3.<br>
In the embodiment of F: ..jure 2, the collector 115 for absorbent fluid and the collector 65 for cooling fl.id are integral.<br>
 <br>
discharge of mixed fluid.<br>
The end-piece 13 0 for discharge of mixed fluid protrudes in a downward direction from una right-hand edge of the casing 43 in Figure 4, opposite the end-piece for discharge of cooling fluid S3. The end-piece 130 delimits an outlet 135 for discharge of mixed fluid.<br>
The downward inclinations of the respective base walls 85 and 131 of the receptacles 81 for liquid cooling fluid and the receptacles 129 for mixed fluid are directed in opposing directions in order to guide the liquid cooling fluid and the mixed fluid, towards the end-pieces 83, 130, respectively.<br>
The collector 115 is connected to the chamber 39 of the generator 33 via a conduit 137 for recirculation of mixed fluid which is connected to the end-piece 130.<br>
The means 117 for preventing the backflow of mixed fluid comprise, for each plate 111, a covering liner 138 which has a similar structure to the partition liner 91 of the plates 61. The liners 138 will therefore not be described in detail.<br>
Each liner 138 comprises two walls 139 for covering the respective surfaces 119A, 119B which have horizontal openings in order to form a so-called "open" "clere-story" structure. The walls 139 delimic on each surface 139A, 139B, ^overed regions 141 and uncovered regions 143 which extend horizontally.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Furthermore, a downstream uncovered region 113A extends in an upward direction on each surface 119A, 1133 from the base wall 57 co a first covered region 141A.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 5, through-holes 145 which are flush with the base wall 57 are provided in the lateral edges of the fins 147 which cover the downstream uncovered region 143A<br>
In this manner, the liquid collected on the base wall 57 of the space 53 may be discharged through the openings 145 towards the mixed fluid collector 115.<br>
Preferably, according to the invention, each wall 139A, 139B comprises a structure which is open in "clere-story" only over the f '.rst uncovered dovmstream region 143A which is used tc guide towards th:- plate 11] any drops present on the surfaces 119A and 119B, respectively. Each wall 139A, 139B preferably comprises, over the remainder of the surface thereof, a mesh of polymer, for example, of the cell type, whose configuration and distribution is capable of strengthening the porous member of each plate 111 by providing an opening surface which is at least equal to 50% of each surface 119A, 119B. Only the downstream uncovered region 143 of each 'wall 139 is opposite the downstream covered region 103 of each wall 95, the uncovered region 105 of each wall 9J facing the mesh, for example, of the cell type, of each -wall 143.<br>
 <br>
i*ic.h reference to Figure 1, the cooling syszem  49 comprises a conduit IE 1 f-r circulation of a heat-exchange fluid, a pump 152 and a firsr heat:-exchanger 155 which are mounted in a downstream direction on one conduit 151.<br>
The conduit 151 comprises a region 157 for heat-exchange with each plate 51, this region being able to be formed "by vertical conduits which are arranged in the plates 61.<br>
In a variant, the circulation conduit 151 is formed by the conduit 88 for recirculation of liquid cooling fluid. In this instance, the liquid cooling fluid forms the heat-exchange fluid and the first exchanger 155 is mounted on the conduit<br>
88.<br>
The first heat-exchanger 155 is arranged at the outer side of the evaporator/absorber assembly 37, in a heat-exchange relationship with the climate-control assembly 17.<br>
The cooling system 51 comprises a conduit 159 for circulation of a cooling fluid, a pump 161 and a second heat-exchanger 163 which is mounted in a downstream direction on the conduit 159.<br>
The conduit 159 comprises a region 165 for heat-exchange with each plate _11 formed, for example, by conduits which are arranged vertically in the plates 111.<br>
In a variant, the conduit 159 is formed by an upstream portion of the mixed fluid discharge conduit 137. The cooling fluid is formed by a part of the mixed fluid which is<br>
 <br>
reintroduced into the absorber 4/ via a branch conduit which opens upstream of the end-piece 1~5 on the conduit 123.<br>
The second heat-exchanger 163 is mounted on the front face of the vehicle upstream cf the radiator.<br>
The operation of the cooling device 11 according to the invention, for the climate-control of the passenger space 15 of a motor vehicle will now be described.<br>
Initially, the generator 33 contains a quantity of mixed<br>
fluid sufficient to immerse the region 42 of the heating means 41.<br>
Under the effect of being heated by the region 42, the liquid mixed fluid is separated into a gaseous current of cooling fluid and a liquid absorbent i iuid. The gaseous current of cooling fluid is collected in the passage conduit 4'", then condensed in the condenser 3 5 in order to form a current of liquid cooling fluid. This current is introduced into the evaporator 45 via the cooling fluid supply conduit 75. The liquid cooling fluid is thus introduced into the supply inlet 79, then distributed between the different plates 61 through the distributor 63.<br>
The liquid cooling fluid wets the surfaces 73A, 73B from the upstream upper edge 69  to the downstream lower edge 71. The presence cf the partition liner 91 allows the liquid cooling fluid to be contained in the plate 61 even if variations of flow rate and/or inclination of the assembly 37 occur, when the vehicle is moving.<br>
 <br>
Part of the liquid cooling fluid evaporates on the uncovered regions rS tf the surfaces 7 3,A, 73E which produces frigcries v;hich are collected by ^eans of heat exchange with die hesz-exchange fluid -~.hich is circulating in. the cooling system i? , These frigories are transmitted co the first heat-e&gt;;ch=.nger 155 by means of circulation of the heat-exchange fluid from the heat-exchange region 157.<br>
The liquid cooling fluid is collected in the receptacles 31 and flows towards the discharge end-piece 83, guided by the inclined slope of the base wall 85 of the receptacles 81.<br>
The presence of a porous pad 93, formed by the downstream region 89 of the plate 61 which is interposed in the receptacle 81 prevents liquid cooling fluid contained in the receptacle 81 from flowing back towards the space 53.<br>
Furthermore, the presence of a region 103A covered by the surface 7 3A which extends between the base wall 57 and a first opening 99A also limits the risk of liquid cooling fluid flowing back from the collector 65 into the space 53.<br>
At the same time, the current of liquid absorbent fluid is conveyed from the chamber 39 to the absorber 47 via the liquid coolant fluid supply conduit 123. This current is introduced via the end-piece 125 and is distributed between the various plates 111 by the distributor 113. The current of liquid absorbent fluid flows from the upper edge of the plates 111 towards the lower edge of tnese plates 111.<br>
The presence of the cohering liner 138 around the plates 111 contains the absorbent fluid in the plates 111 as it flows from the upper edge of each plate 111 towards the lower edge.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The liquid mixed fluid is therefore formed in the plates ill and collected in the mixed fluid collectors 129, then discharged towards the discharge end-piece 130 for mixed fluid, being guided by the downward inclination of the base walls 131 opposite the discharge end-piece 83 for cooling fluid. The liquid mixed fluid flowing in the plates 111 is cooled by circulating the heat-exchange fluid in the heat-exchange region 165 of the cooling system 51.<br>
The mixed fluid recovered in the receptacle 129 is reirtroduced into the generator 33 via the conduit 137.<br>
The space between the receptacles 81 tor cooling fluid which have a relatively low temperature and the receptacles 129 :or mixed fluid which have a relatively high temperature, mutually insulates these receptacles thermally.<br>
Furthermore, if a liquid is present in the base of the space 53, this liquid is discharged into the receptacles 129 of the mixed fluid collector 115 through the through-openings 147. The downstream wall 103A prevents this liquid from flowing into the collector 65 for liquid cc ling fluid.<br>
The risk of contamination of the liquid cooling fluid which flows in the transfer plates 61 is thus limited, even if the assembly 37 is subject to acceleration and/or is inclined during the movement of the motor vehicle.<br>
