In another embodiment, an article comprises the above-described polymer composition.<br>
The disclosure may be understood more readily by reference to the following detailed description of the various features of the disclosure and the examples included therein.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Disclosed herein are benzopyran compounds and methods for preparing these compounds. These compounds are useful as colorants in the preparation of colored polymers, especially in the preparation of thermoplastic colored polymers. The compounds are stable at high temperatures, and have good weatherability, and thus can be used in polymer compositions for forming a variety of articles.<br><br>
The singular forms "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. All ranges disclosed herein are inclusive of the recited endpoint and independently combinable (for example ranges of "up to 25 weight (wt.) percent, with 5 wt. percent to 20 wt. percent desired," is inclusive of the endpoints and all intermediate values of the ranges of "5 wt. percent to 25 wt. percent").<br>
The modifier "about" used in connection with a quantity is inclusive of the stated value and has the meaning dictated by the context (for example, includes the degree of error associated with measurement of the particular quantity).<br>
Compounds are described using standard nomenclature. For example, any position not substituted by any indicated group is understood to have its valency filled by a bond as indicated, or a hydrogen atom. A dash ("-") that is not between two letters or symbols is used to indicate a point of attachment for a substituent. For example, -CHO is attached through carbon of the carbonyl group.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the term "cycloaliphatic functionality" designates cyclic aliphatic functionalities having a valence of at least one, and comprising an array of atoms that is cyclic but that is not aromatic. The cycloaliphatic functionality may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. A "cycloaliphatic functionality" may be linked via the cyclic group or via another group on the cyclic group. For example, a cyclohexylmethyl group (C6H11CH2-) is a cycloaliphatic functionality which comprises a cyclohexyl ring (the array of atoms which is cyclic but which is not aromatic) and a methylene group (the noncyclic component). A "cycloaliphatic moiety" may further be unsubstituted or substituted, i.e., comprising one or more noncyclic components, including functional groups such as alkyl groups, alkenyl groups, alkynyl groups, haloalkyl groups, halogen(s), conjugated dienyl groups, alcohol groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups and nitro groups. For example, the 4-methylcyclopent-l-yl group is a C6 cycloaliphatic functionality comprising a methyl group, wherein the methyl group is a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 2-nitrocyclobut-l-yl group is a C4 cycloaliphatic<br><br>
functionality comprising a nitro group, wherein the nitro group is a functional group. Exemplary cycloaliphatic functionalities include cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, 1,1,4,4-tetramethylcyclobutyl, piperidinyl, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperydinyl, cyclohexyl, and cyclopentyl.<br>
As used herein, the term "aromatic functionality" refers to an array of atoms having a valence of at least one, and comprising at least one aromatic group. The array of atoms having a valence of at least one comprising at least one aromatic group may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, silicon and oxygen, or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. As used herein, the term "aromatic functionality" includes but is not limited to phenyl, pyridyl, furanyl, thienyl, naphthyl, phenylene, and biphenyl functionalities. The aromatic functionality may also include nonaromatic components. For example, a benzyl group is an aromatic functionality that comprises a phenyl ring (the aromatic group) and a methylene group (the nonaromatic component). Similarly a tetrahydronaphthyl functionality is an aromatic functionality comprising an aromatic group (C6H3) fused to a nonaromatic component -(CH2)4-. An "aromatic functionality" may further be unsubstituted or substituted with a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, haloalkyl groups, haloaromatic groups, halogens, alcohol groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups and nitro groups. For example, the 4-methylphenyl functionality is a C7 aromatic functionality comprising a methyl group, wherein the methyl group is a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 2-nitrophenyl group is a C&amp; aromatic functionality comprising a nitro group, wherein the nitro group is a functional group. Exemplary aromatic functionalities include, but are not limited to phenyl, 4-trifluoromethylphenyl, 4-chloromethylphen-1-yl, 3-trichloromethylphen-1 -yl (3-CCI3PI1-), 4-(3-bromoprop-l-yl)phen-l-yl (4-BrCH2CH2CH2Ph-),4-aminophen-1-yl (4-H2NPh-), 4-hydroxymethylphen-l-yl (4-HOCH2Ph-), 4-methylthiophen-l-yl (4-CH3SPI1-), 3-methoxyphen-l-yl, 2-nitromethylphen-l-yl (2-N02CH2Ph), and naphthyl.<br>
As used herein the term "aliphatic functionality" refers to an organic functionality having at least one carbon, a valence of at least one consisting of a linear or branched<br><br>
array of atoms that is not cyclic. The array of atoms comprising the aliphatic functionality may include heteroatoms such as nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, selenium and oxygen or may be composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen. An "aliphatic functionality" may be unsubstituted or substituted with a wide range of functional groups such as alkyl groups, haloalkyl groups, halogens, alcohol groups, ether groups, carboxylic acid groups, acyl groups (for example carboxylic acid derivatives such as esters and amides), amine groups and nitro groups. For example, the 4-methylpent-1 -yl is a C6 aliphatic functionality comprising a methyl group, wherein the methyl group is a functional group which is an alkyl group. Similarly, the 4-nitrobut-l-yl group is a C4 aliphatic functionality comprising a nitro group, wherein the nitro group is a functional group. Exemplary aliphatic functionalities include, but are not limited to methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, pentyl, isopentyl, trifluoromethyl, bromodifluoromethyl, chlorodifluoromethyl, chloromethyl, trichloromethyl, bromoethyl, 2-hexyl, hexamethylene, hydroxymethyl (i.e., -CH2OH), mercaptomethyl (-CH2SH), methylthio (-SCH3), methylthiomethyl (-CH2SCH3), methoxy, methoxycarbonyl (CH3OCO-), nitromethyl (-CH2NO2) and thiocarbonyl.<br>

In one embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) may be present in the polymer in an amount equal to about 1 part per billion (ppb). In an exemplary embodiment the amount is about 1 parts per million (ppm) to about 0.2 wt. percent. When used as a colorant, the concentration of the compound should be<br>
sufficient to allow a color change in the polymer and provide the required color value that would be detectable by the human eye. This implies that if the detector is the human eye, the emission is sufficient to be visually detectable.<br>
A method for making a colored polymer comprises combining a polymer and a composition comprising the compound of Formula (I), to provide a colored polymer. Mixtures of compounds of Formula (I) can be used. Other components in the composition comprising the compound of Formula (I) may be, for example, pigments, other colorants, other additives described below, and the like. As used herein, "combining" and a "combination" includes blends, alloys, mixtures, reaction products, and the like. In one specific embodiment the amount of compound of Formula (I) is about 1 part per million (ppm) to about 0.2 wt. percent of the weight of the polymer.<br>
In addition to the polymer and the compound of Formula (I), the polymer compositions disclosed herein may optionally include various additives ordinarily incorporated in resin compositions of this type. Such additives may include antioxidants, heat stabilizers, flame retardants, ultraviolet (UV) stabilizers, anti-static agents (tetra alkylammonium benzene sulfonate salts, tetra alkylphosphonium benzene sulfonate salts, and the like), mold releasing agents (pentaerythritol tetrastearate; glycerol monostearate, and the like). A combination comprising at least one of the foregoing can be used. For example, the polymer composition can comprise a heat stabilizer in an amount of about 0.01 weight percent to about 0.1 weight percent; an antistatic agent in an amount of about 0.01 weight percent to about 1 weight percent; and a mold releasing agent in an amount of about 0.1 weight percent to about 1 weight percent; each based upon the total weight of the polymer.<br>
Some possible antioxidants include, for example, organophosphites, e.g., tris(nonyl-phenyl)phosphite, tris(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)phosphite, bis(2,4-di-t-butylphenyl)pentaerythritol diphosphite, distearyl pentaerythritol diphosphite and the like; alkylated monophenols, polyphenols and alkylated reaction products of polyphenols with dienes, such as, for example, tetrakis[methylene(3,5-di-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate)]methane, 3,5-di-tertiary-butyl-4-<br>
hydroxyhydrocinnamate octadecyl, 2,4-di-tertiary-butylphenyl phosphite, and the like; butylated reaction products of para-cresol and dicyclopentadiene; alkylated hydroquinones; hydroxylated thiodiphenyl ethers; alkylidene-bisphenols; benzyl compounds; esters of beta-(3,5-di-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid with monohydric or polyhydric alcohols; esters of beta-(5-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxy-3-methylphenyl)-propionic acid with monohydric or polyhydric alcohols; esters of thioalkyl or thioaryl compounds, such as, for example, distearylthiopropionate, dilaurylthiopropionate, ditridecylthiodipropionate, and the like; amides of beta-(3,5-di-tertiary-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionic acid; and the like. A combination comprising at least one of the foregoing can be used.<br>
Other potential additives which may be employed comprise: stabilizers such as light and thermal stabilizers (e.g., acidic phosphorous-based compounds); hindered phenols; zinc oxide, zinc sulfide particles, or combination thereof; lubricants (mineral oil, and the like), plasticizers, colorants; among others, as well as a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing additives.<br>
In order to aid in the processing of the colored polymer, particularly when the polymer is polycarbonate, catalyst(s) may also be employed, namely in the extruder or other mixing device. The catalyst typically assists in controlling the viscosity of the resulting material. Possible catalysts include hydroxides, such as tetraalkylammonium hydroxide, tetraalkylphosphonium hydroxide, and the like, specifically diethyldimethylammonium hydroxide and tetrabutylphosphonium hydroxide. The catalyst(s) can be employed alone or in combination with quenchers such as acids, such as phosphoric acid, and the like. Additionally, water may be injected into the polymer melt during compounding and removed as water vapor through a vent to remove residual volatile compounds.<br>
The colored polymers disclosed herein are produced by using a reaction vessel capable of adequately mixing various precursors, such as a single or twin screw extruder, kneader, blender, or the like.<br>
Methods for incorporating the compound of Formula (I) and any other optional additives into the polymer include, for example, coating, admixing, blending, or copolymerisation. The compound of Formula (I) can be incorporated into the polymer such that it is uniformly dispersed throughout the polymer or such that it is dispersed in a portion of the polymer. In one exemplary embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) is uniformly dispersed throughout the polymer. The compound of Formula (I) can be incorporated into the polymer in the polymer manufacturing stage, during the polymer compounding step, during polymer processing into articles, or combinations thereof. In one embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) may be introduced using a concentrate (i.e., master-batch) either during the polymer compounding stage or during the article forming, alone or with other optional additives.<br>
For example, the polymer precursors for the polymer can be premixed with the compound of Formula (I) (e.g., in a pellet, powder, and/or liquid form) and simultaneously fed through a hopper into the extruder, or the compound of Formula (I) can be optionally added in the feed throat or through an alternate injection port of the injection molding machine or other molding. In one exemplary embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) may be homogenously distributed unless it is placed in a carrier that is not miscible with the polymer.<br>
In another embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) is incorporated into the polymer by admixing, blending, compounding, or copolymerisation. In one exemplary embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) is incorporated into the polymer by forming a dry blend of the compound of Formula (I) with the polymer and compounding the resultant mixture.<br>
In another embodiment, the compound of Formula (I) may be incorporated into the polymer by adding the compound of Formula (I) to the melt during compounding. Such additions may be made via a side feeder, for example. Alternatively, the compound of Formula (I) can be formulated with a small amount of the polymer (or another polymer), optionally with other additive(s) in the form of a concentrate and added to the polymer before or during processing of the polymer. In a specific<br>
embodiment, the polymer compositions are processed by compounding the polymer with any additive(s) using a twin-screw extruder, and adding the compound of Formula (I) in the form of a concentrate, optionally with other additives, to the melt via a side feeder.<br>
When the polymer precursors are employed, the extruder is maintained at a sufficiently high temperature to melt the polymer precursors without causing decomposition thereof. For polycarbonate, for example, temperatures of about 220°C to about 360°C may be used in one embodiment. In another embodiment temperatures of about 260°C to about 320°C may be utilized. Similarly, the residence time in the extruder is typically controlled to minimize decomposition. Residence times of up to about 2 minutes or more may be employed, with up to about 1.5 minutes used in one embodiment, and up to about 1 minute used in another exemplary embodiment. Prior to extrusion into the desired form (typically pellets, sheet, web, or the like), the resulting mixture can optionally be filtered, such as by melt filtering and/or the use of a screen pack, or the like, to remove undesirable contaminants or decomposition products.<br>
The colored polymer compositions may be used for any application in which the physical and chemical properties of the material are desired. In certain embodiments the colored polymers may be used in applications including packaging material (and especially drug packaging), automotive parts, telecommunication accessories (for example, cell phone covers), computers and consumer electronics, construction materials, medical devices, eyewear products, secure documents including passports and ID cards, credit cards, films and sheets (including those used in display applications), and the like. The colorants may also be used to make compositions for tagging and authenticating data storage media substrates that are currently unknown and/or unavailable to unauthorized manufacturers, sellers, and/or users of data storage media as they fluoresce at a particular wavelength when exposed to ultraviolet radiation.<br><br>
A further understanding of the techniques described above can be obtained by reference to certain specific examples that are provided herein for purposes of illustration only* and are not intended to be limiting.<br>

Weatherability Testing: The molded chips incorporating the benzopyran compound as colorant were subjected to a weatherability test by using an Atlas Ci4000 weatherometer following ASTM D4459 test method (for indoor applications). The D65 illuminator was used since it most closely simulates natural sunlight. After being exposed for about 300 hours, the color of the sample was analyzed in the transmittance mode using a Macbeth Color Eye 7000A instrument equipped with an integrating sphere. The results are shown in Table 3. Sample measurements were made at exposure times of zero (control sample; before being placed in the Weatherometer), 100, 200, and 300 hours of exposure. The various parameters shown in Table 3 are: L Lightness ; a*: redness-greenness, b*: yellowness-blueness; and C*: chroma; H*: hue; DL*: difference in lightness before and after exposure in weatherometer; Da*, Db*, and DC* represent the difference in difference in values for the a*, b*, and C*, respectively, before and after the exposure in weatherometer; DH*: difference in hue before and after exposure in weatherometer; and DE*, which represents the total color difference between the values obtained from before and after<br>
exposure in the weatherometer. DE* is derived from the Da*, Db*, and AL* values, as shown in equation (1):<br>
(Equation 1Removed)<br>
A negative DL indicates a darker sample relative to a control sample, while a positive DL indicates a relatively lighter sample. A negative Da* indicates a sample which is less red than the reference sample, while a positive Da* indicates that the sample is relatively more red. A negative Db* indicates a sample which is less yellow than the reference sample, while a positive Da* indicates that the sample is relatively more yellow. DC* is related to Da* and Db* by equation (2):<br>

The above results show that the colorants prepared as per Example 1 can be incorporated into polycarbonate as per Example 2. The colored polycarbonate so obtained provides good color value and also shows good weatherability properties as indicated in Table 3.<br>
9,10,10-Trioxo-9,10-dihydro-l 016-thioxanthene-3-carboxylic acid (6-cyano-9-diethylamino-7-oxa-4b,13-diaza-indeno[2,l-a]anthracen-5-ylidene)-amide (Formula (I)) as prepared above in Example 1 was incorporated in polycarbonate by compounding polycarbonate powder using twin screw extruder and molded articles of 2.54 mm thickness obtained after subjecting pellets to molding using L&amp; T Demag 60 molding machine. Molded plaques showed intense red fluorescence (Emission in Red region-590-610 nm) when exposed to 365 nm (long wavelength) UV irradiation with bright red edge glow effect. This indicates that the benzopyran colorants may also be used as fluorescent tags.<br>
