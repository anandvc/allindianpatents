COLLECTING APPARATUS FOR AN OIL COLLECTOR FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a collecting apparatus for an oil collector that is applicable to be secured to a collecting apparatus floating on water in order to improve the collecting efficiency of the collecting apparatus.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART	<br>
Previously there are known float-supported collecting devices that float, and they have a problem that large amounts of water are collected with oil. At their simplest, said collecting devices consist of an oil trans- fer pump provided with a funnel that opens upwardly and whose collecting inlet is located below the surface of water. The collecting inlet is to be located as close to the surface of water as possible. Nevertheless, the open collecting inlet of the funnel below the surface of water contributes to the fact that as the waves get higher the amount of oil collected is very small in proportion to the amount of water. Attempts have been made to provide these collecting devices with additional structures afterwards, but with little success.<br>
Previously there is also known, for instance, from US patent 4,021, 344 a floating oil pick up device supported on floats, in which device oil is lifted from water with rotatable discs for recovery. However, complexity is a drawback of this known solution. To rotate the discs requires that teeth be pro- vided on the edge of each disc. Teeth machined in a worm ring to be rotated horizontally engage with the teeth in the discs such that the discs will have a desired rotating motion. This structure sets high requirements for the production material of the discs nd the worm ring. Moreover, there is a risk that any one of the teeth will be blocked by debris floating amid the oil, whereby the whole apparatus may stop immediately.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to solve the above- described problem and to provide a collecting apparatus, whose structure is simpler than before and operation is more reliable, and which can be mounted, for instance, on the existing collectors. This is achieved with a collecting apparatus according to the attached independent claim 1.<br>
The solution of the invention is based on the idea that when a centre part of a collecting member is made of flexible material, which is shaped into a ring-shaped, endless axis, a construction is provided that is very simple and reliable in operation in connection with oil collecting. Thus bristled rings of the collecting member can be formed of bristles to be secured directly to the centre part of the collecting member, and alternatively, when collecting plates are used the collecting plates can be secured directly to the centre part of the collecting member. The bristles and the plates rotate thus directly with the centre part of the collecting member, and their rotation does not require any teeth, which could get blocked by the effect of debris in the oil. In the invention it is easy to encase the parts (such as teeth) required for rotating the centre part of the collecting member, because they need very little space.<br>
Using a ring-shaped collecting member makes it possible to achieve an advantage that oil recovery may take place from all sides of the collecting apparatus, whereby the recovery is efficient. Mounting the collecting apparatus of the invention on a known funnel-shaped oil collector increases the operating efficiency of the apparatus considerably, because clearly more oil and less water can be collected.<br>
In accordance with the invention the centre part may consist of one piece. Alternatively, it may consist of a plurality of pieces, the ends of which are interconnected, or the ends of which are interconnectedthrough a motor or motors rotating the centre part. Between the motor and the centre part it is also possible to utilize a reduction gear so as to achieve a suitable rotation rate.<br>
The preferred embodiments of the collecting apparatus according to the invention are disclosed in the attached dependent claims 2 to 6.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
In the following the invention will be described, by way of example, in greater detail with reference to the<br><br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1a illustrates how a collecting apparatus according to the invention is secured to oil collecting device and Figure 1B shows the collecting apparatus mounted on the oil-collecting device.<br>
In Figures 1a and 1b the collecting apparatus of the invention is arranged in a frame 1, which is applicable to be mounted on a funnel 8 of a known floating oil collector. In Figure 1A, a motor or motors 4 and a collecting member 5 are secured to the frame 1 in a mounting base 2 surrounding a central opening 6. Floats 10, an oil transfer pump 9, an oil transfer hose 12 and an oil-receiving container 11 are secured to the funnel 8.<br>
In Figure 1B the frame 1 and the relating parts are secured to the funnel through the mounting base 2. In Figure 1B the apparatus floats on water such that the collecting member 5 is located at the waterline VL.<br>
The invention utilizes the frame 1 that is surrounded by a flexible centre part of the collecting member 5, the longitudinal centre of the centre part being dimensioned to the frame 1 such that the centre part of the collecting member 5 rotates at a predetermined distance from the frame. Thus the centre part acts as a flexible axis. A U-shaped border that surrounds the central opening 6 of the frame in the collecting apparatus is part of the mount¬ing base 2 of the frame 1, to which the funnel 8, the oil transfer pump or the like is connected. In this connection the U-shaped structure denotes that the outer border of the frame 1 is shaped into a groove that opens outwardly in the horizontal direction, allowing the collecting member to be placed in this groove.<br>
The U-shaped structure of the frame should be such that it matches with the collecting member 5 surrounding the centre part and that the funnel 8 secured to the oil transfer pump 9 matches with the mounting base 2.<br>
The frame 1 also includes one or more points, on which the centre part of the collecting member 5 is mounted with bearings, as well as motors 4 and a cleanerfor cleaning the collecting member. The function of the funnel 8 se-cured to the oil transfer pump 9 is to balance the reception of collected oils. In some cases the funnel can be omitted from the structure completely, and then the floats 10 and devices secured to the frame of the collecting apparatus will be secured directly to the oil transfer pump.<br>
By arranging the collecting member 5 around the circular frame 1 it is possible to achieve large collecting capacity with respect to the size of the device. The centre part of the collecting member 5 must be made of strong material, for instance metal-reinforced rubber or a similar flexible material. Thanks to the strong, flexible structure of the centre part it is possible to use a brush as the collecting member, the brush being suited for collecting lighter oils. Even though brush technology is the dominating collecting method, it is possible to use discs as the collecting member, if so desired.<br>
The oil collecting apparatus of Figure 1 b can be connected to a boat, for instance, from which the energy required for driving the collecting member and for operating the oil transfer pump 9 can be transmitted. Alterna¬tively, it can be an independent apparatus that is equipped with necessary sources of power so as to enable driving and pumping.<br>
Figure 2a shows a partial cross-section of a first preferred embodiment of the collecting apparatus and Figure 2b shows a top view of the first preferred embodiment.<br>
Figure 2a is a side view in partial cross section of the collect- ing apparatus, in which the centre part 3 of the collecting member 5 surround- ing the frame 1 that is part of the mounting base 2 is secured to a motor 4 with a clamp 13. Bearings 7 also appear in Figure 2a. Thus, the collecting member 5 has an elongated centre part 3<br><br>
having a central axis and being formed into a ring-shaped, endless axis. This endless axis is driven by the motor 4 for lifting oil from water with the collecting member 5.<br>
Figure 2b is a top view of the collecting apparatus, which includes the collecting member 5 surrounding the frame 1 that is part of the mounting base 2 and the motor 4 installed in the longitudinal direction and se- cured with the clamp 13 to the centre part 3 rotating on bearings 7. The motor placed in the frame in the longitudinal direction of the centre part 3 can operate, for instance, with a bidirectional axis, to which the ends of the centre parts are secured with clamps or the like. The motor installed in the longitudinal direction of the centre part makes the collecting member shorter and thus reduces collecting capacity, but technically it is not so liable to damage as a motor operating transversely.<br>
Figure 3a shows a second preferred embodiment of the collecting apparatus in partial cross section and Figure 3b shows a top view of the second preferred embodiment. These figures show a side view how the centre part 3 is mounted with bearings 7 on the frame 1. In this embodiment the motors 4 are installed transversely.<br>
Figure 4a shows a first preferred securing method of the motor. The figure shows a side view of a support 16 and a cross-sectional view of a bearing 7 secured to the mounting base 2 in the frame 1 and the transversely installed motor 4. The centre part appears cut in the figure. A cogwheel 14 is connected to the centre part, by means of which cogwheel the rotary motion of the motor can be transmitted to the centre part 3. The zone in the centre part, to which the cogwheel is secured, can be encased in accordance with the in- vention so as to prevent the debris in the oil from entering the COGWHEEL to block the operation thereof.<br>
Figure 4b shows a second preferred securing method of the motor. The figure is a top view of part of the mounting base 2 and a cross-sectional view of the frame 1, to which are secured the motor 4 and the bearing 7, to which a COGWHEEL 14 secured to the centre part 3 is placed. In Figure 4b the motor is installed transversely to the centre part 3. Thus, it is possible to utilize wheels placed inside the bearings.<br>
Figures 5a and 5b illustrate the structure of a cleaner of the collecting apparatus. Figure 5a shows a cleaner, which is supported by a sup- port 16 secured to the frame 1 and with which oil is removed from the collecting member 5, and the bearings 7. Figure 5b shows a cross section of the frame 1 and the cleaner 15, which is mounted on the support 16 and with which the collecting member 5 is cleaned. As it appears from Figure 5b, the groove formed by the frame exterior cooperates with the collecting member 5 provided with bristles. As the oil carried into the groove by the collecting member comes into contact with the groove, it is pressed deep in the bristles of the collecting member, whereby the oil will be lifted as efficiently as possible to the cleaner with the collecting member 5.<br>
If the collecting member 5 is a brush or a frame, for instance, it is possible to use a previously known toothed, saw-like blade or disc-based methods for cleaning. The cleaner 15 is secured to the collecting apparatus, for instance, by attaching it with bolts to the support 16 in the frame 1. Despite of the curvature, the tips of the cleaner 15 follow the curvature of the centre part 3 such that the brushes of the collecting member 5 will always remain between the tips. The operation takes place such that the motor 4 installed in the frame 1 starts rotating the centre part 3 supported on the bearings 7, to which centre part the collecting member is mounted or secured. Oil adhering to the collecting member 5 that floats on the surface of water by means of floats is removed with the cleaner, whereby the oil flows through the central opening 6 into the funnel 8 or directly into the oil transfer pump, from which the oil is pumped into a boat or into an oil collecting tank arranged in the corresponding manner.<br>
Figures 6a to 6c show structural details of the bearings and the frame. Figure 6a shows a bearing 7 mounted on the frame 1, the centre part 3 surrounded by a slide ring 18, a predetermined distance 21 between the centre 17 of the centre part and the frame 1, and the collecting member 5 attached to the centre part. The centre part of the collecting member 5 can be provided with slide rings 18 at one or more points, the function of the slide rings being to prevent the centre part 3 from moving in the longitudinal direction and to enhance the rotation of the centre part 3. The bearings 7 required by the slide rings 18 can be secured to the frame by bolts at desired intervals and they should be ready to open forchanging the collecting member. For in-stance nylon can be used as material for the slide rings and the bearings to make them lighter and more resistant to salty seawater.<br>
Figure 6a illustrates mutually alternative collecting member structures, i. e. the collecting member can be<br><br><br>
provided with oil collecting plates, bristles or brush rings, for instance.<br>
Figure 6b shows a cross-sectional side view of the bolted 19 attachment of the frame 1 associated with mounting base 2 as well as the bearings 7 and a bearing groove 20.<br>
Figure 6c shows the frame 1 associated with the mounting base 2 and secured with the bolt 19, the bearings from above and the bearing groove 20.<br>
Figure 7a shows the collecting apparatus in operation. The figure shows the support 16 secured to the frame 1, the cleaner 15 and the collecting member 5 in operation, whereby the collected oil drains through the central opening 6 into the funnel 8, wherefrom the oil is transferred by the action of the oil transfer pump 9 via the oil transfer hose into the oil receiving container 11.<br>
It should be understood that the above description and the relating figures are only intended to illustrate the present invention. It will be apparent to the person skilled in the art that the invention can be varied and modified in a variety ways without deviating from the scope of the invention defined in the attached claims.<br><br>
