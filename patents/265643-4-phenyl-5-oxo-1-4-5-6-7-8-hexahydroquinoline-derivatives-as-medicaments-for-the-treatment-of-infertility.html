				<td>The actions of the FSH honnone are mediated by a specific plasma membrane receptor that is a member of the large family of G-protein co\q)led receptors. These receptors consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and are able to interact with the Gs protein, leading to the activation of adenylate cyclase.<br>
The FSH receptor is a highly specific target in the ovarian follicle growth process and is exclusively expressed in the ovary. Blocking of the receptor or inhibiting the signalling which is nomially induced after FSH-mediated receptor activation will disturb follicle development and thus ovulation and fertility. Low molecular weight FSH antagonists could form the basis for new contraceptives, while low molecular weight FSH agonists can be used for the same clinical purposes as native FSH, i.e. for the treatment of infertility and for ovarian hyperstimulation on behalf of in vitro fertilisation.<br>
Low molecular weight FSH mimetics with agonistic properties were disclosed in the International Application WO 2000/08015 (Applied Research Systems ARS Holding N.V.) and m WO 2002/09706 (Affymax Research Institute).<br>
Certain tetrahydroquinoline derivatives have recently been disclosed in the International Application WO 2003/004028 (AKZO NOBEL N.V.) as FSH modulating substances, either having agonistic or antagonistic properties.<br>
There remains a need for low molecular weight hormone mimetics that selectively activate the FSH receptor.<br>
To that aim the present invention provides 2-methyl-4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of general formula I<br><br><br>

The 2-methyl-4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives according to the present invention are potent FSH receptor activators and can be used for the same clinical purposes as native FSH since they behave like agonists, with the advantage that they may be prepared synthetically, may display altered stability properties and may be administered differently.<br>
Thus, the FSH-receptor agonists of the present invention may be used for the treatment of fertility disorders e.g. controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF procedures.<br><br>

R% R% R^ R'", X and Z are as previously defined and Y is an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or alkoxyalkyl group. Alternatively, compounds of general formula EX-h can be converted to the corresponding acid chlorides IX-i by art known methods: Treatment of carboxylic acids of general formula IX-h with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride and DMF in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane or toluene gives the corresponding acid chlorides EX-i. Subsequent reaction with amines of general structure R^^*^NH, optionally in tiie presence of a suitable tertiary amine base, yields compounds of general formula I-i.<br>

Compounds of general formula I-d can be JV-acylated to give compounds of general<br><br>
Y Is an alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or alkoxyalkyl group<br><br>
fonnula I-j, wherein R\ R^, R^, R^\ X and Z are as previously defined. These acylations can be achieved using the same synthetic procedures that were described for the prepaxation of derivatives I-g fiom conpounds DC-f<br>
Similar to the iV-sulfonylation reactions of derivatives IX-f to give compounds I-h, conpounds I-d can be sulfonylated to give compounds I-k, wherein R\ R^, R^, R", X and Z are as previously defined.<br><br>
Compounds of general fonnula I-l, wherein R\ R^, R^, R^ and Z are as previously defined, can be reductively alkylated with simple aldehydes or ketones (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, acetone or butan-2-one)3 using the same methodology as described for the preparation of compoimds I-b fix)m V-b, to give coii5)oimds of general fonnula I-m, wherein R\ R^, R^, R"* and Z are as previously defined.<br><br>
The substituted cyclohexane-l,3-diones of general formula n are commercially available or can be prepared by literature procedures. Relevant examples are found in: J. Med Chem. 43 (2000) 4678-4693, Tetrahedron 56 (2000) 4753-4758, J. Med. Chem. 35 (1992) 3429-3447, ibid, 24 (1981) 1026-1034, Org. Synt Coll. Vol. V (1973) 400, Chem. Ber. 88 (1955) 316-327, Justus Liebig Ann. Chem. 570 (1950) 15-31.<br><br>
The compound of formula m-a is commercially available and compoxmd Ul-b has been documented in literature, see for example: Drug Dev. Res. 51 (2000) 225-232.<br>
Benzaldehydes of general formula IV-a, wherein R, R and R are as previously defined and X = O, are readily prepared from benzaldehydes of general formula X-a using the same methods as described for the conversion of con:^unds of formula V-a to I-a. Likewise, compounds of general fomiula IV-b, wherein R^, R^ and R^ are as previously defined and X = N-R^, are prepared firom derivatives X-b using the same methods as described for the conversion of connpounds of formula V-b to derivatives I-b.<br><br>
The 1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of general formula V can be prepared by the aforementioned Hantzsch-type cyclocondensation reaction between cyclohexanediones 11, enamines IE and aldehydes X.<br><br>
Compounds of general formula V-d-e in which R^ is Br can also be obtained by ortho-<br><br><br>
broiniiiatioii of phenols or anilines, which are well known to those sHlled in the art. Thus, compounds of formula V-f-g — synthesized from compounds n and HI and aldehydes XI by a Hantzsch-type cyclocondensation reaction — afford corq)ounds of formula V-d-e upon treatment with bromine in a suitable solvent such as acetic acid, ethanol or dichloromethane or mixtures thereof, optionally in the presence of sodium acetate. Alternatively, JV-bromosuccinimide in i^,^-dimethylformamide or acetonitrile can be used to achieve this conversion. For example, see: J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans.2 6 (2000) 1113-1118, J. Org.

Alternatively, alkylation of derivatives of general formula V with reagents Xni-XV — which are documented in literature, commercially available or readily prepared — can also provide derivatives IX by the same methods used for the preparation of compounds I-a-b from V-a-b, as described previously.<br>
Benzaldehydes of general formula X and XI are commercially available or can be prepared according to hterature procedures: J. Chem. Soc, Perkia Trans, 2 (2000) 1119-1124, J. Chem. Soc, Chem. Commun, 4 (1993) 419-420, Synlh. Commun. 20 (1990) 2659-2666, Chem. Pharm, Bull. 34 (1986) 121-129, Indian J. Chem. Sect. B 20 (1981) 1010-1013, Monatsh. Chem. 106 (1975) 1191-1201, DE 1070162, J.

Con5)Ounds of general formula XVI can be obtained by the reduction of the nitro group in compounds of general formula XVn to the corresponding amino group. Typically, conipounds XVn are treated with zinc and acetic acid in a suitable solvent such as THF or dioxane at temperatures between 0 °C and reflux temperature. Alternative methods include treatment with iron, SnCU, or hydrogen in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such paUadiimi or platinum on charcoal, using methods and reagents well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
Benzaldehydes of general foimula X-d wherein R^ is as previously defined R^ is an amdnosulfonyl group and X is O can be obtained by chlorosulfonylation of con5)ounds of general formula XI-c followed by reaction with amines of general formula R^R^NH using the same procedures described for the synthesis of compounds of general formula V-j from V-h via V-i. The hydroxyl group of compounds X-d can be triflated by art known methods to give compounds XVIII, which can undergo nucleophilic aromatic substitution with ammonia to yield benzaldehydes X-e. For related aromatic substitution reactions see: J. Med Chem. 6 (1963) 272-275, Indian J. Chem. Sect. B 18 (1979), 88-90. Additionally, derivatives X-d can be converted to conpounds of formula XEX, wherein PG is H or an optional protective group such as 4-nitrobenzyl or 2,5-dimethoxyben2yl, followed by art known Smiles rearrangement to give products of general formula X-e, after deprotection (if necessary). For examples of this type of rearrangement reactions, see: J. Org. Chem. 48 (1983) 5140-5143, Tetrahedron Lett. 30 (1989) 931-934, Tetrahedron 53 (1997) 11919-11928, Synth.

conversion of derivatives X-d to X-e, using appropriately substituted amines of general formula H2N-Y-FG in the reaction sequence.<br><br>
The compounds of the present mvention possess at least two chiral carbon atoms and may therefore be obtained as pure enantiomers, or as a mixture of enantiomers, or as a mixture of diastereomers. Methods for obtaining the pure enantiomers are well known in the art, e.g. crystallization of salts which are obtained from optically active acids and the racemic mixture, or chromatography using chiral columns. For separation of diastereomers, straight phase or reversed phase colxnnns may be used.<br>
The compounds of the invention may form hydrates or solvates. It is known to those of skill in the art that charged compounds form hydrated species when lyophilized with water, or form solvated species when concentrated in a solution with an qypropriate organic solvent. The compounds of this invention include the hydrates or solvates of the coii5)Oimds listed.<br>
The 2-methyl-4-phenyl-5-oxo-l,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivatives of the invention were found to be agonists of the FSH receptor. Methods to determine receptor binding, as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity, of gonadotropins are well known. In general, e5q)ressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and binding or stimulation or inhibition of a ftmctional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response, isolated DNA encoding the FSH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in suitable host cells. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the cells are of mammalian origin (Jia et al, MoLEndocrin., 5:759-776,1991).<br>
Methods to construct recombinant FSH expressing cell lines are well known in the art (Sambrook et al.. Molecular Cloning; a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor<br><br>
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Eqxression of receptor is attained by expression of the DNA encoding the desired protein. Techniques for site directed noiutagenesis, ligation of additional sequences, PCR, and construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions, or all, of the DNA encoding the desired protein can be constructed synthetically using standard soHd phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided to the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, insect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells e3q)ressing the receptor are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively, isolated cell membranes containing the e3q)ressed receptor may be used to measure binding of compound.<br>
For measurement of binding, radioactive or fluorescent compounds may be used. As reference compound human recombinant FSH can be used.<br>
In the alternative also competition binding assays may be perfomied.<br>
Another assay involves screening for FSH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of recqrtor mediated cAMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expression of the receptor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test con5)ound. The amount of cAMP is then measured. The level of cAMP will be increased, by tiie stimulating effect of the test compound upon binding to the receptor.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells lines can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which responds to the level of cAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or might be constmcted in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles<br><br>
of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Stratowa, C, Hmunler, A. and CzemiloMy, A., (1995) Curr. Opin. BiotechnoL 6:574.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a 2-methyl-4"phenyl-5-oxo-l,455,637,8-hexahydroquinoline derivative or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof having the general formula I in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries and optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being conipatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterioxis to the recipients thereof.<br>
Compositions include e.g. those suitable for oral, sublingual, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, nasal, local, or rectal administration, and the like, all in unit dosage forms for administration.<br>
For oral administration, the active ingredient may be presented as discrete units, such as tablets, capsules, powders, granulates, solutions, suspensions, and the like.<br>
For parenteral administration, the pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be presented in unit-dose or mufti-dose containers, e.g. injection liquids in predetermined amounts, for example in sealed vials and ampoules, and may also be stored in a freeze dried (lyophilized) condition requiring only the addition of sterile liquid carrier, e.g. water, prior to use.<br>
Mixed with such pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, e.g. as described in the standard reference, Gennaro, AJL et al., Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy (20th Edition., Lippincott Williams &amp; WiUdns, 2000, see especially Part 5: Pharmaceutical Manufecturing), the active agent may be compressed into solid dosage units, such as pills, tablets, or be processed into capsules or suppositories. By means of pharmaceutically acceptable liquids the active agent can be applied as a fluid composition, e.g. as an injection preparation, in the form of a solution, suspension, emulsion, or as a spray, e.g. a nasal spray.<br>
For making solid dosage units, the use of conventional additives such as fillers, colorants, polymeric binders and the like is contemplated. In general any pharmaceutically acceptable additive which does not interfere with the function of the active conipounds can be used. Suitable carriers with which the active agent of the invention can be administered as soUd compositions include lactose, starch, cellulose derivatives<br><br>
and the like, or mixtures thereof, used in suitable amouBts. For parenteral administration, aqueous suspensions, isotonic saline solutions and sterile injectable solutions may be used, containing pharmaceutically acceptable dispersing agents and/or wetting agents, such as propylene glycol or butylene glycol.<br>
The invention further includes a pharmaceutical coniposition, as hereinbefore described, in combination with packaging material suitable for said composition, said packaging material including instructions for the use of the composition for the use as hereinbefore described<br>
The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical conposition thereof, may vary with the particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon absorption. However, a suitable dosage for humans may be 0.05-25 mg per kg body weight. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at appropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as weU as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient<br>
Thus, the con^pounds according to the invention can be used in therapy.<br>
A further aspect of the invention resides in the use of a 2-methyl-4-phenyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivative having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament to be used fcff the treatment of disorders responsive to FSH receptor mediated pathways, preferably for the treatment of fertility disorders. Thus, patients in need thereof can be administered with suitable amounts of the conpounds according to the invention.<br>
In yet another aspect the invention resides in the use of a 2-methyl-4-phenyl-5-oxo-1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline derivative having the general formula I for the manufecture of a medicament to be used for the treatment of infertility.<br><br>
The invention is illustrated by the following examples.<br>

A/B/C =15/80/5 (v/v/v).<br>
The diastereomeric ratio (Diast. ratio) was determined if baseline separation of the individual diastereomers was observed using the appropriate analytical HPLC method. Alternatively, the diastereomeric ratio was determined by ^H NMR analysis when distinct signals corresponding to the diastereomers were identified. The reported diastereomeric ratios relate to the configurations of C-4 and C-7 of the 1,4,5,6,7,8-hexahydroquinoline core.<br>

Agonistic activitv of compounds at the human FSH receptor expressed in CHO cells<br>
Agonist activity of the compounds at the hxmian FSH receptor was tested in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with the human FSH receptor and cotransfected with a cAMP re^onsive element (CRE) / promoter directing the e3q)ression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Binding of the compound to the Gs-coupled FSH receptor wiU result in an increase of cAMP, which in turn will induce an increased transactivation of the luciferase reporter construct. The luciferase activity was quantified using a luminescence counter. The compounds were tested in the concentration range of 0.1 nM to 10 |iM. This assay was used to determine the EC50 (concentration of test compound causing half-maximal (50 %) luciferase stimulation) and efficacy of the compounds compared to recombinant human FSH. For this, the software program XL^ (Excel version 2,0, built 30, ID Business Solutions Limited) was used<br>
