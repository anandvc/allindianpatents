TRANSGENIC FIBER PRODUCING PLANTS WITH INCREASED EXPRESSION OF SUCROSE PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for increasing the yield or quality of product from a plant by altering the expression of sucrose phosphate synthase. In particular, the present invention provides a transgenic cotton plant that has an increased level of sucrose phosphate synthetase relative to a non-transgenic cotton plant. Methods are also provided for increasing the yield or the quality of cotton fiber and the yield of cotton seed produced from a cotton plant. General methods are provided for regulating the thickness of cell walls, for increasing the yield and quality of other plant fibers, for regulating the ratio of cellulose to other dry weight components of the plant, for increasing seed yield, and for increasing tolerance of photo synthetic efficiency to cool night temperatures.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The control of high-rate cellulose production and its regulation by temperature are criiical to agriculture, since all plant growth (and hence the production of all food crops) depends on cellulose synthesis to build cell walls throughout the vegetative and reproductive parts of the plant. The cellulose within the primary walls of all cells of the plant body is also of direct industrial importance as a digestible pan of animal forage and for manufacture of thickeners, ethanol. and other cellulose-based or cellulose-derived products. Furthermore, plant pans based on secondary cell walls with high cellulose content are contained in or compose economically important plant pro'ducts. including cotton fibers, wood, and fibers in forage crops. The agronomic productivity and product quality of wood and cotton, as well as other fiber crops such as hemp and flax, are in large part determined by the biosynthesis of cellulose. Therefore, an understanding of the basic regulatory mechanisms of cellulose synthesis and how it responds to temperature stress allows for beneficial changes in crop plants (improved product yield and quality) through genetic engineering.<br>
Since cotton fiber weight is more than 90% cellulose, cotton is one particular crop where enhancing the flow of carbon to cellulose production can increase yield and<br><br>
quality. This will be an especially beneficial outcome if it is achievable under diverse environmental conditions encountered in cotton production fields, including cool night temperatures that hinder cotton fiber development. For example, it is known that cool night temperatures hinder the seasonal yield and quality of cotton fiber (Gipson. 'Temperature Effects on Growth, Development, and Fiber Properties^ in Mauney, eds.. Cotton Phvsiologw The Cotton Foundation:Memphis, pp. 47-56) because they hinder the rate of cellulose synthesis (Roberts et aL "Effects of Cycling Temperatures on Fiber Metabolism in Cultured Cotton Ovules." Plant Physiol.. 100:979-986 (1992)). The ability to manipulate cotton yield and fiber quality parameters and sustain or improve them under diverse and/or stressful environmental conditions will allow for beneficial changes in crop plants (improved product quality) through genetic engineering.<br>
Cotton fiber yield is the most important determinant of the value of the crop to the producer. Reputable cotton breeders have recently pointed out that cotton production has reached a fiber yield plateau, which bodes ill for the financial success of producers given escalating costs. Potential contributors to this problem include the environmental sensitivity of cotton fiber and seed development, the narrow genetic base of commercial cotton, and the recent introduction of transgenic traits such as herbicide and insect resistance through back-crossing with transformed Gossypium hirsutum cv. Coker 312. Coker 312 (C312) is an old cultivar frequently used for transformation because of its high regeneration capacity. Use of genetic engineering to make cotton crop production more stress resistant, to expand the genetic potential of cultivated cotton, and to improve the yield of transformed cotton with diverse novel traits will bring needed increases in crop vield.<br>
Similarly, seed yield is of value to the cotton producer since seeds are sold for oil production and animal feed. Another minor component, the short fuzz fibers on each seed, provides added economic value to the seed crop. Increased seed and fuzz fiber yield without sacrifice of lint fiber yield or quality would help the producer recover more profit per acre of cotton production. As for cotton seed, increased yield of any seed crop will be of major benefit to agriculture.<br>
Improved cotton fiber quality parameters such as micronaire, maturity ratio, length, length uniformity, bundle strength, and single fiber strength are desired by the textile industry to produce increasingly high quality products and to take full advantage of modern spinning technologies. Fiber quality parameters should also be high enough for<br><br>
the cotton producer to avoid price discounts when he sells his crop to the gin. For example, in a short growing season on the Texas Southern High Plains, producers often suffer price discounts due to low micronaire. Increasingly high fiber quality achieved through breeding has become a required standard in the cotton industry, and market forces may change so producers are more routinely rewarded with price premiums for higher quality cotton. Therefore, stabilizing or increasing fiber quality under diverse environmental conditions through genetic engineering will increase the profitablity of cotton crop production and provide a new spectrum of material properties for exploitation by the processing industries.<br>
Other plant fibers, although often of different tissue origin, share structural features in common with cotton fibers in being elongated ceils with cellulose-rich walls. Like cotton fibers, other plant fibers of industrial use are required to have high quality as defined by factors such as cellulose content and wall thickness, diameter, fineness (or coarseness), length, strength, durability, uniformity-', elasticity7, and elongation. There is an optimum range of such parameters for each particular fiber source and industrial use. Taking examples from wood fibers used after pulping in paper production, longer fiber length and higher single fiber elongation both promote higher paper tear strength. In addition, thick fiber walls promote high pulp yield and production of absorbent paper with high tearing resistance. However, thinner fiber walls promote fiber collapse and better inter-fiber bonding that aids production of high quality writing paper. Therefore, there exists a need to control cell wall thickness and other fiber quality parameters in either negative or positive directions in diverse fibers to improve their yield or quality or expand the range of their industrial utility.<br>
.Maximizing crop productivity and utility per acre is a key component of sustainable agriculture. Enhanced production of multiple products from the same crop, such as seed and fiber, would be useful. Similarly, it will be an advantage to maximize the possibility of a successful crop harvest, for example by generating plants with stiffer stems that can better resist lodging in the field without sacrificing the yield of a seed crop.<br>
An increasing level of CCb in the atmosphere is a concern due to predicted association of rising global temperatures. There exists a need for plants that are better able to immobilize C02 by conversion of it into useful products, especially products that are typically not burned to regenerate C(X<br><br>
Cotton leaves assimilate most carbon into starch during the day. and the starch is converted to sucrose at night for translocation to sinks. As just described, cotton fibers are not well adapted to use this sucrose efficiently for cellulose synthesis during cool nights. Therefore, cool nights reduce cotton photosynthetic efficiency during the following warm day (Warner et al.. "Response of Carbon Metabolism to Night Temperatures in Cotton," Agron. J.. 87:1193-1197 (1995)), possibly due to hindered use of carbohydrate at night. The resulting leaf carbohydrate accumulation could signal a down-regulation of photosynthetic genes. The excess starch remaining in the leaf after a cool night could be involved in some negative feedback mechanism reducing photosynthetic rates even after re-warming. There is a need to use genetic engineering to alleviate the cool-night-associated inhibition of photosynthesis during the following warm day.<br>
Sucrose phosphate synthase C'SPS") is a key protein involved in carbon metabolism in plants (See Figure 1). SPS catalyzes the formation of sucrose phosphate from UDP-glucose and fructose 6-phosphate. In the leaf. SPS is important in controlling the partitioning of reduced carbon between starch and translocatable sucrose (Huber et al., '"Role and Regulation of Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase in Higher Plants/' Annu. Rev. Plant Phvsiol. Plant Mol. Biol., 47:431-44 (1996)). In growing sink cells, the data in this invention demonstrate that SPS is involved in directing the flow of carbon to cellulose. Its level of activity can regulate the amount of metabolic flux directed toward cellulose synthesis compared to respiration (See Figure 2). According to this model. SPS within cellulose-storing sink ceils can increase sink strength through an enhanced rate of cellulose synthesis by promoting sucrose synthesis in one or both of two cases: (a) if sucrose transported from the leaves is cleaved to release glucose and fructose before or after entering the sink cells: and/or (b) to reuse the fructose released by the activity of sucrose synthase to channel UDP-glucose and fructose to cellulose synthase. A decreased level of SPS activity can decrease sink strength, by analogous mechanisms, in any case where sink filling is affected by sucrose levels.<br>
In tomato, over-expression of SPS has been shown sometimes to cause a 32% increase in total fruit dry weight. This increase was due not to an increase in individual fruit weight, but to a 50% increase in fruit number (Micallef et al.. 'Altered Photosynthesis, Flowering, and Fruiting in Transgenic Tomato Plants That Have an Increased Capacity for Sucrose Synthesis," Planta, 196:327-334 (1995)). These tomato<br><br>
plants have also sometimes been shown to have increased fresh fruit weight per fruit and increased fruit soluble solids (sugars) (Laporte et ah, "Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase Activity and Yield Analysis of Tomato Plants Transformed with Maize Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase,' Planta, 203:253-259 (1997)). These reports provide no information about seed yield since tomato seeds weigh little compared to tomato fruits and seeds were not separated from fruits for weighing.<br>
It should be noted that although cotton bolls and tomatoes are both classified botanically as fruits, the nature of the fruits and the relative importance of the seeds they contain is very different. Tomato fruits are essentially sacks of primary cell walls filled with water and soluble glucose, fructose, and sucrose as storage carbohydrates. These sugars crystallize upon drying, contributing to fruit dry weight. Within the fruit, tomato seeds are not a significant sink due to their small size, and they have no economic value except for propagation of tomato. The fruit is the major sink in tomatoes; it constitutes almost al! of tomato yield and is the only tomato part with significant economic value.<br>
In contrast the cotton fruit is relatively dry and thin-walled. The fruit itself does not constitute any substantial sink in cotton or contribute to cotton yield. It protects the seeds only until boll opening, after which it withers. The fruit has no or little economic value (as compost). Cotton seeds with attached fiber represent the two major sinks of substantial economic value in the cotton crop, The cotton fiber is an elongated epidermal cell of the cotton seed coat: it is defined botanically as a trichome. Therefore, the two major sinks in seeds are: (1) the cotyledons of the seed embryo that store oil and protein: and C) the secondary cell walls of the seed epidermal trichomes (cotton fibers) that store insoluble cellulose. Soluble sugars are not stored in any significant quantity in a mature cotton seed or fruit. Cotton seeds with their attached fiber represent all of the yield in the cotton crop. Therefore, cotton, as well as other fiber producing plants, differ significantly from tomato.<br>
Increased total dry weight of vegetative parts of plants over-expressing SPS has been shown in tomato leaves. In the same study, no change was observed in dry weight of stems and root dry weight decreased (Galtier et al., "Effects of Elevated Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase Activity on Photosynthesis, Assimilate Partitioning, and Growth in Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var UC82BK" Plant PhvsioL 101:535-543 (1993)). Tomato leaves do not contain substantial fiber, being composed mainly of mesophyll cells and conducting vascular tissue. The same plants were shown to sometimes have<br><br>
increased dry weight on a whole-plant basis (Ferrari o-Mery el al., "Manipulation of the Pathways of Sucrose Biosynthesis and Nitrogen Assimilation in Transformed Plants to Improve Photosynthesis and Productivity/' in Foyer, eds., A Molecular Approach to Pnmarv Metabolism in Higher Plants. Taylor and FrancisrNew York, pp. 125-153 (1997)) and in above-ground parts including leaves plus stems (Laporte et al., "Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase Activity and Yield Analysis of Tomato Plants Transformed with Maize Sucrose-Phosphate Synthase/1 Planta, 203:253-259 (1997)). In potatoes over-expressing SPS, increased total dry weight of tubers has been shown (Shewmaker. 'Modification of Soluble Solids Using Sucrose Phosphate Synthase Encoding Sequences/' PCT International Publication Number WO 97/15678). Potato tubers do not contain substantial fiber. They are composed mainly of parenchyma ceils with primary walks thai store abundant starch and lesser amounts of protein. The major yield component of potato tubers is starch. All of these reports lack information on the effect of SPS over-expression on cell wall thickness, cellulose content, and fiber and seed yield of plants. However, the absence of demonstrated increase in stem weight argues against increased fiber content in the tomato plants analyzed.<br>
Increased expression of SPS has been shown to exert other beneficial effects in tomato and Arabidopsis. In both species, leaf starch storage is reduced in preference for synthesis of sucrose. In both species, maximal rates of photosynthesis are enhanced, most significantly in elevated CO? and saturating light (Galtier et a!.. 'Effects of Light and Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Enrichment on Photosynthesis and Carbon Partitioning in the Leaves of Tomato (Lycopersicon escukntum L.) Plant Over-Expressing Sucrose Phosphate Synthase." J. Expt. Bot.. 46:1335-1344 (1995); Micallef et al.. "Altered Photosynthesis. Flowering, and Fruiting in Transgenic Tomato Plants That Have an Increased Capacity for Sucrose Synthesis/' Planta, 196:327-334 CI995): and Signora et al.. "'Over-Expression of Sucrose Phosphate Synthase in Arabidopsis thaliana Results in increased Foliar Carbohydrate Accumulation in Plants After Prolonged Growth with CO: Enrichment/" J. Expt. Bot.. 49:669-680 (1998)). However, these reports provide no information related to effects of cool nights on photosynthesis during the warm day.<br>
Thus, there exists a need for a method to control the level of synthesis of cellulose in fiber producing plants, in particular cotton. There exists a need to be-able to control the yield and quality of fibers of commercial value, in particular cotton, under diverse environmental conditions. A general need exists to be able to control the synthesis of<br><br>
cellulose and the thickness of cell walls in plants. A general need exists to promote photosvnthetic efficiency in plants growing under cool night temperatures. It is important to be able to increase seed yield in crops as well. The present invention addresses those needs and provides improved plants.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a method of controlling the cellulose synthesis in plants to optimize the level of production and quality of the products derived from the plants.<br>
The invention includes the regulation in the cellulose content, thickness, or yield of any plant cell wall of agricultural or industrial use. Such cell walls include typical thin primary cell walls such as those that are digested in forage and those that exist in useful agricultural residues, for example beet root parenchyma cells remaining after sugar extraction that can be converted into thickening agents. Such cell walls include thick walls such as those of collenchyma and xylem parenchyma that can aid plant rigidity or contribute to yield and digestibility of forage or other agricultural products. Such ceil walls also include secondary ceil walls such as are commonly found in fiber.<br>
In particular, the present invention provides a transgenic cotton plant that has an increased level of sucrose phosphate synthetase relative to a non-transgenic cotton plant.<br>
The invention also provides a method of increasing the yield of a cotton plant by introducing into the cotton plant a chimeric DNA construct that alters the level of sucrose phosphate synthase activity in an amount sufficient to increase the seed and fiber yield of the cotton plant.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the pathways of carbon assimilation, starch synthesis and catabolism, and sucrose synthesis. UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylasc catalyzes the highly reversible reaction between glucose 1-phosphate (G-I-P) and UDP-glucose.  Sucrose-phosphate synthase catalyzes the formation of sucrose-phosphate from UDP-glucose and fructose 6-phosphate.<br>

Figure 4 is an amino acid alignment between the spinach leaf SPS gene sequence and a homologous sequence from Synechocystis.<br>
Figure 5 is a histogram of fiber weight per seed, which shows elevation in all three transgenic lines. (Here and in all subsequent histograms, the error bars are standard deviations of the average. The average values are printed above each bar.)<br>
Figure 6 is a histogram of delinted seed weight per seed. It shows elevation in all three transgenic lines.<br>
Figure 7 is a histogram of the ratio of fiber weight per seed and delinted seed weight per seed.  It shows that these two yield parameters tend to increase in parallel, with a small preference for increased fiber weight in transgenic lines.<br>
Figure 8 is a scatter plot of fiber weight per seed vs delinted seed weight per seed. It shows that these two parameters are interdependent at the 50% level. (Here and with all other scatter plots. R" is the coefficient of determination calculated from the linear regression line. Also, data points from parental C312 are labeled to their right, whereas data point from the three transgenic lines are left unlabeled.) Note, however, that C312 does not shown any linear relationship because seed weight per seed shows little variability in the parental line. Therefore, the overall linear relationship among all the data points derives from the transgenic plants. The transgenic plants have more variability in and higher levels of delinted seed weight per seed and fiber weight per seed than parental C312 plants.<br>
Figure 9 is a histogram of fuzz fiber weight per seed. It shows elevation in two of three transgenic lines, and a decrease in one transgenic line.<br>
Figure 10 is a histogram of micronaire, which shows elevation in all three transgenic lines.<br>
Figure 11 is a scatter plot of micronaire vs fiber weight per seed showing that these two parameters are interdependent at the 60% level. This is sensible since fiber weight per seed depends on 3 factors: number of fibers, length of fibers, and fiber wall thickness. Of these 3 factors, micronaire would depend only on fiber wall thickness. Note that this linear relationship also holds for C312, but the transgenics have higher values for fiber weight per seed and micronaire.<br>
Figure 12 is a histogram of grams of force to break a single fiber (Tb: g).  It shows elevation in all transgenic lines.<br><br>
Figure 13 is a histogram of elongation to break a single fiber (% of original fiber length). It shows elevation in all transgenic lines. However, note that Elongation is highest in transgenic line 13-3a. which, among the transgenics, had the lowest increase in grams to break. This suggests that these two factors are primarily determined by different fiber properties, as would be predicted in theory and is confirmed by the scatter plots below.<br>
Figure 14 is a histogram of work to break a single fiber (JIJ). Work, which is a composite factor calculated from grams to break and elongation, is elevated in all transgenic lines.<br>
Figure 15 is a scatter plot of grams offeree to break a single fiber vs. micronaire. The graph shows an interdependency for these parameters over all data points of 68%. Both of these parameters would be expected to increase with a thicker fiber wall.<br>
Figure 16 is a scatter plot of grams offeree to break a single fiber vs. fiber weight per seed. These parameters are interdependent at a level of 61%. which is similar to the dependence on micronaire (See Figure 15). This supports the hypothesis that increased fiber weight per seed is due in large part to increased fiber wall thickness, since the two other parameters that can increase fiber weight per seed (increased fiber number and increased fiber length) would not be expected to increase grams to break.<br>
Figure 17 is a scatter plot of work to break a single fiber vs. micronaire. These parameters are interdependent at a level of 48%. The intermediary level of dependency compared to grams to break and elongation alone (See Figure 19) is reasonable for this composite factor.<br>
Figure 18 is a scatter plot of work to break a single fiber vs. fiber weight per seed. These parameters are interdependent at a level of 39%. which is similar to the dependence on micronaire (See Figure 17). As just described for Figure 16, this supports the hypothesis that increased fiber weight per seed is due in large part to increased fiber wall thickness.<br>
Figure 19 is a scatter plot of elongation to break vs. micronaire. The graph shows that these parameters are not interdependent. Therefore, over-expression of SPS is predicted to enhance elongation by a mechanism independent of fiber wall thickness, which is consistent with theory.<br>
Figure 20 is four overlayed scatter plots of photosynthetic rate vs. internal C02 concentration for parental C312 growing in the Phytotrom Empty symbols are for two<br><br>
plants growing at 30/15°C and filled symbols are for two plants growing at 30/28°C. All plants were assayed at 30°C. The graphs show that for parental C312, a previous cool night suppresses photosynthetic rate during the warm day.<br>
Figure 21 is four overlayed scatter plots of photosynthetic rate vs. internal C02 concentration for the transgenic line 13-3a-l growing in the Phytotron. Empty symbols are for two plants growing at 30/15°C and filled symbols are for two plants growing at 30/28°C. All plants were assayed at 30°C. The graphs show that for this transgenic line, a previous cool has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis during the next warm day.<br>
Figure 22 is four overlayed scatter plots of photosynthetic rate vs. internal C02 concentration for the transgenic line 225-17a growing in the Phytotron. Empty symbols are for two plants growing at 30/15°C and filled symbols are for two plants growing at 30'2R°C. All plants were assayed at 30°C. The graphs show that for this transgenic line, a previous cool has no effect on the rate of photosynthesis during the next warm day.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of controlling the cellulose synthesis in plants to optimize the level of production and quality of the products, in particular fiber, derived from the plants.<br>
The word 'Tiber is often used to unify a diverse group of plant cell types that share in common the features of having an elongated shape and abundant cellulose in thick cell walls, usually, but not always, described as secondary walls. Such walls may or may not be lignifled, and the protoplast of such cells may or may not remain alive at maturity. Such fibers have many industrial uses, for example in lumber and manufactured wood products, paper, textiles, sacking and boxing material, cordage, brushes and brooms, filling and stuffing, caulking, reinforcement of other materials, and manufacture of cellulose derivatives. In some industries, the term "fiber" is usually inclusive of thick-walled conducting cells such as vessels and tracheids and to fibrillar aggregates of manv individual fiber cells. Here the term "fiber1 is used in its most inclusive sense, for example including: (a) thick-walled conducting and non-conducting cells of the xylem; (b) fibers of extraxylary origin, including those from phloem, bark. ground tissue, and epidermis; and (c) fibers from stems, leaves, roots, seeds, and flowers or inflorescences (such as those of Sorghum vulgare used in the manufacture of brushes<br><br>
and brooms). In addition to wood from trees, cotton, and forage crops, the invention is applicable to all fibers, including, but not exclusively, those in agricultural residues such as corn, sugar cane, and rice stems that can be used in pulping, flax, hemp, ramie, jute, kenaf kapok, coir, bamboo, Spanish moss, abaca, and Agave spp. (e.g. sisal).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the invention provides a transgenic cotton plant wherein the transgenic cotton plant has an increased level of sucrose phosphate synthetase relative to a non-transgenic cotton plant. Table 1 shows the level of SPS activity from untransformed C312 plants and four transformed plant lines. All transformed plant lines show significant increases in SPS activity in both leaves and fiber.<br>
Sucrose phosphate synthase plays a key role in the metabolic flux of carbon within plant cells. Genes encoding sucrose phosphate synthase have been isolated and sequenced from a number of plant species.

U.S. Patent No. 5.665,892-A. which are hereby incorporated by reference.] A comparison of several of the available SPS gene sequences from higher plants is provided in Figure 3. A comparison of a Synechocystis SPS (Kaneko et al., DNA Res.. 2(4): 153-166 (1995). which is hereby incorporated by reference) with the spinach SPS is provided in Figure 4; this protein from a cyanobacterium has as strong a homology with spinach SPS as all the higher plant proteins have among themselves. Preferred sucrose phosphate synthase genes include the genes isolated from spinach. Arabidopsis. beet, bean, citrus, maize, moss, potato, rice, sugar cane, and Synechocystis, The most preferred sucrose phosphate synthetase is spinach sucrose phosphate synthetase.<br>
In addition to the known sequences of sucrose phosphate synthase, modifications of the known sequences are also within the scope of the invention. Variations in the<br><br>
sequence including substitutions, insertions and deletions may be made to the known sequences of sucrose phosphate synthase. Comparisons of all the available sequences indicate which amino acids are highly conserved and those that are variable. Using that information, it is possible to choose variations that should still produce functional proteins.<br>
The maximum activity of sucrose phosphate-synthase may be determined colorimetrically according to the formation of sucrose-6-P (+ sucrose) from fructose-6-P and UDP-glucose by the method as described in (Copeland. "Enzymes of Sucrose Metabolism." Methods in Plant Biochemistry, 3:73-83 (1990). which is hereby incorporated by reference). Frozen leaf or fiber tissue was pulverized under liquid nitrogen, then ground in 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 10 mM MgC12, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA. 10% glycerol, and 0.1% Triton-X-100. A 28 uJ aliquot of each supernatant was used in each SPS assay, and each extract was tested in triplicate. A 70 fil assay mixture contained 50 mM HEPES (pH 7,4), 10 mM UDPG, 6 mM fructose-6-P. 20 mM glucose-6-P (an SPS activator), 10 mM MgC12, 1 mM EDTA, 0.40 mM EGTA, 4.0% glycerol, and 0.04% Triton-X-100. The assay was conducted for 10 min at 32 - 34°C (on the plateau of maximal activity) then terminated by addition of 70 ul of IN NaOH. Unreacled hexoses or hexose phosphates were destroyed by immersion of tubes in a boiling water bath for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, 250ul of 0.1% resorcinol in ethanol and 750 u.1 of concentrated HCl were added, followed by incubation for 8 min at 80°C. The tubes were quickly cooled to room temperature, A520nm was measured in a spectrophotometer, and sucrose levels in plant extracts were determined in reference to a sucrose standard curve. Triplicate controls were made for each extract to normalize for possible different endogenous levels of sucrose in each extract. For controls. NaOH was added to the assay tube before the plant extract was added; then these tubes were processed in parallel as above except for the step of assay termination by NaOH that was already done. Plant extracts were also analyzed for protein content by Bradford protein assay and leaf extracts were analyzed for chlorophyll content by its absorbance to allow comparison of SPS activities between different samples. Alternatively, the activity of sucrose phosphate-synthase may be determined spectrophotometrically according to liberation of uridineo'-diphosphate detected by a pyruvate-kinase coupling enzyme reaction as also described in (Copeland, "Enzymes of<br><br>
Sucrose Metabolism," Methods in Plant Biochemistry, 3:73-83 (1990), which is hereby-incorporated by reference).<br>
In order to express the sucrose phosphate synthase in plants, transgenic plants carrying the gene encoding a sucrose phosphate synthase are produced by transforming a plant with a chimeric DNA construct that expresses sucrose phosphate synthase.<br>
In order to express the sucrose phosphate synthase gene from the chimeric DNA, the construct should include a plant specific promoter. The promoter should ensure that the foreign gene is expressed in the plant. The promoter can be chosen so that the expression occurs only in specified tissues, at a determined time point in the plant's development or at a time point determined by outside influences. The promoter can be homologous or heterologous to the plant. Suitable promoters include e.g. the RUBISCO small subunit promoter, fiber-specific promoters, the promoter of the 35S RNA of the cauliflower mosaic virus described in U.S. Patent No. 5,034,322 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), the enhanced 35S promoter described in U.S. Patent No. 5.106.739 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), the dual S35 promoter, the FMY promoter from figwort mosaic vims that is described in U.S. Patent No. 5.378,619 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), the RI T-DNA promoter described in U.S. Patent No. 5.466.792 (which is hereby incorporated by reference), the octopine T-DNA promoter described in U.S. Patent No. 5.428,147 {which is hereby incorporated by-reference), the alcohol dehydrogenase 1 promoter (Callis et ah.

Preferred promoters include the RUBISCO small subunit promoter, the 35S promoters, fiber enhanced promoters, vascular cell enhanced promoters, stem cell enhanced promoters, or seed enhanced promoters. Such promoters may ensure<br><br>
expression in a tissue specific or tissue-enhanced manner, but may allow expression in other cell types. For example it may ensure enhanced expression in photosynthetically active tissues (RUB1SCO (Worrell et ah, The Plant Cell. 3:1121-1130 (1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference)) or other mesophyll-cell-specific promoter (Datta et al., Theor. Appl. Genet., 97:20-30 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference) or fibers (cotton-fiber-, xylern fiber-, or extra-xylary-fiber-specific or enhanced promoters). Other promoters can be used that ensure expression only in specified organs, such as the leaf root, tuber, seed. stem, flower or specified cell types such as parenchyma, epidermal, or vascular cells. One example of a tissue specific promoter is the RB7 promoter that is root specific (U.S. Patent No. 5.459,252, which is hereby incorporated by reference). Such promoters may be used either alone or in combination to optimize over-expression in the most desirable set of tissues or organs.<br>

Preferred promoters enhancing expression in vascular tissue include the CAD 2 promoter (Samaj et al.. Planta. 204:437-443 (1998). which is hereby incorporated by reference], the Pt4Cll promoter (Hu et aL Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 95:5407-5412 (1998). which is hereby incorporated by reference), the C4H promoter (Meyer et aL Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 95:6619-6623 (1998). which is hereby incorporated by reference). the PtX3H6 and PtX14A9 promoters (Loopstra et aL, Plant Moi.

Biol.. 33:729-735 (1997), which is hereby incorporated by reference), the Hvhspl7 promoter (Raho et aL J. Expt. BoU 47:1587-1594 (1996), which is hereby incorporated<br><br>
by reference), and the COMT promoter (Capellades et al. Plant Mol. Biol.. 31:307-322 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Preferred promoters enhancing expression in stem tissue include pith promoters (Datta. Theor. APDI. Genet.. 97:20-30 (1998) and Ohta et al., Mol. Gen. Genet.. 225:369-378 (1991). which are hereby incorporated by reference), and the anionic peroxidase promoter (Klotz et al. Plant Mol. Biol.. 36:509-520 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference). Preferred promoters enhancing expression in phloem, cortex and cork, but not xylem or pith, include the Psam-1 promoter (Mijnsbrugge et al. Plant and Cell PhvsioL 37:1108-1115 (1996), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Preferred promoters enhancing expression in seeds include the phas promoter (Geest et al.. Plant Mol. Biol. 32:579-588 (1996)); the GluB-1 promoter (Takaiwa et ah. Plant Mol. Biol. 30:1207-1221 (1996)); the gamma-zein promoter (Torrent et al. Plant Mol. Biol. 34:139-149 (1997)), and the oleosin promoter (Sarmiento etal. The Plant Journal 11:783-796 (1997V).<br>
Truncated or synthetic promoters including specific nucleotide regions conferring tissue-enhanced expression may also be used, as exemplified by identification of regulatory elements within larger promoters conferring xylcm-enhanced expression (Seguin et al.. Plant Mol. Biol.. 35:281-291 (1997); Torres-Schumann et al. The Plant Journal. 9:283-296 (1996); and Leyva et al.. The Plant Cell. 4:263-271 (1992). which are hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention the chimeric DNA construct is stable! v integrated into the genome of the cotton plant. When a plant is transformed by Agrobaaerium mediated transformation, a portion of the Ti plasmid integrates into the plant genome and is stablely passed on to future generations of plant cells.<br>
Numerous methods exist for transforming plant cells. The preferred methods include electroporation. Agrobaaerium mediated transformation, biolistic gene transformation, chemically mediated transformation, or microinjection.<br>
The vector described above can be microinjected directly into plant cells by use of micropipettes to transfer mechanically the recombinant DNA (Crossway. Mol. Gen. Genetics. 202:179-185 (1985), which is hereby incorporated by reference). The genetic material may also be transferred into the plant cell using polyethylene glycol (Krens et al. Nature. 296:72-74 (1982), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br><br>
Another approach to transforming plant cells with a gene that increases fiber and seed yield and fiber quality is particle bombardment (also known as biolistic transformation) of the host cell. This can be accomplished in one of several ways. The first involves propelling inert or biologically active particles at cells. This technique is disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,945,050, 5,036,006, and 5,100,792, all to Sanford et al., which are hereby incorporated by reference. Generally, this procedure involves propelling inert or biologically active particles at the cells under conditions effective to penetrate the outer surface of the cell and to be incorporated within the interior thereof. When inert particles are utilized, the vector can be introduced into the cell by coating the particles with the vector containing the heterologous DNA. Alternatively, the target cell can be surrounded by the vector so that the vector is carried into the ceil by the wake of the particle. Biologically active particles (e.g., dried bacterial cells containing the vector and heterologous DNA) can also be propelled into plant cells.<br>
Yet another method of introduction is fusion of protoplasts with other entities, either minicells. cells, lysosomes or other fusible lipid-surfaced bodies (Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 79:1859-63 (1982), which is hereby incorporated by-reference).<br>
The DNA molecule may also be introduced into the plant cells by electroporation (Fromm et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 82:5824 (1985), which is hereby incorporated by reference), in this technique, plant protoplasts are electroporated in the presence of plasmids containing the expression cassette. Electrical impulses of high field strength rcvcrsibly permcabilizc biomembranes allowing the introduction of the plasmids. Electroporated plant protoplasts reform the cell wall, divide, and regenerate.<br>
Another method of introducing the DNA molecule into plant cells is to infect a plant cell with Agrobacterium tumefaciens ox A. rhizogenes previously transformed with the gene. Under appropriate conditions known in the art. the transformed plant cells are grown to form shoots or roots, and develop further into plants. Generally, this procedure involves inoculating the plant tissue with a suspension of bacteria and incubating the tissue for 48 to 72 hours on regeneration medium without antibiotics at 25-28°C<br>
Agrobacterium is a representative genus of the gram-negative family Rhizobiaceae. Its species are responsible for crown gall {A. tumefaciens) and hairy root disease (A. rhizogenes). The plant cells in crown gall tumors and hairy roots are induced to produce amino acid derivatives known as opines, which are catabolized only by the<br><br>
bacteria. The bacterial genes responsible for expression of opines are a convenient source of control elements for chimeric expression cassettes. In addition, assaying for the presence of opines can be used to identify transformed tissue.<br>
Heterologous genetic sequences can be introduced into appropriate plant cells, by means of the Ti plasmid of A. tumefaciens or the Ri plasmid of A. rhizogenes. The Ti or Ri plasmid is transmitted to plant cells on infection by Agrobacterium and is stably integrated into the plant genome (Schell. Science. 237:1176-83 (1987), which ishereby incorporated by reference).<br>
After transformation, whole transformed plants can be recovered. If transformed seeds were produced directly, these can be selected by germination on selection medium and grown into plants (Glough et al. The Plant Journal 16:735-743 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference). If transformed pollen was produced directly, this can be used for in vivo pollination followed by selection of transformed seeds (Touraev et al., The Plant Journal 12:949-956 (1997), which is hereby incorporated by reference). If meristems were transformed, these can be grown into plants in culture then transferred to soil (Gould, J. et al.. Plant Cell Rep. 10:12-16 (1991), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
If protoplasts or expiants were transformed, plants can be regenerated. Plant regeneration from cultured protoplasts is described in Evans et al.. Handbook of Plant Cell Cultures. Vol. 1. New York, New York:MacMilIan Publishing Co., (1983); and Vasil. ed.. Cell Culture and Somatic Cell Genetics of Plants. Orlando:Acad. Press, Vol. I (1984). and Vol. Ill (1986), which are hereby incorporated by reference. Means for regeneration vary7 from species to species of plants, but generally a suspension of transformed protoplasts or a petri plate containing transformed expiants is first provided. Callus tissue is formed and shoots may be induced from callus and subsequently rooted. Alternatively, embryo formation can be induced in the callus tissue. These embryos germinate as natural embryos to form plants. The culture media will generally contain various amino acids and hormones, such as auxin and cytokinins. It is also advantageous to add glutamic acid and proline to the medium, especially for such species as corn and alfalfa. Efficient regeneration will depend on the medium, on the genotype, and on the history of the culture. If these three variables are controlled, then regeneration is usually reproducible and repeatable.<br><br>
It is known that practically all plants can be regenerated from cultured ceils or tissues, including but not limited to, species of sugarcane, sugar beets, cotton, forest trees, forage crops, and fiber producing plants. Regeneration is also possible in seed-producing plants including, but not limited to, maize, rice, wheat, soybean, rape, sunflower, and peanut.<br>
After the expression cassette is stably incorporated in transgenic plants, it can be transferred to other plants by sexual crossing. Any of a number of standard breeding techniques can be used, depending upon the species to be crossed.<br>
Once transgenic plants of this type are produced, the plants themselves can be cultivated in accordance with conventional procedure with the presence of the gene encoding the sucrose phosphate synthase resulting in enhanced seed yield and/or enhanced fiber yield and/or enhanced fiber quality. Alternatively, transgenic seeds are recovered from the transgenic plants. These seeds can then be planted in the soil and cultivated using conventional procedures to produce transgenic plants.<br>
The present invention also provides seeds produced from the transgenic plant having increased synthesis of sucrose phosphate synthase.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention provides a method of increasing the yield of cotton plant by introducing into a cotton plant a chimeric DNA construct that alters sucrose phosphate synthase activity in an amount sufficient to increase the yield of the cotton plant. A chimeric gene may be introduced into plant cells or tissue. Transformed cells are selected, usually by the use of a selectable marker. The transformed cells are then used to generate a transformed plant (Fraley et aL Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 79:1859-1863 (1982), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
Preferred plants are cotton plants. The transformed plants may have an increase in the yield of cotton seeds or cotton fiber.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of increasing the quality of cotton fiber produced from a cotton plant by'introducing into a cotton plant a chimeric DNA construct that alters the sucrose phosphate synthase activity in an amount sufficient to increase the quality of the cotton fiber produced by the cotton plant.<br>
The level of sucrose phosphate synthase may be increased by expressing factors that increase the level of expression of the gene. Such factors may act on regulatory sites controlling expression that are normally located near the sucrose phosphate synthase gene or heterologous regulatory sites located near the gene in a chimeric construct.<br><br>
Alternatively, the level of sucrose phosphate synthase may be increased by introducing a chimeric DNA construct that directly expresses a sucrose phosphate synthase.<br>
Generally, the present invention can be used to change the ratio of cellulose to the dry weight of the whole plant or to the dry weight of plant components by introducing into a plant a chimeric DNA construct capable of altering sucrose phosphate synthase activity in an amount sufficient to change the ratio of cellulose to the dry weight of the whole plant or plant components. The change in cellulose can be observed in relation to total weight of the plant or fractionated parts of plants including, but not exclusively, starch, total cell walls, cell wall of fibers, particular organs such as stems, or cell wall components such as pectins, hemicelluloses, proteins, extractives, and Hgnin. The change in the ratio of cellulose to the fractionated parts of plants can be observed when the fractionated parts are considered alone or in any additive combination.<br>
Changes in qualities as claimed in this invention refer to changes of at least 10% compared to a plant lacking the transgene. For example, the ratio of cellulose in cell walls may be changed from 20% to 18% or lower or 22% or higher. Such change compared to parental level could apply to all cell walls or any cell wall fraction of a plant.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the dry weight of cellulose may be increased so that its ratio to other dry weight components exceeds 40%.  Such increase to exceed 40% could apply to wood, fibers, and other cellulose-rich cell walls such as collenchyma and thickened xylem parenchyma.<br>
To accomplish certain changes, the level of sucrose phosphate synthase may be decreased by expressing factors that decrease the level of expression of the gene. Such factors may act on regulator}' sites controlling expression that are normally located near the sucrose phosphate synthase gene or heterologous regulatory sites located near the gene in a chimeric construct. Alternatively, in anti-sense technology, the level of sucrose phosphate synthase may be decreased by introducing a chimeric DNA construct that contains the complementary cDNA of a sucrose phosphate synthase (Arndt et aL Genome, 40:785-797 (1997), which is hereby incorporated by reference). Alternatively, decreased SPS activity might be induced by homology dependent gene silencing (Wassenegger et al. Plant Mol. Biol. 37:349-362 (1998), which is hereby incorporated by reference), virus-induced gene silencing (Baulcombe, Curr. Op. Plant Biol. 2:109-113 (1999). which is hereby incorporated by reference), chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (Zhu et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 15:8768-8773 (1999). which is hereby<br><br>
incorporated by reference), or homologous recombination (Shalev et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:7398-7402 (1999), which is hereby incorporated by reference).<br>
In yet another embodiment, the invention provides a method of increasing tolerance of photosynthetic efficiency to cool night temperatures by introducing into a plant a chimeric DNA construct capable of altering sucrose phosphate synthase activity in an amount sufficient to increase tolerance of photosynthetic efficiency to cool night temperatures.<br>
The present invention can be used to regulate the thickness of cell walls in a plant by introducing into the plant a chimeric DNA construct that will change the sucrose phosphate synthase activity, In particular, the method can be used to increase the yield of harvestable fiber from any fiber producing plant.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the plant is a fiber producing plant. More preferred fiber producing plants are sugarcane, sugar beets, forest trees, forage crops, fiber producing plants, and seed producing plants.<br>
In yet another embodiment the present invention can be used to increase the harvestable yield of fiber from a plant. The invention may also be used to alter the quality of fiber isolated from the plant... Changes in sucrose phosphate synthase can change fiber strength, fiber length, or weight per unit length. Changes may either increase or decrease the strength, length or weight per unit length.<br>
The present invention can be used to increase the yield of seed harvested from a seed producing plant by introducing into the plant a chimeric DNA construct that will increase the sucrose phosphate synthase activity.<br>
The methods of the invention are broadly applicable and can be used in a wide variety of plants including cotton, forest trees, forage crops, beets, flax, hemp, jute, and other fiber-producing plants. They can also be used in seed producing plants including cotton, flax, wheat, rice, corn, soybean. Brassica sp. (e.g. rape), sunflower, safflovver. peanut, palm, and other seed producing plants.<br>
The methods of the invention are further described in the examples that follow.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1 - Materials and Methods<br>
Most plants described were grown in one chamber at the Duke University Phytotron: 360 ppm (normal) C02; 30715-19°C day/night cycle; 14h day/1 Oh night; 1200 umol m"~s_1 (metal halide) illumination; irrigation 2x daily with 1/2 strength Hoagland's solution; potted in a mixture of gravel and sand in 4 gallon pots. A change to 30/19°C from 30/3 5°C occurred after about 4 months growth, which was about half-way through the maturation of first bolls in C312 and all transgenic lines. This temperature condition is subsequently referred to as 30/15°C for simplicity. This chamber is emphasized because its temperature and CCK conditions represent those likely to be encountered by cotton crops in the field, for example hut not exclusively on the Texas Southern High Plains.<br>
Other plants were grown in the Duke University Phytotron in 3 other chambers as described except with the following changes: (a) 360 ppm CO2, 30728°C day/night cycle: (b) 700 ppm (elevated) C02. 30°'15-19°C day/night cycle: and (c) 700 ppm C02s 30o/28°C day/night cycle.<br>
Other plants were grown in the Texas Tech University greenhouse: natural CO? and illumination; approximately 32/22°C day/night cycle; 2 gallon pots; irrigation 2-3x daily: slow-release fertilizer in the soil and soluble fertilizer applied Ix weekly.<br>
All open boils were harvested from each plant from which seed and fiber parameters were evaluated. Lint fiber was removed from the seeds by hand-stripping. Cotton seeds are covered with lint fiber (the long fiber used for textiles) and fuzz fiber (short fibers used in various industrial applications). (Lint) fiber weight and fuzzy seed weight from each plant was determined by weighing. Hereafter, 'fiber' refers to lint fiber, with fuzz fiber specified when necessary. Seed number per plant was determined by counting. (Seeds and fiber of underdeveloped "motes" were not included.) Fiber was sent to Cotton Incorporated, Raleigh. NC for HVL AFIS. and Mantis fiber quality analysis. Seeds from the 30/15°C chamber were subsequently acid-delinted. air-dried. and weighed. From this chamber, fuzz fiber weight per seed was determined by subtraction of the weights of fuzzy and delinted seeds.<br><br>
For plants for which stem weight was determined, any unopened bolls and leaves and petioles were removed. Above-ground stems were oven-dried and weighed.<br>
The plant line used is a Coker 312 wild-type (untransformed parent) and four transgenic lines. Transgenic plant lines, each known to represent separate transformation events, are designated 13-3a, 225-17a, 40-4b, and 40-6a. TO, Tl, or T2 represent primary transformants and the first and second filial generations, respectively. All transgenic plants tested were Kanamycin resistant as determined from formation of lateral roots of germinating seedlings within agar containing Kanamycin. The segregation ratio of seeds germinated on kanamycin is expressed as resistant/sensitive ratio (Table 1). Ratios were assessed after 7-14 days to include most slow-germinating seeds.<br>
The number of individual plants grown in the Phytotron to yield average data for each parameter (except for 40-6a-4) is indicated as Phytotron Plants (n) (Table 2). Line 40-6a-4, although it generally performed consistently with the other lines, was omitted from fiber quality averages because it was represented by only one plant in the 30/15°C, 360 ppm COT chamber. Values from two T2 lineages of line 40-4b were averaged together because Tl#l and Tl#4 are similar siblings (except for segregation ratio) that generated similar T2 progeny.<br>
Leaf and fiber RNA levels were determined by Northern analysis of the mRNA for foreign SPS in the leaf, scored as positive or negative (Table 1). Extractable SPS activity (production of sucrose) is standardized as fimol sucrose/mg chlorophyll/hour for leaf activity or as umol sucrose/mg protein/hour for fiber activity (Table 1).<br>
The Boll 3 per Plant is the number of non-aborted bolls on each plant.<br>
The Delinted Seed Weight per Seed (g) and (Lint) Fiber Weight per Seed (g) (Table 2) are data derived from all open bolls of each plant at the time the experiment was terminated. Under 30/28cC. all bolls had opened, but under 30/15°C. some unopened bolls were left on each plant at termination. Each data point represented 192 - 487 seeds yielding 24.5 - 48.5 g lint fiber.<br>
Bulk (or bundle) fiber properties as determined by automated HY1 and AFIS testing are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The fiber micronaire (by HVI) is a unitless measurement that depends both on fiber maturity (or wall thickness determined by secondary wall cellulose content) and fiber diameter.<br><br>
Fiber bundle strength (by HVI) is expressed in units of (cN/tex). It is the specific strength of the fiber bundle is which the individual fiber fineness (tex) is calculated from the Micronaire value.<br>
Fiber fineness (by AFIS) is expressed as (mTex). It represents the weight, in milligrams, of one kilometer of the fiber. One thousand meters of fibers with a mass of 1 milligram equals 1 millitex.<br>
The fiber maturity ratio (by AFIS) is an expression of the degree of cell wall thickening (depending on secondary cell wall cellulose deposition). It is the ratio of fibers with a 0.5 (or more) circularity ratio divided by the amount of fibers with 0.25 (or less} circularity.  (Fibers with thicker walls are less prone to collapse and remain more circular upon drying.) The higher the maturity ratio, the more mature the fibers arc and the better the fibers are for dyeing.<br>
The immature fiber content ("IFC%", by AFIS) is the percentage of fibers with less than 0.25 maturity. The lower the IFC%? the more suitable the fiber is for dyeing.<br>
Several different units are used as indicators of fiber length. Table 3 shows values for three of these as now described. Upper half mean ("UHJVT. by HVI) is the mean length of the longest one half of the fibers (weight biased). The fiber Uniformity Index ("LT\ by HVI) expresses the ratio of the mean value (Mean Length) to the Upper Half fvlean Length. It is a measure of the fiber length scatter within the population; if all fibers were the same length UT would equal 100%. Short Fiber Content ("SFC %'\ by HV]) is the percentage of fibers less than 1/2" long on a weight basis. HVI is thought to measure Short Fiber Content as determined by genetics only since the measurement does not impose additional potential fiber breaking stress.<br>
Other fiber length indicators discussed in the text are as follows. The weight basis length (LiL(wf [in], by AFIS] is the average length of fibers calculated on a weight basis. The number basis length (ikL(n)v [in], by AFIS) is the mean length of fibers calculated by number. The length i:L5% (n)" [in] (by AFIS) is the 5% span length, or the length spanned by 5% of the fibers when they are parallel and randomly distributed. The length *"L2.5% (n)"" [in] (by AFIS) is the 2.5% span length, or the length spanned by 2.5% of the fibers when they are parallel and randomly distributed. The "UQL (w)" [in] (by AFIS) is the upper quartile length of fibers by weight, or the length exceeded by 25% of the fibers by weight. Finally, the "SFC (nf [in] and "SFC (w)'r [in] (by AFIS) are the percentage of fibers less than 0.50 inches long on a number and weight basis, respectively. In<br><br>
contrast to HVL AFIS beats the fibers before taking these measurements., which has potential to cause fiber breakage. Therefore, AFIS SFC values are a good indication of the characteristics of the fiber after normal processing.<br>
Single fiber strength and elongation parameters derived from Mantis testing are summarized in Table 5. "Tb" [g] is grams offeree to break a single fiber. "Elongation'7 [%] is single fiber elongation before break as % of original length. "Work" [jiJ] is a composite of Tb and Elongation, representing the work expended to break a single fiber.<br>

Example 2 -   Summary of Results Demonstrating Increased Fiber and Seed Yield in Transgenic Plants with Increased SPS Activity<br>
Transgenic cotton plants with spinach SPS under the control of a constitutive promoter showed foreign gene expression in the leaf and fiber as demonstrated by Northern analysis. At the T1/T2 generation, they showed average increased SPS enzyme activity of 3.3 times and 2.3 times in the ieaf and fiber, respectively, compared to parental C312 (Table 1). In this and all following tables, values indicating superior features of transgenic plants compared to parental G312 are shown in bold.<br><br><br>

data.<br>
Over the first 9 weeks of growth in the 30/15°C 360 ppm CO: Phytotron chamber during which plant height and leaf number were measured, the transgenic lines grew similarly to parental C312. The average height of the transgenic plants was 0.90 x the value for parental C312. The average leaf number of the transgenic plants was 1.02 x parental C312.<br>
In the 30/15°C, 360 ppm CO? Phytotron chamber, up-regulated SPS gene expression caused increases in yield components of the fiber and seed crop (Table 2).<br><br><br>
2Average omits line 40-6a because of few replications.<br>
Both cotton fiber and cotton seeds are valuable crops, the lint fibers for use in textiles and other applications and the seeds as a source of oil and seed meal. In addition, short fuzz fibers (also called linters) are harvested as a source of chemical cellulose, among other uses. Increases were observed in number of bolls per plant, seed weight per seed, fiber weight per seed, and fuzz fiber weight per seed. Boll number per plant indicates overall capacity for production of seeds with attached fiber. Furthermore-increased weight of seed and fiber per seed generates increased yield. Transgenic plants over-expressing SPS achieve increased yield of two types of crops at the same time: seed yield based primarily on storage of protein and oil and fiber yield based on storage of cellulose. Therefore, plants that over-express SPS can be predicted to generate more income per acre for The cotton producer based on crop yield alone. Coker 312 plants over-expressing SPS can also be used for future transformations to help overcome any potential yield drag from use of this old cultiver in genetic engineering. Seed and fiber<br><br>
yield can be maximized at the same time in other crop plants, and stiffer stems can be generated to resist lodging without sacrifice of seed yield.<br>
Increased Boll Number per Plant:<br>
Three transgenic lines tested in the 30/15°C, 360 ppm COT chamber with good replication showed 14 - 24% increase in boll number per plant compared to parental C312; with an average increase of 18% (Table 2). Increased boll number of all transgenic lines was also observed in the 30/15°C, 700 ppm C02 and 30/28°C. 700 PPM C02 chambers.<br>
Increased Fiber Weight per Seed:<br>
Three transgenic lines tested in the 30/15°C, 360 ppm CO2 chamber showed 21 -34% increase in fiber weight per seed compared to parental C312. with an average. increase of 25% (Table 2. Fig. 5). This effect was not consistently observed in other chambers. Fiber weight per seed is a composite of fiber number, fiber length, and fiber wall thickness. Since average fiber micronaire (indicating increased wall thickness) and other related factors do increase in all transgenic lines across all chambers (see below), one may infer that unmeasured factors such as changing fiber number might impact fiber weight per seed under nearly constant warm temperature or elevated CO2-<br>
A measurement sometimes taken in lab-based yield analysis is 'lint %'" = (lint fiber weight)/ftotal seed and lint fiber weight). This parameter increases 1.8 - 2.7% for three transgenic lines above the parental C312 value of 31.14% (average increase for transgenics of 2.1 %). This value undcr-estimates fiber yield improvement in transgenic lines because seed weight also increases (see below).<br>
Increased Seed Weight per Seed:<br>
Three transgenic lines tested in the 30/15°C, 360 ppm CO2 chamber showed 11 -22% increase in delinted seed weight per seed compared to parental C312. with an average increase of 18% (Table 2, Fig. 6). Only fuzzy seeds have been weighed from other chambers. However, comparing fuzzy and delinted values from the 30/15°C, 360 ppm CO: chamber indicates that fuzzy seed values are representative of the trends in seed yield. Fuzzy seeds showed increased seed weight per seed in the transgenic lines growing<br><br>
in the other three chambers with only one exception (225-3 7a showed seed weight per seed equal to parental C312 in the 30/28°C 700 ppm CO2 chamber).<br>
The ratio of Fiber Weight per Seed to Delinted Seed Weight per Seed in the 30/15°C. 360 ppm CO2 chamber was increased by an average of 9.0% in three transgenic lines (Fig. 7). A scatter plot of fiber weight per seed vs. delinted seed weight per seed shows that transgenic plants separate from parental C312 through increases in both of these yield components together (Fig. 8). However, there is preferential enhancement of fiber weight compared to seed weight in SPS transgenic plants.<br>
Increased Fuzz Fiber Weight per^eed:<br>
Fuzz fiber weight per seed was obtained by subtracting the unit seed weight of delinted seed from the unit seed weight of fuzzy seeds from the 30/15DC, 360 ppm CO2 chamber (Fig. 9). Two transgenic lines (225-17a and 40-4b) showed increases (averaging 19% increase compared to parental C312) and one transgenic line (13-3a) showed a decrease (19% decrease compared to parental C312). Seeds of line 13-3a also looked blacker before delinting, suggesting initiation of fewer fuzz fibers than on seeds of either parental C312 or the other two transgenic lines. Therefore, transgenic lines show some' variation in numbers of fuzz fibers initiated, but, once initiated, over-expressed SPS enhances their yield similaijy to lint fibers.<br>
Example 3 -   Summary of Results Demonstrating Increased Fiber Quality as Analyzed by Automated HVI and AFIS on Bulk Samples<br>
Many spinning properties of cotton depend on its properties as a bulk sample. HVI and AFIS are automated systems that analyze these properties, yielding<br>
*<br>
complementary information. These analyses show that the quality parameters of fiber produced by SPS transgenic plants are moving as a set into the premium quality range. Fiber from SPS transgenic plants is longer, stronger, and more mature—all these features are currently valued by the cotton processing and textile industries to make high quality fabrics. .Even under a stressful 30/15-19°C temperature cycle typical of the Texas Southern High Plains, the quality of fiber from SPS transgenic plants resembles that of premium cotton such as is traditionally grown in California. Therefore, cotton fiber from SPS transgenic plants can serve an expanded set of end-use markets and sell for a<br><br>
premium price. Producers growing SPS transgenic cotton should also be able to avoid price discounts for inferior quality such a low micronaire that can result from traditional cotton grown on the Texas Southern High Plains. Therefore, SPS transgenic cotton should stabilize or enhance income per acre for the cotton producer based on improved fiber quality.<br>
Improvements Under 30/15°C, 360 ppm CO?:<br>
Key bulk fiber quality parameters from fiber grown in the 30/15°C, 360 ppm CO2 chamber and analyzed by HVI and AFIS are shown in Table 3. Factors of increase for transgenic lines over parental C312 are shown in Table 4.<br>

Micronaire. Three transgenic lines showed an average increase of 28% lo attain an average micronaire of 4.72 (Fig. 10). Micronaire depends on secondary wall thickness and fiber diameter. It is desirable that increases in micronaire occur because of increased secondary wall thickness, not because of increased fiber diameter. The fiber diameter is estimated from the standardized relationship between Fiber Fineness and Fiber Maturity Ratio (Table 3) and found to be little-changed in transgenic lines. Both parental C312 and the transgenic lines had estimated fiber diameter between 16.5 - 17.0 urn. Furthermore, a plot of Micronaire vs. Fiber Weight per Seed shows an interdependence at the 59% level (Fig. 11), supporting the existence of thicker walls in fibers of SPS transgenic plants. Other data on fiber strength, maturity ratio, and immature fiber content (see below) also support an increase in wall thickness of fiber from SPS transgenic plants. Over 90% of the thickness of the cotton fiber wall is due to deposition of almost pure<br><br>
cellulose in the secondary cell wall. Therefore, over-expression of SPS has increased the cellulose content of cotton fibers.<br>
Fiber Bundle Strength. Three transgenic lines showed an average increase of 12% to attain an average bundle strength of 30.3 cN/tex.<br>
Fiber Fineness. Three transgenic lines showed an average increase of 8% to attain an average fineness of ] 80. Higher fiber fineness is traditionally undesirable because it is usually attributed to larger fiber diameter. However, since fiber of SPS transgenic plants has diameter approximately equal to parental C312 (see above), the increased fineness is likely attributable to increased fiber wall thickness yielding more weight per unit length. Therefore, increased fineness of fiber from SPS transgenic plants is expected to be a neutral or positive fiber quality factor.<br>
Fiber Maturity Ratio. Three transgenic lines showed an average increase of 7% to attain an average maturity ratio of 0.95, which falls in the "above average" range (0.95 -1.00). This is superior to parental C312 with its average value of 0.89 in the "mature" range (0.85 - 0.95).<br>
Immature Fiber Content. Three transgenic lines showed an average decrease of 1.84% to attain an average of 5,61% immature fibers. Transgenic fibers are superior to those of parental C312. which contain an average of 7.45% immature fibers.<br>
Fiber length. Three transgenic lines showed an average increase in Upper Half Mean length of 10% to attain average UHM of 1.14 inches. The three lines also have more uniform fiber length, with average Uniformity Index increased 4.1% to attain average UI of 87.2%. The three lines also have fewer short fibers, with average Short Fiber Content by HVf decreasing 2.6% to attain average SFC% of 4.9 %. In addition to data summarized in Tables 3 and 4, other AFIS parameters support increased fiber length in fibers of SPS transgenic plants. For the average of three transgenic lines, L(w) increases 7% to 1.06 inches. L(n) increases 9% to 0.96 inches, UQL (w) increases 6% to 1.19 inches, L5% (n) [in] increases 6% to 1.34 inches, and L2.5% (n) increases 5% to 1.46 inches. Similarly, AFIS showed that on average three transgenic lines had decreased short fiber content with SFC% (w) decreasing 1.0% to 3.1% and SFC% (n) decreasing 2.0%o to 10.6%). (These AFIS SFC% averages omit the values from one plant of line 40-4b because they were extreme outliers that greatly skewed the averages away from the values for the other four plants in the line.) Since AFIS beats the fibers before taking the<br><br>
measurement, these reduced SFC% values are good indications for improved utility of fibers from SPS transgenic plants in normal fiber processing.<br>
Improvements Under Diverse Environmental Conditions:<br>
Many fiber quality parameters were enhanced most for transgenic lines compared to parental C312 in the 30/15°C, 360 CO? ppm chamber, which was the only typical growing condition for cotton tested. However, fiber quality was also maintained or enhanced in transgenic plants growing in the other Phytotron chambers where temperature was varied from 30/15°C to 30/28°C and/or CO2 was varied from 360 ppm to 700 ppm. This is demonstrated by transgenic values and change from values for C312 of fiber quality data from the three transgenic lines growing in the other three chambers averaged together, excluding the 30/15°C, 360 ppm chamber that has been summarized independently. Over-expression of SPS maintains especially strong effects on Micronaire and average fiber length, L(n), with parallel consistent effects on Ul and SFC.<br>

Changes within each plant line are compared in average values for the quality parameters of Micronaire, UHM. UI, bundle strength, SFC%. UQL, L(n), IFC%, and maturity ratio when 30/15°C changed to 30/28°C (at 360 ppm C02) or 360 ppm C02 changed to 700 ppm CO2 (at 30/15°C). These calculations show that over-expression of SPS in transgenic lines promotes nearly maximum increases in fiber quality even at the most limiting 30/3 5°C. 360 ppm CO2 condition. In contrast, raising the minimum temperature or the CO? level substantially enhanced the Micronaire. UHM. UL and bundle strength of parental C312. Therefore, high fiber quality in SPS transgenic plants is more independent of environment.<br><br>
Example 4-    Summary of Results Demonstrating Increased Fiber Quality as Analyzed by Mantis Single Fiber Tests<br>
Cotton fibers with higher individual fiber strength are highly valued by the textile industry because they break less frequently during processing. Therefore, average fiber length can be maintained at a higher value throughout processing and higher quality fabrics can be manufactured with fewer defects. Increasing individual fiber strength is a major goal of the cotton industry.<br>
Mantis tests to determine single fiber strength were run on 100 fibers (two independent groups of 50 fibers each) from at least 4 plants from each plant line. Therefore, data in Table 5 are averages from at least 400 total fibers from each plant line.<br>

XX S.D: Standard deviation of the value<br>
XX S.D. %: % of the actual value represented by the standard deviation value<br>
Table 5 shows that single fiber strength as manifested in Tb: Elongation, and Work is consistently improved in all 3 transgenic lines compared to parental C312. On average in three transgenic lines, Tb is increased 24% to 6.56 g (Fig. 12), Elongation is increased 1.94% to 16.99% (Fig. 13). and Work is increased 29% to 17.10 jiJ (Fig. 14).<br><br>
(HVI did not show any increase in Elongation % of transgenic lines compared to parental C312 because the bundle-based HVI test will reflect only the elongation of the weakest fibers in the bundle.) Also, the standard deviation is a lower percentage of the transgenic single fiber strength values (averaging 14.6% lower for Work), demonstrating improved uniformity of single fiber strength. (Results of Mantis single fiber tests are expected to have high standard deviations).<br>
The scatter plots in Figs. 15-19 show correlations between single fiber strength parameters and Micronaire or Fiber Weight per Seed from the 30/15°C, 360 ppm C02 chamber. These illustrate positive correlations between Tb and WTork and Micronaire and Fiber Weight per Seed (Figs. 15-18). In contrast, no positive correlations were observed between Elongation and Micronaire (Fig. 19) or Fiber W'eight per Seed. Coefficients of determination show that 39 - 68% of the increases in Tb and Work are determined by increases in Micronaire and Fiber Weight per Seed. These positive correlations are primarily determined by distinctly separated groups of data points from the fibers of SPS transgenic plants. This point is emphasized by Table 6 showing coefficients of determination (R~) for each plant line considered separately. In contrast to the transgenic lines, parental C312 shows no substantial, positive R values. Therefore, over-expression of SPS causes increased values of Micronaire in transgenic fibers that are correlated with increased values of single fiber strength compared to parental C312.<br><br>
The substantial positive correlations with Tb and Work for both Micronaire (in 3 transgenic lines) and Fiber Weight per Seed (in 2 transgenic lines) support the fact that the increases in Fiber Weight per Seed and Micronaire are due to increased cellulose<br><br>
deposition in the fiber wall. Increase in Fiber Weight per Seed due to increased fiber number or increase in Micronaire due to increased fiber diameter would not result in an increase in single fiber strength. (Note that fiber number per seed cannot be determined, whereas the data allow one to predict by standard methods that fiber diameter has not changed.) However, the lack of complete correlation between single fiber strength values and Micronaire and Fiber Weight per Seed suggests that over-expression of SPS also contributes independently to increased single fiber strength, with 52 - 61% of the increased work values being explained by factors other than increased wall thickness. Also, the tendency for elevated Elongation in transgenic fibers is, as expected, independent of increased cellulose content of the fiber wall. (Elongation is highly dependent on the orientation of cellulose microfibrils within the fiber wall.) This point is emphasized by comparing line 13-3a with other transgenic lines.<br>
Example 5 - Photosynthetic Efficiency Under Cool Night Temperatures<br>
Over-expression of SPS in the leaves increases tolerance to cool nights by maintaining photosynthetic rates equal to warm-grown plants during the warm days following a 15°C night. In contrast, untransformed cotton shows reduced photosynthetic rate in the warm day following a cool night.<br>
Transgenic plants and parental C312 plants growing in the Phytotron were assayed for photosynthetic efficiency between 7-14 weeks of age. The first fully expanded leaf from the apex (judged by dark green color, shape, and size—the 3rd or 4th leaf down) was clamped and assayed for photosynthetic efficiency using a ADC LCA-4 analyzer under variable internal CO? concentrations. Plants growing at 30/28°C were assayed between 7-10 weeks of age and plants growing at 30/15°C were assayed between 10-14 weeks of age. In the earliest case, the plants would have been exposed to the experimental conditions for about 4 weeks. The plants were assayed at 30°C and at 4 h into the photoperiod. which also represented 3 h after complete rewarmmg from 28°C or 15°C to 30°C. Two plants were assayed for each line in each chamber.<br>
The graphs show photosynthetic rates over a range of internal CO? concentrations for parental C312 (Fig. 21) and two transgenic lines, 13-3a-l (Fig. 22) and 225-17a (Fig. 23). Normal atmospheric CO? concentration corresponds to interna! COo concentration of about 270 uX L* . Each graph is a compilation of four scatter plots, one for each plant of the line that was tested. The relative Dlacement of empty symbols<br><br>
(30/15°C condition) and filled symbols (30/28°C condition) should be compared between the lines. Comparing photosynthetic rate below internal CO2 concentrations of 500 |.LL L ', all four plants in the two transgenic lines tested maintained, when growing under a 30/15°C cycle, the same photosynthetic rate during the warm day as was observed for plants growing under 30/28°C cycling. In contrast, parental C312 showed the expected cool-night-induced reduction in photosynthetic rate, even though the assay was always done during the warm day. For three of the four transgenic plants tested, this difference was maintained at all internal CO2 concentrations tested.<br>
The variability in plant age at the time of assay between 30/15°C and 30/28°C chambers means that the comparisons between temperature cycles should be considered tentative. However, use of the same type of leaf from actively growing plants in each case supports their usefulness.<br>
It is not yet known why plants over-expressing SPS fail to acclimate photosynthesis in response to chilling as occurs in parental C312. Future analyses of leaf carbohydrate content will indicate whether more sucrose is synthesized during the warm day in transgenic plant leaves, which, coupled with higher rates of photosynthesis, might result in greater carbohydrate export from leaves to developing fibers during the day than occurs in parental C312. Such a mechanism could contribute to the increased seed and fiber yield and fiber quality of plants over-expressing SPS. It has also been observed that transgenic plants over-expressing SPS store less starch in their hypocotyls than parental C312. This indicates another source of extra carbohydrate that could help increase seed and fiber yield and fiber quality.<br>
Example 6 - Shift of Metabolic Flux Toward Cellulose in Sink Cells<br>
Tables 2 and 3 show that fiber properties depending on cellulose content including fiber weight/seed, micronaire. and fiber maturity ratio, increase in transgenic plants when SPS activity is elevated both in the leaves and the fibers. Therefore, with whole-plant analyses, one cannot judge whether these improvements are aided by enhanced export of sucrose from the leaves to the fibers or enhanced synthesis of sucrose in fiber (sink) cells, or both. Since cellulose synthesis has been proposed to use sucrose as an obligatory substrate from which UDP-glucose is generated by the enzyme sucrose synthase. SPS within sink cells can promote metabolic flux toward cellulose by one or both of two mechanisms. SPS could resynthesize sucrose within sink cells because<br><br>
translocated sucrose is cleaved before or soon after entering them, and/or SPS could reuse the fructose released by the activity of sucrose synthase to synthesize more sucrose (Fig. 2).<br>
Evidence that metabolic flux toward cellulose synthesis is enhanced in cellulose-storing sink cells (represented by cotton fibers) by over-expression of SPS was obtained from cotton ovules with attached developing fibers cultured in vitro. Cultured ovules/fibers are a non-photosynthetic system that uses external glucose in plant tissue culture medium as a carbon source to support metabolism required for seed and fiber maturation. Accepting that sucrose is an obligatory substrate for fiber cellulose synthesis, SPS synthesizes sucrose within tissue-cultured ovules/fibers supplied only with glucose. SPS could also reuse the fructose released by the activity of sucrose synthase to synthesize more sucrose. Positive effects of SPS over-expression observed in this system are necessarily independent of photosynthesis. However, the substrate supply in this tissue culture system is constant, implying that it is not possible to exclude enhanced supply of sucrose due to enhanced SPS expression in leaves or decreased starch storage in hypocotyls as also important in improvements observed in whole plants<br>
Plants yielding the results in Table 7 were flowering in the greenhouse between July and December. Ovules were dissected from flowers and cultured at 34°C on 1 DPA. The ovules of one flower were split between the 34°C and 15°C comparison in each case. Comparison within one flower better controlled the variability that was observed in the rates of cellulose synthesis on 21 DPA between cultures from different flowers of the same plant line. Each test at each temperature included 12-18 ovules split between three replicate dishes. Cultures were shifted from constant 34°C to a 34/15°C 12h/12h cycle on 18 DPA when secondary wall deposition had commenced. ' C-glucose was used to label developing ovules and fibers on 21 DPA at 34°C and 15°C. Therefore, the cultures had 3 days to adjust to exposure to 15°C. and on 21 DPA the 15°C assay was run 4 h after the shift to 15°C. Cultures of parental C312 treated identically were almost always assayed in parallel with transgenic plant lines.<br>
Rates of respiration (!4C02 evolution) and rates of crystalline cellulose synthesis (MC-cellulose remaining insoluble after boiling in acetic/nitric reagent) were determined at both temperatures. Metabolic activity of ovules (seeds) and cotton fibers is combined in the resulting data. However, previous work in which ovules and fibers were separated<br><br>
after the assay was completed demonstrated that under 34/15°C conditions, 82% of the total cellulose dpm (in ovules + fibers) was attributable to the fibers alone.<br>
From the   CO2 and ' C-cellulose data, four values were calculated for each plant line: (1) R% - a percentage derived from the 15°C/34°C ratio of dpm l4CC&gt;2 trapped on a KOH-soaked filter paper in the incubation chamber; (2) C% - a percentage derived from the 15°C/34°C ratio of dpm i4C-cellulose remaining insoluble after boiling in acetic/nitric reagent; (3) C/R15 - the ratio between dpm 14C-cellulose and dpm l4C02 at 15°C; and (4) C/R34 - the ratio between dpm MC-cellulose and dpm ,4C02 at 34°C. R% and C% describe the proportion of the 34°C rate of respiration or cellulose synthesis, respectively, that can be maintained at 15°C. C/Rj&gt; and C/R34 describe the proportion of metabolic flux directed toward cellulose synthesis vs. respiration at 15°C or 34°C. respectively. Results from parental C312 and 7 transgenic lines tested with good replication in parallel are shown in Table 7 with values considered higher than parental C312 shown in bold.<br><br>
* indicates lines shown in the Phytotron to have improved fiber quality.<br>
The data in Table 7 show that over-expression of SPS reduces R% in 6 of 7 transgenic lines tested in parallel compared to parental C312. This is paralleled by an increase in C% in 5 of 7 transgenic lines tested, meaning that most SPS transgenic lines<br><br>
are able to synthesize cellulose more efficiently at 15°C than parental C312. Correspondingly, the ratio of cellulose synthesis rate to respiration rate at 15°C (C/R15) increases in 5 of 7 transgenic lines tested. One transgenic line showed an increase in C/R34. Transgenic line 13-3a that showed improved fiber quality in the Phytotron did not show improvement in this assay except for reduction of R%. Perhaps this is because secondary wall production proceeds less vigorously in vitro than in planta.<br>
Example 7 -   Higher Rate of Weight Gain in Sink Cells (Cotton Fibers) During Primary and Secondary Wall Deposition<br>
The in vitro ovule/fiber culture system has provided direct evidence that over-expression of SPS in sink ceils can lead to higher rates of fiber weight gain at both warm and cool temperatures by mechanisms independent of photosynthesis.<br>
Ovules of transgenic and control C312 were cultured in vitro at constant 34°C or cycling 34/15°C from the beginning of culture. Ovules/fibers (8-10 per data point) were harvested from parallel cultures (containing equal representation of 5-8 flowers from at least 3 plants) at intervals during fiber maturation (12-45 DPA). Fibers were stripped from ovules, oven-dried, and weighed. Fiber weight was plotted against time and the slope of weight gain during the period of high-rate secondary wall cellulose synthesis was determined under both temperature regimes. A ratio for the 34/15°C:34°C slopes within one plant line was also calculated, which will normalize for any inherent differences in rates of fiber weight gain in cultures of particular lines. For most plant lines tested, several replications of the experiment were conducted at various times allowing average slopes to be compared. A second experiment during a second compressed time interval included 3 complete time-course replications of fiber weight gain in the transgenic plant lines grown in the Phytotron, plus line 38-4a-l. The results of this second experiment, which indicate the repeatability of this assay, are shown as separate italic entries in the table. Values substantially greater than are found in the C312 parental line are highlighted in bold in Table 8.<br><br><br>

Note that the slopes from the kanamycin-sensitive and kanamycin-resistant siblings of 40-4b-2 are almost identical, and the differences between these and slopes from the parental C312 cannot be related to expression of the foreign gene.<br>

Two of the transgenic lines (414-1 a and 619- la) had rates of fiber weight gain at 34°C higher than parental C312, and several more had higher rates than and the non-SPS-expressing transgenic line, 40-4b-2-KS. Four transgenic lines (13-3a, 58-3a, 414-la, and 619-la) had rates of fiber weight gain at 34/15°C higher than parental C312. Three transgenic lines (I3-3a-l, 40-6a-l = 40-17a-6, 58-3a) had a ratio for the 34/15°C:34°C slopes higher than parental C312 and the non-SPS-expressing transgenic line, 40-4b-2-KS. Lines 414-1 a and 619-la do not stand out in analysis of slope ratios because of greater slopes at both 34°C and 34/15°C, but these are promising lines for future fiber quality analysis. Some of the lines tested at the Phytotron and shown to have improved fiber quality are superior to parental C312 in this test. The lack of complete consistency may be due to the fact that secondary wall production proceeds less vigorously in vitro than in plant a.<br>
From replicated time-courses of fiber weight gain, absolute values of fiber dry weight were also compared at 15 DPA (end of primary wall deposition) and 30 DPA (after extensive secondary wall deposition) in the transgenic plant lines grown in the Phytotron, plus line 38-4a-l. Each data point is the average from three experiments, including fiber from a total of 24 - 30 ovules representing 15-24 flowers from 4-6 plants per line. The results are shown in Table 9.<br><br>
Tested at the Phytotron; showing improved fiber quality.<br><br>
At 15 DP A, four transgenic lines show consistently greater weight gain than parental C312 under 34/15°C, and three of the four transgenic lines show greater weight gain under constant 34°C. The ratio of 34/15°C to 34°C weights is greater in all four transgenic lines, demonstrating improved fiber production in SPS transgenic plants under adverse cool temperatures by mechanisms independent of photosynthesis. At 15 DPA, fiber dry weight is composed mostly of primary walls, and greater fiber weight could be due to greater fiber length or greater primary wall thickness, or both.<br>
At 30 DP A, one transgenic line shows greater fiber weight gain than parental C312 under 34/15°C. Two transgenic lines show greater ratio of 34/15°C to 34°C weights. Fiber dry weight at 30 DPA is largely cellulose. Therefore, SPS over-expression within transgenic fibers promotes cellulose deposition, including its deposition under adverse cool temperatures. The inconsistency of results for transgenic lines at 30 DPA is likely explained by the fact that secondary wall deposition in vitro is more hindered than fiber lengthening. However, all the transgenic lines tested in the Phytotron and showing improved fiber quality show some improvement in this in vitro test.<br>
Example 8 - Enhanced Stem Weight of Transgenic Cotton Plants<br>
The positive effects of SPS over-expression on cellulose synthesis in cotton fibers extends to other fibers. Fibers make up most of the weight of annual or perennial strong stems, such as are found in mature cotton plants. Therefore, the stem weight of cotton plants grown in the Phytotron and the Texas Tech greenhouse was determined (Table 10). The conditions of the Texas Tech greenhouse were most similar to the Phytotron 30/15°C, 360 ppm C02 chamber.<br><br><br>
In the Phytotron, time of stem weight determination varied somewhat between plant lines for the 30/28°C chambers because each plant was harvested shortly after all bolls on it had opened. For the 30/15°C condition, plant growth was terminated at the same time when some immature bolls remained on all plants. All plants were 6- 7 months old at time of harvest. In the Texas Tech greenhouse, parental and transgenic plants were randomized on two adjacent tables and grown for 30 weeks before simultaneous harvesting. Main stem diameter and height were also determined in the greenhouse plants.<br>
In the Phytotron. stem weight increased by 10% or more in transgenic plants compared to parental C312 in 11 of 15 cases (representing the matrix of plant lines x chambers tested). The increases are particularly pronounced and consistent across three chambers for line 40-6a-4, although there were few replicate plants in the Phytotron for this line. Therefore, line 40-6a-4-3 was tested at the next generation (T3) in the Texas Tech greenhouse with more replication in parallel with parental C312 and another transgenic line, 357-6a-l at T2. Line 40-6a-4-3 again showed average increased stem weight with a similar magnitude of change as observed in the Phytotron chambers at 30/15°C and both 360 and 700 ppm C02. In addition, line 40-6a-4-3 showed average<br><br>
increased stem height and stem diameter compared to parental C312 and the transgenic line 357-6a-l, which was smaller than C312. Therefore, transgenic lines do not all show increased stem weight, probably because of differences in tissue-specific gene expression. Considering the main plant stem, excluding branches that were also weighed, as a right cone with volume = 7tr2h/3, line 40-6a-4-3 would have increased volume of 1.31 times compared to parental C312. The similarity of this to the observed weight increase of 1.27 times suggests that much of the weight increase is associated with increased volume of the main stem containing abundant fibers. The 4% difference between the theoretical prediction and the observation could be due to different degrees of branching or changes in stem density that have not been determined.<br>
Example 9 -   Increased Stem Diameter in Multiple Lines of Transgenic Cotton<br>
In addition to line 40-6a, some stems appeared bigger than others among transgenic cotton plants growing in the greenhouse. However, these plants were of different ages. To try to quantitate this observation, electronic calipers were used to measure stem diameter approximately two inches above the soil line in all plants in the greenhouse on 9/23/98 (which did not include all the plants of interest implicated by previous studies). Date of planting was also recorded for each plant measured. By analyzing values for the Coker 312 parent and transgenic line 58-3a(2) (Tl individuals, number 1 -7) that had plants of several ages in the greenhouse, the following approximate values for rate of stem diameter increase per day were estimated. The rate decreases with time because, in the 2 gallon pots used for planting, stem diameter in parental C312 plants apparently slows or stops increasing at about 5 months.<br>
Plant Age	Rate of Stem Diameter Increase<br>
160-200 days	0.10 mm/day<br>
&gt;210 days	0.06 mm/day<br>
Of 12 independent transgenic lines analyzed (each with several replicate pots), six had average values greater than the standards established for parental C312 (or at the upper end of the range) (Table 11). Transgenic lines that did not show increased rates of stem diameter increase may express spinach SPS less strongly in their stems.<br><br><br>
Note that Table 10 confirms through a second experiment the increased rate of stem diameter increase for line 40-6a-4-3. Increased stem diameter depends on more cellulose-containing fiber within the stem. Larger stem diameter at the end of a growing period could be explained by faster rate of diameter increase or longer persistence of diameter increase in one growing season. Either case will result in more harvestable stem fiber.<br>
Example 10 - Enhanced Conversion of Atmospheric CO: into Harvestable Crops, Preferentially CclJulose-based Fiber<br>
As shown in Table 12. comparison of data between the 30/15°C Phytotron chambers with 360 and 700 ppm CO2 demonstrates that SPS transgenic plants convert normal levels of CO? more efficiently into cellulose-based cotton fiber. At normal levels of CO2, SPS transgenic plants are able to more nearly reach their maximum possible fiber production potential (as shown by comparative changes in Lint Fiber Weight per Seed) so that raising COi to 700 ppm increases their fiber wall thickness less than parental C312 (as shown by comparative changes in Micronaire). However, when stem weight is considered as an indication of production potential for all types of fiber, transgenic plants remain superior to parental C312 at 30/15°C even under elevated CCh. In contrast, raising CO: levels at 30/15°C tended to decrease seed weight in transgenics and parental<br><br>
C312 (although transgenic seed weight always remained higher than in parental C312— see Example 2).<br>
Therefore, over-expression of SPS has a preferential effect on cotton fiber production probably due to increasing sink demand of this cellulose-based sink. SPS over-expression in fiber can, as previously demonstrated, preferentially increase metabolic flux toward cellulose and fiber weight gain. Data supporting these conclusions are shown in Table 12, which shows the percentage change in values of various parameters when CCb was increased from 300 to 700 ppm under 30/15°C in the Phytotron.<br><br>
Fiber crops that over-express SPS can convert normal CCb more efficiently into economically valuable fiber. Such plants grown widely as crops should help to combat rising CO: levels in the atmosphere because they immobilize CO: into fiber cellulose with improved efficiency under normal CO: levels, and this efficiency of production is maintained (for cotton fiber) or enhanced (for stem fiber) under elevated CO2 levels.<br>
