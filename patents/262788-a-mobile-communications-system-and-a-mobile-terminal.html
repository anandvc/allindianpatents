				<td>Specification<br>
MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM AND MOBILE TERMINAL Field of the Invention [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communications system in which a base station carries out radio communications with a plurality of mobile terminals by controlling the transmission rates, the transmission powers (the permitted transmission powers and maximum permitted transmission powers) , the transmission timings, the available frequencies, and so on of the plurality of mobile terminals, by using a scheduler, and a mobile terminal which constructs the system. Background of the Invention [0002]<br>
In recent years, the mainstream of a data communication method which a mobile communications system uses has been changing from a circuit switching method to a packet communication method.<br>
While, in general, the packet communication method is based on a continuous connection, there is a limit to the available capacity of a battery which a mobile terminal in a mobile communications system can carry.<br>
Therefore, in a case in which the mobile communications system employs a packet communication method (a continuous connection), it is necessary to achieve low power consumption in a mobile terminal. [0003]<br>
As a standardization organization of mobile communications systems, the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) exists.<br><br>
Currently, in the 3GPP, a UTRAN system (Release7) and an Evolved RAN system (E-UTRAN, LTE: Long Term Evolution) which are mobile communications systems of the next version have been under debate, and reduction in the power consumption in the packet communication method has also been under debate on the spot.<br>
It has been determined in the debate that because, in a mobile terminal using the packet communication method, a case in which there exist no transmission data and no received data can occur even if a wireless section is being connected, a newly provision of a state of supporting low power consumption in a mobile terminal and an operation of supporting low power consumption in a mobile terminal has been determined. [0004]<br>
For an LTE system, a state 1 "Idle" in which a mobile terminal is during inactivity at an RRC level, and a state 2 "Active (in a broad sense) " in which a mobile terminal is during active are defined. Nonpatent reference 1 shown hereafter discloses introduction of a new state 2-A "Active (in a narrow sense) " and a state 2-B "DRX/DTX operation period during Active" into during "Active (in a broad sense)", as shown in Fig. 13.<br>
Furthermore, nonpatent reference 2 shown hereafter<br>
describes that it is possible to dispose a DRX/DTX period<br>
(DRX/DTX period) in RRC_Connected (corresponding to the state<br>
2 of Fig. 13) in order to achieve low power consumption in a<br>
mobile terminal.<br>
[0005]<br>
The state 1 of Fig. 13 is called "Idle", "LTE_Idle", "RRC_Idle", "NAS_Idle", or the like, and a mobile terminal placed in the state 1 of Fig. 13 performs a receiving operation<br><br>
in a DRX cycle which is set up by NAS (Non-Access Stratum) (i.e., in a cycle different from the DRX cycle of a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13)). More specifically, the mobile terminal performs a Paging operation.<br>
The state 2 of Fig. 13 is called "Active", "LTE_Active", "RRC_Active", "RRC_Connected", "Connected", "NAS_Active", or the like. [0006]<br>
The state 2-A of Fig . 13 is called "Active" , "MAC_Active" , or the like.<br>
The state 2-B of Fig. 13 is called "Dormant", "MAC_Dormant", "DRX/DTX period (DRX/DTX period)", "DRX/DTX period during Active", "DRX/DTX period during Connected", or the like, and, in this state, an operation for achieving low power consumption in a mobile terminal during Active is carried out (for example, a stop of transmission or reception of data (user data and control data) is performed temporarily). [0007]<br>
Nonpatent reference 3 shown hereafter discloses a<br>
technology of, during a DRX/DTX operation period during Active<br>
(the state 2-B of Fig. 13) , carrying out a process of signaling<br>
both a period during which a DRX operation is performed and a<br>
period during which a DTX operation is performed by using MAC<br>
(Medium Access Control) by a base station.<br>
Patent references 1 shown hereafter discloses a technology of switching a cycle in which a mobile terminal transmits a CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) to a base station between a high-speed one and a low-speed one according to whether or not transmission of downlink data has been performed, though the cycle differs from the DTX cycle in a DRX/DTX<br><br>
operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13). Thereby, effective use of the uplink radio resources is achieved. [0008]<br>
Nonpatent reference 4 shown hereafter discloses a technology of making a mobile terminal check to see whether there exist data destined for the mobile terminal itself in a DRX cycle during Active (the state 2 of Fig. 13) by using a downlink scheduling channel.<br>
Nonpatent reference 6 shown hereafter describes a notification method of notifying a DRX period.<br>
The notification method of notifying a DRX period will be explained with reference to Fig. 14.<br>
Information indicating a DRX period is included in control data (e.g., an L1/L2 control signal) which associates first-time transmission data (user data) from a base station.<br>
When the mobile terminal fails in reception of the first-time transmission data transmitted from the base station, the mobile terminal transmits a HARQ-compliant Nack signal (negative response signal) to the base station.<br>
When receiving the Nack signal transmitted from the mobile terminal, the base station retransmits the same data as the first-time transmission data to the mobile terminal. The information indicating a DRX period is not included in the control data which associates this retransmission.<br>
When succeeding in the reception of the retransmission<br>
data transmitted from the base station, the mobile terminal<br>
starts a timer A while transmitting a HARQ-compliant Ack signal<br>
(ACK signal) to the base station.<br>
i       When receiving the Ack signal transmitted from the mobile<br><br>
terminal, the base station starts a timer A.<br>
After the timers A are expired, the mobile terminal and the base station start their DRX operations. [0009]<br>
Nonpatent reference 8 shown hereafter discloses a DRX operation in a case in which two DRX cycles are set up.<br>
Nonpatent reference 5 shown hereafter discloses a technology of judging whether to carry out an operation with low power consumption according to mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) showing the capabilities of a mobile terminal, though the purpose of the technology differs from those disclosed in the above-mentioned nonpatent references 1 to 4 and the patent reference 1. [0010]<br>
Control signals which are used to enable communications between a mobile terminal and a base station via a radio link include an upper layer signal, such as an "L3 control signal" (a Layer3 control signaling or an L3 message) , and a signal which is called an "L1/L2 control signal" (a Layer1/Layer2 control signaling).<br>
An L3 control signal is typically notified from an upper layer, such as an RRC layer, at a time of initial transmission including a time of occurrence of a call connection (RRC Connect) , and is used to perform a setup of uplink or downlink 1 channels via the downlink or allocation of radio resources via the downlink.<br>
In contrast, an L1/L2 control signal is frequently<br>
exchanged between a mobile terminal and a base station via both<br>
the uplink and the downlink, and includes an uplink scheduling<br>
)  request signal which a mobile terminal outputs to make a request<br><br>
of a base station for allocation of the radio resources via the uplink. Also at a time when the radio resources are irregularly changed in response to a request to change the data size or a request for the quality of the communication path, the time including a time of occurrence of a call connection and a time of continuation, an L1/L2 control signal is used.<br>
An L1/L2 control signal includes an Ack signal/Nack signal which either a base station or a mobile terminal sends back to the party on the other end of the connection when receiving data via uplink or downlink to answer whether either the base station or the mobile terminal has received the data correctly, and a quality information CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) showing the quality of the received data or the quality of the communication path. [0011]<br>
Nonpatent reference 7 shown hereafter shows that, in an uplink reference signal (Reference Signal), two types of signals including a reference signal used for demodulation (Demodulation) and synchronous detection (Detection), and a reference signal (Sounding Reference Signal) used for measurement of the quality of an uplink channel exist. The Sounding Reference Signal (Sounding RS) is transmitted from a mobile terminal (UE) to a base station (eNB) in order for the base station to measure the communication quality of the uplink. [0012]<br>
The following nonpatent reference 9 discloses that only time division multiplexing (Time Division Multiplexing: TDM) is used as a method of transmitting data for a E-MBMS (Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service) and services other than the E-MBMS (non-MBMS and non-EMBMS). Units in which the time<br><br>
division is carried out is set to be subframes (Subframes).<br>
The E-MBMS is a multicast and broadcast type multimedia service.<br>
In this service, a large-volume broadcast content, such as a news content, a weather forecast content, or a mobile broadcast content, is transmitted to a plurality of mobile terminals. [0013]<br>
A base station maps E-MBMS data onto either a DL-SCH (Downlink Shared Channel) or an MCH (Multicast Channel), and then transmits the E-MBMS data to mobile terminals.<br>
Furthermore, LTE not only provides a broadcast type communication service (except the E-MBMS (non-MBMS) ) , but also provides a communication service to an individual mobile terminal among a plurality of mobile terminals. A communication service provided to an individual mobile terminal is called a Unicast service.<br>
Nonpatent reference 10 shown hereafter discloses that either only one leading symbol or only two leading symbols included in a subframe which is allocated to the E-MBMS through time division multiplexing is used by a Unicast service. [0014]<br>
However, the nonpatent references 1 to 3 and the patent reference 1 do not disclose any concrete method of effectively achieving low power consumption in a mobile terminal in a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (a state 2-B as shown in Fig. 13).<br>
More specifically, the nonpatent references 1 and 2 disclose newly establishment of a state (the state 2-B shown in Fig. 13) for supporting low power consumption in a mobile terminal, but does not disclose any method of efficiently<br><br>
achieving low power consumption in a mobile terminal in a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B shown in Fig. 13) which is newly established. [0015]<br>
Furthermore, the nonpatent reference 3 discloses the technology of signaling information indicating a period during which a DRX operation is performed and a period during which a DTX operation is performed in a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B shown in Fig. 13) by using the MAC of a base station, as mentioned above, but does not disclose any method of setting up DRX/DTX cycles in order to efficiently achieve low power consumption in a mobile terminal.<br>
In addition, the notification method of notifying a DRX period disclosed by the nonpatent reference 6 differs from a notification method of notifying a DRX period which will be disclosed by the present invention.<br>
Furthermore, a problem with the method disclosed by the nonpatent reference 6 is that a base station has to carry out scheduling in order to determine a timing (i.e., a DRX period end timing) at which the base station starts a DRX operation every time when the base station receives a Nack signal from a mobile terminal ("a time (i) ", "a time (ii)", and "a time (iii) " shown in Fig. 14), and therefore the load of the scheduling becomes heavy. Thus, the nonpatent reference 6 is not aimed at notifying the information indicating a DRX period while reducing the scheduling load of the base station, and does not offer any suggestion about this purpose. [0016]<br>
In a DRX operation in the case in which two DRX cycles are set up, which is disclosed by the nonpatent reference 8,<br><br>
any application of HARQ is not taken into consideration at all.<br>
Therefore, a problem with the method of notifying the DRX cycle information by using an L1/L2 control signal together with the first-time transmission data, notifying the DRX cycle information at a time of a setup of a radio bearer, or determining the DRX cycle information in advance, in a conventional way is that when retransmission based on HARQ exceeds this DRX cycle, it becomes impossible to make a transition to a DRX operation. [0017]<br>
The nonpatent reference 9 and 10 describe nothing about a DRX operation (a DRX operation during Active).<br>
Furthermore, these references also disclose nothing about what kind of information is notified using a symbol available for a Unicast service in a subframe allocated to the E-MBMS. [0018]<br>
The patent reference 1 discloses the technology of switching a cycle in which a mobile terminal transmits a CQI to a base station between a high-speed one and a low-speed one according to whether or not transmission of downlink data has been performed, but discloses nothing about a signaling between the mobile terminal and the base station for the switching of the cycle between a high-speed one and a low-speed one. The technology disclosed by the patent reference 1 is the one in i which no operation with low power consumption is introduced into the operation of a mobile terminal during Active (the state 2 as shown in Fig. 13). [0019]<br>
Next, the nonpatent reference 4 discloses the technology )  of making a mobile terminal check to see whether there exist<br><br>
data destined for the mobile terminal itself in a DRX cycle during Active (the state 2 as shown in Fig. 13) by using a downlink scheduling channel, as mentioned above. In other words, in a mobile terminal during a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B as shown in Fig. 13), a period during which the mobile terminal is unable to receive any downlink data from a base station exists.<br>
Therefore, even when a base station desires to transmit downlink data to a mobile terminal during a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B as shown in Fig. 13), the base station cannot transmit any data to the mobile terminal until a preset cycle has elapsed.<br>
Therefore, the throughput of the mobile terminal decreases, and, even if it is preferable to give a higher priority to the throughput of the mobile terminal than to achievement of low power consumption in the mobile terminal, any improvement in the throughput cannot be achieved. [0020]<br>
Nonpatent reference 5 shown hereafter discloses a technology of judging whether a mobile terminal should carry out an operation with low power consumption according to the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) in order to enable application to a case in which a higher priority should be given to the throughput of the mobile terminal.<br>
However, in the current technology, the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) is a value specific to each mobile terminal.<br>
The  mobile  terminal  capability  information  (UE<br>
Capabilities) is notified from the mobile terminal to the<br>
i  network at a time of an RRC (Radio Resource Control) connection<br><br>
(e.g., at a time of attach, at a time of calling, and at a time of location registration).<br>
Therefore, in accordance with the current technology, because a parameter showing which achievement of low power consumption in a mobile terminal or an improvement in the throughput of the mobile terminal should be given a higher priority is specific to each mobile terminal, and the timing at which a notification of the parameter can be made is restricted, it is difficult to effectively achieve low power consumption in the mobile terminal during a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (a state 2-B as shown in Fig. 13).

Because conventional mobile communications systems are constructed as mentioned above, they make it possible to introduce the state 2-B, i.e., a "DRX/DTX operation period<br><br>
during Active" into the state 2, in which the system is operating at an RRC level, i.e., an "Active (in a broad sense) . " A problem is, however, that neither a method of efficiently achieving low power consumption in a mobile terminal nor a method of setting up DRX/DTX cycles is defined, and therefore low power consumption cannot be necessarily achieved efficiently in a mobile terminal. [0023]<br>
The present invention is made in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, and it is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a mobile communications system which can achieve low power consumption in a mobile terminal efficiently, and a mobile terminal which can achieve low power consumption.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention [0024]<br>
In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a mobile communications system in which a mobile terminal judges whether or not the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a temporary data transmission stop period during which the mobile terminal temporarily stops transmission of data, and, when the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to the temporary transmission stop period, the mobile terminal temporarily stops supply of electric power to data transmission processing units and data reception processing units of the mobile terminal if the base station judges that the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a temporary reception stop period during which the mobile terminal temporarily stops reception of data. [0025]<br><br>
As a result, there is provided an advantage of being able to efficiently achieve low power consumption in the mobile terminal.<br>

Preferred Embodiments of the Invention [0027]<br>
Hereafter, in order to explain this invention in greater detail, the preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
An LTE system will be explained hereafter. The present invention can be applied to a mobile communications system (e.g., a UTRAN system) in which uplink and downlink schedulers control and specify a transmission rate, transmission power (permitted transmission power and maximum permitted transmission power) , )  a transmission timing, an available frequency, the width of the<br><br>
available frequency, and so on for each mobile terminal. Embodiment 1.<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram showing a mobile communications system in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention.<br>
The mobile communications system of Fig. 1 is an LTE system, and an uplink scheduler and a downlink scheduler of a base station controls the transmission rate, the transmission power (the permitted transmission power and the maximum permitted transmission power), the transmission timing, the available frequency, the width of the available frequency, and so on of each of a plurality of mobile terminals.<br>
Transport channels (Transport Channels) via which a mobile terminal and a base station communicate with each other in the mobile communications system of Fig. 1 will be further explained. Although it can be considered that the names and definitions of the transport channels will be changed from now on because the transport channels have been under debate, it cannot be overemphasized that the present invention can be applied to even a case in which the names and definitions of the transport channels are changed. [0028]<br>
In accordance with the present invention, a state 2-B of Fig. 13 is referred to as "DRX/DTX operation period during Active", though a time period during which a DRX operation period during Active and a DTX operation period during Active overlap each other will be explained as a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13).<br>
Furthermore, the DRX operation period during Active will<br>
be explained as a time period during which a receiving operation<br>
I  during a certain time period and an operation of not carrying<br><br>
out any reception during a certain time period are repeated in a DRX cycle during Active (refer to Fig. 15) . There also exists a DRX operation period during Active whose number of repetitions in the DRX cycle is only one.<br>
A time period during which no reception is carried out, the time period falling within the DRX operation period during Active, will be explained as a DRX period (DRX Period) or a DRX interval (DRX Interval) (refer to Fig. 15) .<br>
Furthermore, a portion which falls within the DRX operation period during Active, but excludes the DRX period will be explained as Active within the DRX operation period (refer to Fig. 15).<br>
As examples of the receiving operation which the mobile terminal 3 carries out in the DRX cycle during Active within the DRX operation period, the following receiving operations (1) to (8) can be considered.<br>
(1)	The mobile terminal 3's data receiving operation of checking to see whether there exist data addressed thereto by using a downlink scheduling channel;<br>
(2)	A monitor operation of monitoring a downlink L1/L2 control signal;<br>
(3)	A measurement operation (measurement of neighboring cells, measurement of a self-cell, etc.)<br>
(4)	A receiving operation of receiving user data (Traffic data);<br>
(5)	A receiving operation of receiving uplink timing<br>
information (Timing information and Timing Advance (TA));<br>
(6)	A receiving operation of receiving a downlink<br>
reference signal;<br>
(7)	A receiving operation of receiving a HARQ-compliant<br><br>
Ack signal/Nack signal which is a response to uplink data; and (8) A combination of the above-mentioned operations (1) to (7).<br>
In (8) , the combination of the operations (l) to (7) can be continuous or discontinuous with respect to time. [0029]<br>
Hereafter, HARQ (Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request) will be explained.<br>
A case in which HARQ is applied to transmission data from a base station to a mobile terminal will be explained.<br>
When receiving data from a base station, a mobile terminal performs an error detection process on the data. When not detecting any error through the above-mentioned error detection process, the mobile terminal transmits an Ack signal, as a response signal, to the base station, whereas when detecting an error through the above-mentioned error detection process, the mobile terminal transmits a Nack signal, as a response signal, to the base station.<br>
When receiving the Ack signal from the mobile terminal, the base station transmits new data to the mobile terminal, whereas when receiving the Nack signal from the mobile terminal, the base station retransmits the same data to the mobile terminal.<br>
It is possible to apply HARQ to a case of transmission data from a mobile terminal to a base station, like in the above-mentioned case. [0030]<br>
Furthermore, a DTX operation period during Active will<br>
be explained as a time period during which a transmitting<br>
)  operation during a certain time period and an operation of not<br><br>
carrying out any transmission during a certain time period are repeated in a DTX cycle during Active (refer to Fig. 15) . There also exists a DTX operation period during Active whose number of repetitions in the DTX cycle is only one. A time period during which no transmission is carried out, the time period falling within the DTX operation period during Active, will be explained as a DTX period (DTX Period) or a DTX interval (DTX Interval) (refer to Fig. 15).<br>
Furthermore,  a portion which falls within the DTX operation period during Active, but excludes the DTX period will be explained as Active within the DTX operation period (refer to Fig. 15). [0031]<br>
As examples of the transmitting operation which the mobile terminal 3 carries out in the DTX cycle during Active within the DTX operation period, the following transmitting operations (1) to (9) can be considered.<br>
(1)	A transmitting operation of transmitting information which is used for downlink scheduling (for example, CQI);<br>
(2)	A transmitting operation of transmitting a reference signal which is used for demodulation (Demodulation) and synchronous detection (Detection);<br>
(3)	A transmitting operation of transmitting a reference signal (Sounding Reference Signal) intended for measurement of uplink channel quality;<br>
(4)	A transmitting operation of transmitting an uplink<br>
scheduling request;<br>
(5)	A transmitting operation of transmitting user data (Traffic data);<br>
(6)	A transmitting operation intended for uplink timing<br><br>
measurement by a base station (for example, transmission of a Sounding Reference Signal, CQI, RACH, or the like can be considered ) ;<br>
(7)	A transmitting operation of transmitting a<br>
HARQ-compliant Ack signal/Nack signal which is a response to<br>
downlink data;<br>
(8)	A transmitting operation of transmitting an L1/L2 control signal; and<br>
(9)	A combination of the above-mentioned operations (1) to (8) .<br>
In (9), the combination of the operations (1) to (8) can be continuous or discontinuous with respect to time. [0032]<br>
The present invention can also be applied to a case in which the definitions of the terms previously explained are changed.<br>
For example, it can be considered that (3) when a reference signal (Sounding Reference Signal) intended for measurement of uplink channel quality is transmitted or (6) when a Sounding Reference Signal is transmitted as a transmitting operation for enabling uplink timing measurement by a base station, as the mobile terminal 3's transmitting operation of carrying out transmission in the DTX cycle, the naming is changed from the DTX cycle to a Sounding Reference Signal transmission cycle. The present invention can also be applied to such a case.<br>
Furthermore, for example, it can be considered that (1) when information (e.g., CQI) which is used for downlink scheduling is transmitted or (6) when CQI is transmitted as a transmitting operation for enabling uplink timing measurement by a base station, as the mobile terminal 3's transmitting<br><br>
operation of carrying out transmission in the DTX cycle, the naming is changed from the DTX cycle to a CQI transmission cycle. The present invention can also be applied to such a case. [0033]<br>
Furthermore, the present invention can also be applied to a case in which the DRX operation period during Active, the DTX operation period during Active, or a period during which either the DRX operation period during Active or the DTX operation period is the state 2-B of Fig. 13.<br>
Although the number of states and the definition of each of the states can be changed according to future debate, it cannot be overemphasized that the present invention can also be applied to a case in which the number of states and the definition of each of the states are changed. [0034]<br>

3	which belongs thereto.<br>
A DL-SCH (Downlink Shared Channel) is a shared channel (Shared Channel) via which a base station 2 transmits control data and user data to a mobile terminal 3 which belongs thereto. [0036]<br>
A PCH (Paging Channel) is a channel via which a base<br>
station 2 supports discontinuous reception (intermittent<br>
reception) which a mobile terminal 3 performs in a DRX cycle<br>
(i.e., a cycle different from the DRX cycle of the DRX/DTX<br>
i  operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13)) of<br><br>
the mobile terminal 3 which is set up via a network.<br>
A UL-SCH (Uplink Shared Channel) is a shared channel via which a mobile terminal 3 transmits control data and user data to a base station 2.<br>

construct the mobile terminal 3 . For example, when the judgment<br>
result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal<br>
)  is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during<br><br>
Active, and the protocol processing unit 11 acquires the judgment result of the base station 2 showing that the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active, the control unit 23 carries out a process of temporarily stopping the supply of electric power to data transmission processing units (e.g., the encoder unit 14 and the modulating unit 15) and data receiving processing units (e.g., the demodulating unit 17 and the decoder unit 18) according to both the DTX cycle information stored in the DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle information stored in the DRX cycle storage unit 22.<br>

Fig. 4 is a sequence diagram showing the description of processing carried out by the mobile communications system in accordance with Embodiment 1 of the present invention. [0052] i       Next, the operation of the mobile communications system will be explained.<br>
When a mobile terminal 3 is placed in the state 2 "Active<br>
(in a broad sense) " of Fig. 13, the DTX judging unit 19 of the<br>
mobile terminal 3 judges whether or not the mobile station is<br>
)  able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active<br><br>
(step ST1).<br>
More specifically, the DTX judging unit 19 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able to perform a DTX operation during Active. [0053]<br>
As an example of the DTX operation, there can be provided an operation of not transmitting (DTX: Discontinuous Transmission) information (e.g., CQI) which the mobile terminal 3 uses for uplink user data or downlink scheduling, a pilot signal (a signal which is used for synchronous detection compensation of uplink data, phase compensation of uplink data, etc.), and a reference signal (Sounding Reference Signal) intended for measurement of uplink channel quality.<br>
As an alternative, the DTX operation can be an operation associated with one of the following periods (1) to (8):<br>
(1)	a period during which no information used for downlink scheduling (e.g., CQI) is transmitted;<br>
(2)	a period during which no pilot signal is transmitted; (3) a period during which no reference signal (Sounding Reference Signal) intended for measurement of uplink channel quality is transmitted;<br>
(4)	a period during which no uplink scheduling request<br>
is transmitted;<br>
(5)	a period during which no uplink user data are<br>
i  transmitted;<br>
(6)	a period during which no transmission for enabling<br>
measurement of an uplink timing by a base station is carried<br>
out;<br>
(7)	a period during which no HARQ-compliant Ack<br>
)  signal/Nack signal for downlink data is transmitted; and<br><br>
(8) a period during which no L1/L2 control signal is transmitted,  or can be an operation associated with a combination of these periods. [0054]<br>
The DTX judging unit 19 carries out the judgment of whether or not the mobile terminal is able to perform a DTX operation by, for example, checking to see whether there exist data in the transmission data buffer unit 13.<br>
Concretely, when no data exist in the transmission data buffer unit 13, the DTX judging unit 19 determines that the mobile terminal can perform the DTX operation, whereas when data exist in the transmission data buffer unit 13, the DTX judging unit 19 determines that the mobile terminal cannot perform the DTX operation.<br>
The DTX judging unit 19 outputs the result of the determination of whether the mobile terminal can perform the DTX operation to the protocol processing unit 11. [0055]<br>
When the judgment result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal can perform a DTX operation, i.e. , when the judgment result shows that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, the Sleep request signal generating unit 20 of the mobile terminal 3 generates a Sleep request signal according to an instruction &gt; from the protocol processing unit 11, and outputs, as control data, the Sleep request signal to the transmission data buffer unit 13. [0056]<br>
In this case, the Sleep request signal is a signal having ]  all of the following meanings (1) to (5):<br><br>
(1)	the mobile terminal 3 starts a DTX operation period<br>
during Active;<br>
(2)	there exist no data to be transmitted in the<br>
transmission data buffer unit 13 of the mobile terminal 3 or<br>
there exist no data to be transmitted immediately;<br>
(3)	the mobile terminal makes a request of the base station<br>
2 to synchronize the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle in the state<br>
2	"Active (in a broad sense)" of Fig. 13;<br>
(4)	the mobile terminal makes a request to make a<br>
transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the<br>
state 2-B of Fig. 13); and<br>
(5)	the mobile terminal makes a request to start a DRX<br>
operation period during Active, one of the meanings (1) to (5) ,<br>
or a combination of some of the meanings.<br>
As an alternative, the Sleep request signal can be a signal which is notified and transmitted to the base station 2, the signal having all of the above-mentioned (1) to (5) , a combination of some of the meanings, or either one of the meanings (1) to (5). [0057]<br>
When the Sleep request signal generating unit 20 stores the control data (the Sleep request signal) in the transmission data buffer unit 13, the encoder unit 14 of the mobile terminal<br>
3	carries out an encoding process of encoding the control data<br>
(the Sleep request signal) stored in the transmission data<br>
buffer unit 13.<br>
After the encoder unit 14 carries out the encoding process, the modulating unit 15 of the mobile terminal 3 modulates the control data (the Sleep request signal) on which the encoding process has been performed, and then outputs the modulated<br><br>
control data (the Sleep request signal) to the antenna 16. [0058]<br>
The antenna 16 of the mobile terminal 3 transmits, as a radio signal, the signal which the modulating unit 15 has modulated with the control data (the Sleep request signal) to the base station 2 (step ST2).<br>
The example in which the mobile terminal 3 transmits, as a radio signal, the control data (the Sleep request signal) to the base station 2 is shown, though the mobile terminal can alternatively use, as the method of notifying the Sleep request signal, a method of mapping the Sleep request signal onto a physical channel, a method of mapping the Sleep request signal onto a MAC header or the like as a MAC signaling, or the like. [0059]<br>
When receiving the radio signal transmitted thereto from the mobile terminal 3, the antenna 37 of the base station 2 outputs the radio signal to the demodulating unit 38 (step ST3) .<br>
When receiving the radio signal from the antenna 37, the<br>
demodulating unit 3 8 of the base station 2 performs a<br>
i  demodulation process on the radio signal and then outputs the<br>
demodulated control data (the Sleep request signal) to the<br>
decoder unit 39.<br>
The decoder unit 3 9 of the base station 2 performs a decoding process on the control data (the Sleep request signal) 5 which are demodulated by the demodulating unit 38, and outputs the decoded control data (the Sleep request signal) to both the protocol processing unit 33 and the Sleep request signal judging unit 40. [0060]<br>
When receiving the control data from the decoder unit 39,<br><br>
the Sleep request signal judging unit 40 of the base station<br>
2	judges whether or not a Sleep request signal is included in<br>
the control data and then outputs the result of the judgment<br>
to the protocol processing unit 33.<br>
When receiving the judgment result indicating that a Sleep request signal is included in the control data from the Sleep request signal judging unit 40, the protocol processing unit 3 3 of the base station 2 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is performing a DRX operation currently (step ST4) , and, when the mobile terminal 3 is performing a DRX operation currently, shifts to a process of step ST6 . As an alternative, the protocol processing unit 33, in step ST4, can judge whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is staying during a DRX operation period.  The process of step ST4 is optional and is not an indispensable process. [0061]<br>
When the mobile terminal 3 is not performing a DRX operation currently, the protocol processing unit 3 3 of the base station 2 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able i to perform a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) (step ST5) . In this example, the protocol processing unit 3 3 performs the judging process. As an alternative, either the downlink scheduler unit 42 or the uplink scheduler unit 43 can perform the judging process. The protocol processing unit 33, in step ST5, can alternatively judge whether or not the mobile terminal<br>
3	is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period.<br>
[0062]<br>
A DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) means that the mobile terminal 3 does not perform any reception of control data and user data during a certain time period.<br><br>
More particularly, a DRX operation during Active means that the mobile terminal receives a monitor signal which is specified by a specified DRX cycle, and performs a receiving operation succeedingly when there exist data destined for the mobile station itself, whereas when there exist no data destined for the mobile station itself, the mobile terminal stops the reception of the specified monitor signal.<br>
It can also be considered that using a specified timer, the mobile terminal restores from an operation during a DRX operation period during Active (in a broad sense) to a general receiving operation.<br>
The details of the description of the process of step ST5 by the protocol processing unit 33 will be mentioned below with reference to a flow chart of Fig. 5.<br>
When the protocol processing unit 33, in this step ST5, judges that the mobile terminal cannot perform a DRX operation, the protocol processing unit 33 can repeat the judgment of step ST5 at certain time intervals by using a timer or the like. [0063]<br>
When judging that the mobile terminal 3 can perform a DRX<br>
operation during Active (in a broad sense), the protocol<br>
processing unit 3 3 of the base station 2 changes the state of<br>
the base station 2 to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active<br>
(the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST6).<br>
When the protocol processing unit 33 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 can perform the DRX operation during Active (broad sense) in the above-mentioned way, i.e., when the protocol processing unit 33 judges whether or not the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period )  during Active, the protocol processing unit 33 outputs, as<br><br>
control data, the result of the judgment to the transmission data buffer unit 34. [0064]<br>
When the protocol processing unit 3 3 stores the control data (the judgment result) in the transmission data buffer unit 34, the encoder unit 35 of the base station 2 carries out an encoding process of encoding the control data (the judgment result) stored in the transmission data buffer unit 34.<br>
After the encoder unit 35 performs the encoding process, the modulating unit 36 of the base station 2 modulates the control data (the judgment result) on which the encoding process has been performed, and outputs the modulated control data (the judgment result) to the antenna 37. [0065]<br>
The antenna 37 of the base station 2 transmits, as a radio signal (a judgment result signal (information) , a transition notification signal (information), or a shift notification signal (information) ) , the signal which the modulating unit 36 has modulated with the control data (the judgment result) to . the mobile terminal 3 (step ST7).<br>
In this example, after processing step ST6, the base<br>
station processes step ST7, as previously mentioned, though the<br>
base station can alternatively process step ST7 at the same time<br>
when the base station processes step ST6, or can process step<br>
i  ST7 before processing step ST6.<br>
[0066]<br>
Furthermore,  in this example,  the base station 2<br>
transmits the control data (the judgment result), as a radio<br>
signal, to the mobile terminal 3, as previously mentioned,<br>
)  though the base station can alternatively use, as the method<br><br>
of notifying the judgment result, a method of mapping the judgment result onto a physical channel, a method of mapping the judgment result onto a MAC header or the like as a MAC signaling, or the like. [0067]<br>
In the process of step ST2, when the Sleep request signal is transmitted by using a channel (a transport channel or a physical channel) in which a response signal (an ACK signal/NACK signal) from the base station 2 to the mobile terminal 3 exists, i.e., when the Sleep request signal is transmitted from the mobile terminal 3 to the base station 2 by using a channel (a transport channel or a physical channel) which is supported by high-speed retransmission control with HARQ technique, the response signal (the ACK signal/NACK signal) can be transmitted i  together with the control data (the judgment result).<br>
This case has an advantage of eliminating the necessity to perform further downlink scheduling and being able to notify the control data (the judgment result) with a shorter delay (Delay) as compared with the case in which the control data (the judgment result) are transmitted by using another channel (e.g., a DL-SCH). [0068]<br>
When receiving the radio signal transmitted thereto from the base station 2, the antenna 16 of the mobile terminal 3 outputs the radio signal to the demodulating unit 17 (step ST8) .<br>
When receiving the radio signal from the antenna 16, the demodulating unit 17 of the mobile terminal 3 performs a demodulation process on the radio signal, and then outputs the control data (the judgment result) which the demodulating unit has obtained by demodulating the radio signal to the decoder<br><br>
unit 18.<br>
The decoder unit 18 of the mobile terminal 3 performs a decoding process on the control data (the judgment result) which the demodulating unit 17 has obtained by demodulating the radio signal, and outputs the decoded control data (the judgment result) to the protocol processing unit 11. [0069]<br>
The control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 judges whether to cause the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST9).<br>
When, in the process of step ST1, the judgment result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, and the protocol processing unit 11 acquires the control data (the judgment result) of the base station 2 indicating that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active, the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 determines to cause the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make I a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) , and then causes the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST10). [0070]<br>
After the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 causes the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) , the control unit 23 causes the mobile terminal to perform a DRX operation and a DTX operation (step ST11).<br>
More specifically, the control unit 23 temporarily stops<br><br>
the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units (e.g. , the encoder unit 14 and the modulating unit 15) in the cycle indicated by the DTX cycle information stored in the DTX cycle storage unit 21.<br>
Furthermore, the control unit 23 temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data reception processing units (e.g. , the demodulating unit 17 and the decoder unit 18) in the cycle indicated by the DRX cycle information stored in the DRX cycle storage unit 22.<br>
As an alternative, during a period during which the period during which the supply of the electric power can be stopped temporarily according to the DTX cycle information and the period during which the supply of the electric power can be stopped temporarily according to the DRX cycle information overlap each other, the control unit temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units and the data reception processing units.<br>
In this embodiment, although the example in which the control unit 23 temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the encoder unit 14, the modulating unit 15, the demodulating unit 17, and the decoder unit 18 is explained, the targets for which the supply of the electric power is stopped are only an example. For example, the supply of the electric power to the protocol processing unit 11, the application unit 12, the transmission data buffer unit 13, the DTX judging unit 19, the Sleep request signal generating unit 20, the DTX cycle storage unit 21, the DRX cycle storage unit 22, and so on can be stopped temporarily. [0071]<br>
If, in the process of step ST1, the protocol processing<br><br>
unit 11 acquires the control data (the judgment result) of the base station 2 indicating that the mobile terminal cannot make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active (or the protocol processing unit does not acquire the judgment result indicating that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active) even if the judgment result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 performs only a DTX operation without causing the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST12).<br>
More specifically, the control unit 23 does not stop the supply of the electric power to the data reception processing units (e.g. , the demodulating unit 17 and the decoder unit 18) , but temporarily stops the supply of electric power to the data transmission processing units (e.g., the encoder unit 14 and the modulating unit 15) in the cycle indicated by the DTX cycle information stored in the DTX cycle storage unit 21.<br>
As an alternative, because the control unit 23 cannot temporarily stop the supply of the electric power to the reception processing units, the control unit 23 does not have to perform the process of temporarily stopping the supply of the electric power to the transmission processing units. [0072]<br>
Hereafter, the description of the process of step ST5 carried out by the protocol processing unit 33 will be explained in detail.<br>
Fig. 5 is a flow chart showing the description of the process of step ST5 carried out by the protocol processing unit<br><br>
The protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 checks to see whether or not waiting data to be transmitted to a mobile terminal 3 which belongs thereto are stored in the transmission data buffer unit 34 (step ST21).<br>
In this example, the protocol processing unit 33 checks to see whether there exist data to be transmitted, as mentioned above, though the downlink scheduler unit 42 or the uplink scheduler unit 43 can alternatively check to see whether there exist data to be transmitted via the protocol processing unit 33, or can directly check to see whether there exist data to be transmitted in the transmission data buffer unit 34. [0073]<br>
The protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 also checks the QoS of a service stored in the QoS storage unit 41, i.e., the QoS of the service which a mobile terminal 3 which has transmitted a "Sleep request signal" to the base station 2 receives and which the base station 2 transmits (step ST22) .<br>
In this example, the protocol processing unit 33 checks i the QoS of the service, as previously mentioned, though the downlink scheduler unit 42 or the uplink scheduler unit 43 can alternatively check the QoS of the service via the protocol processing unit 33, or can directly check the QoS of the service stored in the QoS storage unit 41. [0074]<br>
The protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 further checks the information (e.g., CQI) which is used for the downlink scheduling of the mobile terminal 3 which belongs thereto which the downlink scheduler unit 42 grasps (step ST23) .<br>
In this example, the protocol processing unit 33 checks<br><br>
the information which is used for the downlink scheduling of the mobile terminal 3, as previously mentioned, though the uplink scheduler unit 43 can alternatively check the information which is used for the downlink scheduling via the protocol processing unit 33, or can directly check the information which is used for the downlink scheduling which the downlink scheduler unit 42 grasps. [0075]<br>
The protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 also checks the load of the scheduling on the downlink scheduler unit 42 (step ST24).<br>
In this example, the protocol processing unit 33 checks the load on the downlink scheduler unit 42, as previously mentioned, though the uplink scheduler unit 43 can alternatively check the load on the downlink scheduler unit 42 via the protocol processing unit 33, or can directly check the load on the downlink scheduler unit 42.<br>
The processes of steps ST21 to ST24 can be performed simultaneously, or can be performed in an arbitrary order. Furthermore, all the processes do not have to be performed. [0076]<br>
The protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 in question is able to perform a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) on :he basis of the pieces of information checked in steps ST21 :o ST24 (step ST25).<br>
Hereafter, an example of the judging process of step ST25 performed by the protocol processing unit 33 will be explained. [0077]<br>
When, in step ST21, determining that waiting data to be<br><br>
transmitted to a mobile terminal 3 which has transmitted a "Sleep request signal" to the base station are stored in the transmission data buffer unit 34, the protocol processing unit 33 determines that the mobile terminal cannot carry out a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense).<br>
This is because if the protocol processing unit 33 determines that the mobile terminal 3 can carry out a DRX operation during Active when waiting data to be transmitted to the mobile terminal 3 which has transmitted a "Sleep request signal" to the base station are stored in the transmission data buffer unit 34, the mobile terminal 3 in question is unable to perform an operation of receiving the data stored in the transmission data buffer unit 34 during a DRX operation period. [0078]<br>
Furthermore, when the QoS of the service stored in the QoS storage unit 41, which is checked in step ST22, i.e., the QoS of the service which the mobile terminal 3 which has transmitted a "Sleep request signal" to the base station receives and which the base station 2 transmits requires a high degree of real time nature, the protocol processing unit 33 determines that the mobile terminal cannot carry out a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense).<br>
This is because if the protocol processing unit 33 determines that the mobile terminal can carry out a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) when the QoS of the service requires a high degree of real time nature, even when, during a DRX operation period, for example, user data which require a high degree of real time nature are transmitted from a base station control apparatus, the base station cannot transmit the user data to the mobile terminal 3 and therefore<br><br>
cannot satisfy the QoS which is requested. [0079]<br>
Furthermore, when the information used for the downlink scheduling (e.g., CQI) of the mobile terminal 3 which belongs thereto, which was checked in step ST23, shows bad quality, the protocol processing unit 33 determines that the mobile terminal 3 in question can carry out a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) even if there exist waiting data to be transmitted to the mobile terminal 3 in question in the transmission data buffer unit 34.<br>
This is because there is a high possibility that when the CQI value shows bad quality, a receiving error occurs even though data are transmitted to the mobile terminal 3 in question at a high speed, it is preferable to achieve low power consumption in the mobile terminal 3 in question and to allocate the radio resources to another mobile terminal 3 having a good CQI value rather than to transmit data to the mobile terminal 3 in question, and therefore the throughput of the whole mobile communications system can be improved. [0080]<br>
Furthermore, when the load on the downlink scheduling which the protocol processing unit 33 checked in step ST24 is high, the protocol processing unit 33 judges that the mobile terminal 3 which has transmitted a "Sleep request signal" to the base station cannot carry out a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense).<br>
Causing the mobile terminal 3 to implement a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense), the load becomes high as compared with the general receiving operation for the following reasons : the downlink scheduler unit 42 has to ensure a resource<br><br>
for every DRX cycle of the monitor signal with which the mobile terminal 3 in question checks to see whether there exist data destined for the mobile terminal itself; it is impossible to transmit data to the mobile terminal 3 which is performing a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) ; and it is necessary to judge whether or not the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active (in a broad sense) . Therefore, the reason why when the load on the downlink scheduling is high, the protocol processing unit 33 judges that the mobile terminal which has transmitted a "Sleep request signal" to the base station cannot carry out a DRX operation during Active is because there is a case in which the downlink scheduler unit 42 cannot support a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) from the viewpoint of the scheduling load. [0081]<br>
In this example, the protocol processing unit 33 judges whether the mobile station can carry out the DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense), as previously mentioned, though instead of the protocol processing unit 33, either the downlink scheduler unit 42 or the uplink scheduler unit 43 can carry out the judgment, or the downlink scheduler unit 42 and the uplink scheduler unit 43 can carry out the judgment in cooperation with each other.<br>
i       The information used for the judgment can be other than the pieces of information which are checked in steps ST21 to ST24 , or all the pieces of information which are checked in steps ST21 to ST24 do not have to be used. [0082]<br>
)       As can be seen from the above description, in accordance<br><br>
with this Embodiment 1, when judging whether or not a mobile terminal 3 is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, and then judging that the mobile station 3 is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, if the base station 2 judges that the mobile station is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active, the mobile terminal 3 temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units and the data reception processing units of the mobile terminal 3 . Therefore, this Embodiment offers an advantage of being able to achieve low power consumption in the mobile terminal 3 efficiently. [0083]<br>
More specifically, because, when the mobile terminal 3 is not performing a DTX operation during Active (in a broad sense) (when the mobile terminal is performing a transmitting operation), the electric power source of the transmission processing units (a portion used for only radio communications) of the mobile terminal 3 is turned on, effective low power consumption cannot be achieved even if the mobile terminal performs a DRX operation.<br>
However, by notifying a "Sleep request signal" which the mobile terminal 3 generates on the basis of the information which only the mobile terminal 3 can know (e.g., information<br>
i  indicating whether there exist data in the transmission data<br>
buffer unit 13 of the mobile terminal 3) to the base station<br>
2, the base station 2 can perform a DRX operation more positively<br>
and simultaneously in synchronization with a DTX operation.<br>
Thereby, low power consumption can be achieved more<br>
)  effectively in the mobile terminal 3 . As a result, the standby<br><br>
time and the duration of call, and so on of the mobile terminal<br>
3 can be lengthened.<br>
[0084]<br>
In this Embodiment 1, the example in which the mobile terminal 3 transmits a "Sleep request signal" to the base station 2 is shown. As an alternative, in a case in which the mobile terminal 3 does not make any Sleep request, the mobile terminal 3 can transmit a "Sleep non-request signal" to the base station 2.<br>
Hereafter, an example of the operation at the time of using a "Sleep non-request signal" will be explained with reference to Fig. 16.<br>
In the steps designated by the same reference characters as those shown in Fig. 4, the same processes as those explained with reference to Fig. 4 are carried out and the explanation of these processes will be omitted hereafter. [0085]<br>
Hereafter, a case in which the mobile terminal and the base station are placed in a state 2-A "Active (in a narrow sense)" of Fig. 13 will be considered (step ST1601).<br>
When the mobile terminal 3 is placed in a state 2 "Active<br>
(in a narrow sense) " of Fig. 13, the DTX judging unit 19 of the<br>
mobile terminal 3 judges whether or not the mobile terminal is<br>
able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active<br>
i  (step ST1602).<br>
More specifically, the DTX judging unit 19 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able to perform a DTX operation during Active. [0086]<br>
Hereafter, as examples of a DTX operation, an operation<br><br>
of not transmitting (DTX: Discontinuous Transmission) information which the mobile terminal 3 uses for uplink user data or downlink scheduling (for example, CQI) , a pilot signal (a signal which is used for synchronous detection compensation of uplink data, phase compensation of uplink data, and so on) , and a reference signal (Sounding Reference Signal) intended for measurement of the uplink channel quality will be explained.<br>
The DTX judging unit 19 carries out the judgment of whether or not the mobile terminal is able to perform a DTX operation by, for example, checking to see whether there exist data in the transmission data buffer unit 13.<br>
Concretely, when there exist no data in the transmission data buffer unit 13, the DTX judging unit 19 judges that the mobile terminal can perform a DTX operation, whereas when there exist data in the transmission data buffer unit 13, the DTX judging unit 19 judges that the mobile terminal cannot perform a DTX operation.<br>
The DTX judging unit 19 outputs the result of the judgment of whether or not the mobile terminal is able to perform a DTX operation to the protocol processing unit 11. [0087]<br>
When the judgment result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal cannot perform a DTX operation, i.e. , when the judgment result shows that the mobile terminal cannot make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, the Sleep request signal generating unit 20 of the mobile terminal 3 generates a Sleep non-request signal according to an instruction from the protocol processing unit 11, and outputs, as control data, the Sleep non-request signal to the transmission data buffer unit 13.<br><br>
[0088]<br>
In this case, the Sleep non-request signal is a signal having all of the following meanings (1) to (6):<br>
(1)	the mobile terminal 3 ends a DTX operation period<br>
during Active;<br>
(2)	there exist data to be transmitted in the transmission<br>
data buffer unit 13 of the mobile terminal 3 or there exist data<br>
to be transmitted immediately;<br>
(3)	the mobile terminal notifies the amount of data in the transmission data buffer unit 13;<br>
(4)	the mobile terminal makes a request for allocation of uplink resources (scheduling);<br><br>
(5)	the mobile terminal makes a request to continue staying in the Active state; and<br>
(6)	the mobile terminal makes a request to end a DRX operation period during Active, either one of the meanings (1) to (6), or a combination of some of the meanings.<br>
As an alternative, the Sleep non-request signal can be a signal which is notified and transmitted to the base station 2, the signal having all of the above-mentioned (1) to (6), a combination of some of the meanings, or either one of the meanings (1) to (6). [0089]<br>
When the Sleep request signal generating unit 20 stores the control data (the Sleep non-request signal) in the transmission data buffer unit 13, the encoder unit 14 of the mobile terminal 3 carries out an encoding process of encoding the control data (the Sleep non-request signal) stored in the transmission data buffer unit 13. I       After the encoder unit 14 carries out the encoding process,<br><br>
the modulating unit 15 of the mobile terminal 3 modulates the control data (the Sleep non-request signal) on which the encoding process has been performed, and then outputs the modulated control data (the Sleep request signal) to the antenna 16.<br>
The antenna 16 of the mobile terminal 3 transmits, as a radio signal, the control data which the modulating unit 15 has modulated (the Sleep non-request signal) to the base station 2 (step ST1603) . [0090]<br>
The example in which the mobile terminal 3 transmits, as a radio signal, the control data (the Sleep non-request signal) to the base station 2 is shown, though as the method of notifying the Sleep non-request signal, there can be provided, in addition to a method of mapping the signal onto a physical channel, a method of mapping the signal onto a MAC header or the like as a MAC signaling, and the like. [0091]<br>
When receiving the radio signal transmitted thereto from the mobile terminal 3, the antenna 37 of the base station 2 outputs the radio signal to the demodulating unit 38.<br>
When receiving the radio signal from the antenna 37, the demodulating unit 38 of the base station 2 performs a demodulation process on the radio signal and then outputs the control data (the Sleep non-request signal) which the demodulating unit has obtained by demodulating the radio signal to the decoder unit 39.<br>
The decoder unit 3 9 of the base station 2 performs a decoding process on the control data (the Sleep non-request signal) which the demodulating unit 3 8 has obtained by<br><br>
demodulating the radio signal, and outputs the decoded control data (the Sleep non-request signal) to both the protocol processing unit 33 and the Sleep request signal judging unit 40. [0092]<br>
When receiving the control data from the decoder unit 39, the Sleep request signal judging unit 40 of the base station 2 judges whether or not the Sleep non-request signal is included in the control data and then outputs the result of the judgment to the protocol processing unit 33 (step ST1604).<br>
When receiving the judgment result indicating that the Sleep non-request signal is included in the control data from the Sleep request signal judging unit 40, the protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 judges that the mobile terminal 3 cannot start a DRX operation and then returns to the process of the step 1601.<br>
In contrast, when not receiving the judgment result showing that the Sleep non-request signal is included in the control data from the Sleep request signal judging unit 40, the protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 judges whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able to perform a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) (step ST5). [0093]<br>
When, in this step ST5, judging that the mobile terminal is unable to perform a DRX operation, the protocol processing unit 3 3 can carry out the judgment of step ST1604 and that of step ST5 repeatedly at certain intervals by using a timer or the like.<br>
In this case, the protocol processing unit 33 can carry out the judgment of step ST16 04 and that of step ST5 in an<br><br>
arbitrary order.<br>
In contrast, when, in step ST5, judging that the mobile terminal is able to perform a DRX operation, the protocol processing unit 33 performs the processes of steps ST6 and ST7 . [0094]<br>
When receiving the radio signal from the antenna 16, the demodulating unit 17 of the mobile terminal 3 performs a demodulation process on the radio signal and then outputs the control data (the judgment result) which the demodulating unit has obtained by demodulating the radio signal to the decoder unit 18.<br>
The decoder unit 18 of the mobile terminal 3 performs a decoding process on the control data (the judgment result) which the demodulating unit 17 has obtained by demodulating the radio signal, and then outputs the decoded control data (the judgment result) to the protocol processing unit 11.<br>
The control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 judges whether the mobile terminal has received a notification indicating switching of the state of the mobile terminal 3 to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST1605).<br>
When the control unit 23, in step ST1605, judges that the mobile terminal has received a notification indicating switching to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active, the control unit performs the processes of steps ST10 and ST11.<br>
In contrast, when, in step ST1605, the control unit 23<br>
does not judge that the mobile terminal has received a<br>
notification indicating switching to a DRX/DTX operation period<br>
during Active, the control unit performs the process of step<br>
)  ST12.<br><br>
[0095]<br>
In this Embodiment 1, the example in which a base station 2 transmits a judgment result indicating whether or not a mobile terminal 3 is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active to the mobile terminal 3 is shown. As an alternative, when the base station 2 judges that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active, the base station can transmit a transition instruction for making a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) to the mobile terminal 3 so as to cause the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) according to the transition instruction from the base station 2. [0096] Embodiment 2.<br>
Fig. 6 is a sequence diagram showing the description of processing carried out by a mobile communications system in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention. Hereafter, the description of the processing carried out by the mobile communications system will be explained.<br>
When judging that a mobile terminal 3 is able to perform a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) in the same way as that mentioned in Embodiment 1, a protocol processing i unit 33 of a base station 2, when performing a DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense), determines both a DRX cycle used for the DRX operation during Active (in a broad sense) and a DTX cycle used for the DTX operation during Active (in broad sense) which are most suitable for reduction in the power )  consumption of the mobile terminal 3 (step ST31).<br><br>
[0097]<br>
In this case, the most suitable DRX cycle and DTX cycle are the ones which lengthen a time period during which the electric power supply of the transmission processing units and the reception processing units of the mobile terminal 3 (a portion used for only radio communications) can be turned off as much as possible (i.e. , which lengthen the time period within the limits of an optimal time period).<br>
As concrete examples, a case in which the most suitable DRX cycle and DTX cycle are determined in such a way that they are equal to each other, a case in which the most suitable DRX cycle and DTX cycle are determined in such a way that one of them is an integer multiple of the other one and the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle are harmonic to each other, and so on can be considered. Furthermore, as other concrete examples, a case in which the DRX period and the DTX period are determined in such a way that they are equal to each other, a case in which the DRX period and the DTX period are determined in such a way that one of them is an integer multiple of the other one and the DRX period and the DTX period are harmonic to each other, and so on can be considered.<br>
Hereafter, the case in which the DRX cycle and the DTX<br>
cycle are determined in such a way that they are equal to each<br>
other, and so on will be explained in detail, though using the<br>
&gt;  same method, the DRX period and the DTX period can be determined<br>
in such a way that, for example, they are equal to each other.<br>
Hereafter,  a  concrete  example  of  the method of<br>
lengthening the time period during which the electric power<br>
supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the<br>
)  mobile terminal 3 can be turned off as much as possible will<br><br>
be explained with reference to Fig. 7. [0098]<br>
In Fig. 7, a portion in which a period during which no transmitting operation is carried out and a period during which no receiving operation is carried out overlap each other is the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned off.<br>
' A pattern 1 of Fig. 7 shows an example (corresponding to Embodiment 1) in which the base station does not determine the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle in step ST31 of Fig. 6. [0099]<br>
A pattern 2 of Fig. 7 shows an example of the case in which the base station, in step ST31 of Fig. 6, determines the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle in order to lengthen the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned off as much as possible.<br>
As the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle which are determined for the pattern 2, there can be provided the following examples (1) to (3) :<br>
(1)	the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle which are made to be equal to each other;<br>
(2)	the DTX cycle which is made to be an integer multiple of the DRX cycle (the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle are determined in such a way that one of them is an integer multiple of the other one); and<br>
(3)	the DTX cycle which is made to be an integer divisor of the DRX cycle (the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle are determined in such a way that one of them is an integer multiple of the<br><br>
other one). [0100]<br>
A pattern 3 of Fig. 7 shows an example of the case in which the base station, in step ST31 of Fig. 6, determines the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle and also determines the starting point (Starting Point) of the DTX cycle and that of the DRX cycle simultaneously in order to lengthen the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned off as much as possible. It is considered that making the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle be harmonic to each other includes the adjustment of the above-mentioned starting points.<br>
At this time, the synchronization between the starting point of the DTX cycle and that of the DRX cycle is not limited to only a case in which they are made to completely coincide with each other, and a certain fixed offset can exist between them.<br>
As the offset, there can be an offset between the uplink and downlink timings. Furthermore, it can be considered an offset which occurs when a time required for an Active period during a DRX operation period differs from a time required for an Active period during a DTX operation period. [0101]<br>
In the case of the pattern 3, the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned off can be lengthened as compared with the case of the pattern 2.<br>
A pattern 4 of Fig. 17 shows an example of the case in<br>
which the base station, in step ST31 of Fig. 6, achieves the<br>
)  synchronization between the starting point (Starting Point) of<br><br>
the DTX cycle and that of the DRX cycle in order to lengthen the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned off as much as possible. It is considered that making the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle tie harmonic to each other includes the adjustment of the above-mentioned starting points.<br>
In a case in which, for example, the DTX cycle or the DRX<br>
cycle is repeated only once, because even if the DTX cycle and<br>
the DRX cycle are determined, the determination of the DTX cycle<br>
and the DRX cycle is used only once, it is almost meaningless.<br>
[0102]<br>
In a case in which by using the pattern 4, for example, the starting point of the DTX cycle and that of the DRX cycle are synchronized or either the DTX cycle or the DRX cycle is repeated only once, the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned off can be lengthened.<br>
At this time, the synchronization between the starting point of the DTX cycle and that of the DRX cycle is not limited to only a case in which they are made to completely coincide with each other, and a certain fixed offset can exist between them.<br>
As the offset, there can be an offset between the uplink i and downlink timings. Furthermore, it can be considered an offset which occurs when a time required for an Active period during a DRX operation period differs from a time required for an Active period during a DTX operation period. [0103] )       When determining the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle, the<br><br>
protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 can determine them in consideration of the pieces of information checked in steps ST21 to ST24 of Fig. 5 including "whether there exist waiting data to be transmitted to a mobile terminal 3 which belongs thereto", "QoS of service", "information which the downlink scheduler uses", and "the load of the downlink scheduler".<br>
Furthermore, when determining the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle, the protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 can determine the DTX cycle which is used during Active {in a broad sense) to be infinite.<br>
When the protocol processing unit determines the DTX cycle to be infinite, the mobile terminal 3 does not transmit any information used for downlink scheduling (e.g., CQI) during a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (in a broad sense). [0104]<br>
Either the downlink scheduler unit 42 or the uplink scheduler unit 43 can perform the process of determining the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle, instead of protocol processing unit 33. As an alternative, the downlink scheduler unit 42 and the uplink scheduler unit 43 can perform the process of determining the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle in cooperation with each other.<br>
In this example, before processing step ST6, the base station performs the process of step ST31, as previously mentioned, though the base station can alternatively perform the process of step ST31 at the same time when the base station performs the process of step ST6. [0105]<br>
When determining the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle, the &gt;     protocol processing unit  33 of the base station 2 causes the<br><br>
state of the base station 2 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST6), like in the case of above-mentioned Embodiment 1.<br>
Next, the protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 outputs, as control data, the judgment result showing whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able to perform a DRX operation during Active {in a broad sense), i.e., the judgment result showing whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active to the transmission data buffer unit 34 . The protocol processing unit 33 also outputs, as control data, the result (DTX cycle information and DRX cycle information) of the determination of the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle to the transmission data buffer unit 34.<br>
It is assumed that the DTX cycle information includes an indicator indicating the DTX cycle, and so on.  It is further assumed that the DRX cycle information includes an indicator indicating the DRX cycle, and so on. [0106]<br>
When the protocol processing unit 33 stores the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) in the transmission data buffer unit 34, the encoder unit 35 of the base station 2 performs an encoding process on the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) stored in the transmission data buffer unit 34.<br>
When the encoder unit 35 performs the encoding process,<br>
the modulating unit 36 of the base station 2 modulates the<br>
control data (the judgment result and the determination result)<br>
on which the encoding process has been performed, and then<br>
)  outputs the control data modulated by the modulating unit (the<br><br>
judgment result and the determination result} to the antenna 37. [0107]<br>
The antenna 3 7 of the base station 2 transmits, as a radio signal, the signal which the modulating unit 3 6 has modulated with the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) to the mobile terminal 3 (step ST32).<br>
The example in which the base station 2 transmits, as a radio signal, the signal which is modulated with the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) to the mobile terminal 3 is shown, though as the method of notifying the judgment result and the determination result, there can be provided, in addition to a method of mapping the control data onto a physical channel, a method of mapping the control data onto a MAC header or the like as a MAC signaling, and the like.<br>
The notification of the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle can be carried out only when they are changed, or the notification of the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle can be carried out regularly regardless of whether or not they are changed.<br>
As an alternative, the starting points (Starting Points) of the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle can be notified.  Their starting points are notified with, their slot numbers, frame numbers, symbol numbers, or the like.<br>
The notification of the starting points of the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle can be carried out only when they are changed, or the notification of the starting points of the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle can be carried out regularly regardless of whether or not they are changed. [0108]<br>
Like in the case of above-mentioned Embodiment 1, in the<br><br>
process of step ST2, when a Sleep request signal is transmitted by using a channel (a transport channel or a physical channel) in which a response signal (an ACK signal/NACK signal) from the base station 2 to the mobile terminal 3 exists, i.e., when the Sleep request signal is transmitted from the mobile terminal 3 to the base station 2 by using a channel {a transport channel and a physical channel) which is supported by high-speed retransmission control withHARQ, the response signal (the ACK signal/NACK signal) can be transmitted together with the control data (the judgment result and the determination result).<br>
This case has an advantage of eliminating the necessity to perform further downlink scheduling and being able to notify the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) with a shorter delay (Delay) as compared with the case in which the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) are transmitted by using another channel (e.g., a DL-SCH). [0109]<br>
When receiving the radio signal transmitted thereto from the base station 2, the antenna 16 of the mobile terminal 3 outputs the radio signal to the demodulating unit 17 (step ST33).<br>
When receiving the radio signal from the antenna 16, the demodulating unit 17 of the mobile terminal 3 performs a demodulation process on the radio signal, and then outputs the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) which the demodulating unit has obtained by demodulating the radio signal to the decoder unit 18. )       The decoder unit 18 of the mobile terminal 3 performs a<br><br>
decoding process to the control data (the judgment result and the determination result) which the demodulating unit 17 has obtained by demodulating the radio signal, and outputs the decoded control data {the decoded judgment result) to the protocol processing unit 11. The decoder unit also outputs the decoded control data (the decoded determination result) to both the DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22. [0110]<br>
The control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 judges whether to cause the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active {the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST9).<br>
When, in the process of step ST1, the judgment result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, and the protocol processing unit 11 acquires the control data {the judgment result) of the base station 2 indicating that the mobile terminal can make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active, the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 judges to cause the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13). [0111]<br>
i When receiving the decoded control data (the decoded DTX cycle information) from the decoder unit 18, i.e., when receiving the DTX cycle information transmitted from the base station 2, the DTX cycle storage unit 21 of the mobile terminal 3 stores the DTX cycle information (steps ST34 and ST35).<br>
D       When receiving the decoded control data (the decoded DRX<br><br>
cycle information) from the decoder unit 18, i.e., when receiving the DRX cycle information transmitted from the base station 2, the DRX cycle storage unit 22 of the mobile terminal 3 stores the DRX cycle information (steps ST34 and SI'S5) .<br>
The DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22 overwrite the DTX cycle information and the DRx cycle information which are already stored therein with the DTx cycle information and the DRX cycle information which are outputted from the decoder unit 18 to store them, respectively. As an alternative, the DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22 store the DTX cycle information and the DRx cycle information which are outputted from the decoder unit separately from the DTX cycle information and the DRX cycle information which are already stored therein, respectively.<br>
Furthermore,  when receiving pieces of information showing the starting points of the DTX cycle and the DRx cycle from the decoder unit 18, the DTX cycle storage unit and the DRX cycle storage unit also store them. [0112]<br>
When the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 judges to cause the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13), the control unit 23 causes the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) in the same way that that in accordance with above-mentioned Embodiment 1 does (step ST10). [0113]<br>
After the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 causes the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a<br><br>
DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) , the control unit 23 causes the mobile terminal to perform a DRX operation and a DTX operation in the same way that that of above-mentioned Embodiment 1 does (step ST11).<br>
More specifically, the control unit 23 temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units (e.g. , the encoder unit 14 and the modulating unit 15} in the cycle indicated by the DTX cycle information stored in the DTX cycle storage unit 21.<br>
Furthermore, the control unit 23 temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data reception processing units {e.g. , the demodulating unit 17 and the decoder unit 18) in the cycle indicated by the DRX cycle information stored in the DRX cycle storage unit 22.<br>
As an alternative, during a period during which the period during which the supply of the electric power can be stopped temporarily according to the DTX cycle information and the period during which the supply of the electric power can be stopped temporarily according to the DRX cycle information overlap each other, the control unit 23 can temporarily stop the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units and the data reception processing units.<br>
In this embodiment, although the example in which the control unit 23 temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the encoder unit 14, the modulating unit 15, the demodulating unit 17, and the decoder unit 18 is explained, the targets for which the supply of the electric power is stopped are only an example. For example, the supply of the electric power to the protocol processing unit 11, the application unit 12, the transmission data buffer unit 13, the DTX judging unit<br><br>
19, the Sleep request signal generating unit 20, the DTX cycle storage unit 21, the DRX cycle storage unit 22, and so on can be stopped temporarily. [0114]<br>
When, in the process of step ST1, the protocol processing unit 11 acquires the control data (the judgment result) of the base station 2 indicating that the mobile terminal is unable to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active even if the judgment result of the DTX judging unit 19 shows that the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, the control unit 23 of the mobile terminal 3 performs only a DTX operation without causing the state of the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) (step ST12).<br>
More specifically, the control unit 23 does not stop the supply of the electric power to the data reception processing units (e.g. , the demodulating unit 17 and the decoder unit 18) , but temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units (e.g., the encoder unit 14 and the modulating unit 15) during only the period indicated by the DTX cycle information stored in the DTX cycle storage unit 21.<br>
As an alternative, because the control unit cannot temporarily stop the supply of the electric power to the reception processing units, the control unit does not have to perform the process of temporarily stopping the supply of the electric power to the transmission processing units. [0115]<br>
As can be seen from the above description, in accordance<br><br>
with this embodiment 2, a mobile station 3 is constructed in such a way as to, when receiving DTX cycle information and DRX cycle information from a base station 2, stop the supply of the electric power to the transmission processing units and the reception processing units thereof according to the DTX cycle information and the DRX cycle information. Therefore, the present embodiment offers an advantage of being able to stop the supply of the electric power to the transmission processing units and the reception processing units during only an optimal time period which is determined in consideration of the status of the mobile terminal 3 and the status of the whole mobile communications system, thereby achieving low power consumption in the mobile terminal 3 more efficiently. [0116]<br>
More specifically, in addition to the advantages provided by above-mentioned Embodiment 1, this Embodiment 2 can offer the following advantages.<br>
This embodiment is advantageous in that, every time when a base station judges whether or not a mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (in a broad sense) , the base station can determine a most suitable DTX cycle and a most suitable DRX cycle in consideration of the status of the mobile terminal 3 at that time and the status of the whole mobile communications system, i In addition, the mobile terminal can carry out a transmitting operation and a receiving operation simultaneously by synchronizing the starting point of the DTX cycle and that of the DRX cycle. As a result, the time period during which the electric power supply of the portion used for only radio communications of the mobile terminal 3 can be turned<br><br>
off can be further lengthened.<br>
Thereby, low power consumption can be achieved more effectively in the mobile terminal 3 . As a result, the standby time and the duration of call, and so on of the mobile terminal 3 can be lengthened. [0117]<br>
Furthermore, a case in which the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle are determined, in step ST31, by using the pattern 2 in such a way that they are equal to each other.<br>
An example of a method of, in this case, notifying the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle from the base station to the mobile terminal and a method of applying the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle in the mobile terminal will be explained hereafter.<br>
In that case, in step ST32, only the DTX cycle (or the DRX cycle) can be notified from the base station to the mobile terminal.<br>
The mobile terminal which has received only the DTX cycle stores the received DTX cycle in both the DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22 (step ST35) . As an alternative, the mobile terminal which has received only the DRX cycle stores the received DRX cycle in both the DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22 . After that, the mobile terminal performs a DRX operation and a DTX operation in the stored equal cycles, respectively.<br>
Thereby, the amount of the information (the cycles) which is notified from the base station to the mobile terminal can be reduced. In the viewpoint of effective use of the radio resources, this method is useful.<br>
Furthermore, in the case in which the DRX cycle and the i  DTX cycle are equal to each other, the DTX cycle storage unit<br><br>
21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22 can be integrated into one storage unit.  As a result, this embodiment can provide an advantage of reducing the hardware of the mobile terminal. [0118]<br>
Furthermore, a case in which the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle are determined in step ST31 by using the pattern 2 in such a way that they are harmonic to each other (they have a fixed relationship, such as an integer multiple relationship or an integer divisor relationship in the above-mentioned pattern 2, or they have the pattern 3, the pattern 4, or the like) will be considered.<br>
An example of a method of, in this case, notifying the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle from the base station to the mobile terminal and a method of applying the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle in the mobile terminal will be explained hereafter.<br>
In this case, in step ST32, only the DTX cycle (or the DRX cycle) and the information of how the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle are harmonic to each other can be notified from the base station to the mobile terminal.<br>
The mobile terminal which has received only the DTX cycle and the information of how the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle are harmonic to each other stores the received DTX cycle in the DTX cycle storage unit 21, and also stores the result which it has calculated based on. the DTX cycle and the information of how the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle are harmonic to each other in the DRX cycle storage unit 22 (step ST35) . As an alternative, the mobile terminal which has received only the DRX cycle and the information of how the DTX cycle and the DRX cycle are harmonic to each other stores the result which it has calculated based on the DRX cycle and the information of how the DTX cycle<br><br>
As a result, the amount of the information (the cycles} which is notified from the base station to the mobile terminal can be reduced.  In the viewpoint of effective use of the radio resources, this method is useful. [0119]<br>
When the harmonic relationship {an integer multiple relationship, an integer divisor relationship, or a fixed relationship) hasavalue (static: Static) which has been agreed between the mobile terminal and the base station in advance, it is not necessary to, in step ST32, notify the harmonic relationship from the base station to the mobile terminal. As a result, the amount of the information {the harmonic relationship) which is notified from the base station to the mobile terminal can be further reduced. In the viewpoint of effective use of the radio resources, this method is useful.<br>
Also in the case of the pattern 3 and the pattern 4, the above-mentioned reduction in the amount of information can be achieved, and an advantage of making effective use of the radio resources can be provided similarly. [0120]<br>
Hereafter, a variant 1 will be explained.<br>
The base station can change the method of determining the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle according to a condition. As examples of the method, there can be provided (1) a method of, only when the condition is satisfied, carrying out step ST31 to, for example, make the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle be equal to each other or make them be harmonic to each other, whereas when the condition is not satisfied, not carrying out step ST31; and<br>
(2) a method of, when the condition is satisfied, carrying<br><br>
out step ST31 to, for example, make the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle be harmonic to each other, whereas also when the condition is not satisfied, carrying out step ST31 to, for example, make the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle be harmonic to each other in such a way that they have a harmonic relationship different from the relationship which is established when the condition is satisfied. [0121]<br>
Examples of the condition include "whether to maintain the uplink synchronization", "whether or not the DRX cycle (or the DTX cycle) is equal to or longer than a threshold", and "whether or not the time which has elapsed after receiving TA finally is equal to or longer than a threshold".<br>
As an example of the variant 1, a case in which the transmitting operation which the mobile terminal 3 performs in the DTX cycle is the one which the mobile terminal performs to allow the base station to carry out measurement of the uplink timing will be considered. [03.22]<br>
When maintaining the uplink synchronization in a DRX/DTX operation period during Active, the base station has to determine the DTX cycle which satisfies the condition that the uplink synchronization is maintained.<br>
In contrast, when not maintaining the uplink  synchronization, the base station does not have to determine the DTX cycle which satisfies the condition that the uplink synchronization is maintained. Therefore, there is a merit of making the method of determining the DRX cycle and the method of determining the DTX cycle differ from each other according   to whether or not the condition is satisfied.<br><br>
Concretely, when maintaining the uplink synchronization in the DRX/DTX operation period during Active, the base station carries out step ST31, whereas when not maintaining the uplink synchronization in the DRX/DTX operation period during Active, the base station does not carry out step ST31. Of course, there can be a case in which, when maintaining the uplink synchronization in the DRX/DTX operation period during Active, the base station does not carry out step ST31, whereas when not maintaining the uplink synchronization in the DRX/DTX operation period during Active, the base station carries out step ST31.<br>
As a result, when, for example, the uplink synchronization is maintained, the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle can be made to be equal to each other and their starting points are synchronized (the pattern 3} , whereas when the uplink synchronization is not maintained, the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle can be made to, for example, differ from each other. [0123]<br>
Furthermore, a case in which, in step ST32, for example, only the DRX cycle and its starting point are notified from the base station to the mobile terminal will be considered.<br>
In this case, when maintaining the uplink synchronization, the mobile terminal stores the DRX cycle and its starting point which are notified thereto in step ST33 in the DTX cycle storage unit 21 and the DRX cycle storage unit 22, and applies them also to a DTX operation.<br>
In  contrast,  when  not  maintaining  the  uplink<br>
synchronization, the mobile terminal stores the DRX cycle and<br>
its starting point which are notified thereto in step ST33 only<br>
in the DRX cycle storage unit 22, but does not apply them to<br>
  a DTX operation without storing them in the DTX cycle storage<br><br>
unit 21. At that time, the DTX operation can be made to follow the previous contents of the DTX cycle storage unit 21. [0124]<br>
In this way, while the amount of the information (the cycles) notified from the base station to the mobile terminal can be reduced, the determining method of determining the DRX cycle and the determining method of determining the DTX cycle can be made to differ from each other according to whether or not the condition is satisfied.<br>
In the viewpoint of effective use of the radio resources, it is useful to reduce the amount of the information notified from the base station to the mobile terminal. In this case, a notification of information indicating whether to maintain the uplink synchronization from the base station to the mobile terminal can be made independently of the notification of the cycles. Also in this case, because the amount of information of the parameter showing whether to maintain the uplink synchronization becomes small as compared with the amount of information used for notifying the DTX cycle, this variant is useful in the viewpoint of effective use of the radio resource. [0125]<br>
In this Embodiment 2 and the variant 1, the case in which the DRX cycle is transmitted from the base station to the mobile terminal is mentioned, though there can be a case in which the DRX cycle (or the DTX cycle) is determined beforehand. The above-mentioned example can be applied to even such a case.<br>
Concretely, when, in step ST32, the judgment result<br>
indicating whether or not the mobile terminal is able to perform<br>
a DRX operation is notified, the mobile terminal stores the DRX<br>
  cycle which is determined beforehand in the DTX cycle storage<br><br>
unit 21 (step ST35} . After that, the mobile terminal performs a DRX operation and a DTX operation in the stored equal cycles, respectively.<br>
The DRX cycle (or the DTX cycle) which is determined beforehand can be a value which is statically determined as a value of the mobile communications system, or can be notified semi-statically by using an L3 message or the like which is transmitted from the base station to the mobile terminal when a session of a radio bearer is started. [0126]<br>
In this Embodiment 2 and the variant 1, the example in which the mobile terminal 3 transmits a. "Sleep request signal" to the base station 2 is shown. As an alternative, when the mobile terminal 3 does not make any Sleep request, the mobile terminal 3 can transmit a "Sleep non-request signal" to the base station 2.<br>
Fig. 18 is a sequence diagram showing the description of processing which is carried out by the mobile communications system in the case in which a "Sleep non-request signal" in accordance with Embodiment 2 of the present invention is used. Because the detailed explanation of Fig. 18 is the same as the explanation of Fig. 6, the detailed explanation of Fig. 18 will be omitted.<br>
Furthermore, in this Embodiment 2, the example in which  the base station 2 transmits the judgment result showing whether or not the mobile terminal 3 is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active to the mobile terminal 3 is shown. As an alternative, when determining that the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period   during Active, the base station 2 can transmit a transition<br><br>
instruction for making a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13} to thft mobile terminal 3 so as to cause the mobile terminal 3 to make a transition a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) according to the transition instruction from the base station 2. [0127] Embodiment 3.<br>
Fig. 8 is a sequence diagram showing the description of processing carried out by a mobile communications system in accordance with Embodiment 3 of the present invention.<br>
In above-mentioned Embodiments 1 and 2, the example in which a base station 2 determines whether or not a mobile terminal 3 is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, and, when the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active, th§ mobile terminal temporarily stops the supply of the electric power to the data transmission processing units and the data reception processing units thereof if the base station 2 determines that the mobile terminal 3 is able to make a transition to a DTX operation period during Active is shown. The protocol processing unit 11 of the mobile terminal 3 can determine whether to give a higher priority to low power consumption (or can determine whether to give a higher priority to throughput) ,<br>
  and can transmit a parameter showing the result of the determination to the base station 2.<br>
In this case, the protocol processing unit 11 constructs a priority determining means, and the transmission data buffer unit 13, the encoder unit 14, the modulating unit 15, and the<br>
  antenna 16 construct a parameter transmitting means.<br>
[0128]<br>
More specifically, in accordance with this EmbodiTnent 3, the parameter showing whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption is disposed in mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) showing the capabilities of the mobile terminal 3. In this Embodiment 3, an example in which the parameter showing whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption is disposed will be explained, though a parameter showing whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to throughput can be alternatively disposed.<br>
This parameter is not a value specific to the mobile terminal 3, and can be varied according to various factors including the state of the mobile terminal 3 and the user's intention.<br>
As an alternative, the entire mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) including the parameter showing whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption can be varied.<br>
  [0129]<br>
In accordance with this Embodiment 3 , the mobile terminal capability information {UE Capabilities) including the above-mentioned parameter can be notified from the mobile terminal 3 to the network at a time other than a time of RRC<br>
  (Radio Resource Control) connection (such as a time of attach, a time of calling, or a time of location registration).<br>
More specifically, the mobile terminal 3 notifies the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) indicating the capabilities of the mobile terminal 3 when the<br>
  mobile terminal capability information is changed.  As an<br><br>
alternative, even when the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) is not changed, the mobile terminal can notify the mobile terminal capability infoinnation at predetermined intervals.<br>
In the case in which the mobile terminal notifies the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) when the mobile terminal capability information is changed, the mobile terminal can notify only a changed parameter or can notify the entire mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) . [0130]<br>
Hereafter, the description of the processing carried out by the mobile communications system will be explained concretely.<br>
Every time when the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) is changed or at predetermined intervals, the protocol processing unit 11 of the mobile terminal 3 outputs, as control data, the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) including the parameter indicating whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption to the transmission data buffer unit 13.<br>
The encoder unit 14 of the mobile terminal 3 performs an encoding process on the mobile terminal capability inf oxmation (UE Capabilities) which is the control data stored in the transmission data buffer unit 13. [0131]<br>
The modulating unit 15 of the mobile terminal 3 modulates the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) I  which is the control data on which the encoding process has been<br><br>
performed by the encoder unic 14, and the antenna 16 transmits, as a radio signal, the control data modulated by the mociulating unit 15 to the base station 2 (step ST41).<br>
In this embodiment, the example in which the mobile terminal 3 transmits, as the control data, the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) including the parameter to the base station 2 is shown. As an alternative, the mobile terminal 3 can transmit only the parameter to the base station 2. 10132}<br>
Hereafter, an example of the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) will be explained.<br>
For example, in a case in which the mobile terminal 3 is used in a mode in which it is inserted into a card slot of a notebook, personal computer, the mobile terminal 3 enters either a state of "the priority of low power consumption: low" or a state of "the priority of throughput: high".<br>
In contrast, in a case in which the mobile terminal 3 is used in a mode of a mobile phone, the mobile terminal 3 enters either a state of "the priority of low power consumption: high" or a state of "the priority of throughput: low".<br>
This is because, in these cases, the capacity of the battery of the notebook personal computer is large as compared with the capacity of the battery of the mobile phone.<br>
[0133]<br>
In this Embodiment 3, the example in which the mobile<br>
terminal 3 transmits, as the control data, the mobile terminal<br>
capability information  (UE  Capabilities)  including the<br>
parameter to the base station 2 is shown. Concrete methods of<br>
)  notifying the mobile terminal capability information (UE<br><br>
Capabilities) include a method of mapping the mobile terminal capability information onto a layer 3 message according to a protocol called RRC (Radio Resoxirce Control), a method of mapping the mobile terminal capability information onto a physical channel, and a method of mapping the mobile terminal capability information onto a MAC header or the like as a MAC signaling. [0134]<br>
In this case, if the mobile terminal capability information is notified at the same time when a "Sleep request signal" as shown in above-mentioned Embodiment 1 is transmitted, the mobile terminal capability information directly shows the priority of the request which the mobile terminal 3 has made to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) by using the "Sleep request signal" and is effective.<br>
Especially, a mapping method effective for a case of mapping and notifying both the "Sleep request signal" and "the priority of low power consumption  (or the priority of throughput)" onto a physical channel will be disclosed. [0135]<br>
Conventionally (refer to the 3GPP Releasee standard TS25.309), there exists an LI signaling (a physical channel mapping signal) which is called a "Happy Bit" mapped onto a physical channel.<br>
The "Happy Bit" is an uplink indicator which is used to<br>
notify the base station 2 about whether or not the mobile<br>
terminal 3 is satisfied with the current "Serving Grant value"<br>
which is provided from the uplink scheduler unit 43 of the base<br>
)  station 2 to the mobile terminal 3 to enable uplink data<br><br>
transmission.<br>
That is, the "Happy Bit" is an indicator which is effective only at the time of uplink data transmission. In other words, because the case in which the mobile terminal 3 has made a request with the "Sleep request signal" means that the mobile terminal 3 has determined to start a DTX operation period during Active, there is no point in transmitting the "Happy Bit", but there is a point in transmitting "the priority of low power consumption (or the priority of throughput)".<br>
On the contrary, in a case in which the mobile terminal 3 has not vnade any request with the "Sleep request signal", because the mobile terminal 3 has not determined to start a DTX operation period during Active, there is a point in transmitting "Happy Bit" , but there is no point in transmitting "the priority of low power consumption {or the priority of throughput)". [0136]<br>
In a case in which the "Happy Bit", the "Sleep request signal", and "the priority of low power consumption {the priority of throughput)" are mapped, as an LI signaling, onto a physical channel without devising any method, they need three bits.<br>
For example, when they are mapped onto a physical channel as shown in Fig. 9, the same amount of information can be notified from the mobile terminal 3 to the base station 2 by using 2 bits, and therefore it becomes possible to reduce the amount of mapping onto the physical channel by 1 bit. This is effective from the viewpoint of effective use of the radio resources.<br>
Fig. 9 simply shows an example, and it can be assumed that any other mapping method is equivalent to the technology disclosed in this embodiment as long as the other mapping method<br><br>
includes the step of changing information shown by  between the "Happy Bit" and "the priority of low power consumption (or the priority of throughput)" according to whether or not a request with the "Sleep request signal" has been made. [0137]<br>
When the antenna 3 7 receives the radio signal transmitted thereto from the mobile terminal 3, the demodulating unit 3 8 of the base station 2 demodulates the radio signal (step ST42) .<br>
The decoder unit 39 of the base station 2 performs a decoding process on the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) which is the control data which the demodulating unit 38 has obtained by demodulating the radio signal, and stores the decoded mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) in the protocol processing unit 33 (step ST43). [0138]<br>
The protocol processing unit 33 of base station 2 checks to see whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption (or whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to the throughput) with reference to the parameter included in the mobile terminal capability information {UE Capabilities) (step ST44).<br>
When the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption, the protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 performs an operation of enabling the mobile terminal to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-B of Fig. 13) in order to achieve low power consumption during Active {in a broad sense) (the state 2 of Fig. 13) (step ST45).<br><br><br>
For example, the protocol processing unit enables the sequence in Fig. 4 to allow the base station 2 to receive the Sleep request signal transmitted from the mobile terminal 3, and to judge whether or not the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active. [0139]<br>
When the mobile terminal 3 does not give a higher piriority to low power consumption (i.e., when the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to the throughput) , the protocol processing unit 33 of the base station 2 performs an operation of disabling the mobile terminal to make a transition to a DRX/DTX operation period during Active (the state 2-E of Fig. 13) without achieving low power consumption during Active (in a broad sense) (the state 2 of Fig. 13) (step ST46).<br>
For example, the protocol processing unit does not judge whether or not the mobile terminal is able to make a transition to a DRX operation period during Active. [0140]<br>
As can be seen from the above description, the system in accordance with this embodiment 3 is constructed in such a way as to determine whether a mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption, and transmits a parameter showing the result of the determination to a base station 2. Therefore, the present embodiment offers an advantage of providing further efficient achievement of low power consumption during Active (in a broad sense) (the state 2 of Fig. 13) , and providing an optimal reduction in the power consumption of the mobile terminal 3. [0141]<br>
Furthermore, this Embodiment 3 can offer the following<br><br>
advantages.<br>
By notifying the parameter when the mobile terminal capability information {UE Capabilities) showing the capabilities of the mobile terminal 3 is changed, or by notifying the parameter in a predetermined cycle even when the mobile terminal capability information {UE Capabilities) is not changed, it is possible to notify the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) from the mobile terminal 3 to the base station 2 even if the mobile terminal 3 is during Active {the state 2 of Fig. 13) , This advantage becomes more remarkable in a case of a packet communication system which is based on a continuous connection. This is because the number of RRC connections decreases due to a continuous connection, and therefore the number of timings at which the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) can be notified is few as long as a conventional technology is simply used.<br>
Thereby, it becomes possible to notify a change in the parameter showing which achievement of low power consumption or improvement in the throughput the mobile terminal gives a higher priority from the mobile terminal 3 to the base station 2 even if the mobile terminal 3 is during Active {the state 2 of Fig. 13) , and low power consumption during Active (the state 2 of Fig. 13) can be achieved more effectively. As a result, a more optimal reduction in the power consumption of the mobile<br>
&gt;     terminal 3 can be achieved. [01421<br>
In a variant 1, the base station, in step ST44, can check to see whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption {or whether the mobile terminal 3 gives<br>
)  a higher priority to the throughput) , and, when determining that<br><br>
v.<br>
the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption, in step ST4 5, can set the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle to be equal to or longer than a threshold X.<br>
In contrast, when, in step ST44, determining that the mobile terminal 3 does not give a higher priority to low power consumption, the base station, in step ST4S, can set the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle to be shorter than the threshold X. [0143]<br>
The lengths of the DRX cycle and the DTX cycle affect low power consumption in the mobile terminal, and, because the period during which the electric power supply of the mobile terminal is turned off can be lengthened if the cycles are long, it becomes easy to achieve low power consumption. Therefore, this variant offers an advantage of being able to provide further efficient achievement of low power consumption during Active (in a broad sense) according to the state of the mobile terminal {the state 2 of Fig. 13} , and an optimal reduction in the power consumption of the mobile terminal 3.<br>
The variant 1 can also be implemented by separately notifying both the parameter indicating "whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption", and a parameter indicating "whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to the DRX cycle's becoming long (whether the mobile terminal allows the DRX cycle to become long)" or "whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to the DTX cycle's becoming long (whether the mobile terminal allows the DTX cycle to become long) " from the mobile terminal to the base station. [0144]<br>
In a variant 2, the base station, in step ST44, can check<br><br>
to see whether the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to the throughput (or the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption) , and, when determining that the mobile terminal 3 does not give a higher priority to the throughput, in step ST45, can allow the mobile terminal not to maintain the uplink synchronization during a DRX/DTX operation period during uplink Active.<br>
In contrast, when, in step ST44, determining that the mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to the throughput, the base station can disallow the mobile teinninal not to maintain the uplink synchronization during a DRX/DTX operation period during Active. [0145]<br>
In a case in which the uplink synchronization is not maintained, when data (control data or user data) are transmitted from the mobile terminal to the base station, a procedure for establishing uplink synchronization is needed before the data transmission.<br>
In contrast, when the uplink synchronization is maintained, such a procedure is not needed. Therefore, whether or not the uplink synchronization is maintained affects the throughput. Therefore, this variant offers an advantage of being able to provide further efficient achievement of low power consumption during Active (in a broad sense) (the state 2 of Fig. 13} according to the state of the mobile terminal, and an optimal reduction in the power consumption of the mobile terminal 3.<br>
The variant 2 can also be implemented by separately notifying both the parameter indicating "whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to the throughput (or whether<br><br>
the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption)" and a parameter indicating "whether the mobile terminal maintains the uplink synchronization" from the mobile terminal to the base station. [01461 Embodiment 4.<br>
In above-mentioned Embodiment 3, the example in which a parameter showing the result of determination of whether a mobile terminal 3 gives a higher priority to low power consumption is included in the mobile terminal capability information {UE Capabilities), and the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) is transmitted to a base station 2 is shown. As an alternative, the above-mentioned parameter can be transmitted to the base station 2 separately from the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) without the above-mentioned parameter being included in the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities). [0147]<br>
Every time when the above-mentioned parameter is changed or in a predetermined cycle even when the above-mentioned parameter is not changed, the mobile terminal 3 transmits the above-mentioned parameter to the base station 2.<br>
This Embodiment 4 offers an advantage of being able to notify the above-mentioned parameter without changing the functionality of the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities).<br>
The variants 1 and 2 of above-mentioned Embodiment 3 can also be applied to this Embodiment 4. [Q14B]<br><br>
Embodiment 5.<br>
Fig. 10 is a sequence diagram showing the description of processing carried out by a mobile communications system in accordance with Embodiment 5 of the present inventiofi.<br>
In above-mentioned Embodiment 3, the example in which the protocol processing unit 11 of a mobile terminal 3 determines whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption, a parameter showing the result of the determination is included in the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities), and the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) is then transmitted to a base station 2 is shown. The protocol processing unit 11 of the mobile terminal 3 can determine whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption with reference to the residue of a battery thereof-<br>
Concretely, this process is carried out as follows. [0149]<br>
First, the protocol processing unit 11 (or a control unit 23) of the mobile terminal 3 checks the battery residue (step<br>
I  ST51).<br>
The protocol processing unit 11 (or the control unit 23) of the mobile terminal 3 compares the battery residue with a predetermined threshold (a lower limit of the battery residue at which the mobile terminal has to give a higher priority to low power consumption) , and, when the battery residue is equal to or shorter than the predetermined threshold, determines that the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption (i.e., determines that the mobile terminal does not give a higher priority to the throughput) . In contrast, when the battery residue is greater than the predetermined threshold.<br><br>
the mobile terminal determines that the mobile terminal does not give a higher priority to low power consumption (i.e., determines that the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to the throughput} (step ST52). [0150]<br>
The protocol processing unit 11 (or Che control unit 23) of the mobile terminal 3 can alternatively determine whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption in consideration of whether or not the battery is under charge. This is because the mobile terminal can perform the operation of giving a higher priority to the throughput without caring about the battery residue when the battery is under charge.<br>
The predetermined threshold can be a specified value which is set up beforehand, or can be a value which is determined by a notification or calculation by an upper layer.<br>
Because the description of the processes of steps ST41 to ST46 is the same as those of above-mentioned Embodiment 3, the explanation of the description will be omitted.<br>
Like in the case of above-mentioned Embodiment 4, the parameter showing the result of the determination of whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption can be transmitted to the base station 2 separately from the mobile terminal capability information (UE Capabilities) without the above-mentioned parameter being included in the mobile terminal capability information {UE Capabilities). [0151]<br>
In this Embodiment 5, the example in which the mobile terminal 3 transmits the parameter showing the result of the<br><br>
determination of whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption to the base station 2 is shown. As an alternative, the mobile terminal 3 can transmit the battery residue to the base station 2, and. the base station. 2 can determine whether the mobile terminal gives a higher priority to low power consumption with reference to the battery residue. [0152]<br>
Fig. 11 is a sequence diagram showing the description of the processing carried out by the mobile communications system in accordance with Embodiment 5 of the present invention.<br>
The protocol processing unit 11 (or the control unit 23) of the mobile terminal 3 checks the battery residue (step ST51) .<br>
After checking the battery residue, the protocol processing unit 11 (or the control unit 23) of the mobile terminal 3 transmits the battery residue to the base station 2 (step ST61).<br>
As a concrete method of notifying the battery residue, there is, for example, a method of notifying the battery residue to the base station 2 by using a layer 3 message according to a protocol called TlRC (Radio Resource Control) . Furthermore, there are a method of mapping the battery residue onto a physical channel, a method of mapping the battery residue onto a MAC header as a MAC signaling, and the like. [0153]<br>
When  checking the battery residue,  the protocol<br>
processing unit 11 (or the control unit 23) of the mobile<br>
terminal 3 checks to see whether or not the battery is being<br>
charged, and, when the battery is being charged, can notify the<br>
)  battery residue to the base station 2 after assuming the battery<br><br>
residue to be a maximum (or to be infinite) . As an alternative, the mobile terminal can transmit a parameter indicating whether or not the battery is being charged to the base station 2 separately from the battery residue. As an alternative, the mobile terminal can transmit a parameter indicating whether or not the battery is being charged to the base station 2 without transmitting the battery residue. [0154]<br>
As the information which is transmitted to the base station 2, one of the following pieces of information (1) to (3) can be considered.<br>
(1)	An absolute value of the battery residue is<br>
transmitted.<br>
(2)	The ratio of the battery residue to the capacity of the battery is transmitted.<br>
(3)	An indicator is transmitted.<br>
In a case in which the indicator is transmitted, it is possible to reduce the amount of transmitted information as compared with a case in which either the absolute value of the battery residue or the ratio of the battery residue to the capacity of the battery is transmitted. Therefore, this is advantageous from the viewpoint of being aible to use the radio resources effectively. Fig. 12 is an explanatory drawing showing an example of the indicator. [0155]<br>
When receiving the battery residue from the mobile<br>
terminal 3 (step ST62) , the protocol processing unit 11 (or the<br>
control unit 23) of the mobile terminal 3 compares the battery<br>
residue with a predetermined threshold (a lower limit of the<br>
}  battery residue at which the mobile terminal has to give a higher<br><br><br><br>
