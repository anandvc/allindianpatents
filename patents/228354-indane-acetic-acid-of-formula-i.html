				<td>INDANE ACETIC ACID DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS PHARMACEUTICAL AGENTS. INTERMEDIATES. AND METHOD OF PREPARATION<br>
This application claims benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/308,500, filed July 27, 2001, and U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/373.048, filed on April 16, 2002, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to indane acetic acid derivatives and their use in pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of diseases such as diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerotic disease. The invention is also directed to intermediates useful in preparation of indane acetic derivatives and to methods of preparation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Type II diabetes is the more common form of diabetes, with 90-95% of hyperglycemic patients experiencing this form of the disease. In Type II diabetes, there appears to be a reduction in the pancreatic p-cell mass, several distinct defects in insulin secretion, and a decrease in tissue sensitivity to insulin. The symptoms and consequences of this form of diabetes include fatigue, frequent urination, thirst, blurred vision, frequent infections and slow healing of sores, diabetic nerve damage, retinopathy, micro and macro blood vessel damage, and heart and renal disease.<br>
Resistance to the metabolic actions of insulin is one of the key features of Type II diabetes. Insulin resistance is characterized by impaired uptake and utilization of glucose in insulin-sensitive target organs, for example, adipocytes and skeletal muscle, and by impaired inhibition of hepatic glucose output. Functional insulin deficiency, insulin resistance in the periphery, and the failure of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose output results in fasting hyperglycemia. Pancreatic p-cells compensate for the insulin resistance by secreting increased levels of insulin. However, the p-cells are unable to maintain this high output of insulin, and eventually, the glucose-induced insulin secretion falls, leading to the deterioration of glucose homeostasis and to the subsequent development of overt diabetes. Hyperinsulinemia is also linked to insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased plasma concentration of low-density lipoproteins (LDL). The association of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia<br><br>
with these metabolic disorders has been termed "Syndrome X," and has been strongly linked to an increased risk of hypertension and coronary artery disease.<br>
Obesity is an excessive accumulation of adipose tissue. Excess adipose tissue is associated with the development of serious medical conditions, for example, Type II diabetes, hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and certain malignancies. The adipocyte may also influence glucose homeostasis through the production of tumor necrosis factor a (TNFa) and other molecules.<br>
Atherosclerotic disease is known to be caused by a number of factors, for example, hypertension, diabetes, low levels of HDL, and high levels of LDL. Atherosclerotic-related diseases include cardiovascular disease, coronary heart disease (CHD), cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vessel disease. Coronary 'heart disease includes CHD death, myocardial infarction, and coronary revascularization. Cerebrovascular disease includes ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and transient ischemic attacks.<br>
Accordingly, despite the presence of some Pharmaceuticals that are used to treat these diseases, there remains a need for new Pharmaceuticals that are both safe and effective agents for the treatment of disease, and for useful methods to prepare them.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds which are useful in the treatment of diabetes and related disorders such as Syndrome X, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and hyperinsulinemia; obesity; atherosclerotic disease, dyslipidemia, and related disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol, and hypercholesteremia; cardiovascular disease; and cerebrovascular disease.<br>

The terms identified above have the following meaning throughout: "CrC6 alky!" means straight or branched chain alkyl groups having from one to about six carbon atoms. Such groups include methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, terf-butyl, n-pentyl,-neo-pentyl, 2-pentyl, n-hexyl, 2-hexyl, 3-hexyl, 2,3-dimethylbutyl, and the like.<br>

When an alkyl, cycloalkyl, alkenyl, or alkoxy group is described as being substituted with fluoro, it may be substituted with one or more fluorine atoms at any available carbon atom up to the perfluoro level,<br>
When an alkyl substituent is described as being substituted by oxo, it means substitution by a doubly bonded oxygen atom, which forms together with the carbon to which it is attached, a carbonyl group -(C=O)-.<br>
When any moiety is described as being substituted, it can have one or more of the indicated substituents that may be located at any available position on the moiety. When there are two or more substituents on any moiety, each substituent may be defined independently of any other substituent and may, accordingly, be the same or different.<br>
The term "optionally substituted" means that the moiety so modified may be unsubstituted or substituted with the identified substituent(s).<br>
R3 may be attached to the heterocyclic moiety of the compound of Formula I at either the 4 or 5 position (i.e., at either available carbon atom) and, accordingly, the remaining portion of the molecule will be attached at the remaining available carbon atom.<br>
Examples of the compounds of Formula I, which are illustrative of the present invention but not limiting in any way, are listed in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Illustrative Examples of Compounds of Formula I<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
A salt of a compound of Formula I may be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of a compound or by separately reacting the purified compound in its free base form with a suitable organic or inorganic acid and isolating the salt thus formed. Likewise, when the compound of Formula I contains a carboxylic acid moiety, (e.g., R = H), a salt of said compound of Formula I may be prepared by separately reacting it with a suitable inorganic or organic base and isolating the salt thus formed. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to a relatively non-toxic, inorganic or organic acid addition salt of a compound of the present invention (see, e.g., Berge et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 66:1-19, 1977).<br>
Representative salts of the compounds of Formula I include the conventional non-toxic salts and the quaternary ammonium salts which are formed, for example, from inorganic or organic acids or bases by means well known in the art. For example, such acid addition salts include acetate, adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzoate, benzenesulfonate, bisulfate, butyrate, citrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, cinnamate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate, dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, fumarate, glucoheptanoate, glycerophosphate, hemisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydrochloride,<br><br>
hydrobromide, hydroiodide, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, itaconate, lactate, maleate, mandelate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, succinate, sulfonate, tartrate, thiocyanate, tosylate, undecanoate, and the like.<br>
Base salts include, for example, alkali metal salts such as potassium and sodium salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magnesium salts, and ammonium salts with organic bases such as dicyclohexylamine and N-methyl-D-glucamine. Additionally, basic nitrogen containing groups in the conjugate base may be quaternized with such agents as lower alkyl halides such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, and butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; dialkyl sulfates like dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl suKate; and diamyl sulfates, long chain halides such as decyl, lauryl, myristyl and strearyl chlorides, bromides and iodides; aralkyl halides like benzyl and phenethyl bromides, and the like.<br>
The esters of Formula I in the present invention are non-toxic, pharmaceutically acceptable esters, for example, alkyl esters such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, or pentyl esters. Additional esters such as, for example, methyl ester or phenyl-Ci-C5 alkyl may be used. The compound of Formula I may be esterified by a variety of conventional procedures including reacting the appropriate anhydride, carboxylic acid, or acid chloride with the alcohol group of the Formula I compound. The appropriate anhydride may be reacted with the alcohol in the presence of a base to facilitate acylation such as 1,8-bis[dimethylamino]naphthalene or N,N-dimethylaminopyridine. An appropriate carboxylic acid may be reacted with the alcohol in the presence of a dehydrating agent such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, 1-[3-dimethylaminopropyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide, or other water soluble dehydrating agents which are used to drive the reaction by the removal of water, and optionally, an acylation catalyst. Esterification may also be effected using the appropriate carboxylic acid in the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride and optionally, pyridine, or in the presence of N,N-carbonyldiimidazole with pyridine. Reaction of an acid chloride with the alcohol may be carried out with an acylation catalyst such as 4-DMAP or pyridine.<br>
One skilled in the art would readily know how to successfully carry out these as well as other methods of esterification of alcohols.<br>
Additionally, sensitive or reactive groups on the compound of Formula I may need to be protected and deprotected during any of the above methods for forming esters. Protecting groups in general may be added and removed by conventional methods well known in the art (see, e.g., T. W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis; Wiley: New York, (1999)).<br><br>
The compounds of Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers, depending upon the location and nature of the various substituents desired. Asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in the (R) or (S) configuration. Preferred isomers are those with the absolute configuration which produces the compound of Formula I with the more desirable biological activity. In certain instances, asymmetry may also be present due to restricted rotation about a given bond, for example, the central bond adjoining two aromatic rings of the specified compounds.<br>
Substituents on a ring may also be present in either cis or trans form, and a substituent on a double bond may be present in either Z or £ form.<br>
It is intended that all isomers (including enantiomers and diastereomers), either by nature of asymmetric centers or by restricted rotation as described above, as, separated, pure or partially purified isomers or racemic mixtures thereof, be included within the scope of the instant invention. The purification of said isomers and the separation of said isomeric mixtures may be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art.<br>
The particular process to be utilized in the preparation of the compounds of this invention depends upon the specific compound desired. Such factors as the selection of the specific X moiety, and the specific substituents possible at various locations on the molecule, all play a role in the path to be followed in the preparation of the specific compounds of this invention. Those factors are readily recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
In general, the compounds of this invention may be prepared by standard techniques known in the art and by known processes analogous thereto. The compounds of Formula I may generally be synthesized according to Reaction Schemes 1, 2, and 3. Reaction Schemes 1 and 2 demonstrate how to make intermediates that are coupled in Reaction Scheme 3 to provide the compounds of Formula I.<br>
Route (A) of Reaction Scheme 1 provides a method to prepare compounds 4 and 5 where R" is CrC6 lower alkyl or benzyl, R3 is not hydrogen, and X is O. The first step shows protection of the acid group of a commercially available aspartate derivative compound 1 by means well known in the art such as, for example, by forming a silyl ester, followed by N-acylation with the appropriate R4-acid derivative, R4COY, where Y is a leaving group such as halo. Finally, the compound is deprotected by means well known in the art such as, for example, in the case of a silyl ester, an aqueous work up, to give compound 2.   Alternatively, condensation of the protected form of compound 1 with a free carboxylic acid such as R4COOH in the presence of a dehydrating reagent, such as DCC or EDCI, also provides compound 2. Compound 2 may then be converted to compound 3, where R3 is as defined for Formula I compounds by several methods. For<br><br>
example, one such method, when R3 = Me, is the well known Dakin-West reaction which is typically performed using acetic anhydride and pyridine. When R3 is other than hydrogen, compound 2 may be converted to an acid chloride with a reagent such as thionyl chloride and reacted with a Grignard reagent such as R3Mg-halo, to provide compound 3. Other methods for the formation of ketones of compound 3 from acids and acid derivatives may also be employed, for example, by using Weinreb amides, which are known to those skilled in the art. Compound 3 is then cyclized under acid dehydrative conditions using, for example, phosphorus oxychloride, or a mixture of sulfuric acid and acetic anhydride, generally with heating, to provide compound 4 where X is O and the R3 group is attached at the 5 position.<br>
It will be recognized by those skilled in the art that compound 4 and thus, compound 5, may exist in two regioisomeric forms with respect to the attachment point of the R3, CH2CO2R", and CH2CH2OH groups. Using Route (B), one can prepare compound 4 in which the R3 is attached at the 4-position and carboxymethyl side chain is attached at the 5-position, that is, the groups are reversed from that of Route (A). In Route (B), a commercially available amino acid, compound 6, may be acylated under basic conditions, for example, with aqueous sodium hydroxide, with an appropriate R4-aoid derivative, (e.g., R4COY), where Y is a leaving group such as chloro, to provide the N-acylated product 7. Compound 7 may be then coupled with an acetic acid ester in the presence of a strong non-nucleophilic base to make the keto ester 8, where R" is CrC6 alkyl or benzyl. Cyclization of compound 8 using a dehydrating reagent such as POCI3 provides compound 4 where X = O and R3 is attached at the 4 position. Reaction of compound 8 with a nucleophilic S reagent such as P2S5 in solvents such as pyridine or acetonitrile/triethylamine, with heating as necessary, gives compound 4 where X = S and R3 is attached at the 4 position.<br>
Route (C) of Reaction Scheme 1 depicts the preparation of compound 4 from ketoesters 9 or 10, where Y is a leaving group such as halo and R" is CrC6 alkyl or benzyl. Either compound 9 or 10 may be chosen as the starting material depending on whether the R3 group in the desired end product is hydrogen or is attached at the 4 or 5 position.   Accordingly, compound 9 or 10 may be reacted with an amide or thioamide where X is either O or S to yield compound 4. Ketoesters 9 or 10 are commercially available, or may be prepared by methods well known in the art such as by bromination of commercially available ketoesters 9 and 10 where Y is hydrogen. Amides (R4C(=X)NH2) where X is O may be commercially available carboxylic amides, or may be prepared from the corresponding available acids or acid chlorides by well known methods. Thioamides (R4C(=X)NH2) where X is S may be commercially available thioamides, or may be<br><br>
prepared from the corresponding available amides by known methods such as through the use of Lawesson's reagent. Reaction of ketoester 9 with an amide or thioamide in the presence of a base provides compound 4 as an oxazole or a thiazole,, respectively, where R3 is other than hydrogen and located at the 4-position. Reaction of ketoester 10 with an amide or thioamide in the presence of base provides compound 4 as an oxazole or thiazole, where R3 is located at the 5-position.<br>
Routes (A), (B), and (C) each provide compound 4 where R3 and R4 are each as described for a compound of Formula I and where R" is a lower alkyl or benzyl. Compound 4 may then be reduced to compound 5 using reducing agents such as lithium aluminum hydride, lithium borohydride, or other suitable hydride donors under conditions well known in the art.<br>

Reaction Scheme 2 depicts the conversion of commercially available hydroxy<br>
ketone 11 to a protected derivative 12, by reaction with R7-Y in the presence of a base,<br>
where R7 is CrC6 alkyl optionally substituted with phenyl or oxo, CrC6 trialkylsilyl, arylalkylsilyl, or COR8; and R8 is CrC6 alkyl or phenyl optionally substituted with CrC6 alkyl, halo, or nitro; and Y is a leaving group. "CrC6 trialkylsilyl" means three independently selected straight or branched chain alkyl groups having from one to about six carbon atoms, each of which are bound to silicon and includes such groups as trimethylsilyl, terf-butyldimethyl silyl, and the like. "Arylalkylsilyl" means at least one phenyl or substituted phenyl group bound to silicon, with an appropriate number of independently selected straight or branched chain alkyl groups having from one to about six carbon atoms, each of which are also bound to silicon, and includes such groups as t-butyldiphenylsilyl methyldiphenylsilyl, dimethylpentafluorophenylsilyl, and the like. "Leaving group" includes halides such as I, Br, and Cl; carboxylates such as acetates, and trifluoroacetates; and aryl and alkyl sulfonates such as methanesulfonates (mesylates) and p-toluene sulfonates (tosylates), and the like.<br>
Compound 12 is substituted with R2(as described in Formula I) by means of, for example, reaction with a source of electrophilic halogen, or a Fried el-Crafts reaction in the presence of a Lewis acid and R2-Y where Y is as described above, to form a substituted ketone 13. Alternatively, a halogenated compound formed in this manner (for example, substituted with bromine or iodine) may be reacted with a range of coupling partners under metal catalysis, using complexes and compounds of elements such as palladium and nickel well known to those skilled in the art, to form further substituted ketone 13. Examples of such catalysts include tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and [1,1'-bis(diphenyiphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladiurn(ll), and similar nickel(O) and nickel(ll) compounds; and examples of coupling partners include boronic acids and esters (the well known Suzuki coupling, carried out in solvents such as toluene in the presence of a base such as potassium carbonate), and organometallics such as Grignard reagents, organozincs (Negishi coupling), and organotin derivatives (Stille coupling), reaction conditions for which are widely known. Furthermore, such halogenated compounds may be coupled with secondary amines such as piperidine using similar palladium or nickel catalysts (Hartwig or Buchwald coupling) to provide further substituted ketones 13.<br>
Further reaction of compound 13 with a halogen source or R5-Y, (where R5 is as described in Formula I), under similar conditions gives disubstituted compound 14. A Wittig reaction, or the Horner-Emmons-Wadsworth variation, each well known in the art, may be used to convert 14 to compound 15. For example, reaction of compound 14 with a trialkylphosphonoacetate, where R" is lower alkyl and R is as described in Formula I, in the presence of a strong base such as sodium hydride, provides compound 15. In like manner, compound 13 may be converted to compound 15 where R° is H.<br>
Regardless of the isomeric mixture of isomers of 15 produced in the reaction, either isomer (E or Z) or a mixture of both, may be converted to the corresponding compound 17 by catalytic hydrogenation or reduction with a hydride reagent capable of 1,4 (conjugate) addition, which are known to those skilled in the art. This route is particularly advantageous for preparing compound 17 where R1 is hydrogen. Compound 17 where R1 is COOR, may be prepared through standard condensation reactions, for example, the well known Knoevenagel reaction. In such cases, the ketone 13 or 14 may be reacted with a suitable active-hydrogen coupling partner, under the influence of acidic reagents such as titanium tetrachloride, or basic reagents such as piperidine, in appropriate solvents. The product 15b (compound 15 where R1 is COOR), may be reduced to 17b (compound 17 where R1 is COOR), which may be further alkylated with another R1 group in the presence of base, hydrolyzed and decarboxylated to give 17d (compound 17 where R1 is other than COOH and R is H). Reesterification of 17d and removal of the protecting group R7 would afford 17c. Reesterification may be performed using standard conditions using the well known Fischer esteriflcation by treatment with an acid and an alcohol or by reaction with diazoalkyl reagents or with an electrophilic species such as, for example, methyl iodide or dimethyl sulfate. Compound 17 where R1 is alkoxy may be prepared by a similar condensation reaction of ketone 13 or 14 with a silylated enoi ester of Formula R1CH=C(OR")0-alkylsilyl, where R1 is alkoxy, under the influence of acidic reagents such as titanium tetrachloride, and reducing the intermediate compound 15, where R1 is alkoxy, in the presence of hydrogen and a catalyst as described above.<br>
A general coupling reaction of compound 13 or 14 via the Reformatsky reaction produces compound 16 (Formula II), when R1 is alkyl, or compound 15a when R1 is H. The ketone is condensed with an appropriate organozinc reagent prepared in situ from Zn and R1CHYC02R, where Y is halo. The alpha-halo ester compounds of formula R1CHYCO2R, are either commercial reagents or are prepared by halpgenation of commercially available R1CH2CO2R compounds by methods well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The conversion of 16 to 17 may be accomplished by standard hydrogenation conditions, for example, Pd/C and hydrogen; and deprotection of compound 17, where R7 is a protecting group, to compound 17c, where R7 is hydrogen, may be accomplished by standard means. For example, when the R7 group is alkyl (e.g., methyl), the compound 17a may be generated by nucleophilic cleavage with a reagent such as an alkali metal thiolate. Alternatively, compound 17 when R7 is methyl, may be converted to compound 17c by reaction with a Lewis acid such as a bromoborane. When R7is benzyl, the<br>
compound 17 may be converted to 17c under hydrogenation conditions, typically carried out using a catalyst such as palladium. Other conditions for the removal of the protecting group R7 from compound 17, where R7 is other than hydrogen which produces the hydroxy compound 17c, are dependent on the specific protecting group chosen from among those which are well known by those skilled in the art.<br>
The final step in the preparation of Formula I compounds is shown in Reaction<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
 Scheme 3. The alcohol 5 (from Reaction Scheme 1) is coupled with the hydroxy indane 17c (from Reaction Scheme 2) via a Mitsunobu coupling, facilitated by an azodicarboxylate reagent such as DEAD, and a phosphine such as triphenylphosphine to make the compounds of Formula I. Alternatively, the hydroxy group of alcohol 5 is converted to a leaving group such as halo, tosylate (OTs), or mesylate (OMs), by reaction with a halogenating agent such as thionyl chloride or CCI^/triphenylphosphine; or by reaction with a Y-halo compound, where Y is tosyl (Ts) or mesyl (Ms), in the presence of a base, providing compound 18. Compound 18 may be reacted with compound 17c in the presence of a base, providing the compounds of Formula I.<br>
Compounds of Formula I in which R is alkyl, may be converted to compounds of Formula I in which R is H by treatment with a base (e.g., KOH) in a suitable solvent (e.g., methanol, THF, or water, or mixtures thereof) with heating. Alternatively, this conversion may be accomplished by reaction with a nucleophile such as iodide or cyanide, in a suitable solvent, such as pyridine. In addition, when R is benzyl, the cleavage to compounds of Formula I in which R is H may be effected through hydrogenolysis by means well known in the art.<br>
Reaction Scheme 3<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
An alternative route to Formula I compounds, useful when X = S and the R4 group contains one or more R6 substituents labile to the reaction conditions of Scheme 1 or 2, is shown in Reaction Scheme 3a.<br>
Reaction Scheme 3a<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
In Scheme 3a, a 2-aminothiazole 4 may be prepared using thiourea (similar to Route C, Reaction Scheme 1) and converted to a 2-halo thiazole 5a as shown above (Erlenmeyer et al., Helv. Chim. Acta 28:362-363, 1945). Mitsunobu coupling of 5a by a method analogous to Reaction Scheme 3 is then accomplished, and product 19 is further elaborated by a Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction to introduce the R4<br>
substituent. Hydrolysis as described in Reaction Scheme 3 gives Formula I compounds where R = H.<br>
The foregoing reaction schemes are further illustrated by the specific Examples described herein.<br>
The salts and esters of this invention may be readily prepared by conventional chemical processes as described previously herein.<br>
The invention is further directed to novel Formula II compounds (compound 16) and Formula III (compounds 17, including compounds 17a-d) compounds shown in Reaction Scheme 2. These compounds are useful in the preparation of the compounds of Formula I, and are further described as follows.<br>
The present invention encompasses the compounds of Formula II and Formula III<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R, R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, and X are as defined for Formula I above; and R7 is H, Ci-C6alkyl optionally substituted with phenyl or oxo, CrC6 trialkylsilyl, arylalkylsilyl, COR8. COOR8, or R3<br>
R8 is Ci-C6 alkyl, or phenyl optionally substituted with CrC6 alkyl, halo, or nitro; and the salts thereof.<br>
C-i-Ce trialkylsilyl means three independently selected straight or branched chain alkyl groups having from one to about six carbon atoms, each of which are bound to silicon and includes such groups as trimethylsilyl, ferf-butyldimethyl silyl, and the like.<br>
Arylalkylsilyl means at least one phenyl or substituted phenyl group bound to silicon, with an appropriate number of independently selected straight or branched chain alky| groups having from one to about six carbon atoms, each of which are also bound to silicon, and includes such groups as t-butyldiphenylsilyl methyldiphenylsilyl, dimethylpentafluorophenylsilyl, and the like.<br><br>
The salts of this invention may be readily prepared by conventional chemical processes as described previously herein.<br>
The compounds of Formula II and Formula III may each contain one or more asymmetric centers, depending upon the location and nature of the various substituents desired. Asymmetric carbon atoms may be present in the (R) or (S) configuration. Preferred isomers are those with the absolute configuration which produces the compound of Formula II or Formula III that will be useful in producing the compounds of Formula I having a more desirable biological activity. In certain instances, asymmetry may also be present due to restricted rotation about a given bond, for example, the central bond adjoining two aromatic rings of the specified compounds.<br>
Substituents on a ring may also be present in either cis or trans form, and a substituent on a double bond may be present in either Z or E form.<br>
It is intended that all isomers (including enantiomers and diastereomers), either by nature of asymmetric centers or by restricted rotation as described above, as separated, pure or partially purified isomers or racemic mixtures thereof, be included within the scope of the present invention. The purification of said isonners and the separation of said isomeric mixtures may be accomplished by standard techniques known in the art, as well as by the novel means described herein.<br>
For example, Formula II compounds may contain an asymmetric center (labeled C-2) and Formula III compounds may contain two asymmetric centers (labeled C-2 and C-11) which give rise to enantiomers and diastereomers. Examples of these and other compounds of Formula II and Formula III, which are illustrative of the present invention, are shown in Table 2.<br>

Another embodiment of the present invention is an improved process for the preparation of compounds having a specific isomeric configuration when that specific configuration is desired for the ultimate desired end product of Formula I. The improved process yields these intermediate compounds in significantly greater diastereomeric excess than was heretofore possible.<br>
Previously, for example, in the absence of stereocontr ol during the hydrogenation step of Reaction Scheme 2, hydrogenation of a Formula II compound, where R1 is alky! may produce an unequal mixture of diastereomeric products of Formula III, in which one pair of enantiomers is favored because of the asymmetric nature of the starting material. Separation of such compounds may be accomplished by stepwise separation of the enantiomeric pairs, then by resolution of each enantiomer by crystallization or by chiral HPLC. Prior resolution of the starting material into a single enantiomer produces mixtures with enrichment of a single enantiomer that may likewise be separated.<br>
However, when a compound of a specific relative configuration, namely a syn form (defined below) is desired, the yield is low when R1 is alkyl, because the conditions of the hydrogenation step described in the art may favor the other (i.e., anti) diastereomers.<br>
The desired isomeric configurations realized from this improved process are in the syn form where, for example, in compounds of Formula Va and Vb (depicted in Reaction Schemes 4 and 5), the R9 group and the 2' methylene carbon of the cyclopentane ring are both below the plane or are both above the plane. Anti diastereomers are those compounds where, for example, R9 is above the plane and 2' methylene is below the plane. This is further exemplified in Figures 1 and 2 below, in which solid wedge bonds are used to indicate projection of the bond above the plane and dashed wedge bonds are used to indicate projection of the bond below the plane.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
The improved process of this invention yields compounds in the syn form (Formulas Va and Vb, as drawn in Figure 1 and Reaction Schemes 4 and 5) in significantly higher diastereomeric excess than was generally possible.<br>
The intermediate compounds used as starting materials for this process (compound IV of Reaction Schemes 4 and 5) are related to the compounds of Formula II (compound 16) in Reaction Scheme 2, and may be prepared by the same or analogous methods. These intermediates may be reacted under certain conditions to yield Formula V compounds that are related to compounds of Formula III (compounds 17 and 17a of Reaction Scheme 2), or to directly yield compounds of Formula I. However, due to the constraints of the improved process, only certain substituents are appropriate for completing this process.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invntion relates to an improved process for the (Figure Removed)<br><br>
preparation of a substantially enriched syn form of a compound of Formula V,<br>

comprising hydrogenation of a racemic mixture or isolated optical isomer of a compound of Formula IV,<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein the substituents are as defined above, in the presence of hydrogen source, a catalyst, optionally in the presence of a base.<br>
Substantially enriched syn form means at least about seventy percent (70%) or greater of one or both of the compounds of the configuration of Va or Vb. This is equivalent to at least about 40% de (diastereomeric excess) of the syn diastereomer. Diastereomeric excess of the syn diastereomer is calculated from the following formula:<br>
[syn] - [anti]<br>
% de (syn) =	   x 100   =  % syn diastereomer -% anti diastereomer<br>
[syn] + [anti]<br>
in which<br>
% de (syn) represents the diastereomeric excess of the syn diastereomer<br>
[syn] represents the concentration of the syn diastereomer<br>
[anti] represents the concentration of the anti diastereomer,<br>
and where<br>
% syn + % anti = 100%.<br>
Thus, a 40% de of the syn diastereomer is calculated from a mixture of 70% syn diastereomer and 30% anti diastereomer:<br>
40% de (syn) = 70 % syn diastereomer - 30% anti diastereomer<br>
Catalyst means any of the transition metal catalysts well known in the art to effect hydrogenation reactions (P.A. Chaloner, Handbook of Co-ordination Catalysis in Organic Chemistry, Butterworth, 1986), and includes homogeneous hydrogenation catalysts. A homogeneous catalyst is a catalyst which is at least partially soluble in the reaction medium and which effects the reduction of a double bond in the presence of hydrogen. Such catalysts include, for example, CIRh[P(Ph)3]3(Wilkinson's catalyst), (1,5-<br><br>
cyclooctadiene)tricyclohexylphosphinepyridinoiridium(l) hexafluorophosphate, (1,5-cyclooctadiene)bis(methyldiphenylphosphine)iridium(l) hexafluorophosphate (Crabtree's catalysts), and the like.<br>
Base means a substance with a pKb sufficient to form a salt in situ with a carboxylic acid (see, e.g., Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed., Jerry March, pp 220-222). The base which is used in this reaction may be any inorganic or organic base, and may be soluble in the reaction medium. Such bases include, for example, mono, di, and tri(Ci-C6alkyl)amines such as isopropyl amine, diisopropyl amine, triethylamine, and the like; additional primary amines such as, for example, cyclohexane methylamine and ethanolamine; additional secondary amines such as, for example, morpholine and piperidine; and additional tertiary amines such as, for example, 1,8-diazaobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene and 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene as well as inorganic bases such as alkali metal and alkaline earth hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and optically active bases such as quinine, cinchonine or (+)- or (-)-alpha-methylbenzylamine.<br>
Such bases also include, for example, the chiral bases named below that are useful for resolution.<br>
Hydrogen source refers to any means of delivering hydrogen to the reaction medium and includes the use of hydrogen gas. Hydrogenation may by performed under a broad range of hydrogen pressures, that is, from about atmospheric pressure to about 1000 psi, preferably from about 20 to about 100 psi. Suitable hydrogenation solvents include, but are not limited to, protic solvents such as ethanol, methanol, water, 2-proponal, terf-butanol, methyl cellosolve and the like, and mixtures thereof, or optionally mixtures thereof with a miscible aprotic solvent such as THF, such that the hydrogenation catalyst, the base, and the starting material are each at least partially soluble.<br>
The resolution of the starting indene acetic acid derivatives of Formula IV or of the indane acetic acid derivatives of Formula V may be accomplished by means well known in the art, for example, by using optically active bases as resolving agents such as, for example, a readily available base such as quinine, cinchonine or (+)- or (-)-alpha-methylbenzylamine. Choice of the base will depend on the solubility properties of the salt formed, so that resolution by differential recrystallization may be readily accomplished. By selecting bases with opposite absolute configuration, separation of the salt of each enantiomer may be accomplished. For example, for the embodiment illustrated in Reaction Scheme 4, the desired enantiomer IVc or IVd may be separated, and the undesired isomer may be recycled by racemization under basic conditions to the starting material of Formula IV.<br><br>
Suitable crystallization solvents refer to those solvents in which one diastereomeric salt of a mixture is more soluble than the other, enabling them to be separated by recrystallization. Such solvents include, for example, acetonitrile, acetone, f-butanol, 2-propanol, ethanol, methanol, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Aqueous mineral acids include, for example, the commonly used inorganic acids such as hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, and the like.<br>
The process may be carried out starting with a racemate of Formula IV (see Reaction Scheme 4), or with a Formula V compound with the configuration at one asymmetric carbon which corresponds to that desired for the end product (see Reaction Scheme 5). Starting with the generally pure configuration is preferred, although either process will yield the desired configuration of the end product (V) in substantially enriched syn form.<br>
One embodiment of this process is shown in the example of Reaction Scheme 4 and comprises the steps of<br>
(1)	formation of diastereomeric salts of IVc and IVd by treatment of IV with a<br>
suitable basic resolving agent,<br>
(2)	separation of the diastereomeric salts IVc and IVd by crystallization in a<br>
suitable crystallization solvent,<br>
(3)	optionally liberating the individual antipodes IVa and IVb from the separated<br>
salts by treatment with aqueous mineral acid, and<br>
(4)	reduction of either the separated diastereomeric salts IVc and Vd or the<br>
individual antipodes IVa and IVb by hydrogenation in the presence of a<br>
homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst, a suitable solvent and a base, wherein<br>
M+ is a cation selected from an alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium,<br>
and mono-, di-, tri- or quaternary alkylammonium or aralkylammonium, and R9-<br>
R12 are as defined above.<br>
The enantiomeric purity of the product Va and Vb will correspond to the enantiomeric purity of the isomer IVa or IVb used, respectively, but will not include any substantial amount of the other (anti) diastereoisomer.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
A second embodiment of this process is shown in Reaction Scheme 5 and comprises the steps of<br>
(1)	reduction of the indene carboxylic acid of Formula IV by hydrogenation in the<br>
presence of a homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst, a suitable solvent, and a<br>
base,<br>
(2)	formation of diastereomeric salts of Vc and Vd by treatment of V with a<br>
suitable basic resolving agent,<br>
(3)	separation of the diastereomeric salts Vc and Vd by crystallization in a suitable<br>
crystallization solvent, and<br>
(4)	liberating the individual antipodes Va and Vb from the separated salts by<br>
treatment with aqueous mineral acid.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
The resolution of the racemate of either Formula IV or Formula V compounds may be accomplished by means well known in the art, such as by chiral HPLC, crystallization of chiral salt derivatives, chiral ester derivatives, and the like.<br>
The determination of absolute chirality of IVa, IVb, IVc, IVd, Va, and Vb may be accomplished by several means known to those skilled in the art. X-ray crystallographic<br>
methods may provide such information under certain well-established conditions. For example, the presence in the crystallographic unit cell of another component of known chirality, such as a chiral resolving agent or auxiliary in the form of a salt, complex, or covalently attached group, may allow such determination. Another method known in the art, heavy atom scattering technique may be utilized when the compound to be assayed contains an atom of sufficient mass (for example, bromine or iodine). Other methods involving optical properties and the use of plane-polarized light may also be employed. For example, one skilled in the art would recognize that such techniques as circular dichroism may be applicable to a given structure or structural class.<br>
Specific examples of the intermediates that may be made with the process of the present invention are shown below by way of example, and not by way of limitation, and may be used for the preparation of compounds of Formula I of the same absolute configuration.<br><br>

Compounds of Formula III in which R1 = H may also be prepared in an optically active fashion by the methods summarized in Reaction Scheme 6. Resolution of racemic ester 17a (Formula III, where R1 is H) may be accomplished by selective enzymatic hydrolysis using Amano Lipase PS to yield 17f. Alternatively, 17e, which may be prepared by hydrolysis of 17a, may be resolved by crystallization of the diastereomeric salts formed with an optically active amine, for example, (S)-(-)-a-methyl-benzylamine, followed by regeneration of the carboxylic acid by treating the salt with mineral acid. Further conversion of 17f to the intermediates 17g and 17h may be accomplished by means analogous to that described for the preparation of 17c in Reaction Scheme 2: reesterification and removal of the R7 protecting group.<br>

The compounds of Formula I are effective in the treatment of Type II diabetes mellitus (including associated diabetic dyslipidemia and other diabetic complications), as well as for a number of other pharmaceutical uses associated therewith, such as hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, dyslipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, Syndrome X, and insulin resistance. In addition, the compounds of the present invention are also effective in the regulation of appetite and food intake in such disorders as obesity, and in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesteremia, low HDL levels, hypertension, cardiovascular disease (including atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, coronary artery disease, and hypertension), cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vessel disease; and for the treatment of lupus, polycystic ovary syndrome, carcinogenesis, and hyperplasia. The compounds of Formula I are also useful for treating physiological disorders related to, for example, cell differentiation to produce lipid accumulating cells, regulation of insulin sensitivity and blood glucose levels, which are involved in, for example, abnormal pancreatic beta cell function, insulin secreting tumors and/or autoimmune hypoglycemia due to autoantibodies to insulin, autoantibodies to the insulin receptor, or autoantibodies that are stimulatory to pancreatic beta cells), macrophage differentiation which leads to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques, inflammatory response, carcinogenesis, hyperplasia, adipocyte gene expression, adipocyte differentiation, reduction in the pancreatic p-cell mass, insulin secretion, tissue sensitivity to insulin, liposarcoma cell growth, polycystic ovarian disease, chronic anovulation, hyperandrogenism, progesterone production, steroidogenesis, redox potential and oxidative stress in cells, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) production, increased gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, catalase, plasma triglycerides, HDL, and LDL cholesterol levels, and the like.<br>
Particularly useful compounds of Formula I of the present invention are those with efficacy in lowering blood glucose concentration and serum triglyceride levels, and raising serum HDL cholesterol levels.<br>
Therefore, the compounds of Formula I of this invention are expected to be valuable as therapeutic agents. Accordingly, an embodiment of this invention includes a method of treating the various conditions identified above in a patient (including mammals) which comprises administering to said patient a composition containing an amount of the compound of Formula I that is effective in treating the target condition.<br>
As indicated above, a compound of Formula I may be administered alone or in combination with one or more additional hypoglycemic agents. Combination therapy includes administration of a single pharmaceutical dosage formulation which contains a<br>
compound of Formula I and one or more additional hypoglycemic agent, as well as<br>
administration of the compound of Formula I and each additional hypoglycemic agents in its own separate pharmaceutical dosage formulation. For example, a compound of Formula I and hypoglycemic agent may be administered to the patient together in a single oral dosage composition such as a tablet or capsule, or each agent may be administered in separate oral dosage formulations.<br>
Where separate dosage formulations are used, the compound of Formula I and one or more additional hypoglycemic agents may be administered at essentially the same time (e.g., concurrently) or at separately staggered times (e.g., sequentially).<br>
For example, the compound of Formula I may be administered in combination with one or more of the following additional hypoglycemic agents: insulin; biguanidines such as metformin or buformin; sulfonylureas such as acetohexamide, chloropropamide, tolazamide, tolbutamide, glyburide, glipizide, glyclazide; or any other insulin secretagogue such as, for example, repaglinide and nateglinide; a-glycosidase inhibitors such as acarbose, voglibose, or miglitol; or p3-adrenoreceptor agonists such as CL-316,243.<br>
The compounds of Formula I may also be utilized, in free base form or in compositions, as well as in research and diagnostics or as analytical reference standards, and the like, which are well known in the art. Therefore, the present invention includes compositions which are comprised of an inert carrier and an effective amount of a compound of Formula I, or a salt, or ester thereof. An inert carrier is any material which does not interact with the compound to be carried and which lends support, means of conveyance, bulk, traceable material, and the like to the compound to be carried. An effective amount of the compound is that amount which produces a result or exerts an influence on the particular procedure being performed.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for treating a disease state in a patient, wherein the disease is associated with a physiological detrimental level of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), cholesterol, or triglycerides in the blood, comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of Formula I. In a further embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating a disease state in a patient, wherein the disease is associated with a physiological detrimental level of insulin, glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), or triglycerides in the blood, comprising administering to the patient a therapeutically effeqtive amount of a compound of Formula I and also administering a therapeutically effective amount of an additional hypoglycemic agent such as, for example, insulin, a biguanidine compound, and the like.<br>
Since sulfonylureas and other insulin secretagogues are known to be capable of stimulating insulin release, but are not capable of acting on insulin resistance, and<br>
compounds of Formula I are able to act on insulin resistance, it is envisaged that a combination of these medicaments may be used as a remedy for conditions associated with both deficiency in insulin secretion and insulin resistance. Therefore, the invention also provides a method of treating Type II diabetes mellitus in a patient comprising administering a compound of Formula I and one or more additional hypoglycemic agents such as, for example, sulfonylureas, biguanidines, p-adrenoreceptor agonists, a-glycosidase inhibitors, and insulin. Also, compounds of Formula I may be used in combination with HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins), bile acid binding resin, or fibric acid derivatives to improve the lipid profile of subjects with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Compounds of Formula I may also be used in combination with agents that regulate hypertension (e.g., inhibitors of angiotension converting enzyme (ACE), p-blockers, calcium channel blockers) and body weight of subjects with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.<br>
The following specific examples are presented to illustrate the invention described herein, but should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any way.<br>

To a solution of the racemic indene acid prepared in Example 2a (300 g, 1.29 mol) in 4.5 L CH3CN, was added quinine (324 g, 1.0 mol) at rt. The mixture was stirred for 1 hour, and became a solution. A small amount of insoluble particles was removed by filtration through a microfiber filter under vacuum. The filtrate was then mechanically stirred under Ar over night. After 24 hours, a small sample of solid was taken and analyzed, showing 76.2% ee. The agitation was stopped after two more days. The suspension was filtered. The filter cake was washed with CH3CN (3 x 200 ml), and then dried under vacuum at 40°C for 3 hours. This solid was stirred with 4.5 L CH3CN at 70°C until all solids went into solution. The solution was allowed to cool down to rt slowly. The resulting suspension was stirred at rt for 24 hours. The suspension was filtered. The filter cake was washed with CHsCN (3 x 250 mL), and then dried under vacuum at 40°C for 24 hours. This quinine salt was collected as a white solid (254.6 g, 35.4% yield, 96.8% ee).<br>
The quinine salt (544.3 g, 0.98 mol) was dissolved in 4.0 L CH2CI2 to obtain a clear solution. It was stirred vigorously with 4.0 L of 2N HCI solution in a 22-L round-bottomed flask with a bottom valve. After 30 minutes, the mixture was allowed to settle. The bottom layer was separated and top aqueous layer was extracted with 1 L CH2CI2. The<br>
combined CH2CI2 layers were washed with water (3 x 2.0 L) until pH 5.0-6.0, and then<br>
dried over Na2SO4. The product (230.8 g, 99%, 96.8% ee) was obtained as an off white solid after solvent removal and vacuum drying. 1H NMR was identical to that of the racemic material described in Example 2a.<br>
Treatment of the mother liquor in similar fashion gave the (R) isomer. Alternatively, the mother liquor may be subjected to aqueous basic conditions in order to effect racemization and recovery of racemic starting material.<br>

The solvents were removed at a reduced pressure. The resulting mixture was stirred in 1.5 L of 1N HCI solution and 1.5 L CH2CI2. The aqueous layer was extracted with CH2CI2 (2 x 250 ml). The combined CH2CI2 layers were washed with 1 L of 1N HCI solution and stirred with 1 L of 1N NaOH solution. The organic layer was extracted with 1N NaOH solution (2 x 0.5 L). The combined aqueous layer was washed with CH2CI2 (2 x 250 mL), and acidified (pH 2.0-3.0) by a slow addition of cone. HCI solution at below 15°C. The acidic mixture was extracted with CH2CI2 (2 x 1.5 L), and washed with water (2 x 0.5 L) until pH 5.0-6.0.

A suspension of racemic indene acid (Example 2, 980 mg, 4.2 mmol), C!Rh(PPh3)3 (139 mg, 0.15 mmol), NaHCO3 (378 mg, 4.5 mmol) in EtOH (20 mL), and H2O (10 mL) was shaken in a 500 mL pressure bottle under 60 psi H2 for 30 hours. Additional CIRh(PPh3)3 (300 mg, 0.33 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture and hydrogenation was continued for 3 more days. After this time, EtOH was removed at a reduced pressure and the residue was diluted with 200 mL water. The black solid was removed by filtration and the filtrate was washed with EtOAc (2 x. 200 mL). The aqueous solution was then acidified with cone. HCI, and extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 x 100 mL). The combined CH2CI2 layer was washed with brine and dried over Na2SO4. Removal of the solvent in vacuum afforded the indane acid as light yellow oil (600 mg, 60%). The product mixture resulted a diastereomeric mixture (87:13) in favor of the syn isomers as determined by NMR analysis, using the ratio of integration of NMR peaks 6 7.11(d, 1H) for the anti, and 8 7.03(d, 1H) for the syn isomers.<br>
Resolution of the product into optical isomers may be accomplished as follows: to a mechanically stirred solution of the syn indane acetic acid [(2R, 1R) and (2S,1S), 14.69 g, 62.7 mmol] in acetonitrile (290 mL) at rt, was added (/?H+)-a-methylbenzylamine (8.49 mL, 65.9 mmol) in one portion. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight. Little solid formation was observed. The reaction mixture was concentrated to dryness and the residue was redissolved in acetonitrile (200 mL) with heating. Magnetic stirring was begun to initiate precipitation. The mixture was stirred overnight. The solids were collected by filtration, and washed three times with a small amount of cold acetonitrile. The solids were then dried under vacuum for 1.5 hours (8.1 g, 86% ee). The slightly wet solids were recrystallized in acetonitrile (120 mL) to give 6.03 g of the (2S)-2-[(1 S)-5-methoxy-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-yl]butanoic acid, (R)-a-methylbenzylamine salt (94.4% ee). A second crop was collected from various filtrates (0.89 g, 97.6% ee). The overall yield of resolution was 31% (62% based on the maximum content of (2S,1 S) acid in the racemate). The material was identical to that obtained in Example 4.<br><br>
Optical purity for this Example and that of Example 4 may also be analyzed by chiral HPLC; Column: Chiracel AD, 4.6 (I.D.) x 250 mm; Mobile Phase, A: 0.1% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) in hexanes, B: 0.1% TFA in IPA (isopropyl alcohol); Method, Isocratic 95%A (5%B), 20 min.; Flow Rate, 1.5 mL/min.; Detector (UV), 284 nm. Retention times for the four possible diastereomers are 5.163 min. (2S,1R), 6.255 min. (2R,1S), 10.262 min. (2R,1R) and 14.399 min. (2S.7S). The first locator (2S or 2R) denotes the absolute configuration of the carbon adjacent to the carboxyl group (the 2-positon); the second locator (1Sor 1R) denotes the absolute configuration of the indane ring carbon (its 1-position).<br>
The stereochemical assignment for each peak was determined by chiral HPLC analysis of a non-equal (syn/anti) racemic diastereomeric mixture of compound 5, which provided four baseline-resolved peaks. Peaks 3 and 4, and peaks 1 and 2 represented enantiomer pairs, based on UV integration. The absolute configuration of the compound of peak 4 was determined to be 2S, 1S by X-ray structural analysis. Peak. 3, the corresponding enantiomer, was then assigned a 2R, 1R configuration with certainty. Peak 1 was assigned to the (2S,7R)-diastereomer (retention time: 5.363 min., ca. 0.97% area) by comparison to the minor product obtained from the reduction of the chiral acid (Example 3) as described in Example 4. The remaining peak 2, could then be assigned with certainty to the compound with 2R.1S configuration.<br>

A suspension of the hydroxyindane carboxylate prepared in Example 7 (208 g, 889 mmol), oxazole alcohol prepared in Example 10 (212 g, 977 mmol), ADDP (335 g, 1.33 mol), Ph3P (348 g, 1.33 mol) in 6.0 L anhydrous THF was stirred at rt under Ar. The reaction was followed by 1H NMR. No further progress was observed after 2 days. After solids were removed by filtration, THF was removed under reduced pressure. The remaining mixture was stirred in 3 L of 50/50 mixture EtOAc/hexane for 10 minutes, and more solids were formed and removed by filtration. The filtrate was concentrated and subjected to the same procedure with 25/75 mixture of EtOAc/hexane. After solvents were removed, the resulting oily mixture was purified on a silica gel (3.0 kg) column using CH2CI2 (10.0 L) and 20% CH3CN/ CH2CI2 (10.0 L) as solvent. Fractions containing product were collected, and then concentrated. The crude mixture was dissolved in 4.0 L CHjCIa, and the unreacted hydroxy compound was removed by washing with 1N NaOH (3x1 L). The CH2CI2 layer was dried over Na2SO4. The product (358 g, 93%) was obtained as a light yellow oil after solvent removal and vacuum drying. 1H NMR (DMSO-<br><br>

To a solution of LiOH (90.4 g, 3.76 mol) in 1.3 L water and 1.3 L MeOH, was added a solution of the ester prepared in Example 11 (325 g, 0.75 mol) in 3.9 L THF at rt. The solution turned cloudy. This mixture was heated at 60°C (pot temperature) for 4 hours, and TLC (50% EtOAc/hexane) analysis showed ca. 50% conversion. A solution of LiOH (30.1 g, 1.25 mol) in water (200 mL) was added to the reaction mixture. After 2 hours, TLC analysis showed ca. 85% reaction. Again, a solution of LiOH (30.1 g, 1.25 mol) in water (200 mL) was added to the reaction mixture. After 2 hours, TLC analysis showed very little starting ester left. After the reaction mixture was cooled to rt, THF and MeOH were removed at a reduced pressure. The residue was diluted with water until the solids dissolved (a total of 60 L of water used). Cone. HCI solution was slowly added to this aqueous solution until pH 2.0-3.0. The solid was collected by filtration, and dried under house vacuum overnight. This solid was stirred with 15 L EtOAc and 2 L of 1N HCI solution for 30-minutes. The EtOAc layer was separated and washed with 1N HCI solution (2x1 L). The organic phase was then washed with water (4 x 2 L) until pH = 5.0-6.0. Under Ar protection, the EtOAc solution was reduced to 2.5 L by normal pressure distillation, then cooled to rt without disturbance. White solid precipitated out. After further cooling in an ice water bath for 2 hours, the solid was filtrated and washed with 500 mL cold EtOAc. After drying under high vacuum at 35°C to a constant weight, the final product (266 g, 81%, 98% ee, ) was collected as a white crystal. 1H NMR (CDCI3) 5 7.82(d, 2H), 7.20(d, 2H). 7.05(d, 1H), 6.75(d, 1H), 6.70(dd, 1H), 4.20(t, 2H), 3.42(q, 1H), 2.95(t, 2H), 2.80(m, 2H), 2.50(m, 1H), 2.35(s, 3H), 2.32(s, 3H), 2.20(m, 1.90(m, 1H), 1.65(m, 1H), 1.45(m, 1H), 0.90(t, 3H).

Step 1. To a solution of 5-methoxy-indanone (10 g) dissolved in toluene (150 mL) was added AICI3 (15 g). The mixture was refluxed for 4 hours until a precipitate appeared. The resulting mixture was cooled and poured into ice water (150 mL). The precipitate was filtered and washed with water, then air-dried to give the desired product (8.5 g, 90%).<br>
Step 2. Benzyl bromide (17 g), 5-hydroxyl-indanone (15 g), K2C03 (20 g), and 200 mL acetone were mixed in a round-bottom flask (500 mL). The mixture was refluxed<br>
for 1 hour. The K2CO3 was filtered off, and the filtrate was evaporated. The resulting residue was crystallized from EtOAc to give 18 g product (75%).<br>
Step 3. A solution of 5-benzyloxyl-indanone (1.14 g, 4.79 mmol) and diethyl malonate (0.844 g, 5.29 mmol) in THF (20 mL) was cooled to 0°C under argon, and TiCI4 (10 ml, 1M in CH2CI2) was added dropwise. Pyridine (2 ml) was added finally. The resulting mixture was stirred overnight at rt. After filtration, EtOAc (30 ml) was added into the filtrate. The organic layer was washed with brine (20 mL x 3), dried with Na2SO4, and evaporated. The residue was separated by silica gel chromatography to give 800 mg product (50%).<br>
Step 4. The product of step 3 (1.7 g) was dissolved in MeOH (25 mL), and Pd-C (300 mg) was added as a slurry in MeOH, and placed under 60 psi H2in a Parr shaker for 6 hours. After filtration and concentration, 1.2 g product was obtained (92%).<br>
Step 5. P(Ph)3 (420 mg) and ADDP (420 mg) were dissolved in THF (5 mL) at 0°C, and stirred for 10 minutes. A THF solution of oxazole (300 mg) and phenol (430 mg) was added to the flask. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 hours, and filtered. The filtrate was evaporated and the resulting residue was separated by silica gel chromatography to give product (320 mg, 45%).<br>
Step 6. The intermediate prepared in step 5 (160 mg) was dissolved in THF (5 mL), and iodoethane (0.5 mL) and f-BuOK (50 mg) were added to the solution and stirred overnight. After filtration, the product was separated by using TLC, providing 100 mg (65%).<br>
Step 7. The intermediate prepared in step 6 (30 mg) was dissolved in DMSO (1 mL). LiCI (160 mg) was added into the flask. The mixture was refluxed for 5 hours. From the resulting mixture, the product was separated by TLC, giving 13 mg (52%).<br>
Step 8. The intermediate prepared in step 7 was subjected to hydrolysis in aqueous KOH as described for Example 2 to obtain the product: LC-MS, RT 3.57 min., M+1 406; 1H NMR (CD2CI2): 6 0.93 (t, 3H), 1.40-1.70 (m, 2H), 1.80-2.20 (m, 2H), 2.30 (s, 3H), 2.40 (m, 1H), 2.60-2.80 (m, 2H), 2.90 (t, 2H), 3.20-3.40 (m, 1H), 4.10 (t, 2H), 6.60 (dd, 1H), 6.70 (d, 1H), 7.00 (d, 1H), 7.30 (m, 3H), 7.90 (m, 2H).<br>

Step 2. In the first flask, N-benzoylalanine (2 g, 10.35 mmol) was dissolved in THF (20 mL), and carbonyl diimidazole (CDI) (1.84 g, 11.39 mmol) was added. The resulting mixture was stirred 1 hour at rt and cooled down to -78°C. Into a second flask, ethyl acetate (3.83 g, 43.48 mmol) in THF (40 ml) was cooled down to -78°C and LDA (24.3 mL, 48.51 mmol, 2 M in THF) pre-cooled to -78°C was added. The resulting solution was stirred 30 minutes at -78°C, and the lithium enolate generated was cannulated into the first flask. The resulting white slurry was stirred 30 minutes at -78°C and warmed up to -10°C. The reaction was quenched with a saturated aqueous solution of NH4CI. Phases were separated and the organics were dried over MgSO4 and solvents removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was carried to the next step without purification. This gave ethyl 4-(benzoylamino)-3-oxopentanoate (2.6 g, 95.5% yield) as a white solid.

The organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was then purified by silica gel flash chromatography (9:1 hexanes/EtOAc) to afford the product as a pinkish oil that solidified upon standing (1.14 g, 62%). 1H NMR (CDCI3): S 2.38 (s, 3H), 3.45 (s, 3H), 3.74 (s, 3H), 3.80 (s, 2H), 7.49 (AB quartet, 4H); R, (0.4, eluant9:1 hexanes/EtOAc).<br>

To a solution of the thiazole of Example 176 (1.14 g, 4.37 mmol) in THF (60 ml) at 0°C, was added portion-wise LiAIH^ (663 mg, 17.5 mmol). After 30 minutes, the reaction mixture was warmed to rt and stirred for an additional 60 minutes. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0°C, and the excess LiAIH4 was quenched by dropwise addition of water (5 mL), 1N NaOH (10 mL), and water (5 mL) sequentially. The mixture was then diluted with a saturated solution of Rochelle salt and extracted with EtOAc (4 x 75 mL). The combined organic phases were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by silica gel flash chromatography (3:2 hexanes/EtOAc) to afford the product as a white solid (830 mg, 82%).

EVALUATION OF COMPOUNDS<br>
Demonstration of the activity of the compounds of the present invention may be accomplished through in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo assays that are well known in the art. For example, to demonstrate the efficacy of a pharmaceutical agent for the treatment of diabetes and related disorders such as Syndrome X, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and hyperinsulinemia or atherosclerotic disease and related disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesteremia, the following assays may be used.<br>
Insulin Receptor Binding in 3T3-L1 Cells Treated with Compounds<br>
3T3-L1 cells were seeded at 9300 cells per well in Costar flat bottom TC and incubated for 1 week until they were 2 days post-confluent (e.g., cells have reached maximum density). The cells were then treated for 2 days with differentiation media (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM),100 ug/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 10% Fetal Bovine Serum) containing 0.5 uM human Insulin-like Growth Factor (IGF-1) and test compounds. After treatment, the media was replaced with differentiation media, and the cells were incubated for 4 days. The cells were then assayed for insulin receptor activity. After washing the cells with buffer, they were incubated with 0.1 nM 12ol-insulin and (+/-) 100 nM unlabeled insulin, and incubated at rt for 1 hour. The cells were<br>
then washed Sxwith buffer, dissolved with 1N NaOH, and counted on a gamma counter. An EC50 value was determined if a plateau was attained and percent maximum stimulation was assessed.<br>
In Vivo Assays<br>
Method for Measuring Blood Glucose Levels<br>
db/db mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were bled (by either eye or tail vein) and grouped according to equivalent mean blood glucose levels. They were dosed orally (by gavage in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle) with the test compound once daily for 14 days. At this point, the animals were bled again by eye or tail vein and blood glucose levels were determined. In each case, glucose levels were measured with a Glucometer Elite XL (Bayer Corporation, Elkhart, IN).<br>
Method for Measuring Triglyceride Levels<br>
hApoAl mice (obtained from Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were bled (by either eye or tail vein) and grouped according to equivalent mean serum triglyceride levels. They were dosed orally (by gavage in a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle) with the test compound once daily for 8 days. The animals were then bled again by eye or tail vein, and serum triglyceride levels were determined. In each case, triglyceride levels were measured using a Technicon Axon Autoanalyzer (Bayer Corporation, Tarrytown, NY).<br>
Method for Measuring HDL-Cholesterol Levels<br>
To determine plasma HDL-cholesterol levels, hApoAl mice are bled and grouped with equivalent mean plasma HDL-cholesterol levels. The mice are orally dosed once daily with vehicle or test compound for 7 days, and then bled again on day 8. Plasma is analyzed for HDL-cholesterol using the Synchron Clinical System (CX4) (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA).<br>
Method for Measuring Total Cholesterol, HDL-Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and Glucose Levels<br>
In another in vivo assay, obese monkeys are bled, then orally^dosed once daily with vehicle or test compound for 4 weeks, and then bled again. Serum is analyzed for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose using the Synchron Clinical System (CX4) (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Lipoprotein subclass analysis is<br><br>
performed by NMR spectroscopy as described by Oliver et al., (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:5306-5311, 2001).<br>
Method for Measuring an Effect on Cardiovascular Parameters<br>
Cardiovascular parameters (e.g., heart rate and blood pressure) are also evaluated. SHR rats are orally dosed once daily with vehicle or test compound for 2 weeks. Blood pressure and heart rate are determined using a tail-cuff method-as described by Grinsell et al., (Am. J. Hypertens. 13:370-375, 2000).  In monkeys, blood pressure and heart rate are monitored as described by Shen et al., (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Therap. 278:1435-1443, 1996).<br>
Compounds of the present invention were tested in the above assays and by the resulting activity profiles, they were found to have an effect on blood glucose levels and serum triglyceride levels, and therefore, a potential utility in the treatment of diabetes and related disorders such as Syndrome X, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, and hyperinsulinemia or cardiovascular disease and related disorders such as hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesteremia.<br>
Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Based on the above tests, or other well known assays used to determine the efficacy for treatment of conditions identified above in mammals, and by comparison of these results with the results of known medicaments that are used to treat these conditions, the effective dosage of the compounds of this invention can readily be determined for treatment of each desired indication. The amount of the active ingredient to be administered in the treatment of one of these conditions can vary widely according to such considerations as the particular compound and dosage unit employed, the mode of administration, the period of treatment, the age and sex of the patient treated, and the nature and extent of the condition treated.<br>
The total amount of the active ingredient to be administered may generally range from about 0.001 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg, and preferably from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg body weight per day. A unit dosage may contain from about 0.05 mg to about 1500 mg of active ingredient, and may be administered one or more times per day. The daily dosage for administration by injection, including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, and parenteral injections, and use of infusion techniques may be from about 0.01 to about 200 mg/kg. The daily rectal dosage regimen may be from 0.01 to<br><br>
200 mg/kg of total body weight. The transdermal concentration may be that required to maintain a daily dose of from 0.01 to 200 mg/kg.<br>
Of course, the specific initial and continuing dosage regimen for each patient will vary according to the nature and severity of the condition as determined by the attending diagnostician, the activity of the specific compound employed, the age of the patient, the diet of the patient, time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion of the drug, drug combinations, and the like. The desired mode of treatment and number of doses of a compound of the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof may be ascertained by those skilled in the art using conventional treatment tests.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be utilized to achieve the desired pharmacological effect by administration to a patient in need thereof in an appropriately formulated pharmaceutical composition. A patient, for the purpose of this invention, is a mammal, including a human, in need of treatment for a particular condition or disease. Therefore, the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions which are comprised of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and a pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound identified by the methods described herein, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or ester thereof. A pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is any carrier which is relatively non-toxic and innocuous to a patient at concentrations consistent with effective activity of the active ingredient so that any side effects ascribable to the carrier do not vitiate the beneficial effects of the active ingredient.   A pharmaceutically effective amount of a compound is that amount which produces a result or exerts an influence on the particular condition being treated. The compounds identified by the methods described herein may be administered with a pharrnaceutically-acceptable carrier using any effective conventional dosage unit forms, including, for example, immediate and timed release preparations, orally, parenterally, topically, or the like.<br>
For oral administration, the compounds may be formulated into solid or liquid preparations such as, for example, capsules, pills, tablets, troches, lozenges, melts, powders, solutions, suspensions, or emulsions, and may be prepared according to methods known to the art for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions. The solid unit dosage forms may be a capsule which can be of the ordinary hard- or soft-shelled gelatin type containing, for example, surfactants, lubricants, and inert fillers such as lactose, sucrose, calcium phosphate, and corn starch.<br>
In another embodiment, the compounds of this invention may be tableted with conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose, and cornstarch in combination with binders such as acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin; disintegrating agents intended to assist the <br>
break-up and dissolution of the tablet following administration such as potato starch,<br><br>
alginic acid, corn starch, and guar gum; lubricants intended to improve the flow of tablet granulation and to prevent the adhesion of tablet material to the surfaces of the tablet dies and punches, for example, talc, stearic acid, or magnesium, calcium or zinc stearate; dyes; coloring agents; and flavoring agents intended to enhance the aesthetic qualities of the tablets and make them more acceptable to the patient. Suitable excipients for use in oral liquid dosage forms include diluents such as water and alcohols, for example, ethanol, benzyl alcohol, and polyethylene alcohols, either with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant, suspending agent, or emulsifying agent. Various other materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance tablets, pills or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar or both.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules are suitable for the preparation of an aqueous suspension. They provide the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting agent, a suspending agent, and one or more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example, those sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents described above, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil such as liquid paraffin or a mixture of vegetable oils. Suitable emulsifying agents may be (1) naturally occurring gums such as gum acacia and gum tragacanth, (2) naturally occurring phosphatides such as soy bean and lecithin, (3) esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example, sorbitan monooleate, and (4) condensation products of said partial esters with ethylene oxide, for example, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavoring agents.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil such as, for example, arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil, or coconut oil; or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent such as, for example, beeswax, hard paraffin, orcetyl alcohol. The suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives, for example, ethyl or n-propyl p-hydroxybenzoate; one or more coloring agents; one or more flavoring agents; and one or more sweetening agents such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents such as, for example, glycerol, propylene glycoi, sorbitol, or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, and preservative, flavoring and coloring agents.<br>
The compounds of this invention may also be administered parenterally, that is,<br><br>
subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly, or interperitoneally, as injectable dosages of the compound in a physiologically acceptable diluent with a pharmaceutical carrier which may be a sterile liquid or mixture of liquids such as water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions; an alcohol such as ethanol, isopropanol, or hexadecyl alcohol; glycols such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol; glycerol ketals such as 2,2-dimethyf-1,1-dioxolane-4-methanol, ethers such as poly(ethyleneglycol) 400; an oil; a fatty acid; a fatty acid ester or glyceride; or an acetylated fatty acid glyceride with or without the addition of a pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant such as a soap or a detergent, suspending agent such as pectin, carbomers, methycellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, or carboxymethylcellulose, or emulsifying agent and other pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Illustrative of oils which can be used in the parenteral formulations of this invention are those of petroleum, animal, vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil, olive oil, petrolatum, and mineral oil. Suitable fatty acids include oleic acid, stearic acid, and isostearic acid. Suitable fatty acid esters are, for example, ethyl oleate and isopropyl myristate. Suitable soaps include fatty alkali metal, ammonium, and triethanolamine salts and suitable detergents include cationic detergents, for example, dimethyl dialkyl ammonium halides, alkyl pyridinium halides, and alkylamine acetates; anionic detergents, for example, alkyl, aryl, and olefin sulfonates, alkyl, olefin, ether, and monoglyceride sulfates, and sulfosuccinates; nonionic detergents, for example, fatty amine oxides, fatty acid alkanolamides, and polyoxyethylenepolypropylene copolymers; and amphoteric detergents, for example, alkyl-beta-aminopropionates, and 2-alkylimidazoline quarternary ammonium salts, as well as mixtures.<br>
The parenteral compositions of this invention may typically contain from about 0.5% to about 25% by weight of the active ingredient in solution. Preservatives and buffers may also be used advantageously.  In order to minimize or eliminate irritation at the site of injection, such compositions may contain a non-ionic surfactant having a hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) of from about 12 to about 17. The quantity of surfactant in such formulation ranges from about 5% to about 15% by weight. The surfactant can be a single component having the above HLB or can be a mixture of two or more components having the desired HLB.<br>
Illustrative of surfactants used in parenteral formulations are the class of polyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, for example, sorbitan monooleate and the high molecular weight adducts of ethylene oxide with a hydrophobic base, formed by the<br>
condensation of propylene oxide with propylene glycol.<br><br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of sterile injectable aqueous suspensions. Such suspensions may be formulated according to known methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents such as, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agents which may be a naturally occurring phosphatide such as lecithin, a condensation product of an alkylene oxide with a fatty acid, for example, polyoxyethylene stearate, a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a long chain aliphatic alcohol, for example, heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, a condensation product of ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived form a fatty acid and a hexitol such as polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or a condensation product of an ethylene oxide with a partial ester derived from a fatty acid and a hexitol anhydride, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate. <br>
The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent. Diluents and solvents that may be employed are, for example, water, Ringer's solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile fixed oils are conventionally employed as solvents or suspending media. For this purpose, any bland, fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid may be used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
A composition of the invention may also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administration of the drug. These compositions may be prepared by mixing the drug with a suitable non-irritation excipient which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the rectal temperature and will therefore melt in the rectum to release the drug. Such material are, for example, cocoa butter and polyethylene glycol.<br>
Another formulation employed in the methods of the present invention employs transdermal delivery devices ("patches"). Such transdermal patches may be used to provide continuous or discontinuous infusion of the compounds of the present invention in controlled amounts. The construction and use of transdermal patches for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,023,252, incorporated herein by reference). Such patches may be constructed for continuous, pulsatile, or on demand delivery of pharmaceutical agents.<br>
It may be desirable or necessary to introduce the pharmaceutical composition to the patient via a mechanical delivery device. The construction and use of mechanical delivery devices for the delivery of pharmaceutical agents is well known in the art.  For example, direct techniques for administering a drug directly to the brain usually involve<br>
placement of a drug delivery catheter into the patient's ventricular system to bypass the<br><br>
blood-brain barrier. One such implantable delivery system, used for the transport of agents to specific anatomical regions of the body, is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,011,472, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The compositions of the invention may also contain other conventional pharmaceuticaily acceptable compounding ingredients, generally referred to as carriers or diluents, as necessary or desired. Any of the compositions of this invention may be preserved by the addition of an antioxidant such as ascorbic acid or by other suitable preservatives. Conventional procedures for preparing such compositions in appropriate dosage forms can be utilized.<br>
