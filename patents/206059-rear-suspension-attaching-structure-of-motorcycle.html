An explanation will be given of operation of the above-described rear suspension 30 as follows.<br>
Fig. 5 is a first operation view for explaining operation of the rear suspension adopting the rear suspension attaching structure according to the invention (first embodiment).<br>
In Fig. 1, for example, when the motorcycle 10 rides over a projected portion on a load face and the rear wheel 33 is moved upwardly relative to the vehicle body side (main frame 11 and power unit 16), in Fig. 5, the swing arm 32 is swung upwardly from a position shown by imaginary lines to a position shown by bold lines centering on the pivotal shaft 31 as in an arrow mark (D, in accordance therewith, the first link 51 is swung centering on the first shaft 56 in the clockwise direction as shown by an arrow mark ©, thereby, the lower end attaching portion 43 attached to the third shaft 58 is lifted<br><br>
as shown by an arrow mark (3).<br>
Therefore, the rear cushion unit 34 produces attenuating force while being contracted to thereby absorb impact.<br><br>
Fig . 6 is a second operation view for explaining operation of the rear suspension adopting the rear suspension attaching structure according to the invention (first embodiment) and is a view for explaining a relationship between an amount of moving the rear wheel shaft 25 of the swing arm 32 in the up and down direction and a stroke amount of the rear cushion unit 34. Further, in the drawing, a large © mark designates the rear wheel shaft 2 5 and a small © mark designates the upper attaching bolt 47 and the third shaft 58.<br>
When the rear wheel shaft 25 is disposed at a position designated by the © mark, that is, a position in a state in which a rider rides on the motorcycle, the vehicle is stopped (without operating force in accelerating or decelerating the vehicle to the vehicle) and the vehicle is erected (also referred to as '1G state position of riding'. Hereinafter, the position is described as 'neutral position of riding'. This is also neutral positions of riding of the swing arm 32 and rear wheel 33 (refer to Fig. 1) ) , the third shaft 58 constituting a connecting shaft of the link mechanism 37 (refer to Fig. 2) and the rear cushion unit 34 (refer to Fig. 2), is disposed at a position designated by the © mark.<br>
,[0025] .<br>
When a total length of the cushion unit 34 in this case, (here, a distance between an axis center 47a of the upper<br><br><br>
attaching bolt 47 and an axis center 58a of the third shaft 58, the same as follows) is designated by notation La and a total length of the rear cushion unit 34 extended maximally is designated by notation Le, a stroke amount of the rear cushion unit 34 at the neutral position of riding is designated by notation Sa. (That is, Sa = Le - La)<br>
.[f)n?fi]<br>
First, when the swing arm 32 is swung from the neutral position of riding to an extended side of the cushion unit 34 (swung downwardly) (refer to Fig. 2), the swing arm 32, the upper brackets 36 of the swing arm 32, the lower end attaching portion 43 of the rear cushion unit 34, the third shaft 58 and the rear wheel shaft 25 are disposed at positions designated by bold lines and a moving amount of the rear wheel shaft 25 in this case to the extended side of the rear cushion unit 34 (moving amount of an axis center 25a) is designated by notation Da. At this occasion, a total length of the rear cushion unit 34 is designated by notation Lb and the stroke amount is designated by notation Sb. (That is, Sb = Le - Lb)<br>
TCTtrZTT"<br>
Further, when the swing arm 32 is swung from the neutral position of riding to a contracted side of the rear cushion unit 34 (swung upwardly) , the swing arm 32, the upper brackets 36 of the swing arm 32 the lower end attaching portion 43 of the rear cushion unit 34, the third shaft 58 and the rear wheel shaft 25, are disposed at positions designated by one-dotted chain lines and a moving amount of the rear wheel shaft 25 to the contracted side of the cushion unit 43, is designated by<br><br>
notation Da the same as that of the above-described moving amount.  In this case, the total length of the rear cushion unit 34 is designated by notation Lc and the stroke amount is designated by notation Sc. (That is, Sc = Le - Lc)<br>
According to the rear suspension 3 0 of the invention (refer to Fig. 2), by using the link mechanism 37 (refer to Fig. 2), there is established (Sc-Sa) )  (Sa-Sb).<br>
That is, by making a stroke to the contracted side of the rear cushion unit 34 by the rear wheel shaft 25, a change in the stroke amount of the rear cushion unit 34 is increased.<br>
Thereby, the more contracted the rear cushion unit 34, the more increased is the moving speed of the piston of the rear cushion unit 34 and the more increased is the attenuating force produced as the rear cushion unit 34.<br>
[43029] .<br>
An explanation will be given as follows of operation of the above-described rear suspension attaching structure.<br>
Figs. 7(a) and 7(b) are operation views for explaining operation of the rear suspension attaching structure, Fig. 7 (a) shows the embodiment and Fig. 7 (b) shows a comparative example.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 7(a), an interval between a portion of the cylinder attaching member 46 attached to the swing arm and a portion of the lower attaching portion 43<br>
attached to the link mechanism, is designated by notation L2.<br>
\ <br>
In the comparative example of Fig. 7(b), an interval<br>
between a portion of the first attaching portion 116 of the<br><br>
cushion unit 106 attached to the vehicle frame and a portion of the second attaching portion 117 of the cushion unit 106 attached to the first link member, is designated by notation LI.<br>
In Figs. 7(a) and 7(b), according to the invention, the cylinder attaching member is attached to the side face 41a of the cylinder portion 41, according to the comparative example, the first attaching portion 116 is attached to the end portion of the cylinder portion 115 and therefore, the interval L2 according to the embodiment can be made shorter than the interval LI according to the comparative example by a distance DL.<br>
[O032] '<br>
Further, although according to the above-described embodiment, in Fig. 1 through Fig. 3, the side face 41a of the cylinder portion 41 of the rear cushion unit 34 is attached to the swing arm 32 and the lower end attaching portion 43 of the rear cushion unit 34 is attached to the vehicle body side, (that is, the power unit 16) via the link mechanism 37, the side face 41a of the cylinder portion 41 may be attached to the vehicle body side, for example, the power unit 16 via the link mechanism 37 and the lower end attaching portion 43 may be attached to the swing arm 32.<br>
