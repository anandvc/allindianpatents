The present invention relates to a novel and Non-invasive Pharmaceutical composition useful for the treatment in male sexual impotence. The present invention particularly relates to a pharmaceutical composition containing the drug Alprostadil (otherwise IcnoAvn as prostaglandin Ei). The present invention also relates to a process for the preixn ation of the above said pharmaceutical composition<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
The term "impotence" has been used in this specification to signify the inability of the male to attain and maintain erection of the penis sufficient to permit satistactory sexual intercourse. The term "erectile dysfunction" has been suggested as a more precise term "to signify an inability of the male to achieve an erect penis as part of the overall muhifaceted process of male sexual function." Droller, MJ. et. al. Impotence. Consensus Development Conference Statement, National Institutes of Health (1993).<br>
Erectile dysfunction may result from psychological causes (psychogenic erectile dysfunction) or organic causes or a combination of both. Organic causes include physiological, nervous, vascular and hormonal pathologies or a combination thereof.<br>
The normal physiology of an erection involves nerve impulses, which signal certain muscles to relax. These muscles, when contracted, restrict blood flow through arteries in the penis. When relaxed, the muscles permit a significant increase in blood lltiw. The increased blood flow engorges three groups of erectile tissue within the penis with blood and the penis becomes less flaccid. The engorged erectile tissue and the muscle stiiicture of the penis depress adjacent veins, restricting the flow of blood out oi^ the i^enis. The restriction of blood flow out of the penis increases and sustains the erection<br>
Deficiencies of some hormones, such as testosterone, or elevation of otheis, such as prolactin, can cause erectile dysfunction. Many drugs, such as diuretics, anti hypertensives, anticonvulsants, narcotics, alcohol, and psychotropic drugs may cause erectile dystUnction as a side effect. Murray, F, T. et al. Amer. J. Medical Sci. 309: 99 - 109 (1995)<br>
Alprostadil (otherwise known as prostaglandin Ei) is a derivative of prostanoic acid, a 20-carbon atom lipid acid of the formula.<br><br>
q<br>
This drug is commercially available, e.g., from Chinoin Pharmaceutical and ( hemical Works Ltd. (Budapest, Hungary) under the designation 'Alprostadil IJSP\ from Pharmacia and Upjohn under the designation "Caverject" and from The Upjohn Company (Kalamazoo, Mich.) under the designation "Prostin VR".<br>
Damage to nerves and blood vessels may also provide an organic cause lor erectile dysfunction. Disease processes may involve several aspects. For example, diabetes, which causes damage to both nerves and blood vessels, can cause erectile dysllinction. A significant percent of all diabetic men will suffer from erectile dysfunction<br>
Methods proposed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction have included external devices, sex therapy, surgical implantation of internal prostheses, injection of drugs directly into the penis and topically applied medications.<br>
External devices include tourniquets (see U.S. Pat. No.2, 818,855) and externally applied vacuum erection aids. While some clinicians consider externally applied ereciion aids as a first option for treatment, some patients are unwilling to use such devices 0 Keefe, M., et al. Medical Clinics of North America 79: 415 - 434 (1995).<br>
External devices such as tourniquets and externally applied vacuum erection aids used for improving the erection have not been successflil due to the unwillingness ol' the patients to use such devices. Other devices such as surgically implanted mechanieai devices, such as hinged or solid rods and inflatable, spring driven or hydraulic prostheses used for similar purpose are not favored due to the penile pain and the localized damage to the penile tissue that may result with the application.<br><br>
A number of injectable products for the treatment of erectile dysfunction are available commercially for injecting into the penile tissue. For example US Pat. No 4J 27,1 18 to La Torre discloses an injectable vasodilator, Patent No. CA 2344435 describes an injectable mixture of the drugs Phentolamine mesylate. Papaverine hydrochloride and Alprosiadil in a suitable buffer and patent no. EP 0459377A2 refers to an injection of Alprostadil<br>
As per Martindale (The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 33*^^ Edition) a major disadvantage of this method is the need for repeated self- injection of the penis and studies siiygesi that the long-term use may result in fibrosis and that priapism may also be a problem<br>
In one commercially available form (MUSEÂ®, Vivus, Menlo Park Calit), /\l|)iostadil is administered in a pellet deposited in the urethra using an applicator with a hollow stem 3.2 cm in length and 3.5mm in diameter. Martindale (The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 33"' lidition) reports that the common side effects include penile pain and urethral pain ov burning with this usage.<br>
Patent N0.US6, 323,241 Bl provides methods and compositions for the treatment of erectile dysfunction by the intranavicular application of pharmaceutical eonipositions to the mammalian penis. The composition comprises a vasodilator, preferably pii^siaglandin El, a penetration enhancer, a polysaccharide gum, a lipophilic compound, and an acidic buffer system. While the patent claims a number of advantages over plaeing such composition intranavicularly into the penis, the system may be expensive lo produce besides having problems of disposal due to the applicator used is non-biodegradable<br>
Working alone most drugs, prostaglandin formulations included, do not snniciently permeate the skin to provide drug concentration levels comparable to those obtained from other drug delivery routes. To overcome this problem, topical drugs formulations typically include skin permeability facilitators.<br>
Keeping in view of the limitations of the hitherto known methods and deviees we observed that if a simple and viable application which facilitates easy administration is ])rovided it can lead to increased tolerance and compliance by delivering the active medieament at an appropriate place with ease. Moreover such a process / device will also have a large-scale<br><br>
production capacity. It will have the tlexibility ot ease ot portability lead nig u) better compliance. The product if made extremely environmental friendly by making il totally biodegradable it will have additional advantages, which may not be the case with the earlier applications described in the literature. Comparatively the product / method may be less expensive than the present day used method / product. Till date, there is no such process / product which is commercially available in soft gelatin capsules.<br>
As a much simpler and more acceptable alternative, we have aimed to develop a soft gelatin capsule containing a pharmaceutically active topical composition oi" the drug prostaglandin El (more commonly known as Alprostadil) complexed with permeability facilitators in an emulsified and suitably buffered base with appropriate stabilizers and preservatives and which may contain optionally colouring agents and flavoring agents.<br>
Accordingly the main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and NonÂ¬invasive pharmaceutical composition in the form of a soft gelatin capsule containing prostaglandin El (Alprostadil) which is useful in the treatment oi* male erectile dysfunction.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and Non-invasive pharmaceutical composition in the form of soft gelatin capsules containing prostaglandin El (Alprostadil) which is useful in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction and which facilitates easy administration of the drug at an appropriate place with ease<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and Non-invasive pharmaceutical composition in the form of a soft gelatin capsule containing prostaglandin El (Alprostadil) which is useful in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction, llexibility in ease of portability leading to better compliance.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and NcM&gt;invasive pharmaceutical composition containing a prostaglandin El (Alprosiadil) which is complexed with cyclodextrins such as a, P , y - cyclodextrins or derivatives there of which enhances the drug's solubility and hence improves the drug availability<br><br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and Non-invasive pharmaceutical composition in the form of a soft gelatin capsule containing prostaglandin El (Alprostadil) which is useful in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction and which is extremely environmental friendly and biodegradable.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and Non-nivasive pharmaceutical composition which is in the form of a soft gelatin capsule containing prostaglandin El (Alprostadil) and which contains hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose phthalate as a film forming material which provides adequate stiffness for the soCt gelatin capsule for easy entry into the urethra as well as prevents breakage of the capsule while being used.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a novel and Non-invasive pharmaceutical composition containing prostaglandin El (Alprostadil) which also contains Caprylocaproyl macrogol - 8 glycerides (commercially available as labrosol) or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (commercially known as Transcutol P) or their mixtui es to improve the permeation of the drug, prostaglandin El.<br>
By the term "Non-invasive" it meant to refer to administration of drug, without milicting damage to tissue, such as injection.<br>
Description of the invention:<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel and Non-invasive phai'niaceutical composition in the form of soft gelatin capsules useful in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction which comprises a complex of Alprostadil and cyclodextrins mixed with Caprylocaproyl macrogol - 8 glycerides or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether or their mixtures dispersed in a suitable pharmaceutical vehicle such as a base, presei vatives, antioxidants, emulsifiers. Permeability facilitators, complexing agents, bulteis and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate as a film forming material encapsulated in a soft gelatin capsule.<br>
Optionally the complex of Alprostadil may also contain colouring agents and navouring agents.<br><br>
The soft gelatin capsule of the present invention is to be applied by the iiiuanavicular application to the penis. The capsule contains an elongate tip. The capsule is filled with the composition of the present invention . The application of the capsule is as tbllows : The Capsule containing the composition is squeezed out on the opening of the penis, i.e. in Fossa navicularis region. The composition from the capsule is squeezed out through the elongated tip of the capsule and the composition goes into the penis particiilail\' into the fossa navicular region.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention there is also provided a piocess for the preparation of the novel and Non-invasive pharmaceutical composition in ihc ibrm of soft gelatin capsules useful in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction whicli comprises preparing gelatin soft gel composition by dissolving gelatin and hydroxy propyl methlcellulose phthalate in ammonia solution , adding to this resulting composition a solution containing plasticizers , opacifiers , preservaties with continuous stirring loading the resulting mass into a capsule forming hopper from which the desired uniform weight of the mass for the formulation of the shell and from the medicament hopper [\o\\\ which the desired uniform weight of the composition comprising of the inclusion of a com[)lex of Prostaglandin El (Alprostail) with Cyclodextrin admixed with other solid ingredients dispersed in oily materials, the inclusion having pH in the range of 3 0 to 7 4 being delivered to obtain a homogeneous soft gelatin capsule incorporating the active ingredient and if desired , trimming and poUshing the resulting soft gelatin capsule.<br>
