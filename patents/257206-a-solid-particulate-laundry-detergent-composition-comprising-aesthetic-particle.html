				<td>A SOLID PARTICULATE LAUNDRY DETERGENT COMPOSITION<br>
COMPRISING AESTHETIC PARTICLE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a solid particulate laundry detergent composition comprising aesthetic particle. The aesthetic particle is visually distinct from the remainder of the composition and does not readily segregate during handling, transport and storage.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Consumers like, and tend to buy, laundry detergent powders that comprise colored speckles. For this reason, laundry detergent manufactures incorporate aesthetic particles that are visually distinct from the remainder of the detergent powder into their particulate laundry detergent compositions. The larger the aesthetic particle, in comparison to the remainder of the detergent powder, the greater the consumer preference; for this reason, laundry detergent manufacturers seek to incorporate the largest colored speckles possible into their detergent powder products. However, problems such as poor flowability and segregation occur when the incorporated speckles become too large.<br>
EP6048142 relates to the production of layered and rounded agglomerates having allegedly a good flowability profile.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a solid particulate laundry detergent composition as defined in Claim 1. The Inventors have found that large aesthetic particles can be incorporated into a solid particulate laundry detergent composition that still retains a good flowability profile and avoids the problem of segregation by carefully controlling the physical properties of the aesthetic particle in relation to the remainder of the solid particulate laundry detergent composition.<br><br>

Relative jamming onset<br><br>
 The relative jamming onset is measured using a Flodex™ instrument supplied by Hanson Research Corporation, Chatsworth, California. USA. As used in this test method the term "Hopper" refers to the Cylinder Assembly of the Flodex™ instrument; the term "orifice" refers to the hole in the center of the Flow Disk that is used in a flow test; the symbol "B" refers to the diameter of the orifice in the Flow Disk used in the test; and the symbol "b" refers to the dimensionless orifice size, as defined by the ratio of the orifice diameter to the 30th percentile particle size (D30) specified in Applicant's Test Method titled "Flowable Particle Mass Based Cumulative Particle Size Distiibution Test", b = B /<br>
D30.<br>
The Flodex™ instrument is operated in accordance with the instructions contained in the Flodex™ operation manual version 21-101-000 rev. C 2004-03 with the following exceptions:<br>
(a)	The suitable container that is used to collect the material that is tested is tared on a balance with 0.01 gram precision before the start of the test, and used subsequently to measure the mass of particulate discharge from the Hopper in step (c), below.<br>
(b)	Sample preparation. A bulk sample of particles is suitably riffled to provide a sub-sample of 150 ml loose-fill volume. The appropriate sample mass can be determined by measuring the loose fill density specified in the test method titled "bulk density test" described below, and then multiplying by the target volume (150 ml). The mass of the sample (sample mass) is recorded before the start of each test measurement. As the test is non destructive, the same sample may be used repeatedly. The entire sample must be discharged, e.g., by inverting the hopper, and then re-loaded before each measurement.<br>
(c)	Starting with the smallest orifice size (typically 4 mm unless a smaller orifice<br>
is necessary), three repeat measurements are taken for each orifice size. For each<br>
measurement, the sample is loaded into the Hopper and allowed to rest for a rest interval<br>
of about 30 seconds before the orifice is opened according to the procedure described in<br>
the Flodex™ Operation Manual. The sample is  allowed to discharge into the tared<br>
container for a period of at least 60 seconds. After this 60 second period and once the<br>
flow stops and remains stopped for 30 seconds (i.e., no more than 0.1 mass % of the<br>
material is discharged over the 30 second stop interval), then the mass of discharged<br>
material is measured, the orifice is closed and the Hopper is fully emptied by inverting the<br><br>
 Hopper assembly or removing the flow disk. Note: if the flow stops and then re-starts during the 30 second stop interval, then the stop interval clock must be re-started at zero at the next flow stoppage. For each measurement, the mass% discharged is calculated according to the formula: (mass% discharged) = 100 * (mass discharged) / {sample mass). The average of the three mass% discharged measurements is plotted as a function of the dimensionless orifice size (b = B/D30), with the mass% discharged on the ordinate and the dimensionless orifice size on the abscissa. This procedure is repeated using incrementally larger orifice sizes until the hopper discharges without jamming for three consecutive times, as per the description of a "positive result" in the Flodex™ Operation Manual.<br>
(d) The plotted data are then linearly interpolated to find the Relative Jamming Onset (RJO), which is defined as the value of the dimensionless orifice size at the point of 25 mass% average discharge. This is determined by the abscissa value (b) at the point where the interpolation is equal to 25 mass% discharge. If the average mass% discharge exceeds 25% for the starting orifice, then flow disks with smaller orifices must be obtained and the test repeated starting with the smaller orifice. Flow disks with smaller orifices such as 3.5, 3.0, 2.5 or even 2.0 mm can be obtained as custom parts from Hanson Research Corporation.<br>
Bulk density<br>
The bulk density is typically measured by the following "bulk density test" method:<br>
Summary: A 500 ml graduated cylinder is filled with a powder, the weight of the sample is measured and the bulk density of the powder is calculated in g/1.<br>
Equipment:<br>
1.	Balance. The balance has a sensitivity of 0.5g.<br>
2.	Graduated cylinder. The graduated cylinder has a capacity 500ml. The cylinder should be calibrated at the 500ml mark, by using 500g of water at 20°C. The cylinder is cut off at the 500ml mark and ground smooth.<br><br>
3.	Funnel. The funnel is cylindrical cone, and has a top opening of  110mm diameter, a bottom opening of 40mm diameter, and sides having a slope of 76.4° to the horizontal.<br>
4.	Spatula. The spatula is a flat metal piece having of a length of at least 1.5 times the diameter of the graduated cylinder.<br>
5.	Beaker. The beaker has a capacity of 600ml.<br>
6.	Tray. The tray is either a metal or plastic square, is smooth and level, and has a side length of at least 2 times the diameter of the graduated cylinder.<br>
7.	Ring stand.<br>
8.	Ring clamp.<br>
9.	Metal gate. The metal gate is a smooth circular disk having a diameter of at least greater than the diameter of the bottom opening of the funnel.<br>
Conditions: The procedure is earned out indoors at conditions of 20°C temperature, 1 x 105Nm-2 pressure and a relative humidity of 25%.<br>
Procedure:<br>
1.	Weigh the graduated cylinder to the nearest 0.5g using the balance. Place the graduated cylinder in the tray so that it is horizontal with the opening facing upwards.<br>
2.	Support the funnel on a ring clamp, which is then fixed to a ring stand such that the top of the funnel is horizontal and rigidly in position. Adjust the height of the funnel so that its bottom position is 38mm above the top centre of the graduated cylinder.<br>
3.	Support the metal gate so as to form an air-tight closure of the bottom opening of the funnel.<br>
4.	Completely fill the beaker with a 24 hour old powder sample and pour the powder sample into the top opening of the funnel from a height of 2cm above the top of the funnel.<br>
5.	Allow the powder sample to remain in the funnel for 10 seconds, and then quickly and completely remove the metal gate so as to open the bottom opening of the funnel and allow the powder sample to fall into the graduated cylinder such that it completely fills the graduated cylinder and forms an overtop. Other than the flow of the powder sample,<br><br>
 no other external force, such as tapping, moving, touching, shaking, etc, is applied to the graduated cylinder. This is to minimize any further compaction of the powder sample.<br>
6.	Allow the powder sample to remain in the graduated cylinder for 10 seconds, and then carefully remove the overtop using the flat edge of the spatula so that the graduated cylinder is exactly full. Other than carefully removing the overtop, no other external force, such as tapping, moving, touching, shaking, etc, is applied to the graduated cylinder. This is to minimize any further compaction of the powder sample.<br>
7.	Immediately and carefully transfer the graduated cylinder to the balance without spilling any powder sample. Determine the weight of the graduated cylinder and its powder sample content to the nearest 0.5g.<br>
8.	Calculate the weight of the powder sample in the graduated cylinder by subtracting the weight of the graduated cylinder measured in step 1 from the weight of the graduated cylinder and its powder sample content measured in step 7.<br>
9.	Immediately repeat steps 1 to 8 with two other replica powder samples.<br><br>
10.	Determine the mean weight of all three powder samples.<br>
11.	Determine the bulk density of the powder sample in g/1 by multiplying the mean weight calculated in step 10 by 2.0.<br>
Volume fraction<br>
The volume fraction is calculated based on the mass in wt% and the bulk density. The volume fraction of the aesthetic particle (Vbead) = (pbase x Mbead) / [(pbase x Mbead) + (Pbead x Mbase)]- The volume fraction of the remainder of the solid particulate laundry detergent composition (Vbase) = (pbead x Mbead / [(pbead x Mbase) + (pbase x Mbead)], wherein Mbead is the amount in wt% of the aesthetic particle, and wherein Mbase is the amount in wt% of the remainder of the solid particulate laundry detergent composition. Mbead + Mbase = 1.0.<br>
Median particle size<br>
The median particle size is typically measured by the following "flowable particle mass based cumulative particle size distribution test" method:<br><br>
This test is conducted to determine the median particle size using ASTM D 502 -89, "standard test method for particle size of soaps and other detergents", approved May 26, 1989, with a further specification for sieve sizes used in the analysis. Following section 7, "procedure using machine-sieving method," a nest of clean dry sieves containing U.S. standard (ASTM Ell) sieves #8 (2360 urn), #12 (1700 um). #16 (1180 um), #20 (850 um), #30 (600 um), #40 (425 um). #50 (300 um), #70 (212 um), #100 (150 um) is required.   The prescribed machine-sieving method is used with the above sieve nest. A suitable sieve-shaking machine can be obtained from W.S. Tyler Company of Mentor, Ohio, U.S.A.<br>
The data are plotted on a semi-log plot with the micron size opening of each sieve plotted against the logarithmic abscissa and the cumulative mass percent (Q3) plotted against the linear ordinate. An example of the above data representation is given in ISO 9276-1:1998, "Representation of results of particle size analysis - Part I: Graphical Representation", Figure A.4. The median particle size (D50), for the purpose of this invention, is defined as the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative mass percent is equal to 50 percent, and is calculated by a straight line interpolation between the data points directly above (a50) and below (b50) the 50% value using the following equation: Dso = 10^[Log(Da50) - (Log(Da50) - Log(Db5o))*(Qa5o- 50%)/(Qa5o - Qb50)], where Qa50 and Qb50 are the cumulative mass percentile values of the data immediately above and below the 50th percentile, respectively; and Da5o and Db5o are the micron sieve size values corresponding to these data.<br>
In the event that the 50th percentile value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um) or above the coarsest sieve size (2360 um), then additional sieves must be added to the nest following a geometric progression of not greater than 1.5, until the median falls between two measured sieve sizes.<br>
The Distribution Span of the sample is a measure of the breadth of the particle size distribution about the median. It is calculated according to the following: Span - (D84/D50 + D50/D16) / 2, where D50 is the median particle size and D84and D16, are the particle sizes at the sixteenth and eighty-fourth percentiles on the cumulative mass percent retained plot, respectively. In the event that the D16 value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um), then the span is calculated according to the following; Span = (D84/D50). In the event<br><br>
that the D84 value falls above the coarsest sieve size (2360 um), then the span is calculated according to the following: Span = (D50/D16), In the event that the D16, value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um) and the D84 value falls above the coarsest sieve size (2360 um), then the distribution span is taken to be a maximum value of 5.7.<br>
In addition, the 30lh percentile particle size (D30) of the sample can also be measured. The 30   percentile particle size (D30) is defined as the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative mass percent is equal to 30 percent, and is calculated by a straight line interpolation between the data points directly above (a30) and below (b30) the 30% value using the following equation; D30 = 10A[Log(Da3o) - (Log(Da3o) -Log(Db3o))*(Qa3o - 30%)/(Qa30 - Qb3o)] where Qa3o and Qb3o are the cumulative mass percentile values of the data immediately above and below the 30lh percentile, respectively; and Da3o and Db3o are the micron sieve size values corresponding to these data.<br>
In the event that the 30Ih percentile value falls below the finest sieve size (150 um), then additional sieves must be added to the nest following a geometric progression of not greater than 1.5, until the 30th percentile falls between two measured sieve sizes.<br>
Median aspect ratio<br>
The particle aspect ratio is defined as the ratio of the particle's major axis diameter (dmajor) relative to the particle's minor axis diameter (dminor). where the major and minor axis diameters are the long and short sides of a rectangle that circumscribes a 2-dimensional image of the particle at the point of rotation where the short side of the rectangle is minimized. The 2-dimensional image is obtained using a suitable microscopy technique. For the purpose of this method, the particle area is defined to be the area of the 2-dimensional particle image.<br>
In order to determine the aspect ratio distribution and the median particle aspect ratio, a suitable number of representative 2-dimensional particle images must be acquired and analyzed. For the purpose of this test, a minimum of 5000 particle images is required. In order to facilitate collection and image analysis of this number of particles, an automated imaging and analysis system is recommended. Such systems can be obtained from Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, United Kingdom; Beckman<br><br><br>
Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, California, USA; JM Canty, Inc.. Buffalo, New York, USA; Retsch Technology GmbH, Haan, Germany; and Sympatec GmbH, Clausthal-Zellerfeld. Germany.<br>
A suitable sample of particles is obtained by riffling. The sample is then processed and analyzed by the image analysis system, to provide a list of particles containing major and minor axis attributes. The aspect ratio (AR) of each particle is calculated according to the ratio of the particle's major and minor axis, AR = dmajor / dminor.<br>
The list of data are then sorted in ascending order of particle aspect ratio and the cumulative particle area is calculated as the running sum of particle areas in the sorted list. The particle aspect ratio is plotted against the abscissa and the cumulative particle area against the ordinate. The median particle aspect ratio (AR50) is the abscissa value at the point where the cumulative particle area is equal to 50% of the total particle area of the distribution.<br>
EXAMPLES Example I<br>
The particle comprises of a core, a liquid binder and a coating powder. These materials are mixed together in a series of batch mixes to create the final 1.4mm to 2.0mm sized aesthetic bead, as follows.<br>
Batch 1: The core material is screened granular sodium sulphate prepared by a classification between 500 micrometer and 1000 micrometer screens. The layering powder is sodium carbonate, milled using a Retsch ZM200 to produce a milled material of 
A mass of 200 grams of the core particles is loaded into a Kenwood FP520 Series mixer with a plastic bladed impeller and the mixer turned on to speed setting #1 to induce a centrifugal flow pattern in the mixer. A series of twenty sequential layering steps are then performed, alternately adding 2 grams of liquid binder drop-wise via a syringe, contacting the core particles in the mixer, followed by 6.9 grams of layering powder, also added through the top of the mixer, adding more binder, more layering powder, etc., until the product composition is built up in layers surrounding the core particles. 138 grams of<br><br>
layering powder is added in total. 40 grams of liquid binder is added into the mixer in total.<br>
The resulting coated particle is then screened through 1400 micrometers and on 850 micrometers. 200 grams are needed for the second batch as cores. If this yield is not achieved. Batch 1 is repeated to achieve a total of 200 grams of Batch 1 coated material between 850 micrometers and 1400 micrometers.<br>
Batch 2: The core material is Batch 1 coated material. The layering powder is sodium Carbonate, milled using a Retsch ZM200 to produce a milled material of 
A mass of 200g of the core particles is loaded into a Kenwood FP520 Series mixer with a plastic bladed impeller and the mixer turned on to speed setting #1 to induce a centrifugal flow pattern in the mixer. A series of eleven sequential layering steps are then performed, alternately adding 3 grams of liquid binder drop-wise via a syringe, contacting the core particles in the mixer, followed by 11.7 grams of layering powder, also added through the top of the mixer, adding more binder, more layering powder, etc., until the product composition is built up in layers surrounding the core particles.  129 grams of layering powder is added in total. 33 grams of liquid binder is added into the mixer in total.<br>
The resulting coated particle is then screened through 1400 mircometers and on 850 micrometers. 228 grams are needed for the third batch as cores, if this yield is not achieved, Batch 1 and 2 are repeated to achieve a total of 228 grams of Batch 2 coated material between 850 micrometers and 1400 micrometers.<br>
Batch 3: The core material is Batch 2 coated material. The layering powder is sodium Carbonate, milled using a Retsch ZM200 to produce a milled material of 
Liquid pre-mix 1: 2R sodium silicate - 29.6%w/w, lexonyl orange dye - 1.4%w/w, water-69.0%w/w<br>
A mass of 228g of the core particles is loaded into a Kenwood FP520 Series mixer with a plastic bladed impeller and the mixer turned on to speed setting #1 to induce a<br><br><br>
centrifugal flow pattern in the mixer. A series of ten sequential layering steps are then performed, alternately adding 5 grams of liquid binder drop-wise via a syringe, contacting the core particles in the mixer, followed by 18 grams of layering powder, also added through the top of the mixer, adding more binder, more layering powder, etc., until the product composition is built up in layers surrounding the core particles. 180 grams of layering powder is added in total. 50 grams of liquid binder is added into the mixer in total.<br>
The resulting coated particle is then screened through 2000 micrometers and on 1400 micrometers. The resulting particle is extremely free flowing with a relative jamming onset of 5.7, has a median particle size of 1,500 micrometers, bulk density of 1,049g/1, and extremely spherical with a median aspect ratio of 1.1.<br>
