				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cladding elements, more particularly to cladding<br>
elements adapted for side by side assembly with a like element.<br>
The invention has been primarily developed in relation to cladding elements<br>
which can be connected together along their longitudinal edges to provide roofing/ceiling<br>
sheets. However, it will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that the invention is<br>
not limited to this particular use and also finds application in walling, decking and other<br>
types of cladding.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Australian patent no. 711048 discloses a cladding sheet marketed by BHP Steel<br>
Pty Ltd under the Trade Mark FLATDEK. FLATDEK has a substantially flat web with<br>
generally triangular male and female formations along opposed longitudinal edges. The<br>
primarily usage of FLATDEK is of a roofing sheet with the web fastened to a supporting<br>
structure, such as battens or purlins by nails or screws which pierce the sheets and engage<br>
the support structure. The sheets are installed by pivoting the female formation of the<br>
sheet being installed over, and into engagement with, the male formation of the last<br>
installed sheet.<br>
A disadvantage of FLATDEK is the sheets can only be connected by pivoting<br>
the female formation over the male formation. This means that, when installing from<br>
within a room, FLATDEK can only be installed as ceiling sheets with the male and<br>
female formations projecting into the room space, which is visually undesirable.<br>
Accordingly, FLATDEK is normally only used a roof sheet.<br>
Another disadvantage of FLATDEK is the fasteners used to attach it to the<br>
support structure are visible. This is also visually undesirable.<br>
The disadvantages described above in relation to FLATDEK are shared by the<br>
majority of the cladding sheets presently available.<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to substantially overcome, or at least<br>
ameliorate, one or more of the disadvantages.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, in a first aspect, the present invention provides a cladding element<br>
for use in a cladding element assembly, the cladding element including:<br>
a substantially flat web having a pair of opposed longitudinal edges;<br>
a male rib formation extending at least partially along one longitudinal edge and<br>
having a pair of spaced apart inner and outer upstanding ribs and an engaging formation;<br>
and<br>
a female rib formation extending at least partially along the other longitudinal<br>
edge and having an inner upstanding rib, an outer depending rib and a joining section,<br>
between the inner and outer ribs and displaced from the plane of the web, and a<br>
corresponding engaging formation, at least one of the male or female rib formations being<br>
at least partially resiliency flexible,<br>
wherein the element is adapted for assembly with a like element by positioning<br>
of the male formation substantially within the female formation with their respective<br>
engaging formations in engagement, whereby the assembled male and female formations<br>
together form a substantially rectangular closed channel adapted for concealment of<br>
fixing means used to fix the cladding elements to a supporting structure.<br>
When the major visible surface of the web is the side remote from the male and<br>
female formations, the fixing means are positioned between the inner and outer ribs of the<br>
male formation. When the major visible surface of the web is the side adjacent to the<br>
male and female formations, the fixing means are positioned in the joining section (ie.<br>
between the inner and outer ribs of the female formation).<br>
In one form, the engaging formation of the male rib formation is a flange angled<br>
inwardly and towards the web on the distal end of the inner male rib formation and the<br>
corresponding engaging formation of the female rib formation is a flange angled inwardly<br>
and away from the web on the distal end of the outer female rib formation. At least one<br>
of the inner male rib or the outer female rib are preferably flexible to allow resilient<br>
flexing displacement as the angled flanges ride over one another during engagement.<br>
The male and female rib formations are preferably both resiliently flexible.<br>
In another form, the .engaging formation of the male rib formation is an<br>
outwardly directed flange on the distal end of the outer male rib formation and the<br>
corresponding engaging formation of the female rib formation is an outwardly directed<br>
recess on the distal end of the inner female rib formation.<br>
The cladding element preferably include both forms of the engaging formations<br>
defined above.<br>
Preferably, the proximal end of the outer male rib formation includes an<br>
outwardly convex formation adapted to engage with an inwardly concave formation on<br>
the proximal end of the outer male rib formation.<br>
The cladding element is preferably formed from a single piece of roll formed<br>
steel.<br>
The male rib formation is preferably formed by folding some of the web back on<br>
itself. A layer of adhesive is preferably included between at least some of the web that is<br>
folded back on itself.<br>
In one embodiment, the layer of adhesive is an adhesive strip, most preferably<br>
VHB (Trade Mark) tape marketed by the 3M company. In another embodiment, the layer<br>
of adhesive is a glue, most preferably Jetweld TS230 (Trade Mark).<br>
The web preferably includes a plurality, most preferably two, longitudinal<br>
stiffening channels. The channels are preferably convex towards the rib formations.<br>
In a second aspect, the present invention provides a cladding element for use in a<br>
cladding element assembly, the cladding element including:<br>
a substantially flat web;<br>
a longitudinal interlocking formation formed by folding at least some of the web<br>
back onto itself; and<br>
a layer of adhesive between at least some of the adjacent web folded back on<br>
itself.<br>
In one embodiment, the layer of adhesive is an adhesive strip, most preferably<br>
VHB (Trade Mark) tape marketed by the 3M company. In another embodiment, the layer<br>
of adhesive is a glue, most preferably Jetweld TS230 (Trade Mark).<br>

Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring firstly to Fig. 1, there is shown a first embodiment of a cladding<br>
element 10 according to the invention. The element 10 is formed from a strip of 0.42mm<br>
base metal thickness (BMT) sheet steel. The element 10 is preferably produced by role<br>
forming, as will be described in more detail with reference to Fig. 6.<br>
The element 10 has a substantially flat central web 12 with a male rib formation<br>
14 extending along one longitudinal edge and a female rib formation 16 extending along<br>
the other longitudinal edge. When the element 10 is used as a roofing or ceiling sheet, the<br>
web side 12' is the lower most part (ie. the underside). When the element 10 is used as a<br>
wall cladding sheet, the web side 12' is that which is visible from within the clad room.<br>
The web 12 also has a pair of longitudinally extending, substantially parallel,<br>
spaced apart minor stiffening ribs 18, which are convex in the same direction as the male<br>
and female rib formations 14,16.<br>
The web is approximately 260mm wide with the stiffening ribs 18 being<br>
approximately 12mm wide and extending away from the plane of the rib by about 5mm.<br>
The male rib formation 14 is approximately 26mm wide and extends away from plane of<br>
the web 12 by about 44mm. The female rib formation is approximately 37mm wide and<br>
extends away from plane of the web 12 by about 45mm. The elements 10 are generally<br>
produced in lengths of about 6 meters, with lengths of up to about 9.6 meters possible<br>
(generally subject to transporting limitations).<br>
The male rib formation 14 comprises an inner upstanding rib 20 having an<br>
angled flange 22 on its distal end. The flange 22 is angled inwardly and towards the web<br>
12. The male rib formation 14 also includes an outer upstanding rib 24 that has an<br>
outwardly directed flange 26 at its distal end and an outwardly convex channel 28 at its<br>
proximal end. The male formation 14, with the exception of the inner rib 20, is of double<br>
thickness to that of the web 12 and is formed by folding the web over and back on to<br>
itself, as will become more evident from Fig. 6. This folding advantageously allows the<br>
element 10 to be formed from a single piece of steel.<br>
The female rib formation 16 has an inner upstanding rib 30 with an outwardly<br>
concave recess 32 at its distal end and an outwardly concave channel 34 at its proximal<br>
end. A joining section 36 extends outwardly from the distal end of the inner rib 30 and is<br>
substantially parallel to and displaced from the web 12. An outer rib 38 depends from the<br>
joining section 36 and has an angled flanged 40 at its distal end. The flange 40 is angled<br>
inwardly and away from the web 12.<br>
In the preferred embodiment shown, the thin sheet metal construction of the<br>
element 10 results in various components of the male and female rib formations 14, <br>
being resiliently flexible under load and able to be displaced from the positions and<br>
orientations shown in Fig. 1 and resiliently returned to those orientations when no longer<br>
subject to load.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the cladding element 10, and a like cladding element 10', during<br>
installation as a roofing sheet and being fastened to a supporting batten 42. The<br>
installation process begins with the cladding element 10 being iastened adjacent the male<br>
rib formation 14 by a fastener, such as a self tapping/drilling screw 44. The screw 44 is<br>
driven threw the element 10 between the inner and outer ribs 20 and 24 of the male rib<br>
formation 14. The female rib portion 16 of the cladding element 10' is pressed over the<br>
male rib formation 14 of the cladding element 10 and into locking engagement with same.<br>
During this engaging process, the rib 38 flexes outwardly as indicated by arrow 46 and<br>
the rib 20 flexes inwardly as indicated generally by the arrow 48 until the angled flange<br>
22 is received into engagement with the angled flange 40 as shown in Fig. 3. When this<br>
occurs the flange 26 is also located within the recess 32 and the channel 28 located within<br>
the channel 34. There may also be some flexing of the rib formation 24 and 30 during the<br>
engaging process, as indicating generally by arrows 50 and 52. The engaging process can<br>
also be assisted by initially tilting the element 10' away from the element 10 to initially<br>
position the flange 22 hi engagement with the flange 40 and then pivoting the remainder<br>
of the male and female rib formations 14 and 16 into engagement with one another, as<br>
indicated generally by the arrow 54.<br>
Successive elements can thus be sequentially attached to another by following a<br>
similar method. The right hand end of the element 10 is preferably fixed to the batten <br>
by initially fastening a section of cladding element 10 that comprises only the male rib<br>
formation 14 (not shown) and engaging the cladding element 10 with that formation 14 in<br>
the manner previously described.<br>
With reference to Fig. 3, it can be seen that the male and female rib formations<br>
14, 16 form, after assembly, a substantially rectangular closed channel 56 which<br>
advantageously conceals the screw 44. This advantageously obviates the need for any<br>
additional concealed fixing devices or clips, as are required for known cladding sheets.<br>
Further, the sheet material adjacent the recesses 28,32 forms a downwardly concave<br>
recess 58 in the bottom left hand comer of the channel 56, which substantially replicates<br>
the stiffening channels 18 and thus provides a uniform surface appearance to the cladding<br>
elements 10,10' etc when viewed in the direction of arrow 60.<br>
The installation of the cladding element 10 as a ceiling sheet will now be<br>
described with references to Figs. 4 and 5 with like reference numerals used to indicate<br>
like features hi Figs. 1 to 3.<br>
Turning firstly to Fig. 4, the element 10 is initially fastened to the batten 42 by<br>
passing the screw 44 through the connecting section 36 of the female rib formation 16.<br>
The cladding element 10' is then introduced into the position generally shown in Fig. <br>
and manoeuvred, in the direction of arrow 62, into engagement with the female rib<br>
formation 16 of the element 10 as indicated in Fig. 5. During the engaging process the<br>
ribs 20 and 40 flex, as generally indicated by arrows 46 and 48. There may also be some<br>
slight flexing of the rib 24 as generally indicated by arrow 50. The rib 30 will generally<br>
not flex due to it being constrained by the attachment of the element 10 of the batten 42.<br>
As with the roofing sheet installation, the male and female rib formations 14, 16<br>
form, after assembly, the substantially rectangular closed channel 56 which conceals the<br>
screw 44. Further, and again similar to the roofing sheet installation, the male and female<br>
rib formations 14, 16 also form a downwardly convex channel 58 which replicates those<br>
provided by the ribs 18 to provide a uniform and attractive ceiling appearance when<br>
viewed in the direction of arrow 60. The left hand end of the cladding element 10 is<br>
initially fastened to the batten 42 by engagement with a female rib formation 16 (not<br>
shown) previously fastened to the batten 42.<br>
Figs. 4 and 5 also represent the top view of an installation of the element 10 as a<br>
wall cladding with the surface 12' of the web 12 presenting a uniform, visually appearing,<br>
surface to the interior of the clad room.<br>
The forming of the closed channels 50 described above also provides improved<br>
resistance to leaking compared to known cladding sheets, which rely on the rubber<br>
washers between the exposed fastener heads and the cladding sheets. Further, when a<br>
roofing installer is notching a tile flushing for a flush fit with the roofing cladding, the<br>
substantially rectangular channel 56 is a much easier shape for the notched flushing to<br>
conform to. This results in reduced installation times and less chance of gaps and<br>
associated leaks.<br>
As mentioned above, the element 10 is preferably formed form a single piece of<br>
metal by roll forming in accordance with the process shown in the roll forming flower<br>
diagram of Fig. 6.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown a second embodiment of a cladding<br>
element 70 according to the invention. Like reference numerals to those used hi<br>
describing the first embodiment have been used to indicate like features in the second<br>
embodiment.<br>
The element 70 is also formed from a strip of 0.42mm base metal thickness<br>
(BMT) sheet steel and produced by the role forming process described with reference to<br>
Fig. 6. The roll forming process includes folding the web 12 back onto itself to form the<br>
male rib formation 14. This also results in there being two adjacent web layers 72 and 74,<br>
between the inner and outer upstanding ribs 20 and 24.<br>
In the element 70, a 6mm wide strip of adhesive 76 (darkened region) is inserted<br>
between the layers 72 and 74 to prevent them from separating. The adhesive strip is<br>
preferably VHB (Trade Mark) tape marketed by the 3M company. The tape is fed into<br>
the roll former during the roll forming process. Jetweld TS230 glue could also be used<br>
but the tape is easier to incorporate into the roll forming process.<br>
As stated above, the adhesive strip 76 prevents the two web layers 72 and 74<br>
from separating. This advantageously allows longer spans of the element 70 to be<br>
installed between fixings when compared to the element 10. Alternatively, the element<br>
70 can withstand higher wind loads than the element 10, when installed with similar<br>
fixing spacing.<br>
Although the invention has been described with reference to a preferred<br>
embodiment, it would be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the invention may be<br>
embodied in many other forms. For example, although it is preferred, it is not necessary<br>
for the male and female rib formation to extend over the entire length of the cladding<br>
elements. An alternative is a series of discrete spaced apart lengths of male and female<br>
rib formations. Further, the element can alternatively be formed from sheets of plastics or<br>
other materials.<br><br>
