				<td>The present invention relates to a novel process for preparing a cephem compound of formula (II). The invention also relates to novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of general formula (I), useful as an intermediate for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics having general formula (II). In addition, the present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of thioester derivatives. The present invention also provides for a process for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics using said thioester derivatives.<br><br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Use of acid chlorides, anhydrides, esters, amide etc. is reported in the chemical literature for activation of carboxylic acid of formula (TV).<br><br><br>
Activation of acid (IV) is reported by SO2CI2/DMF in US patent 5,856,502 and SOCI2/DMF in US patent 5,037,988. These processes suffer the hmitation of using harmful and pungent smelling chemicals like SOCI2, SO2CI2 along with solvents like benzene, toluene, etc. and involving stringent conditions for carrying out the reactions on commercial scale.<br>
In US patent Nos. 4,576,749 and 4,548,748, the acid of formula (IV) has also been activated by reacting with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT) or 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) in the presence of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) to produce reactive ester of the acid (IV) which is then reacted with cephem moiety to prepare cephalosporin antibiotics, but the processes are time consuming accompanied with low yields, hence, not suitable. US patent No. 4767852 discloses a process for production of cephems by acylating 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid with 2-mercaptobenzothiazolyl-(Z)-2-(2-aminothiazol-4-yl)-2-methoxyiminoacetate (MAEM). Similarly, US Pat.No.5026843 (1991) disclosed a process for preparing ceftriaxone disodium hemiheptahydrate by acylation of 7-amino-3-[(2,5-dihydro-6-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-oxo-l,2,4-triazin-3yI)thiomethyl]-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid (7-ACT) by using MAEM as acylating agents in good yield and quality. Thus MAEM has become the standard acylating agent for the preparation of cephalosporins antibiotics having an octillion group and a 2-aminothiazolyl group in 7-position of cephem compounds.<br>
However, the synthesis of MAEM from acid (III) and 2,2"-dithio-bis-benzothiazole involves use of costly condensing agent triphenylphosphine (TPP). Moreover, during condensation of MAEM with 7-amino-3-cephem-4-carboxylic acid compound (III), a toxic compound 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) is also produced as a byproduct [Chemical Abstracts, 111, p.l9243 (1989)], which is difficult to remove. Thus, it is evident that the procedures described in the prior art for the preparation of these cephalosporin antibiotics are complex, involving protection, deprotection and also associated with generation of toxic byproduct. Hence, there is a need to develop new acylating agents which are capable of transferring the 2-aminothiazolyl moiety to cephem compounds of formula (III) in good yield, without producing this toxic byproduct. On the similar lines, a new thioester was reported by D.G.Walker, Tet. Lett. 1990, 31,6481 to<br><br>
acylate the cephem moiety to get cefepime sulfate but yields obtained by using this thioester were in the range of 54-73% which cannot be considered as good yield to operate a process at commercial scale. The same thioester is exploited in US patent No. 5869649 for making three more important cephalosporin antibiotics.<br>
In the CO pending application US Application No. 09/754,302, the Applicant has disclosed another novel thioester derivatives of thiazole acetic acid and its use in the synthesis of various cephalosporin antibiotics. In continuation of search for more such derivatives, the Applicant has observed that the title compound (I) works equally well and also has the similar advantages as described in the aforementioned US application.<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The primary objective of this invention is to provide novel thioester derivatives of thiazolyl<br>
acetic acid of formula (I) used for the preparation of cephalosporin antibiotics of formula<br>
(II).<br>
Another objective of this invention is to prepare new thioester derivatives of thiazolyl<br>
acetic acid of formula (I) which is better than the earlier reactive derivatives and also<br>
suitable for being used in the manufacture of cephalosporin antibiotics.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the synthesis of<br>
thioester derivatives of formula (I) from thiazolyl acetic acid of formula (IV) and 1,2,5,6<br>
tetrahydro-2-methyl-5, 6- dioxo-l,2,4-triazin-3-thiol (VI).<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics of general formula (II) at low temperature, which will be simple<br>
and cost effective.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to produce cephalosporin antibiotics<br>
having high purity and free from toxic byproducts.<br>
One more objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of<br>
cephalosporin antibiotics of general formula (II) from said novel thioester derivatives.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a new thioester derivatives of thiazolyl acetic acid of<br>
formula (I) and also provides a method by which the said thioester derivatives can be<br>
prepared by reacting thiazolyl acetic acid of general formula (IV) with the commercially<br><br>
  available 1,2,5,6 tetrahydro-2-methyl-5,6 dioxo-l,2,4-triazin-3-thiol (VI) using Vilsmeier reagent (V) as a condensing agent. (Ber. 60B, 119 (1927), The thioester derivatives thus obtained are reacted with 7-amino-cephem carboxylic acids of general formula (III) to produce cephalosporin antibiotic compounds of general formula (II) as described above. The cephalosporin antibiotics obtained are of high purity (95-99%), The method is workable on commercial scale without necessitating the protection of the amino group of the acylating agents, and avoiding the generation of the toxic byproduct 2-mercaptobenzothiazole.<br><br>
