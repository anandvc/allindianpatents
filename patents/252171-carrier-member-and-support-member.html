TITLE OF THE  INVENTION<br>
CARRIER MEMBER AND SUPPORT MEMBER<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a carrier member for holding a volatile component, and to a support member using the carrier member. The carrier member and the support member can be used for a fan-type volatilizing apparatus.<br>
An insect-pest-control apparatus which uses a volatile insect-pest-control component as a volatile component is known. The volatile insect-pest-control component is, for example, a volatile insecticidal component or a volatile insect-pest-repellent component.<br>
Such insect-pest-control apparatus includes two kinds of types. One is a heating-type and the other is a non-heating-type. The heating- type apparatus helps the volatilization of the insect-pest-control component by a heater or combustion heat etc. The non-heating-type apparatus volatilize the insect-pest-control component under an ordinary temperature.<br>
The heating-type apparatus was mainly used as the conventional   insect-pest-control   apparatus.      However,    in<br><br>
recent years, the non-heating-type apparatus is remarkable instead of the heating-type apparatus. Because, the non-heating-type apparatus does not need a heating source and also suits for use at indoor and outdoor.<br>
A fan-type apparatus is put into practical use as one example of the non-heating type apparatus. The fan-type apparatus has a fan and a support member. The support member holds the volatile component. In the fan-type apparatus, the fan blows airflow to the support member, so that the volatile component is released from the support member into the atmosphere.<br>
The support member is comprised of a carrier member impregnated with the volatile component. The carrier member comprised of a corrugated paper is disclosed in the following patent document 1.<br>

DETAILED	DESCRIPTION	OF	THE	PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
Some embodiments of the carrier members of the present invention are described below. The carrier member is a member for holding the volatile component such as the insect-pest-control component. The support member is the carrier member which held the volatile component. (First Embodiment)<br>
The construction and function of the carrier member of the first embodiment of the present invention are described below.<br>
Fig.3 is a perspective view explaining the fundamental construction of the carrier member of the first embodiment. Fig.4 and Fig.5 are modification examples of the carrier member shown in Fig.3, respectively.<br>
As shown in Fig.3, the carrier member 1 of the first embodiment has a structure in which connecting fibers 2, 11 are included inside a virtual space. Therefore, the carrier   member   1   has   a   high   opportunity   for   the   volatile<br><br>
component   to   touch   a   blow,   and   has   high   volatilization efficiency.<br>
That is, the carrier member 1 of the first embodiment has a three-dimensional structure which is constructed by a front surface layer 3 made of fabrics, a back surface layer 5 made of fabrics, and three connecting fibers 2, 11 and 12. The connecting fibers connect the layer 3 and the layer 5. The front surface layer 3 has a knitted fabric structure, and has openings 6 which are arranged regularly. The back surface layer 5 has a knitted fabric structure, and has openings 8 which are arranged regularly.<br>
As shown in Fig.3, the opening 6 is composed of lines 15. The line 15 is a bundle of fibers. Although the line 15 has many meshes, the mesh is distinguished from the opening 6. That is, the opening 6 is surrounded with the line 15 having the mesh. A size of the opening 6 is usually more than 1mm2 and is preferably more than 4mm2. The opening 8 is the same as those of the opening 6.<br>
In the carrier member 1, a part of the connecting fiber 2 and a part of the connecting fiber 11 are included inside the virtual space surrounded with layer 3, layer 5 and virtual vertical walls. The virtual vertical walls are extended downwardly from inner edges of the lines 15 of the opening 6.<br>
That is,  in the first embodiment,  the opening 6 of the<br><br>
front surface layer 3 is connected with the opening 8 of the back surface layer 5 by three connecting fibers 2, 11 and 12, and a part of the connecting fiber 2 and a part of the connecting fiber 11  are included inside the virtual space.<br>
Referring to Fig.3, in the carrier member 1 of the first embodiment, parts of two connecting fibers 2 and 11 in three connecting fibers 2, 11 and 12 are included in the three-dimensional virtual space which is surrounded with chain double-dashed lines A, B, C and D.<br>
That is, a plane surrounded with chain double-dashed lines A and B is a virtual vertical wall X, a plane surrounded with chain double-dashed lines B and C is a virtual vertical wall Y, a plane surrounded with chain double-dashed lines C and D is a virtual vertical wall Z, a plane surrounded with chain double-dashed lines D and E is a virtual vertical wall 0. In the carrier member 1 of the first embodiment, parts of the connecting fibers 2 and 11 are included in the three-dimensional virtual space which is surrounded with the vertical wall X, Y, Z and 0.<br>
More specifically, the opening 6 of the front surface layer 3 is a quadrangle surrounded with corner parts a, b, c and d as shown in Fig.3. The back surface layer 5 facing to the front surface layer 3 has also the opening 8 surrounded with corner parts a', b\ c' and d\ The corner part a and the  corner part a'  are  in the corresponding  positions.    The<br><br>
corner part b and the corner part b' are in the corresponding positions. The corner part c and the corner part c' are in the corresponding positions. The corner part d and the corner part d* are in the corresponding positions.<br>
The connecting fiber 2 connects the line part a-b of the front surface layer 3 and the line part b'-c' of the back surface layer 5. The connecting fiber 2 has a curved portion. A part of the connecting fiber 2 is included in the virtual space surrounded with the vertical walls X, Y, Z and 0.<br>
The other connecting fiber 11 connects the line part c-d of the front surface layer 3 and the line part d'-a' of the back surface layer 5. A part of the connecting fiber 11 is also included in the virtual space surrounded with the vertical walls X, Y, Z and 0.<br>
In a plan view of the carrier member 1 of the first embodiment, parts of the connecting fibers 2 and 11 can be seen inside the quadrangular opening 6.<br>
According to the carrier member 1 of the first embodiment, air blow enters into the inside of the carrier member 1 from the opening 6 and passes through the back surface layer 5, as indicated by an arrow mark. However, in the first embodiment, since parts of the connecting fibers 2 and 11 are included in the virtual space, which is surrounded with the vertical walls X,  Y,  Z and  0 and  is  an<br><br>
air blow flow channel in the carrier member 1, the air blow touches the connecting fibers 2 and 11.<br>
The connecting fibers 2 and 11 have respectively a curved portion. However, since the connecting fibers 2 and 11 connect the front surface layer 3 and the back surface layer 5, the connecting fibers 2 and 11 have respectively a part extending along the direction of flow of the air blow. Therefore, when the air blow passes through the carrier member 1, the air blow touches the connecting fibers 2 and 11 for a relatively long time and volatilizes the volatile component held by the connecting fibers 2and 11.<br>
In the first embodiment, since parts of the connecting fibers 2 and 11 are included in the virtual space, which is an air blow flow channel in the carrier member 1, the connecting fibers 2 and 11 become obstacles for the air blow. Therefore, a slight turbulence occurs inside the carrier member 1 and promotes the volatilization of the volatile component.<br>
However, since the connecting fibers 2 and 11 extend along the direction of the flow of the air blow, the resistances of the connecting fibers 2 and 11 to the air blow are small. Therefore, the carrier member 1 can assure lots of air volume which pass through it.<br>
As mentioned above, the carrier member 1 has many opportunities  for  the   volatile   component   to   touch   the   air<br><br>
blow, and the carrier member 1 generates a small turbulence inside it, and the carrier member 1 can assure lots of air volume which pass through it. Therefore, the carrier member 1 is superior in ability to volatilize the volatile component held by the carrier member 1.<br>
In the carrier member 1 shown in Fig.3, the opening 6 of the front surface layer 3 is in the same position as the opening 8 of the back surface layer 5. However, the opening 6 and the opening 8 may be not in the same positions as shown in Fig.4. When the opening 6 and the opening 8 is not in the same positions, the carrier member 1 increases opportunities for the volatile component to touch the air blow. However, the resistance to the air blow is increased and the pass air volume is decreased. Therefore, it is desirable that more than 70% of the area of one of the openings 6 and 8 are overlapped with the other of the openings 6 and 8.<br>
As shown in Fig.5, the connecting fibers 2 and 11 may come across the virtual space surrounded with the vertical walls X, Y, Z and 0.<br>
That is, in the carrier member 1 as shown in Fig.5, the connecting fiber 2 connects the line part d-a of the front surface layer 3 and the line part b'-c' of the back surface layer 5. Since the line part d-a of the front surface layer 3 faces to the line part b'-c'  of the back surface layer 5 in  a<br><br>
three-dimensionally oblique direction, the connecting fiber 2 comes across the virtual space surrounded with the vertical walls X, Y, Z and 0.<br>
The connecting fiber 11 connects a line part c-d of the front surface layer 3 with a line part a*-b' of the back surface layer 5. Since the line part c-d of the front surface layer 3 faces to the line part a'-b' of the back surface layer 5 in a three-dimensionally oblique direction, the connecting fiber 2 comes across the virtual space surrounded with the vertical walls X, Y, Z, 0.<br>
The connecting fiber 2 connects an edge part of the opening of the front surface layer and an edge part of the opening of the back surface layer. The edge part being connected with the connecting fiber 2 in the front surface layer and the edge part being connected with the connecting fiber 2 in the back surface layer are in a position facing to each other across the virtual space. Therefore, the connecting fiber 2 comes across the virtual space. The connecting fiber 11 is the same as those of the connecting fiber 2. (Second Embodiment)<br>
Fig.6A is a perspective view showing the carrier member according to the second embodiment. Fig.6B is a explanatory view explaining the relation between the openings and the connecting fibers.<br><br>
As shown in Fig.6A, the openings of the front surface layer 21 and the back surface layer 22 are hexagon and are more specifically hexagonal pattern. More specifically, as shown in Fig.6B, the opening 23 of the front surface layer 21 is composed of corner parts a, b, c, d, e and f. The opening 24 of the back surface layer 22 is composed of corner parts a1, b', c', d\ e' and f. In the opening 23, the line part b-c and the line part e-f facing the line part b»c are long, and the other line parts are short. A virtual space is composed of corner parts a, b, c, d, e, f, a\ b\ c\ d\ e' and f. The virtual space is surrounded with the layer 21, the layer 22 and the virtual vertical walls. The virtual vertical walls are extended downwardly from inner edges of the lines 15 of the opening 23.<br>
The width W (inner size) of the opening is 1.1mm~ 6.3mm, the length L of it is 1.3mm~7.7mm, and the entire height H of it is about 2.1 mm~11.9mm. The width w of the line 15 surrounding the opening is about 0.2mm~1.4mm.<br>
There   are   the   connecting   fibers   which   connect   the short   line   part  of  one   layer  and  the   long   line   part   of the other layer, and which come across the virtual space a, b, c, d, e, f, a', b\ c\ d\ e' and f.<br>
The carrier member 20 of the second embodiment has the connecting fibers 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33 and 34.<br><br>
The connecting fiber 26 connects the short line part a-b of the front surface layer 21 and the long line part e'-f of the back surface layer 22. In the opening 23, the short line part a-b is not adjacent to the long line part e-f. Meanwhile, the opening 23 and the opening 24 are overlapped in a plan view. That is, the long line part e-f of the opening 23 and the long line part e'-f of the opening 24 are overlapped in a plan view.    Therefore, the short line part a-b of the opening<br>
23	is not adjacent to the long line part e'-f of the opening<br>
24	in   a   plan   view.      According   to   this   construction,   the<br>
connecting fiber 26 comes across the virtual space.<br>

the back surface layer 22. Like the case of the connecting fiber 26, the short line part b-c is not adjacent to the long line part d'-e* in a plan view. Therefore, the connecting fiber 29 comes across the virtual space.<br>

provided for use after cutting it and then sewing or thermoforming it into the predetermined form.<br>
The support member according to the present invention can be obtained by making the carrier member hold the volatile component. Following methods can be used for making the carrier member hold the volatile component. One method has a step of impregnating the carrier member with the volatile component or a volatile solution and then drying the carrier member if necessary. The volatile solution is comprised of a suitable solvent in which the volatile component is dissolved. Other method has a step of applying the volatile component or the volatile solution to the carrier member and then drying the carrier member if necessary.<br>

temperature (for example, the vapor pressure at 25°C is 1 x<br>
10"6mmHg or more) and have the physiological activity (for<br>
example, perfume activity, insect-pest-control activity) can<br>
be used as the volatile component to be held by the carrier<br>
member. When the carrier member is used for the insect-<br>
pest-control apparatus of non-heating-type, especially the<br>
apparatus of fan-type, the effect of the carrier member is<br>
remarkable. It is preferred to use a volatile insect-pest-<br>
control component as the volatile component.	It is<br>
preferred   to   use   an   insect-pest-control   active   compound<br><br>
